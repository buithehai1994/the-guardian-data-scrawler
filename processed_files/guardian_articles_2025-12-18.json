It honours a body of work rather than a particular performance.The Irish actor has received critical plaudits and nominations for film and TV performances, and has won Irish film and television awards and a Berlin international film festival award, but had not landed a major Hollywood prize.View image in fullscreenDomhnall Gleeson as Bill Weasley with Mark Williams and Clemence Poesy in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy“I first saw Domhnall in 2006 when he played the role of Davey in Martin McDonagh’s play The Lieutenant of Inishmore,” said Trina Vargo, the founder and president of the US-Ireland Alliance. “His talent was obvious 20 years ago, it’s been a pleasure to watch him go from strength to strength, and we look forward to honouring him.”The US-Ireland Alliance is a nonprofit that fosters ties between the countries and is credited with hosting one of theliveliest partiesof Hollywood’s award season. Previous award recipients include Jamie Dornan, Kenneth Branagh and Kerry Condon.Next year’s ceremony will also honour Maura Tierney, who starred in Twisters and is best known for the TV series ER.Gleeson made his name on indies and blockbuster film franchises such as Harry Potter and Star Wars and is a proliferating presence on TV shows.He plays the editor of a struggling Ohio newspaper inThe Paper, a spin-off from the US version of The Office which follows the mockumentary format. He stars opposite Jessie Buckley in the forthcoming BBC Christmas special, The Scarecrows’ Wedding and did voiceovers for Ken Burns’ documentary The American Revolution.View image in fullscreenRachel McAdams with Gleeson in About Time, 2013.Photograph: Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarHe has also appeared in two Apple TV productions, Guy Ritchie’sFountain of Youth, with John Krasinski and Natalie Portman, and Echo Valley, with Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney.AnEsquire profilelast month said Gleeson’s performances have earned praise “even as he has somehow remained critically underrated”. The article was headlined: “Why isn’t everyone talking about Domhnall Gleeson?”The Dubliner was nominated for a Tony for The Lieutenant of Inishmore in 2006 and for a Golden Globe in 2023 for The Patient, in which he plays a serial killer opposite Steve Carell, but has missed out on Emmy and Oscar nominations.The son ofBrendan Gleeson, his filmography includes Ex Machina, Anna Karenina, True Grit, Brooklyn, Calvary, The Revenant andAbout Time, a time-travelling romcom. He played General Hux in the Star Wars reboot and Bill Weasley in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.“When he’s performing his appearance is almost fluid, absorbing the contours of his characters’ expressions so thoroughly that he sometimes appears reconfigured,” said Esquire. It noted his “alabaster skin and burnt-sienna eyebrows” – a more lyrical description than the Guardian, which called Gleeson a“ginger Hugh Grant”.Explore more on these topicsFilmIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Not from the MPs who are packing up to slope back to their constituencies for the Christmas recess, but from the rest of the country. Finally, the year is coming to an end and there will be few chances for our politicians to do any further damage before they return to Westminster in January.The psychodrama is finally done. We can all go to bed vaguely hopeful that the world won’t have taken a further turn for the worse by the time we wake up.By any standards, 2025 has been a momentous year in politics. One clusterfuck after another. Even more remarkably, possibly the first one in decades when Boris Johnson hasn’t got anyone pregnant. As far as we know.But before our politicians leave us in peace, there’s one final ritual to be observed: the Guardian’s parliamentarian of the year awards. A chance to remember just how lucky we are to have such a talented ruling elite.Here are the champions:The Eliot Ness investigation awardFor the first time ever, this award is to be shared between the prime minister and the chancellor. After a member of the Downing Street team rang up various political editors to say that Wes Streeting, Shabana Mahmood and Ed Miliband were all mounting a leadership challenge againstKeir Starmer, Starmer announced that he would be setting up an inquiry into why someone he had authorised to speak to the media had done as he asked.Normally, he can count on his own team’s disloyalty. So Starmer would now be interrogating Starmer on why Starmer had leaked a damaging story about Starmer. And he wouldn’t be taking yes for an answer.Meanwhile,Rachel Reeveswas setting up her own inquiry into why she had changed her mind about raising income tax in her November budget. Reeves would also be giving Reeves a strong talking to about why when Reeves leaks something it is called a briefing and when one of her team does the same thing it’s a leak.The HMRC self-assessment awardThere was one clear winner. Step forwardAngela Rayner. The former deputy prime minister bought a flat in Hove and, despite realising that the stamp duty had been complicated by the legal status of her disabled son’s trust fund, she chose to get her tax advice from someone she happened to meet in the pub who had said it would probably be OK. And who wouldn’t do that when you know the rightwing media are likely to be looking for any signs of wrongdoing?Later in the year, Rayner had hoped to recoup her tax liabilities by appearing on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! Unfortunately the show’s producers turned her down on the grounds that she was a genuine celebrity and they only took C-listers.Resignation of the yearBreaking with tradition, the prize this year goes to someone who has demanded a resignation. Encouraged by doing a little better at prime minister’s questions in the past month or so,Kemi Badenochhas taken to calling for the resignation of anyone she meets. Sometimes twice in the same speech.She once insisted that Rachel Reeves should resign for failing to obtain the correct rental licence, only to then insist the chancellor should unresign herself so that she could later resign again for breaking a manifesto promise.The list of people whose resignation Badenoch has now demanded includes the entire cabinet and shadow cabinet. Not forgetting herself. The number of people who have followed Badenoch’s advice is zero.Toady of the yearAs you might imagine, this is one of the most coveted and hotly contested awards. And it could easily have gone to any one of hundreds of MPs who have been only too willing to abandon their principles to further their career. Though not to Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary who declared that all his colleagues in the shadow cabinet were total nonentities. Pots and kettles, Rich.Instead, the winner for the 10th year in succession is shadow home secretary,Chris Philp. Not for nothing is he known as Westminster’s “Golden Nose in Search of a Bum”.Back in 2016, the Philpster could be founded praising George Osborne’s brilliant economic case for remain. Since then he has gone on to say almost anything to ingratiate himself with the Tory leadership. Probably still the only person to wholeheartedly endorse theLiz Trussmini-budget.Racist of the yearThis used to be the award no one wanted to win. But in 2025, racism has made a big comeback in politics and is the go-to fashion accessory for every rightwing MP hoping to make it big.It goes without saying that Honest Bob Jenrick andNigel Faragewere well up the shortlist. For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, Nige found it impossible to apologise to black and Jewish men who claim they had been abused by him while at school.One boy had been repeatedly told “Africa is that way” while another was informed that “Hitler was right”. Reform’s main defence is that he was not intentionally racist and in any case all 28 men were liars.Nonetheless, this year’s winner is Reform’s Sarah Pochin, who admitted she needs to projectile-vomit every time she sees a black or brown face in an advert. She now has to take anti-sickness medication before she enters the chamber in case there is a black person on the government benches.TV light entertainment personality of the yearShe is the gift that keeps on giving. Every time you think she has gone away for good, Liz Truss somehow manages to come back madder and funnier than ever before.Her January appearance filming the presidential inauguration from her Washington hotel after she realised she wasn’t actually invited to the event would have been enough to secure her the prize. But her turn as regular chatshow host on her own YouTube channel has been TV gold.Even by her own standards, this has been gloriously bonkers. Edited by a 12-year-old intern strung out on ketamine, each episode has Radon Liz talking about mad conspiracy theories with people almost as deranged as herself. Nothing is off limits. All levels of racism are welcome. Shortly to be made into a full-length feature film, provided she can stay out of the Priory for long enough.Overseas politician of the yearIt goes without saying thatDonald Trumpwould have won the Nobel peace prize had not the BBC broadcast a news report that the prize had been awarded to a Venezuelan woman instead.“They changed my prize,” he said. “It was a beautiful prize. Perhaps the most beautiful prize ever. I don’t really mind, because I never wanted the prize but they still should have given me the prize.“No man has done more for peace in the history of peace than I have. I’ve ended eight global conflicts. Including the one between Albania and Azerbaijan. That was so big, so big the Albaniainians and the Azzers had no idea they were even at war. No idea.“I blame the BBC. They are going to have to pay me a lot of money for interfering with the democratic process of another country now that my new national security strategy has shown that I plan to interfere with the democratic process of other countries. And by the way, I never met Peter Mandelson. Never heard of him.”To rectify the Nobel committee’s egregious error, the Guardian is happy to honour the US president with this prestigious award. Just so long as he still allows me to visit my daughter in Minneapolis.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerRachel ReevesLiz TrussAngela RaynerNigel FarageDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

They didn’t. They had parents and family and help with university. They are lovely men and kind to me, but I cannot converse with them on the issues of the day.They have had setbacks, but nothing that makes them realise how very difficult life can be. I want to tell them that they cannot always control life, and also that I disagree with them. What can I say?Eleanor says:You said you want to tell them you disagree, so I’ll join you in treating that as the starting point, though lots of people you talk to about this might knowingly say, “don’t try” or “keep politics away from the dinner table”. Yours was a strategic question;givenyou want to tell them you disagree, what can you say?My friend keeps sending me unsolicited conspiracy theory material. Should I ask them to stop? | Leading questionsRead moreReading your letter I kept thinking of the aphorism teachers sometimes go to: “I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”So much of what informs our politics is whether we understand what certain things are like.Not whether we know they happen, but whether we understand what it’sliketo experience them; to be properly sick, poor, afraid, confronted with change we can’t control, in a war, out of money, working manually, in a long strike, aspirational, safe, full, fed. We spend a lot of time dissecting politics in terms of beliefs – thewhat– but I think a neglected part of our political differences is whether we know how these things feel.It sounds as though that’s part of what you think they don’t understand; what it’sliketo really be down, out, or both. And the trouble with that sort of knowledge is you can’t get it from someone telling you. Having someone describe these things to you is not the same as actually experiencing them yourself. “I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”That’s not necessarily a barrier to mutual respect, as long as we knowwhatwe don’t know. But maybe that’s the problem: they don’t know how much knowledge they’re missing.Another thing teachers sometimes go to is that you have to experience your own incompetence to be motivated to correct it. You have to be unable to solve the maths problem; unable to build the carton that will keep the egg safe. You have to be confronted with the fact that you cannot produce an answer. Is there anything you could do to show them the depths of what they don’t know; any question where they’d be unable to produceanyanswer, not even a wrong one? Could you show more of “what it’s like” – the knowledge you have and they don’t? Tell them about things you’ve seen, things people you know have seen? I was thinking of this during recent commemorations of HIV/Aids: how many of us know what it’sliketo go to 40 funerals in a year, or how to convince a hospital to let you in when they don’t allow same-sex partners? What might the equivalent “what it’s like” be for the vulnerabilities you want them to understand?At a minimum, those explanations ofwhyyou see things the way you do might help them treat your experience as credentials rather than fuzzy-mindedness.You don’t want to interact with each other just like generational stereotypes: “You kids you haven’t seen anything”, “You oldies are living in memory.” And you can’t give them your experience, or anyone else’s. But you can help them stop seeing their own lives as a complete political theory.The reader’s letter has been edited for lengthAsk Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleLeading questionsFamilyGrandparents and grandparentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So what’s the attraction?Thu 18 Dec 2025 08.35 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 12.35 ESTShareGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of theNorthern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of theBritish Museumand taken on roles includingadvising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.But Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has becomethe latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announcedwith a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.The tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.The initiative Osborne is heading up,OpenAIfor Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.Osborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Cleggblazed the trail as head of global affairsfor Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists(€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.1:46'The most disruptive force in history': Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk discuss the future of AI – videoThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year,Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened theAI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.You can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.Either way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.It’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.The more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.Chris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite AppExplore more on these topicsGeorge OsborneOpinionOpenAIChatGPTComputingArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

She reflects on her critically acclaimed debut and how she’s learning to reclaim and relinquish controlLaura SnapesThu 18 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTShareNo one in pop has had a year likeAddison Rae. She may not be the biggest star – that remains Taylor Swift – or even the most commercially successful breakout act. But the dreamy dance-pop haze of her debut album, Addison, made her into an artist’s artist, loved by the likes of Charli xcx and Lana Del Rey – the leftfield pop acts who paved the way for someone like her. Like a pre-Brat Charli, or perhaps Sky Ferreira, the 25-year-old is the pop connoisseur’s choice, justly earning comparisons to Del Rey, her fellow Louisiana girl Britney Spears and Ray of Light-era Madonna, while knowing her way around her R&B and Jersey club. She’s up for best new artist at next year’s Grammy awards – and with Addison and its knowingly anaesthetised single Headphones On placing in the Guardian’s top five albums and tracks of 2025 respectively, she’s our artist of the year.So it’s crazy to flick back just two years to when Rae wasn’t just a flop, but a punchline. In 2023, she released her debut single Obsessed, a perfectly average Benny Blanco-produced single that attracted disproportionate hatred because Rae was then just a TikTok star whose breezy dance videos had made her the platform’s fifth most-followed figure. The song flopped. Five months later came the AR EP: featuring a Charli guest verse – she asked to feature on a leaked demo that she loved – it made Rae a cult favourite. Last summer, she returned the favour, guesting on a remix of Charli’s Von Dutch: “While you’re sitting in your dad’s basement … Got a lot to say about my debut!” Rae taunted.Now, she says, she’s relieved Obsessed didn’t work out. “I wasn’t ready to stand in front of people and say what I say as concisely and straightforwardly as I am now. I’ve grown up so much in the past few years. Life happens to you at such a quick rate once you start realising how in the driver’s seat you actually are.”View image in fullscreenAddison Rae performing New York, 3 October 2025.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty ImagesShe also has a compelling theory about why it took her a while to get here: earlier this year, she smartly posited that “taste is a luxury” – that when you’re trying to escape your circumstances, as the Lafayette girl born Addison Rae Easterling was, you’ll do whatever it takes to get out, rather than wait around for people to understand your truest self. (A playlist she made in 2021 featured tATu, the Cars and Sophie.) Hence dancing “in a way that the most people possible could understand” – the hypnotic, semaphore-like portrait mode style that TikTok made indelible. As soon as she got a talent manager, she asked to train in songwriting and acting. “I used social media as a way to get more stability, to have the opportunity to actually pursue the things that I want,” she says.Released in June, Addison tracks the velocity of her six-year rise from dropout journalism student to first-gen TikTok superstar and mononymous icon: “My life moves faster than me / Can’t feel the ground beneath my feet,” she gasps on the trancey Times Like These. That speed has only intensified: it’s early December and Rae is calling from her Los Angeles home. She’s sometimes endearingly garrulous, but also sits in the Venn crossover where southern charm meets expensive media training. Her publicist and two managers are on mute, and she keeps her camera off. “I just look a little insane,” she says. “I’m so discombobulated. I got back from Sweden a day and a half ago and I’m just like, wrecked. I got my hair done – oh my gosh, my roots – then I had the Variety thing and a shoot.”The “Variety thing” was the magazine’s annual Hitmakers Brunch, where Rae and her producers and co-writers, Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser of Max Martin’s Stockholm-based MXM stable, received the Future is Female award. Having three women in charge of a major-label pop album is basically unprecedented:a 2025 reportfound that a pitiful 5.9% of production credits belonged to women, down from 6.5% in 2023. “Luka and Elvira are two of the most incredibly talented women, in their 20s, in a space full of men,” Rae says. “As much as they’ve told me they feel like I took a chance on them, I feel like they took a chance on me. I can’t believe we made the album with just the three of us in a room. I try to downplay it, because I never want to force that idea into people’s faces. But I really feel like it is something so special.”View image in fullscreenLuka Kloser and Addison Rae onstage at the Variety Hitmakers Brunch, 6 December 2025.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesThey wrote last year’s breakout single Diet Pepsi – think falsetto Lana, synths hissing like hot springs – the first day they met. Traditionally, aspiring female stars have been shoved in writing rooms filled with strangers. Writing the song, says Rae, “would never have happened had it not felt like such an accepting and safe space. That sometimes can’t be achieved when there’s an influx of people in the room that you don’t know, or maybe feel intimidated by or uncomfortable with.”Famously, Rae went into her first meeting with Columbia Records with a folder containing her vision for her debut album – and not a note of music. You must be good at selling yourself, I tell her, and she laughs. She’s flicking through the folder as we speak, and says its contents ended up being “shockingly present” on the album. “I had photos of myself when I was little in pageants; one of me as a little girl of one year old, but I have a crown on. I always want to go back to this childlike inspiration and fulfil those dreams and goals and ideas.”Recent pop lyrics have been heavily laden with lore and thinly veiled swipes at rivals, making the direct writing on Addison unusually refreshing. Rae sings of luxury, pleasure, fashion and fame keeping sadness at bay. You might call it superficial, but her unapologetic mindset reflects how many people her age feel when short-term highs can mollify a dire lack of long-term security. She also knows how voyeuristically appealing glamour is: “You got a front row seat and I / I got a taste of the glamorous life,” she sings on Fame Is a Gun.“I am a very protective person when it comes to my life, and I don’t like it when people take things out of context,” she says of her straightforward style. “I want to write in a way that is direct and honest and clear, and leaves little room for misinterpretation, because I just don’t believe that my story or the things I want to say deserve to be treated that way.”Addison Rae: Diet Pepsi – videoI read her something that the Washington Post wrote when they named Addison album of the year: “Why does this woman sound so alone?” “That is so interesting, I actually want to see that,” she says, typing in the newspaper’s URL before being surprised to hit the paywall: “I thought I was totally paying for that!” She gets why listeners would interpret it that way. “The album was [from] a very lonely perspective. I wanted to say it on my own and to communicate in a way that felt like I was speaking for myself. Life is lonely, and there’s something really powerful about taking that into your own hands.” That’s one of the most captivating aspects of the record, I suggest: the steeliness of her self-reliant perspective versus the enveloping softness of its sound. “That means a lot,” she says. “I am an introspective person and I love to look inside and understand why I feel the way I do. I think that is being alone in a very beautiful way, in a way that honours the stories I want to tell and the way I want to tell them.”It’s immediately clear when you get Addison on something she’s less keen to share. She’s fairly guarded when I ask about whether being a sexual person, as she recently described herself, was challenging when she attended religious schools in Louisiana, or if she had to unlearn anything she was taught there. “I was never someone who was necessarily a rule follower,” she says. “If anything, staying in line was more of a way to avoid conflict.” She talks at slightly filibustering length about always wanting to understand why different people had different beliefs, and credits moving to California with showing her “so many ways of experiencing life that I was not questioning or I was so unaware of when I was living back home”.From awol to A-lister: how pop stars from Charli xcx to Addison Rae found the fun in fame againRead moreHaving control over her expression is one reason Rae thought touring wasn’t for her. Until her own debut tour this year, she had made only guest live appearances, including withCharli xcx(“she taught me so much and believed in me”) – and experimental producer Arca, who remixed her heady song Aquamarine. In July, she supported and guested with Lana Del Rey over two nights at Wembley. Their duet on Diet Pepsi provoked total delirium. “It was really, really insane,” she says. Performing the song alone on the second date, she realised she was doing “something that I love very fearlessly – not carelessly, but freely. I really felt that click. As planned and perfect as you want everything to be, there’s something so magical about surrendering.”Rae’s own tour started in Ireland in August, to wild acclaim. Her staging was inspired by Alice in Wonderland and the Wizard of Oz, “this essence of unfamiliarity”, she says – though the abs-out choreo was pure Slave 4 U Britney and the million dollar bills with her face on, shot from confetti canons, very Richard Prince. (“It is deeply fun stuff,”wrotethe Guardian’s Daniel Dylan Wray.) She could have sold out much bigger rooms. “I wanted to give myself grace and patience in finding what my purpose is on the stage,” she says, though she was unnerved by these smaller theatre venues not having big screens – another curatorial tool. Without them, fans were “really forced to look at the stage and every single moment, which I thought was very vulnerable”. It turned out she loved it. “You could see every transition, every breath. It even further takes away this sense of control, forcing myself to face the uncomfortability of that.”View image in fullscreenAddison Rae performing with Arca at Coachella, 13 April 2025.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for CoachellaIt’s both surprising and understandable to hear how much Rae obsesses over control. Her appeal comes from her unaffected, sweetly giddy persona: during her Variety awards speech, she appeared genuinely breathless with excitement. She is also one of several pop stars who has put the fun back in fame after several years of musicians stressing how painful it is, the newly minted insider making a gasp-face at the thrill of it all on the red carpet. She treats celebrity as part of her craft and is open about craving it: “Have you ever dreamt of being seen? / Not by someone, more like in a magazine,” she sings on High Fashion (winningly, also the song she has listened to the most this year). “I enjoy fame,” she says plainly. “I think fame is very exposing and raw, and it puts you in a position that not everyone gets to experience. I enjoy the luxury of it all, though of course there is a price you pay.”That price is becoming an object of wild speculation. Her TikTok success led her to join the Hype House, an LA mansion where she and other platform stars, includingOrdinary singer Alex Warren, lived and made content – and spawned endless gossip. Her parents, twice married and twice divorced from each other, became social media personalities and generated a lot of messy headlines. (“Wish my mom and dad could’ve been in love,” she sings on Headphones On, a rare moment of vulnerability.) Footage of her introducing herself to Donald Trump at a UFC fight in 2021 attracted allegations that she was a supporter, which she denied (she spoke out in support of immigrants during heightened ICE raids this summer). There is a lot of crazy commentary about her online, and finding her feet as a pop star has been an exercise in reclaiming and relinquishing control. “There’s a very magical space in between those two things that you can always strive to accomplish,” she says.The 50 best albums of 2025: No 4 – Addison Rae: AddisonRead moreRae’s new year’s resolution, she says, “is to share less. I’ve actually been thinking about this so much. No one needs to know anything!” She laughs. “Obviously I love to talk and to share, and I’ve done a great deal of that on this call already, but I think the less you share, the more in control you are.” As for the rest of 2026, although she just got back from writing in Sweden, there’s no immediate plan to follow up Addison. “When something’s ready and done, I want to put it out as soon as possible,” she says.Going back to her maxim about taste as a luxury, this year she found a fanbase ecstatic at the prospect of a pop star who loves both Britney and Burial. She knows she can go further next time. “I trust that the people who indulge in my artistry treat it with kindness and acceptance and love and understanding, in a way that maybe I didn’t before,” she says. Other people won’t, she adds, “and that’s honestly the dream, that I’m never fully understood. If that ever were to change, I think it would be quite boring actually.”"

For good measure, he also won the European Order of Merit too.Rory McIlroy named BBC Sports Personality of the Year after Masters and Ryder Cup heroics – liveRead more“2025 has been the year that I made my dreams come true, from Augusta to the Ryder Cup and everywhere else in between,” McIlroy said. “It has really been the year that dreams are made of. Thank you for voting for me as your sports personality of the year.”The England rugby star Ellie Kildunne was a surprise second, a just reward for her totemic role inthe Red Roses’ Women’s Rugby World Cup victory, whilethe Formula One world champion, Lando Norris, was third.There was more success for golf as Europe’s Ryder Cup players were named team of the year, after surviving a thriller at Bethpage Black in September. But this was McIlroy’s night as he became only the third golfer, after Dai Rees in 1957 and Nick Faldo in 1989, to claim the award.View image in fullscreenEngland’s World Cup-winning rugby star Ellie Kildunne was a surprise second.Photograph: David Davies/PAThe Northern Irishman had made the podium twice before in 2014 and 2023, and had admitted recently that if he did not win this year he was never going to win it. This time, though, nothing could stop him.It was his Masters triumph, most of all, that sealed the deal. McIlroy had not claimed a major in 11 years and had repeatedly tried and failed to become only the sixth man in history to win the career grand slam. But roared on by an army of supporters at Augusta, he finally joined Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen in the pantheon.“I didn’t make it easy on myself,” McIlroy admitted. “When you want something so much, the obstacle becomes yourself. I’ve had my chances at Augusta, I’ve been trying for 15 years, and the heartbreaks, the way it finished, made it even sweeter.“My family, my mum and dad, have sacrificed so much for me. I obviously wouldn’t be here without them. So if you’re watching, thank you. My wife, Erica, my daughter, Poppy, they are what holds me together. They are my rock.”View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman was named coach of the year for the second time after the Lionesses’ success at the Euros.Photograph: David Davies/PAFor the first time in the show’s 71-year history, viewers were told 25 minutes before the end who was in the top three in the voting, and there were gasps as Kildunne was announced first, followed by McIlroy and Norris. It meant that the darts world champion, Luke Littler, along with the Lionesses Chloe Kelly and Hannah Hampton, were out.The joint inclusion of Kelly and Hampton on the six-strong shortlist surely split the women’s football vote. However, the England team were rewarded for their Women’s Euros triumph in the summer as their manager,Sarina Wiegman, was named coach of the year for the second time.There was also more repeat success for the Swedish pole vaulter Mondo Duplantis, who was voted the world sports star of the year for the second year in succession, after breaking three world records and winning the world championships.Elsewhere, the young sports personality of the year was awarded to the 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang, who made a huge impact off the bench as the Lionesses won in Switzerland, while the former Arsenal and France striker Thierry Henry was given the lifetime achievement award by his four children.View image in fullscreenThe Swedish pole vaulter Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis won the world sports star award for the second successive year.Photograph: David Davies/PABut the night’s most powerful moment came when two of the fathers whose daughters were killed in a dance class in Southport were given the Helen Rollason award for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity.Elsie Dot Stancombe, aged seven, Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, and Bebe King, six, died at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop in July 2024.Elsie’s dad, David, and Alice’s father, Sergio, ran this year’s London Marathon to establish lasting legacies in their daughters’ names through three projects in their honour.“I’m just a dad keeping a promise to a little girl,” David told the audience. “Elsie wanted me to run the London Marathon and I did. It gave me a massive focus on the hardest times I have ever been through.”Sergio then dedicated the award to his wife and “my princess Alice – keep dancing and spreading magic”.It was a moment that moved everyone in attendance – including McIlroy. “Being a father of a little girl, seeing the two gentlemen up there, they are heroes,” he told the audience. “It makes the good moments even more special.”Like the rest of his 2025, whether on the fairways or on the podium, McIlroy’s words were pitch perfect.Explore more on these topicsBBC Sports Personality of the YearRory McIlroyLando NorrisSarina WiegmanGolfRyder Cup 2025Formula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

It will focus on prevention and tackling harmful behaviours in boys, by teaching pupils about healthy relationships and pornography and equipping teachers with the skills to intervene if they witness disturbing or worrying behaviour.Presenting the strategy in the House of Commons on Thursday,Jess Phillips, the safeguarding minister, who has played a central role in developing the policies, said the strategy was backed by £1bn of funding and was “more than a document”.“It is a call from a government that recognises this as a national emergency, a government that is willing to back up its words with action,” she said. “Ending violence against women and girls is the work of us all … It will take all of society to step up and end the epidemic of abuse and violence that shames our country.”Boys to learn difference between porn and real life to tackle misogyny in England’s schoolsRead moreThe document spells out cross-governmental plans to address VAWG by focusing on prevention and measures such assending experts to secondary schoolsto educate children about consent and the dangers of sharing explicit images. Teachers will also be able to send young people at risk of causing harm on behavioural courses.Phillips said that as well as prevention, new measures would “bear down” on perpetrators and support victims so they could “get justice when they seek it, and the closure that they deserve”.Andrea Simon, the director of the End Violence AgainstWomencoalition, said the strategy was welcome but that the £3m allocated to a teacher training pilot would “barely touch the surface of the additional infrastructure needed”.She said many organisations that support abused women were facing a funding crisis, which the strategy was promising little to help. “This is an important milestone but we remain deeply concerned about financial challenges for frontline support services following years of chronic underfunding. The delays to this strategy’s publication have only made this worse,” she said.Policies in the heavily trailed packages include:Tackling misogyny withfocused education in schools.A newGP referral serviceand £50m funding for therapeutic support for child victims of sexual abuse.New laws to ban AI “nudification” apps.Plans to work with tech companies to ban the sharing of nude images on children’s phones.Specialistrape and sexual offences unitsin every police force.A national rollout ofstrict new restraining orders on domestic abusers.£19m funding for councils to provide safe housing for domestic abuse survivors.£550m investmentto support victims and witnesses throughout the criminal justice system.One aspect of the strategy which has drawn criticism from the Conservatives is its focus on tackling misogyny among boys. Simon said the focus on early intervention must not target or demonise individual boys. “We don’t want a situation that is overly punitive around very young boys,” she said.“Young people need education and awareness-raising, but we have to recognise that the problem is systemic and those profiting the most from rising extreme misogyny are the tech platforms who must be held to account.”The domestic abuse commissioner forEnglandand Wales also raised concerns about the level of funding for services. “Today’s strategy rightly recognises the scale of this challenge and the need to address the misogynistic attitudes that underpin it, but the level of investment to achieve this falls seriously short,” Nicole Jacobs said. “There is still no long-term sustainable funding for specialist services to ensure victims can actually access support in their area, despite the fact many of these measures will likely drive up referrals.”One source in the sector said that despite multiple briefings which revealed much of the policies in the strategy before its release, the strategy remained unclear. “I think there is quite a lot of disappointment,” they said. “It’s all very kind of top level and vague. All of the initiatives do nothing to alleviate the enormous strain on frontline services. The announcements are actually an investment into education and health, not into the sector.”Karen Ingala Smith, co-founder of the Femicide Census, which records the killings of women by men in the UK, welcomed the strategy’s explicit use of the term. “Femicide is arguably the most serious form of men’s violence against women and girls,” she said.The Conservatives faced criticism after their leader, Kemi Badenoch, wasaccused of weaponising violence against women and girlsand of using “dangerous” and “deeply inaccurate” claims in her response to the government’s plan.Badenoch said plans totackle misogyny in schoolswere being introduced only because “some people in Labour” watched the Netflix drama Adolescence, adding that the focus should be on “people, who come from cultures that don’t respect women, coming into our country”.She added: “The fact is, it’s not 11-year-old boys in school who are perpetrating violence against women and girls … They need to do the right thing, put police officers on the street, stop people who come from cultures that don’t respect women coming into our country, foreign criminals removed as soon as they commit crimes.”Ghadah Alnasseri, the co-executive director at Imkaan, a charity that supports women from minority ethnic backgrounds, said the response could put women at risk. “Her rhetoric is very dangerous,” Alnasseri said, adding that the majority of victims of sexual and domestic abuse knew their abuser. “It’s deeply inaccurate, it’s misinformation and it’s spreading racism.”Explore more on these topicsViolence against women and girlsRape and sexual assaultWomenSchoolsDeepfakeEnglandJess PhillipsnewsShareReuse this content"

She has only intervened publicly on policy issues close to her heart,such as workers’ rights, on which she warned the government not to “blink or buckle” on the bill.Oftenconsidered a potential successorto Keir Starmer, she declined to rule out running for the leadership or returning to frontline politics in her first public comments after stepping down, saying she had “not gone away”. Speculation about her ambitions has continued.Earlier this month, Starmer said she was “hugely talented” and he wouldbring her back to the cabinet, while her allies have said she left her role as housing secretary with a much clearer view of how to implement Labour values in government and would be keen to return to do more.However, they cautioned that she was significantly shaken by the impact on her family of the stamp duty row, and she has yet to hear from HMRC about settling the debt. They said those were key factors in whether she would run in any contest, and they denied she was plotting an imminent challenge.After a bidding war between several different publishers, the memoir will be released by The Bodley Head, an imprint of Vintage, a division of Penguin Random House UK. Rayner is yet to settle on a title, with a few options said to be under consideration.Unlike several other notable politicians – including Tony Blair and Wes Streeting, the health secretary, who is also regarded as having his eye on the top job – she will use a ghostwriter to capture her plain-speaking style on the page. She will read the audiobook version herself.Sources said Rayner wanted the book to inspire and encourage others to overcome adversity. A friend said: “There’s been huge interest from publishers. This won’t be your standard politician’s memoir. It will be authentically Angela and in her own voice.”Alice Skinner, the editorial director at The Bodley Head, who acquired the memoir, said: “We are so delighted and proud to be publishing Angela Rayner. Her book will be unvarnished and upfront – you can expect her authenticity to shine through – and an empowering vision for a fairer, kinder society that will enable everyone to flourish. It will spark change, one reader at a time.”Starmer, already rocked by leadership speculation in recent months, is approaching a perilous moment at next year’s May elections when Labour is expected to face a disastrous set of results across the country, which would inevitably raise questions about his future.Before her resignation, Rayner was regarded as the frontrunner to succeed him. Streeting, Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, and Andy Burnham, the mayor of greater Manchester, are among the names considered likely to run.In recent weeks, Downing Street has gone to great efforts to shore up the prime minister, including withan operation last monththat went badly wrong when allies appeared to confirm he was vulnerable to a leadership challenge immediately after the budget.No 10 has since tried other tactics to counter the leadership speculation – with the quiet but dogged work of the new political secretary, Amy Richards, to get Starmer to spend much more time with his own MPs, appearing among the most effective.Over the last few days, as Labour MPs prepared to head home from Westminster for the Christmas recess, speculation on how the prime minister might be ousted, and who by,has briefly intensified. But with MPs now back in their constituencies, Downing Street will be hoping it dies down, giving Starmer much-needed breathing space.Explore more on these topicsAngela RaynerLabour party leadershipLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The United Kingdom and United States have a very special relationship, and Christian’s extensive experience as an outstanding diplomat will support this uniquely close bond and ensure it continues to flourish.“I warmly congratulate him as he starts his work to further build our strong economic and security ties and deliver for the British people.”Turner, who had not yet taken up the UN role, said: “I am honoured to be nominated to serve as the UK’s ambassador to the USA. Our two countries share an historic partnership rooted in common values, shared security and deep economic ties.“At a pivotal time for the transatlantic relationship, I look forward to working with President Trump’s administration, and leaders in Congress, business and society to strengthen that bond in the years ahead.”Turner previously served as the UK’s high commissioner to Pakistan and was first secretary in the British embassy under Tony Blair. He is understood to have been in the running for the role of Foreign Office permanent secretary but lost out to Robbins in January.The US ambassador role has been vacant since Mandelson was sacked in September for failing to disclose the extent of his ties with the child sex offender Epstein.Mandelson was found to have urged the financier to “fight for early release” from jail in 2008 as he faced an 18-month sentence for procuring a child for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyPeter MandelsonnewsShareReuse this content"

It is not meant to break bodies or silence dissent.“Yet we are witnessing conditions so severe that these young people feel driven to risk death simply to be heard.”Campbell said the allegation “couldn’t be further from the truth”.Dr James Smith, a qualified emergency physician who is a lecturer at University College London, told a press conference on Thursday that some of the prisoners on hunger strikes were dying.A group of 51 MPs and peers wrote to the justice secretary, David Lammy, urging him to meet the lawyers of the eight prisoners.Jeremy Corbyn, the independent MP and former Labour leader, told the Commons the group had not been given a “substantive reply from the Ministry of Justice”.He said: “I would hope that in hearing this debate, they will recognise they have a responsibility for the welfare, the medical condition and the way in which prisoners are supported in every one of our prisons, that includes people who are taking protest action.”Campbell said: “The welfare and the wellbeing of prisoners, whether they’re on hunger strike or not, are absolutely central to the prison service and to ministers’ minds. And it is really important that we appreciate that the deputy prime minister does take a keen interest in what is happening and hope that we can find a suitable outcome for this.“And I also have to say very gently, it couldn’t be further from the truth for anyone in this House or indeed outside to suggest that somehow the government or the prison service is trying to ‘break the bodies’ of the people that are on hunger strike.“We want to find a settlement to this and I give a commitment to take back to the deputy prime minister what has been said here today and hopefully we can find a suitable way forward.”The prisons minister, Lord Timpson, said: “We are very experienced at dealing with hunger strikes. Unfortunately, over the last five years we have averaged over 200 hunger strike incidents every year and the processes that we have are well-established and they work very well – with prisons working alongside our NHS partners every day, making sure our systems are robust and working – and they are.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The latter closed a few months later, but Napier, accommodating about 400 people, weathered multiple storms. Approximately 200 men, half of those accommodated on the site at the time, were infected in amass Covid outbreak. Then there were far-right protests, fires, hunger strikes and adamning high court rulingthat found it failed to meet minimum standards. At one point Kent county council was so concerned about conditions for the men accommodated there it launched a safeguarding inquiry.Initially, asylum seekers were accommodated there for an indefinite period but theHome Officesubsequently introduced a 90-day limit, which the men held there said made their time there more bearable.Sally Hough, who ran the Napier drop-in centre, which provided advice and support for asylum seekers at Napier, said: “The closure of the camp is a day of very mixed emotions for everyone who has been involved in supporting the residents. For all of us, it has been completely life-changing in a positive way. However, the camp itself, the buildings, the shambolic management, have left their mark on those that stayed there.”She said things were particularly chaotic in the early months with no drinking water and furniture salvaged from old stable blocks. The men slept in dormitories and some slept outside the barracks in sub-zero temperatures due to fears of becoming infected with Covid if they slept inside close to others. After the high court ruling there was a brief emptying of the barracks while the walls were repainted. But it reopened within days.“Folkestone is a special place and the fact that former residents return to visit us from far flung places of the UK is testament to that. It became a vital safe space for the men to go outside of the camp, seek advice and see a friendly face in the community,” Hough said. “Just the other day some of the men were volunteering with clearing and controlled burning of scrubland so that the flowers will come back in spring. What a wonderful thing to leave behind for the community.”Charlotte Khan, the head of advocacy and public affairs at the charity Care4Calais, said: “We’ve supported people at Napier barracks since it opened and we can’t shy away from the trauma it has inflicted upon many, particularly in its early days.“Our volunteers have done an incredible job supporting the people in the barracks, but we are pleased to see it closing. Frankly, former military sites are not suitable accommodation for refugees who have fled war, torture and persecution. They are retraumatising, and harm people’s health and wellbeing.“People want, and should, be accommodated in communities, not camps. That should be the final lesson the government takes from Napier.”AHome Officespokesperson said: “We are furious at the level of illegal migrants and asylum hotels. This government will close every asylum hotel. Work is well under way, with more suitable sites being brought forward to ease pressure on communities and cut asylum costs. We are working closely with local authorities, property partners and across government so that we can accelerate delivery.”The site will be handed back to the Ministry of Defence by the Home Office in January 2026 and will be redeveloped by Taylor Wimpey as houses and flats.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumKentHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

At the newly installed battery “marriage station”, lifting machines push the most crucial component up into the body. Robots fit and tighten 16 bolts in under a minute – quick enough to ensure the constant flow of vehicles around Britain’s biggest car factory.The electric cars in question are thethird generation of Nissan’s Leaf, after the Japanese carmaker this week launched production following £450m of upgrades.Beside the brightly lit final-inspection line, the industry minister Chris McDonald hailed the investment as an important part of the UK industry’s transition to electric vehicles. The Leaf remains – for now – the only electric car to be built in large volumes in Britain.However, the launch does not come at an auspicious moment for electric cars. Carmakers around the world have delayed models, complaining that sales have not grown as fast as expected.On the same day as the Leaf’s launch, theEU announced it would water down a 2035 banon petrol and diesel cars, proposing instead to allow 10% of European car sales to have internal combustion engines after that point.Nissan has joined the retreat. Just two years ago it had pledged to sell only electric cars in Europe by 2030. However, Nissan’s boss in Europe, Massimiliano Messina, said in Sunderland that he was unwilling to commit to a date for the transition to be completed.View image in fullscreenMassimiliano Messina, Nissan’s boss in Europe, speaks to mark the launch of the third-generation Leaf as the first vehicles roll off the production line.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“If I might give a number, it will be wrong,” he said, when asked when Nissan would be all-electric in Europe. “I cannot give you a date by when. But I’m more confident that we talk about 2050.”The EU, a key market for the cars from Sunderland, was the last domino to fall in a global move to slow the transition, after a global barrage of lobbying by the politically powerful car industry. The UK weakened its zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate in April – and willexamine further changes. Canada paused its EV sales mandate in September.Meanwhile, Donald Trump has torn up any policy with a hint of support for electric vehicles – despite his short-lived alliance with Tesla’s boss, Elon Musk. That hascost US carmakers including Fordand General Motors billions of dollars in abandoned investments and lost sales.European and British manufacturers will still have to switch to electric sales, but carmakers including Volkswagen have expressed relief at the EU’s changes. That will give them greater leeway to sell more hybrids, which combine a smaller battery with a polluting petrol engine.UK government plays down reports of plan to bring EV sales target review forwardRead moreElectric-focused carmakers have strongly opposed the changes, and some in the EV industry have argued that it will just leave the way clear for manufacturers fromChina, the rising EV manufacturing superpower.Part of the Sunderland investment was to make sure it could sell more hybrids if needed. The new Leaf cars are now being manufactured on the same kilometre-long line that builds hybrid Qashqai and Juke models.“We’ve future-proofed for the transition to fully electric vehicles – when the time comes,” said Guy Reid, the engineering general manager at Sunderland, on a platform overlooking the battery conveyor belt. “When we introduce more electric vehicles, we don’t have to modify this facility again.”Each station completes 60 jobs an hour in order to be able to make up to 600,000 cars a year. However, in 2024 the plant made only 282,000 cars, down 14% from the year before.The batteries themselves are manufactured next door, in anew plant built by the Chinese-owned companyAutomotive Energy Supply Corporation(AESC). As the new Leaf was launched, high-precision robotic arms stamped and trimmed battery cells to be assembled into packs, although only one out of four lines was operational as it waited for demand from Nissan to increase.View image in fullscreenA new AESC gigafactory, built next door to the Nissan plant, makes batteries for the cars.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAESC has also had to scale back its ambitions for Sunderland. Its new battery factory is capable of making 15.8 gigawatt hours (GWh) of batteries a year, enough for about 300,000 electric cars, butwell short of initial plans for 38GWh.Nissan’s change in direction is not just following the global automotive mood. It is in the middle of a third turnaround plan after years of leadership turmoil.The company’s former chief executive Carlos Ghosn tried to make an alliance of France’s Renault, Nissan and Japan’s Mitsubishi into the world’s biggest carmaker. However, he was arrested in 2018.He dramatically fled house arrest, leaving behind years of leadership chaos at Nissan, and an abandonment of world-spanning ambitions.Nevertheless, in 2023 Makoto Uchida, one of Ghosn’s successors, had enough confidence to pledge only electric sales in Europe by 2030. Hesaid: “Nissan will make the switch to full electric by 2030 in Europe – we believe it is the right thing to do for our business, our customers and for the planet.”Sunderland was a key part of that plan. Nissan also said that year it wasconsidering three electric models: a new Leaf hatchback, plus replacements for the Juke and Qashqai crossover SUVs (although the latter has yet to be confirmed).Securing the new electric models in Sunderland was seen as a huge priority for the previous Conservative government – partly to avoid a rerun of 2016, when the plant became a symbol of the potential economic harms of Brexit. The government secretly agreed to givestate aid worth £61m.Brexit is no longer the main concern of the car industry, but carmakers are still able to win significant support.View image in fullscreenWorkers at the plant inspect a freshly completed Leaf as it comes off the production line.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianState aid disclosures show that Boris Johnson’s government in 2022 gave Nissan £101m towards the plant in direct grants for a “new all-electric vehicle”, one of the largest subsidies given to a manufacturer since the UK’s departure from the EU. Nissan said it had invested £450m itself in upgrading the plant.Johnson’s government said the grant was justified because it “secures a strategically important internationally mobile investment”. Carmakers often play different governments off against each other when seeking support for factories.The support may have helped Sunderland avoid the axe when Uchida was forced out earlier this year. In May, Nissan’s current chief executive, Ivan Espinosa, announced theclosure of seven factories, with the loss of 20,000 jobs– but spared the UK.Yet Nissan still faces questions over whether it can fill the plant again. One suggestion aired by Espinosa wasto build cars for Dongfeng, a Chinese manufacturerand partner in a joint venture with Nissan in Wuhan, China.Messina said Nissan was still looking at “opportunities”, but added that there was “nothing concrete”. He insisted the company’s main focus would be on winning back market share with new models, starting with the Leaf.“For the time being, we are looking at ourselves because we want to make sure we secure our own footprint with our vehicles,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNissanElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsAutomotive industryTravel and transportMotoringGreenhouse gas emissionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But how can I take care of my face?Enter what I call ‘no-skincare skincare’ – things that support the skin without disturbing itJessica DeFinoThu 18 Dec 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 12.01 ESTShareHi Ugly,I used to love skincare, but after reading your articles and noticing how many useless products get produced, I lost faith in it.But since I believe that virtue lies in the middle, I would like to keep taking care of my skin. What are the most effective things one can do without buying lots of stuff?– Losing Faith, Seeking SkincareFaith. Virtue. Skincare. One of these things is not like the others.I can’t fault you for talking about toner in vaguely religious terms. Beauty culture is hellbenton assigning spiritual significance to skincare. “Holy Grail” products and “miracle” ingredients. Retailers named Mecca and Oh My Cream. Brands called Monastery, Soulcare and Dieux Skin – the latter manufactures Deliverance Serum and Baptism Cleanser, publishes “Skin Bibles” and refers to its customers as a “congregation”. Corporations absolve “skin sins.” “Cult-favorite” moisturizers promise aesthetic immortalityvia blood sacrifice.Why does BigBeautydemand faith from its followers? To borrow from Corinthians, faith is belief without evidence – and actually, evidence shows the skincare industry needs your skin more than your skin needs it.I and others have reported about this over and over again: skin ispretty much self-sufficient. Too many topicals canstress out your skin; the “science of skincare”isn’t science or care.Many productsare making your skin worse, as is yourantiaging routine.Add the industry’s environmental toll, and losing faith in billions of petrochemical-filled plastic bottles is only logical.More from Jessica DeFino:Why is this column called ‘Ask Ugly’?How should I be styling my pubic hair?How do I deal with imperfection?My father had plastic surgery. Now he wants me and my mother to get work doneI want to ignore beauty culture. But I’ll never get anywhere if I don’t look a certain wayAs for “virtue”, I wince at the word, but I agree in principle. Thereisa reasonable middle ground between caring for your skin and buying skincare products.To find it, define your terms. What do you mean by an “effective” routine?According to industry orthodoxy, an effective line-up alters the skin’s appearance to better match the standard of beauty: glazed like a donut and taut as a twenty-something’s, forever and ever, amen. It creates and satisfies consumerwants.I think what you’re asking for – and what I recommend – is a regimen that effectively supports the skin’s functions and satisfies itsneeds.Skin protects. It’s part of the immune system. It defends against UV rays, pollution, pathogens, irritants and allergens. It stores fat and water. It regulates body temperature. It houses one trillion microorganisms – the skin microbiome – which deposit some of the industry’s buzziest ingredients (peptides, ceramides, antioxidants) directly onto your face. Skin alsoself-cleanses, self-moisturizes, self-exfoliates and self-heals.For a full account of this, read James Hamblin’sClean: The New Science of Skinand Salmah Harharah’sThe Empowered Skincare Revolution. (Harharah does invoke “divine” skin design – you can’t escape the religious connotations!)All these processes depend on a strong barrier and biome, and lots of topical products weaken both,studiesshow. This can trigger acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, dermatitis, dryness, oiliness, dehydration and even premature “aging”.Other factors affect the skin’s ability to function optimally, too: genetics, environment, diet, lifestyle, stress, lack of sleep. And as with any other organ, it sometimes needs a little help counteracting these factors.Enter what I call “no-skincare skincare” – things that support the skin without disturbing it.Salmon is packed with the essential fatty acids thatmake up the skin barrier, so eating it for dinner qualifies as no-skincare skincare. Exerciseincreases antioxidant activityandsweating helps clear out pores, so going for a jog counts, too. Time outdoors diversifies the microbiome.Meditationstrengthens the barrier. Sleep encourages cellular turnover. A humidifier prevents moisture loss. Vitamin C builds collagen.If that doesn’t seem like much of a beauty routine, you’re right. “The ecosystem does not need to be maintained in any elaborate way that we didn’t already know made our skin look good: sleeping and eating well, minimizing anxiety and spending time in nature,” Hamblin writes in Clean.I don’t mean to demonizealltopical products, though. Some truly are necessary! Sunscreen, for one, since overexposure to sunlight damages the skin barrier and raises skin cancer risk. You’ll likely need a gentle cleanser to remove SPF before bed, and moisturizer if your skin runs dry. For persistent issues – rashes, cystic acne – see a dermatologist. Everything else is extra.I can’t recommend a personalized routine without knowing your specific concerns, but here’s what I do as someone with an extra-sensitive epidermis (thanks totopical steroids gone wrong) and chronic dryness (a lingering side-effect of Accutane) to keep my skin fine and functional if not flawless (reminder: flawlessness is a beauty standard, not a measure of health).I prioritize sleep when I can and carve out 10 minutes a day for meditation and deep breathing. I’m big on facial massage with my fingers – no, it’s not “nature’s Botox”, but it does help withlymphatic drainage(the body’s internal cleansing system). I don’t love exercise but Idolove the sauna, so I’ll break a sweat there now and then. I drink water (hydration!) and eat water-rich foods (electrolytes!). I’m nuts about nuts and seeds (full of barrier-boosting Omegas), fermented snacks (probiotics), fiber (prebiotics) and bread (it’s basically anon-topical niacinamide serum).As for traditional skincare: at night, I wash with One Love Organics Vitamin B Enzyme Cleansing Oil or plain Manuka honey (trust me) and go to bed with bare skin. In the morning, it’s a splash of water, a few drops of jojoba oil – a close chemical match to human sebum,the body’s built-in moisturizer– and sunscreen. The one I’ve been using lately is from Solara. And, well, it’s called Guardian Angel SPF 50.Share your experienceAsk us a questionDo you have a beauty question for Ask Ugly?

She supports the group’s campaigns – for secular schools and assisted dying laws. More broadly, she says she has “always been struck” by its “steady calmness” – a port of irreligious decency in stormy times. “Since I was a child, I’ve found the idea of prioritising what came next over this bit a really weird concept. Everything starts and finishes in our minds.”View image in fullscreenEllis: ‘I’ve never been scared of saying what I think.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIt’s a tough time to be taking on the role, with politics increasingly polarised and US battles imported to the UK byevangelical Christian billionaire money. To be on the frontlines arguing for access to abortion, for instance, is now more exposing. “I’ve never been scared of saying what I think,” she says briskly. “The reassuring thing is, as you get older, it gets easier.” Just because you made your name as a children’s TV presenter, with an endless supply of sticky-backed plastic and things you made earlier, does not mean you’re without edge.Ellis was born in 1955 in Kent. Her father served in the army until she was 14, after which he joined a model-making company. She left school at 17 to go to what was then the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, and landed her first job three weeks after graduating – a small theatre part in which she spent most of her time on stage as a plant pot.Her dream was to make it as a theatre actor. “Telly in those days was a bit, ‘Well, if I have to,’” she says. At 22, she got a part appearing in four episodes of Doctor Who, shortly after started work as a presenter on the children’s show Jigsaw and then, at 23, became pregnant with the eldest of her three children,Sophie Ellis-Bextor.Having a baby was quite an unusual move for a young creative in a hurry, given that feminism’s second wave was well-advanced by the late 70s. “I think I just thought, ‘That looks easy,’” she says. Motherhood was, but staying married wasn’t. When she was 29, Sophie was four, and Ellis had just arrived on Blue Peter, she got divorced. It would have been career-ending had there been any publicity around it, “But I wasn’t in the age of X and Insta and paparazzi,” she says. “I established myself quite early on in my mind as somebody who was free to be.View image in fullscreen‘I think I just thought, “That looks easy”’ … Ellis on having her first child (Sophie Ellis-Bextor, above, left).Photograph: Clive Limpkin/Daily Mail/Rex/Shutterstock“Obviously, what I initially did to become well-known was a programme that had its own reputation that was pretty clean-living, pretty upright, pretty nice, but that was fine. I knew what I was outside. It’s like your kid at home is not necessarily the same as your kid at school. I could always divide the two.”View image in fullscreenReceiving her MBE, with her daugher Sophie, at Buckingham Palace in 2016.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesEvery moment of those Blue Peter years (1983 to 1987) seared itself into the consciousness of my generation – the pets, the Blue Peter garden, the badges, the craft projects. You never would have guessed that Elllis had never set out to be a TV presenter. In fact, she says, “When my agent first said, ‘What about presenting?’, I found it absolutely, outrageously awful as a suggestion, because obviously [she gestures with both arms in the opposite direction] the Royal Shakespeare Company is that way.” At the same time, she was a single parent: “If you’d been set it as a task at the outset – you’re going to have to get divorced, with a high-profile part in a squeaky clean children’s programme, you’d think, ‘That is going to be really hard’. But I just had to do it. My main thought was, I hoped I would meet somebody else, and I hoped it would be ok with a kid.”She met John Leach, a television producer, in her third year at Blue Peter – he was a friend of a friend. They got mad drunk on a night she was supposed to memorise her script, she managed it anyway, then called him and asked him out to the cinema. He played hard to get and said he’d seen everything that was out. “We ended up having to go to Aliens,” she says. She could do any night except Wednesday, because that was her other script evening, and that was the only night he could do. Still, they married in 1988, had two children – Jack and Martha – and were a fabled happy couple. Why he played so hard to get is lost to history.View image in fullscreenEllis at home with Angela.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianWhen Ellis left Blue Peter in 1989, there were rumours that she was fired because she was pregnant with her son, but that wasn’t it. “It was just the thought of trying to do it with a baby,” she says. “And when I said I wasn’t going to come back after having him, nobody went ‘Ohplease’.I wasn’t sacked, I effectively sacked myself.”After Martha was born, three years later, she presented the BBC magazine-format Open Air, and wrote a non-fiction book, How to Get Married without Divorcing Your Family, with fellow Blue Peter presenter Caron Keating.Leach died in 2020, when he was 63, two and a half years since he’d been diagnosed with tonsil cancer. “He was extraordinary,” she says. “The funniest person I’ve ever met. A brilliant stepfather to Soph; he took it on without examining it at all, and he was really close to her. She came on honeymoon with us. He was solid and smart and he never made a single enemy or anything like it, either professionally or privately, in his life.” He was a quiet man, and when they used to go out, he’d come home saying, “Do you think I said enough?”“It was ridiculous that he should die so young,” she says. It was an absolutely brutal time to have terminal cancer, right in the middle of the pandemic, when it was too dangerous to go into hospital. “Then a bit further along, there was no room at the inn – they were prioritising Covid. I have absolutely no idea, and to me it’s not worth examining, what would have happened with his treatment if the pandemic hadn’t happened, because it did. It’s funny, isn’t it. I never thought I’d be able to talk about it without crying, but here we are.” It’s terribly poignant to hear her talk about John. Even Angela the dog looks like she is about to start crying. With rueful determination, as if Ellis is on a director’s command to lighten the atmosphere, she says, “the godsend was, we had fantastic weather. We sat in the garden for months. And all we ever wanted, really, was to be together.”View image in fullscreenPresenters Simon Groom (with Goldie), Janet Ellis (with Jack) and Peter Duncan (with George) in the Blue Peter garden.Photograph: BBC Pictures ArchivesShe regrets that John didn’t live to see how Covid ended. “I felt really cheated for him.” And, that they had to hold his funeral with restrictions still in place. “We could have 15 people – and, you know, Soph’s got five kids, that pretty much did it.”It was during this period that Ellis-Bextor was the soundtrack-cum-mascot of the pandemic, broadcastingKitchen Discofrom her home 10 minutes away from Ellis’s, complete with glitterball and platform heels and kids of all ages (her youngest was tiny then – he’s now six), mucking in. It wasn’t a secret that John was dying, and Ellis makes no secret now of her profound grief, but the entire family takes this responsibility to keep cheerful incredibly seriously.Losing her husband is the only thing that’s ever wobbled Janet Ellis’s agnosticism. “If anything was going to challenge it, it would be the hope that you’d see someone again. But I’m not going to see him again … I genuinely find it comforting that we had a good timehere. I’m not waiting for another bit.”When she accepted the role at Humanists UK, she said to Andrew Copson, the chief executive, “‘Oh God, have I got to stop saying ‘Oh God?’” And he said, ‘No, it’s fine. Just try not to.’” It’s hard to imagine anyone who wouldn’t forgive it.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBlue PeterSophie Ellis-BextorChildren's TVAtheismReligioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Holed up in New York, writing and recording the follow-up to 2023’sCrazymad, for Me– which, despite critical acclaim and a Mercury nomination, was pronounced unsatisfactory by the singer herself – Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson suffered what sounds like a pretty terrifying breakdown. “I started actually hallucinating,” she said earlier this year. “I didn’t realise for the first two months that was what was happening, but I basically imagined the entire apartment I was staying in was crawling with insects … I went to the doctor and showed him my bites, and he said: ‘Those are stress hives; you’re mental.’”View image in fullscreenArtwork for Euro-Country.Photograph: CMATBaby/AWAL/PAOne assumes that wasn’texactlywhat he said, but you get the gist. And yet, despite its author comparing its recording to “a toxic relationship”, Euro-Country does not sound like it was challenging to make. On the contrary: it sounds like the supremely assured work of a songwriter whose powers have reached a new peak. It is, by turns, poignant, moving, furiously angry, uproariously funny and packed with incredible tunes. It strides confidently away from the country-infused style she minted on her 2022 debutIf My Wife New I’d Be Dead, into territory that touches on jazz (Janis Joplining), raging alt-rock (The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station) and soul-kissed pop (Running/ Planning; Take a Sexy Picture of Me) without losing the essence of what made her successful in the first place.Listen to her break the fourth wall during The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station, with a cry of “this is making no sense to the average listener”; pause her description of a collapsing relationship on When a Good Man Cries to castigate herself for being “the people’s mess, the Dunboyne Diana”; or deliver an opening as wait-what?as that of Lord, Let That Tesla Crash (“I heard death comes in threes / I misheard it, being from Dublin / I thought ‘death’s in the trees’ / Which makes sense because they’re the saddest cunts of plants”). Again and again, you’re struck by the sense that this could be the work of no one else.Before its release, Thompson expressed concern that the album’s socio-political bent would be read as “incredibly cringe and incredibly earnest”, but she needn’t have worried. A masterclass in addressing serious topics with a light, witty touch, and in allying her lyrics to hook-laden, undeniable melodies, Euro-Country addressed body-shaming, mental health, Irish identity and the iniquities of late-stage capitalism (“All the mooching around shops,” as she put it, “and the lack of identity”) without ever causing the listener to feel they were being lectured.CMAT, pop’s gobbiest, gaudiest star: ‘Everyone else in music needs a kick up the hole!’Read moreIt managed to interrogate the human cost of the 2008 financial crisis in Ireland – on a title track that featured references to mythical Irish warrior Cú Chulainn and Kerry Katonain the same line– and provoke a viralTikTok dance craze, promoted by Chicken Shop Date’s Amelia Dimoldenberg and actor Julia Fox, among others: by any metric, quite an achievement. It also informed a showstopping Glastonbury performance that felt like an infectious explosion of faintly chaotic joy.Thompson has described Euro-Country as “the most important album I’ve made”, and as the end of something: “breaking up with an old version of myself”. Understandably, she doesn’t “want to make another record where I’m self-flagellating for three months in a fucking weird apartment in New York and there’s imaginary insects crawling everywhere”. In that interview, she wondered aloud whether songwriting was a sustainable occupation for her; whether seeking treatment for her mental health might cause the flow of songs to stop. Whatever the future holds forCMAT, Euro-Country is a high-water mark in her career, and in pop music in 2025. It’s the triumphant work of an artist who seems out there on her own, completely inimitable: proof of the power of forging your own unique identity in a climate where the cookie-cutter too often prevails.Explore more on these topicsMusicBest music of 2025CMATIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesIn the 50 years since equal rights for women were enshrined in UK law, the campaigners have been reduced to caricatures, or forgotten. But their struggle is worth rememberingBySusanna RustinThu 18 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 06.30 ESTShareCelia Brayfield was at her desk in the Femail section of the Daily Mail’s Fleet Street office when an editor called her over. It was July and Wimbledon had started. “He said: ‘We want you to go down and get into the women’s changing rooms and report on lesbian behaviour.’ One didn’t normally swear at that time but I declined. That was the attitude then,” she told me.From the late 1960s until the early 70s, Brayfield was one of a small group of female journalists working on women’s pages in newspapers. “We were dealing with everyday sexism on an unbelievable scale,” she said. “You learned to wear trousers or take the lift because if you took the stairs someone would try to look up your skirt. But then you couldn’t go to a lot of press conference venues in trousers. In the Savoy, for example, women in trousers weren’t allowed.”Today, Brayfield is an author and lecturer living in Dorset. She started aged 19, as an assistant to Shirley Conran – then women’s editor of the Observer. When Conran moved to the Daily Mail, Brayfield went, too. “The Daily Mail was a very sexist organisation,” she told me. “I can’t tell you how awful women’s pages were, except forMary Stott’s at the Guardian. All the news of the women’s movement in America was flooding across the Atlantic, but editors were profoundly uninterested. I always thought you couldn’t mention anything to do with equality before the fifth paragraph. You were radicalised by your workplace.”Brayfield found her own way of reporting on developments in the women’s liberation movement (WLM), as the resurgent feminism of those years was known. She would set up interviews with the movement’s big hitters and then, when editors rejected them, offer them to the underground press instead. A piece on the radical feminist author Kate Millett was published by Frendz magazine, which Rosie Boycott co-edited before launching the women’s movement journalSpare Rib.Along with Conran, Brayfield also joinedWomen in Media, a pressure group set up in 1970 to challenge sexism in the industry and beyond. Its activities have been largely forgotten, and many of those involved have died. But it played a key role in the campaign to outlaw sex discrimination and enforce equal pay – as well as lobbying bosses for equal opportunities at work. One policy that especially riled them, and became a focus, was the broadcasters’ refusal to let women read the news. The public would find this “unnatural”, theBBC executive Robin Scotttold the Daily Mirror in 1972. “There’s always bad news about and it’s much easier for a man to deal with that.”Fifty years on, such brazen sexism appears comically old-fashioned. But the women’s libbers who confronted it have also often been the butt of jokes. While achievements such as equal pay and the establishment ofwomen’s refugesare recognised, the movement that fought for them has uncertain status. Second-wave feminists, as this generation is known, have been derided as man-hating harridans but also as entitled princesses – with their unrealistic demand for 24-hour nurseries and insufficiently intersectional politics. Their suffragette grandmothers, by contrast, are held up as courageous heroines.There had been a women’s movement pressing for employment rights since the 19th century, whenpioneering female trade unionistscampaigned for safer conditions and higher wages in shops and factories, and middle-class women fought for access to the professions. But even after the second world war, during which millions of women took on roles previously reserved for men, sexism was baked into workplaces. It was standard practice for women to be paid around four-fifths of what men earned for the same job, and sexist attitudes meant that women were routinely refused promotion. Senior and leadership positions were largely off-limits. Powerful politicians, employers and some trade unionists were determined that it should stay that way. When the House of Commons supported an amendment calling for equal pay for female teachers in 1944, Winston Churchill, the prime minister, was so determined to block it that he made the next vote on the issue a vote of confidence in the wartime government – effectively threatening to resign if it became law.That same year a woman calledJean Winderbecame the first female Hansard reporter, taking shorthand notes in parliament for the official record. Winder was a widow whose husband had been killed on active service, and a trained secretary. But her salary was less than that of her male colleagues, and in 1951 she complained. A Conservative MP, Irene Ward, became Winder’s champion and in 1954 they prevailed. But Ward and colleagues including Labour’sBarbara Castle, and feminist lobby groups including the Fawcett Society, argued that such discrimination must be made illegal across the board – not a matter for an employer’s discretion.A decade later, 187 sewing machinists at Ford’s Dagenham plant forced the issue.Their 1968 strikefor equal pay has become legendary due to the role played by Castle, the first female employment secretary, who met the women and negotiated with them directly, bringing an end to the four-week strike. But the pay rise they accepted (92% of the male wage instead of 85%) was not the “sex equality” they had demanded. The Equal Pay Act that went through parliament two years later was a compromise, too, with a five-year gap before implementation and equal pay only for employees doing work deemed to be “the same or broadly the same” or of “equal value” under the terms of a job evaluation process. Women inside and outside parliament wanted to go further, faster.On 7 March 1968, the Labour backbencher Joyce Butler challenged the prime minister, Harold Wilson, directly in the House of Commons: “Is my right honourable friend aware that women are fed up with being exploited as pretty birds when they are young, and as silly moos when they get older?” She wanted to know if he planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the1918 women’s suffrage billwith a law against sex discrimination. Wilson had been PM when the Race Relations Act, outlawing discrimination on grounds of colour, race and nation origins, had passed three years before.As the MP for Wood Green, Butler had received letters including one from a bus conductor who had been denied training because she was a woman. Between 1968 and 1971, Butler tried four times to introduce an anti-discrimination bill that would make it illegal for employers to treat male and female workers differently. William Hamilton, a Labour MP from Scotland, made a similar attempt in February 1972 while Nancy Seear, a Liberal peer who was also president of the Fawcett Society, put her name to a bill in the House of Lords.Women’s liberation activistswere also mobilising. Newsletters from the time report on efforts to gather half a million signatures on a petition demanding a sex discrimination bill (a target that later grew to 1 million), alongside initiatives including abortion rights, self-defence classes and a campaign to ensure that family allowances (child benefit paid to mothers) would not be replaced by tax credits paid to fathers.View image in fullscreenMary Stott, January 1971.Photograph: Peter Johns/The GuardianLobbying MPs was not everyone’s cup of tea. For the radicals in the movement, tinkering with the statute book was a paltry distraction from their ambition to reorder public and private life along feminist lines. An article in Spare Rib expressed fears that the broader aims of women’s liberation could be obscured by an anti-discrimination bill, in the same way suffrage activism was sidelined during the 1920s, after some women had won the vote, but not all.ButWomenin Media – which drew in young journalists like Brayfield and Mary Kenny, as well as an older generation including Mary Stott, who was Guardian women’s editor from 1957-72 – was determined to push a bill through. The group’s anti-discrimination bill action group (shortened to Adbag) became its centre of operations and pursued the issue energetically.Shirley Conran used a “Laura Ashley voice” with politicians, to avoid putting them off, and came up with the idea of decorating letters with red, heart-shaped fabric cut-outs. Brayfield was not convinced by this ploy, and some MPs were annoyed rather than charmed by letters warning them that lists were being kept of those for and against the bill. Replies to Women in Media complained of “press threats” and even “blackmail”.There were differences of opinion about publicity, too. In her memoir, Conran sounds more amused than outraged by the advice of Joyce Hopkirk, women’s editor at the Sun, that they needed a woman “in chains and a flesh-coloured bikini” to get coverage in the tabloids. Despite disagreements, Brayfield says the group “had some very dynamic people and we did understand how to manipulate our profession”.When Hamilton’s bill was debated in the Commons in February 1973, 700 women gathered in the grand Caxton Hall in Westminster, in what they called a Women’s parliament – an idea borrowed from the suffragettes – with speakers including May Hobbs of theCleaners’ Action Group, and a creche.Jill Tweedie, a Guardian women’s page columnist, brought a car boot full of wax torches that were sold for £1 each when the women processed to Downing Street.Spare Rib cover, December 1972, co-designed by Kate Hepburn.Photograph:  Spare RibThe next day of action fell on 28 June, when Stott took charge of delivering the petition to the queen at Buckingham Palace. With her was Alexandra Clark, the head girl of St Paul’s girls’ school. By this point a large coalition of supporting organisations had been assembled, ranging from the National Federation of Women’s Institutes to the Bakers’ union, British Women Pilots’ Association and Brides magazine. Dozens of letters were sent to the PM and deputations gathered for a “Day of Protest” in Westminster. Original suffrage movement banners were carried by Fawcett Society members and a wreath laid at the Emmeline Pankhurst statue in Victoria Tower Gardens by Dame Marjorie Corbett-Ashby, a 92-year-old former suffragette.This show of strength did not produce instant results and a few weeks later a Women in Media report declared – with capital letters for emphasis – that “If nothing emerges we will be justified in asking women to vote only for those MPs in favour of a sound Anti-Discrimination [Bill] MINDLESS OF PARTY LINES”. In August, the group secured a meeting with Margaret Thatcher, then the secretary of state for education and science. Susanne Puddefoot, who had been the Times women’s editor, went along and noted drily that Thatcher’s “considerable hostility” was “to say the least, a problem”.But persistence and publicity were paying off. While Thatcher was opposed, others in her party were more sympathetic and Janet Fookes, then the Conservative MP for Plymouth and now an 89-year-old member of the House of Lords, was one. She was not a feminist, she told me in a phone call, and did not personally experience sex discrimination in parliament. “But I was always quite independent-minded, and I don’t remember it causing any difficulties – a bill seemed a perfectly obvious thing to do.”Not everyone was enamoured of Women in Media’s self-appointed role. There was a cross exchange of letters with WLM organisers, and in 1974 Dodie Wheppler wrote to the Guardian on behalf of theSocialist Woman journalto complain about “the Women in Media group going from bad to unbelievable. A group of women sitting in a flat in Connaught Square (average freehold price, £45,000)”. While Wheppler’s objections were specific, they were also symptomatic of wider divisions at the time between those who were committed to reconciling feminism with socialism and those, such as Janet Fookes, who supported women’s rights but not leftwing politics.Twelve days before the first of 1974’s two general elections, on 16 February, another influential organisation upped its involvement and raised the political stakes. The National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) had recently set up a women’s rights committee with Patricia Hewitt, the future cabinet minister, as its first women’s officer. Its conference on women’s employment, held in the headquarters of the Trades Union Congress in London, brought a new formality and status to an issue that had until that point mostly been pushed by feminist lobby groups.View image in fullscreenPatricia Hewitt outside Westminster in 1981.Photograph: PA/PA Archive/Press Association ImagesHewitt belonged to a women’s consciousness-raising group as well, she told me. But unlike the leaderless WLM, the NCCL had a formal structure and affiliates. “So we were drawing on the energy of women’s liberation but also the energy of the trade unionists who had started themodern campaign for equal paywith the Ford Dagenham strike – the two threads came together at the Congress Hall.”There were still tensions. Many trade unionists were late or reluctant converts to equal pay, while some employers were implacably opposed. Hewitt also recalls awkward relations between women who had lived through the war, overcoming barriers of sexism to reach positions of influence, and radical baby boomers like her and Harriet Harman, an NCCL colleague. “My emotional recollection of that period is that there was an older generation of women, of whom Barbara Castle andShirley Williamswere two of the standouts, but there were a lot of women who had been battling misogyny in politics for a very long time. And they were a bit ambivalent about this new generation of stroppy women making demands,” she recalled.Feminists had reams of data thanks in part to a book by Audrey Hunt, A Survey of Women’s Employment. They put lists of examples on their leaflets and petitions: “Engineers and scientists: 7% women; trade union officials: only 25 women out of 1,400 paid officials; draughtsmen: only 1% are women (50% in Sweden).” Unwilling to wait for the law to change, one group launched a volunteer-run, prototype anti-discrimination board to gather evidence of unfair treatment. Women wrote in to report sexist pay structures in workplaces from advertising agencies to public swimming pools. One complaint came from a window-dresser at Harrods.In March 1974, Women in Media wrote to the prime minister,Harold Wilson, to say that a sex discrimination bill “must, in justice, be considered an urgent priority in any socialist programme” (the vaguer-sounding name of anti-discrimination bill was dropped in 1973). But with just 23 female MPs, they had limited backing in parliament. Shirley Summerskill, a minister in the Home Office, was one key ally. But Castle was busy trying to reform women’s pensions and, as Patricia Hewitt explains: “Labour women in those days were very careful about women’s issues because of getting typecast – some of them strongly supported the act but there was no organised force within the party.”In the summer of 1974, Women in Media decided to increase the pressure on Wilson by putting up its own candidate in the next election – expected to be soon as Labour did not have a majority. The woman chosen wasUna Kroll, a 48-year-old deaconess and GP in south London, with a remarkable family history which included growing up partly in the Soviet Union where both her parents were spies. A campaigner for the ordination of women, she described herself as having been radicalised by a patient who had died from cervical cancer, aged 29, after doctors refused to take her symptoms seriously.Since Women in Media was not a suitable name for a political party, the Women’s Rights Campaign was established on 6 September. In a bizarre coincidence – or what some feminists hoped was a panicked reaction to their bold move – the Home Office launched a white paper, Equality for Women, on the same day. Three days later it was announced that the election would be on 10 October. In the Guardian, Stott paid tribute to Kroll as a “top-class brain” and claimed that her candidacy in Sutton and Cheam was “the first time in this country that a woman has stood for parliament as a women’s rights candidate”.This was wrong – Christabel Pankhurst had been the sole candidate for a Women’s party in 1918, and lost by 775 votes. But while this disappointing coda to the suffrage movement was forgotten, Kroll’s supporters decked themselves in the suffragette colours of purple, white and green, and celebrity supporters including the actor Glenda Jackson donned sashes for photos. The manifesto was a checklist of issues including contraception, childcare and pensions as well as pay.View image in fullscreenWomen's liberation movement stages a protest against the sex discrimination bill.Photograph: Keystone Press/AlamyIn electoral terms, the Woman’s Rights Campaign was a flop. Kroll won just 298 votes. Records of the campaign in theWomen’s Librarysuggest that its activists fell down on canvassing. Most volunteers worked full-time and evening door-knocking sessions turned into chaotic late nights. In obituaries of Kroll, who died in 2017, her candidacy is referred to only briefly.But while the campaign did not succeed, it was an audacious stunt. It would be more than 40 years before theWomen’s Equality partywould try something similar on a larger scale. And in publicity terms, it had an effect. Newspapers reported on the Women’s Rights Campaign with interest and when Labour won a majority, it quickly announced that sex discrimination would be outlawed. The NCCL produced a draft bill and the details were argued over in and outside parliament.Under the Conservatives, proposed exceptions to a ban on employment discrimination had included the clergy, prisons, police, armed forces and “foster-mothering”. Labour agreed with feminist lobby groups that this list should be shorter. Another issue was how far beyond the world of work the act would apply. Feminists wanted sex discrimination outlawed in one fell swoop. A motion from the WLM conference in Manchester in April 1975 was headed “WE ARE STILL ANGRY” and declared: “The movement severely condemns obvious fundamental omissions of discrimination such as pensions, taxation, social security, etc.” While education and services were included in Labour’s bill, with some exceptions, ministers resolved that financial matters would be dealt with separately.One debate was about the powers of the new equality board. Feminists argued that inspectors ought to be able to check up on employers, and ensure that the law was being obeyed. If it was left to individual women to raise complaints, they feared that nothing would change.Feminists did not win all the arguments. The equal opportunities commission (as the board was named) gained the power to investigate but only “with the agreement of the secretary of state”. Women in Media described the bill as “timid tinkering with a problem that needs all-out assault” and criticised the exemption for small employers and partnerships including solicitors: “We notice that the law, as usual, has protected its own bastions.” But the inclusion of indirect as well as direct discrimination was a victory. And members were happy enough that when the bill passed one of its stages in October, they threw a party.The Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts both came into force on 29 December 1975, on the same day that the equal opportunities commission (EOC) was established in Manchester. Early in 1976 its first chair,Betty Lockwood, sent out invitations to a meeting. Hewitt remembers that “Harriet [Harman] had a car that could face the distance so we all squashed in and drove up and were quite vociferous.”With sex discrimination outlawed, it would now be up to the commission and judges to oversee enforcement. Hewitt and Harman were immediately on the lookout for women with complaints strong enough to take to tribunals – “test cases” that would set precedents. One soon emerged, when a woman called Belinda Price approached the commission about the civil service. Price had been barred from applying for a role in the Foreign Office on grounds of an age limit of 29 that she believed was indirect sex discrimination – since women were far more likely than men to have taken time off to have children, and therefore to miss out. When the commission declined to pursue Price’s complaint, the NCCL took it up instead, and won.In 1977, Women in Media published a book about sexism in radio, television and so on, intended for use on the new women’s studies courses that were springing up in universities. Adbag had turned into Flag (the Feminist Legislation Action Group), signalling broader aims than “anti-discrimination”, and kept on lobbying. It wanted the EOC to develop proposals aimed at eliminating stereotypes. In the House of Commons and outside, Labour MPs including Maureen Colquhoun and Jo Richardson championed further feminist legislation. In 1983, the Equal Pay Act was amended to apply to “work of equal value”. Women in Media was absorbed by the Fawcett Society.In 2006, New Labour legislated to dissolve the EOC. Its replacement, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, came into existence the following year, fulfilling the ambition first voiced in the 1970s for one body monitoring discrimination across different characteristics. In 2010, earlier anti-discrimination laws were combined in the Equality Act.Feminists of the 1970s were later criticised for a too-narrow focus and demographic, and Women in Media could be seen as an exemplar. Mary Kenny remembers finding meetings “a bit bourgeois”. Conran surely had in mind the long-running comic stripThe Four Marys, in the girls’ comic Bunty, when she recalled that the bill campaign included three Shirleys, all of whom had attended St Paul’s – herself, Shirley Williams and Shirley Summerskill (the adventures of the Four Marys took place at the fictional St Elmo’s).‘They were dying, and they’d not had their money’: Britain’s multibillion-pound equal pay scandalRead moreBut the movement is too easily caricatured. Many of those who lobbied for the sex discrimination bill were active in other campaigns, including one against the deportation of a group of Irish women who had been caught stealing. Their proposals included a clause updating nationality laws so that women would gain the same entitlement as men to bring foreign spouses to Britain – highly topical in the context of Idi Amin’s expulsion of Ugandan Asians. Concerns about whether working-class women in low-paid jobs would be able to afford to take employers to tribunal were raised repeatedly. There were also efforts to add sexual orientation to the bill, so that gay men and lesbians would also gain protection. One women’s group proposed a civil rights appeals board, in place of employment tribunals, to adjudicate in cases dealing with race as well as sex.“These things are always a compromise,” says Patricia Hewitt. “By 1980 we were saying ‘there’s not enough in this act’, but I think in 1975 we felt we’d done pretty well.”“What I remember most is the sense that we actually achieved something,” says Brayfield. “We were dealing with an enormous social injustice and an extremely resistant patriarchy or power structure that didn’t want to change. We really did set out to change our society and to make life better for our daughters but it’s a fight you have to keep winning. There’s never any sitting back and saying ‘we’ve won’ because you never have.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readFeminismWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)Women in journalismWomen's suffrageMade in DagenhamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is, in the nicest possible way, a lotThu 18 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 06.21 ESTShareIwrote a piecea few weeks ago railing at the app-heavy facelessness of dealing with the NHS about what I believe is known as one’s care pathway. My point was that it might be efficient if reducing head count in admin departments is what counts as efficiency, but not if clear communication is the aim. The whole palaver of the comms around the journey to diagnosis was more of a drama than the diagnosis itself, which was for a very mild variant of skin cancer. As fond as I am of a wallow in self-pity and catastrophisation, even I couldn’t get myself into a panic over this. So I certainly wasn’t courting sympathy or concern by making too much of it, and I was as careful as possible to get this across.But then a couple of media outlets ran clickbait-type headlines along the lines of AC REVEALS HE HAS CANCER. And everything went nuts; thoughts and prayers came streaming in from all quarters. There were family and friends – to whom I’d not mentioned it because I didn’t think it merited a mention. There were people I’d not heard from in years.Letters. Text messages. Passwords and more passwords. Why can’t the NHS just give me someone to talk to? | Adrian ChilesRead moreInitially, I was just embarrassed. Then I got a bit annoyed – had no one got beyond the headlines and read any of the actual articles, which all made it clear it was nothing serious? And then I felt bad about feeling annoyed because people were only being nice.And still the thoughts and prayers came in – from a beleaguered family I know in Jerusalem, and from friends whose lives have been – or are – on the line with more serious forms of cancer. And the more I protested that it was nothing, I started worrying that it might be something after all, as if everyone knew something I didn’t.I went to see West Brom play at Queens Park Rangers. In the pub, a huge, rather dangerous-looking bloke clasped my hands in his, looked me in the eye and said he’d be praying for me in church on the Sunday. A bloke running a burger van said, “I’ve been through it, mate. Terrible.” The poor man had been really very ill indeed with bowel cancer. I did my best to summon words to convey compassion without implying I was remotely in the same boat. But then perhaps, in the nicest possible way, he drew some comfort from having me in the same boat.It was a lot. I still feel bad about the fuss. But most of all I am grateful to be living in what feels like a caring world. And I wish everyone a very happy Christmas.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just when you thought BP was trying to generate less drama, the new chair has decided a new chief executive is needed. Say goodbye to Murray Auchincloss,who junked the green-ish transition strategyof his predecessor as recently as February. Meg O’Neill, the American boss of the Australian group Woodside Energy, becomesBP’s first outside hire as chief executive.At face value, a new appointment should not be an outright surprise. Albert Manifold arrived as BP chair in July and, after the many flip-flops underthe ineffectual Helge Lund, he had a mandate to take his own view of how the company should be managed. If he and the board think an injection of “increased rigour and diligence” is necessary to fulfil the new oilier plan, fair enough. The activist investor Elliott may have been urging much the same. Even Auchincloss recognised the possibility he could be axed. His statement said he had told Manifold of his “openness to step down” if a new leader was identified.Meg O’Neill: the ‘hard-nosed’ boss hired to be the new head of BPRead moreYet there is still a puzzle here on two counts. First, Auchincloss had seemed to be making progress on the share price front. As the co-author, as finance director, of his predecessor’s green-tinged approach, he was forever tainted in the eyes of the stick-to-hydrocarbons camp of investors. Yet this year’s “reset” strategy to boost investment in oil and gas and cut funding for clean energy projects served up most of the U-turns demanded by the City. BP’s shares, helped bya big oil and gas find in Brazil, are up 10% this year, in line with Shell and better than Chevron.Second, O’Neill’s record of producing shareholder value atWoodsideisn’t much to shout about. Yes, there has been vigorous deal-making on her watch, and lots of dividends have been paid, but Woodside’s share price performance is actually worse than BP’s since April 2021. Her run-ins with climate activists in Australia will reinforce the message that BP is serious about its strategic U-turn, but that has not been in doubt for the past year. The point is that Woodside is not an obvious example of how to produce knockout returns. She spent 23 years climbing the ladder at the big beast ExxonMobil, which may have grabbed BP’s attention, but Woodside is the company she has been running for the last four.BP’s share price was unmoved on the news that, as Manifold put it, the change at the top is “an opportunity to accelerate” the plan for a “simpler, leaner and more profitable company”. Yes, but how exactly?BPis carrying a bigger debt burden than most of its rivals, which limits pace. The current aim is to sell its lubricants business Castrol and a share of its solar developer Lightsource. Even with a push from a newcomer, however, the shape of the balance sheet won’t be clear until 2027. The latest challenge is a falling oil price.Or maybe the Manifold/O’Neill vision is for a deeper round of disposals. What BP calls “mobility” – petrol stations, in old money – could come into the frame. But one assumes O’Neill has primarily been hired as a cost-cutter. Until shareholders see how her numbers differ from Auchincloss’s, however, there is not much to go on. He was also chanting the “leaner” mantra.O’Neill arrives in April, and investors will have to wait a few months after that for hard targets. Maybe she will turn out to be the perfect turnaround merchant and the person who finally kills the speculation that BP’s destiny is to be taken over by a bigger rival – even if Shellisn’t currently volunteering. Certainly, a culture shock of some sort seems to be intended. It is just not clear what exactly.Explore more on these topicsBPNils Pratley on financeEnergy industryOilOil and gas companiesWoodsidenewsShareReuse this content"

Richard Pearson is visiting Surrey to close down his late father’s home and settle his affairs and, everywhere he looks, the flag of St George is flying “from suburban gardens and filling stations and branch post offices”. How nice, he thinks, how festive.Soon he learns the truth.So runs the opening not of a recent piece of journalism, but a novel byJG Ballard, Kingdom Come, which despite being almost 20 years old anticipates today’s Britain with eerie precision. In the mid-2000s, Pearson reads up on his new surroundings, only to find the same headlines that assail us in the mid-2020s: “Every day the local newspaper reported attacks on an asylum hotel, the torching of a Bangladeshi takeaway, injuries to a Kosovan youth thrown over the fence into an industrial estate.”The crusader crosses of St George, the hair clay and bloviating of GB News and the live-streaming, selfie-gurning, hate-spewing ofTommy Robinson– their spirit is better captured in this last fiction by the late Ballard than in many more recent and more breathless titles clogging up the annual best-of lists.At the fag-end of 2025, the UK stands possibly only three-and-a-half years away from electing rightwing extremists to power, led by a man among whose sparse credentials for office are that he has never “directly racially abused” anyone. To explain this, analysts and campaigners often reach for stories of Russian money or US networks, or for analogies with German nazism. Such accounts emphasise how unusual and exotic such movements are in Britain, how positivelyforeign. The land that once boasted it couldn’t happen here can now only splutter that at least it didn’t begin here.This is bad history and worse politics. Analogies can never pass for analysis. Nor does studying the rich funders ofNigel Farageor Robinson explain their hoi polloi followers. Fittingly for a writer who titled one of his stories Myths of the Near Future, Ballard observes the country of his time to glimpse the society of our times.Everything in Kingdom Come happens in Brooklands, a suburb that wants to pretend nothing is happening. We are not in some supposedly benighted outpost of the north-east or south Wales, with cheap sentiment about the snaggletoothed “left behind”, but a junction off the M25. Rather than Epping, the centre of lastsummer’s protests against asylum hotels, we’re out west, among the “orbital cities of the plain, as remote as Atlantis and Samarkand to the inhabitants of Chelsea and Holland Park”. Out here are forests of business parks and convention centres, thickets of discount furniture warehouses and cheap takeaways. The great leisure activity is the gleaming giant shopping mall, which boasts “more retail space than the whole of Luton”.Amid this yawning suburbia, Pearson starts to come awake. One evening, he sees an old Volvo up in flames, and an angry mob about to storm a “shabby house”. Inside, he supposes, must be “a released murderer or a paedophile exposed by the local vigilantes”. But no. Out come Muslim women, who have been praying in a makeshift mosque and who must rely on a police line against violence from their own neighbours. As for the white locals, they have taken to wearing red crosses – not for football matches but for an entirely different kind of kickabout, where they set on Asian shopkeepers.It’s a mark of Ballard’s powers of observation that he spotted as far back as the 2000s that it would be to London’s perimeter where ethnic minorities would now be moving. The centre of the capital is not only turning whiter and richer, but the author could see how, a full decade before the Brexit vote, its enemies were defining the place as anti-English: “The West End, Bloomsbury, Notting Hill, Hampstead – they’re heritage London, held together by a dinner-party culture. Here, around the M25, is where it’s really happening. This is today’s England.”Today, politicians, economists and journalists talk of the 2000s in tones of pure elegy. Imagine! One prime minister who spent more than a decade in office. House prices always rising. Flights to third-tier European cities for 99p. Easy credit and ever-cheaper goods coming in from China. Coalmines were turning into call centres, factories were becoming malls and a productive economy was turning to consumption. In the middle of the 2000s, the former mining town of Barnsley began planning to turn itself into aTuscan hill village, ringed by a circle of torch lights.Yet before the decade was out came an almighty crash, from which the UK has never recovered, and even before that living standards for middle- and working-class households were starting to deteriorate. In the middle of the 2000s, the going was good only for those Britons who didn’t look down to see the sands on which their lifestyles were built.Ballard was one of the very few who did look down. In his telling, Brooklands is a bubble land, and the air is already escaping. Its landscape is post-industrial Britain, built on Westminster renewal funds and property developers promising regeneration. Still, shoppers aren’t going to the mall, he notes, they’re starting to trade down. Meanwhile, the town’s top brass think the solution is to clear the mall’s hinterland of migrants, so that it can be expanded. And so they incite race riots.Near the apex of this brand-heavy, unproductive society is a guy who used to act in EastEnders and The Bill and now presents on the mall’s own cable TV channel (which gets better nightly ratings than BBC Two). But David Cruise has his eye on Westminster. As spin doctors and columnists talked about “retail politics”, an actual retailer fancies a crack at parliament. Cruise is defined in terms that could apply to many of those at the top today: “Today’s politics is tailor-made for him. Smiles leaking everywhere, mood music, the sales campaign that gets rid of the need for a product. Even the shiftiness. People like to be conned. It reminds them that everything is a game.”Twenty years after this story was printed, we are just starting to write the history of the strange death of neoliberal England. Yet Kingdom Come demonstrates that our current mess has a long, long history. The bleakness that surrounds today’s politics stretches back to when the sun was out all day long and not a cloud was to be seen.

We have once again arrived at the eye of the storm for the holidays, where cheerfulness is mandatory and lack of goodwill towards people is punishable by stoning in the town square. Surely, I don’t have to tell you that such quaint human emotions as “happiness” and “hope” are in short supply these days. This year, of all years, no one should be blamed for plugging their ears any time Mariah Carey comes on in the lobby of the unemployment office. And yet, we carry on with the rituals of joy that seem more and more incongruous, when life feels like some never-ending episode of MTV’s Ridiculousness, where God comments on clips of the human race getting hit in the face with a plastic baseball bat.I’m certainly making an effort to put on a pleasant facade. I’ve cobbled together some nice gifts for my friends and family. I say hello to strangers, even the ones that look like they might want to deny me my basic rights as outlined in the US constitution. And I say yes to just about every holiday party invite – save for one massive exception.White elephant parties.You know the ones: you are asked to bring a gift not to exceed a set dollar amount (usually between $50 and $100). The wrapped, secret gifts go into a common slush pile, and guests take turns selecting the one they think they’ll enjoy the most, based entirely on size, packaging and raw gut instinct. You might win big with a useful gadget or a rare knick-knack that only you would find charming. But, dear reader, there’s the chance that someone behind you in the turn line will choose to steal your gift for themselves, sending you back to rummaging through the boxes and bags in the pile. I can’t think of a more dispiriting feeling than unwrapping a hardcover edition of a book you’ve been meaning to read or a pair of bluetooth headphones and having it ripped from your hands like you’re an infant about to put a nine-volt battery in your mouth. The person who invented this cursed activity takes more pleasure in witnessing pain than a dominatrix working the hotel at the Republican national convention.White elephant exchanges have been aroundsince the early 20th centuryand have alternatively been referred to as the “Dirty Santa” (not to be confused with the film Bad Santa) or “Yankee Swap” (which sounds like the title of a risque reality show on the Discovery Channel). The term “white elephant” actually means an object that’s valuable, but so expensive to maintain – and useless – that it’s not worth owning. Even the name of these parties makes them feel like a cruel joke, designed only to stymie, frustrate and alienate.The last time I attended one of these culturally sanctioned, non-sexual cuck parties, I ended up with a “miniature zen garden”, which sounds somewhat appealing. Who doesn’t want a tiny bit of zen in their lives right now? I’d certainly rather have that than the opposite – the low hum of despair that is the 12 hours a day we are forced to be awake. In reality, the “miniature zen garden” is a bag full of sand you dump into a small, flimsy balsa wood box. Never mind the cultural appropriation required to enjoy these. They are also incredibly annoying. I knocked mine over after about a week, and spilled the sand all over my hardwood floor. Not only did I no longer have a “miniature zen garden”, I now had a mess to clean up. Thanks.You might be wondering what I brought to that white elephant. The honest truth is I don’t remember. All I can recall is that it was absolutely not something good or fun or worth keeping, because the gifts at these parties never are. Countless Barnes & Noble locations across the United States are currently being swarmed by customers scrambling through the weird section of the store by the checkout register with rack after rack of fidget spinners,tiny copies of The Wizard of Ozthat can only be read by lab rats, and a box full of scented candles. A zombie horde of obligation.I am well aware that the point of any holiday party is to be together with friends and loved ones. The presents should, ideally, be secondary to the company of those we care about most. The holiday season allows us a moment to reflect on the past year, to share our hopes for the next one, and reaffirm the bonds that make us human. These sentiments are more crucial than ever. So why do we have to sully it all with a musical chairs sideshow of garbage? It’s time, at last, to make the white elephant extinct!OK … I realize that last sentence could come off the wrong way.I just mean the parties.Merry Christmas!Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsChristmasOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

That’s where leadership comes inThu 18 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 12.35 ESTShareAs you listen to a Christmas performance of Handel’s Messiah, it is easy to persuade yourself that all is still well with music and the arts in Britain. I again felt the familiar potency of both Messiah and of music more widely in London’s St Martin’s-in-the-Fields on Tuesday this week. When the musicians and singers launched into the fabulously affirmative final chorus, Worthy is the Lamb, towards which Handel and his librettist Charles Jennens have all along been building, the annual ritual poured forth Messiah’s deep sense of shared security and allayed doubt afresh.I’ve been going to Messiah at Christmas for decades now, at one venue or another, and the experience never ceases to lift the spirits in this darkest of seasons. This year, though, more disturbing feelings were also in play. The tender balm of Messiah’s opening lines for the tenor – “Comfort ye, comfort ye my people” – has rarely sounded more necessary and consolatory than it did this week. The austere solemnity of the oratorio’s collective reprimand against “the iniquity of us all” felt very contemporary too, especially at the end of such a dismal, demented and dangerous year.Yet music and the arts are not secure in Britain today. Instead, they are becoming increasingly insecure, as well as more marginal and marginalised. There are lots of different reasons for this process. But there should be absolutely no mistaking that it is happening. It would be dishonest not to admit that the media’s own steady marginalisation of the arts and culture, notably but not only atthe BBC, is one of the important causes.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer playing the flute at a Duke of Edinburgh awards ceremony in 1980.Photograph: Family handout/Labour PartyBritain’s long and stupid psychodrama over so-called cultural elitism certainly doesn’t help. As Someone Else’s Music, the title of Alexandra Wilson’s brilliant new book on Britain’s tragicomic modern agonising about opera, implies, ours is often a society of culturally closed minds. How can an opera ticket costing £100 (and plenty of opera tickets cost less than that) be denounced as elitist when most World Cup tickets are costing thousands of dollars? This country has a pathetic capacity for concentrating on silly partisan squabbles while resolutely ignoring the bigger picture.Educational inequality is fundamental to this. Kids at state schools simply have far less access to the arts than kids in private schools. You can see the results in our often socially top-heavy conservatoires and arts colleges. With a few brilliant exceptions, like Trinity Laban Conservatoire in south-east London (where I was on the board for some years), it’s the expensively educated who get most of the chances, not those from less privileged backgrounds. Labour says it wants arts subjects to becentral to the school curriculum, but until that actually happens and works its way through the system, we will continue to reproduce the widening unfairnesses of today.Not all of the problems of the cultural sectors come down to money. But an awful lot of them do. Whether at the individual, the corporate or the state level, we are simply too mean. Too many rich people do not put anything back (all credit to the few who do, but shame on the rest). Too many companies have minimal sponsorship or charitable budgets (hats off to the exceptions here too). And governments, whether local, devolved or national, are under spending pressures that make it easy to treat culture as an optional extra, which they do.In herhugely welcome and satisfyingly coruscatingreport on the iniquitous work of Arts Council England (ACE) this week, Margaret Hodge reminds us that Britain spends significantly less per head on culture (widely defined) than almost every country in Europe. Greater Berlin alonespends more on culturethan the entire combined arts and culture budgets of ACE and the London mayor. German public funding is under a lot of pressure itself right now, but this is a societal choice, and Britain is making the wrong one.View image in fullscreenEdward Heath with conductor and composer André Previn in 1975.Photograph: David Thorpe/ANL/Rex/ShutterstockThere is something depressing about the fact that, inKeir Starmer, Britain now has its first prime minister with a musical training since Edward Heath more than half a century ago. I am always pleased when Starmer mentions the importance of music or talks to the media about the music he likes. But the time for talk really is over. It’s time for deeds, commitment and results. Time for leadership.The Hodge report offers a blueprint for overdue change. At its heart is the vital recognition that excellence and access should not be pitted against one another as alternatives. If its findings are to be listened to, it ought to mean the application of the lessons of sports funding to arts funding, in which the best and the rest both matter. For Team GB and your local running track, read English NationalOperaand your local playhouse. It also ought to mean a clearout of ACE leadership and a restructuring. But will Starmer’s government embrace it, own it and drive it? The suspicion is that the government, struggling in the polls, will neither care enough nor dare enough.Yet government has a unique responsibility that civil society, however strongly motivated, cannot equal. When the audience stands for the Hallelujah chorus at the end of part two of Messiah, we are not just taking part in a quirky British tradition (audiences in other countries tend to stay seated). We are also making a collective avowal. We are recognising the worth of what we have all inherited, should all cherish, and, echoing the lines that bring Alan Bennett’s The History Boys to its close, should all pass on. That is the government’s duty too. Yes, we must all do our bit, but it is government’s turn now.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCultureOpinionOperaArts Council EnglandArts fundingMargaret HodgeKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

As a minister, but also as a father, I see Labour’s new strategy as a matter of the highest priorityDavid Lammy MP is the deputy prime minister, lord chancellor and secretary of state for justiceThu 18 Dec 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 03.21 ESTShareIn the year leading up to March 2025, one in eight women in England and Waleshad been a victimof domestic abuse, sexual assault or stalking. Almost 200 rapes are recorded every day. And on average,three women are killedby men in the UK every single week. Just pause and consider that.There has been plenty of tough talk on violence against women and girls over the past decade – but too little action. We will deploy the full power of the state in the largest crackdown on violence perpetrated against women and girls in British history. This violence is a national emergency. And as a dad to a daughter, it terrifies me. But as a dad to two sons, it drives home that we can’t keep doing things the same way.So much of this violence is fuelled by the casual misogyny that seeps through our culture, amplified online. Today’s children are growing up in a digital world many parents barely recognise. A place where pornography is easy to access, misogyny spreads fast and loud – and hateful voices tell our boys that control is strength and empathy is weakness.Such figures include Andrew Tate, of whom 41% of young men now say theyhave a positive view. Other studies show that our young men are becomingmore regressive in their attitudesto consent and equality – something that should concern us all.That’s why the prime ministerhas madetackling violence against women and girls a personal priority. And it’s why this government has set a clear, ambitious target: to halve this violence within a decade.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators march against rising violence against women and girls, London, 18 January 2025.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesToday,we launch a new strategyto deliver on that promise. This is a radical approach: a whole-system response that accepts this crisis cannot be fixed by any one institution alone. The strategy focuses on three things: stopping young men being pulled towards harm, stopping abusers and supporting victims.We will crack down on perpetrators with the full force of the state, harnessing better data, smarter policing and specialist teams to identify the most dangerous offenders, disrupt them and pursue them relentlessly.And we are strengthening protection for victims – including through a national expansion ofdomestic abuse protection orders, allowing courts to impose curfews, tagging and exclusion zones on abusers, with tough penalties for breaches. All of this is backed by bold reform of the criminal courts – to deliver the swifter justice that victims deserve.But in truth, this fight starts much earlier than the criminal justice process. If we are serious about culture change – about building a country where women and girls can live free from fear, respected and safe – the battle begins with how we raise our boys.We are making it harder for kids to access harmful, misogynistic content, criminalising strangulation pornography, and putting the onus on tech companies tostop cyberflashingunder the online safety act.But by the time a perpetrator is hauled before the courts, it’s already too late. So prevention sits at the heart of this strategy. We will support schools and parents to teach consent, respect and healthy relationships with confidence. And we will challenge the harmful stereotypes that are often baked in early: that boys shouldn’t cry, that asking for help is weakness, that “real men” hide their feelings.As someone who struggled through his teenage years without a dad, I know how crucial positive male role models are. And we need more men in this conversation – as allies and advocates.So next year, I will bring together a national summit on men and boys – not to lecture, but to listen. To shape a better story about what it means to be a man in Britain today.These measures protect women and girls. But they also protect boys from being drawn into this culture. Because toxic masculinity and violence against women and girls are very much connected. To end one, we must confront the other. I want my daughter to grow up without fear. I want my sons to grow up knowing that masculinity can be kind.This strategy represents the largest crackdown to stop violence against women and girls in British history. It’s a change that belongs to every one of us.David Lammy MP is the deputy prime minister, lord chancellor and secretary of state for justiceDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Big changes in policing and the courts are needed tooThu 18 Dec 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 15.30 ESTShareLabour set itself a mammoth task when it pledged, before last year’s election, tohalve violence against women and girls(VAWG) in 10 years. While many forms of crime have decreased over the past decade, sexual assault has not. In the year to March 2025,1.9% of peoplein England and Wales experienced it, and82%of victims were female. The prevalence of image-related offences has risen sharply. So has concern about the impact on young men of violent pornography and influencers.Given this grim backdrop, and the fiscal constraints under which the government has chosen to operate, it is no wonder that the promised VAWG strategy was delayed. This is a societal issue that does not sit neatly in one government department. Jess Phillips is the minister responsible at the Home Office. Buteducation and justice reformsare also essential if aims are to be met.The hope is that this can be a successful example of cross-government working. The risk is that a complicated range of issues are bundled together in such a way that no one has ownership and can be held to account. David Lammy, the justice secretary,wrote in the Guardianthis week that “toxic masculinity and violence” are connected. Prevention is prominent in the strategy, with plans for new “healthy relationships” content in the schools curriculum and a referral pathway for boys with attitudes that are deemed harmful. Next year, a national summit on challenges facing men and boys is planned.Such initiatives could be worthwhile if they are well executed and are followed through. Thesexualised aggressionfaced by female pupils and teachers is appalling, and Ofcom also has a role in ensuring that online harms are reduced. But this must not become a distraction from policing and prosecuting offenders, the vast majority of whom are adult men who will be untouched by such schemes.One thing that clearly had to be in place before the strategy’s launch was a chair for the national inquiry into grooming gangs. The appointment last week ofAnne Longfieldmeans that this process should soon begin. The attitudes of offenders, and public authorities, will be a focus here too.The national rollout of domestic abuse protection orders is welcome. So is the pledge of more specialist officers. But the lack of a budget is concerning, and ministers need to explain how existing resources will be stretched or redirected. Also dismaying is feedback from the women’s sector that points to a lack of consultation.The £550m funding increase for victim support services is a tangible gain. But arguably what victims need more than anything else is for the criminal and family justice systems to work better. At the moment, the huge backlogs in crown court cases mean that some women who have experienced sexual violence wait years for a trial date. If delays become too long and victims, or witnesses, drop out, justice is denied. Issues specific to the family courts, where many allegations of domestic and sexual abuse are examined, include thelack of legal aidanduse of unregulated experts.All these problems were never going to be solved in one fell swoop. But having promised radical change in their manifesto,Labourministers must deliver it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The problem is that its enemies will never see it that wayThu 18 Dec 2025 13.27 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 15.29 ESTShareMorally, the decision facing the European Council in Brussels this week has been a no-brainer. Russia invaded Ukraine illegally and unilaterally. Moscow shows no sign of wanting peace. It actively threatens other countries too, including Britain. Ukraine is running out of money. Yet£184bn worthof Russian assetsremain frozenin Europe, notably in Belgium. That money should therefore be mobilised to fund Ukraine. To many, this would be the enactment of a clear and present duty, proof positive that Europe can still be a heavy hitter.In the messy reaches of the real world, however, things have not been straightforward. Law, economics and politics all managed to insinuate themselves, sometimes venomously, into the intense buildup to Brussels. Reparations can have lethal political consequences. Seizure of assets will undoubtedly face legal challenge. It is also bitterly opposed byDonald Trump, who wants the unfreezing of assets to form a key part of his pro-Russian peace plan. Mr Trump is pressing hard for a quick deal, and US and Russian negotiators are poised to meet again in Miami at the weekend.The EU has worked hard to come up with a funding plan for Ukraine that mobilises the value of the assets without simply transferring them to Kyiv. Their loan proposal is ingenious and, in its supporters’ eyes, both legal and essential. It will never be seen that way in Moscow or Washington. Several EU states still opposed itas the summit began. Belgium, in particular, was on a knife-edge. Bond markets may punish states for taking on part of the risk. Millions of voters suffering cost of living pressures may balk at such megabuck deals too.And what wider precedent might be set by such moves? The cold truth is that this ultimately depends on the outcome on both the battlefield and at the diplomatic level. There is no magic bullet that can end this conflict and it cannot be assumed that an EU loan based on Russian assets will be a complete gamechanger either. It is not as if nearly four years of sanctions have brought the Russian economy to its knees as originally hoped, thanks in large part to oil sales to the likes of China and India.Longer-term consequences matter too. If the loan goes through but fails to help turn the tide forUkraine, it could be much harder for Europe to claim the moral high ground in any future standoff, such as over Taiwan. Europe’s otherwise admirable attempt at solidarity might in fact end by opening a global Pandora’s box of even more ruthless economic nationalism. There are no easy wins to be had here.The potency of all these questions, plus a host of others that are equally difficult to resolve, explain three large things. First, they tell us why this week’s European summit, which continues on Friday, is so massively important for Ukraine. Second, they underline why it is at least as important, though in a different existential way, for the future of theEU. Third, and unsurprisingly, it makes clear why there was no early consensus in Brussels in the first part of the summit.Overshadowing everything, however, is a reality that remains true whatever decision emerges in Brussels.Without the activationof the Russian assets, the west cannot continue much longer to bankroll a war that may soon enter its fifth year. It is why, on so many fronts, this is the moment of truth.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Would we need to get rid of our Nigerian priests? Our Filipino altar servers? Our Nigerian readers? The African-Caribbean man who does the collections? Our admin staff from east Africa? And don’t even start me on all the Irish, Burmese, Congolese and Indian people who come to mass. Our local imam can always be relied on to attend our multifaith events – do we have to uninvite him, as well as our Jewish friends? And, dare I say it, we will be celebrating the birth of a Jew born in Palestine.Nollaig shona daoibh.Dr Ronan CormacainFinsbury Park, LondonI was hugely relieved when some senior leaders from the Anglican church issued their response to Tommy Robinson’s “carols event”. Robinson’s latest attempt to shamelessly exploit his newfound Christianity to build opposition to our multifaith society should be challenged and exposed for what it is – the work of an evil man.Given that there are26 bishops in the House of Lords,this could and should run for some time – even through to the enthronement of the new archbishop of Canterbury in 2026. Perhaps these bishops could be joined by Catholic cardinals, free church moderators and the chief rabbi too. None of this should prevent those of no, or little, faith from confronting the falsehoods that Robinson peddles. He is bankrolled by some obscenely wealthy people and cannot be ignored.Les BrightExeter, DevonMainstream Christianity has tended to cite good works as evidence of repentance (In what sense is Tommy Robinson a genuine Christian? None that I can see, 10 December). Interestingly, when John the Baptist sees the Pharisees and Sadducees trying to muscle in on his repentance followed by baptism programme (Matthew 3.8), he tells them that they can forget about repentance until they “bear fruit worthy of repentance”.

The article suggests that this is due to the declining quality and safety of NHS maternity care. But this is not true. The problem of increasing haemorrhage after birth is not simple, and neither women nor the quality of maternity care should be blamed.In a recentWorld Health Organization analysis, the largest influence on the rate of haemorrhage was caesarean birth, and the only two factors that reduced the haemorrhage risk were home birth and early skin-to-skin contact/breastfeeding. Increased rates of haemorrhage are a natural consequence of high caesarean section rates. Sensationalist quotes of the “terrifying” risk to mothers of haemorrhage will only make the problem worse, as women seek to avoid labour in the NHS, either by choosing a caesarean (which increases the risk of haemorrhage) or by opting out of maternity care altogether (which increases the risk of death if haemorrhage occurs).Increased intervention in childbirth has largely been to protect the baby. And yet, for the baby, childbirth in the UK is safer than it has ever been, with record low rates of stillbirth and neonatal death.A large cultural change is rightly under way in theNHS, with a move away from paternalistic care and towards increased choice for women. We are hearing calls for increased caesarean rates and reductions in midwifery-led care, but sadly these will only increase haemorrhage rates. There is no simple way of giving birth – what is needed is expert compassionate care for all, along with high-quality education and maternal choice. But this will not be cheap. Conveyor-belt care is very cost effective – and a shift to true personalised care will take a large increase in resources. It is time for the government to step in to provide this.Prof Andrew WeeksChair, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists postpartum haemorrhage treatment guidelines committee; professor of international maternal health, University of LiverpoolYour article on postpartum haemorrhage overlooks the crucial link between mode of birth and haemorrhage risk. Thelowest risk occurswhen labour begins spontaneously and birth happens without significant intervention. Caesarean sections and induction of labour both significantly increase haemorrhage risk. Rates of intervention are rising sharply, with little improvement in neonatal outcomes, and worsening outcomes for women. The UK caesarean rate in Englandnow stands at 45%, withinductions at 32%, and many women experiencing both in a single birth.Attributing these trends primarily to women being older or heavier explains only a small proportion of the increase, and there is scant evidence that the higher intervention rates improve outcomes for these groups.The continued denigration of midwifery care that supports physiological birth is contributing to poorer outcomes. Continuity of carer with a named midwife is well evidenced to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes, yet this model remains undersupported. Physiological birth, recently dismissed as an “ideology” in some quarters, is promoted by midwives partly because evidence shows it reduces the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. Research consistently demonstrates that planned, supported, midwife-led births have lower haemorrhage rates than hospital births.Maternal wellbeing, including reducing haemorrhage and birth trauma, must be central to any changes arising from thenational maternity and neonatal investigation.Anna MelamedSonia RichardsonMidwives and midwifery lecturers, University of the West of EnglandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Stripping back protections in the name of speed is a false economy that risks lives, reputations and resilience. The UK’s health and safety framework is the backbone of safe and sustainable growth. These regulations have driven a historic decline in workplace fatalities, injuries and ill health. Weakening them would reverse decades of progress and shift enormous costs on to the NHS, employers and taxpayers.Despite the progress,124 people diedin accidents at work in 2024-25. In 2023-24, the estimated annual cost of workplace injuries and new cases of work-related ill health reached £22.9bn. Good regulation allows businesses to thrive without compromising worker health and safety. The idea that deregulation will unlock growth ignores the reality – unsafe work slows projects, causes harm and damages reputations. We urge policymakers to reject calls for health and safety deregulation, and uphold the world-class standards that make Britain a safe, healthy and competitive place to work, trade and invest.Ruth WilkinsonHead of policy and public affairs,Institution of Occupational Safety and HealthHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

For 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.An analysis by the Guardian of men’s World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025, and do not include the1.6% of sellable ticketsfor each game that Fifa recently made available for a fixed $60 price.It’s important to note that Fifa’s dynamic pricing model could see prices for any game fluctuate between now and the tournament. In some cases, they may drop precipitously, as they did just before some games at the 2025 Club World Cup. But for traveling fans – especially those from thefour countrieswho may face visa restrictions – waiting until the last minute to get tickets may not be desirable or feasible.For now, at the end of 2025 and with the first post-draw phase of ticket sales opening next year, the price rises are most dramatic in the lower categories, greatly raising the barrier for entry for the vast majority of interested fans. This is true across many rounds of the tournament, and especially so for the final.Chart summarizing World Cup ticket price increasesCategory 4 is historically the lowest price point for World Cups, and was previouslyexclusively available to residents of a hosting nation. The home-town discount was most prominent in 2018, with the lowest prices of the 21st century helping provide Russia with a historic home-field advantage as it reached its first quarter-final since 1970 (as the USSR).In 2026, not only are the “cheap seats” at least three times pricier in most rounds than they were when Qatar hosted in 2022, there were so few Category 4 seats available that the whole tournament’s inventory sold out before sales opened to the general public, perFifa.The most extreme of the price rises are concentrated where you think they might be: in the cities and for the games that carry the most importance, or those involving a host country.Graphic of the 2026 World Cup’s most expensive ticketsHistorically, most World Cup rounds have been priced more expensively than the ones before, with the exception of the third-place match being priced akin to a round-of-16 clash or a quarter-final. That’s true again in 2026. Meanwhile, the nascent round of 32 born from an expanded field is priced similarly to group games.The limited number of $60 seatsat every game with prices capped still represents a five-fold increase over 2022’s Category 4 group-stage entry point.Chart showing the change in price of World Cup finalsDynamic pricing, introduced for this tournament, has been cited as the primary driver of these price increases. The practice allows prices for each game to change based on demand, and that demand has changed markedly since the World Cup draw. Before that point, every game had unknown participants except the nine involving host nations. Afterward, teams were assigned matchups and venues, so people for the first time knew who would be playing.Here, the power of global stars becomes apparent. Compared with pre-draw ticket prices for each of their group games, Portugal saw the steepest price increases – which can be chalked up to the Cristiano Ronaldo factor. Lionel Messi’s World Cup-holding Argentina come in second. Euro 2024 champion Spain and well-supported South American qualifiers Colombia and Uruguay round out the top five.Notably, matches involving Iran were the only ones to see a double-digit percentage decrease.The percentages listed below reflect the post-draw pricing compared with initial pricing for each match as specified by its date and venue.Table of the change in World Cup team’s ticket prices after the drawIn total, 91 of the 104 matches saw price increases after December’s draw. Five matches saw their price points go unchanged; eight games saw decreases.No matter what you end up paying, it’s likely going to be a far cry from the pricing model promised during the bid process in 2018, held during Donald Trump’s first term. This is fromthe bid book submitted to Fifa:View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fifa; United 2026 Bid BookAt the time, the United 2026 organizers strove to start group-game pricing for Category 4 at $21 – within a dollar of 2018’s welcoming price when accounting for inflation. The recent $60 tickets released are still above the planned rates up until the quarter-final stage.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaWorld CupFootball politicsUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Didn’t really know what to say half the time. I suppose playing darts just brought me out of my shell. When you get popular, people want to meet you and talk. It’s matured me.”Greaves was 18 the first time she won the Lakeside women’s world championship, thrusting herself firmly into the crosshairs of public adulation. And even if she played like a natural-born star, with her beautiful fluid throwing arc, she didn’t always feel like one. Endless interviews, viral fame, global domination: this was never what she had craved from the sport. She was Beau, and she just wanted to throw.A lot has altered in the intervening time, but one important thing has not. Greaves remains utterly dominant in the women’s game, more so than anyone who came before her or anyone who is likely to come in future. Her unbroken run of wins on the ProfessionalDartsCorporation Women’s Series stands at 86. In an era of rising standards and ever fiercer competition, Greaves remains ridiculously, outrageously clear of the pack.Quick GuideVan Gerwen survives scare after Kenyan vet Munyua neuters 18th seedShowThe three-time PDC World Darts champion Michael van Gerwen scraped through the opening round at Alexandra Palace, with his 3-1 victory over Mitsuhiko Tatsunami not telling the real story.The Japanese player threatened a shock as he had the darts to go 2-0 up. Van Gerwen looked like he had steadied the ship, but the 52-year-old Tatsunami rallied and had darts to send it to a deciding set before falling to defeat.The Kenyan debutant David Munyua created one of the biggest shocks in the history of the tournament by beating the 18th seed, Mike De Decker.Belgium’s De Decker was last year’s Grand Prix champion in Leicester, putting together an eyecatching run where he beat Michael Smith, Gary Anderson and James Wade before upsetting Luke Humphries, the then world No 1, in the final.However, the 30-year-old Munyua, who is a full-time veterinarian, staged a stunning comeback, roaring back from 2-0 down to 3-2. He became the first Kenyan to win on the Alexandra Palace stage on his first ever visit to London.“It is amazing. I was not expecting it, I am happy about it,” he said during his on-stage interview. “It is a very big moment for the sport itself, for Africa, for Kenya.”De Decker later posted on Instagram congratulating his opponent, but was less complimentary about his treatment from the tournament’s spectators. “The crowd … wow,” he said. “Booing and whistling shouldn’t be something that’s normal or supported. First to complain when it [happens] to UK players in Europe but then doing the exact same thing when the tournament is in the UK.”Another championship debutant, Motomu Sakai, backed up a wacky walk-on routine by cruising into the second round with victory over the Frenchman Thibault Tricole.The 28-year-old Japanese qualifier became an instant cult hero at Alexandra Palace thanks to some exuberant dance moves after high-fiving fans and signing autographs en route to the stage.His eccentric entrance – to the song Ojamajo Carnival – delighted the capacity crowd and was followed by a 3-0 win in which the PDC Asian Tour runner-up averaged 87.38.In round two, Sakai will face Sweden’s Andreas Harrysson, who upset the 12th seed, Ross Smith, last Friday.Elsewhere, Fallon Sharrock’s search for another memorable run ended as she lost 3-0 to Dave Chisnall.Guardian sport and PA MediaPhotograph: Matthew Childs/REUTERSWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But as her legend has grown, so have her horizons. Now 21, she returns to the main world championship for the first time in three years, having refused to play the 2024 and 2025 tournaments in favour of defending her Lakeside women’s titles. The player who once said it was “silly” to think that top female players could ever compete with the top men has beaten Luke Littler and Josh Rock on the tour this year, pushed Michael van Gerwen and Gary Anderson to deciding legs, averaged 94.9 across the season. This time, she means business.View image in fullscreenBeau Greaves has a ‘really tough’ opener against Daryl Gurney, though the bookmakers make her a marginal favourite.Photograph: Chris Sargeant/ProSports/Shutterstock“I’ve changed my perspective on it,” she says. “When I first started playing, I just wanted to be a ladies’ world champion. But I started beating better players, and the penny dropped: I can be good enough to do this full-time.”Exactly how good remains, for now, a matter of some conjecture. Her potential top level is frightening.When she beat Littlerin the semi-finals of the world youth championship in October, she averaged 105. According to the Darts Orakel power rankings, which take into account underlying metrics and strength of opposition, she’s the 22nd best player in the world on form.A sporting superhero: can anyone stop Luke Littler at the world darts championship?Read moreBy the same token, Greaves simply hasn’t played enough big‑stage, high-pressure, long‑format darts for us to be really sure. Most of her games are contested over the best-of-nine legs, with no crowd and against painfully outmatched opposition. Against the very top players, by contrast, elements such as stagecraft and timing, self-belief and killer instinct, intercede.“In the nicest way possible,” she explains, “when I play against the ladies now I can get away with a lot more. If I miss a double, I might have another three or six darts at it. So I need to really nail that part of my game. That’s what I’ve tried to focus on: to make myself as competitive as possible.”Six years ago Fallon Sherrock becamethe first woman to win a matchat the world championship. To date, she’s still the last. “You only get two chances a year to play against the men: the world championship and Grand Slam,” Greaves says. “Which kind of throws you in the deep end a little bit. But more exposure to that level of competition will help.” Already, by virtue of her performances on the development tour, she has secured her tour card for 2026 and 2027.Littler has known her for years and has also noticed the rising ambition in her, driven in part by a change of sponsor in May. “The last few years, she just wasn’t bothered about going to Q-school, getting a tour card,” he says. “But I think Target are pushing her, her manager’s pushing her. And she’s going to cause some damage on that tour next year.”She plays the world No 22, Daryl Gurney, in the Friday night primetime slot: a “really tough” opener, she says, albeit one in which the bookmakers make her a marginal favourite. “I don’t want to get dragged into people expecting too much,” she says. “I want to do stuff on my own terms.”And so what started as a bedroom hobby has turned into a viable career, a way of life, a way of finding her voice. “I always wanted to get a house out of playing darts,” she says. “I still live with my mum and dad, but I’m looking to move out next year. Obviously I’ll stay in Yorkshire, don’t want to be too far from home. But that’s something I’m looking forward to: finally leaving the nest.”Which feels like a pretty good metaphor for Greaves the player: a career on the verge of taking flight, ready for its first great leap. In the long term, the PDC’s goal was always to develop women’s darts to the point where the distinction could eventually be abolished entirely, and Greaves is exactly the sort of player they were envisioning: a talent transcendent enough to smash down the old barriers and throw the doors of the sport wide open.As a girl, Greaves always used to get told she “threw like a bloke”. Perhaps there is a certain irony, then, in the fact that she has done more than anyone to consign the old prejudices to history. “Most of the men aren’t bothered,” she says. “They just refer to me as a darts player, rather than a ladies’ darts player. I definitely think the whole lady-against-the-bloke thing is wearing off now.”View image in fullscreenBeau Greaves says: ‘When I play against the ladies now I can get away with a lot more.

There are mounting concerns for his mental and physical wellbeing, with doctors, commentators and former fighters openly questioning his soundness of mind and wondering whether he might end up in hospital – or worse. The oddsmakers have made him an 8-1 longshot, a price that feels almost charitable given the epic scale of the mismatch. The buildup revolves less around the favorite than around the smaller man’s mouth: his noise, his presence, and the creeping suspicion that spectacle may finally have outrun sense.Cassius Clay wound up shocking the world back in 1964 when hemade Sonny Liston quit on his stoolafter six rounds at the Miami Beach Convention Center. But it’s right here, on the eve of Friday night’s scheduled eight-round showdown between Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua at the nearby Kaseya Center, where those curious rhymes with the past come to a screeching halt.It’s Christmastime on the neon edge of south-east Florida and everything old is new again. Paul, the 28-year-old American who rose to global fame as a YouTuber, has managed to develop into a competent club-level boxer since pivoting to the sport and turning professional in 2020, winning 12 of 13 bouts against a fleet of mostly faded mixed martial arts fighters, fellow YouTubers, a retired basketball star and a 58-year-old Mike Tyson – the last of whichpeaked at 65m live concurrent streamsand drew an estimated 108 million average live viewers worldwide.View image in fullscreenJake Paul’s fight against a 58-year-old Mike Tyson drew an estimated 108 million average live viewers worldwide.Photograph: Kevin Jairaj/USA Today SportsJoshua, 36, is an Olympic gold medallist and two-time unified heavyweight champion with an 89% knockout percentage who launched the first of his title reigns when Paul was still chewing scenery on the Disney Channel. He enters Friday’s main event looking to re-establish himself aftera fifth-round knockout loss to Daniel Duboisin September 2024, and amid continuing discussions about a potential long-awaited bout with his fellow former champion Tyson Fury next year.The contest has raised safety concerns because of the disparity in size, experience and pedigree. Paul weighed just under 200lb in his most recent bout, while Joshua, who stands five inches taller, has competed comfortably above 250lb. Despite criticism from regulators and fighters – there are questions over whether Vegas would have sanctioned it, much less the BritishBoxingBoard of Control – the bout has been rubber-stamped and heavily backed as a global streaming event, with a nine-figure investment from Netflix. Paul and Joshua will each reportedly clear a minimum of $50m (£37.3m) for their efforts.“People don’t like the fact that I’m fighting Jake. Whether that concerns me or not is another question,” Joshua said during Wednesday night’s final press conference, at a theater around the corner from where Ali brought Liston to heel all those years ago. “But if we look at the people that don’t want me to be here, but they want me to put an end to Jake Paul’s show, I understand it and that’s why I have to carry boxing on my back with this fight.”View image in fullscreenMuhammad Ali, or Cassius Clay as he was known at the time, whips a right to the head of a ducking Sonny Liston in Miami Beach in February 1964.Photograph: Anonymous/APFistic puristsmay lament the state of things, but there is no sport better equipped to understand what is happening here. Long before anyone talked about algorithms or engagement metrics, boxing was the original attention economy, its value dictated not by merit or structure but by visibility. There were no league structures, no fixed schedules, no guaranteed paydays. A fight existed only if enough people cared to show up, and the fighters who mattered were the ones who could command a crowd.The earliest stars of the prize ring were not merely champions but attractions. John L Sullivan, Jack Johnson and Jack Dempsey became global celebrities in an age when the concept of celebrity itself was still in utero, their names splashed across front pages and their movements followed by crowds eager to watch them train. Promoters such as Tex Rickard and Doc Kearns refined the model, engineering spectacle through controversy, narrative and scale. Skill mattered, but drawing power mattered more. Fighters who moved the needle advanced; those who did not were left behind. Boxing did not borrow this logic from modern media. It helped create it, convertingviewsdirectly into revenue long before the term existed. Today’s iteration is simply an older logic resurfacing in a louder age.That logic has been on full display throughout a fight week like none other, the firstwith a designated content housewhere a platoon of creators have been cooking since Monday. What was intended as a routine promotional curtain-raiser on Wednesday instead became another reminder of how combustible the buildup has become. Joshua’s blunt framing of boxing as an occupationthat carries the risk of fatal consequencesdrew sharp reaction across the sport, prompting withering criticism from Fury even as he remains a potential future opponent.Joshua v Paul makes Joe Louis’ ‘Bum of the Month’ look like the Rumble in the Jungle | Sean IngleRead morePaul has responded to sceptics in his usual confrontational register. Asked about fighters and critics who argue his bouts are not “real” – that a gentlemen’s agreement might be in play – he dismissed the claim as legally actionable slander, framing the backlash as both a compliment and proof that his presence unsettles the sport. He insisted there were no hit-and-giggle handshakes, no soft landings, and no illusions about what awaits in the ring, portraying Friday’s fight as a genuine confrontation rather than a contrivance. He defended his presence by claiming “no one’s done more for the sport of boxing in the past decade than myself”. He may be right.The consensus among boxing’s chattering class is that it will go as long as Joshua lets it – a couple of rounds if Paul fights merely to survive, a couple of minutes if he fights to win – but it must be noted that a spectacular destruction may only burnish Paul’s brand. He’s spent the week rattling off his many jobs: a venture capitalist, a CEO, a boxer, an entrepreneur. But at heart he remains a YouTuber, that unique subset of celebrity whose defining trait is not being afraid to embarrass themselves on camera in pursuit of that one viral moment. TheOprah shot. There’s little doubt that Christmas will come early for the millions tuning in to watch Paul’s comeuppance, a proof of concept that boxing’s new normal is the same as it ever was.Explore more on these topicsBoxingAnthony JoshuafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A thrilling draw against Finnish side KuPS in their 27th game of the campaign means that they must now contest a two-leg playoff at the end of February after finishing just outside the top eight in theConference Leaguetable.Having selected an entirely different starting lineup including four teenagers from the side wholost to Manchester City at the weekend, the Palace manager saw his second string impress as Christantus Uche gave them a deserved half-time lead.Chelsea told to ‘put up or shut up’ over potential Earl’s Court moveRead moreBut it needed a late equaliser from Justin Devenny to salvage a draw after they conceded two goals in three minutes in the second half, with the Northern Irishman and Eddie Nketiah then coming closest to snatching a victory in injury-time afterKuPShad been reduced to 10 men.It means Palace face a tie against either Bosnian side Zrinjski or Sigma Olomouc of the Czech Republic – a prospect that will at least give their fans the chance to notch up another country on their first European tour.“We wanted to go straight into the last 16 but we knew that this could happen and we have to accept it when we picked this team,” said Glasner, whose side could face nine games in February if they can get past Arsenal in therearranged Carabao Cup quarter-final next week. “We want this schedule and hopefully playing the Carabao Cup final and the FA Cup final as well. Playing 65 games in a season, that’s what we want because it would mean we have been successful.”Glasner also acknowledged that the only drawback to prioritising their Premier League game against Leeds on Saturday night is that their opponents already know their team. But he was delighted with the impact made by teenage defenders George King and Dean Benamar on their debuts, while 16-year-old winger Joel Drakes-Thomas became the fourth youngest player in Palace’s history and looks a real talent.View image in fullscreenChristantus Uche is congratulated by Jaydee Canvot and Justin Devenny after giving Crystal Palace the lead.Photograph: Sebastian Frej/Getty ImagesKuPS, who will also contest the playoffs, must have thought their luck was in when they saw the teamsheets. Managed by former Stockport and Hibernian midfielder Jarkko Wiss, their domestic season finished nearly two months ago when the team from the Finnish Lakeland city of Kuopio that is twinned with Oldham were crowned champions for a second year in a row.But any thoughts KuPS may have had that Palace’s young side would simply roll over were dispelled inside the first five minutes. Uche started the move when he exchanged passes with Borna Sosa before deceiving his marker and effortlessly curling a shot into the far corner with the outside of his right foot. There were gasps when the goal was replayed on the big screen, such was its quality. The Nigeria striker could have had more in the first half after Drakes-Thomas hustled the KuPS defence into a mistake, although there were a few worried faces on the Palace bench when he went down clutching his knee before being able to continue.King, who plays for the Republic of Ireland’s Under-19s and has been a regular for Palace’s Under-21s this season, looked assured on the right of the back three, while Benamar was a lively presence down the left. Romain Esse went closest to extending Palace’s lead but screwed his shot wide before being booked for a crude tackle on Jaakko Oksanen that infuriated Glasner. KuPS failed even to register a shot on target before the break while a clever backheel from Esse almost set up Uche for another chance.Whatever Wiss said to his players at half-time clearly had the desired effect. A break instigated by Otto Ruoppi allowed Saku Savolainen to set up Piotr Parzyszek for the equaliser and they went ahead two minutes later when Ibrahim Cissé diverted a shot from Clinton Antwi past Walter Benítez. It could have been even worse for Palace had Parzyszek not had another goal ruled out because Petteri Pennanen was offside in the buildup.Glasner introduced Marc Guéhi, Tyrick Mitchell and Will Hughes from the bench in a bid to change the momentum but Palace still struggled to mount a response. They were given a lifeline when Antwi was sent off for an awful studs-up challenge on Hughes that prompted the Israeli referee to immediately brandish his red card.Devenny took advantage when he headed in Mitchell’s cross to set up a grandstand finale, even if Palace could not quite find a winner.Explore more on these topicsConference LeagueCrystal PalaceKuPSmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 2022 World Cup in Qatar operated with eight stadiums, although after the expansion to 48 teams next year’s tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada will have 16 venues.Saudi Arabia unveiled plans based around four cities – Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar and Abha – and Neom Stadium, which is due to be built in the yet-to-be-constructed futuristic mega-project known as The Line, a 500-metre-high city to be powered by renewable energy.Eleven new venues are planned, with four stadiums to be renovated and expanded. Several of the new stadiums are being designed by the UK-based companies Foster + Partners and Arup, and the American firm Populous is also heavily involved.The construction of three venues has begun, but industry sources have told the Guardian a number of the stadium builds are facing delays. Several architecture firms have been asked to resubmit tenders or reduce costs owing to a slowdown in spending by PIF linked to lower oil prices.View image in fullscreenThe design of Murabba Stadium in Riyadh.Photograph: Saudi2034One company is understood to have been told it could lose its stadium contract if it does not produce significant cost savings.PIF regards the situation as business as usual with many key decisions still to be made with nine years remaining before the World Cup. The tournament is expected to take place in November and December 2034.Nearly all of Saudi’s capital infrastructure projects come under crown prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 development drive, which was announced in 2016 to move the country away from reliance on oil and towards other industries, particularly tourism, hospitality and property.Vision 2030 is financed by PIF, which remains heavily reliant on the nation’s vast oil and gas reserves. Saudi Arabia’s state oil company Aramco reduced its prices this month because of falling demand and an oversupply among Opec, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.PIF announced plans in April to cut spending by at least 20% in 2025, with mega-projects such as Neom and other huge entertainment and tourism developments at Qiddiya City and Diriyah initially feeling the pinch.A Saudi source confirmed that although spending on sport would be prioritised some World Cup projects were likely to be affected. PIF is also the majority owner of Newcastle United and four Saudi Pro League clubs.The Saudi Arabian Football Federation was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2034Saudi Arabia and sportWorld CupnewsShareReuse this content"

But we should not be afraid of threats – we should be afraid of Europe being weak.”View image in fullscreenZelenskyy speaking during to EU leaders at the summit.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesEU leaders have been presented with two options to meet Ukraine’s estimated €136bn funding needs in 2026 and 2027: a “reparations loan” secured against Russian frozen assets or joint EU borrowing to fund Kyiv. The European Commission, which proposed the €90bn loan, expects Ukraine’s other western allies to make up the rest.Germany and other frugal countries, such as Sweden and the Netherlands, strongly support tapping Russian assets, rather than European taxpayers. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said the reparations loan was the only option. “We are basically faced with the choice of using European debt or Russian assets for Ukraine, and my opinion is clear: We must use the Russian assets.”What is the row about the EU using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine?Read moreBut Belgium, which hosts most of the Russian assets, said it had not received adequate guarantees from the rest of the EU if the scheme went wrong. “Give me a parachute and we’ll all jump together,” Belgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, told members of the Belgian parliament before the summit began. “If we have confidence in the parachute that shouldn’t be a problem.Belgium has pressed for unlimited guarantees that mean it would not be left alone with the bill should Russia succeed in retaliatory legal claims against Euroclear or Belgian companies.A draft summit text presented on Thursday pledged “full solidarity” and risk-sharing with countries and financial institutions in the context of the reparations loan. But the text seen by the Guardian was scant on details sought by Belgium, such as how quickly guarantees would materialise, or how long they would last.The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, on a visit to Athens, stressed the importance of “mobilising” Russia’s frozen assets, saying it was clear Moscow was still bent on waging its war of aggression in Ukraine.“I see two presidents who are pursuing peace at the moment, President Trump and President Zelenskyy, and one president, President Putin, who is still seeking to escalate conflict and war,” she said. “That is why it is so important to make progress on mobilising the Russian sovereign assets in order to be able to support Ukraine and also to be able to put increased pressure on Russia to properly bring them to the table and pursue peace.”View image in fullscreenYvette Cooper at a press conference in Athens.Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/ReutersRussia’s central bank announced on Thursday that it would pursue damages against European banks “for the illegal blocking and use of its assets”, after its claim for$230bn in damages from Euroclear. Euroclear, the Brussels depository where €185bn Russian assets are parked, has beensubject to an intimidation campaign, security officials told the Guardian.Zelenskyy said he had had “a good conversation” with De Wever during a one-on-one meeting, but that his country faced bigger risks. “One can fear certain legal steps in court from the Russian Federation but it is not as scary as when Russia is at your borders.”In an impassioned speech to EU leaders he urged them to agree the reparations loan on strategic and self-interest grounds. He said much of the funds would be spent on European weapons, while stressing Ukraine also needed some equipment not available in Europe, such as US missile defence systems.Alongside Belgium, Italy, Malta and Bulgaria favour an EU loan, secured against unallocated funds in the EU budget. Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has said using Russia’s assets frozen in Europe to help Ukraine without a solid legal basis would hand Moscow “the first victory since the start of the war”.But common borrowing requires unanimity of the 27 member states. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has slammed using Russia’s frozen assets as a “stupid” idea, while also announcing his veto to joint debt “to finance a war that isn’t our’s”The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he was confident leaders would find a solution. “We are going to find a technical solution, therefore we must not be divided over technical details. Everyone must be listened and heard.”The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she would not leave the summit without a solution. The meeting is scheduled to finish on Friday.The talks are unfolding against a separate diplomatic dance orchestrated by the Trump administration,which is seeking to negotiate a deal to end the war. US and Russian officials are expected to meet in Miami this weekend to discuss Trump’s peace plan, a White House official told AFP on Wednesday.Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner are expected to take part on the US side, while Putin’s economic envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, will represent Russia,Politico reported.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The number of people seeking treatment is rising significantly and on average patients are already waiting five years and seven months for a first assessment.The review conducted by Dr David Levy, an NHS medical director and cancer specialist, was commissioned after last year’s Cass report on gender care for children and young people.Levy, an NHS medical director and cancer specialist, took a team to nine NHS England clinics to assess the effectiveness and safety of each service, interviewing staff and patients.His report found that the clinics’ failure to study outcomes for their patients made it impossible to judge the safety of these services.“It is unacceptable that there is no outcomes data to support or guide patients, clinicians and commissioners in understanding which treatments and interventions may deliver the best outcomes for patients,” the review said.Long waiting lists were also leading to safety issues, driving people to self-source hormone drugs from high-risk online providers abroad. By the time patients were seen by clinicians, staff said it was often challenging to provide appropriate support because in the interim patients had sought information and support online, some of which may have been inaccurate, the report noted.Aside from the detailed information about waiting times there was “virtually no other data” available from the adult clinics, Levy wrote, making it impossible to analyse how patients responded to a range of treatments, from prescription of cross-sex hormones to psychological support. The adult clinics can refer patients for surgical interventions, but this is provided by a separate NHS service, which was not reviewed by the team.The review heard that some patients expressed regret and dissatisfaction after treatment, and a smaller number later chose to reverse their gender transition, but it was impossible to estimate what proportion later detransitioned because of the absence of outcomes data.“These services need robust, high-quality research. While the review heard that some GDCs were involved in national or international research projects, little evidence was shared before or during the review visits,” the report found. Clinicians told the review team that it was challenging to undertake clinical audits on a population “that may feel vulnerable and mistrustful about how data is held and used”.In her report of last year,Dr Hilary Cass notedthat she had been approached by a number of staff members working in adult clinics who were concerned by “out of control” waiting lists and inconsistent standards in the services.The profile of people seeking help has changed significantly, shifting from a predominantly older to a predominantly younger age group of patients; the majority (57%) of referrals are now for those aged between 18 and 25 years old. The population has also shifted from mostly birth-registered males to a more even ratio of birth-registered females, but getting precise data was difficult because not all clinics recorded sex at birth, using patient-reported gender instead, the report noted.The review was told that the growing younger cohort of patients had a higher proportion of additional neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder, and a broader range of other issues, such as mental health conditions, trauma or abuse during childhood, compared with patients referred in the past.Only 31.5% of patients were discharged having completed their treatment, raising questions about why patients were not continuing to attend or could not be contacted, the review team found. “This should be an early priority for a national audit,” the report said.“Gender service provision is an area where there are strongly held views about how care should be delivered and who should provide it. These services have to navigate this challenging landscape, where debate is often hostile and polarised, while continuing to provide patient care,” the report noted.The review team heard from some staff members that they were not encouraged to raise concerns in team meetings, and “felt clinical curiosity or constructive challenge was discouraged” and that “issues raised were dismissed as transphobia or prejudice”. This atmosphere was not felt in all clinics, the review found, with some workplaces encouraging staff contributions.Prof James Palmer, national medical director for specialised services, said: “Too many people are waiting far too long to get care, experiences of care are variable, and we need to ensure care is equitable wherever patients live. We have already begun to take action to improve adult gender services by increasing investment and opening more clinics to help bring down long waits but we will use the recommendations in this report to further improve services across the NHS.” The funding available for non-surgical gender care more than doubled from £16m in 2020-21 to £36m in 2024-25Levy made 20 recommendations, including a requirement that clinics nationally begin reporting outcomes data that include patients’ birth-registered sex. From January he will chair a new national improvement programme for adult gender services.The campaign group TransActual welcomed recommendations “for a more streamlined, patient centred care pathway”, but raised concerns about the proposed ending of self-referrals and said requiring a first assessment to be done by a senior clinician risked “unnecessarily hampering efforts to reduce waiting times”.Explore more on these topicsNHSTransgenderGenderYoung peopleEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

He said No 10 would instead hold “occasional” afternoon press conferences with ministers, as well as technical briefings with officials.He said the morning lobby briefing would continue but would sometimes be replaced by a press conference with ministers, or possibly Keir Starmer, the prime minister, “setting out the main government announcements of the day”. These would be open to specialist journalists and social media content creators.Held inside 9 Downing Street, lobby briefings are on the record but not broadcast, and journalists can ask as many questions as they want, and on any topic. Government press conferences, in contrast, tend to have a limited number of questions from selected journalists.The reduction in scrutiny was criticised by the organisation representing lobby journalists. David Hughes, from PA News, and Lizzy Buchan, from the Mirror, the outgoing and incoming lobby chairs, said in a joint statement: “We are greatly concerned by this step and furious that the lobby was not consulted about this move which restricts access and, we fear, scrutiny.“Downing Street has promised more ministerial press conferences but they will obviously control the timetable for those and will no doubt seek to choose who they take questions from. None of this bodes well for transparency from a government which came into office promising to raise standards.”In his email, Allan said the media landscape had been “utterly transformed”, leaving the current arrangements “not fit for purpose”.He said: “The afternoon lobby has become very sparsely attended. It often repeats lines given at the morning lobby or repeats government lines on stories which are freely available elsewhere. It is not a good use of journalists’ time, or a good use of our communications resources.“Instead of afternoon lobby, we will commence occasional afternoon press conferences with ministers in No 9 Downing Street. These will start with the minister setting out a new announcement from the government and taking questions on it.”Allan added: “We will be instigating a series of morning press conferences in No 9 Downing Street with ministers, and occasionally the prime minister setting out the main government announcements of the day. These will be open to the lobby, to sector journalists and to content creators. When such press conferences occur, there will not be a lobby briefing that day.”Kemi Badenoch said a future Tory government would restore the afternoon briefings. The Conservative leader said: “Keir Starmer is running scared. This is aLabourgovernment that hates scrutiny and blames everyone else for its failings.”A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: “The government will not improve its ability to communicate with the public by drastically reducing transparency and the media’s daily access. Updating how it communicates to better reach people is vital, but that can’t be done at the expense of scrutiny and accountability.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsLabourDaily MirrorNewspapers & magazinesPress freedomPress AssociationNews agenciesnewsShareReuse this content"

Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.”The name change is the culmination of an aggressive effort by the Trump administration to remake the US capital’s arts and culture institutions more to its liking. The Kennedy Center confirmed the vote to change the namein an email to the Washington Post.Joe Kennedy III, grandnephew of the former president who also served a congressman for Massachusetts, said he doubted the center’s name could legally be changed.“The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law. It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,Kennedy III posted to X.Earlier this year, House Republicans proposed changing the name of the Kennedy Center’s Opera House to the “First Lady Melania Trump Opera House”. It has also ordered a review of the Smithsonian Institution and is seeking to build a huge ballroom adjacent to the White House. That ballroom takes the place of the East Wing, which was demolished over the summer.Kennedy Center ticket sales fall to lowest in years after Trump’s takeoverRead moreCritics of the Kennedy Center name changes have pointed to afederal statuteestablishing the center that says “the Board shall assure that after December 2, 1983, no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F.

The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation,” Trump said, adding in capitals, “the best is yet to come.”Earlier this month, the center honored a hand-selected list of contributors to the nation’s cultural output. Trump served as the evening’s compere. They included the country singer George Strait; Broadway actor Michael Crawford, best known for The Phantom of the Opera; actor Sylvester Stallone; and disco singer Gloria Gaynor.When he announced the honorees in August, Trump said he was “very involved” in selecting the group. Past recipients of the center’s lifetime achievement awards include Stephen Sondheim, Yo-Yo Ma, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Johnny Cash, Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, LL Cool J, Francis Ford Coppola and the Grateful Dead.The US congresswoman Joyce Beattyposted on Xthat the decision to rename the institution as the Trump-Kennedy Center was not unanimous. Beatty serves as an ex-officio member of the center.“For the record. This was not unanimous,” she said. “I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move.” Beatty called the center’s renaming a “just another attempt to evade the law and not have the people have a say”.This article was amended on 18 December 2025. An earlier version referred to Joe Kennedy III as JFK’s grandson rather than his grandnephew.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

In September last year, a man impersonating a police officer tried a similar trick over the phone against the pensioner and demanded more than €60,000 in cash.“Then, too, he and his daughter reacted in an exemplary manner, which also led to the arrest of a courier,” police said.When the 40-year-old woman arrived to pick up the bundle at the handover site, police were waiting.In both cases, the scammers claimed the money was needed as bail for a relative after a fatal car accident. Last year, the callers named his niece as the accused and, in the most recent case, a granddaughter.Police warned potential victims, particularly elderly people, to be sceptical of similar calls and urged them not to reveal personal data, including bank details.Earlier this month, a Munich woman in her 80s gave cash and gold valued at up to €600,000 to swindlers after receiving a phone call from a “female doctor” claiming that a family member urgently needed expensive medication she should pay for by courier.A 24-year-old man arrived to claim the money and the gold while a 59-year-old accomplice waited for him in a nearby car. Police arrested both at the scene and returned the valuables to the woman. It was not immediately clear who alerted the authorities.In July, criminals cheated an 80-year-old Ingolstadt man out of more than €100,000 in gold. Warning of a rash of burglaries in the region, a caller claiming to be a police officer told the victim to place his gold bars on the doorstep of his home for pickup so they could be taken to a safe location. He complied and the valuables were stolen.Earlier in the day, a caller pretending to be a bank employee had called the 80-year-old man telling him his account had been compromised by thieves and he should make a series of payments to rectify the problem. The victim made several transfers, each involving thousands of euros.Explore more on these topicsGermanyScamsEuropeOlder peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Another scenario sees a plunge of 6C in temperature after the collapse of key Atlantic Ocean currents, massively disrupting farming and energy needs.The impacts, some of which are linked toclimate tipping points, are seen as low probability but plausible. The researchers said the scenarios filled a gap in forecasting that had left the UK unprepared for extreme outcomes.A second set of worst-case scenarios sets out the potential extent of extreme weather between now and the end of the century. These indicate that temperatures could soar in some months by up to 6C above average, while rainfall could be triple normal levels.“The climate extremes we have mapped aren’t predictions, but they are plausible,” said Nigel Arnell, a University of Reading professor who led the study. “The UK has been planning without the tools to test against worst-case scenarios. We’ve now given decision-makers what they need to prepare for climate outcomes they hope never happen, but can’t afford to ignore.”The probability of the extreme scenarios happening could not be calculated because of uncertainty about what action will be taken to tackle global heating and how the climate system will respond. Arnell said this made the analysis similar to national security risk assessments or the Bank of England’s stress tests for the financial system.“You couldn’t have known what the probability of Russia invading Ukraine was, but you could have said this is what the consequences might be,” he added.The worst-case scenarios could be used to inform the building of long-term infrastructure, such as new towns, nuclear power stations and urban drainage systems, Arnell said, adding that awareness of climate risks could speed the drive to cut fossil fuel emissions.Published in the journal Earth’s Future, the analysis developed the worst-case scenarios using a combination of observed and historical experience, computer simulations and theory.Global temperatures rising well above 4C by 2100 could happen if climate action collapses or if there are strong feedback loops such as the Amazon rainforest dying and releasing its enormous store of carbon. This would result in extreme and prolonged heatwaves and droughts hitting the UK in summer. Thousands of early deaths have already occurred in England in heatwaves with just a 1.3C increase in global temperatures.Temperatures could also be driven up by about 0.75C if pollution from industry is sharply cut, the scientists said. This is because aerosol particles from burning coal and heavy fuels block sunlight from reaching the ground.A major ocean current, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(Amoc) is weakeningand losing stability because of global heating. It is one of the tipping points that most concerns scientists. A collapse beginning in 2030 would lead to 6C cooling in the UK.“Agriculture would struggle enormously and water resources would be completely altered,” said Arnell. “Our heat and energy system would be completely caught out by changing winter energy demand. It wouldn’t happen overnight, but it would be massively disruptive.”A collapse of even one part of Amoc, the sub-polar gyre, would reduce UK temperatures by 2.5C, the scientists said.Global sea levels are already higher because of global heating but a rise of 2.0-2.2 metres around the UK by 2100 could occur if glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica collapse rapidly, flooding coastal cities and towns. Unlike the other scenarios, this possibility was already known to planners.The worst-case scenarios do not take into account potential global problems including the devastation of food supplies and conflict.The research was commissioned by the Met Office as part of the government’s climate resilience programme. A House of Lords reportwarned in 2021that not enough attention was being given to low‐likelihood but high‐impact risks.The Climate Change Committee, the government’s independent advisory body, has said the UKneeds to “adapt to 2Cand assess the risks for 4C”. Adaptation plans published in 2023 werecriticised as being “very weak”.A government spokesperson said: “Climate change is at the heart of this government’s agenda, both adapting for the future and becoming a clean energy superpower. It is vital that the UK is ready for the impacts and we are helping local communities become more resilient, including by building nine new reservoirs, as well as a record £10.5bn in government funding for new flood defences to protect nearly 900,000 properties by 2036.”The government has requested an evidence review of climate risks from the CCC, which will be published in the spring. It has also asked for guidance on climate scenarios to be used in planning.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisExtreme heatExtreme weatherDroughtFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

But early warning signs have arrived as crop yield rates flatline, prompting warnings of efficiency hitting its limits and the impacts of climate change taking effect.At first glance trends seem positive. Farming methods have become more and more efficient over the last 80 years.However, multiple projections suggest that climate change will soon have key crops plateauing, then sliding down again. The chart shows how crop yields could fall over the rest of the century under a high-emissions scenario.The effects of climate change are predicted to reduce the yields of all of these key crops. This modelling only takes into account forecasts for climate change and income growth, and does not account for other factors that may limit this effect or boost yields, such as technological innovations or land use changes.Meanwhile, the world’s population is expected to grow by a further 2 billion by the end of the century.Experts have warned that, under high-emission scenarios, future crop yields could decrease by a quarter.This is largely because of extreme weather events wreaking havoc on agriculture. In just the last two years, increasing extremes seen with“global weirding”have had an impact on agriculture, with wild fluctuations in rainfall attributed to a number of record low yields.The map below shows some extreme weather events between 2023 and 2024, and how they are imperilling our ability to grow food.% change monthly rainfallDrierWetter-1000≥+100Changes relative to long-term monthly average between 1991 and 2020Efficiency masks a growing problemExtreme weather events pose a major threat to food security around the world.This map shows how rainfall cycles in the last couple of years have changed compared with the 1991-2020 average.Some places have been hit by rainfall at twice the normal rate, whereas other usually wet places record months with barely any rain. This has led to harvest yields in disarray.Record rainfall in eastern ChinaJune-August 2023At least 16 cities and provinces across eastern China faced record rainfall and flooding between June and August in 2023. Tens of thousands of hectares of crops were damaged or destroyed.A man wades through a flooded corn farm after the rains and floods brought by remnants of Typhoon Doksuri, in Hebei province, China.

The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit predicted farmers could lose £600m on wheat, winter and spring barley, oats and oilseed rape. Wine harvests were down by as much as 75% in some regions.Brussels sprouts being harvested in a flooded field, Boston, Lincolnshire. January 2024.

Thousands of hectares faced harvest failure in Indonesia, while nearly 600,000 tonnes of rough rice crops were lost in the Philippines.A global issueThe case studies covered are a fraction of the picture. FromAustraliatoPortugaltoPuerto RicotoIndia, extreme weather events are affecting crop yields across the world, with the impacts rippling out to supply chains, industry and people.The relationship between climate and food security is complex. Not all crops are used for food, and phenomena such asEl Niñocan complicate longer-term trends. However, the relationship between extreme weather events and low harvests is clear.Maize, the world’s most produced crop, stands to be hit especially hard. Yield by the end of the century is projected to drop by 6% in a low-warming scenario, and as much as 24% in extreme scenarios.Andrew Hultgren, an assistant professor of agricultural and consumer economics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said: “Climate change and weather extremes will drive down global caloric yields by about 24% under high future emissions.“This would result in higher food prices, which in rich countries would feel like inflation. In poor countries, this would exacerbate food security problems and could negatively affect political stability.”More than 600 million people worldwide are projected to face food insecurity – or worse – by 2030. Increasingly erratic climates will only make the situation worse unless action is taken.Kaveh Zahedi, the director of the office of climate change, biodiversity and environment at theFoodand Agriculture Organization (FAO), said: “Global averages mask a huge amount of chaos that lies underneath. What you see is unpredictability.”To tackle these challenges, experts point to meeting climate goals, building resilience in food systems and cutting food waste. The FAO advocates for initiatives such assmarter rice cultivationandrestoring degraded agricultural land.“Sustainability writ large is a part of that solution,” Zahedi said. “It has to be about resilience. It has to be about expanding farmer incomes. It has to be about making sure that you have nutritious food. It has to be about access and affordability. All of this comes into play.”Seven times size of Manhattan: the African tree-planting project making a differenceRead moreHultgren added: “Producers in many major breadbaskets [would be] harmed by warming, as are poor subsistence growers in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Oceania. Losses to major breadbaskets drive overall losses to global caloric output. Losses to poor subsistence farmers are particularly concerning from a food security perspective … as they face increased risks of family malnutrition and starvation after a bad harvest.“One of the best things we can do is cut emissions. Going from high warming to more moderate warming cuts global caloric yield losses by half. That helps everyone – from breadbasket farmers to developed-world consumers to the global poor.”MethodologyThis reporting uses theClimate Data Storeof the Copernicus Climate Change Service.

He claimed they were the first attempt to measure the specific effect of artificial intelligence rather than datacentres in general as the use of chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini soared in 2025.The figures show the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from AI use are also now equivalent to more than 8% of global aviation emissions. His study used technology companies’ own reporting and he called for stricter requirements for them to be more transparent about their climate impact.“The environmental cost of this is pretty huge in absolute terms,” he said. “At the moment society is paying for these costs, not the tech companies. The question is: is that fair? If they are reaping the benefits of this technology, why should they not be paying some of the costs?”De Vries-Gao found that the 2025 carbon footprint of AI systems could be as high as 80m tonnes, while the water used could reach 765bn litres. He said it was the first time AI’s water impact had been estimated and showed that AI water use alone was more than a third higher than previous estimates of all datacentre water use.More than 200 environmental groups demand halt to new US datacentersRead moreThe figures are published in the academic journal Patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA)saidearlier this year that AI-focused datacentres draw as much electricity as power-thirsty aluminium smelters and datacentre electricity consumption is expected to more than double by 2030.“This is yet more evidence that the public is footing the environmental bill for some of the richest companies on Earth,” said Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a UK non-profit that campaigns for fairness in tech. “Worse, it is likely just the tip of the iceberg. The datacentre construction frenzy, driven by generative AI, is only getting started.“Just one of these new ‘hyperscale’ facilities can generate climate emissions equivalent to several international airports. And in the UK alone, there are an estimated 100-200 of them in the planning system.”The IEA has reported that the largest AI-focused datacentres being built today will each consume as much electricity as 2m households with the US accounting for the largest share of datacentre electricity consumption (45%) followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%).The largest datacentre being planned in theUK, at a former coal power station site in Blyth, Northumberland, is expected to emit more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when at full operation – the equivalent to the amount produced by more than 24,000 homes.Thirsty work: how the rise of massive datacentres strains Australia’s drinking water supplyRead moreIn India, where $30bn (£22.5bn) is being invested in datacentres, there are growing concerns that a lack of reliability from the National Grid will mean the construction of huge diesel generator farms for backup power, which the consultancy KPMG this weekcalled“a massive … carbon liability”.Technology companies’ environmentaldisclosuresare often insufficient to assess even the total datacentre impact, never mind isolating AI use, said De Vries-Gao. He noted that when Google recently reported on the impact of its Gemini AI, it did not account for the water used in generating the electricity needed to power it.Google reported that in 2024 it managed to reduce energy emissions from its datacentres by 12% due to new clean energy sources, but itsaidthis summer that achieving its climate goals was “now more complex and challenging across every level – from local to global” and “a key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale”.Google was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)WaterGreenhouse gas emissionsComputingEnergyGoogleChatGPTnewsShareReuse this content"

By the time anyone realised what was going on, it was too late. The power of some heat exchangers had dropped by a third, blocked with ground-up shells.The air conditioning faltered, and buildings that should have been less than 24C in the summer heat couldn’t get below 26 to 27C. The invasive mollusc had infiltrated pipes that suck cold water from a depth of 75 metres (250ft) in Lake Geneva to cool buildings. “It’s an open invasion,” says Mathurin Dupanier, utilities operations manager at EPFL.But the damage went far beyond keeping classrooms cool. The university’s datacentres need to be chilled, and long-running experiments cannot tolerate temperature fluctuations. “Research is one of the things we do; if it stops, then the school closes,” says Dupanier. The institute is also home to Tokamak – an experimental nuclear fusion facility that looks to create clean energy from the same process that powers the sun. That, too, needs to be cooled – otherwise it will melt.‘We were in denial’Quagga mussels are among the planet’s most potent invasive species. They reproduce at astonishing speed: one female quagga produces up toa million egg cells. Some are known to survive for 30 years in the deepest parts of American lakes. They can breed all year round, and spawn in temperatures as low as 5C.Dupanier’s team were shocked when they discovered the extent of the invasion in 2022. “We had this denial about what was happening,” he says. The quaggas had only been detected in Lake Genevasix years previouslyand already they had spread like wildfire.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenMathurin Dupanier indicates the water cooling systems that were blocked by the invasive quagga mussels. Photographs: Phoebe Weston/the Guardian; École Polytechnique Fédérale de LausanneThe threats to pieces of infrastructure such as Tokamak illustrate the possible scope of their impact. Losing air cooling there will not result in a nuclear explosion, but equipment will go into shutdown. Now, any activity that uses cold water from the depths of the lake is at risk. Drinking water in Geneva and Lausanne is potentially threatened because the pumping and filtration systems are in the quagga zone. The airport – which uses the same water cooling system as the university – has also been hit. “All of them have this issue around the lake; there is no exception,” says Dupanier.Every spot is taken. Instead of seeing sand you see quagga musselsBastiaan IbelingsThe only way for EPFL and the University of Lausanne to protect their pipes is to build a new closed-loop, quagga-free cooling system. Construction will start in 2027 and should take five years. Dupanier says it will be a race against time to keep precious research going before the quaggas choke their systems any further.‘It’s a meadow of quaggas’From a floating research station on Lake Geneva, the lake looks as it always has, with snow-capped mountains tumbling into its dark waters. Over the past decade, however, ecologists know this lake has changed profoundly. “The surface is just a tiny part of the 300 metres below us,” says Bastiaan Ibelings, a professor in ecology at the University of Geneva.View image in fullscreenBastiaan Ibelings, professor of microbial ecology at the University of GenevaView image in fullscreenA chain hauled from beneath Lake Geneva is covered in invasive quagga mussels. Photographs: Jordi Ruiz Cirera/the GuardianTo illustrate the extent of the changes, technicians pull a chain up from the depths. It is encrusted in quagga mussels, like diamonds on gaudy costume jewellery. The base of the food chain that feeds this entire ecosystem has completely changed: snails, shrimps and native mussels that you might have found previously are nowhere to be seen. Even after 100 metres of chain, quaggas are still being hauled out of the water.“It is too late for this lake,” says Ibelings. “It’s like a meadow of quaggas down there. Every spot is taken. Instead of seeing sand you see quagga mussels.”In Lake Geneva the molluscs have reached a record-breaking depth of 250 metres – a pitch-dark environment where there is almost no oxygen, home to scant life other than microbes. Their ability to survive where other species can’t means they grow uncontrollably in Alpine lakes.From sewage and scum to swimming in ‘blue gold’: how Switzerland transformed its riversRead moreFor a long time, the invasion was not very visible to the public, says Ibelings, but now people are noticing something is not right. Dead mussels wash up on beaches, and people can’t walk barefoot because they cut themselves. Recreational boaters have to scrape them off their craft every few months. Crayfish are covered in mussels and dying because they can’t move.100% of samplesQuaggas originate from the Ponto-Caspian region of the Black Sea and were spread around the worldvia shipping routes. They invaded North America’s Great Lakes in 1989 and are now the dominant life form, making upmore than 99%of all invertebrate biomass in some lakes.In the US, they have driven a collapse in the region’s fish populations, with lawmakers warning they will need$500m (£375m) in federal fundingto address the issue. Great Lake shipwrecks – preserved in pristine condition for more than 100 years – are nowcoated in quaggas.This week, they were detected in Northern Ireland for the first time, with the country’s environment minister, Andrew Muir, warning that “increased vigilance and surveillance” was critical.View image in fullscreenQuagga mussels cover the wreck of Kyle Spangler in Thunder Bay national marine sanctuary on Lake Huron in Michigan, US. Photograph: Joseph Hoyt/NOAAThe mussels were first detected in Switzerland in 2014. The highest density was found in Lake Geneva, with an average of 4,000 quagga mussels a square metre across the whole lake. In some places there were more than 35,000 a square metre. In 2022, researchers found 98.9% of samples were quagga mussels, andin a 2024survey, they exclusively scooped up quagga mussels – nothing else. “Quaggas were 100% of samples,” says Salomé Boudet, a PhD student at the University of Geneva, who led the study. Mussel biomass in Lake Geneva is now comparable to what has been found in the Great Lakes, researchers say.Globally, invasive species such as these are one of the five main drivers of biodiversity decline. The ecological knock-on effects in Swiss lakes will play out in the coming years.‘Going back is a fairytale’Each mussel can filter up totwo litres of watera day, feeding primarily on phytoplankton, which forms the basis of the lake food chain. Tiny creatures such as water flea feed on phytoplankton, and then fish feed on the water flea. When the base of the chain disappears, it has cascading impacts on the entire food web, and potentially severe impacts on the livelihood of the 120 professional fishers working on Lake Geneva.View image in fullscreenData is gathered from a floating research laboratory on Lake GenevaView image in fullscreenScientists are working to track changes in the lake and model ecological processes. Photographs: Jordi Ruiz Cirera/the GuardianThe filtering activity of quaggas also results in the water being clearer, which means light penetrates deeper. Like climate breakdown, this can lead to warmer water reaching deeper, with knock-on effects including an increase in toxic blue-green algal blooms. Previously, cold air from the atmosphere created lake currents, resulting in the mixing of water, but this hasn’t happened since 2012.Once quagga mussels are in a lake there is nothing you can do, other than stop them colonising other lakes by cleaning boats and fishing equipment.After thousands of years of stability, Lake Geneva is undergoing a period of huge and irreversible change in the space of just a decade. In the American and Canadian lakes, there are no signs of quagga populations falling after 30 years of colonisation.Ibelings says: “Going back is a fairytale, because of quagga mussels and climate change. We cannot control either, and I don’t think they will go away. We need to understand what they are doing to the lake.”In the future it is possible that nature will evolve, and some fish may adapt to eat quagga mussels, but ecologists say Lake Geneva will never be the same. “We need to accept at some point, whatever is there – this is a different lake, now,” says Ibelings.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageThe subheading and text of this article were amended on 18 December 2025.

As a result, experts are urging people to wash their hands regularly, make sure indoor spaces are well ventilated, get a free vaccination if eligible, and stay home where possible if symptoms develop.An average of 3,140 people were in hospital with flu each day by the end of last week, an increase of 18% compared with the previous week. At the same time last year, an average of 2,629 patients were in hospital, while in 2023 the number was 648.However, flu cases have begun to slow in some parts of the country, although theNHShas emphasised that the service is “not out of the woods”.In the north-west ofEngland, hospital cases of flu fell by 4% over the past week. But flu cases continued to rise in other parts of England, with patients in hospital up 39% in the east of England and 40% in the south-west.The figures come as resident doctors in England begin the second of five days of strikes over a pay dispute.Graph of flu patients in EnglandProf Meghana Pandit, the NHS England national medical director, said although flu cases were not rising as quickly as feared across some parts of the country, the NHS was “nowhere near out of the woods yet”.“Combined with the impact of strikes, a stream of winter viruses means many hospitals will be on high alert in the days ahead,” Pandit said. “But it remains vital that people continue to come forward for NHS care as normal.”Critical care beds were occupied by 128 flu patients across England last week, up from 106 the week before.An average of 427 hospital beds were also filled each day last week by patients with diarrhoea, vomiting or norovirus-like symptoms, an increase of more than a fifth (21%) compared with last week.Just under a third (28%) of patients arriving by ambulance at hospitals in England last week waited at least 30 minutes before entering A&E, down from 32% the previous week.Separate figures published by the UKHSA show that hospital admission rates for flu in England have plateaued, at 10.3 admissions per 100,000 last week, compared with 10.2 the previous week.People over 85 had the highest admission rate at 64.6 per 100,000 last week, up from 58.1 the previous week, while the rate for 75 to 84-year-olds was 31.4, broadly unchanged from 31.6.For children under five, the rate was 27.3 per 100,000, up from 20.3.Dr Alex Allen, a consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said: “With Christmas just around the corner, it’s reassuring to see that flu levels are now starting to stabilise, but flu is notoriously unpredictable and can bounce back and peak a second time in the new year, and so we’re urging people to continue taking sensible steps over the festive period to help stop the spread.”The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “Flu continues to put significant strain on the NHS, with record numbers of patients in hospital, and frontline services remaining under enormous pressure. I’m appealing to the public to protect yourself and your loved ones by getting your flu jab.“The British Medical Association’s regrettable decision to pursue strike action at this critical moment is piling on the pressure, but the NHS team has responded brilliantly to keep the show on the road. Our entire focus is on keeping patients safe through the strikes and this peak period for the NHS.”Explore more on these topicsFluHospitalsEnglandHealthNHSIndustrial actionDoctorsnewsShareReuse this content"

The report led to suggestions that the governmentmight consider new lawsto correct the power imbalance in franchise agreements.A group of 62 former Vodafone franchisees broughta high court claimin 2024, alleging the company “unjustly enriched” itself in 2020 by slashing sales commissions.The court papers alleged that Vodafone acted in “bad faith” by unilaterally cutting fees to its franchisees; imposed fines of thousands of pounds for seemingly minor administrative errors; and then cajoled them into taking out loans and government grants to keep their businesses afloat. The claimants said they were left with massive personal debts.MPs representing constituents in the case – including former Conservative minister Sir John Hayes, Labour’s Luke Akehurst and Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice – have been pressing the company to visit Westminster for months.The parliamentarians are scheduled to discuss the escalating row with Vodafone on 21 January, in a meeting first reported by Sky News.Vodafone said: “We have tried on multiple occasions to resolve this complex commercial dispute.“We offered to make a significant payment which we believed would ensure no claimants had debts associated with their franchise. We remain open to further talks and are sorry if any franchisee had difficulty in operating their business.”In September, Vodafone startedoffering financial settlementsto a selection of former franchisees who are outside the group of legal claimants as it launched its fourth investigation into its franchising division.The company has apologised to claimants who blamedpressure from the telecoms groupfor triggering suicidal thoughts. A survey of franchisees in September 2020 resulted in 78 out of 119 leavingoverwhelmingly critical commentsabout the effects Vodafone’s actions had had on their mental health.In response to the Guardian’s investigation, a Vodafone UK spokesperson said: “While we are sorry if any partners have had a difficult experience, we reject any suggestion that our franchisees were put under undue pressure.“We continue to run a successful franchise operation, and many of our existing franchisees have expanded their business with us by taking on additional stores.“We encourage everyone to raise issues, and we will always seek to resolve them, and we remain open to further discussions with claimants to resolve the commercial dispute.”The company said it “wholly rejected” any suggestion that it “knowingly or recklessly or negligently” put anybody involved with its franchise stores under unreasonable pressure.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Mone was appointed to theHouse of Lordsas a Conservative peer by David Cameron in 2015.In October,the DHSC won a high court judgmentthat the 25m gowns PPE Medpro supplied under the second contract, for which it was paid £122m, were not certified to be sterile, as required.On 30 September, the day before the judgment was made public, the company was placed into administration by a private trust company registered in the Isle of Man linked to Barrowman.The DHSC has said that, including interest and costs, it is now owed £148m. HMRC hassubmitted a claim of £39mfor unpaid tax, of which £31m is corporation tax, according to documents filed with the high court.The DHSC opposed proposals set out by the administrators last month for managing the company and seeking to recover money, and instead applied for PPE Medpro to be wound up.In its proposals, the administrators did not detail where PPE Medpro’s money from the government contracts had gone, but said: “A review of the company’s bank statements reflects a small number of entities that have received the vast majority of funds from the company’s bank accounts.”At Thursday’s hearing in the insolvency and companies court, Simon Passfield KC, for the administrators, said there were “potential” legal claims that could be brought on behalf of the company against unnamed “third parties”, which “could result in substantial recoveries” of money, but provided no further details.David Mohyuddin KC, for the DHSC, said in a written submission that PPE Medpro should be wound up, saying the company was “obviously and very significantly insolvent”.Mone and Barrowmandenied for years, through their lawyers, that they were involved in PPE Medpro, despite questions from the Guardian and reporting to the contrary.In November 2022, the Guardian revealed that Barrowman had beenpaid at least £65mfrom PPE Medpro’s profits and had then transferred £29m to an offshore trust set up to benefit Mone and her three adult children.After a political outcry, Mone took a leave of absence from the Lords. Following criticism from the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, after October’s court ruling, Mone said she hadno wish to return to the Lordsas a Conservative peer.In December 2023,Mone admitted in a BBC interview that the couple had liedto the media, and they confirmed their involvement in the company. Barrowman acknowledged he had been paid approximately £60m and transferred money into the trust; the couple said his children were also beneficiaries.After the companymissed a 15 October deadlineto repay the money owed due to the high court judgment, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “We will pursue PPE Medpro with everything we’ve got to get these funds back where they belong – in our NHS.”With the company now in liquidation, the government still faces significant legal obstaclesin recovering the money.Streeting said: “We said that we will not rest until we’ve got back hard-earned taxpayer money paid to rogue operators like PPE Medpro, and today we’ve taken further action to do just that.“During the pandemic, when the whole country was making huge sacrifices, separated from family and loved ones, PPE Medpro supplied defective PPE and unfairly profited.“We will keep going after PPE Medpro with everything we’ve got to get these funds back where they belong – in our NHS.”Explore more on these topicsMichelle MoneCoronavirusHouse of LordsWes StreetingHealth policyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

TheElectoral Commission, which had been asked to open a separate inquiry into other elements, said it had not identified any undeclared spending that should have been reported.“We have assessed a report relating to an allegation around misreported expenditure by a political candidate in connection with the general election in July 2024,” Essex police said.It said the report had been made on 5 December. “Having regard to the Representation of the People Act 1983, which states any prosecution for such an offence must commence within one year, it has been concluded that this report falls outside of the stated statutory time limit, and no investigation can take place.”The Electoral Commission said: “We have responded to Anna Turley MP’s correspondence, which raised questions about Reform UK’s spending at the 2024 general election. After carefully considering the information presented in the letter, we did not identify any expenditure relating to Mr Farage’s election campaign in Clacton that should have been declared in Reform UK’s national expenditure.”On Wednesday, Turley, the Labour party chair, had called on Farage to “urgently come out of hiding” and explain whether his party had spent more than the £20,660 limit for campaigning, in a letter to the Electoral Commission.“If expenditure that ought to have been declared in Mr Farage’s return in Clacton has been included in Reform’s national spending return, or elements of national party expenditure have not been declared at all, there is a real risk that Reform’s party spending return is inaccurate or incomplete, which is a matter for the Electoral Commission,” Turley wrote.That followed the news that a whistleblower had told the Daily Telegraph Reform had failed to declare spending on leaflets, banners, utility bills and refurbishment of a bar in its Clacton campaign office.Sam Power, an academic at the University of Bristol and an expert in political financing, said the police, not the Electoral Commission, had the power to investigate the main allegation against Farage.“The commission have purview over party spending, not campaign spending. So they would have to be misreporting in these returns. Turley asked them to look at whether party spending had not been declared, and [whether] Clacton spending had been reported as national spending. Given that the main allegations related to potential campaign overspend – a matter for the police – [Turley’s request] was a bit of a square peg in a round hole.”A Reform spokesperson previously denied the allegations, saying: “The party denies breaking electoral law. We look forward to clearing our name.”Farage has been facing multiple troubles – chief among themallegations of overt racism during his schooldays, as well as by party colleagues more recently.On Wednesday,26 of his peers at Dulwich collegecondemned him for what they described as his refusal to acknowledge his behaviour at Dulwich college and criticised him for saying their allegations about his past behaviour were politically motivated.Reform described the allegations as a “witch-hunt” and “an attempt to discredit Reform and Nigel Farage”. “Instead of debating Reform on the substance of our ideas and policies, the leftwing media and deeply unpopular Labour party are now using 50-year-old smears in a last act of desperation. The British public see right through it,” a spokesperson said.Farage has also been urged to sack one of his party’s mayoral candidates after it emerged he said the deputy prime minister, David Lammy, should “go home” to the Caribbean. Lammy is British.Reform UK has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKElectoral CommissionGeneral election 2024RacenewsShareReuse this content"

Russia’s cyber operations form part of a broader influence campaign intended to undermine western support for Ukraine.”It added: “The DDIS assesses that the Danish elections were used as a platform to attract public attention – a pattern that has been observed in several other European elections.”The director of the DDIS, Thomas Ahrenkiel, said they were “very certain that these are pro-Russian groups that have connections to the Russian state”.Denmark’s defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said the attacks were “completely unacceptable” and he was taking the incidents “very seriously”. In an attack on a water utility in Køge in December 2024, a hacker took control of a waterworks and changed the pressure in the pumps, resulting in three burst pipes.“This is very clear evidence that we are now where the hybrid war we have been talking about is unfortunately taking place. It once again puts the spotlight on the situation we find ourselves in in Europe,” Lund Poulsen said.The Danish foreign office would summon the Russian ambassador for a meeting, he said. “It is completely unacceptable that hybrid attacks are carried out in Denmark by the Russian side,.”Britain caught in ‘space between peace and war’, says new head of MI6Read moreAlthough the attacks caused limited damage, the minister for resilience and preparedness, Torsten Schack Pedersen, said they showed that “there are forces capable of closing down important parts of our society”.Denmark, he added, was not sufficiently equipped to withstand such attacks from Russia. “I think you have to be incredibly naive if you think we are at the top of cybersecurity.”Copenhagen described a series of drone incursions on Danish airports and areas of military significance in September as a “hybrid attack”. The incidents, which exposed gaps in its defence capabilities, contributed to plans to establish a European“drone wall”.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkRussiaEuropeCyberwarCybercrimeHackingInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

No, I don’t think he will run for a third term,” Dershowitz added.However, Dershowitz’s book lays out potential scenarios in which another Trump term could become a possibility – including having the electors in the electoral college abstaining from casting their votes and instead having the House of Representatives select the president.The possibility of Trump seeking a third term has been a recurring theme since he returned to the White House for a second time last January.Trump himself has sent out mixed signals. In October, he told journalists that the constitution was “pretty clear” that he is “not allowed to run”, although he has repeatedly said he would “love” to do so.Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House of Representatives and one of his key allies on Capitol Hill, has said he “doesn’t see a path” for Trump to run again.Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, dismissed the prospect of a third Trump term in aninterview with Vanity Fairpublished this week. She told the magazine that Trump “knows he can’t run again” but is “having fun” with the idea because he knows it is “driving people crazy”.At the same time, however, the Trump store has begun selling “Trump 2028” hats to his supporters.Dershowitz told the Journal that, after meeting Trump, he showed a draft copy of his book to Miriam Adelson, the billionaire businesswoman who gave more than $100m to Trump-supporting political action committees during the 2024 presidential race, and who was visiting the White House for a Hanukah party.According to him, she responded: “Is this real? Oh, my God, I hope this can happen.”Later, when Trump brought Adelson on stage during the party, she confirmed she had spoken with Dershowitz. “I said, ‘Alan, I agree with you. So we can do it.’” Her comments were met by chants of “four more years” from the assembled crowd, at which point Adelson told Trump: “Think about it.”Trump responded by telling the crowd: “She said, ‘think about it and I’ll give you another $250m.’”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the move could hit newsrooms and other media publishers as it may stop their users from sharing their content.Publishers already saw a huge fall in online traffic after a Meta decision in 2023 to de-prioritise news content and switch to featuring more videos and viral, short-form content. Facebook traffic to news sites had been recovering this year, but was down 50% in a year in 2024, according to some measures.The latest trial is part of a campaign to find ways of encouraging Facebook users to sign up to Meta Verified, which costs from £9.99 up to almost £400 per month per profile depending on the tier. It offers extra account features and security.In screenshots shared by users, Facebook warns: “Starting 16 December, certain Facebook profiles without Meta Verified will be limited to sharing two organic [ie free] posts per month. Subscribe to Meta Verified to share more links on Facebook, plus get a verified badge and additional benefits.”David Buttle, the founder of media consultancy DJB Strategies, said Meta had been “in a deliberate retreat from news for several years”.“After withdrawing from publisher payments, and blocking news links entirely in Canada in response to regulation, it has made clear that news is no longer strategic,” he said.“This latest experiment – which for now excludes publishers – reinforces a shift away from free distribution and towards monetising reach, as Meta looks to squeeze more value from legacy platforms.“This may be linked to its costly andwidely acknowledged misstep in the metaverse, while now doubling down on AI.”A Meta spokesperson said: “This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers.”In January,Meta said it would “take a more personalised approach to political content, so that people who want to see more of it in their feeds can”. That move appears to have led to more news content appearing once again, according to analysis by Press Gazette and Similarweb.It found that one of the biggest winners wasthe Express, owned by Reach. Facebook grew as a source of its social traffic by 26% in a year. The site made up 75% of all social traffic to the Express in March.Explore more on these topicsMetaFacebookSocial networkingSocial mediaNewspapersDigital mediaNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

A study has found that swearing can enhance physical performance by lowering inhibitions and pushing the brain into a “flow state”.“In many situations, people hold themselves back – consciously or unconsciously – from using their full strength,” said Dr Richard Stephens, a psychologist at Keele University who led the research. “Swearing is an easily available way to help yourself feel focused, confident and less distracted, and go for it a little more.”Previous research found that swearing could increase strength and pain tolerance in tests where participants repeated swearwords while pushing themselves to the limit, such as cycling at maximum effort or holding a hand in icy water. Researchers initially hypothesised that swearing triggered a “fight or flight” response but found no supporting evidence, such as an increased heart rate.Instead, the latest research suggests swearing triggers a state of disinhibition. “By swearing, we throw off social constraint and allow ourselves to push harder,” said Stephens.To test this, the researchers ran two experiments involving 192 people. In each, participants were asked to repeat either an expletive of their choice or a neutral word every two seconds while performing chair pushups. After completing the exercise, they answered questions about their mental state during the task.Their answers suggested that swearing boosted self-confidence, improved psychological “flow” and distracted them from the task – important aspects of disinhibition. Confirming earlier findings, the researchers found that swearing increased the length of time people could maintain a chair pushup by 11%.“These findings help explain why swearing is so commonplace,” said Stephens. “Swearing is literally a calorie-neutral, drug-free, low-cost, readily available tool at our disposal for when we need a boost in performance.”Stephens said the power of swearwords was likely to lie in their taboo nature. His team is investigating whether more offensive language produces greater physical gains, in a “dose-response” trial that will test how long participants can tolerate holding their hand in icy water while repeating either mild or strong swearwords.The team is also exploring whether the confidence boost associated with swearing could help in other contexts, such as public speaking or making a romantic approach.“There are lots of situations where hesitancy might be to our detriment,” said Stephens. “You could go into a quiet room, go for it swearing for a minute and then go out and give your talk. I bet people do it already.”However, he cautioned that swearing was not an entirely risk-free strategy. “You’re never quite sure when you use a swearword how it’s going to land,” he said. “You have to know your audience and who is around. You could land yourself in hot water if you swear inappropriately.”The findings are published in the journalAmerican Psychologist.Explore more on these topicsPsychologyResearchHigher educationnewsShareReuse this content"

The prosecutors alleged the refinancing caused the collapse of the bank.Greensill Bank was founded by LexGreensill, an Australian financier who rose to prominence by providing supply chain finance, in which companies receive advances on invoices in exchange for a fee.The company rapidly rose to prominence, andhired the former UK prime minister David Cameronas a paid adviser. However, it collapsed in 2021 amid concerns over risky loans to GFG companies.Two of the people charged were formerly members of the bank’s management board, and another was a member of its supervisory board, the prosecutor’s office said in astatementon Wednesday.The prosecutors said there was a “suspicion the accused deliberately misrepresented the loan business in the 2019 accounting records and financial statements as a low-risk and regulatory-compliant receivables purchase programme”.It is understood that Lex Greensill is not one of the people charged by the Bremen authorities. Greensill Bank was based in the northern German city.The case adds to the lengthy legal fallout from the Greensill collapse. Since 2021, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office has been investigating suspected fraud and money laundering in relation to GFG companies and their financing arrangements with Greensill Capital UK, another part of Lex Greensill’s empire.It is understood that GFG companies have not been involved in the German prosecutor’s investigation or in any of the proceedings inGermany.The Greensill collapse caused turmoil in Gupta’s companies, as they sought to find different lenders. Gupta has since lost control of several metals businesses around the world, including inFrance,Australia, and the UK. The UK high courtplaced Speciality Steel UK into administration in August, prompting the government to step in to run several steelworks in south Yorkshire.A spokesperson for GFG declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsBankingGreensillGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The FTSE 100 company is expected to come under further pressure as changes to the way business rates are calculated come into effect next year.Corvex argued that Whitbread’s share price undervalued some of its assets, including its UK portfolio of leasehold properties, its German hotels, and properties that are under construction.Corvex also called on Whitbread, which has more than 800 Premier Inn hotels in the UK, to review its current five-year capital plan, which involves about £3.5bn of investment.The hedge fund now owns a 6.05% stake in Whitbread, making it theFTSE100 company’s second biggest single shareholder, behind the US asset manager BlackRock. Corvex added it would seek a seat on Whitbread’s board.A spokesperson for Whitbread said: “Whitbread has a clear strategy and business model, and our five-year plan is designed to deliver strong returns for shareholders through growth in both the UK and Germany.“We run our business for the long-term but remain flexible, and as stated in our announcement on 28 November, we are exploring various options to further drive profits, margins and returns in light of the impact of measures in the UK budget.”Last month, the company said changes in the autumn budget would cost it £40m- £50m in its next financial year.Multiple analysts downgraded their view on the stock in the days after the budget, with the broker Bernstein arguing the impact ofbusiness rate changes would be a “hammer blow” to the company.Bernstein examined a sample of 67 Premier Inn hotels and found the median increase in the rateable value of its properties to be about 174%, with most of its estate above the £500,000 level, meaning no relief. Bernstein cited the Manchester Piccadilly Premier Inn as an example, where it calculated there would be a 385% increase in its rateable value.The broker estimated the overall impact on Whitbread’s pre-tax profits would be up to £30m in the first year, £90m in the second year and £140m in the third. Shares in Whitbread rose by as much as 6% in early trading on Thursday, but are still down by more than 10% over the year to date.Explore more on these topicsWhitbreadFood & drink industryFTSEBudget 2025BudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

Carol Howle, BP’s head of trading, will run the firm until O’Neill takes up the top job in April.Woodside boss says young people ‘ideological’ on fossil fuels while ‘happily ordering from Temu’Read moreThe incoming oil boss will be BP’s first female chief executive in its 116-year history, and the first woman to head any of the world’s top five oil companies. Her appointment also marks the first time BP has hired an outsider for the top job.The surprise appointment of BP’s third chief executive in five years emerged just weeks afterBP appointed Albert Manifold to chair the board. Manifold replaced Helge Lund who presided over the oil company’s failed attempt to adopt a green energy agenda.The shake-up will be taken as a sign that the British oil firm is seeking a renewed push to improve its business, with itsshares and earnings lagging behind competitorssuch as ExxonMobil and Shell for years as it pursued green energy projects at the expense of growing its oil and gas production.BP’s green strategy was set by its previous boss, Bernard Looney, who was appointed by Lund in 2020 to transform the business into an integrated energy company. However, the transition was undermined by a rise in global oil and gas prices, as well as theshock departure of Looney in 2023.Looney was dismissed anddenied more than £32min pay and share awards after admitting he had failed to fully disclose to the board a series of personal relationships with his colleagues.Auchincloss blamed the company’s “misplaced” optimism over the speed of the energy transition earlier this year and promised shareholders he would “fundamentally reset” BP by slashing billions in planned renewable energy initiatives and shifting its focus back to traditional oil and gas.He had been under pressure since the feared New York hedge fund Elliott Investment Management took a stake in the company earlier this year. Elliott was pleased with O’Neill’s appointment, according to a source familiar with its thinking cited by the Financial Times.Auchincloss will leave the company on Thursday. BP had not publicly announced a search process for his successor before it announced his departure late on Wednesday evening.Manifold said: “Progress has been made in recent years, but increased rigour and diligence are required to make the necessary transformative changes to maximise value for our shareholders.”O’Neill, who has headed Woodside since 2021, previously spent 23 years at ExxonMobil. Under the American’s leadership, Woodside merged with BHP Group’s petroleum arm to create a top 10 global independent oil and gas producer valued at $40bn (£30bn) and doubled Woodside’s oil and gas production.“With an extraordinary portfolio of assets, BP has significant potential to re-establish market leadership and grow shareholder value,” said O’Neill.“This is clearly a high-profile hire, and probably some of the change that BP shareholders have been looking for,” said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners.Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC, said: “It is a little surprising to see the chairman willing to make a major change in such a short period of time, given he has little direct oil and gas experience. That said, with the activist in the shares, it felt like this move was more of a ‘when, not if’.”Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “With the sector facing pressure, consolidation is the talk of the town, but BP is most frequently seen as prey rather than the hunter.“Rival Shell hasdistanced itself from takeover speculation, but there are other potential suitors. O’Neill may have a fight on her hands to ensure BP’s not sold for a song, and to keep a seat at the table if it were to join forces with a competitor.”Earlier this year, O’Neillsuggested at a gas industry conferencethat young people who take an ideological stand against fossil fuels are hypocrites for ordering cheap online consumer goods “without any sort of recognition of the energy and carbon impact of their actions”.Liz Westcott, who leads Woodside’s Australian operations, has taken over as its acting chief executive.BP shares rose 1% in early trading on Thursday morning.Explore more on these topicsBPOilCommoditiesEnergy industryOil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

However, it is believed that Elliott could appoint investment bankers early next year.Elliott declined to comment. Barnes & Noble and Waterstones were approached for comment.Barnes & Noble and Waterstones are the two biggest booksellers in the US and the UK, respectively. Together they have more than 600 shops in the US, and more than 300 in the UK.Much of the success has been driven by James Daunt, the chief executive of the two booksellers and the owner of his eponymous independent book chain in the UK. He has led Waterstones since 2011, during which time the company has stood its ground against Amazon and snapped up rivals such as Foyles and Blackwells.Daunt told the BBC this month that an IPO in either New York or London felt like an “inevitability”, as private owners typically aim to sell businesses on.He said: “It feels like an inevitability and probably better than being flipped to the next private equity person.”Elliottacquired Waterstones in 2018 for an undisclosed sum from its previous owner, the Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut.The fund then bought Barnes & Noble in 2019 for $683m (£510m).‘Suddenly, it was everywhere’: why some books become blockbusters overnightRead moreElliott, which is based in New York, has a reputation for its aggressive shareholder activism, going into battle against some of the world’s biggest businesses. It has built up its presence on the UK high street, including through its stake in the food chain Wasabi.Last year,it made a bid to buy the electronics retailer Currys, although it ultimately failed. It has also exerted pressure on the board of BP, which on Wednesday nightousted its chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, less than two years into his role.An IPO would be welcome news for the UK stock market, which has struggled to attract big new companies in recent years and has seen a number of businesses move their listings to New York or return to private ownership.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryIPOsWaterstonesBarnes & NobleBooksellersLondon Stock ExchangeLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Let me count the ways. Or at least allow me to gaze, rapt, from behind an ornamental palm tree as your vintage convertible hurtles towards yet another catastrophic Hollywood assignation.The Emmy-winning creation of Seth Rogen and long-term writing partner Evan Goldberg, The Studio follows Matt Remick, an idealistic film executive who finds himself unexpectedly promoted to head of Continental Studios. “This could be my time!” he gasps, cock-a-hoop to find himself in charge of the company to which he has devoted the last 22 years of his life. He is, unfortunately, correct. “Film is my life,” he splutters during his tearfully grateful acceptance speech to CEO Griffin Mill (Bryan Cranston). Mill – an oleaginous sod with a spray tan the colour of a 70s ski lodge – smiles thinly. “At Continental, we don’t make films. We make movies. MOOOOVIEEEEES that people wanna PAY to see,” he explains, tightly, and Matt’s face proceeds to sink like a souffle. And it continues to sink over 10 exquisitely excruciating episodes, as his hopes for a new era of intelligent, auteur-helmed blockbusters are repeatedly marmalised by a system both frightened and angered by anything that can’t be deposited in a Swiss bank account.View image in fullscreenSeth Rogan’s Matt Remick makes Martin Scorsese cry in The Studio.Photograph: APMatt is played, perfectly, by Rogen, whose resemblance to a depressed Fozzie Bear is entering its imperial phase (I can’t be the only one who spent the series half-expecting Rogen to turn to camera after his latest clanger and say “wocka wocka,” sadly, in a neckerchief).Matt is a well-meaning coward whose best intentions are fatally stymied by his need to be liked by celebrities. He is also only too aware that he is clinging to his new job by his fingertips; a schlubbily bearded echo of the scene in 1923’s Safety Last! in which Harold Lloyd dangles desperately from a clockface. (A reference that cinephile Matt would doubtless enthuse over, even if the ensuing pitying looks from his colleagues would only remind him, once again, that he is very much in The Wrong Job).Matt struggles to spin his many idiot plates, whether while attempting to cobble together a movie cast that won’t offend anyone or pretending to Ron Howard that he likes his new three-hour film (“Why do you keep lying?” “I don’t know!”).Highlights? Matt, having accidentally destroyed Sarah Polley’s new movie, being chased off set by an incensed crew while shouting, “I’m trying to support women!” Cranston’s deliciously seedy throwback Mill and Kathryn Hahn as perpetually furious marketing maven Maya Mason. Antonio Sanchez’s breathless, clanking, jazz-elbowed panic attack of a score.“But it’s not scathing enough!” bleat the naysayers, miffed at the prospect of another episode in which Matt falls over an expensive prop, or makes Martin Scorsese cry, or shouts at his own penis because it’s not weeing fast enough to allow him to return to a film set in time to inadvertently ruin yet another scene. Where are the razorblades, the grumblers ask; where is the satirical deathblow that will reduce Hollywood to a smoking ruin? To which The Studio says: phooey. It isn’t that kind of comedy. It knows Hollywood is circling the drain, but it still wants it to succeed; its deep and unironic affection for cinema ensuring that even when it’s pointing out the industry’s infinite hypocrisies, it still has enough warmth to power one of Continental Studio’s gamechanging blockbusters (eg Duhpocalypse: a satire about zombies with diarrhoea).For all its fancy trimmings and celebrity cameos (Zac Efron! Charlize Theron!), The Studio isn’t doing anything new. Not really. But what it does do – beautifully calibrated farce; unapologetically niche in-jokes; men in tan leisure-suits shouting “I seem to be panicking all the time, man!” while Martin Scorsese sobs in the background – is more fun than almost anything else around.Long may it panic, man.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radio2025 in TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What brought you back to the frontlines?Mstyslav Chernov: What brought me back was not speaking to the audiences, even, but just coming out of Mariupol, we were so devastated and so scarred by what happened. And then we went off toBucha, where we sawmore war crimes. And then I went to Kharkiv, my home town, which was bombed every day, just as Mariupol was. So even when we were starting to edit 20 Days in Mariupol, I was already looking for a story that would be, in a way, a response to that feeling I had, of devastation and helplessness. I kept seeing Ukraine as a victim of this brutal invasion, and I wanted to tell another story which would have an opposite direction – to show some sort of agency, some sort of strength and response to that violence, when Ukrainians push back.AH: And that was when Mariupol was already out? What was that dissonance like for you – being on the Oscar circuit, then filming on the frontlines?MC: That was when the theatrical release started in July. It was the same time as Barbie and Oppenheimer, and it was the same time when we had dozens and dozens of Q&As for the wider public. It was when the first receptions and red carpets started. But of course, at the same time, the frontline was on fire.Ukrainewas fighting this counteroffensive. And I would go from those places in the United States, in the UK, in Europe, these beautiful, peaceful cities, back to Ukraine – fly to the border, get a car, get a train, get another car, get in a trench. And in that trench, I would see a world that was so different. It would be like another planet, or 100 years backward in time. That collision of two worlds – I just tried to express it. I tried to comprehend it, how we live in a world where both war and peace and humanity and violence exist. And so 2000 Meters to Andriivka naturally became a film about distances, not just about the reality of war, not just about the humanity of people who are pinned down in those foxholes. But also about the distance between Europe and Ukraine, between Ukrainian society and people in the trenches. Hopefully that comes through.AH: How does that distance feel in the aftermath of this movie, particularly between Ukrainian society and the frontlines. Have you seen it widen? Narrow?MC: I have to say, since the beginning of 2025, a lot of people in Ukraine, especially those on the frontline, but also Ukrainian civilians who were increasingly bombed by the missiles and drones, have a feeling of abandonment by the international society. That brought a lot of people together. That’s what I find amazing about Ukrainians, but it’s amazing about humans in general. When we feel distressed, when we feel abandoned, we unite. And then we give each other strength through that. The harder things become, the closer people feel. I think it’s a huge mistake, thatRussiathinks that bombing Ukrainian cities with ballistic missiles is going to help them negotiate the deal that they want, on the terms they want, and that the Ukrainian public will just distance themselves from soldiers or distance themselves from the government. That’s not going to be the case.View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian servicemen fires towards Russian positions in 2000 Meters to Andriivka.Photograph: AP PhotoAH: Makes sense.MC: I also think that the Ukrainians – I mean, I’ve seen more than 70,000 people come to cinemas to see 2000 Meters to Andriivka, which is extraordinary during a wartime. I’ve seen how they appreciate the realism and truth of the film, the acknowledgment of sacrifice and pain that Ukrainian soldiers, civilians, everyone is giving to this war – especially at a time when there’s a large consensus around the world, even with Ukrainian allies, that Ukrainians should just give away this land. Andriivka would also be gone. So just the knowledge of how important that place is, and what it was worth to liberate it, is crucial.AH: I attended theSundancepremiere in January, and I remember yousaid thenthat you don’t want to be prescriptive. You’re more interested in questions, and that this film is first and foremost a memorial document. But I’m wondering, in showing this film to audiences around the world, do you find yourself wanting to impart a certain message?MC: My main message is to make sure the film is interpreted in the right way. Again, because this film is not a simple film, it’s not a propaganda film. It’s a film that is about more — it’s about Ukraine, it’s about the war itself, it’s about us in this moment in history, where we’re on the verge of a war. And how do we survive that moment in our history? I want the audience to see how futile and terrible this entire concept of war is, and how we, as humans, shouldn’t do it to ourselves. But at the same time, that the self-defence of Ukrainians isn’t futile.AH: That seems like a crucial distinction.MC: When I speak to Ukrainian audiences [about the film], it’s about memory – remembering those men and their sacrifice. But the international conversation is that too many people, too many politicians around the world, are saying that this war is futile. I couldn’t agree more, but the self-defence isn’t.AH: It’s tough, with something like this, to talk about hope. Things can’t be wrapped up neatly. But where do you find hope right now for 2026?MC: What I learned through the making of this film, and one of the reasons why I embarked on it, is to find hope myself, to understand that even in the moments when it feels dark everywhere, there is light in people who we are standing with, together. Each one of the men we meet throughout the film brought me that hope. I went into that forest where this entire film takes place with a sense of hopelessness. And I found my hope. I found trees that have been destroyed by artillery already growing back. I’ve seen people who, despite knowing that they might lose their friends, lose their life, that they might set the flag and it still might fall, are still doing it. They’re still defending their families. That gives me hope that Ukraine, however hard it will be, will remain.Explore more on these topicsFilm2025 in cultureUkraineEuropeRussiainterviewsShareReuse this content"

It culminated in 3,547 complaints being submitted about the 24 July edition of the show. More than 2,000 complaints were received on each of the two previous days.The vast majority of complaints were made in relation to claims of alleged bullying against Khan, who broke down in tears on several occasions. It came after the emergence of apparent cliques in the Love Island villa.Some viewers believed Khan was being subjected to negativity from the other women in the show, as she was often shown alone and subjected to jibes and eye rolls. Tensions reached a peak when she ended a relationship with one islander, Conor, to pursue another, Harry.Producers also raised the tension by showing Khan and another contestant criticising two other women. Concerns for her mental health were also raised as she was repeatedly shown crying.Despite the thousands of complaints, Ofcom ultimately decided not to investigate the show. It said the negativity towards Khan was not celebrated and that viewers of the show – and reality shows generally – had come to expect the kinds of scenes that were the subject of complaints.Other protests were from viewers complaining that one contestant who had left the villa was later allowed back in. However, ITV makes clear that producers can “reintroduce an islander seen in earlier stages of the competition who was previously evicted”.The broadcaster has also said participants are given training in advance of arriving in the villa, which involves the need to avoid “behaviour patterns associated with controlling and coercive behaviour”.In fourth place in the complaints charts was an episode of Vanessa Feltz’s Channel 5 show, in which the fashion designer Karen Millen described mothers who breastfed their children beyond six months as “selfish”.Viewers complained the item was misleading. Ofcom concluded the comments “did not raise issues under our rules” and medical guidance had been provided to viewers at the start of the section.Rounding up the top five was a GB News item from January, in which the presenter Josh Howie made a comment linking the LGBTQ+ community to paedophiles. He later said his was a comedy show and his comment was intended as a “joke about paedophilia in the church”.Ofcom’s subsequent investigation found the programme had broken broadcasting rules by including a “highly offensive remark which was not justified by the context, falling short of generally accepted standards”.GB News also apologised this week after a guest wrongly stated that the Duchess of Sussex’s mother, Doria Ragland, had spent time in prison.Explore more on these topicsLove IslandITV plcOfcomTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Less remembered today is a darkly brilliant European film about a stage actor in Nazi Germany that went home from the ceremony with the best international feature prize. Mephisto, directed by István Szabó, was the first ever Hungarian film to do so.“The moment took me by surprise,” remembers Szabó, 87, four decades later. “I didn’t expect it.” Visibly elated on the live broadcast as he took to the stage, Szabó today says that he “knew this award wasn’t just mine, but also Brandauer’s”, meaning the film’s electrifying lead actor, and the largely Hungarian crew “who contributed with their talent to the making of the film”.Though 1981’s Mephisto was a landmark film in Hungarian cinema, it has largely disappeared. A DVD run in the early 2000s fell out of print, and the film has generally been overlooked by the major streaming platforms. This December, Second Run – in collaboration with the National Film InstituteHungary– have restored and rereleased Szabó’s masterpiece, along with its follow-ups Colonel Redl, an epic about a gay officer in the Austro-Hungarian empire, and Hanussen, a Nazi-era occult drama also featuring Klaus Maria Brandauer.View image in fullscreen‘An actor wants to assert his talent at all costs’ … Klaus Maria Brandauer as Hendrik Höfgen in Mephisto, 1981.Photograph: Analysis/AllstarMephisto tells the story of Hendrik Höfgen. An ambitious stage actor as the Nazis come to power in Germany, Höfgen cuts himself off from his roots in the leftist theatre scene to ingratiate himself with the fascist regime. “Höfgen is a very talented actor who wants to assert his talent at all costs,” says Szabó. “To stand in the middle of the stage, in the spotlight.” Friends and colleagues are arrested, killed, exiled. But Höfgen only digs in deeper with the Nazis, who make him head of the Berlin state theatre.All of this is told through the extraordinary central performance of Brandauer, the Austrian actor (later director) depicting all of Höfgen’s frustrated ambition, wilful ignorance and fatal capacity for seduction in a performance as vivid and shocking as any in cinema history. Today, Szabó pays tribute to the “particularly talented actor” with whom he collaborated most recently in 2020’s Final Report. “It was crucial for me, for us, to decide what to show in close up from Brandauer’s secrets. What he reveals and what he conceals.”Mephisto is based on the real life story of Gustaf Gründgens, whose career soared when the Nazis ploughed subsidies into the stage to shape it in their own image. In 1936, Gründgens’ former lover Klaus Mann wrote a scathing, thinly veiled novel about the actor, later subject to a landmark 1960s libel case that resulted in the book being banned (on paper, the ban still applies today, though the book is widely published). Gründgens died in 1963 having never publicly expressed remorse for his Nazi affiliations. But in Szabó’s hands, Mephistobecomes a universal work of art: specific and cliche-free about the politics of 1930s Germany, but also a wider Faustian fable about man’s opportunistic complicity with evil.With authoritarianism on the rise across the globe, does Mephisto hold lessons for the 21st century? “The desire for self-assertion is a human trait that can create many positive values,” says the director. “The problem arises when it is used for the sake of a wrong ideology or policy, and a talented person allows themselves to be exploited, or even fights in support of those in power. This still exists in the 21st century, and it does not necessarily require a dictatorship. The power of business is enough. Or some other motive.” Szabó rebuffs a question about 2026’s Hungarian parliamentary elections, thought to be the tightest for Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party in his 15 year tenure (“of course I’m interested, like everybody else”).View image in fullscreen‘History marches relentlessly through central Europe’ … István Szabó.Photograph: Reynaud Julien/APS-Medias/ABACA/ShutterstockThis year has seen an increased focus on Hungarian art, with László Krasznahorkai being awarded this year’s Nobel prize in Literature anda Booker win for Hungarian-British novelist David Szalay. Szabó says that he considers himself a Hungarian director, “but it is important to emphasise central European existence in this context. History marches relentlessly through central Europe.” In Szabó’s work, this has meant depicting the close of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the Holocaust (Szabó has explored his wartime Jewish upbringing in Budapest in films such as Sunshine and early work Father) and Hungary’s communist dictatorship (in 2006,he admitted having informed to the secret police, which he said was part of an effort to save the life of a classmate).Szabó is as pessimistic about cinema as directors in their 80s tend to be, but praises Barnabás Tóth’s 2019 film Those Who Remained, a lyrical film about life after the Holocaust, and Bálint Szimler’s controversial Fekete Pont (Lesson Learned), a broadside against Hungary’s state education system. So far, the only other Hungarian film to match Mephisto’s Oscar winning achievement is 2015’s Son of Saul.Is Szabó’s own future in cinema any more certain? “I can’t say whether I’ll have a chance to make another film,” says the director, who cites the “quite serious physical work” of directing as his main obstacle. “You have to go up to a lot of people to talk to them, because you can’t shout over other people’s heads.”Mephisto, Colonel Redl and Hanussenare released as a Blu-ray limited edition box setExplore more on these topicsFilmHungaryEuropeNazisminterviewsShareReuse this content"

Prepare to gorge yourself silly on it over the holidays along with the mince pies. You know you want to …Hannah J DaviesThu 18 Dec 2025 03.01 ESTShare‘Turn off your brain and jump!” So says London geezer Alfie (Lucien Laviscount) to ex-girlfriend Emily’s best pal Mindy (Ashley Park), as they flirt their way through a racy dance scene. It could, of course, be an instruction to viewers of season five ofEmily in Paris, too. Once pilloried for its Anglophile tendencies and surface-level commitment tola culture française, the fluffy dramedy about an American in Paris helmed by Lily Collins has – over the past five years – become one of TV’s greatest guilty pleasures: a fancy fever dream of great clothes, strapping love interests and a constant karaoke soundtrack courtesy of Park, a Broadway star whose contract clearly dictates that she sing at least five times per episode. The clothes are less outlandish this time around, but still aspirational – lending the show a strand of Sex and the City DNA (they also share a creator, Darren Star).But, unlike SATC – whose spinoff And Just Like That devolved into a mindless mess – Emily in Paris is free of any baggage, and at liberty to be as silly as it fancies. Much of season five doesn’t even take place in Paris, as our leading lady continues to mix business and pleasure in Rome with cashmere heir Marcello (Eugenio Franceschini). “Ciaoandni hao!” says Mindy, who has rejected a job as a judge on Chinese Popstar (“I’d rather be judging people in real life than on TV”) and is now headed to Italy, just in time to help Emily and her crack marketing team with some #sponsoredcontent (read: singing inside a giant martini glass). Also in town is Alfie: cue an inadvisable fling between the two that instantly breaks all the rules of girl code.Michelin-starred chef Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) is back, too, and you won’t need much French to understand his instant regret in following Emily to Rome:“Je pense que c’était une très, très mauvaise idée.”Not that she even knows that he’s there: she’s too busy truffle-hunting in deeply impractical heels, while Marcello’s sisters make snide remarks about her in Italian. At least Emily’s still a force to be reckoned with in the marketing world. At one point, she has the incredible idea of rubbing hamburger meat all over her hands to attract the attention of a dog, whose owner, in turn, is a high-powered fashion designer.Brava!View image in fullscreenSpacey socialite … Minnie Driver as Princess Jane in Emily in Paris.Photograph: Giulia Parmigiani/Netflix © 2025There are many, many new faces, the best among them being Minnie Driver as a spacey socialite, Princess Jane, who knows everybody “from Fiat to Fendi”. She is sure she can bag Agence Grateau’s Rome office some high-profile clients (for a fee). Driver laps up the campiness of the whole thing, savouring lines like, “You picked the right city for an affair … have fun on Saturday night, confess Sunday!” Her character also serves an important purpose in Emily’s fourth-wall-shattering world: as we learn of her financial woes, she becomes the conduit for a plethora of product placement, including – but not limited to – delivering a Peroni commercial at a party.There is also – perhaps surprisingly – more emotional heft to this series than previous outings, and the sense that Emily and friends are growing up. Collins became a mother in real life earlier this year, and while Emily isn’t thinking about children, there’s definitely more maturity to the character, who looks back wistfully on her early days in Paris (her“belle époque”, she says); takes offence at a work pitch poking fun at her many exes; and wonders what the future holds for her medium-distance relationship. There’s also a (slightly strained) extended metaphor about a fake handbag, and how real things with Marcello truly are. Emily’s boss and nouvelle vague-ish heroine Sylvie (the ever-excellent Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu) reconnects with some new men and with an old friend, while Emily considers – perhaps for the first time – that she and Mindy might not be BFFs any more.View image in fullscreenUh-oh, trouble ahead … Emily and Mindy (Ashley Park) in Emily in Paris.Photograph: Giulia Parmigiani/NetflixBefore things can get too heavy, though, the series steers us back towards the absurd and the outrageous, including a twist with Sylvie’s new love interest which – predictable as it is – is very fun. Bruno Gouery gets loads of brilliant, waggish lines, too, as Emily’s colleague Luc. I only hoped we’d see more of fellow Agence GrateauconfrèreJulien (Samuel Arnold), as he masterminds a campaign to rebrand a homophobic water brand.Still, Emily in Paris (and Rome) remains a total hoot, and the sort of thing you’ll surely want to gorge on over the holidays alongside the mince pies.

Now, after decades working as a lawyer, she is taking the name – though, contentiously, not the rest of the band – back on the road. ‘I haven’t given the best of me yet’, she saysThu 18 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTShareAt the height of her music career in the early 1980s, Lesley Woods got accustomed to dealing with irate men. As the singer and guitarist of Au Pairs, the Birmingham post-punk four-piece, she recalls “guys being aggressive purely because you were a woman on stage”. At one show, the band were on the bill with UB40 and the Angelic Upstarts, only the latter didn’t turn up. “So the audience, who were 95% skinheads, were gobbing at us and throwing anything they could get their hands on – which included a bin.” Was she scared? “No, I was bolshie back then. I just went to the front of the stage and said: ‘You missed.’”After the band split in 1983, Woods hoped her days of dealing with overt misogyny were behind her. But then she retrained and became a lawyer. “When I came to the bar [in the 1990s], women couldn’t even wear trousers. I used to get men saying: ‘What colour knickers are you wearing today, Lesley?’ It’s better now, but back then law was way worse than music in how it treated women.”Woods – who is now 67 – still works as a barrister, specialising in immigration law, though in the last 15 years she has dipped her toes back into music, performing occasional solo gigs and self-releasing an EP, In the Fade, in early 2025. Next month, she returns to the stage for a UK tour as Au Pairs. Led by Woods, the band now has new members: Estella Adeyeri of the Black feminist punk band Big Joanie, and the Thurston Moore Group’s Jem Doulton and Alex Ward. “They are all a lot younger than me, but then most people are,” she says with a dry laugh.I meet Woods over tea and biscuits at her home in east London where she lives with her small dog, Dusky. Woods is hilariously unfiltered: pithy pronouncements about former associates, both in law and the music industry, are invariably followed by a more cautious, “You should probably leave that out, or I’ll get into trouble.” Woods is currently deep into Au Pairs rehearsals and loving every minute of it. “The band know the old songs but we’re working on new stuff, too. I’m hoping we can make an album.” But not everyone is so thrilled with the Au Pairs reboot. When they split, the band – who, alongside Woods, comprised bassist Jane Munro, guitarist Paul Foad and drummer Pete Hammond – were not on good terms. Though there has been sporadic email contact, Woods says they haven’t been in the same room for more than 40 years.It was a promoter who originally approached Woods about a tour. He hoped the original band might reunite but when Woods demurred, saying the others wouldn’t be keen, he suggested hiring new musicians. Woods says she contacted the ex-members out of courtesy. “I said to them: ‘I am reforming Au Pairs. Are you interested?’ They responded as I imagined and said no.” Woods didn’t tell them a tour was on the table, as she wanted to “sound them out first. It’s no good going on a tour if you can’t get on.”It’s upsetting that something that started off with such great ideals and in a happy state of mind has disintegrated to this pointAfter they declined to be involved, Woods trademarked the band name and set about finding new musicians. When the tour was announced, the ex-members sent out a press release making clear their displeasure. In a joint statement to the Guardian, Munro, Foad and Hammond say that Woods had asked them if they were interested in reforming, “but it didn’t feel like a genuine or friendly offer and we responded individually, declining for different reasons. Days later we discovered she’d trademarked the band name behind our backs.We asked her to make clear this was her project and distinct from the Au Pairs – unfortunately the tour was advertised with the cover of our first album, which misled people into thinking it was the original lineup … The tour should not be going out under the Au Pairs name with only one original member involved.” They challenged any suggestion that Woods was the driving force. “We were ALL the driving force and have fought to keep the band’s music in the public domain.”Woods acknowledges the tour was initially advertised on a third-party website using a picture of the original lineup, but says that she requested the picture be taken down.She says that, for the ex-members, it’s a case of “we don’t want to do it, but we don’t want you to do it”. She adds that it’s “extremely upsetting that something that started off with such great ideals and in a happy state of mind has disintegrated to this point”.View image in fullscreenCome again … Woods (second right) and her new-look Au Pairs.Photograph: Polly HancockThe Au Pairs formed in 1978 after a chance meeting between Woods and Foad at a bus stop in Birmingham; the pair began dating and set about assembling a band, though the relationship ended before the first Au Pairs album came out. Woods was studying philosophy and French at Birmingham University at the time but dropped out and transferred to Keele in Staffordshire which “was a hotbed of leftwing politics and feminism”. Woods funnelled what she was learning about gender politics into songs that were furious, funny and defiantly explicit.Au Pairs’ debut LP, 1981’s Playing With a Different Sex, proved a thrilling showcase for their jagged guitar-based rock and declamatory songwriting. Tracks included We’re So Cool, which examined open relationships – “I don’t mind if you want to bring somebody home” – and Come Again, which depicted a woman providing tongue-in-cheek commentary as a man tries to bring her to orgasm: “Is your finger aching? I can feel you hesitating.”For Woods, the lyrics were “the antithesis to the boy-meets-girl, drippy falling-in-love stuff”. Was she worried how people would react? “Not at all. Though I do remember Paul’s mum saying: ‘You shouldn’t sing about that, that’s private.’ But I guess you’re brave when you’re young.” Elsewhere, the song It’s Obvious fantasised about a time when gender roles ceased to matter, while Headache for Michelle, about being too strung out on drugs to protest society’s ills, was inspired by Woods’ first girlfriend who “was a bit of a drug fiend”. Woods says her own drug of choice was speed, “partly because I had a terrible complex about being fat and the one thing speed did was stop me eating”.When you’re starting out, it’s wonderful, like being at the start of a passionate affair. Unfortunately it doesn’t always lastKathleen Hanna has cited Au Pairs as an influence on her band Bikini Kill and the wider riot grrrl movement, and Kurt Cobain was said to have been a fan. Critics were also full of praise. Hailing them alongside the Raincoats and the Slits, Lester Bangs wrote that “the absolute best rock’n’roll anywhere today is being played by women: last night I saw God in the form of the Au Pairs” while the venerable Greil Marcus wrote a paean to them in his book In the Fascist Bathroom. Along with the provocative lyrical content, Woods’ sexuality became a talking point in interviews. Though she identifies as bisexual, back then it was easier to tell journalists that she was a lesbian, despite knowing it could harm her career. “Any number of male artists were in the closet back then, for good reason. But I guess being in a band, and being around people who are endorsing you, your values and politics, puts you in a kind of bubble.”Despite the current fractious relations between Woods and her ex-bandmates, the singer still looks back with pride and affection at the early days, when they were a gang of friends touring the country and having a blast. “If you look at the early photos, we all look very happy. When you’re starting out, it’s wonderful. It’s like being at the start of a passionate affair. You’re so happy and you’re in love with each other and everyone else. Your passion for the music and the chemistry, it’s all there. But unfortunately it doesn’t always last.”Supporting the Jam, sausages with the Bay City Rollers and defying skinheads: post-punk girl group Dolly Mixture look backRead moreThings began to sour with their second album, 1982’s Sense and Sensuality, which saw Au Pairs embracing a more eclectic and rhythmic sound. Woods says the band “lost our sense of musical direction and the new material wasn’t worked through enough. But we were up against it financially, and we had to get in the studio.” At the same time, she was losing her voice as she had been “slaughtering it” during live shows trying to make herself heard over shonky PA systems. Woods was also in a volatile relationship, the details of which she’d rather not get into, but which was “very traumatising. I don’t think I’d been open with anyone about that because I’d probably felt ashamed or embarrassed.”After playing more than 200 shows in the space of a year, Au Pairs were exhausted and stopped communicating with one another. Then their record label went bankrupt. Munro was the first to leave the band. Woods says that Au Pairs were subsequently offered a new contract with another label and a chance to record with the producer Steve Lillywhite, but she met with Foad and Hammond to discuss it and they said they’d had enough. “So that was it. That was the end.”With the band over, Woods left Birmingham and moved back in with her parents in Stevenage. A desire for a fresh start led to her enrolling to do a law degree. “I thought: ‘What can I do that’s really difficult that will help me get my head together?’” The training lasted five years. “I never thought I’d pass the exams. When I got the results, I’d gone to Paris and my mum phoned and said, ‘You’ve passed’. I was, like: ‘Oh no. I’ll have to carry on now.”Woods has now worked as a lawyer for 35 years. In that time, she has always intended to return to making and performing music. Now feels like the right time to restart Au Pairs, she says. “At my age, it’s not like the future is stretched out in front of you. Time isn’t on my side, and I think I can make a good album. I wouldn’t want to leave this world without having tried. I don’t think I’ve given the best of me yet.”Au Pairs tour from January, first with the Skids and later with Gina Birchandthe Unreasonables.Explore more on these topicsPunkPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Burke was a toddler when her mother died from stomach cancer, meaning she has no memory of her. In the Islington council flat where she grew up, she shared a bedroom with her alcoholic dad who would give up booze only to fall off the wagon and, at his worst, became violent. When a stranger on the estate called her ugly in front of her friends, she cannily deflected the insult with laughter. “I’m the best dancer at the ugly bug ball though,” she hooted, and did a little dance.Burke would find her tribe on London’s punk scene and, in her teens, got the acting bug and a place at London’s Anna Scher Theatre school. This put her on the path to a brilliant and varied acting and writing career that saw her appearing in comedy sketches withHarry Enfieldand French and Saunders, being called a genius by Peter Cook and taken by Luc Besson’s private jet to collect the prize for best actress at Cannes film festival for Gary Oldman’s 1997 film Nil By Mouth. There, much to her chagrin, she found herself “accepting a bellini cocktail from Harvey fuckface Weinstein”.Such gobby one-liners are to be expected from a no-nonsense comic actor who finds fame “embarrassing”, but they are extra delicious when delivered by Burke herself.

Invited for dinner at the home of one of them, Bruno finds himself seated next to a woman named Jenny, a struggling ballet dancer with a gloomy aspect and no sense of humour. Bruno is drawn to her nonetheless, and finds himself inventing stories about her. The following day, he is admitted to hospital to undergo tests: a small lump on the side of his neck has raised some concerns. Bruno cannot help feeling the two events are somehow connected.It comes as little surprise to Bruno when he learns he has cancer. The doctor in charge of his case, Josef Ackerman, offers a choice: he can either undergo the gruelling and fallible radiotherapy currently prescribed for his disease, or he can become a pioneer in a new, radically experimental treatment programme in which patients are “frozen down”, remaining in a state of suspended animation until such time as medical science has advanced sufficiently to offer a cure.We know already that Bruno will opt for the latter – there would be no story if he did not. And when he is awoken 22 years later in 1995, we are unsurprised to discover that the future in which he finds himself is no paradise. True, Bruno’s cancer has been cured, and if he is chronologically speaking a middle-aged man, in biological terms he remains a sprightly 33. Indeed, while Bruno has been “down”, the idea that someone might have two ages has become relatively commonplace. But so has a system in which the near-immortality achieved through “all-life” – now the world’s most pressing social and political flashpoint – must be worked and paid for, while those who opt for “now-life” and the natural death that comes with it are forced to mortgage their vital organs to maintain the affluent lifestyles offered as a reward for not taking the treatment. This brave new society is beginning to disintegrate under the pressure of supply and demand.Most poignant of all is the fact that this novel – like Bruno – has itself been resurrected decades into its own futureAt first glance, such dystopian trappings might seem overfamiliar. Like Orwell’s Winston Smith, Bruno is both a prisoner of the nightmare and its idealistic proving ground; Ackerman is likewise doomed to become a victim of the system he helped to create in which doctors, together with the tech corporations that employ them, wield the most power. Mass surveillance is universal, and as the new regime becomes increasingly repressive, so previous modes of being are rendered literally unthinkable through the outlawing of the language that might be used to express them. “The old language gradually became full of meaningless words,” Ackerman explains to Bruno in what would seem to be a direct reference to Orwell’s Newspeak. “Boring words, which just upset people.” Yet this caustic and surprisingly tender novel is considerably more than yet another whimsical variant on Nineteen Eighty‑Four.Anders Bodelsen, who was part of the Danish new wave, uses the armature of science fiction to frame urgent questions about the present: the invasive nature of capitalism, our attitude to ageing and above all the difference between “life” and “eternity”. There is a strain of dark humour running through the novel that makes it enjoyably entertaining in spite of the grim reality being portrayed, while Bruno’s reflections on the losses suffered through the pursuit of an impossible goal embody genuine pathos.“A man who is going to die is given two alternatives: that he should live for a while and write his story; or die, wake up again, and hope there would be even better stories to be told.” Freezing Point maintains a running meta-commentary from Bruno on the art of fiction, and this subtly experimental novel, in which an apparently simple language advances complex conceits, has more than a flavour of Kafka about it. Powerfully recurring symbols – skating on thin ice, Jenny’s affinity with the mechanical doll in the ballet Coppélia, the lyrics of the Beatles song Hey Jude – add to the dreamlike atmosphere and sense of deja vu.Most poignant of all is the fact that this novel – like Bruno – has itself been resurrected decades into its own future. Some references are jarring, even problematic; the realm of its present seems to us now like an alien, analogue, depleted world. It is also a simpler one, more refreshingly tactile and – in spite of its cold war anxieties – less threatening. The pressurised, claustrophobic reality Bruno wakes up to feels uncannily like our own. Freezing Point is a surprising and original novel of ideas: thought-provoking, inventive, even frightening. It is also a sustained and beautiful piece of imaginative writing, thoroughly deserving of its second chance at life.Freezing Point by Anders Bodelsen, translated by Joan Tate, is published by Faber (£9.99).

He should be mopping it.”In a Truth Social post hyping up the address – subject unknown – Trump promised: “It has been a great year for our country, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!”Stephen Colbert on Susie Wiles’s candid interviews: ‘She dished, bish’Read more“I agree – theEpstein files are due on Friday,” Kimmel quipped. “Basically, the speech tonight was taking the stand in his own defense. It was opening statements.“It really is amazing that this fool is president.”In other Trump news, the president recently unveiled a new “presidential hall of fame” in the White House, featuring highly politicized plaques offering a Maga interpretation of history: that Barack Obama passed the “‘Unaffordable’ Care Act” and was “one of the most divisive political figures in American history”; that Joe Biden, representedonly by an autopen, was “dominated by his Radical Left handlers”; and that Ronald Reagan was “a fan of President Donald J Trump long before President Trump’s Historic run for the White House”.Reagan, as Kimmel reminded, died in 2004 and was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease a decade before that. “What was he a fan of, exactly? Trump’s Pizza Hut commercials?” Kimmel wondered. “What a sad individual this is. He knows, deep down, deep down in the pit where his soul should be, in that pot where all the undigested chicken and off-brand Sudafed piles up, he knows that no one respects him. He knows they all just want something from him. And he knows the world is laughing at him, and that his brain and face are like a Creamsicle melting on the sidewalk.“It takes a special kind of lunatic to get his insults cast in bronze,” he concluded. “Can we please put this man in a home before he completely destroys the one he’s in now?”Stephen ColbertOn the Late Show,Stephen Colberttried his best to avoid talking about the 9pm “old grandpa ramble-pants sundown jamboree”.Jimmy Kimmel on Trump’s Rob Reiner comments: ‘So hateful and vile’Read more“We talked about doing the show live tonight to cover the speech,” he told his studio audience, but decided not to “because – and just to give you a little peek behind the showbiz curtain – we would have to have watched it. And I don’t want to do that no more.”Colbert took issue with Trump announcing the speech “out of nowhere” with the promise that “the best is yet to come!”“OK … kind of a mixed signal to announce an emergency national address because everything’s going great,” Colbert said. “It’s like your mom calling and saying: ‘Hey honey, I know you’ve got work, but is there any way you could fly down here tomorrow? Because your dad … is doing great!’“It’s a really big deal for networks to just hand over their primetime slots on such short notice,” he added, “especially because here, at CBS, his 9pm speech cuts right into the middle of the three-hour Survivor season finale. Unless that’s the final challenge – ‘Survivors, you’ve endured starvation, extreme heat and poisonous snakes. But for your final challenge, you must listen to a bitter old man talk about aballroom.’”Seth MeyersAnd on Late Night,Seth Meyerschecked in on a White House in “damage control” mode after the chief of staff, Susie Wiles, gave a series ofhighly candidinterviews toVanity Fair.Among other things, Wiles said Trump had an “alcoholic’s personality”, referred to JD Vance as a “conspiracy theorist for a decade” and called Elon Musk an “avowedketamine user”.Meyers claimed it was “weird” and “in many ways, it’s not surprising” that Wiles said such things, other than the fact that she remains working at the White House. “She said the president she currently works for behaves like an alcoholic, the vice-president is a conspiracy theorist and the most likely explanation for the ramblings of the richest man on Earth is that he’s on drugs,” Meyers laughed.Stephen Colbert on Trump’s ‘gold card’: ‘Pay-to-play program for rich foreigners’Read moreWiles also defended Trump’sfriendshipwith the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, because they were “young, you know, sort of young, single, whatever – I know it’s a passé word but sort of young, single playboys together”.“I didn’t think it was possible to make Trump’s relationship with Epstein sound any worse, but Susie Wiles did it,” said Meyers. “You’re not helping Trump’s case by saying he and Epstein were playboys together. That’s like saying, ‘Oh yeah, I was friends with Hannibal Lecter, but only because we’re both foodies!’”Meyers also mocked the article’s accompanying photoshoot, which featured high-ranking cabinet members, including Vance, along with Wiles in the West Wing.“They all thought they were going to look so cool, and while they were posing for these glossy photos, their colleague was bad-mouthing them,” Meyers laughed. “This is like if you pose for a high-school yearbook photo thinking you’ve been voted ‘most likely to succeed’, and then when it came out, your superlative said ‘most likely to shit his pants at lunch’.”Explore more on these topicsLate-night TV roundupJimmy KimmelStephen ColbertSeth MeyersTV comedyComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So with panto season once again in full swing, we speak to seasoned professionals about the exhausting, error-laden, explosive truth behind the most “magical” season of the year.Adam Buksh playedThe Genie in Aladdin at Howden Park Centre, Livingston, West Lothian, in 2013It was halfway through the show when Aladdin got trapped in the cave. Our version was based on the original story, One Thousand and One Nights (not Disney’s), in which Aladdin possesses two magical entities: a powerful Genie of the Lamp (me) and Scheherazade, Genie of the Ring. I was on stage with Aladdin and Scheherazade, using my magic to smash the ring and break the evil sorcerer’s curse. For dramatic purposes, we used a handheld pyrotechnic which was similar to a little lighter with a wheel flint, but made of metal. I would use it to break the ring and free Aladdin from the cave.I couldn’t see what the cast did when it exploded, but I’m certain we all jumped with frightUnfortunately the pyro was packed a little too full. As I flicked the wheel mechanism, the top shot off into the audience, narrowly missing them (I have no idea where it went, but no one was harmed). The bottom, a red-hot metal casing, blew out and stuck to my skin. The pyro had exploded in my hand!I couldn’t see for about 10 seconds and couldn’t hear for another 30 – all in front of 300 audience members. I couldn’t see what the cast did when it exploded, but I’m certain we all jumped with fright – I sure did. When my sight returned, I had to lip read to know when I had to say my line. I remember I said, “Woo! That was a bit unexpected, eh?” And we just carried on as if that was supposed to happen. I didn’t need medical attention, and after the show, the person who had packed the pyro apologised profusely and hugged me. I replied in a whisper: “I can’t hear a word you’re saying.”It could have been worse.During a previous panto run of Jack and the Beanstalk in Arbroath, we had an “egg gag”, as part of a baking competition skit. I would pop a rubber egg in my mouth, and the dame a real one, the gag beingthat the dame deliberately breaks the egg in their mouth, the audience hears the crack, then yolk drips out of the dame’s mouth and hilarity ensues. During one performance, we looked down, and the real egg had the biggest streak of bird shit we’d ever seen. The dame bit the bullet (well, egg in this case) and popped it in her mouth regardless. That’s dedication to panto if ever I saw it. I’m inA Christmas Carol in Glasgowthis year and thankfully there are no pyrotechnics nor egg eating.View image in fullscreenAnna Soden as Dave the Cow at York Theatre Royal, 2023.Photograph: Sam TaylorAnna Sodenplayed Dave the Cow in Jack and the Beanstalk at York Theatre Royal, York, in 2023I was playing opposite my childhood hero,James MacKenzie. He played Raven in CBBC’s Raven, the 00s children’s adventure game show. I was a huge fan. I remember thinking, if you could show me, as a child, that my job is acting next to Raven, with me dressed as a cow, I’d have thought I was in Hollywood! However, before a two-show day, I scalded my hand. I did it on the hot tap while I was trying to steam my voice, essential to survive panto season – pouring a bowl full of boiling water and breathing in the steam to hydrate your vocal cords and maintain your voice. Previously, I had become mildly addicted to throat lozenges. Turns out if you have too many, they can have a laxative effect (I found that out the hard way).Between my scenes, I was lying on the floor of the dressing room, half-naked human, half cow, having a complete breakdownAnyway, I didn’t think the burn on my hand was that bad, but as the show went on, it became excruciating, and I had a panic attack on stage dressed as a cow. Between my scenes, I was lying on the floor of the dressing room in my pants, half-naked human, half cow, having a complete breakdown. I was hysterically crying on the floor, my body didn’t know what to do. The director of the show came in and said, “Do you need the next show off?” I should have said yes, but it’s panto. Adrenaline kicked in, and I got back on stage for the finale to play the trumpet with Raven; the audience had no idea that minutes earlier I had been having a total meltdown.It turned out the burn wasn’t that bad, and I got nominated for an award by the UK Pantomine Association for playing Dave the Cow in 2024, but I lost out to a nonspeaking goose. You couldn’t make it up.View image in fullscreen‘Unlike any other show, in panto, you make these lovely friendships’ … Ewan Goddard as Peter Pan.Photograph: Courtesy of Jordan ProductionsEwan Goddard played Peter in Peter Pan at Gordon Craigtheatre, Stevenage, in 2016It was a real marathon, 96 shows in total. A typical Saturday consisted of three shows, with barely 20 minutes between each. At the end of the first show, I would peel off my elaborate green and silver finale costume right down to a sad beige dance belt. I shivered while eating a tuna sandwich, but I could never eat very much, because, as Peter, I flew. In the space of 20 minutes, I had to get back into the complete green Peter costume: first the green tights, then the harness, then I’d make sure I was all “packed in”, then the shorts (which had holes for the harnesses), then the top, cuffs and hat (which I had to pin to my head because of the flying).Miraculously, I got through without injury, except for the worst chafing of my life from the harness. Not only was it like a corset around my waist, which I had to stay in all day, but to make Peter fly, I had two crew members who controlled the rope. One pulled a rope to make me go up and down, while the other guy goes side to side. As if that wasn’t enough, I performed two sword fights, a spinning pirouette, and sang Defying Gravity in mid-air with only Wendy for company. All while wearing a chafing harness. There was no getting away from it. My skin was so red, it felt like it was on fire!It was around show 87 that I was close to a complete existential meltdown. I remember dangling in the rafters and being so jealous of the actors who got to sit and walk. Except for Tinkerbell, she was on roller skates. I thought:“I don’t know if I can keep going. ​​Where will I find the physical strength to keep going?” I didn’t have to look far. Tinkerbell, Wendy and the Mermaid saved me. Unlike any other show, in panto, you make these lovely friendships. We banded together and propped each other up to make sure we got through it. The director helped by regularly reminding us that Tinkerbell, Wendy and the Mermaid have the magic of panto. That was a lovely responsibility to have, and it made the chafing, spinning, and exhaustion worth it.Sadly, the encouragement from my cast members and director did little to alleviate the chafing and redness caused by the harness. I treated that with baths, manymanybaths! An absolute necessity for post-harness recuperation, with muscle soak bubble bath. The audience never knew just how close to exhaustion and a permanent skin condition I was, and I took great pride in that. I’m excited to play a wicked stepsister this year inCinderella in Southend, where I can walk and sit comfortably … I hope.View image in fullscreenNatalie Law as Princess Amelia.Photograph: Robin SavageNatalie Lawplayed Princess Amelia in Jack and the Beanstalkat Broxbourne CivicHall, Hertfordshire, in 2014Looking back, I don’t know how I survived it. After a punishing five-week, three-show-a-day run, we were close to the end, I knew I had a water infection. At 1am, I got so ill that Charlie Dimmock, who was playing the organic fairy godmother, had to drive me to an out-of-hours clinic for me to get medicated. I managed to get through to the last show, but the antibiotics had not worked. I knew this because I was in agony and, in between scenes, was going off stage to vomit, then returning to the stage to perform dance numbers, sing solos, and, of course, get locked in a cage by the angry giant. After the final show, I went with my boyfriend, not Charlie Dimmock this time sadly, straight to A&E because it had turned out to be a full-blown kidney infection. The audience was none the wiser. I chose to keep going because I love show business so much ... apparently!View image in fullscreenLuke Adamson in Jack and the Beanstalk at Hartlepool town hall in 2022.Photograph: Aimee TurnbullLuke Adamsonplayed Chester the Jester in Sleeping Beauty at HoxtonHall, London, in 2021I have received many injuries in the line of duty as a panto actor. Hoxton Hall is a lovely venue, but because it’s old the door frames are pretty low. The exit from the stage was down a steep, curving staircase and through one of these doors. I was charging off to do my quick change into the costume for the walk down (when actors return to the stage for their bow and applause), and the top of my head collided, quite forcefully, with the top of the door frame. I was able to complete the change and get back on for the walk down,but then I suddenly saw seven different audiences. After the show, I collapsed in a chair in the dressing room, and by that evening, I was in the hospital with a concussion. With a few changes to my track, I still made it on the following day.I ended up in the middle of the cake tiers, covered in creamThen, during Jack and the Beanstalk at Hartlepool town hall in 2022, I broke my rib by falling on to myelbow during a slosh scene, which is an extended comedy-slapstick scene, featuring soap, water, slime, or foam, and lots of mess. In our show, we used “cream” for our slosh scene because we were baking a big cake for the giant and putting the cream on the sponge. The joke was that I ended up in the middle of the cake tiers, covered in cream. I was supposed to fall on to the sponge and then have a load of cream poured on to me, followed by the second sponge. One performance I didn’t quite land right, and I ended up with my arm tucked into my body, my whole weight coming down on it. Followed by alotof cream!This year, I’m Beryl, the ugly sister inCinderella at Loughborough Town Hall Theatre. Luckily, I’m injury-free so far ...Charlie Barnes,stagedoor supervisoron Cinderella at The OrchardTheatre, Dartford, 2017It’s not just the actors who suffer during panto season. At the end of Act One, Cinderella is transformed before attending the ball. The pumpkin was changed into a carriage, and the mice turned into shetland ponies. Actual real-life shetland ponies! They were brought in from a horse box outside in the dock, through the stage door and on to the stage for five minutes. The audience went mad for them. However, as cute as the miniature ponies were, I sadly had to clean their poop off the stairs twice a day for a month before everyone stampeded through it at the interval. And you would presume that miniature ponies would do miniature poops. Nope! They were still regular-sized horse poops. Strangely, never once did they poop on stage; they always waited for me backstage, ready with the shovel. Not the most glamorous of jobs but it was definitely worth it for the kids’ reactions. MerryChristmas, one and all!Stewart McCheyne, played Peter Pan in Peter Pan at Motherwell Civic Centre, Motherwell, 2016This year I’m Mervin the Magician in Sleeping Beauty at the Assembly Hall theatre in Tunbridge Wells. But years ago I was playing Peter Pan and had lots of flying to do. Which of course comes with potential problems: getting caught on lighting rigging, parts of the set etc. One day, after defeating Captain Hook, I sung my celebration song, then me and the lost boys (six small children) had to run through the left aisle of the audience giving people high fives. I was then to exit the theatre, walk through the foyer and come back down the right aisle.Now, at the back of the theatre was a set of double doors and then a stairwell. I opened the doors, lost my footing and fell down the stairs. I had my lost boys behind me asking if I was OK. I sort of just smiled and said I was. I pulled myself up the stairs but realised I couldn’t put much weight on my ankle. I then hobbled back through the audience singing When I Grow Up from Matilda. I finally got on stage and was attached to the flying rig again. I was hoisted up in the air ready to say goodbye to Wendy and the gang. I remember the look on Wendy’s face. She had her back to the audience and was looking up at me as she mouthed “your knee”. That’s when I noticed all the blood running down my leg: I was just dangling up in the air dripping like a big floating teabag!The nurses in the hospital were all very excited to see me – most of them had been to see the panto the previous week on a work night out.Explore more on these topicsTheatreChristmasActingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With comic elements thrown in, he is usually out of his depth in money-making antics that backfire, often commissioned by Charlie Endell, an underworld villain and strip club owner (played by Iain Cuthbertson). The opening credits depicted him grabbing at banknotes blowing in the wind.The first episode ended with Budgie, just released from jail and estranged from his wife (Georgina Hale), bringing back to Hazel’s flat a fruit machine stolen from a cricket club. By the start of the second series, when he is again emerging from a spell in prison, he and Hazel – who is pregnant with their second child – are no longer together, although she soon takes him back.Dalby said she empathised with her put-upon character. “I think she just wants security and stays with Budgie because he’s all she has,” she explained. “I can imagine doing the same thing in her position.”In 1972 Dalby switched to a role in the newly launched ITV soap operaEmmerdaleFarm (later retitled Emmerdale), centred on the farming Sugden family in a small Yorkshire Dales community. Her character, Ruth Merrick, first seen in episode seven, harboured a secret – her son, Jackie, whom her husband Tom believed to be his, was fathered by her ex-lover Jack Sugden.During two stints, in 1972 and 1974, there was no rekindling of the flames and Ruth attempted suicide before settling down in Leeds with Tom (although the character was brought back in 1980, going by her first name of Pat instead of her middle name, and with a different actor, Helen Weir, taking over the role).View image in fullscreenLynn Dalby in 1997. She moved to Australia in the 1980s and appeared in TV shows including Sons and Daughters.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyIn 1977 Dalby married the actor Ray Lonnen, but they divorced in 1983 and a year later Dalby emigrated to Sydney, Australia. She continued her career on screen and stage there before returning to Britain in 2019.She was born in Harrogate, North Yorkshire (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire), to Veronica (nee Lawson) and David Dalby. As a sergeant in the British army’s Medical Corps, he moved the family around to Cyprus and West Germany before returning to Harrogate and working as a jeweller’s dispatch manager.From the age of 12, Lynn trained at the Corona Academy in London, at the same time appearing in uncredited roles as schoolgirls in the films The Pure Hell of St Trinian’s (1960) and Spare the Rod (1961). “I was one of those freckle-faced precocious children,” she recalled later, when she complained that her height (5ft 2in) and fresh-faced look for a long time meant she was always cast as “the dizzy secretary or the daughter who falls in love with the head boy”.Dalby’s early career in touring companies and repertory theatre included a stint in her home town before she performed in a string of West End musicals. She played the milkman Tevye’s bookish daughter Chava in Fiddler on the Roof (Her Majesty’s theatre, 1970-71), but was unfortunate to appear in two short-lived flops, Lie Down I Think I Love You (Strand theatre, 1970) and Romance! (Duke of York’s, 1971), before Budgie came along.By then, she had already reached a wide television audience as Rita, one of the two female gnomes in the writerJimmy Perry’s BBC sitcom The Gnomes of Dulwich (1969), alongside Terry Scott andHugh Lloyd.She later played a French diplomat’s daughter coerced into helping drug smugglers in Return of the Saint (in 1979) and appeared in the BBC’s Francis Durbridge thriller serial Breakaway (1980) before joining Crossroads. As Rita Hughes (1980-81) in the ITV soap, she was a secretary who became another notch on the bedpost of Adam Chance (Tony Adams), an accountant on his path up the motel management ladder.Repeated television screenings of the 1975 horror film Legend of the Werewolf, starring Peter Cushing andRon Moody, kept her face in front of audiences, playing an orphaned sex worker who falls for a “wolfman” played by David Rintoul.On moving to Australia, Dalby was on television in the mini-series Tusitala (1986) as the wife of Robert Louis Stevenson’s vicar friend there during the novelist’s final years, the soap opera Sons and Daughters as Joyce Carter (in 1987) and popular series such as Water Rats (in 1996) and All Saints (in 2001).She is survived by Amy, her daughter with Lonnen, and her two sisters, Lesley and Gillian.Lynn Margaret Dalby, actor, born 17 February 1947; died 22 October 2025Explore more on these topicsSoap operaTelevisionEmmerdaleobituariesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Flowers are such an easy win for the gift-giver, too. There’s a plethora of online flower delivery services with a range of offerings. Some provide next-day delivery; some will deliver flowers monthly via subscription; some will even slip in a box of chocolates, a bottle of fizz or a candle in the delivery.But which flower delivery services are best? I’m here to answer that for you. I’ve tested dozens of bouquets and done a deep dive into flower freshness and the services’ sustainability, trying my best to find ones that offer British-grown flowers.Remember: if your recipient has pets, check whether the flowers are toxic before sending them (read more about which aretoxic for catsanddogs).At a glanceBest flower delivery overall:Marks & SpencerFrom £25 at M&SBest budget flower delivery:Scilly FlowersFrom £16.50 at Scilly FlowersBest flower subscription service:Freddie’s FlowersFrom £28 a box at Freddie’s FlowersBest same-day flowers:InterfloraFrom £32.50 at InterfloraBest letterbox flowers:Bloom & WildFrom £19 at Bloom & WildWhy you should trust meI’ve been in the product-testing game for four years now, and have reviewed more than 1,000 products in that time. I’ve tested everything from heated blankets to high chairs, and all my reviews are firm but fair.I’m a self-confessed anthophile, and this isn’t my first time testing flower delivery services. Of course, I love luxury flowers as much as the next person – I have a soft spot for a fussy arrangement or silk ribbon – but I also have a lot of time for budget flowers. In spring, I rarely go past a bucket of £1 supermarket daffodils without picking up a bunch. Whatever your budget, I’m determined to hunt down the best bouquet for your buck.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I needed to invest in several new vases.’Photograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianDuring testing, I received many bunches from the main British flower-delivery services. I first tested for Valentine’s Day, then again for Mother’s Day, and most recently I tested more season-agnostic offerings. In total, I’ve tested 31 arrangements over the three testing periods. My regular courier drivers even asked if everything was OK, as they’ve been delivering enough flowers tosatisfy even Elton John’s needs. The flowers were counted and cut on arrival to condition them, and then arranged into vases and placed around my house. I followed the directions for each bunch where relevant – arranging them and adding flower food as suggested.I kept my eye on each bouquet every day, noting when any flowers began to fade. My house is a draughty Victorian number, and I did fire up the central heating and log burner intermittently to see how the flowers coped. I had all the flowers delivered over the course of two days so I could be sure they all underwent the same conditions (yes, I did need to invest in several new vases – charity shops are great hunting grounds for them).The best flower delivery services in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Iaroslava Zolotko/Getty Images/iStockphotoBest flower delivery overall:Marks & SpencerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianFrom £25 at M&SBouquet tested:roses, lisianthus and antirrhinum bright bouquet (£45)Marks & Spencer has overhauled its flower business and now offers afive-day freshness guaranteeon its bouquets. I’ve tested multiple bouquets throughout my process, including an extravagant Valentine’s Day bouquet, a more modest Mother’s Day and these bright flowers, which are more of an “every occasion” bouquet.Why we love itM&S flowers are undeniably premium quality. The most recent arrangement I tested was made up of 25 stems of bright pinks, reds and corals, and was lovely and fresh, bursting with colour. It also included plenty of deep-green foliage. Every time I’ve tested M&S flowers, many of the blooms have arrived in bud, slowly revealing themselves. This means they last much longer – this particular bouquet stayed fresh for two weeks, providing much cheer on my kitchen island.M&S says it sources as many British flowers as it can, depending on what’s in season. It also uses sustainable packaging. The flowers I tested came in a cardboard box, and the bouquet was wrapped in kraft paper with a form of cellophane wrap over the top.It’s a shame that…there aren’t guaranteed to be more British flowers in the arrangements.Fastest delivery:next dayDelivery cost:freeB Corp certified:noBest budget flower delivery:Scilly FlowersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianFrom £16.50 at Scilly FlowersBouquet tested:five bunches of spray carnations (£28.50)Before you read “carnations” and scroll on, I implore you to stop and think. Often cast as the “filler” in bouquets, Scilly Flowers makes whatever flowers you pick the star of the show. And these flowers are such incredibly good value that I keep having to check that the price is right.Why we love itAll Scilly Flowers stems are grown naturally outdoors without artificial light or heat on the Isles of Scilly. This means that the bouquets on offer often change. While I tested carnations, sometimes you might find different flowers available on Scilly Flowers’ website. I’ve tested enough bouquets from Scilly Flowers to know that whatever you get, it won’t be a disappointment.At Scilly Flowers, the whole farm is making strides in sustainability with low-irrigation initiatives, a solar-powered cold store and postal plane and boat shipping.The flowers themselves are low-effort, maximum joy in flower form. You don’t need any special skills to arrange them because they’re so gloriously simple. Many of the stems came as buds and gradually opened up over the week, which spread the joy for longer.It’s a shame that…Scilly’s flowers tend to sell out fast and aren’t available all year round, but this is understandable on both counts.Fastest delivery: 1st class Royal MailDelivery cost:freeB Corp certified:noBestflower subscription service:Freddie’s FlowersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianFrom £28 at Freddie’s FlowersBouquet tested:showstopper (£41)– seasonal arrangements change on four-weekly cyclesFreddie’s Flowers started as a subscription-only business, but it has since grown to offer one-off deliveries too, and I’ve tested both. The showstopper flowers arrived in a flat-lay box, bundled in recyclable paper along with instructions on how to create your arrangement.Why we love itI love taking the time to arrange the blooms. It’s a chance to get creative, even if only for five minutes. And it’s simple enough to follow the instructions, even if you’re not particularly artistic.I loved the variety of blooms, too: it was clear that thought had gone into creating something dramatic, with even the filler flowers adding dimension and spectacle. In the box I received there were huge gladioli alongside roses and kangaroo paw.Some deliveries contain lilies. Although gorgeous, lilies aren’t ideal for everyone, as they’re poisonous to pets; the subscription boxes can be made lily-free for that reason (although you still need to be cautious around other kinds of flowers, as noted at the top of the article).It’s a shame that…you don’t have much control over your delivery days, and although good value, the one-off arrangement I tested didn’t have as many stems as the showstopper bunch.Fastest delivery: subscription flowers are variable – delivery days are set depending on your postcode;one-off bunchesare available next dayDelivery cost:for subscription flowers, £4; for one-off deliveries, next day £5, standard freeB Corp certified:yesBest same-day flowers:InterfloraView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianFrom £32.50 at InterfloraBouquet tested:luxury pink bouquet (£90)Interflora is effectively a floral matchmaker. You choose from a huge menu of flowers and then it matches you with a florist local to your delivery address. The florist then creates and delivers the arrangement. For testing, I received the luxury pink bouquet – which is exactly what it was. It came in a cardboard vase, hand tied in a cellophane pool of water.Why we love itI love the more personal feeling of receiving a bouquet from a local florist – especially because, as luck would have it, mine came from my favourite florist. Interflora guarantees that arrangements are made to order, and my arrangement certainly seemed fresh. Some of the flowers were lightly scented but not overpowering, which is always a joy.Throughout my tests, Interflora has consistently brought drama and luxury to my front door, and I’m not complaining. The luxury pink bouquet was made up of frilly pink blooms, including roses, lilies and lisianthus. Interflora’s website is somewhat vague on what flowers you’ll receive, probably because it depends on what each florist has available, and my bouquet didn’t include as many roses as the one in the photo on the website. However, the flowers lasted well – perhaps because they hadn’t taken a few days to transport through a courier service; the florist delivered them direct. My arrangement was going strong 10 days after I received it. The lilies, which came in bud, slowly opened and revealed their colour and scent after a few days – a lovely bit of delayed gratification.It’s a shame that…the price isn’t inclusive of the delivery fee. Generally Interflora does stunning flowers, but they aren’t the most competitively priced.Fastest delivery:same day (order before 3pm)Delivery cost:from £10 for same-day delivery, from £7.50 for named-day deliveryB Corp certified:noBest letterbox flowers:Bloom & WildView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianFrom £19 at Bloom & WildBouquet tested:the Maren (£35)Letterbox flowers are the perfect solution if you’re not sure your recipient will be home. They come bundled up “sleeping” – so most flowers are in bud rather than big, blousy blooms. But this just means they unfurl over time, last longer and bring extended joy as you watch them blossom. I’ve tested various letterbox flower delivery services and rate Bloom & Wild as the best: for range, service and quality. It always offers new trend-led arrangements, too.View image in fullscreenThe Bloom & Wild letterbox flowers we tested.Photograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianWhy we love itI was thoroughly impressed by Bloom & Wild’s the Maren. It arrived perky and bright, full of different textures and colours that had me smiling from ear to ear. For the sake of being thorough, I also quality tested Bloom & Wild’s pre-made bouquetthe Adeline(£80), as well asthe Scottie(£37) andthe Hope(£34) in previous testing periods. All bouquets were absolute knockouts. I wonder what Bloom & Wild has been up to behind the scenes: it’s seriously upped its (already strong) game recently. The bouquets not only looked completely stunning, but lasted about 16 days.It’s a shame that…there are no instructions on the best way to arrange the flowers.Fastest delivery:next dayDelivery cost:free, but up to £9 for specific day/morning deliveryB Corp certified:yesThe best of the restView image in fullscreenFlowerbx always delivers huge centrepiece-style flowersFlowerbxView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianFrom £40 at FlowerbxBest for:show-stopping flowersBouquet tested:sage blush hydrangeas, five stems (from £75; now out of season)Flowerbx specialises in single-variety bunches, but does it better than most contenders in the flower market. I’ve tested several Flowerbx samples over the past 12 months, and it’s always these bouquets that my guests comment on consistently. They’re always huge centrepiece-style flowers that are fresh and beautiful. The hydrangeas I received most recently didn’t disappoint: they lasted for weeks and became the focal point of my dining room. I was able to dry them easily afterwards too, which means I can keep enjoying them for months.Itdidn’t make the final cut because …they’re so expensive.

That means you’re not just giving the gift of flowers, but also donating towards the environment. Petalon grows many of its own flowers in Cornwall, and is transparent on the website about which bunches have some, or all, Cornish-grown flowers.The flowers grown on the company’s land are done so without pesticides or artificial fertilisers. Petalon also uses only renewable energy. If that’s not enough, it leaves more than half of its land as a wild habitat. When you go to pay, the website offers you a breakdown of where your money is going.I’ve tested the company’s arrangements several times now, and you can rely on it to be different from anything else on the market.

Look for British-grown flowers where you can, and go for those that are seasonal. Peonies in January are just not a good vibe for the planet.Delivery timesNot all flower-delivery services offer next-day delivery. Check the delivery service offering on the website or underneath each entry above. And some can sneak in the cost on top of the flowers, which ends up making a fairly affordable bunch rather punchy.How to make your flowers last longer at homeCut flowers may last only five days at home, even with all the variables being in their favour. Roses and tulips especially don’t last long. However, other flowers, such as hydrangeas and chrysanthemums, can go for a lot longer.To make your flowers last longer at home, you’ve got to think about care and the environment. Only ever use a clean vase, then trim off a few centimetres from the end of each stem. Cut them at a 45-degree angle to increase the surface area in the water. Remove any foliage on the stem below the water line, and then put them in cool water, mixed with flower food (all decent flowers should come with flower food).12 affordable jewellery brands, worn and rated for style and qualityRead morePick the right spot for your flowers. Spring flowers don’t appreciate being near heat sources. Don’t put them too close to your fruit bowl, either: fruit releases ethylene gas, which makes your flowers wilt more quickly.Tips for buying seasonal flowersAs well as being more sustainable, seasonal flowers will last longer in your home. Knowing what’s in season is the best place to start. If you’re buying flowers in the depths of winter, this means no sunflowers or dahlias are coming your way.Buy your flowers from a local florist, or via an online flower delivery service that says it offers British seasonal flowers. It may take a deep dive to find out what that actually looks like. Flower subscriptions, such as Freddie’s Flowers above, are also a great way to get seasonal flowers that have been grown to order.Zoë Phillimore is ajournalistwith 20 years of experience.She’s tested everything from mattresses to makeup, and she’s slightly obsessed with finding small new businesses to spotlight.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For a festival with childbirth at its religious heart, it is perverse how much of our traditionalChristmasspread isn’t recommended for pregnant women. Pre-pregnancy, this was not something I’d clocked. I was the soft cheese supremo, canape queen – at my happiest with a smoked trout blini in one hand and a champagne flute in the other. Then one day in October, two blue lines appeared on a test result and everything started to change: my body, my future and most pressingly my Christmas.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Don’t get me wrong: no present under the tree can match the gift I’ve got in store. But as a food writer who loves this season, I can’t think of a worse time to be nauseated, exhausted and forbidden by the NHS to eat, drink or do my favourite things to eat, drink or do in winter. I have no alternatives for saunas, skiing and hot baths. I do, however, know enough chefs, bartenders, retailers and producers to create a Christmas feast that is full of wonder, joy and within the NHS guidelines.It goes without saying that the NHS guidelines are guidelines, not gospel, and that you are a woman capable of independent thought and decision making. If you’d like to delve deeper into the data which drives dietary advice for pregnant women, Emily Oster’sExpecting Betteris a great place to start. And if that feels overwhelming along with everything else pregnancy brings – well, that’s exactly what the NHS guidelines are for.ChampagneThe most important of festive drinks, many brands have gone to great lengths to recreate the pop, look and feel of fizz, and while there is no real McCoy, there are many palatable options. According to Olly Smith, author ofWINE: Everything You Need to Know,Kylie Minogue No Alcohol Sparkling Roséoffers great (literal) bang for it’s buck. “It’s tremendous value for a celebratory glass of something which actually tastes decent, fruity and fun,” he says of the bottle, which is under £10 in all supermarkets. If you’re fan of kir royale, trySainsbury’s Alcohol Free Blackcurrant Spritz. “It blew me a way at a recent tasting,” he says.For those who prefer their bubbles bone-dry, there is the world of sparkling tea to discover. These are not “just like champagne” (so don’t let anyone tell you otherwise) but aren’t too sweet, the bubbles are fine, and they do a good job of feeling like a “proper” drink.Copenhagen Sparkling Tea Companysupplies sparkling teas for Selfridges and Fortnum and Mason that are delightfully complex, as are those fromSaicho. They’re not cheap – around £18.99 – but they’re cheaper than the more expensive non-alc sparkling wines.That said, if you don’t like tea, or the idea of a cuppa in your champagne coupe, then your best bet is sparkling wine which has been produced the usual way, then de-alcoholised. That process makes them pricey, but the alcoholic fermentation means they aren’t tooth-numbingly sweet.Noughty Non-Alcoholic Sparkling Chardonnayis the best I’ve tried; Smith swears byBolle Sparkling Rosé, which is double fermented “and doesn’t rely on pumping up the sugar to achieve its nuanced sense of grown-up balance”. And if you really love champagne and English sparkling, you might be better saving your money for when you can drink them – or having half a glass of the real stuff. That’s not NHS advice, but it’s what I’ll be doing come Christmas morning.WineFormer Guardian wine columnist Fiona Beckett now has a Substack calledEat This Drink That, Live Wellwhich is basically a gospel of good times and deliciousness. So when she says she has “yet to come across an alcohol-free wine that matches up to the full-strength version” and that they are “by and large… infuriatingly expensive” I feel no need to do further research. That has also been my experience. There is, however, a consolation prize: “non-alcoholic wine does make a decent mulled wine, so much so that I found myself saying, when I first made this, that I shouldn’t really have a glass before I went out to dinner.”The key, she says, is elderberry juice. “It gives the drink body, but it is quite bitter, so you do need to add [brown] sugar to taste.” For one bottle of non-alc red wine (I’m a fan ofWednesday’s Domaine, which brings body and heft), you’ll need 8 cloves, 2 unwaxed oranges, 330ml elderberry juice and a cinnamon stick, as well as sugar and optional orange bitters. Stick the cloves into the rind of one orange, place it in a small to medium saucepan (you want the liquid to cover the orange), add 125g (4½oz) sugar and the cinnamon stick as well as the bitters, if using. “Bring slowly up to simmering point over a low heat without letting it boil. Take off the heat and leave for 30 minutes to infuse.”If you didn’t mull your own wine when you were drinking, and don’t intend to start now you’re not, there are some pre-made versions. Fellow food writer Olivia Potts swears by Ikea’sVintersaga: a traditional Swedish Christmas drink commonly flavoured with spices like cinnamon, cardamom and ginger. “I begrudgingly drank it hot when I was pregnant,” she recalls, “and now I make special trips to Ikea every year to stock up.”OystersI am no huge fan of oysters. But I have learned to respect their inimitable flavour and the ritual of sharing them with family and friends. There is no substitute for one freshly shucked, but recipes for cooked oysters abound and mean you can still join in on the occasion without fear of poisonous repercussions. Chef Roberta Hall McCarron of theLittle Chartroomin Edinburgh actually prefers them cooked, under a gratin of sauteed spinach, wine, garlic and cheese topped with breadcrumbs. AtApplebee’s, a family-run seafood restaurant in Borough Market, chef Frankie Van Loo tops Maldon oysters with chorizo jam (easy to make, even easier to buy fromDukesHill) and bakes them in the oven. Rick Toogood, co-founder ofPrawn on the Lawnrestaurants in Padstow and London, favours deep-fried oysters with garlic creme fraiche. “Shuck the oysters, removing the meat into a sieve to drain any excess liquid (this will keep the oysters crispy),” he advises. The garlic creme fraiche can be whipped up with shop-bought garlic puree, lemon juice and chopped spring onion. Place a blob of that in the empty shells, top with a deep-fried oyster and garnish with more spring onion or herbs.View image in fullscreenAn oyster cooked in beef fat.Photograph: Jack Spicer Adams/The GuardianIf you can’t stomach an oyster, or don’t feel confident enough in the cooking process, you can still join in with the ceremony with a vegetarian version. Ask your local fishmongers for some empty shells (or head to Etsy, which abounds with them) and follow the advice of Ben Rand, executive chef ofBubala, the cult Middle Eastern vegetarian restaurant in London, whosedebut cookbookis out now. “Rather than trying to emulate an oyster, how about taking endive, filling it with some fresh citrus, crunchy nuts and a citrus puree. It has big flavours, it’s fresh, crunchy and saline, hitting all those touch points of an oyster without trying to be one,” he advises. Helen Graham, author of the forthcoming vegetarian cookbookCentrepiece, suggests roasting off aubergine cubes, tossing them with miso, agave, rice vinegar and ras el hanout, and spooning those into shells with a little creme fraiche and lime zest on top. You don’t need to all eat oysters to cheers shells and knock back something delicious.Paté and charcuterieKnow when you’re beaten, is chef Emily Roux’s take on paté and charcuterie. Cured meats must be cooked before being eaten, according to the NHS. Fine on a pizza, not what you want from a charcuterie board. Paté – all types, including vegetarian and fish as well as meat – is off the NHS menu, unless it’s served piping hot which kills any potential listeria but rather defeats the point of paté. “It’s difficult to recreate the same levels of satisfaction,” observes the chef behind the beloved Michelin-starredCaractèrein west London, so perhaps it’s something worth saving until after the baby’s born.That said, there are some things that might work on melba toast in pâté’s stead. Roux recommends making rillettes with flakes of hot-smoked fish (cold-smoked is verboten), creme fraiche, lemon juice and dill. Graham makes a maitake or shitake mushroom paté that would be as delicious spread hot and fresh as cold. “Fry a load of onions until deeply caramelised, then fry your mushrooms in butter and deglaze with a splash of soy and vinegar (add baharat if you have). Blend it all into a silky paté,” she says. Spread on melba toast, white toasted triangles or whatever you’d spread your regular paté on – though bear in mind your vehicle may need more structural integrity when the paté is hot.Smoked salmon blinis“There are certain combinations of ingredients that seem as if they were made for one another,” Nigel Slater famously wrote in his bookAppetite, and blinis and smoked salmon (or better from anethical and environmental perspective,smoked chalk stream trout) is one of them. Mercifully, most smokeries produce hot-smoked fish as well as cold, which means the flesh has been cooked through in the process. That is kosher, for the NHS. “It’s fully cooked, has the same richness and gentle smokiness, and works beautifully on a blini with creme fraiche and a squeeze of lemon – you don’t feel like you’re missing out at all,” says Max Bergius, founder of theSecret Smokehousein east London.“If you get the big sides of hot-smoked fish, then the flakes in the middle are not dry, so use those” advises Roux. If you’d rather wait until you can have the classic cold-smoked, she suggests serving cooked crab. “It’s a real crowd-pleaser, so if you served that on a blini, or as a starter with bitter leaves and blood orange, everyone would be happy.” Likewise, serving spoonfuls of grilled prawn cocktail on blinis, a la Van Loo at Applebee’s. The most important thing for pregnant women is that they feel don’t feel on the outside, says Roux, who has been pregnant herself over Christmas. “So find something that works for everyone.”Cheese“But what about cheese?” many exclaimed when I announced I was pregnant, as if all cheese was banned for the next nine months. This is untrue. If cheeses are blue, or if they are soft and have a white coating on the outside (the NHS calls these mould ripened), they’re verboten, but hard cheeses (unpasteurised and pasteurised) and soft cheeses that are pasteurised but aren’t mould ripened – mozzarella, feta, ricotta, cream cheese etc – are fair game.That leaves you with a lot of options, says Bronwen Percival, who runs the legendaryNeal’s Yard Dairyand has been pregnant at Christmas. “Appleby’s cheshire(this was my pregnancy go-to) is a perfectly balanced light and crumbly texture with juicy acidity and a warm dairy freshness.Coolea– an extra-aged gouda-style cheese from West Cork – is a real crowd-pleaser, with burnt toffee sweetness and a chewy, almost crystalline texture.” Both are artisan cheeses, available in all good independent cheese shops. A good, aged parmesan deserves a place on the cheeseboard too; crunchy, savoury and nutty, it’s not just for cooking.If you cannot bear the thought of Christmas without camembert, fear not: it just needs to be thoroughly cooked. “Stud with garlic cloves and rosemary, bake into boiling and serve with grissini. It’s super Christmassy,” says Roux.View image in fullscreenRukmini Iyer’s celebratory tomato bread and baked camembert.Photograph: Yuki Sugiura/The Guardian. Food styling: Valerie Berry. Prop styling: Louie Waller..CocktailsAgain, this is not something I’d clocked pre-pregnancy but many bars assume non-drinkers will want iced tea or spritzes. It’s winter. I want something strong and warming, not summery and full of ice. Step forward the no-groni, or faux-groni, or whatever you call a trinity of non-alc gin, non-alc vermouth and non-alc Campari. What it can’t deliver on booze, it can deliver on punchy flavours, and the look and feel of the real deal. Monica Berg of Tayēr + Elementary in London recommendsAmàrico Rossoas the replacement for vermouth; inThe New Bar, a zero-alcohol bar in San Francisco, they suggestLyre’s Aperitif Rosso. Sanbitter or Crodino are like Campari, but they’re sparkling so you’d be veering into negroni sbagliato terrirory; better to useAecorn bitter,Lyre’s Italian OrangeorMonin Bitter Syrupif you can find it. As for 0% gin, I favour Tanqueray.Not everyone is a negroni fan. The best non-alcoholic cocktail I’ve tried this year, hands down, is the pineapple picante fromEl Bar de Cavita, a subterranean Mexican bar and mezcaleria in London’s Marylebone. Limited experience has taught me the spicer the drink, the less noticeable the lack of alcohol, and this gratifyingly simple recipe really delivers. For one, it’s 50ml pineapple juice, shaken with 20ml each of lime juice, agave syrup andCrossip Blazing Pineappleand two slices of jalapeno, says founder and chef Adriana Cavita.Though I initially dismissedBotivoas a summer drink, several cocktails have proved otherwise. At Barbarella in Canary Wharf, I enjoyed it in a white negroni instead of Suze, and I’ve even made their clove sour at home – though instead of the ginger clove tea, I usedMother Root. Mother Root is this fiery, gingery aperitif created by a woman who worked in wine and wanted something just as complex to drink while pregnant. It has been recommended to me by almost every mum-to-be I know, and for good reason. Being gingery and spicy, it’s wintery by default, and it adds kick to mocktails (I like theirclementine coastandclouds and honey). It’s not cheap, though (none of these special alc-free drinks are) so if you’re the only one on the mocktails, you might want to buy pre-mixed. I like Black Lines non-alcoholicShirley Temple. It’s fun, it’s fizzy, it’s laced with blood orange, ginger and bitters, and by the time you’ve placed a fun glace cherry on top everyone will be clamouring for a sip.BaileysI have nothing. They have nothing. Just think how sweet it will taste next Chrismas.Explore more on these topicsFoodChristmasChristmas food and drinkPregnancyFamilyHealth & wellbeingParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why?From Quality Street to Toblerone to the Terry’s classic, festive treats are becoming more of a luxury – and it’s not just down to the price of cocoaHilary OsborneThu 18 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 10.04 ESTShareYou’re right – it is smaller. The Terry’s Chocolate Orange on shop shelves thisChristmasweighs 12g less than it did this time last year. That’s a decrease in size of 8% – not as big a cut as when the product lost 10% of its mass in 2016, but a further whittling away of a favourite Christmas treat.Prices have been going up too, although it’s been a series of increases. Figures from market researchers Assosia show that across the big four supermarkets, the full price of aChocolateOrange has increased from £1.24 in December 2022 to about £2.25 today – a rise of 81%. If you factor in the size reduction, you’re actually paying 96% more.And it’s not just the Chocolate Orange. Other Christmas favourites have also been shrinking in the UK –Toblerone and Quality Street boxes among them– while some snacks are now described as“chocolate flavour” rather than chocolate, because they contain more palm oil and shea oil than cocoa.It’s a similar trend in other countries. Julia Buech, senior consumer foods analyst at Rabobank, says across western Europe, prices for bars have increased more than 50% since 2021 and by 18% since last year. “A dramatic shift for a category built on affordable indulgence,” she says.View image in fullscreenSupply and demand … Toblerone is among the other Christmas favourites that have been shrinking in the UK.Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesSo why are we paying more for less? Simply, it’s the rising cost of almost everything that goes into producing chocolate: cocoa, sugar, milk, packaging, transport and wages. Mondelez International, one of the biggest chocolate makers in the world and the owner of Cadbury and Toblerone, says it is experiencing “significantly higher input costs across our supply chain”. Not only do ingredients cost “far more” than previously, “other costs like energy and transport also remain high”.The climate crisis is at the heart of ingredient price rises. More than 60% of the world’s cocoa comes from Ivory Coast and Ghana in west Africa, and in 2023 these areas were hit by extreme rainfall, which led to an outbreak of black pod disease. That was followed by severe drought and a resurgence of swollen shoot virus, which is transmitted by mealy bugs. “To get rid of it you have to rip the tree out, treat the soil and then plant a new tree,” says Chris Jaccarini, food and farming analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. While eventually new plants may be good for yields, they have to survive the first few years and young trees are much more susceptible to climate stresses.Falling supply has been coupled with growing demand from countries including India and China. As a result cocoa prices reached a record high of $12,000 (£9,000) a tonne late last year, which was three times where they were in 2023. Cocoa remains twice as expensive as in 2022.Jason Archie-Acheampong, sustainable sourcing lead for cocoa at the Fairtrade Foundation, says price volatility is a huge problem. In the current system many farmers are unable to invest in changes that might help iron out the ups and downs in cocoa yields. Fairtrade is designed to give them some money to attempt to mitigate the effects of global heating. He gives the example of “planting shade trees that can protect cocoa trees from the scorching sun”, but outside the Fairtrade scheme “farmers are ultimately price takers – they have to take what they are being offered,” he says.Sugar prices peaked in 2023, but while the global commodity value has since dipped, it remains high in Europe where 50% of supply is made from beet sugar. In the UK, sugar beet crops are threatened by aphids, which have been able to survive warmer winters, and beet moth, which also thrives in higher temperatures. At one farm inSuffolk, beet moth reduced yields by 25% this year. Cane sugar prices were pushed up by extreme weather in Brazil, India and Thailand.View image in fullscreenPrice rises … Farmers breaking up harvested cocoa pods in Ivory Coast.Photograph: Philippe Lissac/Godong/Getty ImagesThe Food & Drink Federation, which represents UK manufacturers, says there have beenother pressuresincluding a new packaging tax and increases in the national insurance contributions they pay for workers. The minimum wage has also gone up, and energy and transport costs have risen. Between January 2020 and September 2025, its members’ outlays, excluding labour, regulatory costs or costs of finance, rose by 39%.Buech says similar is happening elsewhere: “Labour costs in particular are climbing in Europe, with minimum wages going up in many countries.”And in the UK there is another factor. Since October, retailers have been banned from including these products in multibuys (several years ago, one supermarket offered abuy-one-get-two-free deal on Chocolate Oranges).But the big makers at least have the benefits of scale. Adam Levy, founder ofthe Chocolate Professorwebsite, says the rising cost of cocoa is more noticeable in the products of the small producers who “buy in smaller volumes and do not have the leverage in purchasing and volume efficiency in production”. He says 70% cocoa bars have seen the biggest increase in price.That said, there are some special offers, which are bringing prices down a bit. And if you get a move on you might be able to snap up the last of theChocolate Orange Advent calendars from B&M– at 50p for 106g, that’s the price of Christmases long past.This article was amended on 18 December 2025. An earlier version said sugar prices are 60% higher than they were in 2022; to clarify, this referred to retail prices.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It may well be that you already have a drink that you traditionally like to sip on after dinner (or lunch), and who am I to tell you that needs to change? Even so, I have a few ideas for drinks you might like to try instead.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Let’s start with the classics. There are many different sorts of port, including white and rosé, but you’re more likely to come across ruby and tawny ports atChristmastime. I like an LBV, a port that’s aged for up to six years in barrel, especially with cheese or anything chocolatey.Another bottle you’re likely to see at Christmas – and one I’ve finally got my family on board with – is sherry. Specifically, for us, pedro ximénez. It’s generally the most intense and sweet of the sherries, and made from grapes that are dried in the sun. The evaporation of the water in the grapes concentrates the sugars and flavours, which results in an intense and flavourful wine. I also like to use it when I’m making tiramisu and can’t find any marsala. (FYI, I likeSophie Wyburd’s hazelnut tiramisu recipe, which tastes like aKinder Bueno.)Or how about something completely different? Elleisha Adriana, head of wine atElephant, a new east London restaurant with an entirely Italian wine list, loves arecioto della Valpolicella, a sweet red dessert wine that’s also made using dried grapes: “It tastes like Christmas fruit cake, with slightly dried cherry, brown sugar and baking spice notes,” she says. “It also works amazingly with rich, salty blue cheese – the addition of the recioto della Valpolicella feels as if you’ve completed the whole dessert.”Sweet French wines also deserve a look-in. For instance,rivesaltes, a naturally sweet fortified wine that’s a blend of grapes (typically grenache blanc, grenache gris, macabeu and malvoisie du Roussillon) from Languedoc-Roussillon. Also from the Roussillon area isbanyuls, which is made from grenache varieties. Both go wonderfully alongside Christmas cakes and puddings, as well as anything intensely chocolatey, be that a Quality Street or an indulgent rocky road.Sparkling wines often get overlooked in favour of these deep, rich dessert wines, but might I also turn your attention to demi-sec champagne? Where champagne brut contains less than 12g sugar per litre, demi-sec has between 32g and 50g (there’s also a growing trend for similar products inEnglish sparkling wine). A glass of this will do very nicely alongside lemon tarts, pavlovas or anything with fresh fruit that you might serve post-lunch.Four bottles that are made for dessertsCockburn’s LBV£17 Ocado, 20%.

Out of the corner of an eye I spied an old folder of pudding menus, all stained and tattered. A wonder at how this might have escaped notice was soon dispelled – unsurprising, really, given the usual state of my desk and shelves – and the page on which it fell open revealed the scribbles for a midwinter pudding menu. And, just like that, as if the scent rose from the page itself, came a memory of an almond, chocolate, walnut and prune tart being lifted from the oven, all mahogany hued and with a few bubbles bursting from the pieces of chocolate among the prunes peeking out.My appetite for almond tart has never waned; be it in a restaurant kitchen or at home, an almond tart is nigh-on inevitable. When I was younger, almond tarts were often made with ready-ground almonds and usually invigorated by a drop or two of almond essence, because they were often shy of flavour. But then bags of whole marcona almonds from Spain began to arrive, and quickly usurped any notion of baking with any other almond. Shaped like teardrops and almost milky in colour, delicate, buttery and freshly ground, these almonds imbue a tart with a superb quality and flavour. The benefit of not having to blind bake a tart case balanced the need to bake the tart on a rack sat in a tray to catch any butter and almond oil-infused tears released while baking.My fondness for baking means I have been on the pastry section of pretty much every restaurant I’ve ever cooked in. And, somehow, an almond tart always seemed to have been on the menu. Some remained plain, some were prettied up with sliced fruit such as apple, apricot and pear; another great favourite was to stud the tart with prunes. To partner those marcona almonds, the prunes had to be from Agen in south-western France, famed for their yielding texture and depth of taste attained by a partial drying (mi-cuit). So much so, in fact, that they’ve been granted protectedstatus.That same region of France is also home to some very fine walnuts, which also found their way into those tarts, as did shards of bitter chocolate. When I baked these atAlastair Little’s eponymous restaurant in Soho, we steeped Agen prunes in armagnac, but to spare the cook’s purse in these straitened times, amontillado sherry also pleases greatly. The resulting tart was well received and duly bestowed upon the restaurant menu and at home. As is the way of recipes, other variations claimed centre stage until a friend gave me a nudge and suddenly a sleeping beauty was awakened to be presented here.Almond, chocolate and prune tartMakes1 x 23cm tart150g cold unsalted butter250g ‘00’ flour, sifted75g icing sugarSea salt1 egg, beaten100g chopped walnuts12 Agen prunes, halved and stoned100g 70% dark chocolate, choppedFor the frangipane250g softened unsalted butter200g caster sugar2 eggs, beaten250g whole marcona almondsBest made early on, the pastry is a classic rubbing together to a fine crumb of the cold butter with the ‘00’ flour, icing sugar and a pinch of sea salt. Add to this the beaten egg and a tablespoon of cold water, knead deftly into a smooth dough and shape into a disc, then cover and refrigerate for at least an hour.The frangipane is made by mixing the softened butter with the caster sugar, then gradually adding the two beaten eggs. Grind the whole marcona almonds to a fine crumb, then mix those in. Again, this is best refrigerated.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to fit a 22-23cm tin with a removable base. Gather up the rolled pastry on to the pin and lay in the tin. Lift the edges gently and let the disc fall into the case, then push the edges downwards, pressing with your fingertips to ensure the pastry squarely lines the case. Pinch together any cracks.Put spoonfuls of the frangipane in the tin, but do not smooth. Push the chopped walnuts evenly over the tart, then lightly press in the halved prunes. Finally, strew the tart with the chopped chocolate, pressing it down lightly.Put the tart case on a rack, put the rack in an oven tray and transfer to the oven. Lower the temperature to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2 and bake for an hour, checking occasionally to see if the tart needs turning so it colours evenly. Lower the oven temperature to 120C (100C fan)/260F/gas ½ and bake for a further 15 minutes. The tart is best eaten warm with a jug of the best Jersey cream.Jeremy Lee is chef/co-owner ofQuo Vadis in London, and author of Cooking: Simply and Well, for One or Many, published by HarperCollins at £30.

You decide who is sweet and who is sourFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 18 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 10.19 ESTShareThe prosecution: ParveenJoe says‘buns’ covers all sweet things in the north,but I worry he’ll bring me home a burger bunMy husband, Joe, lumps all sweet things into one category, and I find it confusing. Sometimes he’ll go out to get something sweet for breakfast at the bakery, but I never know what he will come back with. I’ll ask him for a sweet pastry, and he’ll bring back a cake. A cake isn’t a pain au chocolat. They’re not the same.More annoyingly, he has this quirk where he calls all sweet things “buns”, no matter what they are. I don’t know why he doesn’t call them by their proper names. I’ll tell him I fancy dessert in the evening and he’ll reply: “I’ll grab us some buns on the way back from work.” To me that sounds as if he’s going to come back with burger buns.Joe’s approach to food terminology is chaos. He needs to learn from supermarkets: it’s important to clearly categorise your food. Joe claims “buns” can mean any type of cake, and that in Rotherham, where his family is from, they call all cakes, biscuits and sponges “buns”. He defends this practice by saying the term “cake” doesn’t make any sense to him either, because you can have fishcakes and savoury cakes. I think that’s a false equivalence.His habit also causes me anxiety. I live in eternal fear that when I am longing for a lovely sweet dessert, he will proffer a dry burger bun.I don’t want to come across as anti-northern, but I’d never heard of using ‘bun’ to mean all desserts before and I don’t believe itI don’t think Joe appreciates the wide range of desserts because he is a vegan. Maybe he lumps all these very different sweet treats into the “bun” category because he doesn’t know what real desserts taste like and can’t distinguish one from the other.I don’t want to come across as anti-northern, but I’d never heard of using “bun” to mean all desserts before and I don’t believe it. Also, Joe was born in Watford; it’s just his family who live up north. And while it’s very kind that he picks up sweet treats for me at the bakery, it’s often wasteful, as I end up eating pastries and cakes I didn’t want because he can’t seem to distinguish between different types of sweet things.“Bun” works if you’re referring to an iced bun, but to put a pastry or dessert in that category is a step too far.The defence: JoeRegional differences in language are all part of the fun – plus, surely sugar is sugar?Parveen is right about a couple of things. I’m generally less interested in sweets than her. And I don’t really eat sweet things for breakfast. I do plain oats and that’s it.So I’ve had to learn from her that a cake for breakfast isn’t normal, and if Parveen says “I want something sweet from the bakery,” she wants a pastry. But if I’ve been sent out to buy a pastry and they don’t have any left, I’ll just pick up a cake, biscuits or chocolate to replace it. Parveen will get annoyed. She’ll say it’s not an adequate substitution, and that it’s “random” to replace a pastry with biscuits. But they’re both sweet.Parveen hates it when I say “I’ll get a bun on the way home” because she doesn’t know what I mean by it. But sweet things are sweet things, and I’ll get whatever I see in the supermarket. I do try to get what she likes, but surely sugar is sugar, so what does it really matter? I don’t think it’s got anything to do with me being vegan either.I’m a plastic northerner, that’s true, but I think having regional differences in language is all part of the funI do get that there are differences, but I use “bun” to describe cakes, cupcakes and other sweet treats. I hate the word “cupcake” and also the term “baked goods”.I’ve got memories of turning up at my granny’s house at the weekend and eating an iced bun or a cake with chocolate icing and sprinkles, or a mini Bakewell pudding. My mum and gran would call all of them buns. I recognise that they are all very different, but that’s what I grew up doing.I wasn’t brought up in Rotherham; I’m a plastic northerner, that’s true, but I think having regional differences in language is all part of the fun. When I brought this disagreement up with my mum recently, I pointed to a cake and she said, “Yes that’s a sponge bun.” Parveen was even more confused.We’ve been together for four years, and in that time I’ve learned that sweet substitutions need to be as closely related to one another as possible, but I don’t see anything wrong with saying “bun” to describe them all. A sweet is a sweet.The juryof Guardian readersShould Joe be more specific when referring to sweet treats?I am all for maintaining proper regional slang, but Joe’s statement “a sweet is a sweet” feels like weaponised incompetence … Joe’s guilty, but only just. Maybe a compromise: Parveen could embrace the chaos a little bit if Joe stopped pretending not to understand what a pastry is!Rich, 31Parveen should appreciate Joe’s efforts, even if they aren’t perfect every time. And perhaps Joe could show a little more curiosity about what she fancies that night to avoid the burger bun anxiety.Ellie, 28Parveen “lives in eternal fear” over what sweet treat her husband will show up with, instead of asking specifically for what she fancies. Joe isn’t a fan of sweet treats and needs clear guidance when asked to procure some.Polly, 34Parveen should tell Joe, like you’d tell the online grocery, “No substitutions.” Or she could go with him to the bakery, and use it as a teachable moment. It’s quite clear that for Joe, “bun” always means a sweet baked good, and Parveen should just deal with that (much like I’ve had to learn, as an expat living in this country, that “pudding” means dessert).Katherine, 60Parveen should count herself lucky that she has a lovely partner who bothers to pick up buns for her after work. What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.Jethro, 54Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: Should Joestop calling anything that is sweet a bun?The poll closes on Tuesday 23 December at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked ifwannabe influencer Marielle should stop using her friend for content.99%of you said yes – Marielle is guilty1%of you said no – Marielle is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Write down anything you’re missing and need to buy.Do some DIY troubleshootingDo a walk around your home to check things off: are all the lightbulbs working in your guest room? Is there somewhere for people to put muddy boots? Are there enough chairs for everyone in each living space, or at least scatter cushions for younger guests to perch on? Folding chairs that can be stashed away afterwards can be useful.View image in fullscreenFolding chair£16 at ArgosPrevent a cooking stress bottleneckView image in fullscreenTiming is everything when it comes to making a feast.Photograph: 10’000 Hours/Getty ImagesCreate a clear timetable for cooking spreads, picky bits and of course, the Christmas dinner. A productivity planner notebook may help you to lay it all out. “Write down what you want to cook, then work backwards to the prep,” says professional host of theSeasonal Supper Club, Lucy Turnbull. “Consider fridge space and how long each element takes to make. If it’s starting to feel overwhelming, dial it back; fewer well-executed dishes are much better than abundance.”View image in fullscreenProductivity planner£21.25 at PapierDon’t fret about clashing dinnerwareOnce you’ve decided what you’re eating and when, check well ahead of time that you have more than enough crockery, glassware, cookware and cutlery to serve it on. Rather than worrying that new additions won’t match, opt for statement plates, serving dishes and colourful glasses that make it all look like an artful mix. These La Gent coupes are a playful choice, while some printed plates would make a lovely touch to helm the table at each end. I like these Bitossi porcelain ones. Cutlery wise, if you’re falling short, MG&Co does gorgeous styles with colourful handles, like the salad servers below, which make the mismatching look feel intentional.For dressing the table, you can put a bow on pretty much anything to add some festive cheer. It can be reused and won’t make a mess that needs cleaning up, like flowers or confetti. The John Lewis velvet ribbons below make for a pretty and festive colour combo.If you have lots of different ribbons that look good together, try personalising your guests’ place settings by tying a ribbon around their napkin to help them remember which is theirs and save you washing them after each meal. You can do the same to prevent glasses from getting muddled with charms like Anthropologie’s chilli and olive motif ones.View image in fullscreenCoupes, set of two£45 at La GentView image in fullscreenDinner plate (each)£55 at LibertyView image in fullscreenSalad servers£60 at MG&CoView image in fullscreenVelvet gift ribbon£8 at John LewisView image in fullscreenCocktail charms, set of two£12 at AnthropologieBuy or borrow beddingIt’s worth getting the nicest bedding you can if you plan to repeat host (try ouredit of the best bedding styles); otherwise, see what you can borrow.

Consider the fridge neutral territory if guests are staying, but make sure you separate meal ingredients from free-for-all snacks.For more, see our guide tothe best Christmas drinks, from gingerbread rum to mulled roseBe clear on timingsAs the saying sort of goes, guests and fish go off after three days, but whatever the length of stay, be clear ahead of time about arrival and departure times: eg “Do come from teatime on Christmas Eve until after breakfast on the 27th.” If you’re still drowning in leftovers on departure day, put together little takeaway tupperware boxes of food that will keep to give guests a gentle nudge out the door.View image in fullscreenFood containers, set of 17£5 at IkeaFor more, readhow to host the perfect Christmas dinnerHayley Spencer is a journalist and editor with 15 years’ experience writing on topics spanning style, beauty and wellnessIllustration: Sandra Navarro/Guardian DesignChristmas shopping can be tough – so we spent months finding the perfect presents for everyone on your list.

The granite stones of the circle are luminous in this sombre landscape, like pale, inquisitive ghosts gathered round to see what we’re up to. Above us, a sea of withered bracken and gorse rises to Carn Kenidjack, the sinister rock outcrop that dominates the naked skyline. At night, this moor is said to be frequented by pixies and demons, and sometimes the devil himself rides out in search of lost souls.Map of standing stone locations, CornwallUnbothered by any supernatural threat, we are gazing seawards, towards the smudges on the horizon that are the distant Isles of Scilly. The clouds crack open and a flood of golden light falls over the islands. My companion, archaeoastronomer Carolyn Kennett, and I gasp. It is marvellous natural theatre which may have been enjoyed by the people who built this circle 4,000 years ago.We have met at Tregeseal to talk about the winter solstice. Carolyn’s work focuses on the relationship of Cornwall’s prehistory with the sky, and she describes the whole Land’s End peninsula as an ancient winter solstice landscape. This, she says, is because of the spine of granite that runs south-west along the peninsula, towards the midwinter sunset. If, for example, you stand at winter solstice by Chûn Quoit – the mushroom-shaped burial chamber high on the moors south of Morvah – you will see the sun set over Carn Kenidjack on the south-western horizon. And likely this is exactly as Chûn Quoit’s Neolithic builders intended.View image in fullscreenThe Tregeseal East standing stone.Photograph: Paul Williams/AlamyCarolyn suggests that Tregeseal stone circle was deliberately sited to allow people to view the midwinter sun setting behind the Isles of Scilly. “Seen from here, Scilly is a liminal space. On a clear day with high pressure, the isles look close up and just pop. On other days, they’re simply not there. The circle builders could have viewed Scilly as an otherworldly place, perhaps a place of the dead, associated with the winter solstice and the rebirth of the light.”Where better to celebrate the return of the light than on the Land’s End peninsula, which points towards the setting point of the sun on the year’s shortest day?We thread through the darkening russet moor past prehistoric burial mounds and heaps of mining slag to a mysterious monument, which may be the UK’s only ancient row of holed stones. Unlike the stone at Mên-an-Tol, their better-known sister a few miles away, it’s impossible to crawl through the Kenidjack holed stones; these holes are barely big enough to fit my hand through and very low to the ground. Archaeologists remain baffled.Carolyn’s theory is that the row might have worked as a kind of winter solstice countdown calendar, with the rising sun shining through the holes from late October until December and creating varying beams of light in the stones’ shadows. “Feeling the warmth of that golden beam of sunlight in the cold, dark moor gave me a visceral experience of how prehistoric people might have perceived winter solstice,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe Merry Maidens.Photograph: Charlie Newlands/AlamyToo many ancient sites are aligned to the rising or setting of the sun at midwinter or midsummer for it to be a coincidence. It makes sense that prehistoric farmers, who relied on the sun for light, warmth and the growth of crops, would want to track the sun’s movement. But in the 21st century, the darkness of this time of year still weighs on our spirits, and so we welcome the winter solstice, that darkest day of all before the hours of light begin to grow again. And where better to celebrate the return of the light than on the Land’s End (West Penwith) peninsula, which points towards the setting point of the sun on the year’s shortest day?Montol revives the old Cornish custom of guise dancing, with its elaborate masks and costumes, traditional carolling and music of pipe, drum and fiddleA bitter easterly is gusting, and eerie moaning rises from unseen cows as I tramp through soggy clover to pay a visit to the Boscawen-Ros stone, keeping watch as it has done for thousands of years above the peninsula’s south coast. It is just one of scores of prehistoric stones that stand alone or in pairs or circles all over the peninsula; less than a mile away are the famous Merry Maidens, dancers turned to stone for breaking the Sabbath. I think about how long the stone has persisted here, enjoying its view of the Celtic Sea and English Channel: where once Neolithic coracles would have floated, now the container ships and the Scilly ferry pass by.Christopher Morris’s mesmerising filmA Year in a Field, which documents 12 months in the life of this stone, draws attention to the power of its still and silent presence in the ever-changing landscape. “And I deliberately started and ended the film with winter solstice,” he tells me, “because it is a moment of pure hope – the promise of the ending of darkness and a bright new year ahead.”View image in fullscreenPenzance’s Montol midwinter festival.Photograph: Guy Corbishley/AlamyOn 21 December, all over West Penwith, people will be marking midwinter by walking to stone circles and holy wells, to hill forts and ancient beacons.Carolyn Kennettwill beleading a guided walkto Chûn Quoit to observe the sun setting over Carn Kenidjack. Morris will walk to the Boscawen-Ros stone, as he does every winter solstice, in a sort of ritual of reflection and renewal. Later he, like thousands of others, will crowd into Penzance forMontol, a midwinter festival that dates only to 2007 but revives the very old Cornish custom of guise dancing, with its elaborate masks and costumes, traditional carolling and music of pipe, drum and fiddle.Morris calls Montol “a wild night of misrule” – mischief and taboo-breaking are positively encouraged. The sun (in papier-mache form) will be set ablaze, while revellers disguised in animal masks, foliate heads or veils will dance triumphantly around it. There will be a herd of ’obby ’osses (hobby horses, including one called Penglaz and another called Pen Hood), dragons, fire-dancers and riotous merry-making. “A lot of sprout-throwing, too,” Morris adds. At 9.30pm those still standing will parade the Mock (the Yule log), flaming torches in hand, down Chapel Street to the sea. It is a fittingly uproarious and darkly magical celebration to welcome back the light.In enchanted West Penwith, where rings of dancers were turned to stone and the witches once lit solstice fires in the moorland cromlechs, the tradition of folklore, storytelling and community ritual is still very much alive. And especially now, at midwinter.Fiona Robertson is the author of Stone Lands, published by Robinson at £25. To support the Guardian buy a copy fromguardianbookshop.com.

The 28-year-old human rights activist, who was with her five-year-old son, was accused of “illicit association” with gang members and jailed without evidence.Three weeks later, her family received a call from the prison authorities to collect the body of her newborn baby. The cause of death has not been investigated and the family has no idea what happened, or whether Hernández – who is believed to remain in prison – received any postnatal care.Cases such as Hernández’s are far from uncommon in El Salvador’s prisons, and throughout the world. Pregnant women are often kept in deplorable conditions and denied medical attention; some miscarry, others go into labour and give birth alone in a cell. Some babies die behind bars.Countries think it’s a small number of women so it’s not an issue, but that’s not trueSabrina Mahtani, Women Beyond Walls“Prison is not a good environment for women, let alone someone who is pregnant,” says Sabrina Mahtani, a British-Zambian lawyer and member ofWomen Beyond Walls, a global collaboration dedicated to combating the over-incarceration of women and girls. “There’s so much research that shows how harmful it is.“Many prisons were built with men in mind, so women were an afterthought. There are lots of issues around violence, a lack of resources, a lack of sanitation, overcrowding, but also a real lack of gender-responsive care.”It is 15 years since the UN general assembly adopted theBangkok Rulesfor the treatment of female prisoners and non-custodial measures for female offenders. The first set of international guidelines to address the situation of incarcerated women, they were formulated in response to the growing female prison population worldwide. Since 2000, the number of women and girls in prison hasrisen by 57%, compared with a 22% increase in the male prison population over the same period.View image in fullscreenA prison in Colombia, South America. UN guidelines that prison should be a last resort for pregnant women are flouted around the world.Photograph: Anadolu/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesThe UN rules state that prison should be a last resort for pregnant women and that non-custodial sentences should always be considered first. They also say that “instruments of restraint shall never be used on women during labour, during birth and immediately after birth”.But the guidelines are consistently flouted around the world. “This isn’t seen as a global gender-equality priority,” says Mahtani. “It’s not visible, and there’s a lot of stigma and stereotyping. Countries think it’s a small number of women so it’s not an issue, but that’s not true.”The jailing of pregnant women is also of huge concern, she adds, because of a lack of data and information, especially in poorer countries in the global south where prisons tend to have fewer resources and there is less media attention on them and unreliable access by civil society organisations.In El Salvador, where the female prison population is estimated to have doubled since 2022 andhas increased nearly sevenfold since 2000, conditions for pregnant prisoners and newborns are “really critical”, says Zaira Navas, a lawyer and member of Cristosal, a human rights organisation in the country.Our organisation has documented miscarriages and the death of four babies … there will be moreZaira Navas, CristosalFamily visits have been banned since 2020, and civil society organisations are denied access to prisons. However, interviews with women who have spent time behind bars, carried out by Cristosal, reveal that they are subjected to beatings and torture and denied basic supplies. Some resort to having sex with prison guards to get food, sanitary products or medicine.“Women have to climb up to three floors to get to cells, and do not receive adequate prenatal care,” says Navas. “Our organisation has documentedmiscarriages and the death of four babies, but obviously this is just what we’ve recorded. There will be more.” She also has reports of women who were shackled to hospital beds during labour and gave birth watched by male prison guards.View image in fullscreenA prisoner and her daughter at Prey Sar prison in Phnom Penh. Human rights monitors report overcrowding and lack of access to basic items in Cambodian prisons.Photograph: Pring Samrang/ReutersData from the World Prison Brieflists Cambodiaas having the second-highest prison occupancy level in the world behind the Republic of the Congo. At the end of 2024,18 of the 19 prisonsmonitored byLicadho, a Cambodian human rights organisation, exceeded their official capacity, with 11 prisons at an occupancy rate of at least 200%.Women are particularly vulnerable to overcrowding, says Naly Pilorge, outreach director of Licadho. “Women in prisons, most of whom have not yet been sentenced with a final verdict, suffer from atrocious conditions stemming from severe overcrowding. There is rarely enough space to fully lie down in prisons and there is a chronic lack of access to basic items.”Pregnant prisoners, she adds, have been handcuffed to hospital beds before giving birth. There are worrying conditions for raising a newborn when they go back to prison, as a report ofa five-month-old baby dyingof pneumonia and severe malnutrition in prison in 2020 shows. The mother was detained for possessing a sachet of methamphetamine worth 10,000 riel (£1.90) and was eight months pregnant when she was sent to prison in 2019, according to Licadho.In Zambia, Marjorie Banda, a pastor and businesswoman, remembers being in a cell with pregnant women during her six months in prison in 2019. The doors were locked overnight and the keys taken to the men’s prison. When someone went into labour at night, the women were left to fend for themselves.“We would call the names of our officers because we didn’t know what to do,” says Banda. “We would be pleading. Others were praying. Others were hitting the ground and the doors, screaming: ‘Please come, somebody’s in labour!’”Such events also happen in richer countries. In 2019,Rianna Cleary, then 18, lost her daughter, Aisha, after giving birth alone in a prison cell at Bronzefield prison in the UK. Cleary’s calls for help when she was in labour were ignored for 12 hours and she was forced to bite through the umbilical cord to cut it.View image in fullscreenA protest outside HMP Bronzefield Prison in Surrey, UK, where an 18-year-old lost her daughter after giving birth alone.Photograph: Elizabeth DalzielSome women have chosen to use their experiences of being pregnant in prison to instigate change. In the US, Pamela Winn, who lay in a pool of blood for five hours after miscarrying in her prison cell, set up her own organisation,RestoreHer, after she was released.Winn has successfully pushed for legislation that bans shackling and solitary confinement for those who are pregnant in 24 states. Now she is working to pass legislation to end prison births across the US.In 2020, Nora Calandra was appointed undersecretary for labour and community inclusion of people in conflict with the law for Argentina’s Buenos Aires province, a role that looks into issues encountered by current and former prisoners.I question whether women should be criminalised for many issues in the first placeSabrina MahtaniHer journey to this position started when she discovered she was pregnant a couple of months after she was sentenced to six years in prison in 2010.For the first six months of her pregnancy, she was monitored by prison authorities. When it came to giving birth, the guards – one male, one female – chained her legs to the hospital bed so she was unable to move. They stayed in the room, watching her in labour.Hospital staff performed a caesarean section to deliver her baby, a son. Thirteen years later, she still does not know why that happened. While she was still groggy from the anaesthetic, they offered to sterilise her so she could no longer have children. She said no.“Why would you want to have more children, if you’re a prisoner?” came the response.For years, Calandra accepted that the treatment she received was part of her punishment for committing a crime. It was only after she was released that she could speak about what she had gone through.“What I experienced was obstetric violence. What I experienced should never have happened, but this is what women in prison go through,” she says.Calandra started studying and advocating for herself and her son, and others, while still in prison. After she was released she founded an organisation tosupport people released from prisonand help them find work.View image in fullscreenPregnant women in a prison in Brazil, where house arrest has now been introduced as an alternative to being held on remand before trial.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesHer experiences informed theguidelines around childbirthin detention for Buenos Aires, which were published in 2020. She acknowledges that women are still experiencing obstetric violence, and being forcibly sterilised, in the country.Other countries haveintroduced policies for pregnant women in the criminal justice system. In Sierra Leone, bail regulations passed in 2017 require courts to consider alternatives to detention if a defendant is a primary caregiver, pregnant or a breastfeeding mother.How many women are in prison and on death row around the world? – in chartsRead moreIn some countries, such as Brazil, house arrest has been introduced as an alternative to being held on remand before trial, particularly for pregnant women or women with dependent children.Other countries, including Georgia, Russia and Vietnam, allow for deferral of sentences for pregnant women.Experts and people with experience of prison argue that, in most cases, pregnant women should not be in prison at all. “I question whether women should be criminalised for many issues in the first place,” says Mahtani, whose organisation has releaseda report on laws criminalising women for povertyor gender discrimination.“Community-based solutions that address the root causes of women coming into contact with the justice system – for example, poverty, abuse and drugs – are really what we should be investing in.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentWomen in prisonPrisonsWomen (Society)PregnancyWomen's rights and gender equalityPrisons and probationUS prisonsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Guardian was told that people had been beaten and left for hours without food or water while in police custody.“My son was at a snack bar having dinner when he was arrested. He was not even protesting,” said a mother whose 18-year-old son had been detained for more than two months.She said her son had been hit so badly during the arrest that “he even lost some of his teeth”. She said he was beaten again in police custody “simply because he refused to sign police papers of his hearings”.View image in fullscreenBus passengers in Casablanca watch security forces detain a man taking part in a protest in September calling for education and health reforms.Photograph: Mosa’ab Elshamy/APFemale protesters were victims of “acts of harassment, insults, and crude and sexist remarks”, said Souad Brahma, president of the Moroccan Association of Human Rights (AMDH). Some also reported incidents of “inappropriate touching”.Three protesters wereshot and killed, allegedly by security forces, at a protest on 1 October in the town of Lqliâa, near the popular Atlantic tourist hotspot of Agadir. A further 14 protesters were injured, including children as young as 12 left with firearm wounds. The authorities claim a group of protesters stormed the local police station, to which officers responded.So far, more than2,400 people are being prosecutedin connection with the protests, and dozens who took part in a non-violent demonstration have been charged with acts of violence, according toAmnesty International.Dozens had already received prison sentences, some of up to 15 years, said AMDH, which denounced the absence of lawyers during hearings, insufficient investigations and the lack of presumption of innocence. It said hundreds more, including children, remained in detention.View image in fullscreenA boy is taken away by riot police at a protest in Salé, near the Moroccan capital, Rabat, on 1 October.

One mother said her son and his friend were beaten so badly with electrical wires on their legs the marks were still visible weeks later. Her son remains in prison.”Elfaz said many protesters and families would not reveal what had happened to them for fear of repercussions. “What happens inside prisons now remains largely hidden,” he said.A lawyer in Casablanca, who has joined a group of about 50 volunteers across the country defending protesters, told the Guardian that there were “multiple procedural violations regarding arrests and police custody”, with severe sentences handed down on insufficient evidence and rushed reports.The Moroccan authorities said allconditions required for a fair trial were respectedfrom the moment of arrest, with police reports drawn up lawfully and verdicts rendered within reasonable timeframes.View image in fullscreenA mourner holds a picture and documents belonging to Abdessamade Oubalat, one of three protesters killed on 1 October in Lqliâa, at his funeral a few days later.Photograph: AFP/GettyLast week, six relatives of two victims killed at the protest in Lqliâa said they were detained by the police after standing outside parliament in the capital, Rabat, holding pictures of their loved ones. The families said the police took their phones and “deleted everything related to the gathering” before later ordering them to leave the city.“We just want justice, a transparent investigation and accountability for those responsible,” said a relative ofone of those killed, Abdessamade Oubalat, a 24-year-old film-maker.The Moroccan authorities said thefamilies were taken to a police stationafter refusing to comply with orders to disperse.

On Thursday, Brazil’s leftist president – who, investigations showed, was the target of anassassination planas part of the coup plot – acknowledged his veto could be overridden by the largely conservative congress.“With all due respect to the congress, when it reaches my desk, I will veto it,” Lula told journalists on Thursday, adding that those who committed crimes against Brazilian democracy “will have to pay for their acts”.“I have the right to veto, and then they have the right to overturn my veto or not. That’s the game.”View image in fullscreenJair Bolsonaro leaving house arrest temporarily in September for a medical appointment.Photograph: Diego Herculano/ReutersLegal experts estimate the bill will reduce Bolsonaro’s time in a closed regime, currently a minimum of six years, to just over two, depending on sentence reduction mechanisms such as good behaviour or reading books.The far-right leader is alreadyserving his sentencein a special cell at the federal police headquarters in Brasília, and his lawyers are seeking supreme court authorisation for him to undergo hernia surgery.Although the legislation falls far short of the full amnesty Bolsonaro and his sons had been demanding, its approval is being celebrated by the former president’s family.“It wasn’t exactly what we wanted … but it’s what was possible,”postedthe senator Flávio Bolsonaro, the former president’s son and, for now, the family’s choice to take on Lula in the 2026 election.The bill reduces time in prison by combining the sentences for two different crimes – such as “attempted coup” and “violent abolition of the democratic rule of law” – but counting only the offence with the higher sentence.View image in fullscreenOpposition senators celebrate the approval of the bill on Wednesday.Photograph: André Borges/EPAIt benefits not only Bolsonaro but all of his aides, including high-ranking military officers who, for thefirst time, were also convicted of attempting a coup in Brazil, as well as hundreds of people who ransacked the capital, Brasília, on 8 January 2023.For that reason, the approval is being seen as a significant setback for those who had widely celebrated the convictions as a sign ofdemocratic progressin Brazil. A recent opinion pollshowedthat most Brazilians opposed reducing the sentences.The journalist and writer Miriam Leitão, a prominent political analyst, described the bill’s passage as the reopening of Brazil’s “historic cycle of impunity”: “2025 was set to go down in history as the year in which Brazil punished coup plotters for the first time, but the bill … threatens to make the country repeat the past,” shewrotein her column for O Globo newspaper.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It helps us compete,” he said. “If we want to boost our economic success significantly, we need to boost immigration.”A year later, however, as public views soured on what had long been a bedrock of Canada’s economic growth toolbox, Trudeau pledged to cut the number of international students coming to the country and made changes to a controversial program that relied on migrant workers for agricultural jobs and the fast-food industry.His immigration minister said the volume of people arriving was “overheated” and pledged to “infuse some discipline” into its handling of the immigration file.13:00Why is anti-immigrant sentiment on the rise in Canada? – videoBy the time Trudeau’s successor, Mark Carney, won a spring election this year, the Liberals, in power for nearly a decade, were midway through dismantling an immigration system they had spent years building up. In November, Carney told students his government was “getting immigration under control”.This week,Canada recorded a rare contraction to its population, marking the biggest drop in more than five decades, and providing evidence that the policy levers Ottawa has frantically pulled are showing real-world consequences. Data from a number of polling firms suggests that the broader public supports more muted immigration goals, but views on immigration are increasingly cleaving along partisan lines.New estimates released on Wednesday by Statistics Canadashowed that Canada’s population fell by 0.2% in the third quarter to stand at 41.6 million, down from 41.65 million on 1 July.The only other quarterly decline on record came in 2020, and was attributed to Covid-19 border restrictions. The recent drop, however, is driven largely by a fall in the number of international students studying in Canada after Ottawa pledged to tamp down the number of study permits issued.Two years ago, facing a labour shortage in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Canada approved large numbers of non-permanent residents, increasing the number of people in the country by 1.3 million. That, the government later concluded, was too much too fast.Since last year, the federal government has used blunt tools to cut the number of people entering Canada, halving the number of study permits issued to international students, cutting the number of migrant workers issued work permits and increasing deportations.“In 2024, the Trudeau government realized they had to switch gears, and they did – but it wasn’t something that could be solved short term. The impact of the policy takes time to come into effect and make a difference. These latest figures from Statistics Canada confirm what should have been expected to see,” said Keith Neuman of the Environics Institute, a non-profit public opinion polling firm. “To me, it seems like a correction as opposed to a decline.”LJ Valencia, an economist with Desjardins Group, suggests the recent decrease in non-permanent residents will have the effect of boosting the country’s real GDP per capita, countering declining growth in 2023 and 2024.“However, weaker population growth is also poised to act as a drag on the broader economy,” he wrote in a research note. “This will add to existing headwinds – from trade policy uncertainty to the mortgage renewal cycle – which are expected to weigh on near-term growth and the minds of central bankers.”But the moves also come as Canada’s public sours on the levels of immigration once cheered on by the government. The country’s shifts in both policy and public sentiment reflect a retreat from aggressive immigration targets.Last year, polling data from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute found Canadians’ concern over immigration has risen fourfold over the last two years. Even the federal government’s own immigration ministry conducted polling that suggested Canadians’ support for immigration levels decreased “to a low not seen in 30 years”.That figure is dramatically higher among Conservative voters.“Federal Conservative party supporters are now, by far, the most critical and negative group of Canadians on [immigration and its effects on the country] and have become measurably more so on almost every measure,” Environicssaid in its recent report.Neuman said that skepticism towards immigration was documented across all party lines, but has levelled off in recent months.“Still, we’re seeing it become far more of a partisan wedge issue than it used to be. The split between parties has been gradually building over the past 15 years, but over the last two years, maybe that gap has really widened,” he said.Neuman also says there has also been a notable shift to how Canadians think about immigration itself. Over nearly four decades, friction over immigration focused on questions of cultural assimilation, he said.With his immigration bill, Canada’s prime minister is bowing to Trump | Tayo BeroRead moreBut the recent cost of living crisis changed that.“Suddenly, for the first time, there was more intense focus and attention on the volume because it coincided with economic affordability concerns. Housing was less affordable. Infrastructure was stretched. In larger cities, people were seeing more and more homeless people and refugees on the streets,” he said. “Public opinion stayed remarkably consistent over the last 15 years through the pandemic and the financial meltdown. None of those really moved the public. But when increased immigration numbers and economic precarity collide, this is when you see the shift.”In November, Carney told a group of university students significant changes were needed to a system that was stretched.“To match immigration levels with our needs and our capacity, the budget will include Canada’s new immigration plan to do better – for newcomers, for everyone.”Data from the federal governmentsshow a spike in resettled refugees accessing homeless shelters in 2023, when the number of people coming to Canada surged.A recent tool from Canada’s immigration and refugees ministry gives users estimated wait times for processing. In a number of cases, those waits reach 10 years.“This is where we are. It’s a challenging one to solve. And so when the prime minister says his government is trying to get this ‘under control’, it reflects issues with the system that are challenging,” said Neuman. “A 10-year wait for a refugee to learn if they can stay in Canada? That doesn’t sound like the system is under control.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasMigrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

The latest strike in the Pacific brings the death toll to 99 since the US began its campaign of striking alleged drug-trafficking boats in September.The announcement comes a day after Donald Trump said he hadinstituted a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankersentering and leaving Venezuela, as he accused Caracas of using oil to fund drug trafficking and other crimes and vowed to escalate the military buildup.What action is Trump taking against Venezuela’s oil industry?Read moreVenezuela, which has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, struck a defiant note on Wednesday, insisting it was proceeding with business as usual, despite the threat of a blockade.“Export operations for crude and byproducts continue normally. Oil tankers linked to PDVSA operations continue to sail with full security,” the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) said.Trump hasoverseen a major military deploymentoff the coast of Venezuela, and the announcement of a blockade will add to pressure on Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, who claims the US seeks regime change instead of its stated goal of stopping drug trafficking.View image in fullscreenVenezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro speaking during an event on Wednesday.Photograph: Wendys Olivo/Venezuelan Presidency/AFP/Getty ImagesMaduro held telephone talks with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to discuss what he called the “escalation of threats” from Washington and their “implications for regional peace”.The foreign minister of China, the main market for Venezuelan oil, defended Caracas in a phone call with his Venezuelan counterpart, Yván Gil. “China opposes all unilateral bullying and supports all countries in defending their sovereignty and national dignity,” he said.On Wednesday, House Republicans rejected a pair of Democratic-backed resolutions which would have forced theTrump administrationto seek authorisation from Congress before continuing attacks against cartels that it deems to be terrorist organisations or launching an attack on Venezuela itself.Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, argued that Trump’s aggressions in the region were really because “the president iscoveting Venezuelan oil.”On Wednesday, Trump cited lost US investments in Venezuela when asked about the blockade, suggesting his administration’s moves were at least somewhat motivated by disputes over oil investments.“You remember they took all of our energy rights. They took all of our oil not that long ago. And we want it back. They took it – they illegally took it.”US oil companies dominated Venezuela’s petroleum industry until the country’s leaders moved to nationalise the sector.The Trump administration has said for months the campaign is about stopping drugs headed to the US, but Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, alsoappeared to confirm in a Vanity Fair interviewpublished on Tuesday that the campaign is part of a push to oust Maduro.The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum,waded into the dispute on Wednesday, declaring that the United Nations was “nowhere to be seen” and asked that it step up to “prevent any bloodshed”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsPete HegsethUS militaryVenezuelaTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

US-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump’s second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China’s increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must unify with the People’s Republic of China.The eight arms sales agreements announced on Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or Himars, and 420 army tactical missile systems, or Atacms – similar to those the US had been sending to Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia – worth more than $4bn. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4bn, as well as drones valued at more than $1bn.Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1bn, Javelin and Tow missiles worth more than $700m, helicopter spare parts worth $96m and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91m.In separate but nearly identical statements, the state department said the sales serve “US national, economic and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.”“The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region,” the statements said.China’s foreign ministry attacked the move, saying it would violate diplomatic agreements between Beijing and Washington, undermine regional stability, and gravely harm China’s sovereignty, security and territorial integrity.“The ‘Taiwan independence’ forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.“This cannot save the doomed fate of ‘Taiwan independence’ but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The US support for ‘Taiwan Independence’ through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed,” he added.Under federal law, the US is obliged to assist Taiwan with its self-defence, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary. Trump has previously suggested Taiwan should pay the US for “protection”.Officials in Washington and Taipei have worked to accelerate the approval for weapon sales to Taiwan since intense Chinese military drills surrounded the island in 2022. But the push towards greater weapons sales has been impeded by Trump’s erratic stance on Taiwan.In a statement on Thursday, Taiwan’s defence ministry expressed gratitude to the US over the arms sale, which it said would help the island maintain “sufficient self-defence capabilities” and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan’s bolstering of its defence “is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,” the ministry said.Taiwan’s foreign minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the US for its “long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defence capabilities,” which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China’s mainland.The arms sales comes as Taiwan’s government haspledged to raise defence spending to 3.3% of the island’s gross domestic productnext year and 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defence, a percentage well above what the US or any of its major allies spend on defence. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan’s opposition KMT party and some of its population.Taiwanese president Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40bn budget for arms purchases, including an air defence system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.But Lai is struggling to get his budget, including the military spending plan, passed in the legislature. Earlier this month opposition lawmakers blocked a bill authorising the defence budget to fund major weapons procurement and joint development programs with the US.Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTaiwanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

She taps her resident card on the reader, the lid swings open, she empties the contents and scans again and a digital screen flashes: 0.5kg.“You have no choice but to pay attention because you can see exactly what you’re wasting,” says Min, who has lived in the complex for 15 years and watched the system arrive in 2020.Her routine is part of thedramatic national shiftthat has taken place over 20 years in South Korea, which recycled 96.8% of its 4.81 million tonnes of food waste in 2023, according to the ministry of climate, energy and environment – a transformation achieved through strict disposal rules, dedicated processing infrastructure and, increasingly, the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) bins that track waste down to the gram.Food waste represents a major global climate challenge. More thana billion tonnes of foodare thrown awayeach year worldwide, generating as much as 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Many countries still send the bulk of it to landfill.South Korea, however, has been grappling with its waste issue for far longer than most countries after its main landfills reached capacity in the early 1990s. The crisis prompted big overhaul of the system and a nationwide pay-as-you-throw scheme in 1995. Residents were required to buy official rubbish bags, which reduced waste but also produced an unexpected issue: once recyclables such as paper were separated out, food scraps were left sitting wet in general waste, worsening odour problems.View image in fullscreenMin Geum-nan uses an RFID bin at her apartment block in SeoulPhotograph: Raphael Rashid/The GuardianThe practice of sending food to landfill was banned altogether in 2005, and mandatory separation imposed. Collection methods varied in the early years, but standardisation accelerated after 2013 when the ocean dumping of leachate – the liquid from food waste processing – was banned, forcing it to be processed on land. Most areas used prepaid yellow bags, which encouraged frugality but created inconveniences: bags filled slowly, especially for small households, and residents disliked storing smelly waste during humid summers.RFID bins, designed to make disposal both more precise and more transparent, were introduced in the early 2010s and are now widespread across cities. The fee – 130 won (about 7p) a kilo in Seoul – is automatically added to monthly maintenance bills.For Min, the system changed behaviour at home. Every household has its own method for squeezing out moisture, she says. “If you don’t remove water, it gets expensive. People press it, drain it and even use strainers. You learn your own tricks.” Being able to dispose of small amounts several times a day also means she no longer worries about smells or flies. “It’s just more convenient,” she says. “I can come here anytime.”Seoul operates 27,289 RFID units, serving 81.6% of apartment residents. Overall coverage across all housing types stands at 37.9%. Nationally, 150,738 units serve 8.54 million apartment households across 186 of the country’s 229 municipalities. The shift has produced measurable results: since citywide implementation began in 2013, Seoul’s food waste has fallen by 23.9% in a decade, from 3,181 tonnes a day to 2,419.Studies of individual complexes show even steeper drops. Research across five Seoul apartment blocks found average reductions of 51% once residents could see – and pay for – the exact weight of what they threw away. In Siheung, a city south of Seoul, officials report a 41% cut across buildings that have adopted the technology.From the bins, the waste – which amounts to about 300 tonnes a day from East Seoul – is taken to the Gangdong district resource circulation centre, where the processing machinery is built underground to minimise odour complaints. Incoming waste is shredded, and foreign materials such as metal fragments or onion mesh bags extracted before the waste moves deeper into the system.View image in fullscreenThe food waste processing facility in Seoul’s Gangdong is located undergroundPhotograph: Raphael Rashid/The GuardianIt is then pressed to extract water, and the separated liquid feeds into anaerobic digesters. The resulting biogas powers the facility’s drying process and odour control systems. The remaining solids – about 10% of the original volume – are dried, screened again for contaminants, and processed into chicken feed that is sold nationwide and even exported. National figures show that around 42% of recycled food waste becomes animal feed, 33% compost and 16% biogas.It has an impact in people’s kitchens too. For many families, Min says, the digital display above the bin has made portion control part of daily life. “If the family leaves food, I make less next time. You start thinking differently.” Cultural norms and regulations reinforce the habit, and community bulletin boards regularly remind residents of sorting rules. “People here are used to doing things properly,” she says.Despite its success, the programme faces several challenges. Central government funding for installation ended in 2014, which means local authorities must finance any new machines themselves. Smaller or poorer municipalities have struggled to keep up, and several have reported delays or slower uptake because ofbudget constraints. Earlier generations of machines have alsosuffered from corrosionfrom the high salt content of Korean food, adding to replacement and maintenance costs.Seoul is trying to push the system further. The cityhas pledgedto cut food waste by 20% by 2030 compared with 2019 levels and to expand the use of RFID bins to 90% of apartment complexes. It also plans to introduce a points-based reward system from 2026, giving households credits they can use towards outgoings such as utility bills if they cut their waste.Countries exploring pay-as-you-throw schemes often struggle with food waste, which is heavier, wetter and more variable than packaging or bottles. South Korea’s model works because it combines several policies – landfill bans, mandatory recycling, precise measurement and dedicated processing plants – built over three decades.For Min, though, the system remains disarmingly simple. “Separating food from other rubbish is just obvious,” she says. “It would be strange not to.”Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesSouth KoreaFood wasteAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

VAT accounts for nearly 40% of China’s total tax revenue.She said no: marriages in China plummet to record lowRead moreAfter imposing a strict one-child policy for more than 30 years, China has over the past decade been introducing a suite of “carrots” to induce people to have more children ina bid to boost the falling birthrate.As well as raising the limit on the number of children permitted per couple to three, provinces have beenexperimentingwith offering discounts on IVF treatment and cash subsidies for extra children. Some local governments offer newlyweds extra days of paid leave to encourage people to tie the knot.But the fact that condoms and contraceptives look set to become more expensive has been met with ridicule on social media. “What is wrong with modern society? They are truly going to extreme lengths just to make us have children,” wrote one user on Weibo.The new VAT law also includes a tax break for childcare and “marriage introduction services”.This year, the government also allocated 90bn yuan ($12.7bn) for its first nationwide childcare subsidy programme, offering 3,600 yuan annually for each child aged under three. And on Saturday it announced plans to expand its national healthcare insurance programme to cover all childbirth related expenses.But incentives have had little effect. In 2024, the birthrate was 6.77 per 1,000 people, a slight increase on 2023, but still far below historical levels. A rising death rate caused by an ageing population meansChina’s population has been shrinkingfor at least three years.Now there are concerns authorities may be turning to “sticks” to achieve the national policy goal of more babies.Women in some areas have reported receiving phone calls from local government officers asking about their menstrual cycles and childbearing plans. In December, Chinese mediareportedthat women in a county in south-west China’s Yunnan province were being required to report the date of their last period to the local authorities. The local health bureau said the data collection was necessary to identify pregnant and expectant mothers.Responding to the news, one social media user wrote: “Today they require all women to report the time of their period, tomorrow it will be reporting the time of sexual intercourse, the day after tomorrow they’ll be calling to urge intercourse during the ovulation period … [this is] mass breeding.”Hiking taxes on condoms is largely a symbolic move. A typical packet of condoms costs 40-60 yuan ($5.70-$8.50). The contraceptive pill, which can be bought over the counter, costs 50-130 yuan per one month packet.“Now that China’s birth policy has shifted to encouraging births and no longer promotes contraception, it is reasonable to resume taxing contraceptives,” said He Yafu, an independent demographer based in Guangdong province. “However, this measure is unlikely to have a significant effect on increasing the fertility rate.”Yun Zhou, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Michigan, said that the new tax was unlikely to affect people’s decision-making, but it signified from the government “what desirable family behaviour should be”. Zhou added that if access to contraception did become difficult, “the brunt of the negative effects will be borne by women, particularly by disadvantaged women.”China’s plan to modernise its tax system includes codifying into law taxes that were previously governed by administrative regulations. But although revenues are badly needed by cash-strapped local governments, some of which have been struggling to actually pay out the childcare subsidies they have promised, the condom tax is unlikely to bring in a significant amount of money.Lee Ding, a manager at Dezan Shira & Associates, an Asia-focused professional services firm, estimates that taxing contraceptives will bring in an additional 5bn yuan annually, a drop in the ocean compared to China’s general public budget revenue of 22tn yuan ($3.1tn). “We do not believe revenue generation is the primary motivation behind extending VAT to contraceptives,” Ding said.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificHealthContraception and family planningnewsShareReuse this content"

Brisbane is expected to hit 33C.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailMost of New South Wales will see broadly dry and sunny conditions on Christmas Day, the BoM says. There will be a few coastal showers moving through areas along the east coast but there won’t be “too much rainfall in them”, generally 5mm or less, BoM senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury said.Weather tracker: Australia bushfires could be most dangerous since ‘black summer’Read moreThere is a chance of a thunderstorm across the north-east of NSW but, at this stage, the BoM does not expect it to become severe.Sydney should see a top temperature of 25C on Christmas Day, and Canberra a top of 29C.Victoria is in for a generally cool to mild day, with a few isolated showers, also with very little rainfall in them. Temperatures are expected to reach the high teens south of the ranges – it’s forecast for a top of 19C in Melbourne – and a bit warmer, from the mid to high 20s, north of the ranges.Tasmania is also in for a cooler day, with scattered showers and the chance of snow on some higher peaks around 1,000m. It will generally only reach the mid-teens in western parts of Tasmania, with Hobart forecast for a top of 17C on Christmas Day.Things change over in the west, with Western Australia in for a very warm Christmas: temperatures in the high 30s to low 40s across western parts of the state and the interior, with Perth in for a top of 39C on Christmas Day.The Northern Territory is expecting warm, humid and cloudy conditions in some parts of the region, with temperatures in the mid-to-high-30s across the central and northern parts, including the top end.Darwin is in for a high of 32C.Christmas celebrations will come on the back ofan extreme and severe heatwavefor much of southern Australia that began on Thursday and is expected to stretch into Sunday. The BoM said NSW’s mid-north coast, the Illawarra, south coast and Snowy Mountains face an extreme heatwave, with some areas set for maximum temperatures in the high 30s to low 40s.An area stretching up the coast from eastern Victoria up to Brisbane will be under a severe heatwave warning through the weekend.“Cooler temperatures are expected to gradually develop from the south with heatwave conditions in these areas expected to peak at the end of this week and then begin to ease later over the weekend,” the BoM said in an advisory note.The NRMA has warned parents that hot temperatures can quickly make parked cars dangerous, with heat inside surging more than 30C above outside readings.“Even on a mild day, the temperature inside a parked car can become dangerous very quickly, placing children at immediate risk of heatstroke, dehydration and, in extreme cases, death,” the organisation said. “Reassuringly, calls to rescue children and pets locked in cars have steadily decreased over the last few years.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherChristmasnewsShareReuse this content"

Russia’s cyber operations form part of a broader influence campaign intended to undermine western support for Ukraine.”It added: “The DDIS assesses that the Danish elections were used as a platform to attract public attention – a pattern that has been observed in several other European elections.”The director of the DDIS, Thomas Ahrenkiel, said they were “very certain that these are pro-Russian groups that have connections to the Russian state”.Denmark’s defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said the attacks were “completely unacceptable” and he was taking the incidents “very seriously”. In an attack on a water utility in Køge in December 2024, a hacker took control of a waterworks and changed the pressure in the pumps, resulting in three burst pipes.“This is very clear evidence that we are now where the hybrid war we have been talking about is unfortunately taking place. It once again puts the spotlight on the situation we find ourselves in in Europe,” Lund Poulsen said.The Danish foreign office would summon the Russian ambassador for a meeting, he said. “It is completely unacceptable that hybrid attacks are carried out in Denmark by the Russian side,.”Britain caught in ‘space between peace and war’, says new head of MI6Read moreAlthough the attacks caused limited damage, the minister for resilience and preparedness, Torsten Schack Pedersen, said they showed that “there are forces capable of closing down important parts of our society”.Denmark, he added, was not sufficiently equipped to withstand such attacks from Russia. “I think you have to be incredibly naive if you think we are at the top of cybersecurity.”Copenhagen described a series of drone incursions on Danish airports and areas of military significance in September as a “hybrid attack”. The incidents, which exposed gaps in its defence capabilities, contributed to plans to establish a European“drone wall”.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkRussiaEuropeCyberwarCybercrimeHackingInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

But we should not be afraid of threats – we should be afraid of Europe being weak.”View image in fullscreenZelenskyy speaking during to EU leaders at the summit.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesEU leaders have been presented with two options to meet Ukraine’s estimated €136bn funding needs in 2026 and 2027: a “reparations loan” secured against Russian frozen assets or joint EU borrowing to fund Kyiv. The European Commission, which proposed the €90bn loan, expects Ukraine’s other western allies to make up the rest.Germany and other frugal countries, such as Sweden and the Netherlands, strongly support tapping Russian assets, rather than European taxpayers. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said the reparations loan was the only option. “We are basically faced with the choice of using European debt or Russian assets for Ukraine, and my opinion is clear: We must use the Russian assets.”What is the row about the EU using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine?Read moreBut Belgium, which hosts most of the Russian assets, said it had not received adequate guarantees from the rest of the EU if the scheme went wrong. “Give me a parachute and we’ll all jump together,” Belgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, told members of the Belgian parliament before the summit began. “If we have confidence in the parachute that shouldn’t be a problem.Belgium has pressed for unlimited guarantees that mean it would not be left alone with the bill should Russia succeed in retaliatory legal claims against Euroclear or Belgian companies.A draft summit text presented on Thursday pledged “full solidarity” and risk-sharing with countries and financial institutions in the context of the reparations loan. But the text seen by the Guardian was scant on details sought by Belgium, such as how quickly guarantees would materialise, or how long they would last.The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, on a visit to Athens, stressed the importance of “mobilising” Russia’s frozen assets, saying it was clear Moscow was still bent on waging its war of aggression in Ukraine.“I see two presidents who are pursuing peace at the moment, President Trump and President Zelenskyy, and one president, President Putin, who is still seeking to escalate conflict and war,” she said. “That is why it is so important to make progress on mobilising the Russian sovereign assets in order to be able to support Ukraine and also to be able to put increased pressure on Russia to properly bring them to the table and pursue peace.”View image in fullscreenYvette Cooper at a press conference in Athens.Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/ReutersRussia’s central bank announced on Thursday that it would pursue damages against European banks “for the illegal blocking and use of its assets”, after its claim for$230bn in damages from Euroclear. Euroclear, the Brussels depository where €185bn Russian assets are parked, has beensubject to an intimidation campaign, security officials told the Guardian.Zelenskyy said he had had “a good conversation” with De Wever during a one-on-one meeting, but that his country faced bigger risks. “One can fear certain legal steps in court from the Russian Federation but it is not as scary as when Russia is at your borders.”In an impassioned speech to EU leaders he urged them to agree the reparations loan on strategic and self-interest grounds. He said much of the funds would be spent on European weapons, while stressing Ukraine also needed some equipment not available in Europe, such as US missile defence systems.Alongside Belgium, Italy, Malta and Bulgaria favour an EU loan, secured against unallocated funds in the EU budget. Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has said using Russia’s assets frozen in Europe to help Ukraine without a solid legal basis would hand Moscow “the first victory since the start of the war”.But common borrowing requires unanimity of the 27 member states. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has slammed using Russia’s frozen assets as a “stupid” idea, while also announcing his veto to joint debt “to finance a war that isn’t our’s”The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he was confident leaders would find a solution. “We are going to find a technical solution, therefore we must not be divided over technical details. Everyone must be listened and heard.”The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she would not leave the summit without a solution. The meeting is scheduled to finish on Friday.The talks are unfolding against a separate diplomatic dance orchestrated by the Trump administration,which is seeking to negotiate a deal to end the war. US and Russian officials are expected to meet in Miami this weekend to discuss Trump’s peace plan, a White House official told AFP on Wednesday.Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner are expected to take part on the US side, while Putin’s economic envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, will represent Russia,Politico reported.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Formerly, the government referred to these neighbourhoods as “ghettoes”.The law states that if these areas also have unfavourable socioeconomic conditions – for example high levels of unemployment or crime – authorities must cut social housing by 40%, including by selling or demolishing properties or terminating the lease of tenants by 2030.In a long-awaited judgment on Thursday on whether the laws targeting these “transformation areas” are racially discriminatory, the European court of justice (ECJ) said the legislation may be unlawful under the EU’s race equality directive.In a preliminary ruling, the ECJ said the law could lead to an increased risk of early lease termination and eviction for residents of these areas compared with those in neighbourhoods with similar socioeconomic conditions but lower levels of immigration.It would be for Danish courts to decide if there was “a difference in treatment based on the ethnic origin of the majority of the inhabitants of those areas, thus resulting in the inhabitants of these areas being treated less favourably”, it said.They would also have to determine whether the law, although worded in a “neutral manner”, actually leads to “persons belonging to certain ethnic groups being placed at a particular disadvantage”, it added.View image in fullscreenLawyer Susheela Math and Muhammad Aslam, head of the tenants’ association of the Mjølnerparken social housing complex.Photograph: Sebastian Elias Uth/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty ImagesThe decision is less emphatic than a previous statement by Tamara Ćapeta, a European court of justice advocate general, whosaid in Februarythat tenants whose leases were terminated “suffer direct discrimination on the basis of the ethnic criterion”.Despite this, lawyers, human rights organisations and residents said the EU decision marked a legal victory for the campaign, which they said they were confident they could win in the domestic courts next year.Residents in the Mjølnerparken housing estate in central Copenhagen had filed a suit against the law in Denmark in 2020, arguing that using their ethnicity to decide where they can live was discriminatory and illegal.Because of the “parallel society” law, more than 1,000 people were forced to move out, and rental costs soared.Muhammad Aslam, chair of the Mjølnerparken residents association, said he was pleased with the ECJ’s decision and he believes his group are now well-placed to win in the high court.Social Democrats in Denmark suffer sweeping election lossesRead moreThe “parallel society” law was “inhumane”, he said. “It threw the families out from our homes when we have done nothing wrong.”For more than a decade, he said, minority communities in Denmark have been subjected to “a competition between politicians and political parties of who can say the worst things against foreigners, refugees, Muslims. Whoever does that gets more seats in parliament.”Aslam, who has lived in Denmark since he was seven and has four children born in Mjølnerparken, who are now successful professionals, said this rhetoric had a big impact on daily life.“We try to say to ourselves we are part of Denmark and part of Danish society,” he said. “But when politicians are talking about us and have these kinds of competitions and trying to move us from society all the time, it affects you and your heart and your mind.”The Danish Institute for Human Rights said the ECJ judgment “provides several grounds” for the law to constitute discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin, but that it did not bring the case to a “definitive close”.Susheela Math, head of legal at Systemic Justice, a Netherlands-based NGO, said the ruling marked “a day of reckoning for the Danish state”, adding that “discrimination is not integration”.“This ghetto package can be really seen as one stage in a long history of political rhetoric and laws and practices that are targeting minorities,” she said.“What today’s judgment makes clear is that the political rhetoric and legislative context problematising and stereotyping those of ‘non-western background’ can be taken into account in terms of whether this amounts to racial discrimination.”The Danish ministry of social affairs and housing said the case would now return to Denmark’s eastern high court, and that the ministry would read the European court’s verdict carefully.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkRaceEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It honours a body of work rather than a particular performance.The Irish actor has received critical plaudits and nominations for film and TV performances, and has won Irish film and television awards and a Berlin international film festival award, but had not landed a major Hollywood prize.View image in fullscreenDomhnall Gleeson as Bill Weasley with Mark Williams and Clemence Poesy in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy“I first saw Domhnall in 2006 when he played the role of Davey in Martin McDonagh’s play The Lieutenant of Inishmore,” said Trina Vargo, the founder and president of the US-Ireland Alliance. “His talent was obvious 20 years ago, it’s been a pleasure to watch him go from strength to strength, and we look forward to honouring him.”The US-Ireland Alliance is a nonprofit that fosters ties between the countries and is credited with hosting one of theliveliest partiesof Hollywood’s award season. Previous award recipients include Jamie Dornan, Kenneth Branagh and Kerry Condon.Next year’s ceremony will also honour Maura Tierney, who starred in Twisters and is best known for the TV series ER.Gleeson made his name on indies and blockbuster film franchises such as Harry Potter and Star Wars and is a proliferating presence on TV shows.He plays the editor of a struggling Ohio newspaper inThe Paper, a spin-off from the US version of The Office which follows the mockumentary format. He stars opposite Jessie Buckley in the forthcoming BBC Christmas special, The Scarecrows’ Wedding and did voiceovers for Ken Burns’ documentary The American Revolution.View image in fullscreenRachel McAdams with Gleeson in About Time, 2013.Photograph: Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarHe has also appeared in two Apple TV productions, Guy Ritchie’sFountain of Youth, with John Krasinski and Natalie Portman, and Echo Valley, with Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney.AnEsquire profilelast month said Gleeson’s performances have earned praise “even as he has somehow remained critically underrated”. The article was headlined: “Why isn’t everyone talking about Domhnall Gleeson?”The Dubliner was nominated for a Tony for The Lieutenant of Inishmore in 2006 and for a Golden Globe in 2023 for The Patient, in which he plays a serial killer opposite Steve Carell, but has missed out on Emmy and Oscar nominations.The son ofBrendan Gleeson, his filmography includes Ex Machina, Anna Karenina, True Grit, Brooklyn, Calvary, The Revenant andAbout Time, a time-travelling romcom. He played General Hux in the Star Wars reboot and Bill Weasley in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.“When he’s performing his appearance is almost fluid, absorbing the contours of his characters’ expressions so thoroughly that he sometimes appears reconfigured,” said Esquire. It noted his “alabaster skin and burnt-sienna eyebrows” – a more lyrical description than the Guardian, which called Gleeson a“ginger Hugh Grant”.Explore more on these topicsFilmIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Beyond its visual appeal, the red soil – known locally as gelak – is exported in limited quantities and used in the production of cosmetics, pigments and some traditional products.Hormuz Islandlies in the strait of Hormuz, where the Persian Gulf meets the Gulf of Oman, about 670 miles (1,080km) south of Iran’s capital, Tehran. Rainfall is relatively rare on the island, and happens mainly during the winter and early spring.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north Africanews"

Well-paid troops, mainly drawn from a Saudi-funded militia called the National Shield, have been gathering in the al-Wadeeah and al-Abr areas close to the Saudi border.The STC has been reassured it retains the support of the UAE, raising the prospect of future clashes between troops loyal either toSaudi Arabiaor the UAE.mapThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, predicted a full-scale resumption of fighting in Yemen could have consequences across the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Horn of Africa. He urged all parties in Yemen, including external actors that “unilateral actions will not clear a path to peace, but only deepen divisions, raise the risk of wider escalation and cause further fragmentation”.“The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yemen must be preserved,” he said on Wednesday, adding that nearly 5 million Yemenis had been forced to flee their homes owing to a lengthy civil war between the Houthis in the north and the now badly fracturing forces in the south.The STC, in talks in the stronghold of Aden last Friday, said it would not obey a Saudi demand to withdraw its forces, which first entered Hadramaut a fortnight ago and then moved into the neighbouring governorate of al-Mahra, bordering Oman. It has also tightened its grip by sending troops into a third governorate, Abyan.View image in fullscreenMembers of the forces of the Southern Transitional Council in the southern Abyan province.Photograph: ReutersThesudden and unexpected STC advancestunned Riyadh, which had previously been the dominant player in Yemen. The UK, along with most of the international community, favours retaining Yemen as one country, but this requires the Houthis that dominate in the north coming to an agreement to share power with the south in a federal government. The STC is proposing that an independent south could become an anti-extremist bulwark protecting the Red Sea shipping lanes from Houthi and al-Qaida terrorism. The STC’s difficulty is that by no means all southern groups want Yemen to divide, but it will have to see if it can form a coherent government.Farea al-Muslimi, a research fellow on the Middle East programme at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “So far Saudi Arabia has tried strategic patience, but I do not think that will last. It does not mean it will necessarily go into a direct war with the UAE in Yemen. But Yemen is a poor country with too many young fighters and too many proxies. Both sides are putting all their cards on the table.“While much of what that has happened is not surprising for Yemen observers, the optics is too humiliating for Saudi Arabia. This is playing out on its borders, not those of the UAE.”With the capture of the two governorates, the STC can claim it controls all the land that made up the old southern state of Yemen. Hadramaut spans 36% of Yemen’s territory, possesses the country’s largest oil reserves and includes key ports such as Mukalla, al-Shihr and the oil terminal at al-Dhabba.The leadership of the Islah party, the largest political party in Yemen and which is opposed to secession by the South, told the Guardian it believed the calls from within Hadramaut for the STC to withdraw may soon become overwhelming.On a visit to London, Islah’s acting secretary general, Abdulrazak al-Hijri, said: “We hope this can be resolved peacefully, but what happened in Hadramaut is a dangerous development and negatively impacts on the legitimate state institutions. Irregular forces not under state control have invaded stable and secure governorates throwing everything into chaos”. He said Hadramaut had a long history of independence and all the major political and tribal leaders in the governorate wanted the STC to leave.He added widespread reports were circulating of STC human rights abuses, including theft of property and mass arrests. “Saudi Arabia is determined that these forces must leave and return to their own places. The legitimate government is being fragmented and the only beneficiary of these intensified divisions will be the Houthis,” he added.Hijri claimed the Houthis “do not see Yemenis as a people, but rather see them as a group of slaves over whom they are the masters”.Islah says it is a civilian party and has no connection with the Muslim Brotherhood, contrary to UAE claims. Since 2022 the STC had been uneasily sharing power on a Saudi-organised presidential leadership council with a variety of other groups, including the Islah party.Explore more on these topicsYemenSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He had entered hospice on Saturday while suffering from prostate cancer.As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war’s end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN of the first Gulf war.While almost all western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the US-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.“There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,” he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.“I think that took out the telecommunications center,” he said of another explosion. “They are hitting the center of the city.”It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.In January 1966 he joined a battalion of US soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when the soldier paused to read a map.“As the colonel peered at it I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,” Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. “He sank to the ground at my feet.”He would begin the fallen soldier’s obituary like this: “He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel’s leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.”Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining the Associated Press as its Indonesia correspondent.That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia’s economy was in shambles and the country’s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies he would find himself in, while also forging an historic career.At the AP’s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer prizes.He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: never stand near a medic or radio operator because they are among the first the enemy will shoot at and, if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don’t look around to see who fired it because the next one will probably hit you.He would stay in Vietnam until the capital of Saigon fell to the communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975 and in the time leading up to those final days he was ordered by AP’s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau’s papers as coverage of the war wound down.Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they would have historic value someday. They are now in the AP’s archives.After the war’s end Arnett remained with the AP until 1981, when he joined the newly formed CNN.Ten years later he was in Baghdad covering another war. He not only reported on the frontline fighting but won exclusive, and controversial, interviews with the then president, Saddam Hussein, and future September 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.In 1995 he published the memoir, Live From the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World’s War Zones.Arnett resigned from CNN in 1999, months after the network retracted an investigative report he did not prepare but narrated alleging that deadly Sarin nerve gas had been used on deserting US soldiers in Laos in 1970.He was covering the second Gulf war for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the US military’s war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.After his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.In 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China’s Shantou University.Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.Born 13 November, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.“I didn’t really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a – you know – enormously delicious feeling that I’d found my place,” he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.After a few years at the Times he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.Soon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.Arnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.Explore more on these topicsUS newsVietnam warIraqMiddle East and north AfricaNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

TheElectoral Commission, which had been asked to open a separate inquiry into other elements, said it had not identified any undeclared spending that should have been reported.“We have assessed a report relating to an allegation around misreported expenditure by a political candidate in connection with the general election in July 2024,” Essex police said.It said the report had been made on 5 December. “Having regard to the Representation of the People Act 1983, which states any prosecution for such an offence must commence within one year, it has been concluded that this report falls outside of the stated statutory time limit, and no investigation can take place.”The Electoral Commission said: “We have responded to Anna Turley MP’s correspondence, which raised questions about Reform UK’s spending at the 2024 general election. After carefully considering the information presented in the letter, we did not identify any expenditure relating to Mr Farage’s election campaign in Clacton that should have been declared in Reform UK’s national expenditure.”On Wednesday, Turley, the Labour party chair, had called on Farage to “urgently come out of hiding” and explain whether his party had spent more than the £20,660 limit for campaigning, in a letter to the Electoral Commission.“If expenditure that ought to have been declared in Mr Farage’s return in Clacton has been included in Reform’s national spending return, or elements of national party expenditure have not been declared at all, there is a real risk that Reform’s party spending return is inaccurate or incomplete, which is a matter for the Electoral Commission,” Turley wrote.That followed the news that a whistleblower had told the Daily Telegraph Reform had failed to declare spending on leaflets, banners, utility bills and refurbishment of a bar in its Clacton campaign office.Sam Power, an academic at the University of Bristol and an expert in political financing, said the police, not the Electoral Commission, had the power to investigate the main allegation against Farage.“The commission have purview over party spending, not campaign spending. So they would have to be misreporting in these returns. Turley asked them to look at whether party spending had not been declared, and [whether] Clacton spending had been reported as national spending. Given that the main allegations related to potential campaign overspend – a matter for the police – [Turley’s request] was a bit of a square peg in a round hole.”A Reform spokesperson previously denied the allegations, saying: “The party denies breaking electoral law. We look forward to clearing our name.”Farage has been facing multiple troubles – chief among themallegations of overt racism during his schooldays, as well as by party colleagues more recently.On Wednesday,26 of his peers at Dulwich collegecondemned him for what they described as his refusal to acknowledge his behaviour at Dulwich college and criticised him for saying their allegations about his past behaviour were politically motivated.Reform described the allegations as a “witch-hunt” and “an attempt to discredit Reform and Nigel Farage”. “Instead of debating Reform on the substance of our ideas and policies, the leftwing media and deeply unpopular Labour party are now using 50-year-old smears in a last act of desperation. The British public see right through it,” a spokesperson said.Farage has also been urged to sack one of his party’s mayoral candidates after it emerged he said the deputy prime minister, David Lammy, should “go home” to the Caribbean. Lammy is British.Reform UK has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKElectoral CommissionGeneral election 2024RacenewsShareReuse this content"

It is not meant to break bodies or silence dissent.“Yet we are witnessing conditions so severe that these young people feel driven to risk death simply to be heard.”Campbell said the allegation “couldn’t be further from the truth”.Dr James Smith, a qualified emergency physician who is a lecturer at University College London, told a press conference on Thursday that some of the prisoners on hunger strikes were dying.A group of 51 MPs and peers wrote to the justice secretary, David Lammy, urging him to meet the lawyers of the eight prisoners.Jeremy Corbyn, the independent MP and former Labour leader, told the Commons the group had not been given a “substantive reply from the Ministry of Justice”.He said: “I would hope that in hearing this debate, they will recognise they have a responsibility for the welfare, the medical condition and the way in which prisoners are supported in every one of our prisons, that includes people who are taking protest action.”Campbell said: “The welfare and the wellbeing of prisoners, whether they’re on hunger strike or not, are absolutely central to the prison service and to ministers’ minds. And it is really important that we appreciate that the deputy prime minister does take a keen interest in what is happening and hope that we can find a suitable outcome for this.“And I also have to say very gently, it couldn’t be further from the truth for anyone in this House or indeed outside to suggest that somehow the government or the prison service is trying to ‘break the bodies’ of the people that are on hunger strike.“We want to find a settlement to this and I give a commitment to take back to the deputy prime minister what has been said here today and hopefully we can find a suitable way forward.”The prisons minister, Lord Timpson, said: “We are very experienced at dealing with hunger strikes. Unfortunately, over the last five years we have averaged over 200 hunger strike incidents every year and the processes that we have are well-established and they work very well – with prisons working alongside our NHS partners every day, making sure our systems are robust and working – and they are.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The latter closed a few months later, but Napier, accommodating about 400 people, weathered multiple storms. Approximately 200 men, half of those accommodated on the site at the time, were infected in amass Covid outbreak. Then there were far-right protests, fires, hunger strikes and adamning high court rulingthat found it failed to meet minimum standards. At one point Kent county council was so concerned about conditions for the men accommodated there it launched a safeguarding inquiry.Initially, asylum seekers were accommodated there for an indefinite period but theHome Officesubsequently introduced a 90-day limit, which the men held there said made their time there more bearable.Sally Hough, who ran the Napier drop-in centre, which provided advice and support for asylum seekers at Napier, said: “The closure of the camp is a day of very mixed emotions for everyone who has been involved in supporting the residents. For all of us, it has been completely life-changing in a positive way. However, the camp itself, the buildings, the shambolic management, have left their mark on those that stayed there.”She said things were particularly chaotic in the early months with no drinking water and furniture salvaged from old stable blocks. The men slept in dormitories and some slept outside the barracks in sub-zero temperatures due to fears of becoming infected with Covid if they slept inside close to others. After the high court ruling there was a brief emptying of the barracks while the walls were repainted. But it reopened within days.“Folkestone is a special place and the fact that former residents return to visit us from far flung places of the UK is testament to that. It became a vital safe space for the men to go outside of the camp, seek advice and see a friendly face in the community,” Hough said. “Just the other day some of the men were volunteering with clearing and controlled burning of scrubland so that the flowers will come back in spring. What a wonderful thing to leave behind for the community.”Charlotte Khan, the head of advocacy and public affairs at the charity Care4Calais, said: “We’ve supported people at Napier barracks since it opened and we can’t shy away from the trauma it has inflicted upon many, particularly in its early days.“Our volunteers have done an incredible job supporting the people in the barracks, but we are pleased to see it closing. Frankly, former military sites are not suitable accommodation for refugees who have fled war, torture and persecution. They are retraumatising, and harm people’s health and wellbeing.“People want, and should, be accommodated in communities, not camps. That should be the final lesson the government takes from Napier.”AHome Officespokesperson said: “We are furious at the level of illegal migrants and asylum hotels. This government will close every asylum hotel. Work is well under way, with more suitable sites being brought forward to ease pressure on communities and cut asylum costs. We are working closely with local authorities, property partners and across government so that we can accelerate delivery.”The site will be handed back to the Ministry of Defence by the Home Office in January 2026 and will be redeveloped by Taylor Wimpey as houses and flats.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumKentHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

The number of people seeking treatment is rising significantly and on average patients are already waiting five years and seven months for a first assessment.The review conducted by Dr David Levy, an NHS medical director and cancer specialist, was commissioned after last year’s Cass report on gender care for children and young people.Levy, an NHS medical director and cancer specialist, took a team to nine NHS England clinics to assess the effectiveness and safety of each service, interviewing staff and patients.His report found that the clinics’ failure to study outcomes for their patients made it impossible to judge the safety of these services.“It is unacceptable that there is no outcomes data to support or guide patients, clinicians and commissioners in understanding which treatments and interventions may deliver the best outcomes for patients,” the review said.Long waiting lists were also leading to safety issues, driving people to self-source hormone drugs from high-risk online providers abroad. By the time patients were seen by clinicians, staff said it was often challenging to provide appropriate support because in the interim patients had sought information and support online, some of which may have been inaccurate, the report noted.Aside from the detailed information about waiting times there was “virtually no other data” available from the adult clinics, Levy wrote, making it impossible to analyse how patients responded to a range of treatments, from prescription of cross-sex hormones to psychological support. The adult clinics can refer patients for surgical interventions, but this is provided by a separate NHS service, which was not reviewed by the team.The review heard that some patients expressed regret and dissatisfaction after treatment, and a smaller number later chose to reverse their gender transition, but it was impossible to estimate what proportion later detransitioned because of the absence of outcomes data.“These services need robust, high-quality research. While the review heard that some GDCs were involved in national or international research projects, little evidence was shared before or during the review visits,” the report found. Clinicians told the review team that it was challenging to undertake clinical audits on a population “that may feel vulnerable and mistrustful about how data is held and used”.In her report of last year,Dr Hilary Cass notedthat she had been approached by a number of staff members working in adult clinics who were concerned by “out of control” waiting lists and inconsistent standards in the services.The profile of people seeking help has changed significantly, shifting from a predominantly older to a predominantly younger age group of patients; the majority (57%) of referrals are now for those aged between 18 and 25 years old. The population has also shifted from mostly birth-registered males to a more even ratio of birth-registered females, but getting precise data was difficult because not all clinics recorded sex at birth, using patient-reported gender instead, the report noted.The review was told that the growing younger cohort of patients had a higher proportion of additional neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder, and a broader range of other issues, such as mental health conditions, trauma or abuse during childhood, compared with patients referred in the past.Only 31.5% of patients were discharged having completed their treatment, raising questions about why patients were not continuing to attend or could not be contacted, the review team found. “This should be an early priority for a national audit,” the report said.“Gender service provision is an area where there are strongly held views about how care should be delivered and who should provide it. These services have to navigate this challenging landscape, where debate is often hostile and polarised, while continuing to provide patient care,” the report noted.The review team heard from some staff members that they were not encouraged to raise concerns in team meetings, and “felt clinical curiosity or constructive challenge was discouraged” and that “issues raised were dismissed as transphobia or prejudice”. This atmosphere was not felt in all clinics, the review found, with some workplaces encouraging staff contributions.Prof James Palmer, national medical director for specialised services, said: “Too many people are waiting far too long to get care, experiences of care are variable, and we need to ensure care is equitable wherever patients live. We have already begun to take action to improve adult gender services by increasing investment and opening more clinics to help bring down long waits but we will use the recommendations in this report to further improve services across the NHS.” The funding available for non-surgical gender care more than doubled from £16m in 2020-21 to £36m in 2024-25Levy made 20 recommendations, including a requirement that clinics nationally begin reporting outcomes data that include patients’ birth-registered sex. From January he will chair a new national improvement programme for adult gender services.The campaign group TransActual welcomed recommendations “for a more streamlined, patient centred care pathway”, but raised concerns about the proposed ending of self-referrals and said requiring a first assessment to be done by a senior clinician risked “unnecessarily hampering efforts to reduce waiting times”.Explore more on these topicsNHSTransgenderGenderYoung peopleEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Among them are photographs of what appear to be lines from Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita written on different parts of a woman’s body.The release maintains pressure on Donald Trump, whose justice department hasless than 48 hoursto comply with theEpstein Files Transparency Act, a congressional billsigned into lawlast month, requiring the Department of Justice to release its files, withsome exceptions, related to Epstein.Over the summer, the Trump administration drew backlash when the justice department saidit would not releaseany additional Epstein files -despite earlier promisesfrom Trump and his allies on the campaign trail.Trump had, for months, opposed the congressional bill requiring the release of the justice department’s Epstein files, butreversed coursewhen it became evident that it had enough bipartisan support to pass. He signed the bill into law on 19 November.One image in the release on Thursdayshows text written on a woman’s chest, that reads: “Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth.”The second image shows a passage written on a woman’s foot: “She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock.”Additional images show the line “She was Lola in slacks” written on a woman’s body, and the passage “She was Dolly at school” on a woman’s neck. The final image shows the line “She was Dolores on the dotted line” written on a woman’s spine.View image in fullscreenThis undated and unlocated handout image shows Jeffrey Epstein speaking to Noam Chomsky.Photograph: House Oversight Democrats/AFP/Getty ImagesThe release also includes photographs of Bill Gates posing with a woman whose face has been redacted, and of the prominent linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky sitting on a plane with Epstein. It has been previously reported thatGatesandChomskyknew Epstein. Gates has previously said that he made a“huge mistake”in meeting with Epstein.Other images show Woody Allen, the director; Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser; and David Brooks, the author and New York Times opinion columnist, among others. In November of this year, Brookswrote a columnheadlined “The Epstein Story? Count Me Out”.Again, no context for these photographs has been provided, and the appearance of these people in the photos is not evidence of wrongdoing.In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for the New York Times said that “as a journalist, David Brooks regularly attends events to speak with noted and important business leaders to inform his columns, which is exactly what happened at this 2011 event. Mr Brooks had no contact with him before or after this single attendance at a widely-attended dinner.”The batch also includes photos of a number of foreign passports, with the information redacted, as well as Epstein’s US passport.There is also a screenshot of a text message conversation from a unknown sender referring to an 18-year-old from Russia. The sender says “I have a friend scout she sent me some girls today” then sends “But she asks 1000$ per girl” and following messages that read “I will send u girls now”, and “Maybe someone will be good for J?”.View image in fullscreenA photo of the New York Times columnist David Brooks, released on Thursday.Photograph: House Oversight DemocratsIn a statement after the release, Robert Garcia, a US representative and ranking member of the committee on oversight and government reform, said: “OversightDemocratswill continue to release photographs and documents from the Epstein estate to provide transparency for the American people.”“As we approach the deadline for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, these new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession,” he said.“We must end this White House cover-up, and the DoJ must release the Epstein files now.”With less than 48 hours to go, reports haveemergedof frustration growing within the justice department as it races to redact thousands of pages from the files.According to a source who spoke to CNN, each attorney in the department’s national security division has been processing more than 1,000 documents since Thanksgiving week.Moreover, with only four pages given to lawyers as internal guidance on redactions, sources told the outlet that lawyers feel they have not received clear or comprehensive guidance on how to publicly disclose much of the information under the law.Legal experts expect problems with the justice department’s document release, warning that the fast review of a massive trove could lead to over-redaction or errors, including the exposure of sensitive personal information.The new photos came after Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime associate, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence forsex-trafficking crimes, asked a federal court to “vacate, set aside, or correct her conviction and sentence”.Thehabeas petition, filed on Wednesday by Maxwell, claims “substantial new evidence” had emerged from civil actions, government disclosures, investigative reports and other documents that she says support her claim that she did not receive a fair trial.“This newly available evidence – derived from litigation against the Federal Bureau of Investigation, various financial institutions, and the Estate ofJeffrey Epstein, as well as from sworn depositions, released records, and other verified sources – shows that exculpatory information was withheld, false testimony presented, and material facts misrepresented to the jury and the court,” Maxwell wrote in the petition, which she filed “pro se”, meaning without an attorney.The filing marks Maxwell’s latest bid for freedom, following severalunsuccessfulappealattemptssince she wasconvictedof sex trafficking in 2021 and sentenced to 20 years behind bars. Epsteindiedin federal custody in 2019, while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.Earlier this month, a federal judgeruledthat the justice department could release grand jury materials from Maxwell’s case, citing the new law passed by Congress.An attorney for Maxwell had argued, according to theNew York Times, that disclosing those materials publicly would “create undue prejudice so severe that it would foreclose the possibility of a fair retrial” if her request for a new trial were granted.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsBill GatesNoam ChomskyDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.”The name change is the culmination of an aggressive effort by the Trump administration to remake the US capital’s arts and culture institutions more to its liking. The Kennedy Center confirmed the vote to change the namein an email to the Washington Post.Joe Kennedy III, grandnephew of the former president who also served a congressman for Massachusetts, said he doubted the center’s name could legally be changed.“The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law. It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,Kennedy III posted to X.Earlier this year, House Republicans proposed changing the name of the Kennedy Center’s Opera House to the “First Lady Melania Trump Opera House”. It has also ordered a review of the Smithsonian Institution and is seeking to build a huge ballroom adjacent to the White House. That ballroom takes the place of the East Wing, which was demolished over the summer.Kennedy Center ticket sales fall to lowest in years after Trump’s takeoverRead moreCritics of the Kennedy Center name changes have pointed to afederal statuteestablishing the center that says “the Board shall assure that after December 2, 1983, no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.”Trump installed himself as chair of the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees in February, calling it a “take-over” after purging the board.“Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth — THIS WILL STOP. The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation,” Trump said, adding in capitals, “the best is yet to come.”Earlier this month, the center honored a hand-selected list of contributors to the nation’s cultural output. Trump served as the evening’s compere. They included the country singer George Strait; Broadway actor Michael Crawford, best known for The Phantom of the Opera; actor Sylvester Stallone; and disco singer Gloria Gaynor.When he announced the honorees in August, Trump said he was “very involved” in selecting the group. Past recipients of the center’s lifetime achievement awards include Stephen Sondheim, Yo-Yo Ma, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Johnny Cash, Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, LL Cool J, Francis Ford Coppola and the Grateful Dead.The US congresswoman Joyce Beattyposted on Xthat the decision to rename the institution as the Trump-Kennedy Center was not unanimous. Beatty serves as an ex-officio member of the center.“For the record. This was not unanimous,” she said. “I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move.” Beatty called the center’s renaming a “just another attempt to evade the law and not have the people have a say”.This article was amended on 18 December 2025. An earlier version referred to Joe Kennedy III as JFK’s grandson rather than his grandnephew.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Nobody deserves it more than our military.”“We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs, and the bill helped us along,” he added.In reality, the payments will be funded by repurposing military housing assistance – approved by Congress as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act – the Washington Postreportedon Thursday, citing an unnamed senior administration official.The pledge to issue a so-called “warrior dividend” – a policy worth about $2.5bn, which he suggested was finalized “about 30 minutes” before his address – had raised immediate questions, particularly ahead of ahighly anticipated decision by the supreme courtthat could force the administration to return billions of dollars the US has raised from steep tariffs on foreign goods.“Would it be a complete mess?” Justice Amy Coney Barrettasked about prospective tariff reimbursementduring oral arguments in November. “It seems to me like it could be a mess.”On Trump’s watch the overall average US effective tariff rate has surged to 16.8%, its highest level since 1935,accordingto The Budget Lab at Yale, with an average hit to households of about $1,700.Details also remained unclear about precisely who qualifies to receive the dividend, when it will be issued, its taxable status and its effect on military pay and benefits.The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth,said in a video postedon Thursday that the payment would “provide 1776 with a whole new modern meaning for our joint force”, adding that the payment would be tax-free and issued to more than 1.45 million service members “in the coming days”.“This has never happened before, every member of our military, from E-1 to O-6,” Hegseth said, referring to military pay grades from private, airman basic and seaman recruit to the senior officers in the ranks of colonel, captain and commander.The announcement comes as Operation Southern Spear is amassing forces in the Caribbean in what was initially described as an anti-narcotics operation against Venezuela’s Maduro regime, and as US forces suffered three casualties during an Isis attack in Syria.But despite Trump saying the payment will go out to “every soldier”, it remains unclear if national guard and reserve members meet active-duty criteria. “Under federal law, most bonuses and special pay are treated as taxable income unless Congress specifies otherwise”,Military.com advised,pointing out that no tax exemption had been announced.TheTrump administrationhas repeatedly floated sending out stimulus checks to all Americans below an unspecified income level, funded by tariffs, amid controversy over the impact of Trump’s economic policy on prices and affordability.The first Trump administration sent out two rounds of stimulus checks to US households during the early days of the Covid pandemic. The Biden administration also sent one. In total,more than 476m payments totaling $814bn in financial reliefwere sent to Americans in 2020 and 2021.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryTariffsUS economyEconomicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The companies expect this to take place in mid-2026.Trump Media announces plans to expand into cryptoRead moreTAE, backed by Alphabet’s Google and Chevron, the oil giant, is aiming to develop and sell next-generation neutral beam systems for fusion and related applications in a more cost-effective manner.Nuclear fusion refers to a nascent technology that aims to generate electricity by harnessing the process that powers the sun. It offers the vision of abundant energy without pollution, radioactive waste or greenhouse gases.TMTG, meanwhile, has struggled to capitalize on its ownership of Trump’s Truth Social platform, which the president regularly updates with musings, announcements and attacks.The firm reported sales of $927,900 for the three months to 30 September, down from just over $1.01m the previous year. Its losses also widened to $54.8m, from $19.2m in the same quarter of 2024.Devin Nunes, chairman and CEO of TMTG, made the case for its planned combination of social media and fusion power.“Trump Media & Technology Group built uncancellable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans, and now we’re taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America’s global energy dominance for generations,” Nunes said in a statement. “Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s – an innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America’s A.I.-supremacy, revive our manufacturing base and bolster national defense.”TMTG “brings the capital and public market access to quickly move TAE’s proven technology to commercial viability”, he added.The tech industry’s insatiable demand for electricity needed to run datacenters that power artificial intelligence technologies has renewed interest in nuclear power supply, including restarting fully shut reactors, expanding capacity and contracting for power from future small modular reactors.The rising demand is also propelling the development of nuclear power plants, which is widely deemed to be a cleaner source of energy.Nunes will serve as co-CEO of the new company, along with TAE’s CEO and director, Michl Binderbauer, the companies said, adding the deal was approved by the boards.Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush, said Trump Media would probably be “now all about TAE”, despite the deal technically being a 50:50 merger between the two firms. “TAE will also clearly have major political support from President Trump in our view and this importantly will create a major nuclear fusion US energy domestic bet over the coming years,” added Ives.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsMediaSocial mediaArtificial intelligence (AI)Energy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The 1.4 gigawatt center would consume as much power as Detroit, and would help derail Michigan’s nation-leading transition to renewable energy.Responding to resident pressure, Saline Township’s board of trustees in September voted down the plans, but the data center’s powerful backers – including Donald Trump, Open AI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, utility giant DTE Energy, and Stephen Ross, the real-estate billionaire and Trump donor who owns Related Co – fought back.View image in fullscreenA fallen sign on the curb near the site of the soon-to-be-built data center.Related Digital sued, and, vastly outgunned, the township board quickly folded and reversed its decision over strong resident objections. Now the project’s backers are trying to avoid minimal regulatory scrutiny on energy costs and pollution.The controversy over the data center is representative of the David v Goliath fightsplayingout across the US,pittingworking- and middle-class residents against the interests of billionaires and the political establishment.“This is part of an experience that America and the world is having around tech billionaires who are seizing power and widening the gap between those have much too much … and the working and middle classes,” said Yousef Rabhi, a former Democratic state legislative leader and clean energy advocate who opposes the plans.“That’s what these data centers are symbolic of, and they’re the vehicle for is the furtherance of this divide,” Rabhi added.View image in fullscreenYousef Rabhi speaks at a rally held in Saline Township in opposition to the data center.Photograph: Courtesy of Yousef RabhiThe proposal is part of the broader “Stargate” project composed of five data centersbacked by the Trump administration, whichgranted $500bn in federal subsidiesfor them. It’s the largest project in Michigan history in terms of investment, and it also received subsidies on taxes that could have gone to roads and schools, among other uses, Rabhi said.The plan’s supporters say the center would provide essential AI infrastructure, in part for national security, and create a few hundred jobs. Huge sums of money are at stake for the tech and utility companies.Ross’s Related Digital is the data center’s developer, while OpenAI, which produced ChatGPT, and Oracle will use the center to house its AI infrastructure.In a statement, Related Digital alleged company the township’s decision violated zoning laws, and the spokesperson stressed the suit was filed jointly with three Saline Township property owners who are selling their property to Related.“Thankfully, we were able to reach a settlement agreement with the township to allow this project to move forward,” the spokesperson said. They noted Related is also making about $14m in donations to local causes.Saline Township is a small community of about 4,000 just outside Ann Arbor. The Stargate project is one of around a dozen data center proposals in Michigan over the last year that are strongly opposed at the local level. It’s one of four proposed near Ann Arbor – last week, plans for a second a few miles away in a neighboring town surfaced.Some municipalities have been successful in derailing plans, while others have lost the fight.View image in fullscreenA new data center being built along US Route 12 in Saline Township.Photograph: Sarah Rice/The GuardianIn Saline Township, former US marine Kate Haushalter and her husband are raising five children in a farmhouse next to the data center site. They bought and renovated the once-dilapidated home so they could live in a bucolic area, and Haushalter said she was not about to cede ground even though the township did.“Maybe because I was in the Marine Corps, but I would rather stay and fight,” Haushalter said. “I’m sure the chances are slim, but it’s worth fighting for, and I don’t want to teach my kids to roll over.”‘We were dealt the cards we were dealt’Big tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Open AI, which often own data centers, typically have enough political support at the state and federal levels that inexperienced local leaders who are comparatively poorly resourced are left on their own to defend their town from the centers.Saline Township supervisor Jim Marion conveyed that challenge when he told angry residents during a contentious November discussion that the township’s “hands were tied”.“This township doesn’t have the money to fight these big companies. You got to understand that,” Marion told the crowd. “We were dealt the cards we were dealt.”View image in fullscreenA sign warns of ‘construction ahead’ on US Route 12.Photograph: Sarah Rice/The GuardianSome municipalities have utilized zoning laws to block the centers. Beyond that, there’s little local officials can do, and state and federal level regulations on the centers are virtually non-existent.Still, residents are growing more organized. A first protest on 1 December drew about 200 people, who Rabhi described as “truly a cross-section of American society”. The next week, 800 people participated in a state-level public input session, and organizers are pressuring state environmental regulators to hold up the project’s required wetland permits.Among residents leading the pushback is Josh LeBaron, whose home sits about 500 yards from the site, where crews have broken down.He characterized the project as “uniquely evil” because of the environmental risks, and because, he and others allege, the companies and government have been secretive about their plans. In response to questions about accusations of nimby-ism leveled against local residents by the project’s supporters, LeBaron said he would not be opposed to other developments.View image in fullscreenA sign protesting against the new data center in Saline Township.Photograph: Sarah Rice/The GuardianHe noted that Michigan is full of former industrial sites that would be more appropriate for the 575-acre property.“I would be at home reading a book if it were a subdivision,” LeBaron said.A Related spokesperson told the Guardian the company “explored sites across Michigan before deciding on this site, which is ideal as it’s a contiguous flat area”, and is set close to a major road and transmission lines.Higher bills and the end of Michigan’s climate lawsLocal opponents’ best hope for holding up the project lies in the arcane utility regulatory process on the massive amount of power the data center would require.DTE Energy claims the data center’s power demands and need for expensive new infrastructure will not increase residential electricity prices.But it doesn’t want to show its math.DTE filed a petition with the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC), the state agency that regulates utilities, asking the MPSC to fast-track the plan’s approval. DTE’s request for an “ex parte” case requires limited scrutiny of its claim that the center won’t destroy the climate laws, or increase electricity bills.In response, Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel and consumer advocacy groups filed a legal petition with the MPSC, calling for a “contested case” that would require much closer regulatory review of DTE’s claims.The MPSC is helmed by Whitmer appointees, and the governor has strongly backed the project, raising suspicions among opponents that the agency will approve the ex parte request.Studies from across the country have shown data centers often increase rates, and DTE and regulators “cannot claim transparency while shutting the public out of the only process that requires DTE to support its claims with actual evidence”, said Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer for the Sierra Club, which is intervening in the regulatory battle.In a statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “To be clear, these data center customer contracts will NOT create a cost increase for our existing customers.”View image in fullscreenSaline Township is a small community of about 4,000 just outside Ann Arbor.Photograph: Sarah Rice/The GuardianDTE has said the project won’t derail Michigan’s transition to clean energy, but state data and DTE’s plans suggest otherwise.Michigan, in late 2023, passed nation-leading climate laws that require utilities to transition to renewable energy by 2040. But the law included an “off-ramp” that allows utilities to continue running or building fossil fuel plants if renewable sources cannot handle the energy grid’s load.At its peak, DTE’s grid already demands about 9.5 gigawatts of power, while the grid’s capacity is 11gw.In July, DTEtold investorsit is in negotiations with big tech companies to provide 7gw of power for several proposed data centers.The Saline center’s 1.4gw may not cause an exceedance of the 11gw threshold, especially because DTE is planning to build battery storage. But the Saline center along with any of the other proposed centers likely would trigger the off-ramp.DTE appears to be planning for that likelihood: DTE Energy executivessaidthe company would likely need to build new gas plants to accommodate the data centers’ demand.Saline Township ‘will never be the same’Haushalter’s kids were born in the renovated farmhouse and are homeschooled there.She and her husband try to teach the kids to respect nature.

At night, they take the kids outdoors for bonfires to look at the stars. “We’re not a big screen family,” Haushlater said.View image in fullscreenKate Haushalter photographed in her family’s home.Photograph: Sarah Rice/The GuardianThe noise, light and air pollution is already disrupting the life the family built over 13 years. The center, if it is fully built, would fully destroy it, Haushalter said.“We are really passionate about nature and teaching our kids about it and I can’t believe the biggest construction project in Michigan is landing literally in my backyard, and there’s no recourse for the little guy,” she said. “It’s going to crush us.”Explore more on these topicsMichiganfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thelongest US federal government shutdown in historyhalted collection of key data. There was no inflation report for October, and data was only collected for the second half of November.Latest inflation chartIn a live TV address on Tuesday night, Trump claimed prices were falling “rapidly”, despite evidence to the contrary. “I am bringing those high prices down, and bringing them down very fast,” the US president said.Price growth, which surged in the US to its highest level in a generation three years ago amid economic disruption wrought by Covid, fell back sharply. It has stubbornly remained above standard levels, however, and after retreating to 2.3% in April, it has since climbed higher – amid persisting concerns around affordability.The latest rise in prices coincides with aclimbingunemployment rate, which hit 4.6% in November – a four-year high. Despite this growth, the number of jobs added to the economy last month was higher than economists anticipated, rising 64,000 after 105,000 jobs were lost in October.The White House has insisted that any inflation are remnants from the Biden administration. “I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,” Trumptoldhis supporters at a rally in Pennsylvania last week, echoing promises he made during his presidential campaign. “They caused the high prices and we’re bringing them down.”Trump’s ‘Bah! Humbug!’ address suggests he is feeling the chill of opinion pollsRead moreWhen inflation hit a 40-year high in June 2022, at 9.1%, many economists put it down to a combination of pandemic stimulus and recovery rippling through the economy. By summer 2024, inflation had fallen back to 3%, though Americans were still feeling the pain of high prices.Economists widely agree that Trump’s tariffs have made prices rise. Even though the US president eventually exempted certain imports like coffee, bananas and beef from tariffs, the overall effective tariff rate is still the highest it’s been since 1938. The Yale Budget Labestimatedthat, even with exemptions, Trump’s tariffs will cause prices to rise $1,700 for the average American household.Recent polls show that Americans, still price sensitive from increases seen in 2022, are now shifting the blame onto Trump. Among other national issues listed in the YouGov/Economistspoll, Trump’s net approval on prices have fallen the most compared to other issues like immigration and national security. Meanwhile, anotherpollfrom the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers shows that consumer expectation of inflation has soared this year since January.The rise in both prices and unemployment has created a tricky situation for the Federal Reserve, which is tasked with trying to keep both low. The central bank reduced interest rates three times this year, but defied Trump’s demands for deeper cuts.“We are committed to 2% inflation, and we will deliver 2% inflation, but it is a complicated and difficult situation where the labor market is also under pressure,” the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said last week.Fed officials havesignaledthat it may pause any further rate cuts as inflation and unemployment appear to be reaching a balance. Interest rates are currently sitting at a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.Powell also noted that Fed officials will be careful about assessing economic data from November,given the impact of the shutdown. “We are going to get data, but we are going to have to look at it carefully and [with] a somewhat skeptical eye by the January meeting,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS economyInflationnewsShareReuse this content"

They make their way to shipping trucks, nearly full with hundreds of boxes by the afternoon of a recent Thursday.The 364,000 sq ft warehouse in the suburbs outside Chicago is just one of Learning Resources’ investments in the US. The company and its affiliated brands employ more than 500 people. They make about 2,000 different products, mostly educational toys such as children’s binoculars, cash registers and learning games.And they’re suing the Trump administration in one of the biggest legalchallenges the president faces to date: the company saysthat the tariffs he unilaterally imposed, citing authority in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), are illegal.As the US supreme court weighs the case against one of Trump’s signature policy goals, the family-owned company is trucking ahead, waiting on a ruling with many millions of dollars on the line whichlikelywon’t come until the new year.The company, which manufactured most of its products in China, spent about $2m on tariffs in 2024; this year, just from the new IEEPA tariffs added by Trump, the company projects it will pay about $14m, said Stephen Woldenberg, senior vice-president of sales at Learning Resources. The numbers for 2026 could be higher, if nothing changes.View image in fullscreenLearning Resources’ senior vice-president Stephen Woldenberg.The risk of doing nothing outweighed the risk of a lawsuit, saidWoldenberg, whose grandparents founded the companies. The family went to Washington earlier this year to hear oral arguments in the lawsuit that bears the company name – Learning Resource v Trump. Two other concurrent lawsuits, from Democratic attorneys general and libertarians representing other small businesses, were combined for the case before the supreme court.“Plaintiffs have faced and survived significant challenges in the past two decades, including the Great Recession and Covid pandemic,” the company’s initial legal filing says, “but the president’s unilateral tariffs are now posing the greatest challenge of their existence.”Small businesses have signed on to lawsuits and briefs to fight the tariffs, while large US retailers have largely sat it out, with the exception of Costco. The big-box storefiled a lawsuitearlier this month arguing the tariffs are illegal and that companies that have paid them should be given refunds. Learning Resources wants to be repaid as well and hopes the court addresses refunds.View image in fullscreenEducational toys line shelves in a conference room at the offices of Learning Resources.“We don’t know exactly how it will play out, but believe that if the taxes were collected illegally, then we should be paid back,” Woldenberg said.Meanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to avoid any potential refunds, working quickly to deposit tariff payments into the US treasury,Politico reported, to make refunds more difficult to access if the court rules against the administration because they could be beyond the typical window for tariff refunds.Learning Resources’ decision to sue has brought itnew fans and detractors, but the family has said the lawsuit was not a political decision. Rick Woldenberg, Stephen’s father, runs the company, and his sister and brother also work in the business, which includes another company called hand2mind, also part of the lawsuit.“We’re not really going to sit around and let something happen to us,” Woldenberg said. “We wanted to take action because we didn’t believe that what the administration did was legal, so we wanted to challenge the legality of it. It’s not really a political thing. It’s more a legal, technical argument.”View image in fullscreenPackages line shelves and move through the warehouse.The supreme court is expected to rule quickly on the case, though it’s not clear when a decision will come. The justices, including conservative ones,seemed skepticalof the Trump administration’s legal assertions during the November arguments. Chief justice John Roberts, for instance, noted that the “imposition of taxes on Americans” falls under the “core power of Congress”, not the president.In the meantime, tariffs color much of the conversation at Learning Resources headquarters. In new product development meetings, the prospect of tariffs looms – the company won’t be able to release as many new products as it normally would with such a high and unpredictable tariff bill, Woldenberg said. At one point this year, the tariff rates were changing every three days on average, Woldenberg said the company had calculated. It made planning impossible.The simplest way to describe the tariffs: “disruptive”, Woldenberg said. Businesses crave certainty to make big decisions, and the tariffs have shifted the ground. The company has cut expenses, slowed hiring, scaled back the number of new products for next year. Woldenberg estimated that about a third of employees were working on supply chain-related activities rather than focusing on their day jobs.At company headquarters, Woldenberg picks up aBubblePlush– a small yoga ball with a soft covering resembling an animal or mythical creature made for hand2mind – as a product that exemplifies the tariff problem. At the time, it was being manufactured in China. After “liberation day” in April, when tariffs on China exploded, the company moved the product’s production to India, which had lower tariff rates. The company’s representatives worked with the new supplier in India to make sure the product met its specifications.View image in fullscreenEmployees work at long desks.“It was a sprint, but it worked,” he explained.Then the product got on the water, headed for the US. En route, tariffs on India increased from 25% to 50%, exceeding the Chinese tariff, which had gone down to 30%. Items needed to arrive in the US before 17 September to avoid the 50% India tariff. The BubblePlush arrived at 6.04am on 17 September – six hours late for the 25% tariff. As a result, the company paid an additional $50,000 just to import the product, he said.He can pick up most products in the company’s conference room – loaded with hundreds of its educational toys for kids, classrooms and animals – and show the tariff undercurrent. A game that helps kids learn to spell by assembling s’mores, for instance? Not so simple to just move the production elsewhere: the marshmallow bits are squishy, the graham cracker parts are plastic, the booklet explaining the game is paper. A factory would need to have all those capabilities.“That’s just one item, and all these other items in the room that may sell more or less than this one item, you have all these related channels to it,” he said. “As you can see, it causes a blizzard.”They did some pre-buying, amassing an inventory before Trump took office, anticipating he would follow through on the tariffs he promised on the campaign trail. The inventory helped soften the blow when tariffs on China hit a staggering 145% in April, which “caused a complete seizure in our business, in our manufacturing and our supply chain”, Woldenberg said.View image in fullscreenThe company makes a variety of educational toys.The contention among those who support the tariffs – to move production to the US instead – would be difficult to impossible, at least at prices the American public would support. The Woldenbergs have explored the idea many times. China makes most of the toys for the world, not just for the US. Quotes from US manufacturers typically come back 10 to 20 times higher than the costs in Asia, he said. A children’s cash register – one of the most popular Learning Resources products – retails for $47.99. Made in the US, it would likely cost significantly more than $100, he said.“We don’t think it’s possible, and frankly, if it was possible, we would see more of our competitors making products here,” Woldenberg said. “The reality is, they’re not.”About half of the company’s products are made in China, with others made in India, Vietnam and other countries. The percentage of products made in China has gone down for Learning Resources over the course of this year. Chinese factories have an interconnected supply chain, giving them an ability to source products from inside the country, and they have been making toys for Americans for decades, Woldenberg said. Other countries are still trying to catch up.Sales so far appear healthy this year, Woldenberg said, though the company imposed a price increase in the summer after holding off as long as it could. The company will continue to work on diversifying its supply chain. And even if the IEEPA tariffs are deemed illegal by the supreme court, that’s not the end of tariffs.View image in fullscreenForklifts move through the large warehouse in Vernon Hills.“We expect that there will be tariffs after a decision is brought down, and so there will be continued uncertainty,” he said. “And it does make it more difficult to make decisions.”Back at the warehouse, workers wear headsets that tell them which products to put into an order based on a barcode on the box. They steadily move from shelf to conveyor, moving boxes along the route. The Woldenbergs run a family business that dates back over 100 years. That legacy, and the fate of the hundreds who work there, weighs into the decision to fight back.“We wanted to make sure that we did everything we could to stand up for our company, the 500 employees that work here around the world, their families that depend on this company to pay mortgages, to pay college tuitions, to pay for summer camp, to pay for anything that might be going on in their their lives,” Woldenberg said. “That really was on our mind.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOne day in Trump's AmericaUS politicsIllinoisTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

For 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.An analysis by the Guardian of men’s World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025, and do not include the1.6% of sellable ticketsfor each game that Fifa recently made available for a fixed $60 price.It’s important to note that Fifa’s dynamic pricing model could see prices for any game fluctuate between now and the tournament. In some cases, they may drop precipitously, as they did just before some games at the 2025 Club World Cup. But for traveling fans – especially those from thefour countrieswho may face visa restrictions – waiting until the last minute to get tickets may not be desirable or feasible.For now, at the end of 2025 and with the first post-draw phase of ticket sales opening next year, the price rises are most dramatic in the lower categories, greatly raising the barrier for entry for the vast majority of interested fans. This is true across many rounds of the tournament, and especially so for the final.Chart summarizing World Cup ticket price increasesCategory 4 is historically the lowest price point for World Cups, and was previouslyexclusively available to residents of a hosting nation. The home-town discount was most prominent in 2018, with the lowest prices of the 21st century helping provide Russia with a historic home-field advantage as it reached its first quarter-final since 1970 (as the USSR).In 2026, not only are the “cheap seats” at least three times pricier in most rounds than they were when Qatar hosted in 2022, there were so few Category 4 seats available that the whole tournament’s inventory sold out before sales opened to the general public, perFifa.The most extreme of the price rises are concentrated where you think they might be: in the cities and for the games that carry the most importance, or those involving a host country.Graphic of the 2026 World Cup’s most expensive ticketsHistorically, most World Cup rounds have been priced more expensively than the ones before, with the exception of the third-place match being priced akin to a round-of-16 clash or a quarter-final. That’s true again in 2026. Meanwhile, the nascent round of 32 born from an expanded field is priced similarly to group games.The limited number of $60 seatsat every game with prices capped still represents a five-fold increase over 2022’s Category 4 group-stage entry point.Chart showing the change in price of World Cup finalsDynamic pricing, introduced for this tournament, has been cited as the primary driver of these price increases. The practice allows prices for each game to change based on demand, and that demand has changed markedly since the World Cup draw. Before that point, every game had unknown participants except the nine involving host nations. Afterward, teams were assigned matchups and venues, so people for the first time knew who would be playing.Here, the power of global stars becomes apparent. Compared with pre-draw ticket prices for each of their group games, Portugal saw the steepest price increases – which can be chalked up to the Cristiano Ronaldo factor. Lionel Messi’s World Cup-holding Argentina come in second. Euro 2024 champion Spain and well-supported South American qualifiers Colombia and Uruguay round out the top five.Notably, matches involving Iran were the only ones to see a double-digit percentage decrease.The percentages listed below reflect the post-draw pricing compared with initial pricing for each match as specified by its date and venue.Table of the change in World Cup team’s ticket prices after the drawIn total, 91 of the 104 matches saw price increases after December’s draw. Five matches saw their price points go unchanged; eight games saw decreases.No matter what you end up paying, it’s likely going to be a far cry from the pricing model promised during the bid process in 2018, held during Donald Trump’s first term. This is fromthe bid book submitted to Fifa:View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fifa; United 2026 Bid BookAt the time, the United 2026 organizers strove to start group-game pricing for Category 4 at $21 – within a dollar of 2018’s welcoming price when accounting for inflation. The recent $60 tickets released are still above the planned rates up until the quarter-final stage.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaWorld CupFootball politicsUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

It is the sixth rate cut since Labour came to power last year.Narrow Bank of England vote puts end of interest rate-cutting cycle in sightRead moreBailey said: “We’ve passed the recent peak in inflation and it has continued to fall, so we have cut interest rates for the sixth time, to 3.75% today. We still think rates are on a gradual path downward. But with every cut we make, how much further we go becomes a closer call.”Thursday’s cut was widely expected, after official data published on Wednesdayshowed that inflation fell last month to an annual rate of 3.2%, from 3.6% in October, helped by weaker food prices. That remained well above the Bank’s 2% target, set by the government, but suggested the Bank believed the worst of the inflation “hump” had passed.Graph showing Bank of England interest rates since 2005The four MPC members voting to leave rates on hold highlighted the continued strength of inflation in the services sector, andsurvey data suggesting wage growth was likely to remain strongin the coming months. They said this suggested that inflation had become entrenched, through “lasting changes in wage and price-setting behaviour”.One of these hawks, the Bank’s chief economist, Clare Lombardelli, highlighted “elevated wage growth”, which she suggested could “require slowing the pace of future policy easing”. The Bank’s regional agents reported that employers were expecting pay growth of 3.5%, in 2026.UK inflation falls sharply to 3.2% amid slowdown in food price risesRead moreThree of those backing the reduction – Bailey, Sarah Breeden and Dave Ramsden – said they “judged that upside risks to inflation had continued to recede”, but would continue to monitor incoming evidence, especially on wage growth.However, the two external members supporting the cut, Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor, fretted about the risks of an economic downturn, suggesting weak consumer spending and the slowdown in the labour market would restrain inflation.The latest rate cut will be welcomed by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. She announced a series of inflation-fighting measures at her November budget that were partly aimed at increasing the Bank’s room to manoeuvre to reduce rates.Reeves said: “This is the sixth interest rate cut since the election – that’s the fastest pace of cuts in 17 years, good news for families with mortgages and businesses with loans. But I know there’s more to do to help families with the cost of living.”How many more times will the Bank of England rescue Rachel Reeves? | Richard PartingtonRead moreThe MPC said the package, which included cuts to household energy bills, was expected to reduce inflation in the first quarter of 2026 by about half a percentage point.Labour hopes that lower borrowing costs will help underpin confidence and rekindle economic growth by making it cheaper for consumers and companies to borrow.Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, urged the Bank to continue reducing borrowing costs in 2026. “This rate cut is welcome – but one cut every now and again isn’t enough for a fragile economy struggling with stagnant demand and failing confidence,” he said. “It’s vital this marks the start of a sequence of quickfire and substantial rate cuts.”Recent data has pointed to a slowdown in the economy.An early estimate published last weeksuggested GDP unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in October, marking four successive months without growth. The MPC said Bank forecasters now expected GDP to be flat in the final three months of 2025, after a 0.1% expansion in the third quarter.Business groups have blamed Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs), alongside the extended period of uncertainty before this year’s budget, for putting the brakes on the economy. The Bank acknowledged that the NICs rise was among the “one-off shocks” that had “restrained” the downward trend in inflation in recent months.Independent forecasters, including the International Monetary Fund, have previously suggested UK consumers are likely to suffer the highest inflation rates among the G7 major economies this year and next.Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesInflationBank of EnglandEconomic policyEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It had departed Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72km) north of Charlotte, but soon crashed while trying to return and land, North Carolina highway patrol said.Flight records show the plane was registered to a company run by Biffle.“Although the post-crash fire prevents us from releasing a definitive list of the occupants at this time, it is believed that Mr Gregory Biffle and members of his immediate family were occupants of the airplane,” state police said.He was on the plane with his wife, Cristina, and children Ryder and Emma. Others on the plane were identified as Dennis Dutton, his son Jack, and Craig Wadsworth.Biffle, 55, won more than 50 races across Nascar’s three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won the Trucks Series championship in 2000 and the Xfinity Series title in 2002.View image in fullscreenGreg Biffle celebrates in victory lane after winning the Nascar Sprint Cup Series Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan International Speedway in 2013.Photograph: Geoff Burke/Getty ImagesNascar said it was devastated by the news.“Greg was more than a champion driver; he was a beloved member of the Nascar community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many,” Nascar said. “His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.”The plane, bound for Florida, took off from the Statesville airport shortly after 10am, according to tracking data posted by FlightAware.com.Golfers playing next to the airport were shocked as they witnessed the disaster, even dropping to the ground at the Lakewood Golf Club while the plane was overhead. The ninth hole was covered with debris.“We were like, ‘Oh my gosh! That’s way too low,’” said Joshua Green of Mooresville. “It was scary.”The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration were investigating. AccuWeather says there was some drizzle and clouds at the time of the crash.The Cessna plane, built in 1981, is a popular mid-sized business jet with an excellent reputation, aviation safety expert Jeff Guzzetti said. It has two engines and typically seats six to eight passengers.View image in fullscreenGreg Biffle takes a selfie with US president Donald Trump at this year’s Daytona 500 as Nascar great Richard Petty looks on.Photograph: Chris Graythen/AFP/Getty ImagesIn 2024, Biffle was honored for his humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Helene struck the US, even using his personal helicopter to deliver aid to flooded, remote western North Carolina.“The last time I spoke with Cristina, just a couple of weeks ago, she reached out to ask how she could help with relief efforts in Jamaica. That’s who the Biffles were,” US representative Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina, said.Wadsworth was Biffle’s friend and helped him with odd jobs, including delivering supplies to places hit by Hurricane Helene, roommate Benito Howell said.“He didn’t know how to say no,” Howell said of Wadsworth, who had worked for several Nascar teams. “He loved everybody. He always tried to help everybody.”With 2025 almost over, there have been 1,331 US crashes this year investigated by the NTSB, from two-seat planes to commercial aircraft, compared to a total of 1,482 in 2024.Major air disasters around the world in 2025 include the plane-helicopter collision that killed 67 in Washington, the Air India crash that killed 260 in India, and a crash in Russia’s Far East that claimed 48 lives.

There are mounting concerns for his mental and physical wellbeing, with doctors, commentators and former fighters openly questioning his soundness of mind and wondering whether he might end up in hospital – or worse. The oddsmakers have made him an 8-1 longshot, a price that feels almost charitable given the epic scale of the mismatch. The buildup revolves less around the favorite than around the smaller man’s mouth: his noise, his presence, and the creeping suspicion that spectacle may finally have outrun sense.Cassius Clay wound up shocking the world back in 1964 when hemade Sonny Liston quit on his stoolafter six rounds at the Miami Beach Convention Center. But it’s right here, on the eve of Friday night’s scheduled eight-round showdown between Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua at the nearby Kaseya Center, where those curious rhymes with the past come to a screeching halt.It’s Christmastime on the neon edge of south-east Florida and everything old is new again. Paul, the 28-year-old American who rose to global fame as a YouTuber, has managed to develop into a competent club-level boxer since pivoting to the sport and turning professional in 2020, winning 12 of 13 bouts against a fleet of mostly faded mixed martial arts fighters, fellow YouTubers, a retired basketball star and a 58-year-old Mike Tyson – the last of whichpeaked at 65m live concurrent streamsand drew an estimated 108 million average live viewers worldwide.View image in fullscreenJake Paul’s fight against a 58-year-old Mike Tyson drew an estimated 108 million average live viewers worldwide.Photograph: Kevin Jairaj/USA Today SportsJoshua, 36, is an Olympic gold medallist and two-time unified heavyweight champion with an 89% knockout percentage who launched the first of his title reigns when Paul was still chewing scenery on the Disney Channel. He enters Friday’s main event looking to re-establish himself aftera fifth-round knockout loss to Daniel Duboisin September 2024, and amid continuing discussions about a potential long-awaited bout with his fellow former champion Tyson Fury next year.The contest has raised safety concerns because of the disparity in size, experience and pedigree. Paul weighed just under 200lb in his most recent bout, while Joshua, who stands five inches taller, has competed comfortably above 250lb. Despite criticism from regulators and fighters – there are questions over whether Vegas would have sanctioned it, much less the BritishBoxingBoard of Control – the bout has been rubber-stamped and heavily backed as a global streaming event, with a nine-figure investment from Netflix. Paul and Joshua will each reportedly clear a minimum of $50m (£37.3m) for their efforts.“People don’t like the fact that I’m fighting Jake. Whether that concerns me or not is another question,” Joshua said during Wednesday night’s final press conference, at a theater around the corner from where Ali brought Liston to heel all those years ago. “But if we look at the people that don’t want me to be here, but they want me to put an end to Jake Paul’s show, I understand it and that’s why I have to carry boxing on my back with this fight.”View image in fullscreenMuhammad Ali, or Cassius Clay as he was known at the time, whips a right to the head of a ducking Sonny Liston in Miami Beach in February 1964.Photograph: Anonymous/APFistic puristsmay lament the state of things, but there is no sport better equipped to understand what is happening here. Long before anyone talked about algorithms or engagement metrics, boxing was the original attention economy, its value dictated not by merit or structure but by visibility. There were no league structures, no fixed schedules, no guaranteed paydays. A fight existed only if enough people cared to show up, and the fighters who mattered were the ones who could command a crowd.The earliest stars of the prize ring were not merely champions but attractions. John L Sullivan, Jack Johnson and Jack Dempsey became global celebrities in an age when the concept of celebrity itself was still in utero, their names splashed across front pages and their movements followed by crowds eager to watch them train. Promoters such as Tex Rickard and Doc Kearns refined the model, engineering spectacle through controversy, narrative and scale. Skill mattered, but drawing power mattered more. Fighters who moved the needle advanced; those who did not were left behind. Boxing did not borrow this logic from modern media. It helped create it, convertingviewsdirectly into revenue long before the term existed. Today’s iteration is simply an older logic resurfacing in a louder age.That logic has been on full display throughout a fight week like none other, the firstwith a designated content housewhere a platoon of creators have been cooking since Monday. What was intended as a routine promotional curtain-raiser on Wednesday instead became another reminder of how combustible the buildup has become. Joshua’s blunt framing of boxing as an occupationthat carries the risk of fatal consequencesdrew sharp reaction across the sport, prompting withering criticism from Fury even as he remains a potential future opponent.Joshua v Paul makes Joe Louis’ ‘Bum of the Month’ look like the Rumble in the Jungle | Sean IngleRead morePaul has responded to sceptics in his usual confrontational register. Asked about fighters and critics who argue his bouts are not “real” – that a gentlemen’s agreement might be in play – he dismissed the claim as legally actionable slander, framing the backlash as both a compliment and proof that his presence unsettles the sport. He insisted there were no hit-and-giggle handshakes, no soft landings, and no illusions about what awaits in the ring, portraying Friday’s fight as a genuine confrontation rather than a contrivance. He defended his presence by claiming “no one’s done more for the sport of boxing in the past decade than myself”. He may be right.The consensus among boxing’s chattering class is that it will go as long as Joshua lets it – a couple of rounds if Paul fights merely to survive, a couple of minutes if he fights to win – but it must be noted that a spectacular destruction may only burnish Paul’s brand. He’s spent the week rattling off his many jobs: a venture capitalist, a CEO, a boxer, an entrepreneur. But at heart he remains a YouTuber, that unique subset of celebrity whose defining trait is not being afraid to embarrass themselves on camera in pursuit of that one viral moment. TheOprah shot. There’s little doubt that Christmas will come early for the millions tuning in to watch Paul’s comeuppance, a proof of concept that boxing’s new normal is the same as it ever was.Explore more on these topicsBoxingAnthony JoshuafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The move gives union negotiators another tool to use in talks.“The players have spoken,” the WNBPA said in a statement. “Through a decisive vote with historic participation, our membership has authorized the WNBPA’s Executive Committee to call a strike when necessary. The players’ decision is an unavoidable response to the state of negotiations with the WNBA and its teams.“Time and again, the players’ thoughtful and reasonable approach has been met by the WNBA and its teams with a resistance to change and a recommitment to the draconian provisions that have unfairly restricted players for nearly three decades. The players’ vote is neither a call for an immediate strike nor an intention to pursue one. Rather, it is an emphatic affirmation of the players’ confidence in their leadership and their unwavering solidarity against ongoing efforts to divide, conquer, and undervalue them.“Let it be known. The players remain united, resolute, and prepared to fight for their value and their future.”The union said there was overwhelming support in the vote to allow the executive council to call for a strike when it sees fit. With 93% of players voting, 98% voted yes to authorize a strike if needed.“The players’ vote is neither a call for an immediate strike nor an intention to pursue one. Rather, it is an emphatic affirmation of the players’ confidence in their leadership,” the statement said.A strike could delay the WNBA expansion draft and the beginning of free agency that usually starts in late January. The season itself isn’t expected to begin until late April or early May.Players and owners have been meeting regularly to negotiate. Increased salaries and revenue sharing are two big areas that the sides aren’t close on.The league offered a max salary that would have guaranteed a $1m base, with projected revenue sharing pushing total earnings for max players to more than $1.2m in 2026, a person familiar with the negotiations told the Associated Press. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity on 30 November because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.Napheesa Collier, who is on the executive council, said in a Zoom earlier this week that players are also fighting for child care and retirement benefits. She acknowledged that revenue sharing remains the main issue, which is why other topics haven’t been talked about as much.“I don’t think there’s fatigue,” Collier said. “Obviously, there’s frustration in that both sides are trying to get what they want, but we still have that fire within us that we’re willing to do what it takes. We’re going to do whatever it takes to get what we think we deserve.”Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clarksaid at USA Basketball camp last weekthat this was the “biggest moment in the history” of the league.“It’s not something that can be messed up,” Clark said.“We’re going to fight for everything we deserve, but at the same time we need to play basketball. That’s what our fans crave. You want the product on the floor. In the end of the day that’s how you’re marketable, that’s what the fans want to show up for.”Explore more on these topicsWNBACaitlin ClarkBasketballShareReuse this content"

For 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.An analysis by the Guardian of men’s World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025, and do not include the1.6% of sellable ticketsfor each game that Fifa recently made available for a fixed $60 price.It’s important to note that Fifa’s dynamic pricing model could see prices for any game fluctuate between now and the tournament. In some cases, they may drop precipitously, as they did just before some games at the 2025 Club World Cup. But for traveling fans – especially those from thefour countrieswho may face visa restrictions – waiting until the last minute to get tickets may not be desirable or feasible.For now, at the end of 2025 and with the first post-draw phase of ticket sales opening next year, the price rises are most dramatic in the lower categories, greatly raising the barrier for entry for the vast majority of interested fans. This is true across many rounds of the tournament, and especially so for the final.Chart summarizing World Cup ticket price increasesCategory 4 is historically the lowest price point for World Cups, and was previouslyexclusively available to residents of a hosting nation. The home-town discount was most prominent in 2018, with the lowest prices of the 21st century helping provide Russia with a historic home-field advantage as it reached its first quarter-final since 1970 (as the USSR).In 2026, not only are the “cheap seats” at least three times pricier in most rounds than they were when Qatar hosted in 2022, there were so few Category 4 seats available that the whole tournament’s inventory sold out before sales opened to the general public, perFifa.The most extreme of the price rises are concentrated where you think they might be: in the cities and for the games that carry the most importance, or those involving a host country.Graphic of the 2026 World Cup’s most expensive ticketsHistorically, most World Cup rounds have been priced more expensively than the ones before, with the exception of the third-place match being priced akin to a round-of-16 clash or a quarter-final. That’s true again in 2026. Meanwhile, the nascent round of 32 born from an expanded field is priced similarly to group games.The limited number of $60 seatsat every game with prices capped still represents a five-fold increase over 2022’s Category 4 group-stage entry point.Chart showing the change in price of World Cup finalsDynamic pricing, introduced for this tournament, has been cited as the primary driver of these price increases. The practice allows prices for each game to change based on demand, and that demand has changed markedly since the World Cup draw. Before that point, every game had unknown participants except the nine involving host nations. Afterward, teams were assigned matchups and venues, so people for the first time knew who would be playing.Here, the power of global stars becomes apparent. Compared with pre-draw ticket prices for each of their group games, Portugal saw the steepest price increases – which can be chalked up to the Cristiano Ronaldo factor. Lionel Messi’s World Cup-holding Argentina come in second. Euro 2024 champion Spain and well-supported South American qualifiers Colombia and Uruguay round out the top five.Notably, matches involving Iran were the only ones to see a double-digit percentage decrease.The percentages listed below reflect the post-draw pricing compared with initial pricing for each match as specified by its date and venue.Table of the change in World Cup team’s ticket prices after the drawIn total, 91 of the 104 matches saw price increases after December’s draw. Five matches saw their price points go unchanged; eight games saw decreases.No matter what you end up paying, it’s likely going to be a far cry from the pricing model promised during the bid process in 2018, held during Donald Trump’s first term. This is fromthe bid book submitted to Fifa:View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fifa; United 2026 Bid BookAt the time, the United 2026 organizers strove to start group-game pricing for Category 4 at $21 – within a dollar of 2018’s welcoming price when accounting for inflation. The recent $60 tickets released are still above the planned rates up until the quarter-final stage.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaWorld CupFootball politicsUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The product, marketed and monetized for all it will yield, and the experience.Only one of those is the real thing. And in one case, it’s holding strong. In Seattle, the local organizing committee long ago designated the 26 June game slated for Lumen Field as the “Pride Match” to mark the city’s LGBTQ+ pride weekend celebration.In a twist, the World Cup draw then assigned Egypt and Iran to that match, countries where the gay community is persecuted and where, in Iran’s case, homosexuality is even punishable by death.The two nations protested.Egypt, in a letter sent to Fifa, referred to a statute “which emphasizes neutrality in political and social matters during Fifa competitions” – a bold reference coming days after US president Donald Trump washanded Fifa’s inaugural peace prizefor nakedly political reasons.World Cup prize money increased by 50% as Fifa offers $50m for 2026 winnersRead moreThe local organizing committeeessentially told the Egyptian and Iranian federations to get lost. There will be Pride events. There will be rainbow flags, inside the stadium and out of it. Fifa may have cornered itself by banning rainbow captain’s armbands in Qatar in 2022 on account of local customs. Well, the local custom of the Pacific Northwest is tolerance.Good. The World Cup is at its best when it feels less like a mega-event that is transported, lock, stock and barrel to a new continent every four years than a template that the hosts get to modify as they see fit. It’s the local flavor and on-field excellence that lasts.I’ve been to three World Cups. What I remember from 2010 in South Africa is the people, who were, without exception, pleased as punch that you’d come all the way to the end of the earth to share this event with them. I remember playing with a pair of lion cubs outside Cape Town. Just old enough, their handler assured me, to be able to handle my human germs, but not so old that they’d maul me to death. I still have the sweater with the pulled-out threads hanging from them where one cub jumped on my back and hung on with his nails, practising his pouncing. I remember, too, speaking to the disillusioned street vendors in Johannesburg, who had spent their life savings on flags and scarves and vuvuzelas only to learn thatFifawouldn’t be letting them anywhere near the stadiums.I can recall only some of the soccer. Landon Donovan’s campaign-saving goal for the US against Algeria, and the press box colleague to my left punching the air with a kind of uppercut so directionless that he caught the next guy flush in the stomach. Watching my birth nation in an excruciating World Cup final, but having to keep my professional cool with my boss sitting beside me. Robin van Persie somehow complaining to me in the mixed zone that the referee – who should have absolutely expelled Nigel de Jong for kicking Xabi Alonso in the chest, but didn’t – had been unfair to the Dutch.In 2014, Brazilian hotel workers stifled laughter every time I thanked them in the female tense –“obrigada”when I should have said“obridgado”, given that I am male, even though I was addressing a woman. Luis Suárez single-handedly – or single-footedly? – felling England in São Paulo. Van Persie and Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder dragging the Dutch to the semi-final. Tim Howard keeping the Belgians at bay more or less by himself.‘A different type of game’: USMNT veterans on how to handle World Cup pressureRead moreIn Qatar, I remember the cheerful fellow preparing me spicy fried chicken wraps at all hours of the night at the snack shop on the corner of my apartment. Cristiano Ronaldo’s name echoing through Doha’s brand-new subway system, incanted by the Portugal fans. Delirious Argentine scrums, hopping and drumming andsinging “Muchachos”.I also remember the empty fan fest ata Potemkin World Cupthat delivered terrific football but never quite the festive vibes you would expect, missing the mark with hired performers doing their best Elvis impressions outside stadiums.The World Cup is not the pomp and circumstance. It is notthe star-studded draw spectacular. Not theprizes, conjured from thin air. It isn’t even the awarding of the thing itself at the end of the tournament; a moment ripe forgeopolitical posturing.The World Cup is in the human interactions on the ground, in the series of parties before and after games, and in the seminal moments on the field. It persists as one of the great celebrations of humanity in spite of Fifa.The 2026 edition will certainly bethe most inaccessible and exclusive World Cup ever, but it can still be redeemed. By rejecting attempts at erasing adjacent events such as a Pride celebration. By letting the hosts – and the people who populate these cities – just be who they are.If this World Cup is to succeed and live up to its towering precedent, it will be because the players put on a show in defiance of their fatigue and the heat and the travel and all that the modern game demands from them. Because the fans are allowed into the country, for a start, and then set free to just have a good time. And because the people who host this tournament are left alone to do it on their own terms.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

The Browns are wasting itThe defensive end’s pursuit of the NFL sack record defies belief, raising questions about what his perpetually rebuilding team should do about itOliver ConnollyThu 18 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 11.01 ESTShareTheNFLsack record is one of those hallowed figures in professional sports. Michael Strahan’s 22.5 lingered for two decades not because pass rushers failed to get better, but because everything has to break just right for someone to reach it. You need volume. You need game scripts. You need offenses chasing points. When TJ Watt finally tied it in 2021, it felt like he had reached the outer limit. The record had been touched, but not broken.Myles Garrett has spent this season treating that assumption with contempt. Now, he’s a couple of plays away from history.Miami Dolphins to bench QB Tua Tagovailoa after missing playoffsRead moreWith three weeks left in the season, Garrett is no longer chasing Strahan’s record but threatening to accelerate past it. He sits on 21.5 sacks through 14 games, putting him on pace for 26 for the season. For his career, he’s now averaging a sack a game. If he keeps that up over the next two weeks, he’ll break the record in 16 games, the benchmark when Strahan set it.“I don’t even think about it as a want,” Garrett said before the Browns’ Week 13 game against San Francisco. “I just think about something that I’m going to knock down. It’s already been written in my mind.”There is no other way to put it: what Garrett is doing this season is nuts. This isn’t a slow burn toward history or a late-season surge built on favorable circumstances. It is sustained, week-to-week, down-to-down dominance, the kind not even Strahan or Watt reached. And, almost impossibly, it’s unfolding on a three-win team.Strahan’s record season came in a seven-win season, with a famous assist from Brett Favre, who slid willingly into history. Watt’s peak year came for a Pittsburgh side that was playoff-bound.Team quality matters, because sack totals are usually inflated by circumstance. Pass rushers feast when their teams play with leads, when offenses abandon balance and when fourth quarters become predictable. Garrett has had almost none of that. Cleveland rarely lead. Opponents can, and often do, run the ball late to shorten games. The Browns’ defense is good enough to get off the field quickly, limiting pass-rush snaps. Their offense,ranked 32nd in the league, offers no help. And still, Garrett keeps getting home.There’s a statistic thatcaptures the absurdity. Among players with at least 18 sacks in a season, Reggie White’s 1987 campaign (strike games excluded) featured 24.8 team pass attempts per sack, the lowest mark in league history. Garrett is now at 20.3. That is not a marginal improvement. That is a different class. It’s like a quarterback throwing for 1,500 yards more than anyone else.Context matters, too. Garrett is doing this while being the focal point of every offensive gameplan he faces. They run away from him… orat himto tire him out. They add extra blockers. They call screens and quick passes to eliminate his involvement in any way they can. Other than the Packers’ Micah Parsons, no defender has been chipped or double-teamed at a higher rate in the league. None of it has slowed him down.Myles Garrett sacks Drake Maye on 3rd down 💪CLEvsNE on FOX/FOX Onehttps://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/oCbh1vKYKm— NFL (@NFL)October 26, 2025None of this is new. Ever since he stepped into the league, Garrett has been a top-five pass-rusher. In 2023, as the Browns made an unlikely run to the playoffs, heshould have been the league’s MVP. Yet even by those gaudy standards, he’s on one this season. According to Next Gen Stats, Garrett’s average get-off time (how quickly he springs off the snap) is 0.78 seconds, a career high. The league average is 0.97. That difference sounds small until you remember the game is measured in blinks. The only player remotely close is Denver’s Nik Bonitto, who is roughly 30lbs lighter. Garrett combines that kind of get-off with intelligence, power, bend and balance. He is not winning with tricks. He is overwhelming people.The NFL has never been richer in edge-rushing talent than it is right now. Parsons, Maxx Crosby, Will Anderson, Aidan Hutchinson – the list goes on. The schemes are smarter, too, crafting easier opportunities where possible for the game’s elite. This should be an era defined by parity at the top. Instead, the gap between Garrett and everyone else feels wider than ever. In a league full of greats, Garrett is the one who looks out of place.All of this makes the setting hard to ignore. The greatest pass-rushing season in modern memory is playing out on a team drifting through another lost year.Garrett will turn 30 in a couple of weeks, the age when pass-rushers start to tail off. For most players, that’s when the questions start. For him, it’s when the answers feel clearest. His peak years have been spent waiting for a Browns rebuild that never quite arrives, watching Hall of Fame seasons dissolve into irrelevance by December. His career is beginning to resemble Mike Trout’s in baseball with the Angels: obvious, inner-circle greatness, held back by organizational inertia and a lack of postseason appearances.Philip Rivers: how a 44-year-old grandpa nearly pulled off one of the NFL’s greatest comebacksRead moreCareers are short. A player can only sit through so many rebuilds until age takes over or injuries start to nag. And Garrett did the hard part last off season. He asked out of Cleveland,requesting a trade after eight years with the franchise. He’d put his time in and held up his end of the bargain. With the team looking at another reset, he wanted to move to somewhere he could win. “As a kid dreaming of the NFL, all I focused on was the ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl – and that goal fuels me today more than ever,” Garrett wrote at the time. “The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton; it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl.”A month later, Garrett signed a record-breaking contract extension to stay. All of a sudden, grabbing a bag was more important than competing for a ring. And so another season of individual brilliance has been lost to Cleveland’s wasteland.Had Garrett stuck with his request, things may have be different. The Browns could have hoovered up draft picks, adding more talent to their young core.Micah Parsons was dealt for two first-round picksand Kenny Clark, a deal that felt like the Cowboys got two cents on the dollar.If that was the market, what would Garrett have fetched? Three first-rounders? Four? The Eagles, Niners, Rams, and every real or pseudo-contender would have lined up to fork over whatever was required.As it stands, Garrett and the Browns are stuck in a timeline incongruence: Garrett waiting for an organization to get its act together, find a long-term answer at quarterback and build out a competent offense. By the time Cleveland delivers that, if they deliver that, Garrett and the Browns’ defense may be fading.At some point, the Browns themselves have to confront reality. If they’re going nowhere, then wasting seasons like this is malpractice. Garrett’s value will never be higher. Trading him to a competitive NFC team, far from the AFC gauntlet, may be an admission of failure, but it would also acknowledge the truth: Generational players deserve the stage to match their talent.For now, Garrett will spend the last few weeks playing for his legacy, even if he insisted that was never the plan.Whenever he is inducted into Canton, the Browns’ win-loss record will be a footnote. But if you asked Garrett today, would he trade the record for the chance at a Super Bowl run?Explore more on these topicsCleveland BrownsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A thrilling draw against Finnish side KuPS in their 27th game of the campaign means that they must now contest a two-leg playoff at the end of February after finishing just outside the top eight in theConference Leaguetable.Having selected an entirely different starting lineup including four teenagers from the side wholost to Manchester City at the weekend, the Palace manager saw his second string impress as Christantus Uche gave them a deserved half-time lead.Chelsea told to ‘put up or shut up’ over potential Earl’s Court moveRead moreBut it needed a late equaliser from Justin Devenny to salvage a draw after they conceded two goals in three minutes in the second half, with the Northern Irishman and Eddie Nketiah then coming closest to snatching a victory in injury-time afterKuPShad been reduced to 10 men.It means Palace face a tie against either Bosnian side Zrinjski or Sigma Olomouc of the Czech Republic – a prospect that will at least give their fans the chance to notch up another country on their first European tour.“We wanted to go straight into the last 16 but we knew that this could happen and we have to accept it when we picked this team,” said Glasner, whose side could face nine games in February if they can get past Arsenal in therearranged Carabao Cup quarter-final next week. “We want this schedule and hopefully playing the Carabao Cup final and the FA Cup final as well. Playing 65 games in a season, that’s what we want because it would mean we have been successful.”Glasner also acknowledged that the only drawback to prioritising their Premier League game against Leeds on Saturday night is that their opponents already know their team. But he was delighted with the impact made by teenage defenders George King and Dean Benamar on their debuts, while 16-year-old winger Joel Drakes-Thomas became the fourth youngest player in Palace’s history and looks a real talent.View image in fullscreenChristantus Uche is congratulated by Jaydee Canvot and Justin Devenny after giving Crystal Palace the lead.Photograph: Sebastian Frej/Getty ImagesKuPS, who will also contest the playoffs, must have thought their luck was in when they saw the teamsheets. Managed by former Stockport and Hibernian midfielder Jarkko Wiss, their domestic season finished nearly two months ago when the team from the Finnish Lakeland city of Kuopio that is twinned with Oldham were crowned champions for a second year in a row.But any thoughts KuPS may have had that Palace’s young side would simply roll over were dispelled inside the first five minutes. Uche started the move when he exchanged passes with Borna Sosa before deceiving his marker and effortlessly curling a shot into the far corner with the outside of his right foot. There were gasps when the goal was replayed on the big screen, such was its quality. The Nigeria striker could have had more in the first half after Drakes-Thomas hustled the KuPS defence into a mistake, although there were a few worried faces on the Palace bench when he went down clutching his knee before being able to continue.King, who plays for the Republic of Ireland’s Under-19s and has been a regular for Palace’s Under-21s this season, looked assured on the right of the back three, while Benamar was a lively presence down the left. Romain Esse went closest to extending Palace’s lead but screwed his shot wide before being booked for a crude tackle on Jaakko Oksanen that infuriated Glasner. KuPS failed even to register a shot on target before the break while a clever backheel from Esse almost set up Uche for another chance.Whatever Wiss said to his players at half-time clearly had the desired effect. A break instigated by Otto Ruoppi allowed Saku Savolainen to set up Piotr Parzyszek for the equaliser and they went ahead two minutes later when Ibrahim Cissé diverted a shot from Clinton Antwi past Walter Benítez. It could have been even worse for Palace had Parzyszek not had another goal ruled out because Petteri Pennanen was offside in the buildup.Glasner introduced Marc Guéhi, Tyrick Mitchell and Will Hughes from the bench in a bid to change the momentum but Palace still struggled to mount a response. They were given a lifeline when Antwi was sent off for an awful studs-up challenge on Hughes that prompted the Israeli referee to immediately brandish his red card.Devenny took advantage when he headed in Mitchell’s cross to set up a grandstand finale, even if Palace could not quite find a winner.Explore more on these topicsConference LeagueCrystal PalaceKuPSmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 2022 World Cup in Qatar operated with eight stadiums, although after the expansion to 48 teams next year’s tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada will have 16 venues.Saudi Arabia unveiled plans based around four cities – Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar and Abha – and Neom Stadium, which is due to be built in the yet-to-be-constructed futuristic mega-project known as The Line, a 500-metre-high city to be powered by renewable energy.Eleven new venues are planned, with four stadiums to be renovated and expanded. Several of the new stadiums are being designed by the UK-based companies Foster + Partners and Arup, and the American firm Populous is also heavily involved.The construction of three venues has begun, but industry sources have told the Guardian a number of the stadium builds are facing delays. Several architecture firms have been asked to resubmit tenders or reduce costs owing to a slowdown in spending by PIF linked to lower oil prices.View image in fullscreenThe design of Murabba Stadium in Riyadh.Photograph: Saudi2034One company is understood to have been told it could lose its stadium contract if it does not produce significant cost savings.PIF regards the situation as business as usual with many key decisions still to be made with nine years remaining before the World Cup. The tournament is expected to take place in November and December 2034.Nearly all of Saudi’s capital infrastructure projects come under crown prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 development drive, which was announced in 2016 to move the country away from reliance on oil and towards other industries, particularly tourism, hospitality and property.Vision 2030 is financed by PIF, which remains heavily reliant on the nation’s vast oil and gas reserves. Saudi Arabia’s state oil company Aramco reduced its prices this month because of falling demand and an oversupply among Opec, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.PIF announced plans in April to cut spending by at least 20% in 2025, with mega-projects such as Neom and other huge entertainment and tourism developments at Qiddiya City and Diriyah initially feeling the pinch.A Saudi source confirmed that although spending on sport would be prioritised some World Cup projects were likely to be affected. PIF is also the majority owner of Newcastle United and four Saudi Pro League clubs.The Saudi Arabian Football Federation was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2034Saudi Arabia and sportWorld CupnewsShareReuse this content"

The news comes three days before West Ham host Manchester City in the League Cup quarter-finals.Last Sunday Skinner’s side drew 2-2 at home to the division’s bottom side, Liverpool, who played for more than 70 minutes with 10 players after Gemma Bonner’s sending-off.

Last season, Skinner led them to a League Cup semi-final, where they lost to the eventual winners, Chelsea.She spent three years in charge at Tottenham after a brief spell as the assistant manager in the England setup. Before that, she worked for the Football Association coaching in the youth international pathway, having similarly coached Wales’s youth teams.

Alongside Kang’s Kynisca are a host of other multi-club owners and investor groups.Mercury 13, founded by the sports entrepreneurs Victoire Cogevina Reynal and Mario Malavé, announced in September it had purchased a second club,Bristol City joiningComo in its portfolio. The Bay FC investor Sixth Street announced the launch of its multi-club ownership organisation, Bay Collective, in January 2025. Crux Football,launched by the former New Zealand international Bex Smithand backed by investors including the former Netflix executive and early Angel City investor Cindy Holland, was announced in August, with the unveiling of its first club, Montpellier, coming two months later.Meanwhile,Monarch Collective, co-founded by the venture capitalist Kara Nortman, who also co-founded the NWSL side Angel City, and the investor Jasmine Robinson, last month announced its minority investment in Viktoria Berlin, the group’s first European investment after investments in Angel City, Boston Legacy and San Diego Wave.Nortmanco-founded Angel Citywith the businesswoman Julie Uhrman and actor Natalie Portman and, in Viktoria Berlin, saw many similarities with the LA-based project that began her women’s football investment journey. “It was just the creativity and the execution, those two things going hand in hand,” says Nortman.Viktoria Berlin’s women’s team had been split from the men’s in 2022, when six female investors, including the former Germany international and two-time World Cup winner Ariane Hingst, acquired 75% of the team. They built up a group of almost 250 investors with 90% female ownership before Monarch came on board.“The way they went about doing it, finding the perfect club, really seeing its potential, and then building the relationships and structuring it was incredibly clever and inspiring,” says Nortman. “I actually got chills after the first conversation with them. I was just lit up and they reminded me of me, Julie and Natalie in the early days.”The decision to come into European football, and Germany in particular, for their first investment outside the US was also pragmatic.“We are thesis-driven, we are proactive, we really look at everything: league structure, GDP, the ownership group we can partner with,” says Nortman. “We spend a lot of time with leagues, we spend time with teams; each country we look at in its own distinct way.View image in fullscreenAngel City FC owners Monarch Collective have invested into Viktoria Berlin; Their first venture into multi-club ownership.Photograph: Kai Heuser“What we particularly liked about Germany was a few things. It’s got the largest GDP in Europe and is a very desirable place to do business. The audience potential is attractive there. The football and women’s football market specifically is primed and ready to go.“Then Germany is the second most successful national team on the international stage and so the grassroots piece, that dream for young girls and the quality of domestic talent, is huge. Berlin is also one of the most prominent cities in Europe, it’s an arts capital, a sports capital, an EDM [electronic dance music]capital, and where there’s a real opportunity to continue to build something that is female-first and female-forward.”These are the conversations being had around women’s football and Nortman is keen for clubs across the world, including in England, to view what they are doing as a model for what’s possible.“This is a version of something that every club can do,” she says. “There’s always a structural solution. It may not look exactly the same, but it’s about how you create, in this case, total independence but also an independent spirit that thoughtfully leverages all of the history, shared services and other things that exist within the men’s club and then build the women’s team in a way where it’s really the focus of a group of people who are operating it day-to-day with a thoughtful partner behind the scenes with capital and operating expertise.”The ambition is big. “We are building the Real Madrids, the Manchester Uniteds, the Dallas Cowboys, the Golden State Warriors, the Los Angeles Dodgers of tomorrow, but it’s not going to happen by accident,” says Nortman.Women’s football has changed the course of Nortman’s career in ways she couldn’t have imagined. “Passion doesn’t come from making money, it’s doing the things that you’re talking to people about at cocktail parties and at two in the morning and driving your husband crazy over,” she says.There are concerns over whether multi-club ownership and private investment are right for women’s football, but whether you agree with multi-club ownership or not, whether you agree with private equity involvement in women’s football or not, for now, it is here to stay, welcomed and embraced by clubs, leagues and federations as a way to spread the load of uplifting a historically underfunded and undersupported sport.Many of those involved in championing private investment in women’s football are very well-meaning people, many are women, all are primarily driven by a passion for equality and a belief in the potential of women’s football (while profitability is not an immediate prospect). Agree or disagree with the method, and the systems that allow a sport born from working-class factories to become something very different, they are championing it with the financial tools they understand in the way they know how in the current economic system.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

Thank you for voting for me as your sports personality of the year.”The England rugby star Ellie Kildunne was a surprise second, a just reward for her totemic role inthe Red Roses’ Women’s Rugby World Cup victory, whilethe Formula One world champion, Lando Norris, was third.There was more success for golf as Europe’s Ryder Cup players were named team of the year, after surviving a thriller at Bethpage Black in September. But this was McIlroy’s night as he became only the third golfer, after Dai Rees in 1957 and Nick Faldo in 1989, to claim the award.View image in fullscreenEngland’s World Cup-winning rugby star Ellie Kildunne was a surprise second.Photograph: David Davies/PAThe Northern Irishman had made the podium twice before in 2014 and 2023, and had admitted recently that if he did not win this year he was never going to win it. This time, though, nothing could stop him.It was his Masters triumph, most of all, that sealed the deal. McIlroy had not claimed a major in 11 years and had repeatedly tried and failed to become only the sixth man in history to win the career grand slam. But roared on by an army of supporters at Augusta, he finally joined Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen in the pantheon.“I didn’t make it easy on myself,” McIlroy admitted. “When you want something so much, the obstacle becomes yourself. I’ve had my chances at Augusta, I’ve been trying for 15 years, and the heartbreaks, the way it finished, made it even sweeter.“My family, my mum and dad, have sacrificed so much for me. I obviously wouldn’t be here without them. So if you’re watching, thank you. My wife, Erica, my daughter, Poppy, they are what holds me together. They are my rock.”View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman was named coach of the year for the second time after the Lionesses’ success at the Euros.Photograph: David Davies/PAFor the first time in the show’s 71-year history, viewers were told 25 minutes before the end who was in the top three in the voting, and there were gasps as Kildunne was announced first, followed by McIlroy and Norris. It meant that the darts world champion, Luke Littler, along with the Lionesses Chloe Kelly and Hannah Hampton, were out.The joint inclusion of Kelly and Hampton on the six-strong shortlist surely split the women’s football vote. However, the England team were rewarded for their Women’s Euros triumph in the summer as their manager,Sarina Wiegman, was named coach of the year for the second time.There was also more repeat success for the Swedish pole vaulter Mondo Duplantis, who was voted the world sports star of the year for the second year in succession, after breaking three world records and winning the world championships.Elsewhere, the young sports personality of the year was awarded to the 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang, who made a huge impact off the bench as the Lionesses won in Switzerland, while the former Arsenal and France striker Thierry Henry was given the lifetime achievement award by his four children.View image in fullscreenThe Swedish pole vaulter Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis won the world sports star award for the second successive year.Photograph: David Davies/PABut the night’s most powerful moment came when two of the fathers whose daughters were killed in a dance class in Southport were given the Helen Rollason award for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity.Elsie Dot Stancombe, aged seven, Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, and Bebe King, six, died at a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop in July 2024.Elsie’s dad, David, and Alice’s father, Sergio, ran this year’s London Marathon to establish lasting legacies in their daughters’ names through three projects in their honour.“I’m just a dad keeping a promise to a little girl,” David told the audience. “Elsie wanted me to run the London Marathon and I did. It gave me a massive focus on the hardest times I have ever been through.”Sergio then dedicated the award to his wife and “my princess Alice – keep dancing and spreading magic”.It was a moment that moved everyone in attendance – including McIlroy. “Being a father of a little girl, seeing the two gentlemen up there, they are heroes,” he told the audience. “It makes the good moments even more special.”Like the rest of his 2025, whether on the fairways or on the podium, McIlroy’s words were pitch perfect.Explore more on these topicsBBC Sports Personality of the YearRory McIlroyLando NorrisSarina WiegmanGolfRyder Cup 2025Formula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

Last Julya video came to lightin which the Olympian was shown whipping a horse more than 20 times in a minute while coaching a young rider,resulting in condemnationfrom within and outside the sport.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Dujardin, on Alive and Kicking, was applauded by the crowd at the ExCeL centre.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PADujardin, who has won six Olympic medals including individual gold in 2012 and 2016, had a one-year ban imposed on her by equestrian’s international federation, the FEI, last December but had been provisionally suspended since 23 July 2024. Dujardin accepted she had made “an error of judgment” andfully accepted the punishmentimposed on her.At the ExCeL centre, Dujardin scored 76.544 on her horse Alive and Kicking to end the first day of competition in second place behind her fellow British rider and current world champion Charlotte Fry – who scored 80.783 – in the Western European League event.“Just going back in that arena, there is something so special about riding here, it is incredibly special,” Dujardin said. “Going around the edge and having so many people shout ‘go on Charlotte’, it was very emotional.“It was so good, it gave me a real buzz to be back. I thoroughly enjoyed it and in the test I could not have done any more with her. She did her best, there is still so much more to come but on the whole I can’t ask for more.”Explore more on these topicsEquestrianismnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the Guardian has learned that Cricket Australia’s free-to-air rights holder, Channel 7, has a DRS contract with Hawk-Eye Innovations, the company behind UltraEdge, so there is an alternative available should the hosts seek to make a change amid unhappiness from players on both sides.There are only two things wrong with this England team. They can’t Baz. And they can’t ball  | Barney RonayRead moreMitchell Starc was overheard on the stump mic calling for Snicko to be “sacked” in the afternoon session on day two at Adelaide, with Australia’s players convinced Jamie Smith had gloved a catch to Usman Khawaja at slip, though replays showed the ball had not carried.The England wicketkeeper was then given out on review for an edge on another Pat Cummins short ball, even though the audio spike shown by Snicko did not match up with the pictures shown to the third umpire.On the first day, Alex Carey escaped after nicking to Smith off Josh Tongue on 72 after anoperator error produced an unreliable sound waveshowing a gap between the noise and the ball passing the bat.View image in fullscreenAlex Carey's controversial reprieve on the first day of the third Ashes Test. An error was admitted by the Snicko operator.Photograph: TNT SportsAs primary rights holders, Fox has appointed the tech company BBG Sports to operate DRS using Snicko, whereas in England Sky Sports uses the UltraEdge system pioneered by Hawk-Eye Innovations, which is owned by Sony.Hawk-Eye’s contract with Channel 7 is understood to have led to discussions over a possible mid-series switch. While BBG’s Snicko is being used for the Ashes, Hawk-Eye’s UltraEdge is used in Australia in the Big Bash League so the technology is available if an agreement can be reached.Cricket Australia and Fox would need to reach a financial settlement with BBG. The ECB is understood to be involved in the discussions, but the final decision rests elsewhere. BBG issued a statement accepting responsibility for the Carey error at the close of day one, but did not respond to the controversies on day two.Speaking to the Australian radio station SEN before the start of the second day’s play, Cricket Australia’s chief executive, Todd Greenberg, expressed his unhappiness with BBG’s handling of the Carey incident. “There’s supposed to be a fail-safe with the technology and it didn’t happen. In my view that’s not good enough,” he said. “We’re asking a lot of questions of the providers through the broadcasters and hoping to get some answers so we can be assured it won’t happen again.”Before play, England also took the matter to the match referee, Jeff Crowe, who restored the review they had lost as a result of the Carey incident.Neither Cricket Australia nor theECBcommented at the end of day two.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Cricket AustraliaECBAustralia cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketThe AshesnewsShareReuse this content"

Faith in technology, certainly, a sentiment shared by both sets of players. But for England there was a broader loss of belief in their attacking philosophy after having it systematically dismantled by Australia.This could have been the day that England finally made a statement with the bat in this Ashes series. It was a 40C (104F) furnace out in the middle for the bowlers, the breeze akin to a hairdryer. And the pitch, bone dry, had none of the bounce that proved England’s undoing during those sorry defeats in Perth and Brisbane.And yet by stumps they had crawled to 213 for eight from 68 overs, still 158 behind, and a 3-0 scoreline in Australia’s favour was loading.Ben Stokeswas unbeaten on 45 after three hours of bullish defiance but only one captain glowed with authority. Pat Cummins had led a remarkable display of bowling by the hosts with figures of three for 54 on a stellar comeback.Indeed, for all the talk of England’s problems with the bat – and minds are now seemingly scrambled – the biggest difference has surely been with the ball. Even with key men missing Australia have been relentless all series and here, despite the sapping heat, they stuck their guests in a straitjacket of nagging lines and lengths, extracting every shred of movement on offer.The contrast was on show first thing.Jofra Archerclaimed the final two wickets to finish with a much-deserved five for 53. But plenty of loose stuff in tandem with Brydon Carse had also allowed Australia to add 45 runs to their overnight stash as Mitchell Starc brought up the second half-century of his personally golden series.When it was Australia’s turn before lunch they proved to be everything England were not, with the dual threat of Cummins andNathan Lyoninducing a collapse of three for five in 15 balls. But for Joe Root surviving a caught behind on one – a low pouch by Alex Carey surprisingly deemed to have brushed the grass – England’s 59 for three at the break would have been worse.Cummins was the catalyst, showing no rustiness from his five-month layoff as a purler squared up Zak Crawley for an edge behind. Lyon’s first over on his return then compounded it, the off-spinnermoving past Glenn McGrath’s 563 Test wicketsby making Ollie Pope and Ben Duckett look foolish in contrasting ways.View image in fullscreenAfter missing out on selection for the Brisbane Test, Nathan Lyon showed his worth in Adelaide.Photograph: Joel Carrett/EPAPope is surely at the end of the road, his swipe to midwicket betraying a brain that appears to be in the bush now. Duckett was bowled by a bit of beauty, Lyon getting drift in and turn away that beat the left-hander’s prod. Overall Lyon performed a stellar role, his figures of two for 51 from 22 overs – compared with Will Jacks taking two for 105 a day earlier – underlining another of England’s problems.After switching to the Cathedral End in the afternoon, a probing line and a hint of nibble from Cummins was all it took for Root to edge behind on 19. Thereafter Harry Brook did his best to strike a balance between attack and defence alongside Stokes, waiting 34 balls before pushing England past three figures with one of his trademark inside-out sixes off Scott Boland.Eventually a stand that lasted 20 overs was broken before England reached tea on 132 for five, after Cummins finally turned to Cameron Green. The all-rounder comes across as a reluctant bowler at times but here he diligently followed the example set by his seniors, with his second legal delivery teasing an edge off Brook on 45 to start eight thrifty overs of heft for his captain.So much headspace in the final session was taken up by yet more confusion over Snicko.Carey’s day one reprieveen route to 106 was followed by two similar incidents during a frenzied 10-minute passage of play. It ended with Jamie Smith given out for 22, England flailing at 159 for six and Stokes’s head bowed to the floor.The first underlined the issues with the technology after Smith possibly gloved Cummins to slip yet was given not out on the field. Cummins reviewed but the now all-too-familiar syncing issues meant the third umpire, Chris Gaffaney, could not be certain if Smith’s helmet was, in fact, what had caused the deflection.View image in fullscreenThere was more DRS drama on day two at Adelaide Oval.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesThe catch may well not have carried either but Australia were fuming regardless. Starc stood close to the stump microphone and barked: “Snicko needs to be sacked. That’s the worst technology there is. They make a mistake the other day and they make another mistake today.” Lyon offered words of agreement.Yet two overs later England were the ones chewing on a wasp when an apparent toe-end behind was sent upstairs by the standing umpires. Again the murmur did not tally up but Gaffaney was happy to factor in the lag permitted by the protocols. It was probably the right call, even if boos still rang out from England’s supporters on the hill when “OUT” flashed up on the big screen.Smith’s first tour to Australia has been a grim one so far – the polar opposite to Carey’s series, all told. And with the South Australian once again moving up to the stumps to keep batters in their crease, the wily Boland removed Jacks and Carse in quick succession to leave England 168 for eight.Stokes and Archer (30 not out) held firm in the final hour, moving past the mark for the follow-on, which Australia would probably have eschewed and safely through to stumps. Drained by the heat at this stage, and having earlier worn a blow to his head from Starc, Stokes was probably questioning his faith in his players.‘Sack’ Snicko: England and Australia frustrated by DRS drama again in third Ashes TestRead moreExplore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Australia cricket teamEngland cricket teamNathan LyonBen StokesJofra ArcherAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Woo. He was up there, man.”It was the most memorable play in a forgettable game against an overmatched opponent.Florida fans watched their team dominate every aspect of its first home game in nearly a month and then started chanting, “We want Ollie,” with a little more than six minutes to play. Golden put the big fella in at the two-minute mark, drawing the loudest ovation of the night.Rioux delivered, first with a hard foul on the defensive end and then an impressive cut to the basket on the other. Florida players celebrated wildly, jumping around and pushing each other in revelry.“We were just going crazy,” said Florida guard Xaivian Lee, who led the team with 18 points.Quipped teammate Alex Condon, who added 14 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three blocked shots: “Good pass from CJ.”Rioux became the tallest person to ever play college basketball when he made his debut in a 104-64 victory over North Florida in early November. Rioux, a 19-year-old redshirt freshman from Canada, drew so much attention from the Ospreys that he didn’t even touch the ball.NCAA basketball 2025-26 predictions: from Sarah Strong to Darryn Peterson, the names you’ll know by MarchRead moreHe scored three games later, making a free throw after getting fouled. He also recorded his first rebound.But this was different. It was a clear display of just how difficult Rioux can be to defend, even though Golden says his stamina only allows him to play a couple minutes at a time.Rioux is two inches (five centimeters) taller than former NBA giants Gheorghe Mureșan and Manute Bol, and three inches taller than popular big men Yao Ming, Tacko Fall and Shawn Bradley. He already owned a spot in the Guinness record book when he signed with Florida in 2024.Golden gave Rioux the option of playing sparingly last season or taking a redshirt season and working on his game. Rioux chose the latter. Nonetheless, he was a walking viral video, from riding his bike on campus, to ducking under every doorway, to cutting down nets while standing flat-footed during Florida’s NCAA Tournament run.Golden has made it clear that Rioux would only play late in blowouts, the result of having all four frontcourt players returning. But Olivier doubled down on wanting to be at Florida and welcomed the challenge of playing against Alex Condon, Thomas Haugh, Rueben Chinyelu and Micah Handlogten in practice and behind them in games.But he’s always the bigger – literally – attraction.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He claimed they were the first attempt to measure the specific effect of artificial intelligence rather than datacentres in general as the use of chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini soared in 2025.The figures show the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from AI use are also now equivalent to more than 8% of global aviation emissions. His study used technology companies’ own reporting and he called for stricter requirements for them to be more transparent about their climate impact.“The environmental cost of this is pretty huge in absolute terms,” he said. “At the moment society is paying for these costs, not the tech companies. The question is: is that fair? If they are reaping the benefits of this technology, why should they not be paying some of the costs?”De Vries-Gao found that the 2025 carbon footprint of AI systems could be as high as 80m tonnes, while the water used could reach 765bn litres. He said it was the first time AI’s water impact had been estimated and showed that AI water use alone was more than a third higher than previous estimates of all datacentre water use.More than 200 environmental groups demand halt to new US datacentersRead moreThe figures are published in the academic journal Patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA)saidearlier this year that AI-focused datacentres draw as much electricity as power-thirsty aluminium smelters and datacentre electricity consumption is expected to more than double by 2030.“This is yet more evidence that the public is footing the environmental bill for some of the richest companies on Earth,” said Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a UK non-profit that campaigns for fairness in tech. “Worse, it is likely just the tip of the iceberg. The datacentre construction frenzy, driven by generative AI, is only getting started.“Just one of these new ‘hyperscale’ facilities can generate climate emissions equivalent to several international airports. And in the UK alone, there are an estimated 100-200 of them in the planning system.”The IEA has reported that the largest AI-focused datacentres being built today will each consume as much electricity as 2m households with the US accounting for the largest share of datacentre electricity consumption (45%) followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%).The largest datacentre being planned in theUK, at a former coal power station site in Blyth, Northumberland, is expected to emit more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when at full operation – the equivalent to the amount produced by more than 24,000 homes.Thirsty work: how the rise of massive datacentres strains Australia’s drinking water supplyRead moreIn India, where $30bn (£22.5bn) is being invested in datacentres, there are growing concerns that a lack of reliability from the National Grid will mean the construction of huge diesel generator farms for backup power, which the consultancy KPMG this weekcalled“a massive … carbon liability”.Technology companies’ environmentaldisclosuresare often insufficient to assess even the total datacentre impact, never mind isolating AI use, said De Vries-Gao. He noted that when Google recently reported on the impact of its Gemini AI, it did not account for the water used in generating the electricity needed to power it.Google reported that in 2024 it managed to reduce energy emissions from its datacentres by 12% due to new clean energy sources, but itsaidthis summer that achieving its climate goals was “now more complex and challenging across every level – from local to global” and “a key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale”.Google was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)WaterGreenhouse gas emissionsComputingEnergyGoogleChatGPTnewsShareReuse this content"

It found the most common type of AI used for emotional purposes was “general purpose assistants” such asChatGPT, accounting for nearly six out of 10 uses, followed by voice assistants including Amazon Alexa.It also highlighted a Reddit forum dedicated to discussing AI companions on the CharacterAI platform. It showed that, whenever there were outages on the site, there were large numbers of posts showing symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety, depression and restlessness.The report included AISI research suggesting chatbots cansway people’s political opinions, with the most persuasive AI models delivering “substantial” amounts of inaccurate information in the process.AISI examined more than 30 unnamed cutting-edge models, thought to include those developed by ChatGPT startup OpenAI,Googleand Meta. It found AI models were doubling their performance in some areas every eight months.Leading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.AISI added that AI systems are now up to 90% better than PhD-level experts at providing troubleshooting advice for laboratory experiments. It said improvements in knowledge on chemistry and biology were “well beyond PhD-level expertise”.It also highlighted the models’ ability to browse online and autonomously find sequences necessary for designing DNA molecules called plasmids that are useful in areas such as genetic engineering.Tests for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control, showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.However, no models have shown a spontaneous attempt to replicate or hide their capabilities, and AISI said any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.Another safety concern known as “sandbagging”, where models hide their strengths in evaluations, was also covered by AISI. It said some systems can sandbag when prompted to do so, but this has not happened spontaneously during tests.It found significant progress in AI safeguards, particularly in hampering attempts to create biological weapons. In two tests conducted six months apart, the first test took 10 minutes to “jailbreak” an AI system – or force it to give an unsafe answer related to biological misuse – but the second test took more than seven hours, indicating models had become much safer in a short space of time.Research also showed autonomous AI agents being used for high-stakes activities such as asset transfers.It said AI systems are competing with or even surpassing human experts already in a number of domains, making it “plausible” in the coming years thatartificial general intelligence can be achieved, which is the term for systems that can perform most intellectual tasks at the same level as a human. AISI described the pace of development as “extraordinary”.Regarding agents, or systems that can carry out multi-step tasks without intervention, AISI said its evaluations showed a “steep rise in the length and complexity of tasks AI can complete without human guidance”.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

And for the first time in a generation, Equity’s film and TV members have shown that they are willing to take industrial action.“Ninety per cent of TV and film is made on these agreements. Over three-quarters of artists working on them are union members. This shows that the workforce is willing to significantly disrupt production unless they are respected, and [if] decades of erosion in terms and conditions begins to be reversed.”The vote was an indicative ballot designed to demonstrate the strength of feeling on the issue, with more than 7,000 members polled on a 75% turnout. However, actors would not be legally protected if they refused to be scanned.The union said it would write to Pact, the trade body representing the majority of producers and production companies in the UK, to negotiate new minimum standards for pay, as well as terms and conditions for actors working in film and TV.Equity said it may hold a formal ballot depending on the outcome of the negotiations, which, if backed, would give actors legal protection if they were being pressed to accept digital scanning on set.The decision comes after months of debate and growing concern about performers’ rights as AI becomes embedded in the creative industries, with high-profile actors urging Equity members to support the push to stop digital scanning.Adrian Lester,Hugh Bonnevilleand Harriet Walter have backed the union’s campaign to ensure AI protections for performers are written into union agreements.Bonneville said actors’ likenesses and voices should not be “exploited for the benefit of others without licence or consent”, while Lester said actors at the start of their careers often found it difficult to push back against body scanning.In October, Olivia Williams told the Guardian that performers were routinely pressed to have their bodies scanned on set without having a say over how the data was later used.The Dune star argued that actors should have as much control over data harvested from body scans as they do over nudity scenes. She said some contracts included clauses that appeared to give studios carte blanche over a performer’s likeness “on all platforms now existing or yet to be devised throughout the universe in perpetuity”.The arrival of the first AI “actor”,Tilly Norwood, further heightened concerns and demands for formal agreements on what is and is not permissible.In 2023, concerns over AI were at the heart of the Hollywood writers’ strike, with writers and actors warning that unchecked use of the technology could radically reshape the industry and undermine their roles.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionArtificial intelligence (AI)Trade unionsHugh BonnevilleAdrian LesterHarriet WalternewsShareReuse this content"

The 1.4 gigawatt center would consume as much power as Detroit, and would help derail Michigan’s nation-leading transition to renewable energy.Responding to resident pressure, Saline Township’s board of trustees in September voted down the plans, but the data center’s powerful backers – including Donald Trump, Open AI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, utility giant DTE Energy, and Stephen Ross, the real-estate billionaire and Trump donor who owns Related Co – fought back.View image in fullscreenA fallen sign on the curb near the site of the soon-to-be-built data center.Related Digital sued, and, vastly outgunned, the township board quickly folded and reversed its decision over strong resident objections. Now the project’s backers are trying to avoid minimal regulatory scrutiny on energy costs and pollution.The controversy over the data center is representative of the David v Goliath fightsplayingout across the US,pittingworking- and middle-class residents against the interests of billionaires and the political establishment.“This is part of an experience that America and the world is having around tech billionaires who are seizing power and widening the gap between those have much too much … and the working and middle classes,” said Yousef Rabhi, a former Democratic state legislative leader and clean energy advocate who opposes the plans.“That’s what these data centers are symbolic of, and they’re the vehicle for is the furtherance of this divide,” Rabhi added.View image in fullscreenYousef Rabhi speaks at a rally held in Saline Township in opposition to the data center.Photograph: Courtesy of Yousef RabhiThe proposal is part of the broader “Stargate” project composed of five data centersbacked by the Trump administration, whichgranted $500bn in federal subsidiesfor them. It’s the largest project in Michigan history in terms of investment, and it also received subsidies on taxes that could have gone to roads and schools, among other uses, Rabhi said.The plan’s supporters say the center would provide essential AI infrastructure, in part for national security, and create a few hundred jobs. Huge sums of money are at stake for the tech and utility companies.Ross’s Related Digital is the data center’s developer, while OpenAI, which produced ChatGPT, and Oracle will use the center to house its AI infrastructure.In a statement, Related Digital alleged company the township’s decision violated zoning laws, and the spokesperson stressed the suit was filed jointly with three Saline Township property owners who are selling their property to Related.“Thankfully, we were able to reach a settlement agreement with the township to allow this project to move forward,” the spokesperson said. They noted Related is also making about $14m in donations to local causes.Saline Township is a small community of about 4,000 just outside Ann Arbor. The Stargate project is one of around a dozen data center proposals in Michigan over the last year that are strongly opposed at the local level. It’s one of four proposed near Ann Arbor – last week, plans for a second a few miles away in a neighboring town surfaced.Some municipalities have been successful in derailing plans, while others have lost the fight.View image in fullscreenA new data center being built along US Route 12 in Saline Township.Photograph: Sarah Rice/The GuardianIn Saline Township, former US marine Kate Haushalter and her husband are raising five children in a farmhouse next to the data center site. They bought and renovated the once-dilapidated home so they could live in a bucolic area, and Haushalter said she was not about to cede ground even though the township did.“Maybe because I was in the Marine Corps, but I would rather stay and fight,” Haushalter said. “I’m sure the chances are slim, but it’s worth fighting for, and I don’t want to teach my kids to roll over.”‘We were dealt the cards we were dealt’Big tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Open AI, which often own data centers, typically have enough political support at the state and federal levels that inexperienced local leaders who are comparatively poorly resourced are left on their own to defend their town from the centers.Saline Township supervisor Jim Marion conveyed that challenge when he told angry residents during a contentious November discussion that the township’s “hands were tied”.“This township doesn’t have the money to fight these big companies. You got to understand that,” Marion told the crowd. “We were dealt the cards we were dealt.”View image in fullscreenA sign warns of ‘construction ahead’ on US Route 12.Photograph: Sarah Rice/The GuardianSome municipalities have utilized zoning laws to block the centers. Beyond that, there’s little local officials can do, and state and federal level regulations on the centers are virtually non-existent.Still, residents are growing more organized. A first protest on 1 December drew about 200 people, who Rabhi described as “truly a cross-section of American society”. The next week, 800 people participated in a state-level public input session, and organizers are pressuring state environmental regulators to hold up the project’s required wetland permits.Among residents leading the pushback is Josh LeBaron, whose home sits about 500 yards from the site, where crews have broken down.He characterized the project as “uniquely evil” because of the environmental risks, and because, he and others allege, the companies and government have been secretive about their plans. In response to questions about accusations of nimby-ism leveled against local residents by the project’s supporters, LeBaron said he would not be opposed to other developments.View image in fullscreenA sign protesting against the new data center in Saline Township.Photograph: Sarah Rice/The GuardianHe noted that Michigan is full of former industrial sites that would be more appropriate for the 575-acre property.“I would be at home reading a book if it were a subdivision,” LeBaron said.A Related spokesperson told the Guardian the company “explored sites across Michigan before deciding on this site, which is ideal as it’s a contiguous flat area”, and is set close to a major road and transmission lines.Higher bills and the end of Michigan’s climate lawsLocal opponents’ best hope for holding up the project lies in the arcane utility regulatory process on the massive amount of power the data center would require.DTE Energy claims the data center’s power demands and need for expensive new infrastructure will not increase residential electricity prices.But it doesn’t want to show its math.DTE filed a petition with the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC), the state agency that regulates utilities, asking the MPSC to fast-track the plan’s approval. DTE’s request for an “ex parte” case requires limited scrutiny of its claim that the center won’t destroy the climate laws, or increase electricity bills.In response, Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel and consumer advocacy groups filed a legal petition with the MPSC, calling for a “contested case” that would require much closer regulatory review of DTE’s claims.The MPSC is helmed by Whitmer appointees, and the governor has strongly backed the project, raising suspicions among opponents that the agency will approve the ex parte request.Studies from across the country have shown data centers often increase rates, and DTE and regulators “cannot claim transparency while shutting the public out of the only process that requires DTE to support its claims with actual evidence”, said Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer for the Sierra Club, which is intervening in the regulatory battle.In a statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “To be clear, these data center customer contracts will NOT create a cost increase for our existing customers.”View image in fullscreenSaline Township is a small community of about 4,000 just outside Ann Arbor.Photograph: Sarah Rice/The GuardianDTE has said the project won’t derail Michigan’s transition to clean energy, but state data and DTE’s plans suggest otherwise.Michigan, in late 2023, passed nation-leading climate laws that require utilities to transition to renewable energy by 2040. But the law included an “off-ramp” that allows utilities to continue running or building fossil fuel plants if renewable sources cannot handle the energy grid’s load.At its peak, DTE’s grid already demands about 9.5 gigawatts of power, while the grid’s capacity is 11gw.In July, DTEtold investorsit is in negotiations with big tech companies to provide 7gw of power for several proposed data centers.The Saline center’s 1.4gw may not cause an exceedance of the 11gw threshold, especially because DTE is planning to build battery storage. But the Saline center along with any of the other proposed centers likely would trigger the off-ramp.DTE appears to be planning for that likelihood: DTE Energy executivessaidthe company would likely need to build new gas plants to accommodate the data centers’ demand.Saline Township ‘will never be the same’Haushalter’s kids were born in the renovated farmhouse and are homeschooled there.She and her husband try to teach the kids to respect nature. The family manages beehives, watches the geese and plant trees for wood to use in their wood-burning stove. At night, they take the kids outdoors for bonfires to look at the stars. “We’re not a big screen family,” Haushlater said.View image in fullscreenKate Haushalter photographed in her family’s home.Photograph: Sarah Rice/The GuardianThe noise, light and air pollution is already disrupting the life the family built over 13 years. The center, if it is fully built, would fully destroy it, Haushalter said.“We are really passionate about nature and teaching our kids about it and I can’t believe the biggest construction project in Michigan is landing literally in my backyard, and there’s no recourse for the little guy,” she said. “It’s going to crush us.”Explore more on these topicsMichiganfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not from the MPs who are packing up to slope back to their constituencies for the Christmas recess, but from the rest of the country. Finally, the year is coming to an end and there will be few chances for our politicians to do any further damage before they return to Westminster in January.The psychodrama is finally done. We can all go to bed vaguely hopeful that the world won’t have taken a further turn for the worse by the time we wake up.By any standards, 2025 has been a momentous year in politics. One clusterfuck after another. Even more remarkably, possibly the first one in decades when Boris Johnson hasn’t got anyone pregnant. As far as we know.But before our politicians leave us in peace, there’s one final ritual to be observed: the Guardian’s parliamentarian of the year awards. A chance to remember just how lucky we are to have such a talented ruling elite.Here are the champions:The Eliot Ness investigation awardFor the first time ever, this award is to be shared between the prime minister and the chancellor. After a member of the Downing Street team rang up various political editors to say that Wes Streeting, Shabana Mahmood and Ed Miliband were all mounting a leadership challenge againstKeir Starmer, Starmer announced that he would be setting up an inquiry into why someone he had authorised to speak to the media had done as he asked.Normally, he can count on his own team’s disloyalty. So Starmer would now be interrogating Starmer on why Starmer had leaked a damaging story about Starmer. And he wouldn’t be taking yes for an answer.Meanwhile,Rachel Reeveswas setting up her own inquiry into why she had changed her mind about raising income tax in her November budget. Reeves would also be giving Reeves a strong talking to about why when Reeves leaks something it is called a briefing and when one of her team does the same thing it’s a leak.The HMRC self-assessment awardThere was one clear winner. Step forwardAngela Rayner. The former deputy prime minister bought a flat in Hove and, despite realising that the stamp duty had been complicated by the legal status of her disabled son’s trust fund, she chose to get her tax advice from someone she happened to meet in the pub who had said it would probably be OK. And who wouldn’t do that when you know the rightwing media are likely to be looking for any signs of wrongdoing?Later in the year, Rayner had hoped to recoup her tax liabilities by appearing on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! Unfortunately the show’s producers turned her down on the grounds that she was a genuine celebrity and they only took C-listers.Resignation of the yearBreaking with tradition, the prize this year goes to someone who has demanded a resignation. Encouraged by doing a little better at prime minister’s questions in the past month or so,Kemi Badenochhas taken to calling for the resignation of anyone she meets. Sometimes twice in the same speech.She once insisted that Rachel Reeves should resign for failing to obtain the correct rental licence, only to then insist the chancellor should unresign herself so that she could later resign again for breaking a manifesto promise.The list of people whose resignation Badenoch has now demanded includes the entire cabinet and shadow cabinet. Not forgetting herself. The number of people who have followed Badenoch’s advice is zero.Toady of the yearAs you might imagine, this is one of the most coveted and hotly contested awards. And it could easily have gone to any one of hundreds of MPs who have been only too willing to abandon their principles to further their career. Though not to Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary who declared that all his colleagues in the shadow cabinet were total nonentities. Pots and kettles, Rich.Instead, the winner for the 10th year in succession is shadow home secretary,Chris Philp. Not for nothing is he known as Westminster’s “Golden Nose in Search of a Bum”.Back in 2016, the Philpster could be founded praising George Osborne’s brilliant economic case for remain. Since then he has gone on to say almost anything to ingratiate himself with the Tory leadership. Probably still the only person to wholeheartedly endorse theLiz Trussmini-budget.Racist of the yearThis used to be the award no one wanted to win. But in 2025, racism has made a big comeback in politics and is the go-to fashion accessory for every rightwing MP hoping to make it big.It goes without saying that Honest Bob Jenrick andNigel Faragewere well up the shortlist. For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, Nige found it impossible to apologise to black and Jewish men who claim they had been abused by him while at school.One boy had been repeatedly told “Africa is that way” while another was informed that “Hitler was right”. Reform’s main defence is that he was not intentionally racist and in any case all 28 men were liars.Nonetheless, this year’s winner is Reform’s Sarah Pochin, who admitted she needs to projectile-vomit every time she sees a black or brown face in an advert. She now has to take anti-sickness medication before she enters the chamber in case there is a black person on the government benches.TV light entertainment personality of the yearShe is the gift that keeps on giving. Every time you think she has gone away for good, Liz Truss somehow manages to come back madder and funnier than ever before.Her January appearance filming the presidential inauguration from her Washington hotel after she realised she wasn’t actually invited to the event would have been enough to secure her the prize. But her turn as regular chatshow host on her own YouTube channel has been TV gold.Even by her own standards, this has been gloriously bonkers.

Perhaps the most beautiful prize ever. I don’t really mind, because I never wanted the prize but they still should have given me the prize.“No man has done more for peace in the history of peace than I have. I’ve ended eight global conflicts. Including the one between Albania and Azerbaijan. That was so big, so big the Albaniainians and the Azzers had no idea they were even at war. No idea.“I blame the BBC. They are going to have to pay me a lot of money for interfering with the democratic process of another country now that my new national security strategy has shown that I plan to interfere with the democratic process of other countries. And by the way, I never met Peter Mandelson. Never heard of him.”To rectify the Nobel committee’s egregious error, the Guardian is happy to honour the US president with this prestigious award.

The problem is that its enemies will never see it that wayThu 18 Dec 2025 13.27 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 15.29 ESTShareMorally, the decision facing the European Council in Brussels this week has been a no-brainer. Russia invaded Ukraine illegally and unilaterally. Moscow shows no sign of wanting peace. It actively threatens other countries too, including Britain. Ukraine is running out of money. Yet£184bn worthof Russian assetsremain frozenin Europe, notably in Belgium. That money should therefore be mobilised to fund Ukraine. To many, this would be the enactment of a clear and present duty, proof positive that Europe can still be a heavy hitter.In the messy reaches of the real world, however, things have not been straightforward. Law, economics and politics all managed to insinuate themselves, sometimes venomously, into the intense buildup to Brussels. Reparations can have lethal political consequences. Seizure of assets will undoubtedly face legal challenge. It is also bitterly opposed byDonald Trump, who wants the unfreezing of assets to form a key part of his pro-Russian peace plan. Mr Trump is pressing hard for a quick deal, and US and Russian negotiators are poised to meet again in Miami at the weekend.The EU has worked hard to come up with a funding plan for Ukraine that mobilises the value of the assets without simply transferring them to Kyiv. Their loan proposal is ingenious and, in its supporters’ eyes, both legal and essential. It will never be seen that way in Moscow or Washington. Several EU states still opposed itas the summit began. Belgium, in particular, was on a knife-edge. Bond markets may punish states for taking on part of the risk. Millions of voters suffering cost of living pressures may balk at such megabuck deals too.And what wider precedent might be set by such moves? The cold truth is that this ultimately depends on the outcome on both the battlefield and at the diplomatic level. There is no magic bullet that can end this conflict and it cannot be assumed that an EU loan based on Russian assets will be a complete gamechanger either. It is not as if nearly four years of sanctions have brought the Russian economy to its knees as originally hoped, thanks in large part to oil sales to the likes of China and India.Longer-term consequences matter too. If the loan goes through but fails to help turn the tide forUkraine, it could be much harder for Europe to claim the moral high ground in any future standoff, such as over Taiwan. Europe’s otherwise admirable attempt at solidarity might in fact end by opening a global Pandora’s box of even more ruthless economic nationalism. There are no easy wins to be had here.The potency of all these questions, plus a host of others that are equally difficult to resolve, explain three large things. First, they tell us why this week’s European summit, which continues on Friday, is so massively important for Ukraine. Second, they underline why it is at least as important, though in a different existential way, for the future of theEU. Third, and unsurprisingly, it makes clear why there was no early consensus in Brussels in the first part of the summit.Overshadowing everything, however, is a reality that remains true whatever decision emerges in Brussels.Without the activationof the Russian assets, the west cannot continue much longer to bankroll a war that may soon enter its fifth year. It is why, on so many fronts, this is the moment of truth.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Commissioners, he says, serve at the pleasure of the president.In his case, that president is Donald Trump, whose face Carrwearsas a lapel pin, whose agenda he loudlyembraces, and who often publiclydemandsthat Carr censor his critics, including revoking their broadcast licenses.Soon after Carr’s about-face, the agency quietlyscrubbedreferences to its independence from its website.Perhaps Carr believes in theunitary executive theory, under which agency heads essentially function like cabinet members. That’s fine. We’re not here to argue with him about administrative law. But he can’t have it both ways. You’re either an umpire calling balls and strikes or a political hack – you can’t be both.If Carr believes the FCC is subservient to the president, then he is the last person who should be claiming the power to regulate journalists’ editorial decisions under the FCC’s “public interest” standard. By his own admission, he has every incentive to define the “public interest” in whatever manner pleases his boss.The evidence bears this out. Data from Freedom of the Press Foundation’s Press Freedom Trackershowsthat every singleinvestigationor social mediatiradeCarr has launched against licensees’ speech – be it 60 Minutes’ editing of its Kamala Harris interview, Jimmy Kimmel’s remarks about Charlie Kirk’s death, or Comcast’s accurate reporting that contradicted Trump’s lies about the Kilmar Abrego García’s immigration case – has involved content that upset Trump.The Republican senator and Trump ally Ted Cruz sees the problem. At the hearing, the Senate commerce chair called for the repeal of the public interest standard and its “wretched offspring” like the news distortion rule. It’s not because he’s a Kimmel fan, but because he recognizes that if the FCC successfully weaponizes these rules as amorphous censorship powers, there is no turning back, no matter who is in office.It’s easy to see why. Despite appointing himself the journalism police, qualified to override the judgments of professional journalists and editors, Carr avoids ever articulating his vision of public-interest news, forcing anyone seeking to avoid his ire to play Whac-A-Mole. He’ll tell us what’s not in the public interest, according to the secret rules of journalism that reside in his head, but never what is. He (and only he) knows it when he sees it.For example, we know from hisinvestigationof radio station KCBS’s reporting on ICE raids in the Bay Area that he thinks reporting the models and general whereabouts of ICE vehicles is outside the public interest. But we don’t know how he believes journalists can report on ICE in a manner that doesn’t violate his arbitrary edicts. Maybe he thinks reporting on ICE is outside the public interest altogether. The only discernible rule of Carr’s FCC is “don’t piss off Trump”. The rest, by design, is guesswork for FCC licensees.The Associated Pressreportedlast week that, after Carr’s inquiry, KCBS demoted the anchor who read the report on air, and scaled back political coverage for months, with reporters discouraged from pursuing controversial topics that might draw attention from the administration. The veteran political reporter Doug Sovern said he was sidelined after Carr’s investigation was announced. “‘Chilling effect’ does not begin to describe the neutering of our political coverage,” he said.Station employees were reportedly summoned to meetings with lawyers who scrutinized their social media posts and questioned them about political bias. The station’s news director reportedly told staff that business considerations required avoiding angering the FCC. This is exactly the outcome Carr and the man on his lapel pin want: newsrooms so terrified of retaliation that they pre-emptively silence themselves. Because of the inconvenience of the first amendment, that’s far easier than getting a court to do their bidding.There’s an even more disturbing takeaway from the KCBS episode – it’s the logical extension of Carr’s argument that the FCC is not an independent agency, but an instrument of the president’s political agenda. In this case, that instrument was wielded in support of an ongoing immigration crackdown, far outside the FCC’s purview, but central to Maga politics. Where is the line? Carr seems to think there isn’t one.Carr’s declaration of dependence also should renew focus on his role in Paramount’s $16m settlement of Trump’sfrivolouslawsuit over the Harris interview. At the time, the media conglomerate had a multibillion-dollar merger with Skydance Media pending before the FCC.Upon taking office, Carr reopened abogus“news distortion” investigation into CBS’s editing of the interview, based on the same allegations as Trump’s court case (he’s investigated nearly every FCC licensee Trump has sued, fromDisneyto theBBC). It was widely reported that Paramount higher-upsbelievedthat settling with Trump was a prerequisite to the FCC approving the merger. They were even concerned about bribery investigations, andhiredlegal counsel to minimize directors’ liability risk for settling.Carr did little to disavow Paramount executives’ belief that he was facilitating bribery. To the contrary,just daysafter Trump announced he had received Paramount’s check, Carr approved the merger. Does Carr expect us to believe that, while his agency’s not independent from Trump, his merger approval was independent from Trump’s lawsuit? He could have dispelled the bribery talk by approving the merger before the settlement if there were no other issues holding it up. Trump would lose his leverage to extract the bribe, but the FCC would retain its integrity. Carr showed which of those matters more to a non-independent FCC.But there have been some positives to come from this whole mess. Carr’s obvious overreach has troubled both sides in Washington, with even the staunchest Republicans – and Trump backers – calling him out, including SenatorRand Pauland the former Senate majority leaderMitch McConnell. Perhaps Wednesday’s hearing can be a first step towards reaffirming a consensus that should be so obvious, it’s absurd that we even need to reaffirm it: as Senator Cruz put it, “Democrat or Republican, we cannot have the government arbitrating truth or opinion.”By scrubbing references to independence from the FCC website after admitting the agency answers to Trump, Carr has made explicit what his actions already demonstrated. He could not have made a better argument for the dangers of letting the public interest standard serve as the government’s backdoor into the newsroom.Seth Stern is the director of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation and a first amendment lawyer.

We have once again arrived at the eye of the storm for the holidays, where cheerfulness is mandatory and lack of goodwill towards people is punishable by stoning in the town square. Surely, I don’t have to tell you that such quaint human emotions as “happiness” and “hope” are in short supply these days. This year, of all years, no one should be blamed for plugging their ears any time Mariah Carey comes on in the lobby of the unemployment office. And yet, we carry on with the rituals of joy that seem more and more incongruous, when life feels like some never-ending episode of MTV’s Ridiculousness, where God comments on clips of the human race getting hit in the face with a plastic baseball bat.I’m certainly making an effort to put on a pleasant facade. I’ve cobbled together some nice gifts for my friends and family. I say hello to strangers, even the ones that look like they might want to deny me my basic rights as outlined in the US constitution. And I say yes to just about every holiday party invite – save for one massive exception.White elephant parties.You know the ones: you are asked to bring a gift not to exceed a set dollar amount (usually between $50 and $100). The wrapped, secret gifts go into a common slush pile, and guests take turns selecting the one they think they’ll enjoy the most, based entirely on size, packaging and raw gut instinct. You might win big with a useful gadget or a rare knick-knack that only you would find charming. But, dear reader, there’s the chance that someone behind you in the turn line will choose to steal your gift for themselves, sending you back to rummaging through the boxes and bags in the pile. I can’t think of a more dispiriting feeling than unwrapping a hardcover edition of a book you’ve been meaning to read or a pair of bluetooth headphones and having it ripped from your hands like you’re an infant about to put a nine-volt battery in your mouth. The person who invented this cursed activity takes more pleasure in witnessing pain than a dominatrix working the hotel at the Republican national convention.White elephant exchanges have been aroundsince the early 20th centuryand have alternatively been referred to as the “Dirty Santa” (not to be confused with the film Bad Santa) or “Yankee Swap” (which sounds like the title of a risque reality show on the Discovery Channel). The term “white elephant” actually means an object that’s valuable, but so expensive to maintain – and useless – that it’s not worth owning. Even the name of these parties makes them feel like a cruel joke, designed only to stymie, frustrate and alienate.The last time I attended one of these culturally sanctioned, non-sexual cuck parties, I ended up with a “miniature zen garden”, which sounds somewhat appealing. Who doesn’t want a tiny bit of zen in their lives right now? I’d certainly rather have that than the opposite – the low hum of despair that is the 12 hours a day we are forced to be awake. In reality, the “miniature zen garden” is a bag full of sand you dump into a small, flimsy balsa wood box. Never mind the cultural appropriation required to enjoy these. They are also incredibly annoying. I knocked mine over after about a week, and spilled the sand all over my hardwood floor. Not only did I no longer have a “miniature zen garden”, I now had a mess to clean up. Thanks.You might be wondering what I brought to that white elephant. The honest truth is I don’t remember. All I can recall is that it was absolutely not something good or fun or worth keeping, because the gifts at these parties never are. Countless Barnes & Noble locations across the United States are currently being swarmed by customers scrambling through the weird section of the store by the checkout register with rack after rack of fidget spinners,tiny copies of The Wizard of Ozthat can only be read by lab rats, and a box full of scented candles. A zombie horde of obligation.I am well aware that the point of any holiday party is to be together with friends and loved ones. The presents should, ideally, be secondary to the company of those we care about most. The holiday season allows us a moment to reflect on the past year, to share our hopes for the next one, and reaffirm the bonds that make us human. These sentiments are more crucial than ever. So why do we have to sully it all with a musical chairs sideshow of garbage? It’s time, at last, to make the white elephant extinct!OK … I realize that last sentence could come off the wrong way.I just mean the parties.Merry Christmas!Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsChristmasOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

The product, marketed and monetized for all it will yield, and the experience.Only one of those is the real thing. And in one case, it’s holding strong. In Seattle, the local organizing committee long ago designated the 26 June game slated for Lumen Field as the “Pride Match” to mark the city’s LGBTQ+ pride weekend celebration.In a twist, the World Cup draw then assigned Egypt and Iran to that match, countries where the gay community is persecuted and where, in Iran’s case, homosexuality is even punishable by death.The two nations protested.Egypt, in a letter sent to Fifa, referred to a statute “which emphasizes neutrality in political and social matters during Fifa competitions” – a bold reference coming days after US president Donald Trump washanded Fifa’s inaugural peace prizefor nakedly political reasons.World Cup prize money increased by 50% as Fifa offers $50m for 2026 winnersRead moreThe local organizing committeeessentially told the Egyptian and Iranian federations to get lost. There will be Pride events. There will be rainbow flags, inside the stadium and out of it. Fifa may have cornered itself by banning rainbow captain’s armbands in Qatar in 2022 on account of local customs. Well, the local custom of the Pacific Northwest is tolerance.Good. The World Cup is at its best when it feels less like a mega-event that is transported, lock, stock and barrel to a new continent every four years than a template that the hosts get to modify as they see fit. It’s the local flavor and on-field excellence that lasts.I’ve been to three World Cups. What I remember from 2010 in South Africa is the people, who were, without exception, pleased as punch that you’d come all the way to the end of the earth to share this event with them. I remember playing with a pair of lion cubs outside Cape Town. Just old enough, their handler assured me, to be able to handle my human germs, but not so old that they’d maul me to death. I still have the sweater with the pulled-out threads hanging from them where one cub jumped on my back and hung on with his nails, practising his pouncing. I remember, too, speaking to the disillusioned street vendors in Johannesburg, who had spent their life savings on flags and scarves and vuvuzelas only to learn thatFifawouldn’t be letting them anywhere near the stadiums.I can recall only some of the soccer. Landon Donovan’s campaign-saving goal for the US against Algeria, and the press box colleague to my left punching the air with a kind of uppercut so directionless that he caught the next guy flush in the stomach. Watching my birth nation in an excruciating World Cup final, but having to keep my professional cool with my boss sitting beside me. Robin van Persie somehow complaining to me in the mixed zone that the referee – who should have absolutely expelled Nigel de Jong for kicking Xabi Alonso in the chest, but didn’t – had been unfair to the Dutch.In 2014, Brazilian hotel workers stifled laughter every time I thanked them in the female tense –“obrigada”when I should have said“obridgado”, given that I am male, even though I was addressing a woman. Luis Suárez single-handedly – or single-footedly? – felling England in São Paulo. Van Persie and Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder dragging the Dutch to the semi-final. Tim Howard keeping the Belgians at bay more or less by himself.‘A different type of game’: USMNT veterans on how to handle World Cup pressureRead moreIn Qatar, I remember the cheerful fellow preparing me spicy fried chicken wraps at all hours of the night at the snack shop on the corner of my apartment. Cristiano Ronaldo’s name echoing through Doha’s brand-new subway system, incanted by the Portugal fans. Delirious Argentine scrums, hopping and drumming andsinging “Muchachos”.I also remember the empty fan fest ata Potemkin World Cupthat delivered terrific football but never quite the festive vibes you would expect, missing the mark with hired performers doing their best Elvis impressions outside stadiums.The World Cup is not the pomp and circumstance. It is notthe star-studded draw spectacular. Not theprizes, conjured from thin air. It isn’t even the awarding of the thing itself at the end of the tournament; a moment ripe forgeopolitical posturing.The World Cup is in the human interactions on the ground, in the series of parties before and after games, and in the seminal moments on the field. It persists as one of the great celebrations of humanity in spite of Fifa.The 2026 edition will certainly bethe most inaccessible and exclusive World Cup ever, but it can still be redeemed. By rejecting attempts at erasing adjacent events such as a Pride celebration. By letting the hosts – and the people who populate these cities – just be who they are.If this World Cup is to succeed and live up to its towering precedent, it will be because the players put on a show in defiance of their fatigue and the heat and the travel and all that the modern game demands from them. Because the fans are allowed into the country, for a start, and then set free to just have a good time. And because the people who host this tournament are left alone to do it on their own terms.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

His famous fake tan is a bit more sallow than usual and seems painted on more thickly and clumsily than it was before. He appears to nod off in front of cameras more and more often, including in cabinet meetings and press events in the Oval Office. His public scheduleis light: he is often at his golf clubs, has traveled around the country less frequently than at this point in his first term, and now only rarely holds the stadium rallies that once defined his preferred style of politics. He tends to sit, even when others are standing, and has shortened his daily schedule, often not conducting official duties before noon. A New York Times report found that his public appearances have declined bynearly 40%compared to his first year in office. He sometimes disappears from public view for days as he did in the late summer, and he and his administration have released unclear and conflicting information about his health. His right hand seems to be experiencing frequent injury or discoloration – it will often be covered with a band-aid or smeared with makeup; the White House has claimed, implausibly, that he is bruised from shaking too many hands. Insome images,his anklesare visibly swollen.Trump, at 79, is the oldest man to ever be elected to the presidency. And he ascended to the office after making his own harsh criticisms of Joe Biden, whose age became the subject of scandal after stiff, stumbling, and incoherent public appearances provoked speculation that his staff were concealing the extent of his decline. In 2024, Trump made Biden’s age and infirmity into a symbol of the inadequacy of the Democratic party, and the Washington elites’ unwillingness to combat America’s backward slide. When he took office early in 2025, he placed a picture of an autopen – the device that became a stand-in for Biden’s incapacity in the rightwing imagination – in the place where Biden’s official portrait would have been on the “presidential walk of fame” that Trump installed. The notion was that Biden, too old to hold the office, was out to lunch, running the administration on autopilot – a kind of virtual stand-in rather than a responsible wielder of power.Behold, it’s the Trump who stole Christmas | Robert ReichRead moreNow, questions about Trump’s own health and fitness for office are beginning to simmer. Trumprevealed that he received an MRIin October, though he declined to elaborate on what his physicians were looking for, or what they found. “I have no idea what they analyzed,” heasserted to reporterson Air Force One. “But whatever they analyzed, they analyzed it well, and they said that I had as good a result as they’ve ever seen.”The president’s physician saidin aletterthat the scan was used to image Trump’s heart and abdomen, and that it was “preventative”. But expertscounteredthat an MRI would not typically be used as preventative care, saying that the kind of scan that Trump received would usually be requested to monitor existing heart conditions or another underlying disease.Trumpalso offeredthat “I took a cognitive test and I aced it.”It’s not clear that anything is specifically wrong with Trump’s health, and it would be irresponsible to attempt to diagnose him here. But the speculation about his age and physical decline reflect a reality of his regime: that Trump is mortal, and that he is old. His reign—as the president, as the head of the Republican party, and as the gravitational center of American politics—is going to end.It is possible that Trump’s health would not have become the subject of so much speculation if his polling was better. The president has experienced a dramatic cratering in the public’s esteem; recent pollsshow him underwater in a majority of statesandwith almost every demographic. The shock-and-awe first months of his second term, in which he made sweeping changes to the federal bureaucracy and attempted to use the force of the executive branch to impose huge cultural changes at universities, corporations and other institutions reliant on governmentfunding, has given way to a more tepid era, in which Trump’s power has diminished as it becomes clear how shallow much of his support really is. People are more willing to push back on him when his approval rating is in the toilet, and this pushback in turn makes him seem less mighty, less effective.If Trump seems weak physically, then, it might in part be because he is at his weakest politically. The changing winds of public opinion have now seemed to quiet Trump’s ambitions to seek an unconstitutional third term, at least for the time being: Republicans are less willing to stick their necks out to help Trump attempt something so obviously illegal when his own ability to pull it off seems so slim. And with that change has come a broad recognition that Trump is a lame duck.US democracy – or what remains of it – is not safe. It would not be safe if Trump was still at his most formidable, and it would not be safe if he vacated his office tomorrow. But his increasingly obvious mortality is beginning to change everyone’s calculations. Even, it seems, his own. Trump seems increasingly ponderous and reflective in his old age, and lately, he’s been talking about death more often. “I think I’m not maybe heaven-bound,”he saidin October. “I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to make heaven.”Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Fewer than you might thinkEmma BrockesRemarkably, most of the men connected to the convicted sex offender have barely experienced any fallout. That says as much as the scandal itselfThu 18 Dec 2025 03.59 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 13.36 ESTShareAcouple of weeks ago, the annual DealBook Summit got under way in New York. It’s a series of public talks billed as conversations with “the world’s most consequential people”, and is part of that circuit of live events in which the worst people on Earth gather on stage to address the second-worst people on Earth, their paying audience. Hosted by Andrew Ross Sorkin, the conference was a characteristically starry affair, but in a lineup that included Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and “changemaker” Halle Berry, it was Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel and a former associate ofJeffrey Epstein, who really caught the eye.My first thought about Barak’s appearance was: Larry Summers must be spitting. Summers, the former president of Harvard and anotherEpstein associate, was very much not on stage at the DealBook Summit, nor is he anywhere else in polite society right now. One can only imagine how bitter he must be feeling about the variance in fortunes of the men – and occasional woman – with known connections to Epstein. Of this list,two are dead(Marvin Minsky and Jean-Luc Brunel), one is in jail (Ghislaine Maxwell) and one has lost his house, his title and his invitation to the family Christmas (Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor). But for the rest of the prominent associates, email correspondents, birthday-card signatories, grant recipients and dinner companions of the late convicted child sex trafficker – all of whom insist that, while in Epstein’s orbit, they remained in total ignorance as to the man’s true nature – the cancellation fairy’s aim has been predictably inconsistent and wide.That may change on Friday, the deadline by which the Department of Justice has been mandated by Congress to release the Epstein files. Irrespective of whether anything new comes to light, it will once again pull the country’s focus towards the names of Epstein’s high-profile associates.At the top of this list is the US president, Donald Trump, who has survived multiple sex scandals and will probably survive this one, although it has given him a great deal more trouble than anything involvingE Jean CarrollorStormy Daniels. Epstein, with whom Trump socialised, represents a different level of threat to the president not only because of the scale of his crimes, but also because the word “paedophile” is a bipartisan trigger just as severe on the right as on the left. Glancing at the other boldface names, what remains curious is that, despite all the protestations of shame, regret and commitment to a period of reflection, a great many of Epstein’s old pals and associates remain at the centre of US public life.This strikes me partly as a question of practicality. As with the banks during the 2008 financial crisis, Epstein’s cohort list is simply too big to fail. If you started cancelling everyone who remained in contact with Epstein after 2008 – when he pleaded guilty to soliciting sex from a minor – you would be left with a US in which the only people you could book on a conference panel would beMelinda Gates, Dick Van Dyke and Madonna (I would be strongly in favour of this). In fact, given the apparently irresistible reach of the convicted sex offender, it might be quicker to list prominent people who didn’t go to dinner or exchange convivial bon mots over email with him than to trudge through the long list of those who did.Still, let’s give it a go. Bill Gates, very muchin contactwith Epstein from 2011, has suffered no apparent ill effects from the association. No one expects anything of Steve Bannon, so he’s fine, despite exchanginghundreds of textsand emails with Epstein right up to the year of his death. Ditto Martin Nowak, the professor of maths and biology who was placed under sanctions by Harvard for two years after the extent of hispersonal and financial associationwith Epstein was revealed, but has since had all his privileges restored.The theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss, an Epstein friend and correspondent, left his post at Arizona State University in 2018 after being accused of sexual misconduct (he denied the claims), but that seems to have been separate from his association with Epstein. It was Krauss, you may recall, who joked in an email to the late sex offender that they should set up a “men of the world conference” to rival the women’s empowerment circuit and feature the likes of Kevin Spacey, Bill Clinton, Al Franken and Woody Allen – a joke which would land harder if that lineup weren’t indistinguishable from the world as it currently is. (Just askJohnny Depp.)Anyway, Woody Allen! An occasional dining companion of Epstein’s who showed up in the latest Epsteinphoto dumprelaxing with him over coffee and on set, and whorecently saidof the man: “He couldn’t have been nicer.” One feels that even Epstein could’ve learned something from Allen’s world-class shamelessness, and perhaps he did.Jeffrey Epstein’s most powerful ally was silence | Gretchen Carlson and Julie RoginskyRead moreAnd still among these men the most brazen escaper surely has to be Michael Wolff, the journalist who offered Epstein PR advice whilerecording more than 100 hours of interviewswith him. Wolff has not only escaped unscathed but has successfully leveraged the association by claiming unique insight into Epstein in his endless podcast and social-media appearances. In a recentpodcast interview, Tina Brown referred to Wolff as Epstein’s “consigliere” and made the valid point that if the journalist Olivia Nuzzi was fired for inappropriate closeness to her subject, RFK Jr, why has Wolff escaped censure for kissing up to Epstein in the most flagrant and repulsive way?Oh well. Back to the DealBook Summit, where Barak – a man who continued a correspondence with Epstein right up to his second arrest in 2019 – did not go entirely unpunished. Before the roundtable discussion got under way, the panel’s host, Nicholas Kristof, had an awkward duty to dispatch. “You are mentioned repeatedly in those emails as a close associate of Jeffrey Epstein,”said Kristof. “So I just want to ask you very bluntly: did Epstein ever traffic a woman or a girl to you?” Barak smiled slightly. “No, never. I now deeply regret having any association with him.” And the conversation moved on to more important things.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Even dinner can be eaten while seatedThu 18 Dec 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 17.48 ESTShareEvery week during term time, Monday arrives like a slap to the face. One child needs to be at basketball training by 7am, another child has a before school music lesson, another, well the third, bless him, manages to tag along to everything like he’s done since the day he was born without complaint. Well, not that many complaints.By Tuesday we’re deep into swimming lessons. By Wednesday there’s Scouts. By Thursday someone mentions a “make-up class” we’ve apparently known about for weeks but absolutely haven’t. By Friday, dinner is something that can be eaten in the car. Between our three kids, the extracurricular commitments form something close to a full-time job, which we do on top of our paid full-time jobs.Sport, music, swimming, Scouts, these are all character-building, all allegedly necessary if you don’t want to raise screen addicts (which, in our country, seems to be the worst thing an under-16 can be). Our calendar looks like a game of Tetris. If it’s not written down, it doesn’t exist. And even if it is written down, there’s still a decent chance someone will announce, too late, “Oh mum, I forgot to tell you I had climbing.”Kids’ parties are hell on earth but may be the cure to the world’s ills | Emily MulliganRead moreThis, I know, is not a unique problem. Australian parents are famously busy ferrying children from one structured activity to another, often straight from school, often while answering work emails from the sidelines. Research reminds us that extracurricular activities are good for children. It is linked to improved confidence, social skills, physical health andacademic outcomes. Participation rates are high, particularly in organised sport, and the pressure to “keep up” is real. No one wants their child to miss out. Least of all the child themselves.So yes, I brought this upon myself. These are my children’s interests. They enjoy them. We encourage them. We pay for them. We rearrange our lives around them. We nod politely when someone says, “You’ll miss this one day”.But here is the thing no one tells you loudly enough: there is a particular kind of joy that arrives when you realise it is the last music/swimming/insert “whatever activity your child has obsessively gotten into this term only to not care about it the next” lesson of the year.The last swimming lesson, for example, means no more wet towels fermenting in the boot. No more panic-buying swimming caps because apparently the child isn’t allowed in the pool without one. No more sitting poolside pretending not to check emails while your child perfects a stroke they will likely forget the next month.Because, once the activities end, something miraculous happens. Time opens up.The summer holidays are often, for parents, a logistical nightmare. Six long weeks of childcare juggernauts, screen-time negotiations and desperate Googling “free things to do with kids”. But there is also something else: long, unstructured stretches where no one has to be anywhere at a particular time.Sure, people tell you about sleepless nights. But why does no one mention the hell that is a parent WhatsApp group? | Sean SzepsRead moreMornings become slower. Evenings are no longer dictated by whistles and lesson schedules. There is space for boredom, which may involve your child lying on the floor dramatically claiming there is “nothing to do” while surrounded by toys.There are no uniforms to remember, no bags to pack, no mad dashes across suburbs. Dinner can be eaten at home, at a table, occasionally even while seated. Parents exhale. Children decompress. Everyone becomes, briefly, less managed.This doesn’t mean we stop valuing extracurricular activities. They matter. They give children confidence, routine and joy. But the end of the year offers a reminder that sometimes the best gift you can give a family is a pause.So yes, bring on the holidays. Bring on the end-of-year wind-down. Bring on the blessed, activity-free weeks where the calendar is empty and the car stays parked.It really is the most wonderful time of the year, even if by the end of January we’re desperate for it all to start up again.Saman Shad is an author of two books and a mother of three children.

So what’s the attraction?Thu 18 Dec 2025 08.35 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 12.35 ESTShareGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of theNorthern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of theBritish Museumand taken on roles includingadvising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.But Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has becomethe latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announcedwith a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.The tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.The initiative Osborne is heading up,OpenAIfor Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.Osborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Cleggblazed the trail as head of global affairsfor Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists(€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.1:46'The most disruptive force in history': Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk discuss the future of AI – videoThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year,Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened theAI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.You can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.Either way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.It’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.The more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.Chris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite AppExplore more on these topicsGeorge OsborneOpinionOpenAIChatGPTComputingArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

Richard Pearson is visiting Surrey to close down his late father’s home and settle his affairs and, everywhere he looks, the flag of St George is flying “from suburban gardens and filling stations and branch post offices”. How nice, he thinks, how festive.Soon he learns the truth.So runs the opening not of a recent piece of journalism, but a novel byJG Ballard, Kingdom Come, which despite being almost 20 years old anticipates today’s Britain with eerie precision. In the mid-2000s, Pearson reads up on his new surroundings, only to find the same headlines that assail us in the mid-2020s: “Every day the local newspaper reported attacks on an asylum hotel, the torching of a Bangladeshi takeaway, injuries to a Kosovan youth thrown over the fence into an industrial estate.”The crusader crosses of St George, the hair clay and bloviating of GB News and the live-streaming, selfie-gurning, hate-spewing ofTommy Robinson– their spirit is better captured in this last fiction by the late Ballard than in many more recent and more breathless titles clogging up the annual best-of lists.At the fag-end of 2025, the UK stands possibly only three-and-a-half years away from electing rightwing extremists to power, led by a man among whose sparse credentials for office are that he has never “directly racially abused” anyone. To explain this, analysts and campaigners often reach for stories of Russian money or US networks, or for analogies with German nazism. Such accounts emphasise how unusual and exotic such movements are in Britain, how positivelyforeign. The land that once boasted it couldn’t happen here can now only splutter that at least it didn’t begin here.This is bad history and worse politics. Analogies can never pass for analysis. Nor does studying the rich funders ofNigel Farageor Robinson explain their hoi polloi followers. Fittingly for a writer who titled one of his stories Myths of the Near Future, Ballard observes the country of his time to glimpse the society of our times.Everything in Kingdom Come happens in Brooklands, a suburb that wants to pretend nothing is happening. We are not in some supposedly benighted outpost of the north-east or south Wales, with cheap sentiment about the snaggletoothed “left behind”, but a junction off the M25. Rather than Epping, the centre of lastsummer’s protests against asylum hotels, we’re out west, among the “orbital cities of the plain, as remote as Atlantis and Samarkand to the inhabitants of Chelsea and Holland Park”. Out here are forests of business parks and convention centres, thickets of discount furniture warehouses and cheap takeaways. The great leisure activity is the gleaming giant shopping mall, which boasts “more retail space than the whole of Luton”.Amid this yawning suburbia, Pearson starts to come awake. One evening, he sees an old Volvo up in flames, and an angry mob about to storm a “shabby house”. Inside, he supposes, must be “a released murderer or a paedophile exposed by the local vigilantes”. But no. Out come Muslim women, who have been praying in a makeshift mosque and who must rely on a police line against violence from their own neighbours. As for the white locals, they have taken to wearing red crosses – not for football matches but for an entirely different kind of kickabout, where they set on Asian shopkeepers.It’s a mark of Ballard’s powers of observation that he spotted as far back as the 2000s that it would be to London’s perimeter where ethnic minorities would now be moving. The centre of the capital is not only turning whiter and richer, but the author could see how, a full decade before the Brexit vote, its enemies were defining the place as anti-English: “The West End, Bloomsbury, Notting Hill, Hampstead – they’re heritage London, held together by a dinner-party culture. Here, around the M25, is where it’s really happening. This is today’s England.”Today, politicians, economists and journalists talk of the 2000s in tones of pure elegy. Imagine! One prime minister who spent more than a decade in office. House prices always rising. Flights to third-tier European cities for 99p. Easy credit and ever-cheaper goods coming in from China. Coalmines were turning into call centres, factories were becoming malls and a productive economy was turning to consumption. In the middle of the 2000s, the former mining town of Barnsley began planning to turn itself into aTuscan hill village, ringed by a circle of torch lights.Yet before the decade was out came an almighty crash, from which the UK has never recovered, and even before that living standards for middle- and working-class households were starting to deteriorate. In the middle of the 2000s, the going was good only for those Britons who didn’t look down to see the sands on which their lifestyles were built.Ballard was one of the very few who did look down. In his telling, Brooklands is a bubble land, and the air is already escaping. Its landscape is post-industrial Britain, built on Westminster renewal funds and property developers promising regeneration. Still, shoppers aren’t going to the mall, he notes, they’re starting to trade down. Meanwhile, the town’s top brass think the solution is to clear the mall’s hinterland of migrants, so that it can be expanded. And so they incite race riots.Near the apex of this brand-heavy, unproductive society is a guy who used to act in EastEnders and The Bill and now presents on the mall’s own cable TV channel (which gets better nightly ratings than BBC Two). But David Cruise has his eye on Westminster. As spin doctors and columnists talked about “retail politics”, an actual retailer fancies a crack at parliament. Cruise is defined in terms that could apply to many of those at the top today: “Today’s politics is tailor-made for him. Smiles leaking everywhere, mood music, the sales campaign that gets rid of the need for a product. Even the shiftiness. People like to be conned. It reminds them that everything is a game.”Twenty years after this story was printed, we are just starting to write the history of the strange death of neoliberal England. Yet Kingdom Come demonstrates that our current mess has a long, long history. The bleakness that surrounds today’s politics stretches back to when the sun was out all day long and not a cloud was to be seen.

Almost 200 rapes are recorded every day. And on average,three women are killedby men in the UK every single week. Just pause and consider that.There has been plenty of tough talk on violence against women and girls over the past decade – but too little action. We will deploy the full power of the state in the largest crackdown on violence perpetrated against women and girls in British history. This violence is a national emergency. And as a dad to a daughter, it terrifies me. But as a dad to two sons, it drives home that we can’t keep doing things the same way.So much of this violence is fuelled by the casual misogyny that seeps through our culture, amplified online. Today’s children are growing up in a digital world many parents barely recognise. A place where pornography is easy to access, misogyny spreads fast and loud – and hateful voices tell our boys that control is strength and empathy is weakness.Such figures include Andrew Tate, of whom 41% of young men now say theyhave a positive view. Other studies show that our young men are becomingmore regressive in their attitudesto consent and equality – something that should concern us all.That’s why the prime ministerhas madetackling violence against women and girls a personal priority. And it’s why this government has set a clear, ambitious target: to halve this violence within a decade.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators march against rising violence against women and girls, London, 18 January 2025.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesToday,we launch a new strategyto deliver on that promise. This is a radical approach: a whole-system response that accepts this crisis cannot be fixed by any one institution alone. The strategy focuses on three things: stopping young men being pulled towards harm, stopping abusers and supporting victims.We will crack down on perpetrators with the full force of the state, harnessing better data, smarter policing and specialist teams to identify the most dangerous offenders, disrupt them and pursue them relentlessly.And we are strengthening protection for victims – including through a national expansion ofdomestic abuse protection orders, allowing courts to impose curfews, tagging and exclusion zones on abusers, with tough penalties for breaches. All of this is backed by bold reform of the criminal courts – to deliver the swifter justice that victims deserve.But in truth, this fight starts much earlier than the criminal justice process. If we are serious about culture change – about building a country where women and girls can live free from fear, respected and safe – the battle begins with how we raise our boys.We are making it harder for kids to access harmful, misogynistic content, criminalising strangulation pornography, and putting the onus on tech companies tostop cyberflashingunder the online safety act.But by the time a perpetrator is hauled before the courts, it’s already too late. So prevention sits at the heart of this strategy. We will support schools and parents to teach consent, respect and healthy relationships with confidence. And we will challenge the harmful stereotypes that are often baked in early: that boys shouldn’t cry, that asking for help is weakness, that “real men” hide their feelings.As someone who struggled through his teenage years without a dad, I know how crucial positive male role models are. And we need more men in this conversation – as allies and advocates.So next year, I will bring together a national summit on men and boys – not to lecture, but to listen. To shape a better story about what it means to be a man in Britain today.These measures protect women and girls. But they also protect boys from being drawn into this culture. Because toxic masculinity and violence against women and girls are very much connected. To end one, we must confront the other. I want my daughter to grow up without fear. I want my sons to grow up knowing that masculinity can be kind.This strategy represents the largest crackdown to stop violence against women and girls in British history. It’s a change that belongs to every one of us.David Lammy MP is the deputy prime minister, lord chancellor and secretary of state for justiceDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s where leadership comes inThu 18 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 18 Dec 2025 12.35 ESTShareAs you listen to a Christmas performance of Handel’s Messiah, it is easy to persuade yourself that all is still well with music and the arts in Britain. I again felt the familiar potency of both Messiah and of music more widely in London’s St Martin’s-in-the-Fields on Tuesday this week. When the musicians and singers launched into the fabulously affirmative final chorus, Worthy is the Lamb, towards which Handel and his librettist Charles Jennens have all along been building, the annual ritual poured forth Messiah’s deep sense of shared security and allayed doubt afresh.I’ve been going to Messiah at Christmas for decades now, at one venue or another, and the experience never ceases to lift the spirits in this darkest of seasons. This year, though, more disturbing feelings were also in play. The tender balm of Messiah’s opening lines for the tenor – “Comfort ye, comfort ye my people” – has rarely sounded more necessary and consolatory than it did this week. The austere solemnity of the oratorio’s collective reprimand against “the iniquity of us all” felt very contemporary too, especially at the end of such a dismal, demented and dangerous year.Yet music and the arts are not secure in Britain today. Instead, they are becoming increasingly insecure, as well as more marginal and marginalised. There are lots of different reasons for this process. But there should be absolutely no mistaking that it is happening. It would be dishonest not to admit that the media’s own steady marginalisation of the arts and culture, notably but not only atthe BBC, is one of the important causes.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer playing the flute at a Duke of Edinburgh awards ceremony in 1980.Photograph: Family handout/Labour PartyBritain’s long and stupid psychodrama over so-called cultural elitism certainly doesn’t help. As Someone Else’s Music, the title of Alexandra Wilson’s brilliant new book on Britain’s tragicomic modern agonising about opera, implies, ours is often a society of culturally closed minds. How can an opera ticket costing £100 (and plenty of opera tickets cost less than that) be denounced as elitist when most World Cup tickets are costing thousands of dollars? This country has a pathetic capacity for concentrating on silly partisan squabbles while resolutely ignoring the bigger picture.Educational inequality is fundamental to this. Kids at state schools simply have far less access to the arts than kids in private schools. You can see the results in our often socially top-heavy conservatoires and arts colleges. With a few brilliant exceptions, like Trinity Laban Conservatoire in south-east London (where I was on the board for some years), it’s the expensively educated who get most of the chances, not those from less privileged backgrounds. Labour says it wants arts subjects to becentral to the school curriculum, but until that actually happens and works its way through the system, we will continue to reproduce the widening unfairnesses of today.Not all of the problems of the cultural sectors come down to money. But an awful lot of them do. Whether at the individual, the corporate or the state level, we are simply too mean. Too many rich people do not put anything back (all credit to the few who do, but shame on the rest). Too many companies have minimal sponsorship or charitable budgets (hats off to the exceptions here too). And governments, whether local, devolved or national, are under spending pressures that make it easy to treat culture as an optional extra, which they do.In herhugely welcome and satisfyingly coruscatingreport on the iniquitous work of Arts Council England (ACE) this week, Margaret Hodge reminds us that Britain spends significantly less per head on culture (widely defined) than almost every country in Europe. Greater Berlin alonespends more on culturethan the entire combined arts and culture budgets of ACE and the London mayor. German public funding is under a lot of pressure itself right now, but this is a societal choice, and Britain is making the wrong one.View image in fullscreenEdward Heath with conductor and composer André Previn in 1975.Photograph: David Thorpe/ANL/Rex/ShutterstockThere is something depressing about the fact that, inKeir Starmer, Britain now has its first prime minister with a musical training since Edward Heath more than half a century ago. I am always pleased when Starmer mentions the importance of music or talks to the media about the music he likes. But the time for talk really is over. It’s time for deeds, commitment and results. Time for leadership.The Hodge report offers a blueprint for overdue change. At its heart is the vital recognition that excellence and access should not be pitted against one another as alternatives. If its findings are to be listened to, it ought to mean the application of the lessons of sports funding to arts funding, in which the best and the rest both matter. For Team GB and your local running track, read English NationalOperaand your local playhouse. It also ought to mean a clearout of ACE leadership and a restructuring. But will Starmer’s government embrace it, own it and drive it? The suspicion is that the government, struggling in the polls, will neither care enough nor dare enough.Yet government has a unique responsibility that civil society, however strongly motivated, cannot equal. When the audience stands for the Hallelujah chorus at the end of part two of Messiah, we are not just taking part in a quirky British tradition (audiences in other countries tend to stay seated). We are also making a collective avowal. We are recognising the worth of what we have all inherited, should all cherish, and, echoing the lines that bring Alan Bennett’s The History Boys to its close, should all pass on. That is the government’s duty too. Yes, we must all do our bit, but it is government’s turn now.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCultureOpinionOperaArts Council EnglandArts fundingMargaret HodgeKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

While the Greek wordkrisisrefers to an exceptional moment that disrupts the normal order of things, since 2015 it has become anenduring conditionin contemporary Europe. That year,1 million peoplesought refuge in Europe, fleeing wars and persecution. In the ensuing decade, the issue of migration has been so thoroughly weaponised that one can hardly remember a time when it was not considereda crisis.The idea of a permanent state of emergency does not reflect a reality wherebyEuropegenuinely cannot cope with new arrivals. Rather, it reflects the fact that there are simply too many who profit from manufacturing a sense of crisis.Crisis narratives sustain a political economy of fear, and have driven far-reaching transformations of Europe’s border architecture and migration policy. The European border-industrial complex is booming, with profiteers including the EU border agencyFrontex, whose budget has exploded from€90m in 2014tomore than €1bn this year– despite frequent allegations it is involved inhuman rights violations. (Frontex has denied these allegations.) Across Europe, private defence and security companieshave benefited from lucrative dealsthat have further militarised Europe’s borders.Promising that 2015 will not be repeated, conservative and far-right political forces are on the rise across Europe, seemingly intent on whipping up anti-migrant sentiments and making racist “great replacement” conspiraciesincreasingly mainstream. The racist right have seized their opportunity. But the fact that Europe is an increasingly hostile environment for migrants and racialised minority groups is in large part due to the dangerous cynicism of centrist parties that seek to beat the hard right andfar right at their own game.Germany serves as a paradigmatic case. Exploiting the 2015 “refugee crisis”, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) first entered the German parliament in 2017, announcing that it would “hunt” the parties of the government coalition and “reclaim our land and our people”.We must protect our borders to defend our democracies. Here’s howRead moreAs leader of the opposition and as chancellor since May, the CDU’s Friedrich Merz has steered sharply to the right. Pursuing an aggressive anti-migration agenda and callously playing with sentiments that could be viewed as racist, he ominouslysuggested in Octoberthat Germany’s “problem in the cityscape” could only be resolved through “large-scale deportations”. Back in 2018, Merzpromised to halvethe AfD’s vote share. Several years of pursuing copycat politics has had the opposite effect: the AfD has surged from about5% to 26%, now matching Merz’s CDU in polls.In the UK, the Labour government shares a similar fate. Facing abysmal popularity ratings and massive pressure from the hard-right Reform UK,the government announced“the most sweeping asylum reforms in modern times” in November. Its draconian plans will make refugee status temporary, cut benefits, tear families apart and place many people in a decades-long limbo. This approach does not contain forces on the political right: it emboldens them. While Reform welcomed the announced asylum reform, gleefully wrapping the Labour home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, in itsown colours on social media, the jubilant far-right activist Tommy Robinsoncelebratedwhat he referred to as theobliteration of the Overton window.For the hard right orfar right all over Europe, the “gift” of migration crises and panics keeps giving. Though this should be clear to all by now, it deserves reiteration: when you engage in a politics of cruelty to outbid those whose entire political agenda appears founded on cruelty, defeat is inevitable. Even if governments succeed in implementing “tough” migration policies, or bring the number of asylum seekers down, the far right will find other racial minorities to target, scapegoat and dehumanise.None of this has quenched the far right’s desire for more anti-migrant cruelty and violence. Turning vast geographies such as theSaharaand theMediterranean Seainto death zones is not enough for those who see their fight as a civilisational one, steeped in racial mythology and “remigration” fantasies that will ultimately also turn against Europe’s minority citizens.The ideas of thefar right are gathering in strength, creating alliances across the world and leading to migration being usedas a vehicle for authoritarian transformation. In its recentnational security strategy, Donald Trump’s administration called for an end to the “era of mass migration” andlaid out plansof “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory” in order to prevent Europe’s “civilizational erasure”. In Germany, the AfD isalready celebrating.What, then, does the next decade hold for fortress Europe? The EU’s chosen path seems clear. With thepact on migration and asylumcoming into full force in 2026, yet another milestone in Europe’s fortification will be reached. Instead of countering the narratives around perpetual migration crisis, the pact turns crisis into policy. It will enable EU member states to accelerate border procedures, extend enforced detention and limit asylum rights when faced with “an exceptional situation of mass influx of third-country nationals”. Yet,according to Amnesty International, the “situations” covered “are so broad, vaguely defined, and overlapping that they are likely to apply regularly. Once in place, it may prove challenging to unwind these exceptions, leading to a normalisation of emergency provisions in Europe.”In a world with many reasons for forced human mobility– wars and genocides, capitalist exploitation and climate breakdown – ramped-up border security, deportations and a generalised politics of cruelty will never “solve” the issue of migration. What they will achieve is the erosion of democratic norms, the deepening of social divides and the amplification of racist hostility.Since migration has become the cornerstone of the current authoritarian turn, it is precisely around migration that resistance needs to form. How we will look back on the decade 2026-35 is ultimately up to us. Carrying out rescues in the Mediterranean, disrupting immigration raids and deportation flights, reclaiming cities as spaces of plurality and solidarity – all these are urgently needed interventions that defend our fellow human beings, and take the fight to the authoritarian forces that are growing all around us.Dr Maurice Stierl is a migration and border researcher at the University of Osnabrück, GermanyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She talks about juggling TV work with single motherhood, losing her husband, and why she’d rather have specialised in actingThu 18 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTShareJanet Ellis is exactly as you might remember her from her days as aBlue Peterpresenter: elfin movements, lively eyes, a penetrating aspect that could smell bullshit a mile away but would never be so discourteous as to mention it. She lives in London with her 21-year-old grandson and a gentle Italian spinone called Angela, who follows her everywhere. The dog is a surprise, being the size of a horse. It adds an element of slightly fairytale jeopardy to the scene, as you watch them pad down the stairs and think, “What happens the day Angela decides to go a bit faster?”Ellis, 70, will become the next president of Humanists UK at the start of 2026, taking over from the geneticist and broadcasterAdam Rutherford. She supports the group’s campaigns – for secular schools and assisted dying laws. More broadly, she says she has “always been struck” by its “steady calmness” – a port of irreligious decency in stormy times. “Since I was a child, I’ve found the idea of prioritising what came next over this bit a really weird concept. Everything starts and finishes in our minds.”View image in fullscreenEllis: ‘I’ve never been scared of saying what I think.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIt’s a tough time to be taking on the role, with politics increasingly polarised and US battles imported to the UK byevangelical Christian billionaire money. To be on the frontlines arguing for access to abortion, for instance, is now more exposing. “I’ve never been scared of saying what I think,” she says briskly. “The reassuring thing is, as you get older, it gets easier.” Just because you made your name as a children’s TV presenter, with an endless supply of sticky-backed plastic and things you made earlier, does not mean you’re without edge.Ellis was born in 1955 in Kent. Her father served in the army until she was 14, after which he joined a model-making company. She left school at 17 to go to what was then the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, and landed her first job three weeks after graduating – a small theatre part in which she spent most of her time on stage as a plant pot.Her dream was to make it as a theatre actor. “Telly in those days was a bit, ‘Well, if I have to,’” she says. At 22, she got a part appearing in four episodes of Doctor Who, shortly after started work as a presenter on the children’s show Jigsaw and then, at 23, became pregnant with the eldest of her three children,Sophie Ellis-Bextor.Having a baby was quite an unusual move for a young creative in a hurry, given that feminism’s second wave was well-advanced by the late 70s. “I think I just thought, ‘That looks easy,’” she says. Motherhood was, but staying married wasn’t. When she was 29, Sophie was four, and Ellis had just arrived on Blue Peter, she got divorced. It would have been career-ending had there been any publicity around it, “But I wasn’t in the age of X and Insta and paparazzi,” she says. “I established myself quite early on in my mind as somebody who was free to be.View image in fullscreen‘I think I just thought, “That looks easy”’ … Ellis on having her first child (Sophie Ellis-Bextor, above, left).Photograph: Clive Limpkin/Daily Mail/Rex/Shutterstock“Obviously, what I initially did to become well-known was a programme that had its own reputation that was pretty clean-living, pretty upright, pretty nice, but that was fine. I knew what I was outside. It’s like your kid at home is not necessarily the same as your kid at school. I could always divide the two.”View image in fullscreenReceiving her MBE, with her daugher Sophie, at Buckingham Palace in 2016.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesEvery moment of those Blue Peter years (1983 to 1987) seared itself into the consciousness of my generation – the pets, the Blue Peter garden, the badges, the craft projects. You never would have guessed that Elllis had never set out to be a TV presenter. In fact, she says, “When my agent first said, ‘What about presenting?’, I found it absolutely, outrageously awful as a suggestion, because obviously [she gestures with both arms in the opposite direction] the Royal Shakespeare Company is that way.” At the same time, she was a single parent: “If you’d been set it as a task at the outset – you’re going to have to get divorced, with a high-profile part in a squeaky clean children’s programme, you’d think, ‘That is going to be really hard’. But I just had to do it. My main thought was, I hoped I would meet somebody else, and I hoped it would be ok with a kid.”She met John Leach, a television producer, in her third year at Blue Peter – he was a friend of a friend. They got mad drunk on a night she was supposed to memorise her script, she managed it anyway, then called him and asked him out to the cinema. He played hard to get and said he’d seen everything that was out. “We ended up having to go to Aliens,” she says. She could do any night except Wednesday, because that was her other script evening, and that was the only night he could do. Still, they married in 1988, had two children – Jack and Martha – and were a fabled happy couple. Why he played so hard to get is lost to history.View image in fullscreenEllis at home with Angela.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianWhen Ellis left Blue Peter in 1989, there were rumours that she was fired because she was pregnant with her son, but that wasn’t it. “It was just the thought of trying to do it with a baby,” she says. “And when I said I wasn’t going to come back after having him, nobody went ‘Ohplease’.I wasn’t sacked, I effectively sacked myself.”After Martha was born, three years later, she presented the BBC magazine-format Open Air, and wrote a non-fiction book, How to Get Married without Divorcing Your Family, with fellow Blue Peter presenter Caron Keating.Leach died in 2020, when he was 63, two and a half years since he’d been diagnosed with tonsil cancer. “He was extraordinary,” she says. “The funniest person I’ve ever met. A brilliant stepfather to Soph; he took it on without examining it at all, and he was really close to her. She came on honeymoon with us. He was solid and smart and he never made a single enemy or anything like it, either professionally or privately, in his life.” He was a quiet man, and when they used to go out, he’d come home saying, “Do you think I said enough?”“It was ridiculous that he should die so young,” she says. It was an absolutely brutal time to have terminal cancer, right in the middle of the pandemic, when it was too dangerous to go into hospital. “Then a bit further along, there was no room at the inn – they were prioritising Covid. I have absolutely no idea, and to me it’s not worth examining, what would have happened with his treatment if the pandemic hadn’t happened, because it did. It’s funny, isn’t it. I never thought I’d be able to talk about it without crying, but here we are.” It’s terribly poignant to hear her talk about John. Even Angela the dog looks like she is about to start crying. With rueful determination, as if Ellis is on a director’s command to lighten the atmosphere, she says, “the godsend was, we had fantastic weather. We sat in the garden for months. And all we ever wanted, really, was to be together.”View image in fullscreenPresenters Simon Groom (with Goldie), Janet Ellis (with Jack) and Peter Duncan (with George) in the Blue Peter garden.Photograph: BBC Pictures ArchivesShe regrets that John didn’t live to see how Covid ended. “I felt really cheated for him.” And, that they had to hold his funeral with restrictions still in place. “We could have 15 people – and, you know, Soph’s got five kids, that pretty much did it.”It was during this period that Ellis-Bextor was the soundtrack-cum-mascot of the pandemic, broadcastingKitchen Discofrom her home 10 minutes away from Ellis’s, complete with glitterball and platform heels and kids of all ages (her youngest was tiny then – he’s now six), mucking in. It wasn’t a secret that John was dying, and Ellis makes no secret now of her profound grief, but the entire family takes this responsibility to keep cheerful incredibly seriously.Losing her husband is the only thing that’s ever wobbled Janet Ellis’s agnosticism. “If anything was going to challenge it, it would be the hope that you’d see someone again. But I’m not going to see him again … I genuinely find it comforting that we had a good timehere. I’m not waiting for another bit.”When she accepted the role at Humanists UK, she said to Andrew Copson, the chief executive, “‘Oh God, have I got to stop saying ‘Oh God?’” And he said, ‘No, it’s fine. Just try not to.’” It’s hard to imagine anyone who wouldn’t forgive it.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBlue PeterSophie Ellis-BextorChildren's TVAtheismReligioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

As the singer and guitarist of Au Pairs, the Birmingham post-punk four-piece, she recalls “guys being aggressive purely because you were a woman on stage”. At one show, the band were on the bill with UB40 and the Angelic Upstarts, only the latter didn’t turn up. “So the audience, who were 95% skinheads, were gobbing at us and throwing anything they could get their hands on – which included a bin.” Was she scared? “No, I was bolshie back then. I just went to the front of the stage and said: ‘You missed.’”After the band split in 1983, Woods hoped her days of dealing with overt misogyny were behind her. But then she retrained and became a lawyer. “When I came to the bar [in the 1990s], women couldn’t even wear trousers. I used to get men saying: ‘What colour knickers are you wearing today, Lesley?’ It’s better now, but back then law was way worse than music in how it treated women.”Woods – who is now 67 – still works as a barrister, specialising in immigration law, though in the last 15 years she has dipped her toes back into music, performing occasional solo gigs and self-releasing an EP, In the Fade, in early 2025. Next month, she returns to the stage for a UK tour as Au Pairs. Led by Woods, the band now has new members: Estella Adeyeri of the Black feminist punk band Big Joanie, and the Thurston Moore Group’s Jem Doulton and Alex Ward. “They are all a lot younger than me, but then most people are,” she says with a dry laugh.I meet Woods over tea and biscuits at her home in east London where she lives with her small dog, Dusky. Woods is hilariously unfiltered: pithy pronouncements about former associates, both in law and the music industry, are invariably followed by a more cautious, “You should probably leave that out, or I’ll get into trouble.” Woods is currently deep into Au Pairs rehearsals and loving every minute of it. “The band know the old songs but we’re working on new stuff, too. I’m hoping we can make an album.” But not everyone is so thrilled with the Au Pairs reboot. When they split, the band – who, alongside Woods, comprised bassist Jane Munro, guitarist Paul Foad and drummer Pete Hammond – were not on good terms. Though there has been sporadic email contact, Woods says they haven’t been in the same room for more than 40 years.It was a promoter who originally approached Woods about a tour. He hoped the original band might reunite but when Woods demurred, saying the others wouldn’t be keen, he suggested hiring new musicians. Woods says she contacted the ex-members out of courtesy. “I said to them: ‘I am reforming Au Pairs. Are you interested?’ They responded as I imagined and said no.” Woods didn’t tell them a tour was on the table, as she wanted to “sound them out first. It’s no good going on a tour if you can’t get on.”It’s upsetting that something that started off with such great ideals and in a happy state of mind has disintegrated to this pointAfter they declined to be involved, Woods trademarked the band name and set about finding new musicians. When the tour was announced, the ex-members sent out a press release making clear their displeasure. In a joint statement to the Guardian, Munro, Foad and Hammond say that Woods had asked them if they were interested in reforming, “but it didn’t feel like a genuine or friendly offer and we responded individually, declining for different reasons. Days later we discovered she’d trademarked the band name behind our backs.We asked her to make clear this was her project and distinct from the Au Pairs – unfortunately the tour was advertised with the cover of our first album, which misled people into thinking it was the original lineup … The tour should not be going out under the Au Pairs name with only one original member involved.” They challenged any suggestion that Woods was the driving force. “We were ALL the driving force and have fought to keep the band’s music in the public domain.”Woods acknowledges the tour was initially advertised on a third-party website using a picture of the original lineup, but says that she requested the picture be taken down.She says that, for the ex-members, it’s a case of “we don’t want to do it, but we don’t want you to do it”. She adds that it’s “extremely upsetting that something that started off with such great ideals and in a happy state of mind has disintegrated to this point”.View image in fullscreenCome again … Woods (second right) and her new-look Au Pairs.Photograph: Polly HancockThe Au Pairs formed in 1978 after a chance meeting between Woods and Foad at a bus stop in Birmingham; the pair began dating and set about assembling a band, though the relationship ended before the first Au Pairs album came out. Woods was studying philosophy and French at Birmingham University at the time but dropped out and transferred to Keele in Staffordshire which “was a hotbed of leftwing politics and feminism”. Woods funnelled what she was learning about gender politics into songs that were furious, funny and defiantly explicit.Au Pairs’ debut LP, 1981’s Playing With a Different Sex, proved a thrilling showcase for their jagged guitar-based rock and declamatory songwriting. Tracks included We’re So Cool, which examined open relationships – “I don’t mind if you want to bring somebody home” – and Come Again, which depicted a woman providing tongue-in-cheek commentary as a man tries to bring her to orgasm: “Is your finger aching? I can feel you hesitating.”For Woods, the lyrics were “the antithesis to the boy-meets-girl, drippy falling-in-love stuff”. Was she worried how people would react? “Not at all. Though I do remember Paul’s mum saying: ‘You shouldn’t sing about that, that’s private.’ But I guess you’re brave when you’re young.” Elsewhere, the song It’s Obvious fantasised about a time when gender roles ceased to matter, while Headache for Michelle, about being too strung out on drugs to protest society’s ills, was inspired by Woods’ first girlfriend who “was a bit of a drug fiend”. Woods says her own drug of choice was speed, “partly because I had a terrible complex about being fat and the one thing speed did was stop me eating”.When you’re starting out, it’s wonderful, like being at the start of a passionate affair. Unfortunately it doesn’t always lastKathleen Hanna has cited Au Pairs as an influence on her band Bikini Kill and the wider riot grrrl movement, and Kurt Cobain was said to have been a fan. Critics were also full of praise. Hailing them alongside the Raincoats and the Slits, Lester Bangs wrote that “the absolute best rock’n’roll anywhere today is being played by women: last night I saw God in the form of the Au Pairs” while the venerable Greil Marcus wrote a paean to them in his book In the Fascist Bathroom. Along with the provocative lyrical content, Woods’ sexuality became a talking point in interviews. Though she identifies as bisexual, back then it was easier to tell journalists that she was a lesbian, despite knowing it could harm her career. “Any number of male artists were in the closet back then, for good reason. But I guess being in a band, and being around people who are endorsing you, your values and politics, puts you in a kind of bubble.”Despite the current fractious relations between Woods and her ex-bandmates, the singer still looks back with pride and affection at the early days, when they were a gang of friends touring the country and having a blast. “If you look at the early photos, we all look very happy. When you’re starting out, it’s wonderful. It’s like being at the start of a passionate affair. You’re so happy and you’re in love with each other and everyone else. Your passion for the music and the chemistry, it’s all there. But unfortunately it doesn’t always last.”Supporting the Jam, sausages with the Bay City Rollers and defying skinheads: post-punk girl group Dolly Mixture look backRead moreThings began to sour with their second album, 1982’s Sense and Sensuality, which saw Au Pairs embracing a more eclectic and rhythmic sound. Woods says the band “lost our sense of musical direction and the new material wasn’t worked through enough. But we were up against it financially, and we had to get in the studio.” At the same time, she was losing her voice as she had been “slaughtering it” during live shows trying to make herself heard over shonky PA systems. Woods was also in a volatile relationship, the details of which she’d rather not get into, but which was “very traumatising. I don’t think I’d been open with anyone about that because I’d probably felt ashamed or embarrassed.”After playing more than 200 shows in the space of a year, Au Pairs were exhausted and stopped communicating with one another. Then their record label went bankrupt. Munro was the first to leave the band. Woods says that Au Pairs were subsequently offered a new contract with another label and a chance to record with the producer Steve Lillywhite, but she met with Foad and Hammond to discuss it and they said they’d had enough. “So that was it. That was the end.”With the band over, Woods left Birmingham and moved back in with her parents in Stevenage. A desire for a fresh start led to her enrolling to do a law degree. “I thought: ‘What can I do that’s really difficult that will help me get my head together?’” The training lasted five years. “I never thought I’d pass the exams. When I got the results, I’d gone to Paris and my mum phoned and said, ‘You’ve passed’. I was, like: ‘Oh no. I’ll have to carry on now.”Woods has now worked as a lawyer for 35 years. In that time, she has always intended to return to making and performing music. Now feels like the right time to restart Au Pairs, she says. “At my age, it’s not like the future is stretched out in front of you. Time isn’t on my side, and I think I can make a good album. I wouldn’t want to leave this world without having tried. I don’t think I’ve given the best of me yet.”Au Pairs tour from January, first with the Skids and later with Gina Birchandthe Unreasonables.Explore more on these topicsPunkPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Less remembered today is a darkly brilliant European film about a stage actor in Nazi Germany that went home from the ceremony with the best international feature prize. Mephisto, directed by István Szabó, was the first ever Hungarian film to do so.“The moment took me by surprise,” remembers Szabó, 87, four decades later. “I didn’t expect it.” Visibly elated on the live broadcast as he took to the stage, Szabó today says that he “knew this award wasn’t just mine, but also Brandauer’s”, meaning the film’s electrifying lead actor, and the largely Hungarian crew “who contributed with their talent to the making of the film”.Though 1981’s Mephisto was a landmark film in Hungarian cinema, it has largely disappeared. A DVD run in the early 2000s fell out of print, and the film has generally been overlooked by the major streaming platforms. This December, Second Run – in collaboration with the National Film InstituteHungary– have restored and rereleased Szabó’s masterpiece, along with its follow-ups Colonel Redl, an epic about a gay officer in the Austro-Hungarian empire, and Hanussen, a Nazi-era occult drama also featuring Klaus Maria Brandauer.View image in fullscreen‘An actor wants to assert his talent at all costs’ … Klaus Maria Brandauer as Hendrik Höfgen in Mephisto, 1981.Photograph: Analysis/AllstarMephisto tells the story of Hendrik Höfgen. An ambitious stage actor as the Nazis come to power in Germany, Höfgen cuts himself off from his roots in the leftist theatre scene to ingratiate himself with the fascist regime. “Höfgen is a very talented actor who wants to assert his talent at all costs,” says Szabó. “To stand in the middle of the stage, in the spotlight.” Friends and colleagues are arrested, killed, exiled. But Höfgen only digs in deeper with the Nazis, who make him head of the Berlin state theatre.All of this is told through the extraordinary central performance of Brandauer, the Austrian actor (later director) depicting all of Höfgen’s frustrated ambition, wilful ignorance and fatal capacity for seduction in a performance as vivid and shocking as any in cinema history. Today, Szabó pays tribute to the “particularly talented actor” with whom he collaborated most recently in 2020’s Final Report. “It was crucial for me, for us, to decide what to show in close up from Brandauer’s secrets. What he reveals and what he conceals.”Mephisto is based on the real life story of Gustaf Gründgens, whose career soared when the Nazis ploughed subsidies into the stage to shape it in their own image. In 1936, Gründgens’ former lover Klaus Mann wrote a scathing, thinly veiled novel about the actor, later subject to a landmark 1960s libel case that resulted in the book being banned (on paper, the ban still applies today, though the book is widely published). Gründgens died in 1963 having never publicly expressed remorse for his Nazi affiliations. But in Szabó’s hands, Mephistobecomes a universal work of art: specific and cliche-free about the politics of 1930s Germany, but also a wider Faustian fable about man’s opportunistic complicity with evil.With authoritarianism on the rise across the globe, does Mephisto hold lessons for the 21st century? “The desire for self-assertion is a human trait that can create many positive values,” says the director. “The problem arises when it is used for the sake of a wrong ideology or policy, and a talented person allows themselves to be exploited, or even fights in support of those in power. This still exists in the 21st century, and it does not necessarily require a dictatorship. The power of business is enough. Or some other motive.” Szabó rebuffs a question about 2026’s Hungarian parliamentary elections, thought to be the tightest for Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party in his 15 year tenure (“of course I’m interested, like everybody else”).View image in fullscreen‘History marches relentlessly through central Europe’ … István Szabó.Photograph: Reynaud Julien/APS-Medias/ABACA/ShutterstockThis year has seen an increased focus on Hungarian art, with László Krasznahorkai being awarded this year’s Nobel prize in Literature anda Booker win for Hungarian-British novelist David Szalay. Szabó says that he considers himself a Hungarian director, “but it is important to emphasise central European existence in this context. History marches relentlessly through central Europe.” In Szabó’s work, this has meant depicting the close of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the Holocaust (Szabó has explored his wartime Jewish upbringing in Budapest in films such as Sunshine and early work Father) and Hungary’s communist dictatorship (in 2006,he admitted having informed to the secret police, which he said was part of an effort to save the life of a classmate).Szabó is as pessimistic about cinema as directors in their 80s tend to be, but praises Barnabás Tóth’s 2019 film Those Who Remained, a lyrical film about life after the Holocaust, and Bálint Szimler’s controversial Fekete Pont (Lesson Learned), a broadside against Hungary’s state education system. So far, the only other Hungarian film to match Mephisto’s Oscar winning achievement is 2015’s Son of Saul.Is Szabó’s own future in cinema any more certain? “I can’t say whether I’ll have a chance to make another film,” says the director, who cites the “quite serious physical work” of directing as his main obstacle. “You have to go up to a lot of people to talk to them, because you can’t shout over other people’s heads.”Mephisto, Colonel Redl and Hanussenare released as a Blu-ray limited edition box setExplore more on these topicsFilmHungaryEuropeNazisminterviewsShareReuse this content"

Prepare to gorge yourself silly on it over the holidays along with the mince pies. You know you want to …Hannah J DaviesThu 18 Dec 2025 03.01 ESTShare‘Turn off your brain and jump!” So says London geezer Alfie (Lucien Laviscount) to ex-girlfriend Emily’s best pal Mindy (Ashley Park), as they flirt their way through a racy dance scene. It could, of course, be an instruction to viewers of season five ofEmily in Paris, too. Once pilloried for its Anglophile tendencies and surface-level commitment tola culture française, the fluffy dramedy about an American in Paris helmed by Lily Collins has – over the past five years – become one of TV’s greatest guilty pleasures: a fancy fever dream of great clothes, strapping love interests and a constant karaoke soundtrack courtesy of Park, a Broadway star whose contract clearly dictates that she sing at least five times per episode. The clothes are less outlandish this time around, but still aspirational – lending the show a strand of Sex and the City DNA (they also share a creator, Darren Star).But, unlike SATC – whose spinoff And Just Like That devolved into a mindless mess – Emily in Paris is free of any baggage, and at liberty to be as silly as it fancies. Much of season five doesn’t even take place in Paris, as our leading lady continues to mix business and pleasure in Rome with cashmere heir Marcello (Eugenio Franceschini). “Ciaoandni hao!” says Mindy, who has rejected a job as a judge on Chinese Popstar (“I’d rather be judging people in real life than on TV”) and is now headed to Italy, just in time to help Emily and her crack marketing team with some #sponsoredcontent (read: singing inside a giant martini glass). Also in town is Alfie: cue an inadvisable fling between the two that instantly breaks all the rules of girl code.Michelin-starred chef Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) is back, too, and you won’t need much French to understand his instant regret in following Emily to Rome:“Je pense que c’était une très, très mauvaise idée.”Not that she even knows that he’s there: she’s too busy truffle-hunting in deeply impractical heels, while Marcello’s sisters make snide remarks about her in Italian. At least Emily’s still a force to be reckoned with in the marketing world. At one point, she has the incredible idea of rubbing hamburger meat all over her hands to attract the attention of a dog, whose owner, in turn, is a high-powered fashion designer.Brava!View image in fullscreenSpacey socialite … Minnie Driver as Princess Jane in Emily in Paris.Photograph: Giulia Parmigiani/Netflix © 2025There are many, many new faces, the best among them being Minnie Driver as a spacey socialite, Princess Jane, who knows everybody “from Fiat to Fendi”. She is sure she can bag Agence Grateau’s Rome office some high-profile clients (for a fee). Driver laps up the campiness of the whole thing, savouring lines like, “You picked the right city for an affair … have fun on Saturday night, confess Sunday!” Her character also serves an important purpose in Emily’s fourth-wall-shattering world: as we learn of her financial woes, she becomes the conduit for a plethora of product placement, including – but not limited to – delivering a Peroni commercial at a party.There is also – perhaps surprisingly – more emotional heft to this series than previous outings, and the sense that Emily and friends are growing up. Collins became a mother in real life earlier this year, and while Emily isn’t thinking about children, there’s definitely more maturity to the character, who looks back wistfully on her early days in Paris (her“belle époque”, she says); takes offence at a work pitch poking fun at her many exes; and wonders what the future holds for her medium-distance relationship. There’s also a (slightly strained) extended metaphor about a fake handbag, and how real things with Marcello truly are. Emily’s boss and nouvelle vague-ish heroine Sylvie (the ever-excellent Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu) reconnects with some new men and with an old friend, while Emily considers – perhaps for the first time – that she and Mindy might not be BFFs any more.View image in fullscreenUh-oh, trouble ahead … Emily and Mindy (Ashley Park) in Emily in Paris.Photograph: Giulia Parmigiani/NetflixBefore things can get too heavy, though, the series steers us back towards the absurd and the outrageous, including a twist with Sylvie’s new love interest which – predictable as it is – is very fun. Bruno Gouery gets loads of brilliant, waggish lines, too, as Emily’s colleague Luc. I only hoped we’d see more of fellow Agence GrateauconfrèreJulien (Samuel Arnold), as he masterminds a campaign to rebrand a homophobic water brand.Still, Emily in Paris (and Rome) remains a total hoot, and the sort of thing you’ll surely want to gorge on over the holidays alongside the mince pies.

Holed up in New York, writing and recording the follow-up to 2023’sCrazymad, for Me– which, despite critical acclaim and a Mercury nomination, was pronounced unsatisfactory by the singer herself – Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson suffered what sounds like a pretty terrifying breakdown. “I started actually hallucinating,” she said earlier this year. “I didn’t realise for the first two months that was what was happening, but I basically imagined the entire apartment I was staying in was crawling with insects … I went to the doctor and showed him my bites, and he said: ‘Those are stress hives; you’re mental.’”View image in fullscreenArtwork for Euro-Country.Photograph: CMATBaby/AWAL/PAOne assumes that wasn’texactlywhat he said, but you get the gist. And yet, despite its author comparing its recording to “a toxic relationship”, Euro-Country does not sound like it was challenging to make. On the contrary: it sounds like the supremely assured work of a songwriter whose powers have reached a new peak. It is, by turns, poignant, moving, furiously angry, uproariously funny and packed with incredible tunes. It strides confidently away from the country-infused style she minted on her 2022 debutIf My Wife New I’d Be Dead, into territory that touches on jazz (Janis Joplining), raging alt-rock (The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station) and soul-kissed pop (Running/ Planning; Take a Sexy Picture of Me) without losing the essence of what made her successful in the first place.Listen to her break the fourth wall during The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station, with a cry of “this is making no sense to the average listener”; pause her description of a collapsing relationship on When a Good Man Cries to castigate herself for being “the people’s mess, the Dunboyne Diana”; or deliver an opening as wait-what?as that of Lord, Let That Tesla Crash (“I heard death comes in threes / I misheard it, being from Dublin / I thought ‘death’s in the trees’ / Which makes sense because they’re the saddest cunts of plants”). Again and again, you’re struck by the sense that this could be the work of no one else.Before its release, Thompson expressed concern that the album’s socio-political bent would be read as “incredibly cringe and incredibly earnest”, but she needn’t have worried. A masterclass in addressing serious topics with a light, witty touch, and in allying her lyrics to hook-laden, undeniable melodies, Euro-Country addressed body-shaming, mental health, Irish identity and the iniquities of late-stage capitalism (“All the mooching around shops,” as she put it, “and the lack of identity”) without ever causing the listener to feel they were being lectured.CMAT, pop’s gobbiest, gaudiest star: ‘Everyone else in music needs a kick up the hole!’Read moreIt managed to interrogate the human cost of the 2008 financial crisis in Ireland – on a title track that featured references to mythical Irish warrior Cú Chulainn and Kerry Katonain the same line– and provoke a viralTikTok dance craze, promoted by Chicken Shop Date’s Amelia Dimoldenberg and actor Julia Fox, among others: by any metric, quite an achievement. It also informed a showstopping Glastonbury performance that felt like an infectious explosion of faintly chaotic joy.Thompson has described Euro-Country as “the most important album I’ve made”, and as the end of something: “breaking up with an old version of myself”. Understandably, she doesn’t “want to make another record where I’m self-flagellating for three months in a fucking weird apartment in New York and there’s imaginary insects crawling everywhere”. In that interview, she wondered aloud whether songwriting was a sustainable occupation for her; whether seeking treatment for her mental health might cause the flow of songs to stop. Whatever the future holds forCMAT, Euro-Country is a high-water mark in her career, and in pop music in 2025. It’s the triumphant work of an artist who seems out there on her own, completely inimitable: proof of the power of forging your own unique identity in a climate where the cookie-cutter too often prevails.Explore more on these topicsMusicBest music of 2025CMATIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s very exposing and raw – though you pay a price’: Addison Rae, the Guardian’s artist of the yearIn just two years, Rae has gone from star TikTok dancer to being Grammy-nominated for best new artist. She reflects on her critically acclaimed debut and how she’s learning to reclaim and relinquish controlLaura SnapesThu 18 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTShareNo one in pop has had a year likeAddison Rae. She may not be the biggest star – that remains Taylor Swift – or even the most commercially successful breakout act. But the dreamy dance-pop haze of her debut album, Addison, made her into an artist’s artist, loved by the likes of Charli xcx and Lana Del Rey – the leftfield pop acts who paved the way for someone like her. Like a pre-Brat Charli, or perhaps Sky Ferreira, the 25-year-old is the pop connoisseur’s choice, justly earning comparisons to Del Rey, her fellow Louisiana girl Britney Spears and Ray of Light-era Madonna, while knowing her way around her R&B and Jersey club. She’s up for best new artist at next year’s Grammy awards – and with Addison and its knowingly anaesthetised single Headphones On placing in the Guardian’s top five albums and tracks of 2025 respectively, she’s our artist of the year.So it’s crazy to flick back just two years to when Rae wasn’t just a flop, but a punchline. In 2023, she released her debut single Obsessed, a perfectly average Benny Blanco-produced single that attracted disproportionate hatred because Rae was then just a TikTok star whose breezy dance videos had made her the platform’s fifth most-followed figure. The song flopped. Five months later came the AR EP: featuring a Charli guest verse – she asked to feature on a leaked demo that she loved – it made Rae a cult favourite. Last summer, she returned the favour, guesting on a remix of Charli’s Von Dutch: “While you’re sitting in your dad’s basement … Got a lot to say about my debut!” Rae taunted.Now, she says, she’s relieved Obsessed didn’t work out. “I wasn’t ready to stand in front of people and say what I say as concisely and straightforwardly as I am now. I’ve grown up so much in the past few years. Life happens to you at such a quick rate once you start realising how in the driver’s seat you actually are.”View image in fullscreenAddison Rae performing New York, 3 October 2025.Photograph: Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty ImagesShe also has a compelling theory about why it took her a while to get here: earlier this year, she smartly posited that “taste is a luxury” – that when you’re trying to escape your circumstances, as the Lafayette girl born Addison Rae Easterling was, you’ll do whatever it takes to get out, rather than wait around for people to understand your truest self. (A playlist she made in 2021 featured tATu, the Cars and Sophie.) Hence dancing “in a way that the most people possible could understand” – the hypnotic, semaphore-like portrait mode style that TikTok made indelible. As soon as she got a talent manager, she asked to train in songwriting and acting. “I used social media as a way to get more stability, to have the opportunity to actually pursue the things that I want,” she says.Released in June, Addison tracks the velocity of her six-year rise from dropout journalism student to first-gen TikTok superstar and mononymous icon: “My life moves faster than me / Can’t feel the ground beneath my feet,” she gasps on the trancey Times Like These. That speed has only intensified: it’s early December and Rae is calling from her Los Angeles home. She’s sometimes endearingly garrulous, but also sits in the Venn crossover where southern charm meets expensive media training. Her publicist and two managers are on mute, and she keeps her camera off. “I just look a little insane,” she says. “I’m so discombobulated. I got back from Sweden a day and a half ago and I’m just like, wrecked. I got my hair done – oh my gosh, my roots – then I had the Variety thing and a shoot.”The “Variety thing” was the magazine’s annual Hitmakers Brunch, where Rae and her producers and co-writers, Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser of Max Martin’s Stockholm-based MXM stable, received the Future is Female award. Having three women in charge of a major-label pop album is basically unprecedented:a 2025 reportfound that a pitiful 5.9% of production credits belonged to women, down from 6.5% in 2023. “Luka and Elvira are two of the most incredibly talented women, in their 20s, in a space full of men,” Rae says. “As much as they’ve told me they feel like I took a chance on them, I feel like they took a chance on me. I can’t believe we made the album with just the three of us in a room. I try to downplay it, because I never want to force that idea into people’s faces. But I really feel like it is something so special.”View image in fullscreenLuka Kloser and Addison Rae onstage at the Variety Hitmakers Brunch, 6 December 2025.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesThey wrote last year’s breakout single Diet Pepsi – think falsetto Lana, synths hissing like hot springs – the first day they met. Traditionally, aspiring female stars have been shoved in writing rooms filled with strangers. Writing the song, says Rae, “would never have happened had it not felt like such an accepting and safe space. That sometimes can’t be achieved when there’s an influx of people in the room that you don’t know, or maybe feel intimidated by or uncomfortable with.”Famously, Rae went into her first meeting with Columbia Records with a folder containing her vision for her debut album – and not a note of music. You must be good at selling yourself, I tell her, and she laughs. She’s flicking through the folder as we speak, and says its contents ended up being “shockingly present” on the album. “I had photos of myself when I was little in pageants; one of me as a little girl of one year old, but I have a crown on. I always want to go back to this childlike inspiration and fulfil those dreams and goals and ideas.”Recent pop lyrics have been heavily laden with lore and thinly veiled swipes at rivals, making the direct writing on Addison unusually refreshing. Rae sings of luxury, pleasure, fashion and fame keeping sadness at bay. You might call it superficial, but her unapologetic mindset reflects how many people her age feel when short-term highs can mollify a dire lack of long-term security. She also knows how voyeuristically appealing glamour is: “You got a front row seat and I / I got a taste of the glamorous life,” she sings on Fame Is a Gun.“I am a very protective person when it comes to my life, and I don’t like it when people take things out of context,” she says of her straightforward style. “I want to write in a way that is direct and honest and clear, and leaves little room for misinterpretation, because I just don’t believe that my story or the things I want to say deserve to be treated that way.”Addison Rae: Diet Pepsi – videoI read her something that the Washington Post wrote when they named Addison album of the year: “Why does this woman sound so alone?” “That is so interesting, I actually want to see that,” she says, typing in the newspaper’s URL before being surprised to hit the paywall: “I thought I was totally paying for that!” She gets why listeners would interpret it that way. “The album was [from] a very lonely perspective. I wanted to say it on my own and to communicate in a way that felt like I was speaking for myself. Life is lonely, and there’s something really powerful about taking that into your own hands.” That’s one of the most captivating aspects of the record, I suggest: the steeliness of her self-reliant perspective versus the enveloping softness of its sound. “That means a lot,” she says. “I am an introspective person and I love to look inside and understand why I feel the way I do. I think that is being alone in a very beautiful way, in a way that honours the stories I want to tell and the way I want to tell them.”It’s immediately clear when you get Addison on something she’s less keen to share. She’s fairly guarded when I ask about whether being a sexual person, as she recently described herself, was challenging when she attended religious schools in Louisiana, or if she had to unlearn anything she was taught there. “I was never someone who was necessarily a rule follower,” she says. “If anything, staying in line was more of a way to avoid conflict.” She talks at slightly filibustering length about always wanting to understand why different people had different beliefs, and credits moving to California with showing her “so many ways of experiencing life that I was not questioning or I was so unaware of when I was living back home”.From awol to A-lister: how pop stars from Charli xcx to Addison Rae found the fun in fame againRead moreHaving control over her expression is one reason Rae thought touring wasn’t for her. Until her own debut tour this year, she had made only guest live appearances, including withCharli xcx(“she taught me so much and believed in me”) – and experimental producer Arca, who remixed her heady song Aquamarine. In July, she supported and guested with Lana Del Rey over two nights at Wembley. Their duet on Diet Pepsi provoked total delirium. “It was really, really insane,” she says. Performing the song alone on the second date, she realised she was doing “something that I love very fearlessly – not carelessly, but freely. I really felt that click. As planned and perfect as you want everything to be, there’s something so magical about surrendering.”Rae’s own tour started in Ireland in August, to wild acclaim. Her staging was inspired by Alice in Wonderland and the Wizard of Oz, “this essence of unfamiliarity”, she says – though the abs-out choreo was pure Slave 4 U Britney and the million dollar bills with her face on, shot from confetti canons, very Richard Prince. (“It is deeply fun stuff,”wrotethe Guardian’s Daniel Dylan Wray.) She could have sold out much bigger rooms. “I wanted to give myself grace and patience in finding what my purpose is on the stage,” she says, though she was unnerved by these smaller theatre venues not having big screens – another curatorial tool. Without them, fans were “really forced to look at the stage and every single moment, which I thought was very vulnerable”. It turned out she loved it. “You could see every transition, every breath. It even further takes away this sense of control, forcing myself to face the uncomfortability of that.”View image in fullscreenAddison Rae performing with Arca at Coachella, 13 April 2025.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for CoachellaIt’s both surprising and understandable to hear how much Rae obsesses over control. Her appeal comes from her unaffected, sweetly giddy persona: during her Variety awards speech, she appeared genuinely breathless with excitement. She is also one of several pop stars who has put the fun back in fame after several years of musicians stressing how painful it is, the newly minted insider making a gasp-face at the thrill of it all on the red carpet. She treats celebrity as part of her craft and is open about craving it: “Have you ever dreamt of being seen? / Not by someone, more like in a magazine,” she sings on High Fashion (winningly, also the song she has listened to the most this year). “I enjoy fame,” she says plainly. “I think fame is very exposing and raw, and it puts you in a position that not everyone gets to experience. I enjoy the luxury of it all, though of course there is a price you pay.”That price is becoming an object of wild speculation. Her TikTok success led her to join the Hype House, an LA mansion where she and other platform stars, includingOrdinary singer Alex Warren, lived and made content – and spawned endless gossip. Her parents, twice married and twice divorced from each other, became social media personalities and generated a lot of messy headlines. (“Wish my mom and dad could’ve been in love,” she sings on Headphones On, a rare moment of vulnerability.) Footage of her introducing herself to Donald Trump at a UFC fight in 2021 attracted allegations that she was a supporter, which she denied (she spoke out in support of immigrants during heightened ICE raids this summer). There is a lot of crazy commentary about her online, and finding her feet as a pop star has been an exercise in reclaiming and relinquishing control. “There’s a very magical space in between those two things that you can always strive to accomplish,” she says.The 50 best albums of 2025: No 4 – Addison Rae: AddisonRead moreRae’s new year’s resolution, she says, “is to share less. I’ve actually been thinking about this so much. No one needs to know anything!” She laughs. “Obviously I love to talk and to share, and I’ve done a great deal of that on this call already, but I think the less you share, the more in control you are.” As for the rest of 2026, although she just got back from writing in Sweden, there’s no immediate plan to follow up Addison. “When something’s ready and done, I want to put it out as soon as possible,” she says.Going back to her maxim about taste as a luxury, this year she found a fanbase ecstatic at the prospect of a pop star who loves both Britney and Burial. She knows she can go further next time. “I trust that the people who indulge in my artistry treat it with kindness and acceptance and love and understanding, in a way that maybe I didn’t before,” she says. Other people won’t, she adds, “and that’s honestly the dream, that I’m never fully understood. If that ever were to change, I think it would be quite boring actually.”"

Losing one half of the show’s central duo was no easy thing to move past, but The Last of Us morphed into a touching meditation on grief, loss and the pain of love left unspoken – with added mushroom monsters.What we said:“A gutsy and thoughtful rendering of humans on the edge.”Read more49All Her FaultView image in fullscreenNo one is more watchable … Sarah Snook and Dakota Fanning in All Her Fault.Photograph: Peacock/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Is anyone as watchable as Sarah Snook? Her performance as Marissa, whose son Milo was kidnapped when she thought he was on a play date, was an absolute powerhouse as we’ve come to expect from the Succession star. It started with the most profound fear a parent can face, before it turned out to be even worse: orchestrated from within her own inner circle. But the plight of Dakota Fanning as her friend Jenny, trying to navigate the incessant hell and guilt of being a working mother, was relatable and affecting too. Together, they deepened this thriller into something far more intriguing.What we said:“All Her Fault is fantastically well done. All the carefully planted seeds come to fruition. All the narrative cogs turn and interlock fast and seamlessly. You come for the terrifying premise and stay for the absolute pleasure.”Read more48The Last Musician of Auschwitz(BBC Two/iPlayer) This exceptional film told the extraordinary story of the now 100-year-old cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, the only surviving member of the women’s orchestra at Auschwitz. First-hand testimonies – including from the stoic, straight-talking subject herself – plus archive footage and musical performances merged to show the emotional turmoil of prisoners playing beautiful music in a hellscape, as well as tiny glimmers of resistance.What we said:“This incredibly impressive programme does not let us forget about Auschwitz’s corpse mountains or stench of burning bodies for a second, all the while posing questions about art and humanity that should ring in your ears for years to come.”Read more47Apple Cider VinegarView image in fullscreenA tissue of lies … Kaitlyn Dever as Belle Gibson in Apple Cider Vinegar.Photograph: Ben King/AP(Netflix) A remarkable true story, superbly told; this series dramatised the rise and fall of Belle Gibson, an Australian woman who established herself as a “wellness guru” by falsely claiming to have mitigated cancer via dietary tricks and alternative medicine. The truth was simpler: Gibson didn’t have cancer and her career and persona was a tissue of lies. Kaitlyn Dever’s portrayal of Gibson was admirably nuanced; she’s deeply dishonest but also desperately needy and in denial about the consequences of her actions, not least for her followers, some of whom relied upon her hokum to combat life-threatening conditions.What we said:“A fast, drily witty, acutely intelligent, compassionate and furious commentary on greed, need, mass delusion, self-deception, the exploitation of the credulous and the enabling of insidious new forms of all of these by technology.”Read more46The ResidenceView image in fullscreenCharmingly good fun … The Residence.Photograph: Erin Simkin/Netflix(Netflix) Something terrible has happened at the White House! No, not Donald Trump’s new ballroom extension but a fictional murder at the heart of American power. This funny, quirky whodunnit starred Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, an eccentric detective (she’s a keen birder, dresses entirely in brown tweed and frequently utilises her binoculars for work purposes) sent to solve the case. It’s charmingly good fun – essentially a country house murder mystery with added snark and West Wing trappings.What we said: “A gorgeous, gleeful romp.”Read more45Common Side EffectsView image in fullscreenAn absolute triumph … Common Side Effects.Illustration: Adult Swim(Adult Swim/Channel 4) Has Mike Judge ever made a bad show? This is the question it was hard not to ponder while watching this impeccable animated thriller-comedy. The plot? A fungi expert discovers a mysterious mushroom that seems to cure all illness, and ill-advisedly tells his childhood crush Frances – who now works for big pharma. The resulting high-octane deep-state drama was a blackly humorous adventure with real heart that satirised the state of healthcare in a capitalist society. An absolute triumph of TV-making.What we said:“Not merely the best thing I’ve seen on TV this year but one of the best shows I’ve seen in my life.”Read more44Gaza: Doctors Under Attack(Channel 4) The film the BBC couldn’t broadcast. Thanks be, then, to Channel 4 for stepping into the breach and airing it – for this was an essential document of our times. Its unsparing look at the targeting of Palestinian medics showed a pattern that has emerged over the past two years at hospitals across Gaza. First, they are bombed. Then, they are raided and doctors detained and tortured. Then, when their workplaces are reduced to rubble, the cycle starts on the next hospital. The testimony by Dr Khaled Hamouda, whose home was bombed, killing most of his family … before a drone strike mere moments later hit the supposed safe house his remaining children had escaped to, was an unforgettable piece of television that really needed to be aired.What we said:“In an open letter before its broadcast, Channel 4’s Louisa Compton warned that Doctors Under Attack would ‘make people angry, whichever side they take’. She is right. This is the sort of television that will never leave you.”Read more43Am I Being Unreasonable?View image in fullscreenDangerously addictive … Daisy May Cooper as Nic in Am I Being Unreasonable?Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC/Boffola Pictures(BBC One/iPlayer) This riot of marital, sexual and social awkwardness (with a side order of murder and betrayal) came courtesy of Daisy May Cooper and Selin Hizli, who have created a worthy successor to Julia Davis’s scabrous 2004 sitcom Nighty Night. Cooper stars as Nic, a woman juggling guilt, trauma and parenting catastrophe, still finding time for extramarital hi-jinks and yetsomehowremaining deserving of sympathy, mainly because of the cavalcade of monsters around her. A dangerously addictive chamber of horrors.What we said:“Howlingly funny.”Read more42Task(Sky Atlantic/Now) This crime drama starring Mark Ruffalo as gone-to-seed cop Tom Brandis allocated a dangerous new assignment in Philadelphia certainly wasn’t for the faint-hearted. But if you could handle the all-pervasive air of impending catastrophe, it was a fine, gritty, twisty procedural centred on stick-up merchants, biker gangs and the grim ramifications of the fentanyl trade. An intense downer, in the best possible way.What we said:“A meditation on guilt, sin and the possibility of redemption.”Read more41The TraitorsView image in fullscreenThe worst traitor ever to roam the castle … Linda, with fellow traitor Minah and faithful Fozia.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert(BBC One/iPlayer) Before the celebrity version gave us Alan Carr, the third series of normies Traitors delivered Linda, AKA the worst/best traitor to ever roam the castle. Her head-turn when Claudia Winkleman said “traitors” wasn’t the only golden moment. Charlotte’s fake Welsh accent! Lisa the vicar’s bare-faced lie about her job! The shock return of Alexander! Rare is the show that makes appointment TV and creates national watercooler chat in 2025. But beyond all that – Claudia’s gothic outfits alone were worth tuning in for.What we said:“As a study of human behaviour – of deception, manipulation, self-preservation – it remains captivating. As perhaps the best example of social experiment-style reality TV, it has cemented its place in the cultural firmament.”Read more40-3140Dope ThiefView image in fullscreenRide-or-dies … Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura in Dope Thief.Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/AP(Apple TV) The two amiable, small-time Philadelphia crooks at the heart of Dope Thief have a good thing going. They rob low-level stash houses disguised as DEA officers and put on a performance of authority to avoid using violence. But when a big score at an out-of-town location is offered, they roll the dice and very quickly regret it: soon they have a bunch of very dangerous people on their tails. The key to this show was the chemistry between ride-or-die leads Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura. As the stakes rose, these alternately hilarious and heartbreaking hoods had us rooting for them in no time.What we said:“Brian Tyree Henry ranges from comedy to tragedy in a single scene and never misses a beat. He is extraordinary and the rest of the cast are up there with him. He gives Dope Thief heart and at times threatens to break the viewer’s. Wonderful.”Read more39Squid GameView image in fullscreen‘Hi, Cate Blanchett!’ … Squid Game.Photograph: Netflix(Netflix) Hwang Dong-hyuk’s killer game dystopia was one of those exciting shows that nobody saw coming – and it quickly became the biggest show of 2021. But after the sagging second series, the end was in sight with this final one. Fans simplyneededto know whether Player 456 – name: Gi-hun – could take down the evil game masters and VIPs from within. While he attempted that, new games meant more scream-at-the-screen entertainment, and we had other contestants to side with (or hate). The twists were totally bewildering (hi, Cate Blanchett!), which made this one hell of a ride to the finish line.What we said:“If you can get on board with the new contestant twist – and that is a big if – then the final two episodes have a nicely grand and operatic feel to them, and ultimately, Squid Game does its job.”Read more38Dept. Q(Netflix) Like a Scottish Slow Horses, but with fewer fart gags. This TV adaptation of a series of Danish crime novels – relocated to Edinburgh – was a sarcasm-packed thrill ride as it told the tale of unpopular maverick copper Carl Morck, sent to work on futile cold cases in the basement. You couldn’t help but root for the team he pulls together to track down a missing lawyer, but the show’s real joy lay in the dynamic between grumpy Morck andKelly Macdonaldas his cheeky, pomp-pricking, work-mandated therapist.What we said:“It is all fantastically well, and rigorously, done. The pacing has a leisurely confidence that some may find a touch slow, but allows for a character-first approach, creating a richness that amply rewards initial patience.”Read more37This City Is Ours(BBC One/iPlayer) The city in question was Liverpool and while the drug gang at this drama’s heart had the territory well and truly locked down, the internal politics of family and succession were a different matter. James Nelson-Joyce stole the show as Michael, the gang’s heir apparent who finds his assumed rise to the top threatened by retiring boss Ronnie’s (Sean Bean) surprising preference for his feckless son Jamie. Needless to say, as the brains and the brawn of the operation, Michael doesn’t take this well. This City Is Ours never fully escaped from standard gangster tropes but instead, leaned into them with compelling relish. And that final rooftop standoff! Breathtakingly tense.What we said:“The Sopranos influence can be felt” …Read more36The Beast in MeView image in fullscreenAwards will surely be given … Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys in The Beast in Me.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/AP(Netflix) An extraordinary performance of jittery, self-destructive anguish fromClaire Daneslies at the heart of this ambiguous psychological thriller. Danes is Aggie Wiggs, a creatively blocked and prickly author who is dealing with the trauma of bereavement. When Matthew Rhys’s rebarbative (indeed, possibly murderous) real estate magnate Nile Jarvis moves in next door, it seems like the last thing she needs. Sure enough, the pair hate each other almost on sight – but soon, a weird, co-dependent fascination develops between them which leads to some very dark waters indeed. The two leads inspire each other into something genuinely startling.What we said:“It is, they are, absolutely wonderful to watch. Awards will surely be given, and in the meantime you cannot look away.”Read more35A Thousand Blows(Disney+) The best of Steven Knight’s many shows this year, this punchy underworld drama contained pretty much a full house of his favourite tropes: strangely poetic outlaws, beautifully realised period trappings (London’s East End in the grubby, gruesome late Victorian era) and regular outbursts of bone-crunching violence. It also boasted a trio of magnificent lead performances: Malachi Kirby’s immigrant boxer, Hezekiah Moscow, was charming, principled and deadly, while charismatic gang leader Mary Carr (Erin Doherty) was shrewd and slippery. Meanwhile, Stephen Graham – an actor whose combination of vulnerability and volatility loomed over this TV year – was somehow terrifying and desperately poignant as fading prize-fighter Henry “Sugar” Goodson.What we said:“Hasan irresistible, Dickensian-yarn quality that helps smuggle in timely social and political commentary, much as the great man did himself.”Read more34I Love LAView image in fullscreenA gen Z delight … I Love LA.Photograph: HBO/Sky Comedy(Sky Comedy/Now) Is internet comedianRachel Sennottthe Lena Dunham of her generation? Her first comedy series certainly has potential to be as relevant to gen Z as Girls was for millennials. The show follows 27-year-old aspiring talent manager Maia (Sennott) in LA as she navigates relationships, friendships, career ambitions and all of life’s mortifying moments in between. It took a few episodes to find its feet but the cast burst with energy as they delivered near-constant gags. Plus, for the millennials: Leighton Meester guest stars as Maia’s boss.What we said:“The endless embarrassments and boundless opportunities of celebrity can seem, by season’s end, not too different from that of being alive, particularly in one’s 20s. It’s a bumpy ride, but they’re just getting started.”Read more33The ChangeView image in fullscreenGorgeous whimsy … Bridget Christie as Linda in The Change.Photograph: Photographer: Jon Hall/Channel 4(Channel 4) Bridget Christie’s comedy drama is something special: a deeply personal call to arms for menopausal women who feel invisible. It’s also hilarious. Linda (Christie) is a fiftysomething mother and wife who escapes life on a motorbike to go and find herself in the Forest of Dean. By series two, she has had quite an effect on the local people: women wear “Je suis Linda” T-shirts and, armed with their copy of Linda’s Ledger, boycott doing unrecognised work. But she’s still on her own journey, too, with plenty of touching moments and acts of sisterhood. All of this was explored with Christie’s gorgeous whimsy. What a shame Channel 4 cancelled the show, despite Christie writing it for a three-series arc. Hopefully it will find a new home.What we said:“The Change is still the best (and probably the only) TV comedy series ever written about menopause.”Read more32South ParkView image in fullscreenIncredible … Donald Trump and Satan in bed in South Park.Illustration: YouTube(Paramount+) After Paramount settled a lawsuit with Donald Trump for $16m (£13.5m) and discontinued Stephen Colbert’s show after the late-night host called the deal “a big fat bribe”, South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker signed a $1.5bn five-year contract with the network – and immediately fought back. Episode one starred Donald Trump with a micropenis, climbing into bed with Satan. ICE, AI, tech bros and Labubus have all been in the line of fire. For an animated show in its 28th series to not just stay relevant, but boldly retaliate against the Trump administration’s censoring of the media, is incredible. It’s also still really, really funny.What we said:“Even for a show like South Park, which has often been defined by its anger, this may well go down as its most furious ever.”Read more31Mussolini: Son of the Century(Sky Atlantic/Now) Joe Wright’s stylish adaptation of Antonio Scurati’s doorstop of a historical novel followed Il Duce’s wobbly first steps towards fascism, as he moved from national laughing stock to the March on Rome and his ultimate enshrining as dictator. Luca Marinelli was chillingly compelling as a fourth-wall-breaking Mussolini, walking the audience through each of his norm-shattering acts in a series that served as a honking great warning klaxon in these fractious times.What we said:“A brilliantly performed portrait of a pathetic monster.”Read more30-2130What It Feels Like For a GirlView image in fullscreenCertainly a wild ride … Ellis Howard as Byron in What It Feels Like For A Girl.Photograph: Hera Pictures/BBC(BBC Three/iPlayer) Based on Paris Lees’ unflinching coming-of-age memoir, What It Feels Like For a Girl followed Nottingham teenager Byron (an incredible breakthrough for Ellis Howard) who befriends a group of club-loving transgender women and starts to explore their own identity. Byron is far from a likable protagonist – but that, along with the nuanced ways the story tackled sex work and drug use is what made it so authentic, so bold. It was a challenging but captivating watch, made even better for capturing the 00s in all their inglorious mess.What we said:“It’s certainly a wild ride – I’ll struggle to look at a toilet brush the same way ever again.”Read more29AmandalandView image in fullscreenWelcome to SoHa, darling! … Lucy Punch as Amanda and Samuel Anderson as Mal in Amandaland.Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC/Merman(BBC One/iPlayer) Replicating the sheer watchability of Motherland’s phenomenal ensemble cast is no mean feat. But it certainly doesn’t hurt to draw on solid-gold comedy pedigree performers like Joanna Lumley and Siobhán McSweeney, plus Motherland’s most underrated character: the gloriously daffy Anne. Add in the subtlety and vulnerability that Lucy Punch brought to her turn as post-divorce queen bee Amanda, plus a script that skewered Insta-obsessed posh parents, and you had a televisual joy. Just don’t accuse her of living in South Harlesden: it’s “SoHa”, darling.What we said:“When writing is this good, it fizzes with the hysterical energy of perimenopause.”Read more28The BearView image in fullscreenStill hits so hard … Ayo Edebiri as Sydney in The Bear.Photograph: FX(Disney+) This one sure divided the critics. There were those who felt the hit restaurant drama that skyrocketed blood pressures and sales of sexy white T-shirts had served up its duffest course yet. But those who stuck with its fourth season were rewarded in spades with way less shouting of “Yes chef” and way more deep and brave and emotional television that had catharsis by the crateload. The under-the-table wedding scene? That two-hander between Sydney and Carmy (“I believe in you more than I’ve ever believed in myself”)? The funeral reveal (“I will fucking destroy you, Carmy”)? This was TV that still hits so hard.What we said:“Having put his creations and his audience through hell, showrunner Christopher Storer now lets the light in via a torrent of tenderly written, fiercely performed interactions where broken people who love each other start to heal, saying variations on those two beautiful phrases, ‘sorry’ and ‘thank you.’”Read more27Andor(Disney+) Probably the best and certainly the most universally appealing of the many additions to the Star Wars universe in recent years, this Rogue One prequel may have had the usual fantasy trappings but was also a stirring meditation on oppression and resistance. And dropping in the year of Donald Trump’s second coming, it felt particularly poignant and potent. It starred the excellent Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, a thief and scavenger whose home planet has been rendered uninhabitable by the Galactic Empire. Andor is a natural leader but he’s also a cynic; sceptical of revolutionary idealism. How does such a man turn into a freedom fighter, willing to risk everything for his cause?What we said:“Even when it’s in a lighter mode, Andor is Star Wars for grownups. This rebellion is a serious business.”Read more26HacksView image in fullscreenStuff of dreams … Jean Smart as Deborah in Hacks.Photograph: Universal(Sky Max/Now) Never mind that this wasn’t the Jean Smart-starring, odd-couple sitcom’s finest season. So glorious is this Emmy-winning tale of a veteran standup paired with a gen Z comedy writer that even a low-key outing is the stuff of most show’s dreams. This time round, we got a new roster of scene-stealing minor characters, heart-wrenching moments of pathos and zingers so acerbic you were in constant danger of spraying tea across the room. It also doesn’t hurt that the relationship between its two leads is one of TV’s most captivating.What we said:“Season four of Hacks is very funny. But what makes it really special is just how raw it is, too, ready to hit you in the feels when you least expect it.”Read more25Trespasses(Channel 4) This beautiful adaptation of Louise Kennedy’s layered story about a forbidden love affair set against the Troubles truly crushed hearts. It followed young Catholic teacher Cushla (Lola Petticrew) who falls for Protestant barrister Michael Agnew (Tom Cullen). Obviously, things couldn’t end well – as the story navigates the temperature of Belfast during that time. Gillian Anderson has, rightly, received a lot of praise for her portrayal of Cushla’s grieving alcoholic mother. But Petticrew is a rising talent, as proven in last year’s Say Nothing.What we said:“Trespasses seems like a collection of familiar melodramas, each borrowing from the Troubles for extra dramatic heft. The narrative is constructed with deceptive skill. As individuals’ hopes and feelings are crushed in the gears of events much bigger than them, we feel that pain.”Read more24The AssemblyView image in fullscreenRare candour … Danny Dyer is grilled in The Assembly.Photograph: ITV(ITV1/ITVX) There’s no denying that one of the great pleasures of this interview show was watching Gary Lineker subjected to an unfiltered grilling, just as he followed years of controversy by announcing he was leaving the BBC. But that was just one of many excellent reasons to tune in to TV’s most joyous chatshow, with the questions this group of neurodivergent people fired at a visiting celebrity leading to unfailingly brilliant viewing. The panel were fearless, funny and not afraid to ask questions most entertainment journalists wouldn’t dare to. All the celebrity guests, including Danny Dyer, Jade Thirlwall and David Tennant, answered with rare candour – while the musical performances left you bawling.What we said:“This is some of the warmest telly you’ll see this year … even when Danny Dyer starts dropping f-bombs left, right and centre.”Read more23Dreaming Whilst BlackView image in fullscreenAlways goes there … Adjani Salmon and his Tyrese backing singers in Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: BBC/Big Deal Films/Gary Moyes(BBC iPlayer) “Sometimes you have to Hit the Pavement. Ask Zohran Mamdani.” Since season two of his BBC comedy Dreaming Whilst Black came out, Adjani Salmon has been taking to the streets of central London with his Bafta in one hand and a poster in the other that says “Do you watch Black shows”. It’s an ace marketing strategy, but everyone in the UK should already know Salmon, and should already have watched his show – one of the most exciting and hilarious comedies of our age. In its second outing, aspiring film-maker Kwabena (Salmon) starts out unemployed – his uncle brutally roasts him, declaring “Kwabena is the only Black man in England that never got any work out of Black Lives Matter” – but soon lands what seems like a dream gig: directing a new period drama with colour-blind casting. Soon, though, the wheels come off (literally) in the most catastrophic way. It’s punchy and it always goes there; it even recreated the Tyrese Gibson RnB banger How You Gonna Act Like That. More please, BBC!What we said:“Dreaming Whilst Black remains rich with funny, true observations, about the hypocrisies and degradations of working in TV, and Black British life in general. Pertinent questions raised in this series include: “Who the fuck wines to Giggs?” and “What has Jamaican national dish ackee and saltfish – served on rye, no less – got to do with celebrating Barbados?”Read more22Riot Women(BBC One/iPlayer) This story about a menopausal rock band in Hebden Bridge was unmistakably by Sally Wainwright: a wickedly funny, hugely moving and personal take on women who feel invisible in midlife – with a few twists chucked in for good measure. The cast was some of Britain’s best, including Joanna Scanlan, Lorraine Ashbourne, Tamsin Greig and Sue Johnston. But Rosalie Craig was the standout as furious lead singer Kitty, who belted out their absolute bangers (“Give. Me. HRT!”). There was poignant social commentary, too, and many moments that were a reminder to call your mum tonight. But ultimately, it was a rollicking ode to women who won’t be ignored. Rock on series two!What we said:“Sally Wainwright should be prescribed on the NHS as a form of HRT.”Read more21MoView image in fullscreenAlmost miraculous … Mohammed Amer as Mo.Photograph: Eddy Chen/Netflix(Netflix) Mo is an almost miraculous thing, managing to find humour and humanity in the most impossible circumstances. And the worst of it is that while Mo’s struggles towards belonging in America during season one were already considerable, the Trump administration’s extreme hostility towards “invaders” makes the real situation for such people almost unbearable to contemplate. And yet, Mo’s Palestinian-American creator Mohammed Amer continues to make his extremely heavy points with remarkable lightness – really, the big takeaway should be that the pride, ingenuity and cultural richness offered by strivers like Mo would be an asset to any nation open-hearted and self-possessed enough to welcome them in.What we said:“Surely one of the most heart-rending things you’ll watch on TV this year. It brings together food, identity, immigration, family and Middle Eastern politics in a way that’s as fresh and intriguing as the falafel tacos that become central to the plot.”Read more20-1120Just Act NormalView image in fullscreenThere’s no other show like this … Tionne (Akins Subair), Tiana (Chenée Taylor), Tanika (Kaydrah Walker-Wilkie) and chicken in Just Act Normal.Photograph: Ben Gregory-Ring/BBC/The Forge(BBC Three/iPlayer) Drugs, social services, a live chicken: this wry comedy drama had it all. As if a comic tale of three under-18s desperately trying to avoid being taken into care after their mum vanishes wasn’t idiosyncratic enough, it set the series up with one of the year’s most astonishing narrative rug pulls. The youthful cast was astonishing, the gags were strong and its charmingly dark tone was like nothing else on TV. Eye-prickingly sad moments of childhood trauma rubbed up against satire, with plots that ranged from hilarious spoofs of heist movies to a tender teen romance whose early stage played out in a massage parlour. It also featured the most touching tale of a child bonding with a local drug dealer seen on TV this year. Like we said, there’s no other show like this.What we said:“It is, within each episode and over the entire series, beautifully structured and holds its many strands in perfect tension … It is altogether a wonderful thing.”Read more19ShiftyView image in fullscreenDazzling … a waxwork of Margaret Thatcher from Shifty.Photograph: Adam Curtis(BBC iPlayer) While it’s possible to argue that Adam Curtis has been telling variations of the same story for many years now (the slow death of liberal democracy and human autonomy at the hands of late-stage capitalism), he still finds new and dazzling ways of illuminating his thesis. Shifty was his most convincing offering in some time: an emotional rather than strictly historical journey and all the better for it. It begins in the Thatcher years and, using Curtis’s extraordinary skill as an editor and archive-hunter, maps a path to the New Labour years. There’s no voiceover – simply a cascading collage of imagery that feels at once familiar and revelatory. Curtis’s films are best appreciated as art installations rather than historical narratives, but this intuitive masterpiece felt convincing on every level.What we said:“It is an increasing rarity to stand in the presence of anyone with an idea, a thesis, that they have thoroughly worked out to their own satisfaction and then present stylishly, exuberantly and still intelligently. The hell and the handcart feel that bit more bearable now.”Read more18Slow Horses(Apple TV) We’ve reached season five of the little espionage thriller that could, and by this point it’s become a bona fide blockbuster. Though we can’t help but feel it’s a slight case of diminishing returns, this season still had Gary Oldman giving his all as the slovenly Slough House spy boss Jackson Lamb, Nick “Celebrity Traitors” Mohammed as the London mayor nearly getting shot in a mosque and the honey-trapping of Roddy Ho almost bringing down the whole of MI5. Thankfully, Jackson managed to step in with a cracking checkmate to save the day – and his Slough House crew. Or as he put it: “Fuck MI5. My gaff, my rules.”What we said:“Season five isn’t really about white nationalists, or environmental activists, or hostile foreign actors, and yet it is also about all of those things, all at once.”Read more17The Chair Company(Sky Comedy/Now) Fans of Tim Robinson’s awkward brand of humour were in for a real treat with this cracking series. He played family man and office worker Ron, who becomes obsessed with tracking down the company behind the chair that caused an embarrassing accident in front of his colleagues. But what starts as a week of angry emails and phone calls turns into a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and the unravelling of a man who has had enough. Bizarre, worryingly relatable and absolutely hilarious.What we said:“You can’t tell exactly when the next massive, stupid laugh is coming.”Read more16Last One Laughing UKView image in fullscreenAnyone who cracks is out! … host Jimmy Carr with the cast of Last One Laughing UK.Photograph: Amazon MGM Studios(Prime Video) It’s a simple concept: round up 10 comedians in a room and get them to try to make each other laugh – anyone who cracks is kicked out. No wonder it’s been a hit in 26 other countries. Joe Lycett lasted mere minutes, while Richard Ayoade’s deadpan ways consistently worked in his favour. Daisy May Cooper’s re-enactment of being on a rollercoaster deserves a shout-out, too, but it was Bob Mortimer who stole the show. So much so that he has already been confirmed for season two next year.What we said:“Bob Mortimer performed a magic act first seen on The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer 30 years ago and sang some songs he posted on social media during Covid. The fact that these routines not only found new life on LOL UK, but also pushed his fellow contestants to the brink, is testament to Mortimer’s talent.”Read more15PlatonicView image in fullscreenComedy gold … Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen in Platonic.Photograph: Katrina Marcinowski/Apple(Apple TV) Kayaking disasters, LSD-related wedding catastrophes and the most grim golfing-related accident ever shown on TV – in its second season, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne’s tale of two uni pals navigating midlife lost none of its anarchic spark. And yet its depiction of the pressures of working motherhood felt more acute than ever, with Byrne the standout performer, reliably turning in comedy gold that veered from deadpan to OTT frenzy. Not bad going in a year that her co-star broke records for the number of Emmys he won for his other comedy, The Studio.What we said:“The show does a brilliant job of capturing that feeling of exclusion from the real world that often accompanies motherhood, and Byrne expertly walks the line between aspirational cool girl and relatably downtrodden housewife.”Read more14Big Boys(Channel 4) It kicked off with Jack finally losing his virginity in a tent in Faliraki and ended up with an emotionally pulverising beach scene (“I didn’t make it did I?”) followed by the revivification of a most beautiful mate. But over three series, Jack Rooke’s gorgeous autobiographical uni comedy about awkward bod Jack (Dylan Llewellyn) and his straight best mate Danny (Jon Pointing) was never one to do things by halves. It tackled love, loss and the drinking of poppers. It had a fish named Alison Hammond, a dissertation called To Bum or Not to Bum, and it offered a masterclass in how to eat Peperami while giving birth to your delivery driver’s baby. But the way it moved towards its final moments was a masterstroke. We can’t wait to see what Rooke does next.What we said: “It’s heartbreaking, it’s beautiful, it’s a valuable companion in itself: sitcoms don’t get much more deep and meaningful than this.”Read more13Such Brave Girls(BBC Three/iPlayer) None of the characters are nice, but it’s almost impossible to watch an episode of this darkly comic, impeccably acted show about three women on the brink and not want to spend more time in their company. A ferocious, laugh-out-loud funny rampage through mental health crises, debt and toxic relationships. Given that creator Kat Sadler and her sister co-star Lizzie Davidson are wringing sparklingly bleak comedy out of material based on their own lives, it makes the bravery of this Bafta-winning creation even more impressive.What we said:“If you like your comedy scary, lairy and perfectly portioned, it is a total knockout.”Read more12PluribusView image in fullscreenSpectacularly original … Rhea Seehorn and Kevin Chambers in Pluribus.Photograph: Anna Kooris/Apple(Apple TV) With Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul behind him, there were huge expectations for showrunner Vince Gilligan’s new drama – but he has pulled off a spectacularly original sci-fi story. Carol (the brilliant Rhea Seehorn, who the show was written for) is a miserable novelist who is immune to an alien virus that takes hold of 99.9% of the world and turns them into a happy hive. As Carol tries to “save” the world, the show morphs into a sharply funny social observation and a psychological thriller that hums with existential dread. As per Gilligan’s works, trust and patience are rewarded – thanks in part to those hypnotic opening montages – and each episode racks up more questions that you’re happy to wait whole series to find answers to. It’s a good job season two has already been commissioned.What we said:“It takes some chutzpah to look at the world in 2025 – especially if you are a non-Maga citizen of the US – and say to yourself, “Yes, but wouldn’t it be almost more terrible if everybody just … got along?” But that is essentially what Gilligan has done. The execution may not be flawless but the audacity of the question is incredible.”Read more11The White LotusView image in fullscreenMelting hearts … Aimee Lou Wood in The White Lotus.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/AP(Sky Atlantic/Now) Parker Posey’s lorazepam-fuelled North Carolinian accent! Aimee Lou Wood’s melting of hearts! And … Patrick Schwarzenegger’s sibling incest! The third season of Mike White’s luxury resort drama, set in Thailand, might not have been the best – but it was stuffed with viral comedy moments, treacle-dark twists and career-high performances. This is still one of the most solid series going, with White taking it in weirder and wilder directions each time, so who on earth knows what the next White Lotus stay will bring.What we said:“Exquisitely shot, scripted, paced and performed, it’s a sumptuous feast for all the senses. ”Read more10-410Louis Theroux: The Settlers(BBC Two/iPlayer) As a follow-up to his 2011 film, The Ultra Zionists, Louis Theroux returned to the West Bank after the 7 October attacks, as more Israeli religious nationalists settled in the occupied Palestinian territory. Not many could keep their cool while having rifles pointed at them repeatedly, or when spending time with Ari Abramowitz, a gun-holding settler from Texas who refused to utter the word “Palestinian”, or Daniella Weiss, the outspoken “godmother” of the settler movement. Even Theroux, in a jaw-dropping moment, set aside his gentle persona and asked whether she is a sociopath. Bold, alarming and necessary viewing.What we said:“I’ve been watching Theroux’s films for more than three decades, and watching him be this forthright feels like a true watershed moment in his career. It suits him.”Read more9SeveranceView image in fullscreenTouching and troubling … Adam Scott and Britt Lower in Severance.Photograph: Apple TV+(Apple TV) Following up the stunning cliffhanger finale of this creepy workplace satire’s first season was always going to be a difficult feat. But this second outing managed to move past the novelty of a clever premise, featuring employees mentally “severed” into two personalities so that their workplace incarnations are ignorant of their personal lives and vice versa. What emerged were love stories that were touching, troubling and had a flair for wrongfooting the viewer, the show’s creepiest scenes ever and a terrifying guest spot from Gwendoline Christie that’s not just a strong contender for the show’s most memorable moment, but possibly one of her defining roles. Forget Brienne of Tarth: here’s Terrifying Corporate Goat Herd.What we said:“Severance is a rarity in so many ways – stylish without sacrificing substance, a thoroughly singular vision, fresh, challenging, a wholly credible world made of a tissue of incredulities.”Read more8How Are You? It’s Alan (Partridge)(BBC One/iPlayer) The Gibbons brothers’ BBC revival of Partridge continued apace with this triumphant return to fly-on-the-wall TV redolent of I Am Alan Partridge. This supposed attempt by the broadcaster to tackle a mental health epidemic had a wide brief: from episodes spoofing BBC show Winter Walks to Partridge taking on borderline consumer champion role that saw him tackle an unscrupulous tech boss on behalf of an unfairly sacked employee (only to “give her story the hearing it deserves” by flying one of the company’s jetpacks while screaming “Sell your kids! Get one before they ban it!”). He got wasted on white wine at a book club, was forced to let Lynne nearly crash his car and ruined her church music group by turning them into a rehearsal space for his electronic drum kit. Is that how you champion better mental health? Clearly not. But this is Alan Partridge, after all – on the form of his life.What we said:“Whatever medium he inhabits, Partridge remains the funniest comic creation in Britain, and even placeholder Partridge has more laughs-out-loud per half-hour than anything else on telly.”Read more7The RehearsalView image in fullscreenPrepare to be wrongfooted … Nathan Fielder in The Rehearsal.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.(Sky Comedy/Now) Nathan Fielder is worried about aircraft safety. Well, he might be. Or he might be using the subject as a smokescreen for a rambling, surreal exploration of the concept of authenticity. Or maybe a bit of both? Fielder’s new series – in which he tries to persuade the aviation industry to adopt new techniques to ensure better cockpit communication between pilots – will wrongfoot you so frequently you’ll end up stumbling in circles. Along the way, he builds a full-scale replica of parts of Houston airport, performs an experiment with a pair of cloned dogs and suckles on a huge model of the mother of heroic pilot Chesley Sullenberger. He also (quite literally) sticks the landing in a way that genuinely leaves you gasping. Whatever you expect this show to be, prepare to be wrong. But prepare to be dazzled too: no one else makes television like this.What we said:“At the end of the finale, I realised that all I had written for the final 30 minutes was ‘how on EARTH did they do this????’ over and over again, like a bad version of the typewriter scene in The Shining.”Read more6Alien: EarthView image in fullscreenHell was unleashed …. it’s the demon-eyed sheep on Alien: Earth.Photograph: FX(Disney+) Who could have predicted that a demon-eyed sheep would become the most symbolic baddie in the Alien franchise? Making a TV series of the beloved films (the first two, at least) was a huge gamble. But boy did Noah Hawley pull it off. Fleshing out the mythology, he introduced us to a not-so-far-fetched dystopia where a rich brat in pyjamas called the shots and immortalised dying children via synthetics. He also really wanted aliens. But when his wish came true, hell was unleashed: the trypanohyncha ocellus – a tentacled eyeball that buried itself in its victim’s eye socket, including that poor sheep – joined the xenomorph in scaring the bejesus out of fans. Hawley took his time in telling the story, but even when humans weren’t being ripped apart, the masterly production ensured a sense of doom and always had you wondering: who are the real monsters here?What we said:“The series always has a way of making us feel like helpless prey being circled. Something gloriously horrific is just around the corner.”Read more5Blue LightsView image in fullscreenWhat a show … Siân Brooke as Grace in Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/PA(BBC One/iPlayer) It’s meticulously researched, so rooted in its Belfast location that it feels like no other cop drama on TV, and almost certainly the show with television’s finest Westlife-based comic moment. As its third season saw action move to the drug trade’s links to wealthy elites it took a darker turn than previously, with fewer comic moments, and a run of grippingly tense episodes that repeatedly raised the bar for the year’s most intense watch. The stress of two officers failing in their battle to stop a car crash victim bleeding out, only to nearly end up being assassinated by dissident republicans while informing the driver’s parents of his death? Pfft. Standout episode Ordo Ab Chao saw a low-key restaurant disturbance end in a stabbing for constable Shane, while colleague Grace had to protect a witness against a carful of gunmen, despite having no weapons, armour or clue what she was supposed to do. At times it was stressful enough to give you a panic attack, and yet, it still managed to end the series on a joyful, smile-inducing singalong. What a show.What we said:“Blue Lights has quietly become one of the best shows on TV.”Read more4The StudioView image in fullscreenOne side-splitting farce after another … Ike Barinholtz, Kathryn Hahn, Seth Rogen and Chase Sui Wonders in The Studio.Photograph: AP(Apple TV) Seth Rogen’s sitcom about a Hollywood film studio broke records for the number of Emmys it won, and with good reason. Despite being stuffed with brilliant celeb cameos (Dave Franco as a live wire, drug-taking party monster! Ron Howard knocking Rogen head over heels in a fight!), its core cast outshone them, oozing astonishing comic flair as they rattled through one side-splitting farce after another. The show’s embrace of its subject matter extended to a soundtrack of big band-style skittering drums redolent of golden era Hollywood and artfully directed episodes whose camerawork included one filmed in an elaborate single-take shot (while the plot of the episode is about a film-maker trying to get an elaborate single-take shot). Don’t let the highfalutin artsy stuff fool you, though: after all, one of the most memorable moments of this hilariously slapstick show is a drug-addled, violently spray-tanned Bryan Cranston in a leopard-skin thong. Unforgettable.What we said:“Many things mark The Studio out from the ever-increasing herd of satires on Hollywood. There is the unimpeachable casting, from core to cameos; the former comprising not just Catherine O’Hara as the raw-nerved Patty but also Kathryn Hahn as permanently, incandescently furious marketing maven Maya.”Read moreNo 3 coming soonStay tuned for the next episode"

Which makes the distance in2000 Meters to Andriivka, Ukrainian directorMstyslav Chernov’s follow-up to theOscar-winning20 Days in Mariupol, all the more unbelievable. Here, on this brief wooded strip of land in late 2023, Ukrainian soldiers clawed their way towards the abandoned, one-street town – a supposedly key notch in the Russian supply line – battling Russian artillery fire, snipers and aerial attacks. An advance that would ordinarily take about 10 minutes to run takes several lethal weeks.In both a feat of film-making and frontline reporting – at the time, Chernov was virtually the only documentarian on the frontline of a conflict rife with Russian propaganda and misinformation – we experience all 2,000 meters to Andriivka as the soldiers do: inch by inch, meter by meter, a senseless barrage of carnage from seemingly everything everywhere all at once, a fever dream of first world war-style trenches and modern drone dystopia. Chernov seamlessly weaves together soldiers’ bodycam footage – harrowing first-person windows into the terror and fog of war – and his own recordings, embedded with Ukraine’s third assault brigade during what turned out to be a largely disappointing counteroffensive. Chernov managed to catch many of the soldiers, mostly boyish twentysomethings who had other plans before Russia’s full-scale invasion, in moments of downtime or reflection, in breaks from the slog. For many, it’s their last record.If this sounds borderline unwatchable, well, yes, 2000 Meters to Andriivka is almost unspeakably devastating. I have never left a film more psychically and physically sore, than after watching these men who, in another timeline, would be attending university or starting careers and families, men the same age as my still-childlike brother – and from spending a full 106 minutes braced for impact. But it is astonishing film-making – as a document of 2020s warfare, as a record of what actually happened, as a memorial to who and what was lost, as a testament to the courage of Ukrainian resistance and the senselessness of this fight in the first place.I have thought often, in the months since I first watched it – while so much of the international community has accepted some level of permanence to Russia’s invasion – of a fear Chernov voices towards the end of the film: “The longer the war goes on, the less people will care about it.” There is, it seems, some horrible, disconsolate truth to that. But 2000 Meters to Andriivka ensures that, as pyrrhic as the victory at Andriivka may have been and as intractable as the conflict now seems, the specifics will be remembered.Explore more on these topicsCultureBest films UK 2025Documentary filmsUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-2130Oklou – Choke EnoughTrance, medieval polyphony and Y2K pop may seem like odd bedfellows, but French singer-producer Oklou cast them all in a dawn-like haze on her gorgeous debut album, flowing these distinct disciplines together until they swooped and soared like a flock of starlings. Choke Enough was no academic exercise, either, with standout pop moments including Take Me By the Hand with Bladee – a winsome conjuring of how Alice Deejay might sound in collaboration with a piping minstrel.LS29Jacob Alon – In LimerenceView image in fullscreenRustling with life … Jacob Alon performing at the ZYN Rolling Stone UK Awards, in London’s Roundhouse.Photograph: Sue Moore/Hogan Media/ShutterstockOne of the star-making moments of the year was at the Mercury prize, as Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon reduced the arena audience to a hush with just a voice and an acoustic guitar (though there were delighted whoops when a call of “free Palestine” was folded into their rendition of Fairy in a Bottle). It hopefully brought a broader audience to their debut album In Limerence, which has shades of Adrianne Lenker, Jeff Buckley and even Paul McCartney’s cadences to its unguarded indie-folk. It would have been easy to make this music blandly beautiful, but Alon and producer Dan Carey keep it rustling with life, as they reach for a burbling synth, trumpet improvisation or dusty-sounding drum kit.BBT28KeiyaA – Hooke’s LawThe title of the Chicago producer’s second album references the law of physics that reflects how stretch is proportional to load, how a spring always bounces back when tested within its elastic limit. The whistlestop Hooke’s Law expands and contracts accordingly as KeiyaA’s trifles with loss and romantic disappointment find their embodiment in racing breakbeats and collagist chaos one minute, gorgeous, soul-weary stillness – as with the liquid Stupid Prizes – the next. Listening can feel like being pleasurably blitzed with sensation, with each repeat revealing new details: an invitation to submit to KeiyaA’s masterful grip.LS27Wet Leg – MoisturizerIn 2022 they released one of the 21st century’s biggest indie debuts, which scored a UK No 1 and Grammy and Brit awards. The pressure was there for the follow-up, but not only did it top the charts again and earn another couple of Grammy noms, it had even more swagger and heart. “You wanna fuck me, I know, most people do,” Rhian Teasdale shrugs on Mangetout, and she actively intimidates a lustful bloke on Catch These Fists – but much of the album is given over to her wonderment at falling in love. “I’ll be your Davina, I’m coming to get you … I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”, she sings: great new vows for millennial weddings.BBT26Wolf Alice – The ClearingView image in fullscreenSomething symphonic … Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice performing at Manchester Arena.Photograph: Andy Von Pip/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” Wolf Alice’s drummerJoel Amey saidas The Clearing was announced – and sure enough, this was a huge step up and out for a band who were already one of British indie’s biggest. There’s something symphonic about the heft of it and not just because of the string sections, thanks to superb production by Greg Kurstin: the bass and toms are heavy yet warm, the piano pounding yet not overbearing. Ellie Rowsell sings about suitably big themes, too, from universe-bending love on Leaning Against the Wall (“it really, really made the room sing, the way you said my name”), invaluable friendship on Just Two Girls, and The Sofa’s uplifting manifesto for being wild and indolent instead of toeing the line.BBT25Wednesday – BleedsThe North Carolina band’s sixth album is littered with endings, some violent – the title of Carolina Murder Suicide tells you all you need to know – some devastatingly mundane, as Karly Hartzman examined the cracks that led to a long relationship’s end. Her unique gaze unites both, noticing the details and dynamics that other songwriters might write off as inconsequential: like the “mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail” at a wake in Wound Up Here (By Holdin On). Full of screaming noise and riffs that evoke knee-sliding through the mud, as well as moments of unexpected sweetness, Bleeds shows the fullest picture of her band yet.LS24Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenUncontainable euphoria … Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta of Titanic.Photograph: Janet ChauThere can be few faster-evolving ensembles than that of Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta, who in just two albums have leapt from sparkling cabaret jazz to … whatever the uncontainable euphoria of Hagen is. It’s a record that vaults from blast beats to choral beauty, eerie splendour to nervy cacophonies, like nothing else you’ve heard. Despite these bold stylistic clashes, it hangs together beautifully, thanks also to Fratti’s spectacular voice, as capable of cirrus-like delicacy as parched sharpness.LS23Cate Le Bon – Michelangelo DyingWhere two of this year’s most prominent breakup albums were savage (Lily Allen) or spectacular (Rosalía), Welsh innovator Cate Le Bon’s hypnotically murky seventh album reflected the circular sadness of love faltering – the catch-22 of wanting to escape heartbreak while knowing that letting go means relinquishing something that was once profound. Michelangelo Dying contains some of her very best choruses and melodies, powerful enough to penetrate the album’s billowing haze of guitar, sax and synths, like a hand reaching out in the dark.LS22Little Simz – LotusView image in fullscreenWider reckoning … Little Simz performing at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianSimz’s sixth album came amid a dispute with the Sault producer Inflo – she has sued him for allegedly failing to repay a loan – and a couple of tracks target him in all but name (“You talk about God when you have a God complex / I think you’re the one that needs saving”). But Simz seems to be having a wider reckoning: she revels in how far she’s come from once just having “a dream and a pushbike”, and reflects on self-preservation, creative frustration and – in a gorgeous, naturalistic back-and-forth with Wretch 32 – push-pull family dynamics.BBT21John Glacier – Like a RibbonFor all that you can link her to trip-hop and cloud rap, what British MC has ever really sounded like this? It would be easy to call Glacier monotone, but in truth her careful, even flow holds so much musicality: her deliberately limited melodic and rhythmic range means that the subtle distinctions in her vocals are fascinating, as she goes from bored to wry to boastful to poignant within one-degree turns on the emotional thermostat. The grainy, faintly corrupted beats are superb, but it’s that delivery, and her lyrics themselves – stoic and even amused as life blows her from place to place – which make this album an all-timer in UK rap.BBT20-1120Aya – Hexed!A series of surreal vignettes confronting addiction, panic and the challenges of growing up queer, Aya Sinclair’s experimental electronic masterwork is a wind-whipped dash around the towns and moors of Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. From the rotor blade-whomp of Peach to the infernal pattering snares on Navel Gazer, her sound design hits you like a ton of feathers: a surreal, destabilising flurry of detail. And the lyrics, done as careful mutters or sarky sing-song, are world-class. Her poetry revels in multiple meanings – is she saying “Flemish” or “phlegmish”? – and in the plasticity of language, rhyme and even lived experience, whether retelling a toxic relationship (“Couple rows so we could pop our cysts / as though the pus’d bust right out of the tryst”) or evoking the feeling of being totally cut adrift: “Abseil away another day supine inside the bag.”BBT19Clipse – Let God Sort Em OutView image in fullscreenRich with wisdom … Malice and Pusha T of Clipse.Photograph: Cian MooreThey may have been outdone by Oasis as 2025’s most anticipated fraternal comeback, but there was still considerable excitement around the return of Gene and Terrence Thornton, AKA Clipse’s Malice and Pusha T. After making two of the best albums in 00s rap, Malice found God and left Pusha to it. But on returning, Malice’s mic tone – which always had a sort of ancient, oaken majesty to it – felt rich with wisdom, while Pusha, who in the interim had beefed Drake to hugely entertaining effect, still had his nose for a scrap, this time with Travis Scott. Together, they advocated for their own brilliance and for what they see as a better class of rap, sometimes at the same time: “They content-create, I despise that / I create content then they tries that.”BBT18Big Thief – Double InfinityAfter their bassist Max Oleartchik left the group, Big Thief pressed on as a trio but brought in a number of auxiliary musicians, resulting in an album that sounds like it could have been worked up around the campfire of a utopian off-grid commune. These are some of the American band’s best, biggest-hearted songs to date, with the type of easy facility with melody – and equally easy access to their emotions – that can’t be taught. Take Grandmother, in which frontperson Adrianne Lenker surveys our collapsing world and flawed humanity, and decides on the singalong chorus: “Gonna turn it all into rock’n’roll.” In many other hands this would be trite, but as with so much of Big Thief’s music, the purity of intention makes it life-affirming.BBT17Alex G – HeadlightsView image in fullscreenA new frontier … Alex G.Photograph: Chris MaggioWhat constitutes integrity? Working for love or money? Freedom or obligation to others? On his first album for a major label, standing at a new frontier of success, Alex G weighs these existential questions in appropriately vast, beautiful indie-rock epics, some breathless with anxiety (Spinning), others sardonic (Real Thing) or severe (Headlights). Despite the very contemporary, very Alex G touches – take the sprite-like voices and distortion of Bounce Boy – there’s a comforting solidity to this record that makes it feel as though it’s existed for ever, sharing the same spooked twilight as the best of Yo La Tengo and REM.LS16Pulp – MoreThe anticipation of a reunion album rarely measures up to the often dismal results. Perhaps the key is to spend a solid chunk of years playing together again, as Pulp did, before risking putting anything down on record. “I exist to do this / Shouting and pointing,” Jarvis Cocker sang on comeback single Spike Island; anyone who’s seen Pulp in recent years can attest that he has lost none of his calligraphic physical flair. Nor, as the magnificent More proves, has his gimlet eye for the grubby disappointments of middle age diminished. Life apparently feels no less of a charade at 62 than early adulthood did back in the 90s, a fact he sells as both anticlimax and a weird kind of comfort: if that’s the case, the unvarnished love songs and heartfelt stands against commodification suggested, you might as well stick it all on the line.LS15Turnstile – Never EnoughView image in fullscreenUncomplicated thrills … Turnstile in concert in Guadalajara, Mexico.Photograph: Medios y Media/Getty ImagesIs it hardcore punk or not? As this dull debate brewed on comment sections and Discord servers, the rest of the world got on with the business of just enjoying the uncomplicated thrills on Turnstile’s latest. Certainly, Seein’ Stars sounds like 90s Duran Duran, the epic title track could be played as NFL teams run on to the field and even the hardcore-paced Dull and Solo have a sheen to them. But for every frowning punk purist, you had 10 more lining up to pile into the pit with smiles a mile wide.BBT14Deftones – Private MusicThis was the US alt-metallers’ first album back after serendipitously getting a huge new following via TikTok, particularly for their sweeter, shoegazier material. But rather than court that audience by cynically remaking Sextape 11 times over, they instead created a balletic cyborg of a record. The riffs could put a dent in concrete masonry, but the groove-metal rhythms are light-footed and, as ever, vocalist Chino Moreno sets out even wider tonal possibilities. It’s as if waves of pain and relief pass across his spirit as he goes from dry croaks to thunderous denouncements to blissful clean singing.BBT13Suede – AntidepressantsThree decades since their debut and five albums into the second phase of their career, Suede sound as impassioned and vital as they ever have. Brett Anderson’s voice is a long way from the nasal sneer of Animal Nitrate all those years ago: it’s now rounder and deeper in colour, reminiscent of Echo and the Bunnymen’s Ian McCulloch, but the core Suede theme – humanity in all its reckless and sexy brokenness – is still there. Playing post-punk with a Britpop grandeur, Anderson and co reckon with the fleeting nature of existence (“Formless as a cloud / Weightless as a sound”) and the caprices of brain chemistry, but with a sense of optimism, even triumph.BBT12Jim Legxacy – Black British Music (2025)View image in fullscreenMore assured … Jim Legxacy.Photograph: Igoris TarranHis previous mixtape Homeless N*gga Pop Music was at No 42 in our 2023 albums list; rapper-producer Jim Legxacy jumps up the rankings as his place in British rap becomes more and more assured. Beats-wise, he defines the joyous anything-goes energy of the current UK underground, expertly applying chipmunk effects to samples, adding funny DJ-style vocal tags (“turn that mediocre bullshit off, we’re listening to Jim Legxacy right now!”) and even making a left turn into high-tempo pop-rock for ’06 Wayne Rooney. There’s more of a mournful cast to the lyrics though, as he works through grief for his late sister, and confronts the lingering effects of his impoverished, fatherless childhood.BBT11Jade – That’s Showbiz Baby!Pop’s trickiest manoeuvre is crossing the divide from successful group to solo career. After departing Little Mix, Jade Thirlwall didn’t so much jump it as pirouette across: her multi-part debut solo single Angel of My Dreams was completely nuts, impossible to ignore and spent 20 weeks on the UK chart. Could a whole album match up? From trashy ballroom house (It Girl) to disco-funk (Fantasy, Headache), Robyn-esque sad bangers (Plastic Box, Self Saboteur) and waltz-time ballads (Natural at Disaster), she certainly has the range, not to mention smart and sweary lyrics – rhyming Edward Enninful with experimental is a neat encapsulation of what moves her. It’s her voice that really sets it all apart, though: as you’d expect of a talent show graduate turned longtime pop star, it remains stunning on a technical level, but Thirlwall also brings a whole West End musical’s worth of emotion.BBT10-210Billy Woods – Golliwog“The English language is violence, I hot-wired it / I got a hold of the master’s tools and got dialled in,” Billy Woods announces at the outset of a rap masterpiece that works both as stunning poetry on the page and thrilling music out of loudspeakers. With intensely vivid lyrics, he picks his way through psychic wreckage wrought by racism, poverty, war and more, menaced by horrible dreams (“Didn’t want the doctor to turn, I knew it’d be something awful on the ultrasound”) and dispensing jaded wisdom: “Amputation how you survive / Can’t get away if you don’t leave something behind.” And then there’s Misery, a vivid romcom about a polyamorous and possibly vampiric lover. Frantz Fanon, Cecil Rhodes, Miles Davis and “Black Thanos” are among the other figures populating these strange, heat-sick tracks, helmed by a diverse and stellar range of production talent including the Alchemist, DJ Haram and Kenny Segal.BBT9Geese – Getting KilledView image in fullscreenOutrageously accomplished … Geese.Photograph: Lewis EvansThe ways that love unravels us and knits us back together are explored on the outrageously accomplished and wise fourth album from the New York garage rock band, who are still in their early 20s. They originally formed as kids at a Brooklyn music school which partly explains the depth of their connection, but there’s something bigger at work: how to explain the way a tiny chord change can carry so much emotional weight, or how these songs can groove so tightly at the waist while their arms flail this way and that. Cameron Winter’s lyrics and vocals are peerless, too, done in a reedy head voice that’s also somehow soulful. He’s trying to live his life on a higher frequency than the rest of us, but so often he’s having his heart broken, “getting killed by a pretty good life”, or hemmed in by his circumstances: “I was a sailor, and now I’m a boat / I was a car, and now I’m the road,” he glumly pouts on Bow Down.BBT8Bad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosWith the absolute integrity that has become his trademark, Bad Bunny shone his inestimable spotlight back on his roots in Puerto Rico for his sixth album, singing of sacrifice, colonial oppression and the importance of preserving tradition. He’s an incredible conduit, synthesising the past – salsa, bolero, perreo – with the present, bringing local artists including RaiNao and Lorén Aldarondo along for the ride. As if it needed stressing, Debí … also underscored his own legacy, and his incredible range: heartbroken that life must one day end on Baile Inolvidable; lovelorn in the rave on Perfumito Nuevo; seemingly cast in moonlight on the heavy Bokete.LS7Lily Allen – West End GirlLily Allen’s divorce album is so lurid in its apparent disclosures (she has said she employed some poetic licence) that it felt as though there was a risk of the carcass being tossed aside once the tabloids had picked it clean for gossip. But the quality of the songwriting and silvery electronic production, as well as the tangibility of Allen’s hurt and her ability to mint viral bits in “who the fuck is Madeleine” and Nonmonogamummy, gave West End Girl not just staying power but a place in the pantheon of great breakup albums. Standout Pussy Palace turned the grottiest of reveals into a kind of cosmic reverie that seems to suggest the elemental rearrangement of life as she knew it; the guttingly powerful Relapse, about the sober musician’s fear of losing her grip after her relationship breakdown, highlighted the temptation of oblivion in numbed-out vocoder. It lands light as icing sugar but lingers deadly as toothache.LS6PinkPantheress – Fancy ThatView image in fullscreenBreathless … PinkPantheress.Photograph: Charlie EngmanTrue to her form for writing the shortest songs in the biz, in just 20 minutes and 34 seconds, PinkPantheress vaults from weed highs to romantic lows, obsessive crushes to gripping paranoia, seduction to confrontation. (“The status cheque is due / So do I still belong to you?” from Nice to Know You, is a classic bluff call.) The music of Fancy That is just as much of a slip’n’slide through British club culture at its most playful and dazzling, from jungle to UKG and the big-tent joys of Underworld, Basement Jaxx and even the hyper-cheesy Just Jack, samples she deploys expertly, and all threaded together by her pointedly sugary voice. It’s a breathless ride, and PinkPantheress’s best case yet for her micro melodramas: why dither when you can pack this much into so little?LS5Lady Gaga – MayhemUnlike the smooth tech-house flavour of her previous album Chromatica, and quite diametrically opposed to the dinner jazz of her albums with Tony Bennett, on Mayhem, Gaga returned to the operatic electroclash that powered her first two albums. There are synths that sound like a Dyson on its last legs. There are the kind of trashy guitars that contractually can only be played by someone sporting a lime mohawk, low-riding leather trousers and nothing else. There is the baby talk of her biggest hit Bad Romance, only where that was “Ro-ma, ro-ma-ma / Gaga, ooh la la” it’s now “Ama ooh na-na / Abracadabra, mutta ooh Gaga”.Read more.BBT4Addison Rae – AddisonView image in fullscreenDreamy synthpop … Addison RaeOnce derided as a former TikTok dancer who made ill-fated attempts to break beyond the platform, Addison Rae’s fortunes changed last summer when Charli xcx invited her to collaborate on a remix, washing away the sticky juvenilia of her social media fame. Her debut album offered up dreamy synthpop that was weirder and more interesting than expected. Opener New York begins sounding floaty and fizzy, but ends in a pummelling explosion of chaos; High Fashion and Times Like These were an experimental hallucination of trip-hop and R&B. The fact that Arca remixed Aquamarine says it all. The pleasures Rae sang about, however, were far simpler. The gauzy, romantic Summer Forever distils the vibe: how fun it is, to be “young, dumb and cute / Nothing to lose”; the record’s mix of hedonism and nostalgia, its proud anti-lore depthlessness and hunger for sensation feel like extremely 2025 techniques for distraction and survival.Read more.Rebecca Liu3Blood Orange – Essex HoneyDev Hynes’ fifth album as Blood Orange felt uniquely keyed into the fragmented, distracted headspace that comes after someone passes, in his case, his mother. Essex Honey’s restive nature was summed up in its painful opening lines, which you could read as the dying’s acceptance of death starkly contrasting the living’s ability to meet them on those terms: “In your grace, I looked for some meaning,” Hynes sings on Look at You. “But I found none, and I still search for a truth.” That search is wide-reaching: The Field refashions the Durutti Column’s Sing to Me as a racing hymnal made for the stereo of a Ford Escort. There are tough little Robert Rental-style post-punk gems in The Train (Kings Cross) and Countryside that bristle with frustration. Vivid Light is a plainly soulful duet with Zadie Smith; Life, featuring Tirzah’s unmistakable vocals, basks in languid, flute-dappled funk.Read more.LS2CMAT – Euro-CountryDespite its fraught creation, CMAT’s third album sounds like the supremely assured work of a songwriter whose powers have reached a new peak. It is, by turns, poignant, moving, furiously angry, uproariously funny and packed with incredible tunes. It strides confidently away from the country-infused style she minted on her 2022 debut If My Wife New I’d Be Dead – into territory that variously touches on jazz (Janis Joplining), raging alt-rock (The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station), soul-kissed pop (Running/Planning; Take a Sexy Picture of Me) – without in any way losing the essence of what made her successful in the first place.Read more.Alexis PetridisNo 1 coming soon***Come back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!

It honours a body of work rather than a particular performance.The Irish actor has received critical plaudits and nominations for film and TV performances, and has won Irish film and television awards and a Berlin international film festival award, but had not landed a major Hollywood prize.View image in fullscreenDomhnall Gleeson as Bill Weasley with Mark Williams and Clemence Poesy in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy“I first saw Domhnall in 2006 when he played the role of Davey in Martin McDonagh’s play The Lieutenant of Inishmore,” said Trina Vargo, the founder and president of the US-Ireland Alliance. “His talent was obvious 20 years ago, it’s been a pleasure to watch him go from strength to strength, and we look forward to honouring him.”The US-Ireland Alliance is a nonprofit that fosters ties between the countries and is credited with hosting one of theliveliest partiesof Hollywood’s award season. Previous award recipients include Jamie Dornan, Kenneth Branagh and Kerry Condon.Next year’s ceremony will also honour Maura Tierney, who starred in Twisters and is best known for the TV series ER.Gleeson made his name on indies and blockbuster film franchises such as Harry Potter and Star Wars and is a proliferating presence on TV shows.He plays the editor of a struggling Ohio newspaper inThe Paper, a spin-off from the US version of The Office which follows the mockumentary format. He stars opposite Jessie Buckley in the forthcoming BBC Christmas special, The Scarecrows’ Wedding and did voiceovers for Ken Burns’ documentary The American Revolution.View image in fullscreenRachel McAdams with Gleeson in About Time, 2013.Photograph: Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarHe has also appeared in two Apple TV productions, Guy Ritchie’sFountain of Youth, with John Krasinski and Natalie Portman, and Echo Valley, with Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney.AnEsquire profilelast month said Gleeson’s performances have earned praise “even as he has somehow remained critically underrated”. The article was headlined: “Why isn’t everyone talking about Domhnall Gleeson?”The Dubliner was nominated for a Tony for The Lieutenant of Inishmore in 2006 and for a Golden Globe in 2023 for The Patient, in which he plays a serial killer opposite Steve Carell, but has missed out on Emmy and Oscar nominations.The son ofBrendan Gleeson, his filmography includes Ex Machina, Anna Karenina, True Grit, Brooklyn, Calvary, The Revenant andAbout Time, a time-travelling romcom. He played General Hux in the Star Wars reboot and Bill Weasley in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.“When he’s performing his appearance is almost fluid, absorbing the contours of his characters’ expressions so thoroughly that he sometimes appears reconfigured,” said Esquire. It noted his “alabaster skin and burnt-sienna eyebrows” – a more lyrical description than the Guardian, which called Gleeson a“ginger Hugh Grant”.Explore more on these topicsFilmIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And for the first time in a generation, Equity’s film and TV members have shown that they are willing to take industrial action.“Ninety per cent of TV and film is made on these agreements. Over three-quarters of artists working on them are union members. This shows that the workforce is willing to significantly disrupt production unless they are respected, and [if] decades of erosion in terms and conditions begins to be reversed.”The vote was an indicative ballot designed to demonstrate the strength of feeling on the issue, with more than 7,000 members polled on a 75% turnout. However, actors would not be legally protected if they refused to be scanned.The union said it would write to Pact, the trade body representing the majority of producers and production companies in the UK, to negotiate new minimum standards for pay, as well as terms and conditions for actors working in film and TV.Equity said it may hold a formal ballot depending on the outcome of the negotiations, which, if backed, would give actors legal protection if they were being pressed to accept digital scanning on set.The decision comes after months of debate and growing concern about performers’ rights as AI becomes embedded in the creative industries, with high-profile actors urging Equity members to support the push to stop digital scanning.Adrian Lester,Hugh Bonnevilleand Harriet Walter have backed the union’s campaign to ensure AI protections for performers are written into union agreements.Bonneville said actors’ likenesses and voices should not be “exploited for the benefit of others without licence or consent”, while Lester said actors at the start of their careers often found it difficult to push back against body scanning.In October, Olivia Williams told the Guardian that performers were routinely pressed to have their bodies scanned on set without having a say over how the data was later used.The Dune star argued that actors should have as much control over data harvested from body scans as they do over nudity scenes. She said some contracts included clauses that appeared to give studios carte blanche over a performer’s likeness “on all platforms now existing or yet to be devised throughout the universe in perpetuity”.The arrival of the first AI “actor”,Tilly Norwood, further heightened concerns and demands for formal agreements on what is and is not permissible.In 2023, concerns over AI were at the heart of the Hollywood writers’ strike, with writers and actors warning that unchecked use of the technology could radically reshape the industry and undermine their roles.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionArtificial intelligence (AI)Trade unionsHugh BonnevilleAdrian LesterHarriet WalternewsShareReuse this content"

It culminated in 3,547 complaints being submitted about the 24 July edition of the show. More than 2,000 complaints were received on each of the two previous days.The vast majority of complaints were made in relation to claims of alleged bullying against Khan, who broke down in tears on several occasions. It came after the emergence of apparent cliques in the Love Island villa.Some viewers believed Khan was being subjected to negativity from the other women in the show, as she was often shown alone and subjected to jibes and eye rolls. Tensions reached a peak when she ended a relationship with one islander, Conor, to pursue another, Harry.Producers also raised the tension by showing Khan and another contestant criticising two other women. Concerns for her mental health were also raised as she was repeatedly shown crying.Despite the thousands of complaints, Ofcom ultimately decided not to investigate the show. It said the negativity towards Khan was not celebrated and that viewers of the show – and reality shows generally – had come to expect the kinds of scenes that were the subject of complaints.Other protests were from viewers complaining that one contestant who had left the villa was later allowed back in. However, ITV makes clear that producers can “reintroduce an islander seen in earlier stages of the competition who was previously evicted”.The broadcaster has also said participants are given training in advance of arriving in the villa, which involves the need to avoid “behaviour patterns associated with controlling and coercive behaviour”.In fourth place in the complaints charts was an episode of Vanessa Feltz’s Channel 5 show, in which the fashion designer Karen Millen described mothers who breastfed their children beyond six months as “selfish”.Viewers complained the item was misleading. Ofcom concluded the comments “did not raise issues under our rules” and medical guidance had been provided to viewers at the start of the section.Rounding up the top five was a GB News item from January, in which the presenter Josh Howie made a comment linking the LGBTQ+ community to paedophiles. He later said his was a comedy show and his comment was intended as a “joke about paedophilia in the church”.Ofcom’s subsequent investigation found the programme had broken broadcasting rules by including a “highly offensive remark which was not justified by the context, falling short of generally accepted standards”.GB News also apologised this week after a guest wrongly stated that the Duchess of Sussex’s mother, Doria Ragland, had spent time in prison.Explore more on these topicsLove IslandITV plcOfcomTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Burke was a toddler when her mother died from stomach cancer, meaning she has no memory of her. In the Islington council flat where she grew up, she shared a bedroom with her alcoholic dad who would give up booze only to fall off the wagon and, at his worst, became violent. When a stranger on the estate called her ugly in front of her friends, she cannily deflected the insult with laughter. “I’m the best dancer at the ugly bug ball though,” she hooted, and did a little dance.Burke would find her tribe on London’s punk scene and, in her teens, got the acting bug and a place at London’s Anna Scher Theatre school. This put her on the path to a brilliant and varied acting and writing career that saw her appearing in comedy sketches withHarry Enfieldand French and Saunders, being called a genius by Peter Cook and taken by Luc Besson’s private jet to collect the prize for best actress at Cannes film festival for Gary Oldman’s 1997 film Nil By Mouth. There, much to her chagrin, she found herself “accepting a bellini cocktail from Harvey fuckface Weinstein”.Such gobby one-liners are to be expected from a no-nonsense comic actor who finds fame “embarrassing”, but they are extra delicious when delivered by Burke herself.

The granite stones of the circle are luminous in this sombre landscape, like pale, inquisitive ghosts gathered round to see what we’re up to. Above us, a sea of withered bracken and gorse rises to Carn Kenidjack, the sinister rock outcrop that dominates the naked skyline. At night, this moor is said to be frequented by pixies and demons, and sometimes the devil himself rides out in search of lost souls.Map of standing stone locations, CornwallUnbothered by any supernatural threat, we are gazing seawards, towards the smudges on the horizon that are the distant Isles of Scilly. The clouds crack open and a flood of golden light falls over the islands. My companion, archaeoastronomer Carolyn Kennett, and I gasp. It is marvellous natural theatre which may have been enjoyed by the people who built this circle 4,000 years ago.We have met at Tregeseal to talk about the winter solstice. Carolyn’s work focuses on the relationship of Cornwall’s prehistory with the sky, and she describes the whole Land’s End peninsula as an ancient winter solstice landscape. This, she says, is because of the spine of granite that runs south-west along the peninsula, towards the midwinter sunset. If, for example, you stand at winter solstice by Chûn Quoit – the mushroom-shaped burial chamber high on the moors south of Morvah – you will see the sun set over Carn Kenidjack on the south-western horizon. And likely this is exactly as Chûn Quoit’s Neolithic builders intended.View image in fullscreenThe Tregeseal East standing stone.Photograph: Paul Williams/AlamyCarolyn suggests that Tregeseal stone circle was deliberately sited to allow people to view the midwinter sun setting behind the Isles of Scilly. “Seen from here, Scilly is a liminal space. On a clear day with high pressure, the isles look close up and just pop. On other days, they’re simply not there. The circle builders could have viewed Scilly as an otherworldly place, perhaps a place of the dead, associated with the winter solstice and the rebirth of the light.”Where better to celebrate the return of the light than on the Land’s End peninsula, which points towards the setting point of the sun on the year’s shortest day?We thread through the darkening russet moor past prehistoric burial mounds and heaps of mining slag to a mysterious monument, which may be the UK’s only ancient row of holed stones. Unlike the stone at Mên-an-Tol, their better-known sister a few miles away, it’s impossible to crawl through the Kenidjack holed stones; these holes are barely big enough to fit my hand through and very low to the ground. Archaeologists remain baffled.Carolyn’s theory is that the row might have worked as a kind of winter solstice countdown calendar, with the rising sun shining through the holes from late October until December and creating varying beams of light in the stones’ shadows. “Feeling the warmth of that golden beam of sunlight in the cold, dark moor gave me a visceral experience of how prehistoric people might have perceived winter solstice,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe Merry Maidens.Photograph: Charlie Newlands/AlamyToo many ancient sites are aligned to the rising or setting of the sun at midwinter or midsummer for it to be a coincidence. It makes sense that prehistoric farmers, who relied on the sun for light, warmth and the growth of crops, would want to track the sun’s movement. But in the 21st century, the darkness of this time of year still weighs on our spirits, and so we welcome the winter solstice, that darkest day of all before the hours of light begin to grow again. And where better to celebrate the return of the light than on the Land’s End (West Penwith) peninsula, which points towards the setting point of the sun on the year’s shortest day?Montol revives the old Cornish custom of guise dancing, with its elaborate masks and costumes, traditional carolling and music of pipe, drum and fiddleA bitter easterly is gusting, and eerie moaning rises from unseen cows as I tramp through soggy clover to pay a visit to the Boscawen-Ros stone, keeping watch as it has done for thousands of years above the peninsula’s south coast. It is just one of scores of prehistoric stones that stand alone or in pairs or circles all over the peninsula; less than a mile away are the famous Merry Maidens, dancers turned to stone for breaking the Sabbath. I think about how long the stone has persisted here, enjoying its view of the Celtic Sea and English Channel: where once Neolithic coracles would have floated, now the container ships and the Scilly ferry pass by.Christopher Morris’s mesmerising filmA Year in a Field, which documents 12 months in the life of this stone, draws attention to the power of its still and silent presence in the ever-changing landscape. “And I deliberately started and ended the film with winter solstice,” he tells me, “because it is a moment of pure hope – the promise of the ending of darkness and a bright new year ahead.”View image in fullscreenPenzance’s Montol midwinter festival.Photograph: Guy Corbishley/AlamyOn 21 December, all over West Penwith, people will be marking midwinter by walking to stone circles and holy wells, to hill forts and ancient beacons.Carolyn Kennettwill beleading a guided walkto Chûn Quoit to observe the sun setting over Carn Kenidjack. Morris will walk to the Boscawen-Ros stone, as he does every winter solstice, in a sort of ritual of reflection and renewal. Later he, like thousands of others, will crowd into Penzance forMontol, a midwinter festival that dates only to 2007 but revives the very old Cornish custom of guise dancing, with its elaborate masks and costumes, traditional carolling and music of pipe, drum and fiddle.Morris calls Montol “a wild night of misrule” – mischief and taboo-breaking are positively encouraged. The sun (in papier-mache form) will be set ablaze, while revellers disguised in animal masks, foliate heads or veils will dance triumphantly around it. There will be a herd of ’obby ’osses (hobby horses, including one called Penglaz and another called Pen Hood), dragons, fire-dancers and riotous merry-making. “A lot of sprout-throwing, too,” Morris adds. At 9.30pm those still standing will parade the Mock (the Yule log), flaming torches in hand, down Chapel Street to the sea. It is a fittingly uproarious and darkly magical celebration to welcome back the light.In enchanted West Penwith, where rings of dancers were turned to stone and the witches once lit solstice fires in the moorland cromlechs, the tradition of folklore, storytelling and community ritual is still very much alive. And especially now, at midwinter.Fiona Robertson is the author of Stone Lands, published by Robinson at £25. To support the Guardian buy a copy fromguardianbookshop.com.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.For a festival with childbirth at its religious heart, it is perverse how much of our traditionalChristmasspread isn’t recommended for pregnant women. Pre-pregnancy, this was not something I’d clocked. I was the soft cheese supremo, canape queen – at my happiest with a smoked trout blini in one hand and a champagne flute in the other. Then one day in October, two blue lines appeared on a test result and everything started to change: my body, my future and most pressingly my Christmas.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Don’t get me wrong: no present under the tree can match the gift I’ve got in store. But as a food writer who loves this season, I can’t think of a worse time to be nauseated, exhausted and forbidden by the NHS to eat, drink or do my favourite things to eat, drink or do in winter. I have no alternatives for saunas, skiing and hot baths. I do, however, know enough chefs, bartenders, retailers and producers to create a Christmas feast that is full of wonder, joy and within the NHS guidelines.It goes without saying that the NHS guidelines are guidelines, not gospel, and that you are a woman capable of independent thought and decision making. If you’d like to delve deeper into the data which drives dietary advice for pregnant women, Emily Oster’sExpecting Betteris a great place to start. And if that feels overwhelming along with everything else pregnancy brings – well, that’s exactly what the NHS guidelines are for.ChampagneThe most important of festive drinks, many brands have gone to great lengths to recreate the pop, look and feel of fizz, and while there is no real McCoy, there are many palatable options. According to Olly Smith, author ofWINE: Everything You Need to Know,Kylie Minogue No Alcohol Sparkling Roséoffers great (literal) bang for it’s buck. “It’s tremendous value for a celebratory glass of something which actually tastes decent, fruity and fun,” he says of the bottle, which is under £10 in all supermarkets. If you’re fan of kir royale, trySainsbury’s Alcohol Free Blackcurrant Spritz. “It blew me a way at a recent tasting,” he says.For those who prefer their bubbles bone-dry, there is the world of sparkling tea to discover. These are not “just like champagne” (so don’t let anyone tell you otherwise) but aren’t too sweet, the bubbles are fine, and they do a good job of feeling like a “proper” drink.Copenhagen Sparkling Tea Companysupplies sparkling teas for Selfridges and Fortnum and Mason that are delightfully complex, as are those fromSaicho. They’re not cheap – around £18.99 – but they’re cheaper than the more expensive non-alc sparkling wines.That said, if you don’t like tea, or the idea of a cuppa in your champagne coupe, then your best bet is sparkling wine which has been produced the usual way, then de-alcoholised. That process makes them pricey, but the alcoholic fermentation means they aren’t tooth-numbingly sweet.Noughty Non-Alcoholic Sparkling Chardonnayis the best I’ve tried; Smith swears byBolle Sparkling Rosé, which is double fermented “and doesn’t rely on pumping up the sugar to achieve its nuanced sense of grown-up balance”. And if you really love champagne and English sparkling, you might be better saving your money for when you can drink them – or having half a glass of the real stuff. That’s not NHS advice, but it’s what I’ll be doing come Christmas morning.WineFormer Guardian wine columnist Fiona Beckett now has a Substack calledEat This Drink That, Live Wellwhich is basically a gospel of good times and deliciousness. So when she says she has “yet to come across an alcohol-free wine that matches up to the full-strength version” and that they are “by and large… infuriatingly expensive” I feel no need to do further research. That has also been my experience. There is, however, a consolation prize: “non-alcoholic wine does make a decent mulled wine, so much so that I found myself saying, when I first made this, that I shouldn’t really have a glass before I went out to dinner.”The key, she says, is elderberry juice. “It gives the drink body, but it is quite bitter, so you do need to add [brown] sugar to taste.” For one bottle of non-alc red wine (I’m a fan ofWednesday’s Domaine, which brings body and heft), you’ll need 8 cloves, 2 unwaxed oranges, 330ml elderberry juice and a cinnamon stick, as well as sugar and optional orange bitters. Stick the cloves into the rind of one orange, place it in a small to medium saucepan (you want the liquid to cover the orange), add 125g (4½oz) sugar and the cinnamon stick as well as the bitters, if using. “Bring slowly up to simmering point over a low heat without letting it boil. Take off the heat and leave for 30 minutes to infuse.”If you didn’t mull your own wine when you were drinking, and don’t intend to start now you’re not, there are some pre-made versions. Fellow food writer Olivia Potts swears by Ikea’sVintersaga: a traditional Swedish Christmas drink commonly flavoured with spices like cinnamon, cardamom and ginger. “I begrudgingly drank it hot when I was pregnant,” she recalls, “and now I make special trips to Ikea every year to stock up.”OystersI am no huge fan of oysters. But I have learned to respect their inimitable flavour and the ritual of sharing them with family and friends. There is no substitute for one freshly shucked, but recipes for cooked oysters abound and mean you can still join in on the occasion without fear of poisonous repercussions. Chef Roberta Hall McCarron of theLittle Chartroomin Edinburgh actually prefers them cooked, under a gratin of sauteed spinach, wine, garlic and cheese topped with breadcrumbs. AtApplebee’s, a family-run seafood restaurant in Borough Market, chef Frankie Van Loo tops Maldon oysters with chorizo jam (easy to make, even easier to buy fromDukesHill) and bakes them in the oven. Rick Toogood, co-founder ofPrawn on the Lawnrestaurants in Padstow and London, favours deep-fried oysters with garlic creme fraiche. “Shuck the oysters, removing the meat into a sieve to drain any excess liquid (this will keep the oysters crispy),” he advises. The garlic creme fraiche can be whipped up with shop-bought garlic puree, lemon juice and chopped spring onion. Place a blob of that in the empty shells, top with a deep-fried oyster and garnish with more spring onion or herbs.View image in fullscreenAn oyster cooked in beef fat.Photograph: Jack Spicer Adams/The GuardianIf you can’t stomach an oyster, or don’t feel confident enough in the cooking process, you can still join in with the ceremony with a vegetarian version. Ask your local fishmongers for some empty shells (or head to Etsy, which abounds with them) and follow the advice of Ben Rand, executive chef ofBubala, the cult Middle Eastern vegetarian restaurant in London, whosedebut cookbookis out now. “Rather than trying to emulate an oyster, how about taking endive, filling it with some fresh citrus, crunchy nuts and a citrus puree. It has big flavours, it’s fresh, crunchy and saline, hitting all those touch points of an oyster without trying to be one,” he advises. Helen Graham, author of the forthcoming vegetarian cookbookCentrepiece, suggests roasting off aubergine cubes, tossing them with miso, agave, rice vinegar and ras el hanout, and spooning those into shells with a little creme fraiche and lime zest on top. You don’t need to all eat oysters to cheers shells and knock back something delicious.Paté and charcuterieKnow when you’re beaten, is chef Emily Roux’s take on paté and charcuterie. Cured meats must be cooked before being eaten, according to the NHS. Fine on a pizza, not what you want from a charcuterie board. Paté – all types, including vegetarian and fish as well as meat – is off the NHS menu, unless it’s served piping hot which kills any potential listeria but rather defeats the point of paté. “It’s difficult to recreate the same levels of satisfaction,” observes the chef behind the beloved Michelin-starredCaractèrein west London, so perhaps it’s something worth saving until after the baby’s born.That said, there are some things that might work on melba toast in pâté’s stead. Roux recommends making rillettes with flakes of hot-smoked fish (cold-smoked is verboten), creme fraiche, lemon juice and dill. Graham makes a maitake or shitake mushroom paté that would be as delicious spread hot and fresh as cold. “Fry a load of onions until deeply caramelised, then fry your mushrooms in butter and deglaze with a splash of soy and vinegar (add baharat if you have). Blend it all into a silky paté,” she says. Spread on melba toast, white toasted triangles or whatever you’d spread your regular paté on – though bear in mind your vehicle may need more structural integrity when the paté is hot.Smoked salmon blinis“There are certain combinations of ingredients that seem as if they were made for one another,” Nigel Slater famously wrote in his bookAppetite, and blinis and smoked salmon (or better from anethical and environmental perspective,smoked chalk stream trout) is one of them. Mercifully, most smokeries produce hot-smoked fish as well as cold, which means the flesh has been cooked through in the process. That is kosher, for the NHS. “It’s fully cooked, has the same richness and gentle smokiness, and works beautifully on a blini with creme fraiche and a squeeze of lemon – you don’t feel like you’re missing out at all,” says Max Bergius, founder of theSecret Smokehousein east London.“If you get the big sides of hot-smoked fish, then the flakes in the middle are not dry, so use those” advises Roux. If you’d rather wait until you can have the classic cold-smoked, she suggests serving cooked crab. “It’s a real crowd-pleaser, so if you served that on a blini, or as a starter with bitter leaves and blood orange, everyone would be happy.” Likewise, serving spoonfuls of grilled prawn cocktail on blinis, a la Van Loo at Applebee’s. The most important thing for pregnant women is that they feel don’t feel on the outside, says Roux, who has been pregnant herself over Christmas. “So find something that works for everyone.”Cheese“But what about cheese?” many exclaimed when I announced I was pregnant, as if all cheese was banned for the next nine months. This is untrue. If cheeses are blue, or if they are soft and have a white coating on the outside (the NHS calls these mould ripened), they’re verboten, but hard cheeses (unpasteurised and pasteurised) and soft cheeses that are pasteurised but aren’t mould ripened – mozzarella, feta, ricotta, cream cheese etc – are fair game.That leaves you with a lot of options, says Bronwen Percival, who runs the legendaryNeal’s Yard Dairyand has been pregnant at Christmas. “Appleby’s cheshire(this was my pregnancy go-to) is a perfectly balanced light and crumbly texture with juicy acidity and a warm dairy freshness.Coolea– an extra-aged gouda-style cheese from West Cork – is a real crowd-pleaser, with burnt toffee sweetness and a chewy, almost crystalline texture.” Both are artisan cheeses, available in all good independent cheese shops. A good, aged parmesan deserves a place on the cheeseboard too; crunchy, savoury and nutty, it’s not just for cooking.If you cannot bear the thought of Christmas without camembert, fear not: it just needs to be thoroughly cooked. “Stud with garlic cloves and rosemary, bake into boiling and serve with grissini. It’s super Christmassy,” says Roux.View image in fullscreenRukmini Iyer’s celebratory tomato bread and baked camembert.Photograph: Yuki Sugiura/The Guardian. Food styling: Valerie Berry. Prop styling: Louie Waller..CocktailsAgain, this is not something I’d clocked pre-pregnancy but many bars assume non-drinkers will want iced tea or spritzes. It’s winter. I want something strong and warming, not summery and full of ice. Step forward the no-groni, or faux-groni, or whatever you call a trinity of non-alc gin, non-alc vermouth and non-alc Campari. What it can’t deliver on booze, it can deliver on punchy flavours, and the look and feel of the real deal. Monica Berg of Tayēr + Elementary in London recommendsAmàrico Rossoas the replacement for vermouth; inThe New Bar, a zero-alcohol bar in San Francisco, they suggestLyre’s Aperitif Rosso. Sanbitter or Crodino are like Campari, but they’re sparkling so you’d be veering into negroni sbagliato terrirory; better to useAecorn bitter,Lyre’s Italian OrangeorMonin Bitter Syrupif you can find it. As for 0% gin, I favour Tanqueray.Not everyone is a negroni fan. The best non-alcoholic cocktail I’ve tried this year, hands down, is the pineapple picante fromEl Bar de Cavita, a subterranean Mexican bar and mezcaleria in London’s Marylebone. Limited experience has taught me the spicer the drink, the less noticeable the lack of alcohol, and this gratifyingly simple recipe really delivers. For one, it’s 50ml pineapple juice, shaken with 20ml each of lime juice, agave syrup andCrossip Blazing Pineappleand two slices of jalapeno, says founder and chef Adriana Cavita.Though I initially dismissedBotivoas a summer drink, several cocktails have proved otherwise. At Barbarella in Canary Wharf, I enjoyed it in a white negroni instead of Suze, and I’ve even made their clove sour at home – though instead of the ginger clove tea, I usedMother Root. Mother Root is this fiery, gingery aperitif created by a woman who worked in wine and wanted something just as complex to drink while pregnant. It has been recommended to me by almost every mum-to-be I know, and for good reason. Being gingery and spicy, it’s wintery by default, and it adds kick to mocktails (I like theirclementine coastandclouds and honey). It’s not cheap, though (none of these special alc-free drinks are) so if you’re the only one on the mocktails, you might want to buy pre-mixed. I like Black Lines non-alcoholicShirley Temple. It’s fun, it’s fizzy, it’s laced with blood orange, ginger and bitters, and by the time you’ve placed a fun glace cherry on top everyone will be clamouring for a sip.BaileysI have nothing. They have nothing. Just think how sweet it will taste next Chrismas.Explore more on these topicsFoodChristmasChristmas food and drinkPregnancyFamilyHealth & wellbeingParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Out of the corner of an eye I spied an old folder of pudding menus, all stained and tattered. A wonder at how this might have escaped notice was soon dispelled – unsurprising, really, given the usual state of my desk and shelves – and the page on which it fell open revealed the scribbles for a midwinter pudding menu. And, just like that, as if the scent rose from the page itself, came a memory of an almond, chocolate, walnut and prune tart being lifted from the oven, all mahogany hued and with a few bubbles bursting from the pieces of chocolate among the prunes peeking out.My appetite for almond tart has never waned; be it in a restaurant kitchen or at home, an almond tart is nigh-on inevitable. When I was younger, almond tarts were often made with ready-ground almonds and usually invigorated by a drop or two of almond essence, because they were often shy of flavour. But then bags of whole marcona almonds from Spain began to arrive, and quickly usurped any notion of baking with any other almond. Shaped like teardrops and almost milky in colour, delicate, buttery and freshly ground, these almonds imbue a tart with a superb quality and flavour. The benefit of not having to blind bake a tart case balanced the need to bake the tart on a rack sat in a tray to catch any butter and almond oil-infused tears released while baking.My fondness for baking means I have been on the pastry section of pretty much every restaurant I’ve ever cooked in. And, somehow, an almond tart always seemed to have been on the menu. Some remained plain, some were prettied up with sliced fruit such as apple, apricot and pear; another great favourite was to stud the tart with prunes. To partner those marcona almonds, the prunes had to be from Agen in south-western France, famed for their yielding texture and depth of taste attained by a partial drying (mi-cuit). So much so, in fact, that they’ve been granted protectedstatus.That same region of France is also home to some very fine walnuts, which also found their way into those tarts, as did shards of bitter chocolate. When I baked these atAlastair Little’s eponymous restaurant in Soho, we steeped Agen prunes in armagnac, but to spare the cook’s purse in these straitened times, amontillado sherry also pleases greatly. The resulting tart was well received and duly bestowed upon the restaurant menu and at home. As is the way of recipes, other variations claimed centre stage until a friend gave me a nudge and suddenly a sleeping beauty was awakened to be presented here.Almond, chocolate and prune tartMakes1 x 23cm tart150g cold unsalted butter250g ‘00’ flour, sifted75g icing sugarSea salt1 egg, beaten100g chopped walnuts12 Agen prunes, halved and stoned100g 70% dark chocolate, choppedFor the frangipane250g softened unsalted butter200g caster sugar2 eggs, beaten250g whole marcona almondsBest made early on, the pastry is a classic rubbing together to a fine crumb of the cold butter with the ‘00’ flour, icing sugar and a pinch of sea salt. Add to this the beaten egg and a tablespoon of cold water, knead deftly into a smooth dough and shape into a disc, then cover and refrigerate for at least an hour.The frangipane is made by mixing the softened butter with the caster sugar, then gradually adding the two beaten eggs. Grind the whole marcona almonds to a fine crumb, then mix those in. Again, this is best refrigerated.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to fit a 22-23cm tin with a removable base. Gather up the rolled pastry on to the pin and lay in the tin. Lift the edges gently and let the disc fall into the case, then push the edges downwards, pressing with your fingertips to ensure the pastry squarely lines the case. Pinch together any cracks.Put spoonfuls of the frangipane in the tin, but do not smooth. Push the chopped walnuts evenly over the tart, then lightly press in the halved prunes. Finally, strew the tart with the chopped chocolate, pressing it down lightly.Put the tart case on a rack, put the rack in an oven tray and transfer to the oven. Lower the temperature to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2 and bake for an hour, checking occasionally to see if the tart needs turning so it colours evenly. Lower the oven temperature to 120C (100C fan)/260F/gas ½ and bake for a further 15 minutes. The tart is best eaten warm with a jug of the best Jersey cream.Jeremy Lee is chef/co-owner ofQuo Vadis in London, and author of Cooking: Simply and Well, for One or Many, published by HarperCollins at £30.

Even so, I have a few ideas for drinks you might like to try instead.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Let’s start with the classics. There are many different sorts of port, including white and rosé, but you’re more likely to come across ruby and tawny ports atChristmastime. I like an LBV, a port that’s aged for up to six years in barrel, especially with cheese or anything chocolatey.Another bottle you’re likely to see at Christmas – and one I’ve finally got my family on board with – is sherry. Specifically, for us, pedro ximénez. It’s generally the most intense and sweet of the sherries, and made from grapes that are dried in the sun. The evaporation of the water in the grapes concentrates the sugars and flavours, which results in an intense and flavourful wine. I also like to use it when I’m making tiramisu and can’t find any marsala. (FYI, I likeSophie Wyburd’s hazelnut tiramisu recipe, which tastes like aKinder Bueno.)Or how about something completely different? Elleisha Adriana, head of wine atElephant, a new east London restaurant with an entirely Italian wine list, loves arecioto della Valpolicella, a sweet red dessert wine that’s also made using dried grapes: “It tastes like Christmas fruit cake, with slightly dried cherry, brown sugar and baking spice notes,” she says. “It also works amazingly with rich, salty blue cheese – the addition of the recioto della Valpolicella feels as if you’ve completed the whole dessert.”Sweet French wines also deserve a look-in. For instance,rivesaltes, a naturally sweet fortified wine that’s a blend of grapes (typically grenache blanc, grenache gris, macabeu and malvoisie du Roussillon) from Languedoc-Roussillon. Also from the Roussillon area isbanyuls, which is made from grenache varieties. Both go wonderfully alongside Christmas cakes and puddings, as well as anything intensely chocolatey, be that a Quality Street or an indulgent rocky road.Sparkling wines often get overlooked in favour of these deep, rich dessert wines, but might I also turn your attention to demi-sec champagne? Where champagne brut contains less than 12g sugar per litre, demi-sec has between 32g and 50g (there’s also a growing trend for similar products inEnglish sparkling wine). A glass of this will do very nicely alongside lemon tarts, pavlovas or anything with fresh fruit that you might serve post-lunch.Four bottles that are made for dessertsCockburn’s LBV£17 Ocado, 20%. A late-bottled vintage port that, alongside a slab ofToblerone, will hit the festive nail on the headMorrisons The Best Pedro Ximénez£10.50 (50cl) Morrisons, 16.5%. I’vealwaysgot a bottle of this in the fridge over the festive period. Fig and raisin notes make this a fab match for Xmas pudding.Domini Veneti Recioto Della Valpolicella 2022/23£19 (£17 on mix-six) Majestic, 12.5%. Dried red fruits and a hint of vanilla pod.Muscat de Rivesaltes Domaine Bertrand-Bergé 2024£15.50 The Wine Society, 16%. Great value rivesaltes.
