As head of JP Morgan’s private bank, he would be in charge of a sprawling team that managed money and investments for some of the world’s richest people.Among them was the mysterious but well-connected billionaireJeffrey Epstein, with whom he would quickly develop a “fairly close professional relationship”.Staley was soon holidaying on Epstein’s private island, flying on his private plane, and gaining access to an impressive portfolio of ministers, entrepreneurs and royalty. The relationship ended up bolstering Staley’s profile on Wall Street and even connecting his daughter to senior figures at Ivy League universities.It also helped to end his career.In July 2019, Epstein was arrested on child sex trafficking charges, accused of sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of girls at homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida. Some victims were as young as 14, US prosecutors alleged. Epstein, who was in jail as he awaited trial,was found dead in his prison cellweeks later.The revelations about Epstein led to a media storm, bringing renewed attention to his former friends and business associates, including Staley. Barclays told theFinancial Conduct Authorityin October 2019 that the pair “did not have a close relationship” and were last in contact “well before” Staley took over as chief executive four years earlier.But a subsequent FCA investigation, involving a cache of 1,200 emails fromJP Morgan, convinced the regulator it had been misled. It alleged that the pair were indeed close friends and stayed in touch via Staley’s daughter for years after he joined Barclays.View image in fullscreenJes Staley arrives at 10 Downing Street in January 2018.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/ReutersIt was not Staley’s first run-in with the FCA, having been fined £642,000 for trying to unmask a whistleblower in 2018. It was, however, the final straw: he was issued a fine of £1.8m and banned from holding senior management roles in the City in 2023, leading to him losing about £18m worth of pay.The 68-year-old fought back inan appeal this spring, arguing that he had always been transparent with Barclays and had followed internal legal advice on the letter’s phrasing, which was meant to emphasise that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes. Judgeson Thursday ruled in the FCA’s favour, upholding the lifetime City ban.March’s two-week tribunal hearing in London also gave the first public account of Epstein’s role in Staley’s life. This is what the court heard.The pair did not meet by chance, but on the recommendation of JP Morgan’s then chief executive, Douglas “Sandy” Warner, who felt that Epstein – already a client – was someone the newly appointed head of the private bank should know.The pair “got on well”, according to Staley’s lawyers, and Epstein’s career-boosting potential quickly became clear. He would refer wealthy friends to Staley, many of whom turned into JP Morgan clients.The two men occasionally socialised, Staley said, explaining that he would sometimes swing by Epstein’s home in Manhattan for a drink or dinner. And, from 2005, he took his family on the first of a handful of trips to Epstein’s Caribbean island, Little St James.Staley was adamant that Epstein was never part of his inner circle, was never invited to the family home, any “milestone birthdays”, or “personal meals in restaurants”. Staley said he had few personal friends and remains a loner. “From what I recall, Jes didn’t have very many friends,” his former chief of staff Sasha Wiggins told the court in March.And Staley said parts of Epstein’s life always remained a mystery. “I really didn’t know how much money he had,” Staley said. “What his background was, was always sort of shrouded.”View image in fullscreenOne of Jeffrey Epstein’s properties on his private island, Little St James, US Virgin Islands.Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersBy 2006, the mask started to slip. Epstein was arrested after police in Florida were tipped off that he was recruiting young girls for massages and sexual encounters. He pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor and in 2008 he was sentenced to 18 months in jail.Staley stayed in contact, though, and visited Epstein after his indictment. He said Epstein did not deny that he solicited a prostitute, but maintained that he thought the girls were over 18. “Obviously he lied to me,” Staley told the court in March.He visited Epstein again in around 2009, when he was on a prison work release programme in Florida. Staley said he reported the visit to JP Morgan, which was reviewing whether to keep Epstein as a client.But emails suggest he had been leaning on the imprisoned Epstein for advice throughout the financial crisis, writing in October 2008: “I am dealing with the Fed on an idea to solve things. I need a smart friend to help me think through this stuff. Can I get you out for a weekend to help me (are they listening?).”View image in fullscreenJeffrey Epstein in a photo taken in 2017 for the sex offender registry in New York.The court heard that Staley turned to Epstein to help connect his daughter – a physics major – with scientists and senior professors at Ivy League universities. The financier, who Staley referred to as “Uncle Jeffrey”, would later be invited to her graduation in 2015. Staley stressed that he did not then know of Epstein’s crimes.Wiggins told the court: “Mr Staley said to me once: ‘Why would I have introduced my wife and daughters to Mr Epstein if I thought he was a paedophile?’”When Epstein was released on house arrest in July 2009, Staley was one of the four people he emailed to say: “Free and home.” Staley replied: “I toast your courage !!!!!”But more cryptic messages between the two stirred the most controversy, including an exchange about Disney princesses in July 2010. “That was fun. Say hi to Snow White,” Staley wrote. “What character would you like next?” Epstein asked, to which Staley replied: “Beauty and the Beast.” “Well one side is available,” Epstein responded. Staley told the court he was not able to explain the exchange.Months earlier, in September 2009, Epstein emailed a woman to say: “Jes staley is staying at the berkeley hotel in London tonight.” Staley said he could not recall the reason behind the message.That year Staley’s career took another leap, with his promotion to lead JP Morgan’s investment bank. Even the chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was singing his praises,telling Fortune magazine: “Jes has impeccable character and integrity.”View image in fullscreenJeffrey Epstein with the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.Photograph: Zuma Press/AlamyThe new role meant Epstein was no longer a direct client. But that did not end their relationship, or Staley’s effusive messages.In November 2009, Staley detoured from a work trip to visit Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, replete with a 26,700sq ft mansion, private airstrip, and seven-bay heated garage. He emailed Epstein in thanks: “So when all hell breaks lose [sic], and the world is crumbling, I will come here, and be at peace. Presently, I’m in the hot tub with a glass of white wine. This is an amazing place … I owe you much. And I deeply appreciate our friendship. I have few so profound.”In December, months after Epstein’s release, the pair finally found time to meet in person. “I realize the danger in sending this email. But is [sic] was great to be able, today, to give you, in New York City, a long heartfelt hug. To my friend, Thanks. Jes.”At times, their emails were more explicit: discussing sex scandals and lovers. One message, sent from a debutante ball that Staley attended in November 2010, told Epstein that Staley had seen “your lover … she says u slept with her!!”Epstein separately sent photos, one of which was of a woman in a low-cut ballgown. “You were with Larry, and i had to put up with …,” Epstein wrote.When FCA lawyers suggested this interaction was a sign that he and Epstein were “personally close”, Staley said such behaviour was not uncommon between people who were “professionally close – you know, if you’ve ever worked on a trading floor on Wall Street”.Staley said there were parts of his life he kept from Epstein, includinghaving sex with a member of Epstein’s staff. “Oftentimes I would go to Epstein’s apartment and he would be late, and she and I got the chance to know each other.” This led to sexual intercourse, he said, “much to my embarrassment today”.The former banker, who has a wife and two daughters, said the confession came at a personal cost. “I have been honest such that I have put my marriage at risk … I have never shied away from telling the truth about all of this.”The date of the encounter was not disclosed in court, but the FCA revealed that Epstein’s former employee had “carved” Staley out of a settlement she had reached with Epstein’s estate. “I was not aware of that,” Staley told the court.Despite the allegedly secret encounter, Epstein and Staley would send messages declaring their close ties, referring to each other as family. In one exchange in March 2011, Epstein writes: “Told you −−−− family.” Staley replied with one word: “Family”.Behind the scenes, Epstein’s banking relationship with JP Morgan was starting to unravel.The bank was considering dumping Epstein as a client but was careful about broaching the issue with Staley, saying they were friends. “He needs to understand the potential backlash to the firm given all the work done to root out clients involved in human trafficking,” an internal memo said.View image in fullscreenJes Staley leaving court in March 2025 following the first day of his tribunal appeal.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/ReutersStaley tried to convince the bank’s top lawyer to “hear [Epstein] out”, according to a JP Morgan meeting note. He also revealed to Epstein that his transactions were under review. Staley admitted to sharing internal information with Epstein but denied having pushed the bank to keep him as a client.Panic had set in by September 2009, when Epstein told Staley a “family meeting was required”. Epstein was concerned about an “abusive reporter”, and instructed Staley on how to respond: “I think your response should be [that] all of the incidents that they raise happened a decade ago, I paid my debt and like everyone else should be given another chance.”Epstein said he had been “unaware of the full heat that you have taken as a result of our friendship”, adding: “I’m sorry.”Epstein hired a London lobbyist for a 2012 campaign to make Staley Barclay’s chief executive, dubbed “Project Jes”. In emails, the lobbyist claimed he hoped to convince top-level policymakers, including George Osborne, who was the then chancellor, and Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, to support Staley. The banker said he never knew about the push.Barclays ultimately installed its ownhead of retail and business banking, Antony Jenkins, whose ousting three years later led to Staley’s leadership.In early 2013, Staley left JP Morgan, moving to the hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital. At this point, Staley claimed, his relationship with Epstein started to decline.But the FCA alleged that their communication did not wither, pointing to a string of emails in early 2013 in which the pair discussed dinner plans, new work phone numbers and planned meet-ups. Staley also kept up an annual tradition of emailing Epstein on New Year’s Eve.The declarations of friendship continued in January 2015, when Staley told Epstein: “The strength of a Greek army was that its core held shoulder to shoulder, and would not flee or break, no matter the threat. That is us.”That year, Epstein was back in the media’s crosshairs. An anonymous woman hadfiled a lawsuit alleging she was repeatedly sexually abusedby Epstein between 1999 and 2002, and that he had loaned her out to rich and influential men.By April that year, Staley had what he says was his last in-person meeting with Epstein, having again taken his family to visit the financier’s private island. “Thanks for the flight and thanks for the lunch. Your place is crazy, and special … I count u as a deep friend. The girls seemed to enjoy the sail. All the best Jes.”Within months, Staley was taking another stab at theBarclaysjob, and kept Epstein abreast of developments. Weeks before the appointment, Staley emailed: “Cross your toes !!!”Staley was back in touch days before receiving his Barclays contract: “We’re very close.”The British tabloids, however, were circling, having already pounced on another prominent figure with ties to the convicted sex offender.News of Prince Andrew’s relationship with Epstein had caused a media frenzyas early as 2011, years before a disastrous BBC interview that led to the prince being forced to step back from public duties in 2019.Days before Staley was confirmed as Barclays’ new boss, the Mail on Sunday was chasing up claims that Epstein lobbied Barclays to hire Staley in both 2012 and 2015. Epstein forwarded the newspaper’s queries to Staley, who later replied: “Ok. I’m going to play is [sic] simple. I’ve known you as a client. I will tell B tomorrow. Let me know if they say something else. But stay away from them. I’m fine.”The article was published with the headline: “Andrew’s billionaire paedophile friend secretly backed new Barclays boss for job”.Staley said he cut contact with Epstein days later, following “strong advice” from Barclays. “I telephoned Mr Epstein and told him that we could not ever again have communication, which he accepted. The relationship ended there. I have had no communication with him since then,” Staley told the court.There is no evidence of direct contact between the two men after October 2015, but the FCA alleged they stayed in touch via Staley’s daughter until at least February 2017.Emails show that Epstein asked Staley’s daughter to ask the newly installed chief executive’s opinion on other bankers, to try to connect Staley with royalty in the Middle East, and to ask whether Staley was interested in a post with the US Treasury. Staley said he did not recall any of those conversations, and he did not realise at the time that his daughter and Epstein were still corresponding.The tribunal on Thursday raised concerns in its judgment about Staley’s evidence, saying he “could be inconsistent in his answers when he felt that it would suit his case”, adding that he had “shown no remorse for his conduct”.Judges have sided with the FCA, upholding its City ban and scuppering efforts to restore his reputation.And while the tribunal reduced his fine from £1.8m to £1.1m, this was to reflect pay he lost from Barclays as a result of the FCA ruling. It is not clear how much Staley has paid in legal costs trying to challenge the UK regulator.Staley said in a statement: “I am disappointed by the outcome and the time it took for this process to play out – that was entirely beyond my control. As the tribunal accepted, I was never dishonest. It took years of arguing with the authority and until November 2024 to establish that fact, and it took more time for the financial penalty to be reduced by 40%.“I have worked tirelessly for my prior employers for the entirety of my career. I am proud of the support I gave to many individuals during that career and the strategy I developed to help Barclays when it faced immense challenges. The tribunal recognised what they described as ‘my long and distinguished career’.”Explore more on these topicsJes StaleyJeffrey EpsteinBarclaysJP MorganFinancial Conduct AuthorityFinancial sectorBankingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The men of Kafr Malik had run to its south-western edge to form a screen against the settlers and rescue women and children trapped in a house set alight by the masked attackers.Israeli forces kill three Palestinians after settlers attack West Bank townRead moreBut as they threw stones at the settlers in an attempt to drive them back, theIsraelarmy, who had taken up position behind the marauders, opened fire at the Palestinians.“Their own kids are really valuable to them but other people’s kids are worthless,” said Mohammed Sabry, his eyes swollen from a night of weeping. His 18-year-old son, Lutfi, was one of the dead.“There is no justification whatsoever to shed the blood of the Palestinian people like this,” Sabry said. “They attack us without provocation, and when the young people go to defend women and children, they are shot by the army. The bitter truth is that the world is watching the bloodshed of the Palestinian people without doing anything about it.”Afi Hamayel has the misfortune to own a house on the south-east edge of town and it took the brunt of the settler attack. “They threw petrol bombs into my car and then through the window into the house,” Hayamel said as friends helped him remove charred personal effects from the house.View image in fullscreenA burnt car after the attack by Israeli settlers in Kafr Malik.Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersHamayel’s extended family, including his own six children – 20 people altogether – had taken shelter in the house as the attack began. When it began to burn, a neighbour ran down the hillside to help them escape.“He was helping me evacuate the children. He took them to his house and he was coming back when the army shot him in the head,” he said. The neighbour, 35, was listed as one of the three killed on Wednesday.The settlers sprayed a black message on the wall around Afi Hamayel’s house, declaring the attack to be revenge for the killing two years ago of two settlers in Eli, a settlement about 9 miles (15km) to the north.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed they came under fire from the direction of Kafr Malik on Wednesday night. But that was adamantly denied by residents, the IDF produced no evidence, and there were no reports of any injuries among the settler assailants.West Bank mapFive settlers who took part in the attack were detained. According to press reports and human rights activists, they were released without charge early on Thursday morning.In Kafr Malik, a billowing brown and black tent was erected alongside the central mosque for the wake, with long lines of green plastic chairs lined up for the mourners, who arrived on foot from all corners of the town.Palestinian flags hung along the surrounding streets alongside the yellow banner of Fatah, the main faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. It was an exercise in branding, showing Kafr Malik’s continuing loyalty, despite the attacks, to the Palestinian Authority (PA), in which Fatah is the dominant force. It signalled that this town, at least, had notgone over to Hamas.The Fatah banner is emblazoned with motifs of its past resistance, crossed assault rifles over a grenade, but the defiant symbolism was drained of meaning long ago.Kafr Malik is about 8 miles north-east of Ramallah, the seat of the PA, but it lies in Area B, which means the PA is supposed to provide civil governance while the IDF is responsible for security. Palestinian police have no jurisdiction there. Even in Area A, where they are in charge, they do nothing to protect Palestinians from outside attack.More and more over recent years, it has become open season on Palestinians in theWest Bank, who have been killed with impunity. Through the Gaza war, the Lebanon war and now the Iran war, the death toll among Palestinians on the West Bank keeps grinding upwards, in a concerted campaign to drive them off their land. Since the start of the Gaza conflict,the UN says, 943 Palestinians have been killed by settlers or security forces, more than 140 of them this year.View image in fullscreenMourners during the funeral in Kafr Malik on Thursday.Photograph: Ammar Awad/ReutersIt was the second time the mourning tent had been put up in Kafr Malik this week. On Monday a 13-year-old boy, Ammar Hamayel, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers while out with his brother in the olive groves on the south side of town. He was the 29th child shot dead by Israeli forces in theWest Bankthis year, according to the Palestinian health ministry.After the killing, the IDF put out a statement saying the boys had been throwing stones in the direction of a patrol, referring to them as “terrorists” and presenting it as a justification for shooting them dead using assault rifles.Afi Hamayel is a relative of the dead boy, part of the same large clan. He said the brothers had been out trapping birds with nets set up between trees. Hamayel is a father of four girls and two boys, and these days he does not let them go beyond the garden fence.The view from the family house looks over the Jordan valley to the distant high plateau of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on the east bank. The rocky hillside below their home is covered with olive groves that Hayamel and other townspeople no longer dare to tend, for fear of being picked off by the settlers or an army sniper.The tall antennas of an IDF base can be seen on the neighbouring hill overlooking the town, and a new settler outpost has sprung up alongside the base in the past two weeks, local residents said. Anoutpost is a settlementestablished without official authorisation, though under the current, settler-dominated Israeli coalition, outposts generally receive retrospective endorsement. The settlers receive army protection from the moment they arrive.The world around Kafr Malik keeps shrinking. Last year, shepherds from the town wereambushed by settlersand their flocks were stolen. Now their olives are out of reach too. It is a commonplace tale across the West Bank.“This is what ethnic cleansing looks like,” the human rights group Yesh Din said in a statement after Wednesday night’s attack. “Under the protection of government and military backing, settler violence in the West Bank continues and is becoming deadlier by the day.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelFatahMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

To bend reality to your own worldview. To live almost entirely in the present. Where contradicting yourself is not a problem because two opposing statements can both be true. On the way toNatoyou can question article 5. On the way back you can give all the other Nato leaders a patronising pat on the head. And everyone is grateful for it.There again it also helps if you are the most powerful man in the world.Donald Trumpis not just tolerated, he is actively indulged. Prime ministers from other countries go out of their way to compete with one another in outright sycophancy. Flattery that started off as contrived now sounds dangerously sincere. Almost as if they genuinely believe it. Thank you Agent Orange for all you have done. We don’t know where we would be without you.And The Donald just laps it up. Feeds on it. At the recent Nato summit he looked like a pig in shit. Living his best life. Whatever sunbed regime he’s on, it’s working for him. If he lost any sleep over his decision to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities, it doesn’t show. Just repeat after Donald:The mission was a complete and utter successand Iran’s programme has been put back decades. If the Pentagon says otherwise, it’s just fake news. Yet again, reality can be what you want it to be.Even when Trump temporarily loses it, he wins. Swearing is generally a no-no for any leader. A sign that you’ve lost control. But when Donaldsaid Israel and Iran didn’t know what the fuck they were doing, he came out of it smelling of roses. Praised for his authenticity. Applauded for saying what the rest of the world is thinking. The Donald can do no wrong. He looks relaxed. God stand up for narcissists.Keir Starmer is no narcissist. And breathe a sigh of relief for that. The UK tried the narcissist route with Boris Johnson and that didn’t end well. Maybe we just aren’t a powerful enough country to get away with a sociopath in charge. Or, heaven forbid, maybe it was a matter of timing. Boris was the right man at the wrong time. That’s a horrible thought. Most of us would quite happily settle for a period of fairly boring politics. Where the government is serving the country rather than the ego of the person in charge. Where even when they are getting things wrong, they are at least trying to do the right thing.But that level of decency comes with a cost. Your psyche does not reward itself with a free pass. You worry about the consequences of your actions. Your toadying to The Donald. You worry about the people dying in Ukraine, Gaza, Israel and Iran. You worry when your domestic policieslook like they are falling apart. Wish you had spent more time reassuring backbenchers. Had explained better the trade-offs you were making. Had not been so quick to take a quick cash-saving win by removing benefits from people who can’t wash themselves before going to work.Keir has tried to keep a lid on all this as leaders always do. Pretend that he’s fully in charge of the situation. That everything is going according to plan. But always the tell-tale signs leak out. Starmer’s eyes betray him. They have a deadness to them, the life squeezed out. His face pasty and pallid. A man desperate for a breather, a moment to relax away from the treadmill.Yet always there is one thing more. Another summit, another speech, another bilat, another crisis at home. This wasn’t how he imagined his first year in Downing Street. The pressure and the pace is relentless. The treadmill going ever faster and there’s no getting off. He aches in the places where he used to play.Just hours after returning from The Hague, Keir was giving a keynote speech to the British Chambers of Commerce. It was one that he and they will quickly forget. A routine, box-ticking affair. An annual date, along with the CBI, in any prime minister’s diary. It wasn’t meant to be this way, mind. Starmer knows better than anyone that Labour has to work twice as hard to show that it is the party of business. But this time he couldn’t fake it to make it. He’s no visionary. He can’t access people’s hearts. Only their reason. And that only intermittently.Keir began by thanking the BCC for all it had done for the country. He knew it had been a tough year and he had asked a lot of business, but the good times were round the corner. Possibly. There was the new infrastructure strategy. Now there was also a new trade strategy which sounded very much like the old one. Which was to keep on doing the trade deals we can, as with the partial deals with the EU, US and India, and try to do some new smaller deals with other nations. The applause from the audience was barely audible. They didn’t sound desperately impressed. They can tell when a speaker is out on his feet and is phoning it in.Just over an hour later and Starmer was in the Commons for a statement on the G7 and Nato summits. Here he was much more like his chipper self. Not so much in his opening remarks about how the west was making a dangerous world safer, but in his reply toKemi Badenoch.The Tory leader just gets worse and worse. Half-witted, sulky and tone deaf. Kemikaze seemed to think the UK should no longer bother to send its prime minister to these international meetings. That Keir had only gone for the craic and to avoid her at prime minister’s questions. As if. Facing Kemi over the dispatch box was his half an hour of R&R in the week.Starmer dismissed her with barely concealed contempt as neither serious nor credible. An am-dram politician. Even the Tories were aghast. Mark Pritchard openly criticised his leader. He spoke for many on his own benches.Kemi had achieved the seemingly impossible. She had revivified a tired prime minister and united both Labour and opposition MPs against her. There is only one politician who looks a genuine leader in the Commons and it is still Starmer. He may have his hands full with a rebellion over the welfare bill, but as long as Kemi remains the leader of the opposition, he has nothing to fear from the Tories.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe politics sketchNatoKeir StarmerKemi BadenochUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

With 36 seasons complete and a renewal through a 40th secured, the show has entered territory previously occupied mostly by non-prime-time stalwarts likeSaturday Night Liveand Meet the Press – television institutions that run for much longer than the typical sitcom or drama. Perhaps conscious that the animated comedy has now lasted five to 10 times longer than a normal sitcom, the 36th season has repeatedly toyed with the idea of what a series finale might look like, even though no such thing is anywhere in sight.For the season’s premiere back in the fall, it created a fake series finale, hosted by Conan O’Brien, that featured forever-10-year-old Bart turning 11 and reacting badly to a number of finale-style abrupt changes to the status quo. And in the last episode of season 36, Estranger Things, the show flashed forward to a future where family matriarch Marge has passed away and a gradual estrangement has developed between now-adult Bart and Lisa. (Homer remains alive, with the show repeatedly underlining how unlikely it seems that he would outlive his patient, cautious and seemingly healthy spouse.)‘We jumped the shark in the very first episode!’ Thirty-five years of The SimpsonsRead moreAs fans caught up with the season on streaming, the finale has created a mild headline-generating controversy over whether Marge is “really” dead, most likely among less consistent viewers who might dip back in occasionally (or get their news about the show from the internet, rather than watching it). Of course, she’s not; Estranger Things is one of many flash-forward episodes the show has done over the years, generally understood to be alternate versions of the future, not pieces of a vast and interconnected timeline. The show’s flashbacks are similarly intentionally contradictory; early on, Marge and Homer were young parents in the 1980s; as the show got older and they stayed the same age, subsequent flashbacks were brought further and further into the timeline. None of this makes headline news, even on a slow entertainment day.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyBut one reason “Marge is dead” has seemingly caught fire as an internet curiosity may have to do with the unexpectedly mortality creeping in around the edge of the show. Anyone who has watchedThe Simpsonsin recent years, especially if they’ve seen a new episode juxtaposed with an older one, would have to take note of how different the characters sound. Animation may be able to preserve a character’s basic look and inure them from ageing (apart from the shifts in animation technique that present subtle changes in design or movement). Animation still can’t defeat, however, what the show once called the ravages of time. The Simpsons has employed a core of voice actors for nearly four decades, and who among us sound precisely the same as we did 40 years ago, if we’re so lucky to have that comparison point?Marge is the character where this is most noticeable – more so than characters whose voices have been replaced by new actors for reasons of racial sensitivity. (This just means that Black actors now play Black characters, and so on.) Those newer performers bring their own style to the character, however subtle the change. But Julie Kavner, the distinctive actor who has given one of the great long-term voiceover performances of TV history, turns 75 this year, while Marge is forever on the cusp of 40. Certain line readings will sound very close to the “original” Marge voice. More often, though, we’re getting a raspier, scratchier version that sounds more like Marge’s occasionally seen mother (also voiced by Kavner in a more whispery register). Harry Shearer, who voices more than a dozen major supporting characters including Mr Burns, Principal Skinner and Ned Flanders, also sounds deeper and older in recent years.That’s all on top of the show’s creative changes – some of which have been quite good. Under showrunner Matt Selman, the show has upped its game in recent years, actively pursuing more ambitious, format-challenging and emotionally resonant stories. Not all of them are golden-years-level funny. (Few episodes of anything are.) But the creators feel engaged with their institution, and sometimes they’ve even taken advantage of the modified vocals; in one recent holiday episode, Ned Flanders sounded genuinely grief-stricken in part due to Shearer’s inability to hit the higher range of his usual tone.Even when the actors’ changes do sound jarring, obviously it’s not anyone’s fault. People age – and IP, at least lately, seems to insist on defying that process, creating a difficult-to-resolve conflict. The show obviously isn’t ever going to permanently kill off any of the family members, but at some point, they may be in the position of hiring someone new to voice Marge, or augmenting the performance with AI. The finale already introduced a new voice for Bart’s best friend Milhouse, following the retirement of longtime voice artist Pamela Hayden. She reasonably concluded that continuing to play a 10-year-old boy well into her 70s wouldn’t make much sense.Maybe that’s why the most poignant element of Estranger Things isn’t the death of Marge, which is handled lightly, avoiding the immediate devastation of grief with just a brief cursory shot of her funeral, and ending the episode with a short scene of her happily looking down upon her family from heaven, where she clinches with longtime crush Ringo Starr. Rather, the emotional core of the episode is the sequence in which Bart and Lisa abruptly grow out of their beloved Itchy and Scratchy cartoons after realizing the show is now also marketed toward babies, with cutesy versions of the characters adorning little sister Maggie’s pyjamas. In true Simpsons fashion, this is also the funniest passage of the episode, with spot-on observations about marketing, kids’ shifting tastes in popular culture and defensiveness about liking stuff that’s for “babies”, complete with a spoof of a memorably emotional scene from Toy Story 2.Despite the show’s jokes, the idea of the Bart/Lisa bond breaking over Itchy and Scratchy, and Marge’s distress over it, is a potent one, maybe because it’s precisely the kind of uncharacteristic change alluded to in the season premiere. The Simpsons has been lampshading its ability to reset its characters for decades at this point; that’s the connective tissue between its heritage as a sitcom from another age, and as a cartoon across the ages. In Estranger Things, it’s depicting a natural process less seismic but no less constant than death: letting go of once-beloved media and the real-world habits that accompany it. Plenty of fans will have the opportunity to let go of The Simpsons, whether by chance or by choice. The show itself, good as it sometimes is, can only play at that farewell process, experimenting with what-ifs typically subsumed into the status quo.I’m not personally eager for the show to end; my daughter still eagerly watches it, and that brought me back into the newer episodes. But there does seem to be a denial of impermanence, maybe even some frustration with that, under the show’s surface. The real question isn’t whether Marge Simpson will live on, but how long the show will keep contemplating endings it can’t have.Explore more on these topicsThe SimpsonsUS televisionAnimation on TVTV comedyComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Though a lot of swimwear is made with virgin synthetic fibres, such as polyester and nylon, hearteningly, a lot of brands are now focused on using recycled materials, such as Econyl (nylon made from discarded fishing nets and other waste) and recycled polyester.While that’s a good thing, the fabric is still made of plastic, so it will shed when washed and survive long after you’ve finished front crawling in it. So buy well, buy to last and use a“Guppy” bagwhen washing to catch some of those fibres being shed.For this swimwear guide, I have scoured the internet and shops, and tried on and turned inside out a lot of different cossies. I’ve also asked friends and family of different sizes and ages what their favourite swimsuit or bikini looks like. Here is a selection of the best.The best swimming costumesView image in fullscreenAilla reversible scoop swimsuit£95 at FinisterreThis is a well-made swimsuit from the B-Corp British brand born from surf culture. This brand knows its swimwear. Made from recycled fabric and in a print that looks much prettier IRL – although it is reversible, should you prefer plain – it also has a flattering deep back scoop. Sturdy enough for a game of rounders on the beach as well as a swim in the sea.View image in fullscreenRacer back swimsuit£44 at SpeedoFrom £38.50 at AmazonMost of the people I know who actually want toswimswim would recommend a Speedo cossie. Based in Nottingham but founded in Australia, Speedo has served countless kids learning to breaststroke. It also has an illustrious heritage: moreOlympic gold medalshave apparently been won in Speedo than any other brand. This cossie also has built-in bust support, and the fabric should withstand as much chlorine and crawl as you care to throw at it. Opt for a racer back style – they really are comfy.View image in fullscreenSquare neck seersucker swimsuit£175 at Net-a-Porter£175 at SelfridgesThis is the gold standard of swimsuits for those more into lounging than lengths. First founded in the 80s, then relaunched and now Instagram-famous, Hunza G is known for its crinkle fabric, made in the Midlands. If you’ve been noticing a lot of texture creep into swimwear of late, Hunza G is the reason why. The tightly ruched seersucker is flattering, and the cuts are too. It will cost you, but then it’s not every swimsuit brand that can count Rihanna as a fan. Plus, the quality means this one’s here for a long time, not just a good time.View image in fullscreenAllegrarecycled swimsuit£57 at SmallableMade from recycled polyamide and available in orange or royal blue – both brilliant, both peppy – this swimsuit from Canopea is just the right amount of pretty. Plain but for the frilly straps, it’s made by a French brand that manufactures in Portugal.View image in fullscreenTextured bow tie swimsuit£57 at & Other Stories£57 at AsosIf Hunza G is out of your price range, you can still find that crinkled aesthetic but at a high-street price point. This swimsuit has a flattering square neckline, is beautiful in the blue, and the design means the decorative bows on the shoulders won’t interrupt your swim.View image in fullscreenElan one-piece£143 at YouswimAgain, in the same mould as Hunza G but slightly more accessibly priced – and inclusively sized – Youswim makes excellent swimwear. This is one of several brands now doing a new kind of “stretch” sizing: Stretch I fits 6 to 16, and Stretch II fits 18 to 28. It makes buying online easier, and it’s great for fluctuating bodies, future-proofing against size changes between summers. Made in the UK, using an Oeko-Tex-certified blend of nylon and elastane, the espresso colour feels unusual in a swimsuit; the juniper is also stylish. Just make sure yousun creamyour back to avoid a circular tan line, andfollow care instructionsfor a long life.View image in fullscreenSwirl print swimsuit£65 at Whistles£65 at John LewisA one-shoulder cossie won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but I find them unexpectedly flattering. Plus, they add a hint of sophistication at a time when sun-cream grease and sticky sand make it otherwise hard to feel put-together. Made using a minimum of 60% certified recycled nylon, this one from Whistles is chic.View image in fullscreenAsymmetric ruffled swimsuit£85 at Cos£85 at H&MIf you like your asymmetry with a bit more structure, this is a pretty take from Cos. Made using recycled nylon, the ruffle detail is a good shout if you often feel self-conscious in a swimsuit, providing extra coverage while also drawing the eye. The black keeps things classic.View image in fullscreenCherryIsola swimsuit£100.80 at Smallable£140 at Array StoreOAS is a Scandinavian resort brand that started when its founder introduced espadrilles from Spain to Sweden. It makes 70s-tinged, beachy clothes beautifully, although this swimsuit is more of a timeless cut.

While it doesn’t come cheap, there’s often a bargain to be had, such as this swimsuit, which is currently half price online at Casa Raki. The Econyl recycled fabric is SPF50+, the back design is beautiful, and the colours are pleasingly off-kilter for swimwear. Plus, a seam that sits between waist and boobs is known to make legs look longer, if that appeals.View image in fullscreenLisbon one-piece£74 at OokiohSwimwear prints are often nautical, so it’s refreshing to find one decorated with farfalle and forks. The wide square neckline is flattering, though not the best if you plan to swim at speed. But for lounging and splashing about, this pasta-themed cossie from LA-based swimwear brand Ookioh is super-fun. Plus, it’s made from 100% regenerated materials.View image in fullscreenOne-piece swimsuit€76.30 (about £65) at MatonaMatona puts sustainability at the centre of what it does. Making swimwear in smallGots-certified factories in Portugal and using Econyl regenerated nylon, it’s greener than many swimsuits on offer. The cut is classic and the colour is lovely. Plus, it’s on offer. The price is in euros, but the brand does ship to the UK.View image in fullscreenNabaiji one-piece shorty swimsuit£13.99 at DecathlonIf you’re after a workhorse swimming costume on a budget, this Nabaiji one-piece with shorts is a great option.

The work of a brand better known for its size-inclusive underwear, these go from an XXS to an XXXL, and are made with recycled nylon.

One frontbencher had alreadyquit over the plans, while others were understood to be prepared to do so if agreement had not been reached.One of those leading the opposition to the bill said: “They’ve offered massive concessions, which should be enough to get the bill over the line at second reading.”Another added: “We always wanted to protect the most vulnerable, not to destroy the bill or cause the government trouble. We always hoped there would be an off-ramp, and that’s what we have now.”More hardline rebels were urging their centrist colleagues not to drop their objections, but with ministers insisting they would hold the vote on Tuesday, more moderate MPs were understood to be backing the government’s proposals. Sources said all select committee chairs were now supporting the prime minister.Downing Street declined to comment.Starmer sent his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, to lead the negotiations for much of Wednesday night and throughout Thursday, alongside the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and her chief of staff, Nick Parrott.The prime minister and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, authorised those officials on Wednesday night to offer significant concessions in an attempt to rescue the welfare reform agenda, even though it will leave Reeves having to find more money at the budget.There has been speculation fromLabourrebels that welfare concessions will cost £8bn over the three-year spending review period.The chancellor is already thought to be considering tax rises, having promised toreverse cuts to winter fuel paymentsat a cost of over £1bn. This latest reversal is likely to leave her with several billion pounds extra to find.The compromise solution would mean the cuts being applied only to new claimants, while those who already get disability payments will continue to do so.Ministers have also agreed to expand and bring forward a package of employment support measures so that £1bn will now be available for them this year, and several billion across the whole of the parliament. The government had previously promised just £1bn in this parliament, to be voted on at a later date.Liz Kendall, the welfare secretary, will promise that disability groups will be consulted on how the criteria should change in the future. Changes recommended by that process will be incorporated at later stages of the bill, possibly at committee stage.Rebels have also pushed to unfreeze the health-related element of universal credit, which is paid to those with severe long-term conditions such as a terminal illness. A House of Commons analysis shows that those claiming that benefit will lose nearly £250 by the end of the parliament as a result of the decision not to raise them in line with inflation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve got a strong Labour government with a huge majority to deliver on our manifesto commitments.”The protracted row with the parliamentary Labour party has damaged the prime minister and his chancellor, and has renewed complaints among some MPs about the influence of McSweeney in particular.Downing Street officials admit they handled the communication of the bill badly, saying they should have focused on the moral case for changing the benefit system rather than the savings it was expected to generate.Rayner’s role over the past few days highlights how important she has become as a link between Downing Street and Labour backbenchers, many of whom say they have lost trust in Reeves and Kendall.Starmer will now face a difficult rebuilding operation with many of his colleagues, having come close to a parliamentary defeat less than a year after winning a landslide election victory.The decision is the latest in a series of U-turns the prime minister has made in recent weeks, including his mid-air decision to ordera national inquiry into grooming gangsand his reversal on large cuts to winter fuel payments.The prime minister’s favourability rating has fallen to -36 since the election as he has enacted a number of controversial policies. The recent reversals are designed to bolster his flagging popularity, but some in his party worry they will end up sapping his authority instead.Labour MPs are now likely to step up their campaign to end the two-child benefits limit, something Starmer has said he wants to do but which the government has so far said is unaffordable. Estimates suggest ending it could cost the government more than £3bn a year.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerWelfareBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not just Andrew Tate, there are many subsets of Andrew Tate on social media.”Issuing a message to “young women in a troubled relationship”, John Hunt said: “Try and find the strength to extricate yourself from that, because you deserve so much better.”John called for young boys to begin receiving education about misogyny from as early as nursery.He said: “I think schools should have far more freedom to explain, get young boys to behave correctly towards women, at the earliest possible age. I mean nursery age.”John described media reports claiming Hannah and Clifford had an “abusive” relationship as “ill-informed” and “off-the-scale inaccurate”.He said Clifford “violated us and our family in the most horrific of ways, but what those stories felt like was a continued violation”.Former soldier found guilty of raping ex-partner before murdering herRead moreReflecting on her mother and sisters, Amy said: “They are the representation of all things good.“They worked hard, loved hard, had fun, travelled, went and did the things they loved, spent time with the people they loved, were kind, caring, considerate.“They don’t stop being your sisters, your mum, when they pass away. I’ll always be one of three sisters, we’ll always be a family of five.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

But hiring a new head of editorial content at American Voguedoes not mean the end of her role – rather, it is an elevation.Industry journal the Business of Fashion said the move came in response to how Wintour’s role has expanded in recent years to oversee all the titles in theCondé Nastfold, from American Vogue, otherwise known as “big Vogue”, and its eight international Vogue subtitles, as well as Vanity Fair, GQ, Wired and others, but excepting the New Yorker.“Anybody in a creative field knows how essential it is never to stop growing in one’s work. When I became the editor of Vogue, I was eager to prove to all who might listen that there was a new, exciting way to imagine an American fashion magazine,” Wintour told Vogue staff,according to the publication.“Now, I find that my greatest pleasure is helping the next generation of impassioned editors storm the field with their own ideas, supported by a new, exciting view of what a major media company can be.”Under that structure, a new head of editorial content will report to Wintour as global editorial director of Vogue. Wintour will also continue as chief content officer of parent companyCondé Nast.The announcement brings to end rumors that have swirled for years that the fashion industry’s undisputed queen might step aside at one of its most influential publications. After various attempted putsches were put down, and a moment of uncertainty during the social justice protests of the early 2020s over representation and diversity, Wintour simply accrued more power.Roger Lynch, chief executive of Condé Nast, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that Wintour has been doing three jobssince 2020and that it made sense for her to step back from American Vogue at this time. “This will enable her to make time for everyone who needs her,” he said.But stepping aside from the day-to-day running of AmericanVoguemay indicate that the Condé Nast company is at least considering succession plans for the inevitable post-Wintour era as a whole.Wintour joined American Vogue in 1988 after serving as editor of British Vogue. Her first issue on newsstands – November 1988 – featuring model Michaela Bercu wearing a pricey Christian Lacroix sweater and $50 Guess jeans caused a stir about what comprised “high fashion”.The answer came with the rise of the supermodels, the arrival of grunge and more. Wintour also transformed Vogue’s cover stars, going between models and celebrities from Oprah Winfrey, Madonna, Ivana Trump, Renée Zellweger, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford and Kim Kardashian.‘Every minute at Vogue felt like an emergency’: Devil Wears Prada author Lauren Weisberger on igniting a scandalRead moreHer reputation for power was enhanced by a Hollywood film, The Devil Wears Prada, that no other fashion figure could match, as well as a slew of documentaries, including The September Issue. The Devil Wears Prada, starring Meryl Streep as a fictionalised version of Wintour, cemented her image as an icy perfectionist of immense power in the fashion world.Wintour also spearheaded the transformation of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s annual Costume Institute fundraiser to become fashion’s equivalent of Oscar night for the movie business and further turned it into a money-spinner both for the Costume Institute and for the magazine. Each year, the great and good of the celebrity world attend the Met gala, which is beamed around the world and famed for its sartorial excesses.One of the magazines under Wintour’s care in the Condé Nast empire – celebrity and culture bibleVanity Fair– recently hit the headlines after Wintour choseMark Guiduccias its new top editor.Vogue alum Guiducci, 36, will start as the magazine’s global editorial director on 30 June. He takes over fromRadhika Jones,who leaves after more than seven years at the helm. Guiducci was seen as being close to Wintour and a core part of her inner circle.Explore more on these topicsAnna WintourVogueCondé NastConsumer magazinesMagazinesNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

The number of formal suspects is expected to rise.More than 900 post office operators were prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 because of faulty Horizon accounting software that made it look as though they had been committing fraud.The scandal, widely considered to be the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history, was the subject of the critically acclaimed ITV dramaMr Bates vs The Post Office, which aired last year and thrust the scandal into the national spotlight.The government introduced unprecedented legislation in March 2024 to exonerate people who had been wrongly prosecuted.According to the latest official figures, just over £1bn has been paid out in compensation to more than 7,300 claimants across the four redress schemes up to 2 June.View image in fullscreenProtesters stand outside the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London. They say compensation for the victims of the scandal is being distributed too slowly.Photograph: Kirsty O’Connor/PAA second phase of the police inquiry, which is being developed concurrently, is looking at “wider offences” and decision-makers involved more broadly at the Post Office, as well as Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon accounting software.Since December,when the police last gave an updateon the progress of the nationwide taskforce of 100 officers and staff, the number of documents being reviewed has ballooned from 1.5 million to 6 million.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two in late 2021, one in late 2024 and most recently one in early 2025. Formally identifying a suspect and preparing to question them takes a significant amount of time due to the volume of material and inquiries necessary, so these numbers will continue to rise as the team’s work progresses.”The police, who began the Operation Olympos investigation in 2020 and by May last yearhad become a team of 80, have previously said that prosecutions are not expected to reach trial until 2027.No decisions on charges will be made until the publication of Sir Wyn Williams’ two-year public inquiry into the Post Office and the Horizon IT scandal, the first part of which is due to be announced in the second week of July.The overall investigation will look at the actions of executives, investigators, managers, legal teams as well as executive oversight by the board and civil servants.The police said that they were not conducting a reinvestigation of the wrongful prosecutions. “The offences under investigation are against the Post Office,” the said in a statement.Clayman added: “We all have a personal commitment to this investigation which goes far beyond documents and evidence. It is about the thousands of lives the Post Office Horizon scandal has impacted and we remain focused on our goal of securing justice for those affected.”Explore more on these topicsPost Office Horizon scandalPost OfficeCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Heart problems led to 257,000 years of lost productivity that year, while diseases of the digestive system caused 123,000 lost years and breathing conditions 85,000 years.Michelle Mitchell, CRUK’s chief executive, said: “Cancer has an immeasurable impact on patients and their loved ones. But this report reveals there is also a significant economic cost. Behind the figures in this report are real people – friends, family and co-workers – whose lives are being cut short by cancer. Through improving cancer survival, we can also have a positive impact on our economy.”The findings come as ministers wrestle with how a record 2.8 million people across the UK are too sick to work amid a sluggish economy.The charity reached its conclusions by subtracting the person’s age at death from their expected age of death. They then calculated the economic value of the years of life lost to cancer by estimating that person’s total expected earnings and measuring how much of those were lost.Deaths from lung cancer cost the UK more than any other form of the disease – £1.7bn. Those from bowel cancer cost £1.2bn while breast cancer fatalities cost £800m.Those are the three cancers that cause the largest number of deaths from the disease at the youngest ages, which leads to the most productive life years lost. They also cause more deaths in men than women which, because men on average earn more than women, results in a larger financial loss.Cancer deaths among people under the age of 50 lead to the annual loss of 119,000 lost years of productive life and a £3.2bn loss for the economy, the survey found. Those 119,000 lost years were from 5,900 people aged 15 to 49 dying in 2021.Among 50- to 64-year-olds the toll is even higher – 167,000 lost years per year, costing £5.1bn.David Finch, the assistant director of the healthy lives team at theHealthFoundation thinktank, said: “CRUK’s findings are a sobering reminder of the increasing rising cost of ill health and disability in the working-age population, which is becoming ever more apparent.“This issue is not going away with aprojected 25% increasein the share of working-age people with diagnosed major illnesses by 2040.”More people are being diagnosed with cancer and dying from it than ever before, mainly because of the ageing population and the impact of obesity.There were 140,000 deaths a year from cancer between 1975 and 1977. The figure rose to 176,000 a year during 2023-25. CRUK says that on current trends it will increase to 208,000 deaths a year by 2038-40.Finch said planned benefit cuts would hamper the government’s ambition to get more people well enough to start working again. “The government’s approach to tackling this is too short-term, with planned cuts to disability benefits likely to worsen people’s health and reduce their employment chances.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said its 10-year health plan, being published next week, “will set out how we will utilise the latest technology and techniques to improve cancer outcomes and transform care to give more families hope in the face of this devastating disease”.“This includes rolling out DIY screening kits for cervical cancer, more radiotherapy machines in every region and opening more community diagnostic centres closer to where people live,” they said. “We are also making progress in tackling some of the biggest causes of cancer, including our landmark tobacco and vapes bill to create the first smoke-free generation, and restricting junk food advertising to tackle obesity.”Explore more on these topicsCancerHealthEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s just that we do see, by far and away, the highest rates [of self-harm and suicidal ideation] in young women.”There was no evidence of over-reporting of mental health conditions, she added. “I don’t see this as reflecting over-identification or over-reporting, although there is greater awareness and less stigma. There’s no evidence from our data to indicate over-reporting, but in the past there may well have been under-reporting.”Graph of mental health conditions in women of different agesMore people with mental ill health are getting treatment, the study also shows, with nearly half (47%) of 16- to 74-year-olds with common mental health issues having therapy or medication for anxiety, depression, panic disorder, phobias or OCD, up from previous surveys. But most people who experience gambling harms have never received gambling-specific treatment or support, the survey found. And overall, more than half of people with common mental health conditions are not getting the help they need, experts said.Marjorie Wallace, the chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said: “This report exposes the huge scale of need facing a system that is already in breakdown, particularly involving the services available to young people.”It comes as the health secretary, Wes Streeting, is set to announce that mental health patients will be able to self-refer for talking therapies using theNHSapp. He said the government was “putting digital front doors on mental health services for patients up and down the country”. He also confirmed that 85 new mental health emergency departments would be built across England.Dr Sarah Hughes, the chief executive of Mind, said: “The nation’s mental health is deteriorating and our current system is overwhelmed, underfunded and unequal to the scale of the challenge. After the trauma of the pandemic, the relentless cost of living crisis and persistent racial inequalities, it is no surprise that mental health has suffered – especially for the young. But it is unacceptable that services still aren’t meeting people’s needs.”Graph of rising rate of self-harm in men and womenClaire Murdoch, NHS England’s national director for mental health, said: “Being in poor mental health not only affects people’s personal lives but can have a huge impact on employment and physical health. I’m pleased to see that the expansion and digital transformation of our services is supporting more people, with services like NHS talking therapies – which you can now self-refer to and be seen online – helping people access support to do the everyday things others may take for granted.“We know more needs to be done to increase access to care and we are working closely with the government on the upcoming 10-year health plan to create better mental health services for patients and reach more people, as part of the wider social shift we need to see in how we tackle mental health.”Dr Lade Smith, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “Now more than ever, we need urgent and sustained investment in the mental health workforce and infrastructure. The rising demand is clear. We must match it with a system that is given the required resources to respond with compassion, speed and fairness.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthHealthNHSEnglandYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

A backlash against it has also been growing, and many of Europe’s leaders have opposed even talking about it.Jamaica’s culture minister, Olivia Grange, said her government was asking the council to consider whether the forced transport of enslaved Africans to Jamaica and their subsequent enslavement was lawful, and if it constituted a crime against humanity.It is also calling on the council to examine whether Britain is “under an obligation to provide a remedy” to Jamaica, not only for slavery but also for its enduring consequences.“We will be submitting a petition to His MajestyKing Charles IIIto refer to the privy council a set of questions that we want answered within his current position as head of state of Jamaica,” Grange said in the Jamaican parliament on Tuesday.Nicola Diggle, an expert in privy council appeals at London law firm Blake Morgan, said the monarch could refer any matter to the council. Lower courts in countries such as Jamaica, where the council is the final court of appeal, can also refer cases.However, it may decide the matter is unsuitable for its opinion.The legal weight of the council’s recommendations can vary. They could either be treated as a court judgment or non-enforceable legal opinions.King Charles expressed deep sorrow over slavery in a speech to Commonwealth leaders in 2022 but Britain, like other former colonial powers, has so far rejected demands for reparations.The petition comes afterJamaica’s government presented a bill in December to ditch the king as head of state.Explore more on these topicsJamaicaKing Charles IIISlaveryReparations and reparative justiceAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Every day brings atorrent of unimaginable horror. It used to be weeks between disasters, now we’re lucky to get hours.For many, the only sane solution is to stop reading the news altogether – advice often shared by therapists, self-help books andeven newspaper articles.But to bury your head in the sand untilthe day the apocalypse arrivesat your doorstep is not necessarily the most tranquil, nor moral, of postures. In the sprawling Reddit communityr/collapse, people instead try to stare unblinkingly at the unravelling of civilization. For the roughly half a million members here, many of whom joined in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic and two Donald Trump inaugurations, the arc of history feels more like a freefall.This June, r/collapse was busy discussing the developing conflict between Iran and Israel, as well as“wet bulbs”(a far more humid and deadly type of heatwave), themillions of air conditionersbeing bought in India as temperatures rise andTrump’s plan to end Fema.Almost half of the members, when asked when they think collapse is going to happen, said that it’s already happeningAnonymous r/collapse moderatorBut one of thetop poststackled a more specialist topic: declining levels of phytoplankton in the North Atlantic. “As if the North Atlantic fisheries wasn’t in bad enough shape from overfishing of cod, now the base of the entire food chain has observed to be getting smaller each year for the past 60 years,” the poster wrote. A commenter added: “Ocean acidification/die off is terrifying. Even if we solve all the other collapse problems (and we almost certainly can’t) the oceans dying means the atmosphere becomes depleted of oxygen and poisonous. If humans survive those scenarios, life on Earth would more resemble that of a moon colony.” Much informed panicking ensued.There are lots of places on the internet, and especially onReddit, that collate news stories around a theme: r/UpliftingNews, r/LateStageCapitalism and r/nottheonion (which posts news so ridiculous it seems like satire) to name a few. But r/collapse is much more than a collation of links for people to feel outraged and nihilistic or warm and fuzzy about. What’s striking is the clear-eyed, unemotional tone in which posts are written: neither pessimistic nor hopeful, just peering through the window at a relentless decline.“We are not an activist subreddit,” one moderator, a retired history teacher, told me. “We filter out people who want to organize and protest. We are also not inclined towardsaccelerationism, we’re not seeking doom. We accept that perhaps it’s going to happen, but it’s not a conspiratorial subreddit. It’s basically logic, rational and scientific.”View image in fullscreenFirefighters work to put out wildfire in Tryon, North Carolina, on 3 March 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThat is thanks in part to r/collapse’s 30 fairly active moderators – among them neuroscientists, environmental scientists, chemical engineers, government auditors and history teachers – who intensively maintain the subreddit as relatively objective a resource as possible. They even have a separate page, called r/collapse_wilds, for posts removed by the moderation team, usually because they did not provide high quality enough evidence. When a new moderator applies, the existing group screens them for mental health issues and ability to handle consistently distressing content, as well as overt political bias.It might sound like a lot of red tape to help run a subreddit, but when you realize what it takes to drench yourself in fatalistic topics day in, day out, you start to understand that a collapse moderator is a special kind of person.I spoke with 10 such moderators on a video chat, just as the national guard and marines were sent to quell Ice protests in Los Angeles. All are men based in North America, polite and turn-taking, though most insisted on remaining anonymous so their online roles wouldn’t interfere with their real world positions. In their roles, they take theexistential questionsof civilization collapse seriously: What exactly constitutes collapse? Are we already experiencing it? Why aren’t people reacting more strongly to its likelihood, and does either humanity or technology have the ability to prevent it? Practical questions, too: where is the best place to live, the most helpful job to have, as collapse happens?The disaster preppers who were proven right: ‘We lived in the car for five days’Read moreThey wrestle with whether too much Trump news is distracting, and painstakingly debate posts about themorality of having childrenand population growth, which they say is the most controversial topic among the community. Each post from a user must come with an accompanying statement explaining why it’s related to collapse that the moderators assess; sometimes it seems more like they’re overseeing a grant application process rather than an online forum.The work is often philosophical in nature. “People say that this is one of the least religious times in human history, but I think that’s completely false,” said Etienne, a moderator who is based in Ontario with a background in cognitive science and neuroscience. “Most of us have strong, strong faith in the myth of technological progress. Most people associate thinking about collapse with pessimism because you’re questioning the orthodoxy of our modern religion, which is faith in progress. And I think once you’ve made peace with the myth that we all grew up with being scientifically false, then you go through the stages of grief, then you build some psychological resilience to live in the world.”The group says that when the media or academia write about collapse issues, they often try to end on an optimistic note, so as not to depress the reader.“It’s really hard to find a mainstream publication that doesn’t end an article about, say, renewable energy, with a section that says: ‘things are difficult but let’s have hope’ and ‘it’s just a matter of building more solar panels,’” Etienne said. He cited reports, including an impactfulstudyby Simon Michaux commissioned by the Finnish government, that say it’s simply impossible to replace energy with renewable sources at scale. “But we find there’s much less coverage of that – of using less energy and degrowth.”View image in fullscreenPeople shop for air coolers amid hot weather conditions in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India, on 20 June 2025.Photograph: Nasir Kachroo/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe moderators also say that people who are concerned about societal collapse tend to think it’ll come suddenly with a nuclear bomb or terrible pandemic. The subreddit is of a different mind. One moderator, an engineer who preferred to remain anonymous, explained the tenets of r/collapse like this: “In the long term, it’s going to be very difficult for us to maintain this very complex industrial society. We’re looking at a type of simplification of industrial civilization. I think most of our members think this is what collapse is, which is why almost half of the members, when asked when they think collapse is going to happen, said that it’s already happening.“This is the idea of catabolic collapse: that what we’re living through is a series of crises, sometimes followed by momentary resolution, but the long-term trend is downturn. It’s not going to be a sudden event that’s everything in a single day, which I think people likepreppersare more accustomed to thinking.”Every week, r/collapse puts out a special newsletter called Last Week in Collapse, a one-stop shop for everything that has gone wrong in the world. Its author is an international affairs researcher, who requested anonymity because their background might “color the reader’s interpretation of the events”. They’re not part of the moderation group, but began writing the roundup in 2021, inspired by what they had seen on the subreddit.“It was part of a process of making sense of the storm of news around us – almost a form of writing therapy,” they told me over email. “It is so easy to get lost or distracted by the next thing that we forget the big picture. So I decided to start organizing and summarizing other stories because I believed it would help other collapsologists and observers zoom out and take it all in.”It makes for a pretty brutal read.This week’s newsletter, for example, began with a newly publishedstudyof tree rings that suggested “irreversible large-scale forest loss” in the Amazon; featured a study saying climate change could reduce crop yields across the US and Europe 40% by 2100, which one scientistlikenedto “everyone on the planet giving up breakfast”; touched on counterintuitiveresearchshowing that some glass bottles contain up to 50 times more microplastics than plastic bottles or metal cans; and reported that this is “the sixth consecutive year that global peacefulness has deteriorated” per theGlobal Peace Index. These were just a few of around a hundred links.To paraphrase Trotsky: you may not be interested in collapse, but collapse is interested in youLast Week in Collapse author“Collapse is hard to deny when it’s all laid out for you every week,” says the author. Readers are now able to spend just five or 10 minutes reading one email “and be kept abreast on all the latest doom”.I ask what differentiates just bad news from a news story that is actually about collapse. “I have found that it helps to imagine likely realities for humanity, position your perspective in the future, and then look backwards for the telltale signs and milestones of future collapse,” the author says. “What factors and events will seem obvious to someone living 50 or 100 years from now? We can look back at the 1930s today and the road to WWII seems much clearer. Scientists are publishing under-appreciated studies every day, and their relevance is fairly obvious. Yet our attention lies elsewhere entirely.”A weekly roundup does seem like a useful alternative to completely ignoring society’s downfall. But if things are as bad as r/collapse believes them to be, does it do us any good to inundate ourselves with news of the end of everything? Aren’t we just increasing our personal suffering without making anything better?“Yes, I sometimes wonder about the overall mental impact of Last Week in Collapse,” says its author. “I know some people find it to be valuable, informative and even soothing. Others can’t bring themselves to read it. It’s not for everyone, and that’s fine. To paraphrase Trotsky: you may not be interested in collapse, but collapse is interested in you.”View image in fullscreenA diver swims in the Marmara Sea near Turkey, to inspect mucilage, a layer of slime that develops on the surface of the water due to the proliferation of phytoplankton, gravely threatening the marine biome, on 8 June 2021.Photograph: Yasin Akgül/AFP/Getty ImagesTo that end, the subreddit provides online mental health resources as well as a separate community,r/CollapseSupport, where people talk about their struggles. “Can’t stop thinking about the children”, “feeling completely hopeless” and “scared to death for everyone” are three recent post titles.Most of the moderators say that the thing they’ve found most helpful in dealing with the onslaught of information is moderating itself, and connecting with people who have similar concerns across the world: debating but also sharing cat photos and having meaningful discussion about how to lead a meaningful life in the end times. But they’re aware they’re not always the most fun people at a party.“I don’t want to be right about this sort of situation,” said one of the moderators, an electrical engineer from the midwest. “But if you’re open-minded and you’re considerate of sources, and you’re approaching it from a very methodical fashion, there is much cause for concern. Working through that grief was trying. I think there’s a lot of people that come to this community that maybe had my same perspective, and if I can at least help a few of those folks work through that, or come to their own peace, that adds some small iota of value to the internet space at large.”And that would be a vaguely uplifting note to end this article on, but as I’m hearing, that’s the coward’s way out. The truth is not all the people behind r/collapse feel like they’re necessarily helping.As the author of Last Week in Collapse put it to me, there’s probably no way out of the collapse: “I do not believe we will ultimately innovate or vote ourselves out of our situation. I predict humanity is in for a polluted future of climate emergencies, famines, wars and scarcity before the end of this century. And heatwaves, civil conflicts, breakdown of ocean currents, disease, poverty, overpopulation, drought and more. So I feel a certain sense of duty to inform those who are interested, but it’s probably healthier to ‘chop wood, carry water’ than to spend too much time following the world’s problems. Most people can’t really stop the machine anyway.”Explore more on these topicsRedditThe Armageddon complexSocial mediaClimate crisisUS politicsAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Except this statue is not as solid as it sounds but a photographic mural of Kentridge in horse-riding pose behind a skeletal wooden horse constructed from parts of artist’s easels with a saddle slung over its cardboard tube of a body. Kentridge mocks himself, and mocks the pretensions of sculpture. Or does he? There’s a confident, showoff brilliance to this illusion and the parallel with a previous great artist is obvious.Another sculpture, a more solid one, Goat, is a swirling tangle of lines solidified in space, capped with a goat’s head. It’s a homage to Picasso’s 1950 sculpture The She Goat. When you see Picasso’s art it’s not so much one specific work that awes you as the boundless flow of creativity that moves from one style to another in an inexhaustible, playful stream. Kentridge lays claim to that legacy here – and with justification. He is just about the only artist now who can dizzy you in a comparable way with the abundance of his creativity as his impulses dance from drawing to film to collage and back to drawing.Is this an artist – or a coffee pot? The great William Kentridge reveals the strange secret to a great self-portraitRead moreAlways drawing. In his2015 film More Sweetly Play the Dance, reality and drawing magically interweave: a silhouetted procession of real people walk and dance across a blasted landscape to jazz and African music, bearing banners and sculptures that are in fact Kentridge’s drawings. Sketches are borne aloft as if they were flags, while the carriers, too, are partly overdrawn. It’s genius.View image in fullscreenMocks himself. Or does he? … still from Self-Portrait as a Coffee-Pot, 2022.Photograph: Courtesy Kentridge Studio, © William KentridgeMore Sweetly Play the Dance, created as an elegy to victims of Ebola, is the kind of collective artwork at which Kentridge excels. This Johannesburg artist makes political art, not so much through declamatory content, as through collaborations with communities of musicians, dancers, actors. He can capture collective tragedies and span modern history. This film’s power is enhanced by being shown across multiple screens, an embracing, constantly moving panorama with sound from repurposed gramophone horns. In the same screening roomOh to Believe in Another World, his animated history of Soviet Russia, becomes an even more menacing farce than when it was recently shown ona single screen with live orchestra on the South Bank.Kentridge’s film art is, on the whole, much more compelling than his sculptures. On screen he brings it all together, animating his drawings, collages and puppets, using sound as superbly as a conductor, which makes sense. When he was three, Kentridge wanted to be an elephant, but when he was 14, his dream was to lead an orchestra.Failing in both ambitions, he became an artist.Self-Portrait as a Coffee-Pottells this autobiographical story in a series of nine films, shown on a large TV screen in a corner of a gallery that re-creates his studio – and it takes all day to see in its entirety. It should be on TV, for it is made in a documentary format with Kentridge as an authoritative “presenter”, speaking in his deep voice and soft accent, in a manner reminiscent of the great television author presenters of the past like Jacob Bronowski or Robert Hughes. Except he keeps being interrupted by his own double.The technological wizardry that enables Kentridge to debate with himself is so state of the art you see double. Both Kentridges wear his habitual white shirt and speak in the same compelling voice, but they disagree. When Kentridge One reminisces about a childhood picnic when the family ate boiled eggs and sardines on a spread-out newspaper, Kentridge Two begs to differ. “What newspaper was it?” “The Sunday Times.” “Our mother would never have spread out a newspaper for a picnic, and especially not the Sunday Times.”View image in fullscreenMovement is the essential thing … Cursive, 2020, by William Kentridge.Photograph: Thys Dullaart/© William KentridgeAs they argue, they draw, and the drawings flow exquisitely as he sketches remembered landscapes, self-portraits, still lifes.

Looking in the mirror to admire his own noble features, in a sequence inspired by the Marx Brothers’ Duck Soup, he instead sees a Black woman looking back at him. While one Kentridge says he is most himself while drawing introspectively, the other claims he is most himself working collaboratively in theatre, opera, you name it. These two facets reveal a subtle soul who moves merrily between private imaginings and public designs.Movement is the essential thing. Cinema is in every fibre of his being. He shows a series of small bronze sculptures along shelves, and it’s like a film reel. So, is freezing his images as monumental sculpture a folly, like trying to fix a childhood memory in your mind? No. These sculptures are just one more experiment for an artist who is always on the move, always ready to share. At the top of the green hill above the gallery is his huge bronze sculpture of an ampersand (&).

A message telling fans to meet her at Washington Square Park – ostensibly for a video shoot – caused chaos, happily of the variety that gets filmed on multiple cameraphones and goes viral on social media. Thousands turned up and the police shut the event down, but those that evaded them were eventually rewarded by Lorde performing to new single What Was That with impressive gusto given that she was standing on a small wooden table at the time.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Virgin.It was surprising. Lorde’s last release, 2021’sSolar Power, wasn’t the only album of that period on which a female artist who had become famous in her teens strongly suggested that doing so was a living nightmare – Billie Eilish’s Happier Than Ever and Olivia Rodrigo’s Guts did, too – but it was the only one that sounded like a resignation letter, sent from a beach in Ella Yelich-O’Connor’s native New Zealand: “Won’t take a call if it’s the label or the radio,” she sang at one point. At another: “If you’re looking for a saviour, well that’s not me.” But Solar Power turned out to be merely an out-of-office message. Four years on and Lorde isn’t just back, but apparently back in the sharp-eyed party girl mode of 2017’sMelodrama. What Was That compares falling in love to the sensation of smoking while on MDMA. “It’s a beautiful life, so why play truant?” she shrugs on opener Hammer. “I jerk tears and they pay me to do it.”The album features electronics that chatter, throb and regularly burst into fat, rave-y hands-in-the-air riffs, a high proportion of bangers to ballads and a profusion of big choruses. The ballads tend to the epic rather than introspective, with even Broken Glass, the track about the singer’s battle with an eating disorder, packing a hook you can imagine a stadium audience singing along to. In that sense, Virgin might seem like an act of consolidation – far closer to Melodrama, since hailed as a modern classic, than the understated and polarising Solar Power. But it seems infinitely more likely that Lorde has reappeared because she’s got something fresh to say rather than to reassert her commercial pop bona fides.Despite the talk of pills, dancing and promiscuity, Virgin’s overall tone is markedly different. Melodrama was an album concerned with events that happen in your late teens, from experiments with drugs to first major heartbreak. Eight years on, Virgin is haunted by a late-20s kind of angst, born of the sense that you’re now incontrovertibly an adult, regardless of whether you feel like one, or whether you’re still, as GRWM puts it, “jumping from stone to stone in the riverbed … looking for a grown woman”. On Shapeshifter, a one-night stand brings ennui and an irrational fear that such behaviour is compulsive: “If I’m fine without it, why can’t I stop?”Lorde: What Was That – videoThere’s more heartbreak, but this time it’s sharpened by the sense that the sundered relationship was meant to betherelationship: the album ends with Lorde repeating the phrase “am I ever gonna love again?”, a sentiment that also lurks around Man of the Year, Current Affairs and What Was That. It’s worth noting that the fraught subject matter is invariably leavened with self-awareness and bursts of sharp wit. On Current Affairs, a romantic depiction of love blossoming under a lunar eclipse suddenly turns earthy: “You tasted my underwear / I knew we were fucked.”Girl, so inspiring! Lorde’s 20 best songs – rankedRead moreSimilarly, despite the choruses and the euphoric riffs, the sound of Virgin is noticeably unsettled and rough. The synths are distorted in a way that makes the resultant sound feel corroded; the more ambient textures tend to gust through the songs like drafts of icy air. The melody lines are regularly disrupted by bursts of incomprehensible, mangled vocals that suddenly appear then vanish. The biggest ballad, Man of the Year, builds to a climax that’s less uplifting than panic-inducing: the weirdly clipped-sounding drums feel too loud, punching through everything else in irregular staccato bursts; the aforementioned distortion soaks everything, including the vocals; the electronics take on a punishing, industrial cast.Throughout, Lorde seems less like an artist cravenly rehashing former glories than one who began her career speaking directly to her fellow teens about stuff that mattered to them – and paving the way for Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo et al in the process – continuing to grow up alongside her fans. That’s always a tough job, but one Lorde seems more than capable of thanks to writing that remains as skilful and incisive as it did when she was precociously skewering pop’s obsession with unattainable lifestyles from an Auckland suburb in 2013. Powerful, moving, personal but universal – and packed with bangers – Virgin is the proof.This week Alexis listened toWestside Cowboy – Alright Alright AlrightA brief, frantic, bracing burst of chaotic, Pavement-ish alt-rock: feedback, guitar riffs that unravel into chaos, all over and done in just over 90 seconds.Explore more on these topicsLordeAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockElectronic musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s how I learned to shut up and listenAfter realising how much I interrupted other people, I decided I needed to make a drastic change. Here’s how starting to listen changed my relationships – and made me happierIoan Marc JonesThu 26 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTShareIlike to talk as much as the next man – and men like to talk. A now-famous study by theUniversity of California, Santa Barbara,noted that, in a series of recorded public conversations between men and women, 48 interruptions occurred, 46 of which came from men. The 2024 Women in the Workplace survey by McKinsey found that nearly 40% of women experienced being interrupted or spoken over “more than others” at work, against 20% of men.Men in public spaces, according to research,talk more than women, talk over women, and talk down to women, contributing to the rise ofgender neologismssuch as manologuing, bropropriating and mansplaining. So, aware that men tend to dominate and disrupt, aware that the world at large feels unbearably loud, aware that I, too, often add to that noise, I decided to learn to keep my mouth shut – starting in the general hellscape of social media.I have often felt compelled, on seeing an idiotic post, to point out its idiocy, as though I alone had noticed it. It’s a compulsion encouraged by the reward-based models of social media platforms. Users think of an interesting thought or response (trigger), send a post (behaviour), receive likes and re-posts (reward). Dopamine arrives as part of the feedback loop and we repeat the cycle.View image in fullscreenWithdrawal symptoms … Ioan Marc Jones.Photograph: HandoutThe compulsion to post relies onsignalling, too – and not just of “virtue”. Read through your social media timelines and, if you’re an overtalker, you’ll find insecurities. Mine read like an exposé of impostor syndrome: barely veiled attempts to appear intelligent. I seldom mentioned the football, but try to stop me posting commentary about Hamlet at the Young Vic, as though my followers were desperate for my “original” takes on Hamlet.I once live-tweeted my experience reading War and Peace just to show that I was the sort of person who read War and Peace. Life events fell victim to the social media lens. I could not simply enjoy Christmas or birthdays: I framed events in odd ways, repurposed them in pursuit of dopamine. “Books, booze and cherry blossoms,” I once tweeted, after workshopping the image and tagline with my partner on our anniversary. Nothing was sacred, nothing real, everything permitted.I’ve had social media for nearly two decades, the majority of my life. It seemed obvious that, as I slouched into my mid-30s, I needed a cleanse. I’d already deleted Facebook and Instagram. I kept X but removed all past posts, then only posted links to my writing.Deleting social apps removes any doubt thatsocial media is addictive. I experienced genuine withdrawal symptoms: a touch of irritability here, a hint of anxiety there. Small-scale Fomo washed over me, as though all the cool kids were hanging out on Elon Musk’s X. But the withdrawal symptoms soon dissipated and left me in a state of embarrassment – embarrassed by my past actions, as if I could not recognise the man I was back then, all those hours ago. The compulsion to opine on any given topic at any given time, that most universal form of entitlement, suddenly seemed a bit silly, a feeling captured by ex-overtalker Dan Lyons in his book STFU: The Power of Keeping Your Mouth Shut in a World That Won’t Stop Talking: “The world was not sitting with bated breath, waiting to hear what I would say.”I once live-tweeted my experience reading War and Peace just to show that I was the sort of person who read War and PeaceTalking less in real life proved a tougher ordeal. My family are rough around the edges, my friends are on the wrong side of unruly: the people I love seldom get to finish sentences. I have often felt that my overtalking relied on the desire to be heard, a Darwinian survival of the loudest. But communication coach Weirong Li told me that the compulsion to talk often stems from the desire to escape silence. “Most people speak to avoid discomfort – not because they have something essential to say.” That rang true: the urge to avoid awkward silences has always felt urgent.Allow me to trigger your anxiety: you’re in a lift and a co-worker you sort of know enters, or you’re at a bus stop and a distant family friend appears. I’d take the stairs. I’d walk. If I found no escape, I’d do the sensible thing: talk as quickly as possible about anything and everything until the saga mercifully ends. Last year, I saw an old mate from school walking towards me on a London street, so I dived into Sam’s Chicken. I’m a vegetarian. I stole a glance as the bloke walked past: not my mate, not even close. I bought chips and left.People who can tolerate uncomfortable silences are typically better listeners.Studies showthat embracing awkward silences improves emotional self-regulation, fosters empathy and builds trust between conversational partners. I asked a friend, Makomborero Kasipo, a writer and registrar in psychiatry, to characterise my overtalking. “You talk to fill silence,” she said. “You express yourself, which is good, but then feel the need to defend what you have just expressed, then defend that against an imagined response, then apologise for talking too much, then apologise for apologising.” Mako offered advice: learn to feel comfortable in silence. “Develop the skill to let silence breathe.”I’m still practising. Suffering awkward silences has been an odd learning curve: horrific at firstThat meant practice, embracing real-world silence despite every fibre of my British being pushing me to discuss the weather. I noticed two responses to my newfound silence: most people ranted – bless them – or I faced unimaginable awkwardness. I stood by a bus stop with my mum’s friend and lasted roughly 20 seconds until I finally broke: “Weather’s weird, isn’t it?” I said. I’m still practising. Suffering awkward silences has been an odd learning curve: horrific at first, only slightly less horrific later on, still horrific now but perhaps not as horrific.Talking less is not just about limiting the compulsion to talk. It’s also about changing the ways in which we converse. One of my main problems, according to my partner and any logical observer, wasconversational narcissism: the art of bringing every discussion back to me. I’m very good at it. Most of us are. Sociologist Charles Derber recorded more than 100 dinner conversations and found two types of reaction: the support and the shift response. The support response is the lovely one, the bread and butter of therapists, the one that builds on the initial talker’s points and draws further discussion. A New Yorker cartoon depicts the bad response, the more common response, the shift response, as a man in a blazer at a dinner party says, “Behold, as I guide our conversation to my narrow area of expertise.”Biology justifies the popularity of the shift response. Dopamine floods our brains when we talk about ourselves. Our bodies reward our narcissism. But listeners often face an altogether different physiological reaction: the production of cortisol, the fight-or-flight hormone, causes discomfort and even resentment.View image in fullscreenPractise listening … rather than talking.Photograph: AleksandarGeorgiev/Getty ImagesI started to notice my interruptions, the creative ways I managed to bring the conversation back to my favourite topic: me. I noticed how, in lieu of listening, my mind would embark on wild and weird adventures, fighting against the odds to relate everything back to my experience. My partner recalled the time that I said, to my embarrassment: “That reminds me of me.” Matt Cahill, a psychotherapist, told me that shift responses can prove profoundly damaging to vulnerable talkers. “People try to open up about their problems and find themselves interrupted with, ‘Oh wow, that happened to me once!’ followed by a tangential story, diverting from the initial intent, which was to find understanding.”Shift responses limit our capacity to listenand can harm the talker. So I aimed to alter my interactions. I leaned heavily on one of the many mantras I found in STFU: “When possible, say nothing.” My partner seemed surprised over long dinners, as I spurned the urge to interrupt, asked (hopefully) meaningful questions, and abruptly concluded self-absorbed rants, rejecting the promise of dopamine. She seemed a little unnerved, at least at first, and asked whether I was OK, whether something bad had happened. I was just listening, I said.Practise listening and you’ll stop talking. Active listening has become a buzzword, abused by droves of middle managers, corporate gurus and lifestyle coaches. Listening, to them, depends on the right sort of nod, mirrored questions and choreographed body language, always in pursuit of a goal: to make a sale, gain a promotion, secure a date, and so on. It is listening as performance. Emphasis remains on the outcome, not the process. But active listening,in its initial form, focuses on the talker. It is a skill that demands full attention, use of all the senses, the removal of obstacles to comprehension, and excavating meaning below intent.InYou’re Not Listening, Kate Murphy writes: “The ability to listen carefully, like the ability to read carefully, degrades if you don’t do it often enough.” You can get better or worse at listening. You can excel or fail. And active listening proves exhausting for the out-of-practice listener, something I sought to rectify through practice, through conscious effort during every conversation.Not talking at work proved easier. I’m a writer and editor, and a fan ofCal Newport, author of Deep Work and A World Without Email - which means I have an aversion to modern ways of working. I can’t stand rambling emails and absurd operational tautologies, meetings to discuss meetings, committees to assemble committees. I spend most of my time at work actually working, so I feel confused by companies with managers managing no one, managers who manage other managers, consultants who help the managing managers manage.Fyodor Dostoyevsky, serving time in a prison camp, said the worst form of torture was forcing people to endlessly perform a pointless task. Hyperbole, perhaps, but that’s the modern workplace, left unchecked. I’m an expert at getting out of meetings – less than a fifth of meetings are productive, after all, according to a generous survey by the Harvard Business Review – but, owing to my meeting reluctance, I tend to overcompensate in the meetings I do attend.I conducted a test: I analysed meeting transcripts to uncover how often I spoke, the duration of speech, the number of interruptions and the relevancy of my replies. The results showed that, despite asking for input, I spoke too often, interrupted on occasion, and commanded more than my share of conversation. So I’m taking action in meetings.Cahill advocates the Wait methodology, which requires posing a question to yourself before speaking: “Why am I talking?” You can talk if the answer to Wait is convincing. (The answer is seldom convincing.) “Wait isn’t about not talking,” Cahill says, “but being present enough to question whether you’re actually contributing to the moment or instinctively filling in the space.”‘Be interested, be curious, hear what’s not said’: how I learned to really listen to people  | Annalisa BarbieriRead moreI combined Wait with a tactic thatI found in STFU, “Pass the ball quickly”, which reminds the overtalker to acknowledge the previous speaker, remain concise in response, and give someone else the proverbial ball.Perhaps the greatest tactic requires only a pen and paper. In his bookAtomic Habits, James Clear suggests creating barriers to break our bad habits. Remove the TV from the bedroom, or store chocolate in a cupboard far, far away. Note-taking creates a barrier for the compulsive talker. Jot down everything you want to say during a meeting, no matter how big or small, then wait for your turn to speak, like a patient child. Before talking, review your notes to identify the points that deliver value. I assure you that few will. We are far less interesting than we assume. Note-taking provides visual evidence of overtalking, showing you all the things that you would have said, left to your own devices.I found at work, using the above tactics, along with active listening, that I minimised my contributions, but those contributions felt more valuable. And, in time, the need to talk seemed less intrusive, the urge to fill silence less urgent.Self-improvement relies on awareness of the problem and a will to counter the problem. In the case of talking less, as with most valuable pursuits, practice remains the only route to success. I have a habit of falling into old habits, but even in the short term I noticed progress. Moving away from platforms that incentivise noise and extremity, and disincentivise nuance, seems obviously beneficial. You will never regret not posting.My contributions at work have become more impactful and my appetite for collaboration has increased. My partner and I, after an initial unnerving period, in which she found my quiet vaguely haunting, now seem to communicate in more fruitful ways, largely based on my conscious use of support rather than shift responses. “I appreciate you asking more questions,” she said, to which I responded: “Do you?” I have found, in general, with friends and family and strangers, that the compulsion to talk has reduced, the itch to interrupt has lessened, the capacity to listen has grown. And the rest, as Hamlet said, and as I once tweeted, is silence.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleHealth & wellbeingMenWomenWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

History of the World: Part I (1981)“It’s good to be the king.” Brooks mixes sight gags, dad jokes and Borscht Belt standup in historical vignettes from the stone age to the French Revolution. Results are hit and miss, and the ancient Rome segment goes on for ever, but the tasteless Torquemada musical number is a scream.9. The Twelve Chairs (1970)View image in fullscreenShameless hamming … The Twelve Chairs.Photograph: Ronald GrantIn the USSR, circa 1927, an ex-aristocrat, a conman and a priest search for a missing chair stuffed with jewels. Brooks’s second film, adapted from a popular Russian novel, feels ponderous compared to the rest of his work, despite shameless hamming from Ron Moody, Dom DeLuise and Brooks himself. Frank Langella, alas, is miscast in his first film role.8. Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993)The Kevin Costner school of English heroism gets the Brooks treatment with Cary Elwes as Robin Hood, Dave Chappelle making his film debut as the outlaw’s sidekick, and a perplexing detour into The Godfather territory featuring DeLuise stroking a lizard. The laughs come fast, cheap and silly, but some of them hit the bullseye.7. Life Stinks (1991)Brooks plays the leading role in a Trading Places-adjacent morality tale of a billionaire who accepts a bet that he can survive on the Los Angeles streets for a month. This comedy about homelessness bombed, but has a winning integrity and some decent gags, such as Brooks responding to his cardboard shelter getting washed away with: “There goes the neighbourhood.”6. Silent Movie (1976)With intertitles instead of dialogue (“He is truly the lord of the winos” is my favourite) and a score comprising nothing but music and sound effects, Brooks’s meta-comedy, in which he plays a Hollywood director trying to make a silent film, is almost experimental. The celebrity cameos are cute, and Brooks’s tango with his real-life wife, Anne Bancroft, is adorable.5. Spaceballs (1987)View image in fullscreenStar quality … Mel Brooks in Spaceballs.Photograph: Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/AllstarThis Star Wars spoof arrived 10 years too late, but now seems more fun than any of the official sequels and spin-offs. You can gauge the level of humour by character names like Dark Helmet, Dot Matrix and Yogurt, but the cast (including Bill Pullman and John Candy) is game for anything, and there are some inspired postmodern gags. And hurrah! Spaceballs 2 is in development!4. High Anxiety (1977)Brooks, as the acrophobic head of the Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous, is framed for murder, menaced by pigeons and cornered in the shower (by the future director Barry Levinson) in this sporadically brilliant send-up of Alfred Hitchcock’s oeuvre. Brooks’s penchant for breaking the fourth wall reaches its apex in a scene in which the subjective camera forgets to look where it’s going.3. Blazing Saddles (1974)View image in fullscreenPriceless … Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder in Blazing Saddles.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarThis shambolic western spoof cemented Brooks’s position as the heir to crazy Hellzapoppin’-style humour in the years before Airplane! Cleavon Little plays the Black sheriff (co-writer Richard Pryor was deemed uninsurable) who takes himself hostage, Madeline Kahn does a priceless Marlene Dietrich impersonation, and the flatulent cowboys have earned their place in cinema history.2. The Producers (1967)A washed-up impresario (Zero Mostel) and a neurotic accountant (Gene Wilder) hatch a scheme to get rich from a guaranteed Broadway flop called Springtime for Hitler. Brooks, storming the barriers of good taste with his directing debut, celebrates showbiz, revels in Jewish and gay caricatures, ridicules Nazis and has since made a mint from the bona fide stage musical adaptation. “Goddag på dig!” as Ulla the Swedish secretary would say.1. Young Frankenstein (1974)View image in fullscreenImpeccable … Teri Garr, Peter Boyle, Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein.Photograph: TCD/AlamyWe’re now farther away in time from the release of Brooks’s affectionate homage than that film was from the early Universal horror titles it was spoofing. Too many highlights to list, but let’s hear it for Peter Boyle’s zip-necked monster singing Puttin’ on the Ritz; Gene Hackman’s blind hermit; the brain of Abby Normal; and Wilder, impeccable in the title role. A sweet, funny classic in its own right; we shall not see its like again. Unless Brooks announces Young Frankenstein 2, obviously.Explore more on these topicsRankedMel BrooksGene WilderComedy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Francziska has her face turned towards the boggy water; beside her, sitting inside a wheelbarrow, is her mother’s torso.In the next ambiguous image, Francziska holds her mother’s head underwater. In the another, the two float, Ophelia-like, side by side.But the Grzeszykowska in these photos is not Grzeszykowska at all: it is a silicone replica of the artist, handcrafted for the 25 photographs in her series Mama, which isnow on view at Melbourne’s Buxton Contemporary.View image in fullscreen‘All of my works are a play with the viewer’ … Polish artist Aneta Grzeszykowska.Photograph: Supplied by Aneta GrzeszykowskaIn Mama, Grzeszykowska takes on the much-fetishised effigy of womanhood – the doll – and entrusts herself into the care of her daughter, who plays with her, cares for her, and terrorises her. It’s a subversive act, taking the most hallowed of relationships – that between mother and child – and flipping it.“All of my works are a play with the viewer,” Grzeszykowska tells me from her home in Warsaw, where she lives with her husband, the artist and her longtime collaborator, Jan Smaga, their daughter, Francziska, and their coterie of pets. A cat slinks past the screen, wiping her tail across Grzeszykowska’s face.View image in fullscreen‘Who hasn’t wanted to strangle their mother, at least once?’ … Aneta Grzeszykowska’s Mama #29.Photograph: Aneta GrzeszykowskaGrzeszykowska apologises for her English, which is excellent; at times she worries she can’t communicate some of the deeper themes in her work, which I don’t notice at all. “Mama is about the relationship between mother and child,” she says. “But the viewer forgets that the real mother, me, is outside of the frame taking the pictures. You forget the person pulling the puppet strings. It becomes about what you see, not who is creating the scene.”Fourteen images from Mama are being presented at Buxton as part ofthe veil, an exhibition curated by Hannah Presley that explores memory and identity through a collection of photography, film, fibre art, printmaking and sculpture by Grzeszykowska as well as artists Hayley Millar Baker, Hannah Gartside, Glenda Nicholls, Lisa Waup and Lena Yarinkura.Grzeszykowska grew up in Warsaw and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts at a time when the city had only one private gallery, the avant garde Foksal Gallery, which was established in 1966. As she was graduating in 1999, just 10 years after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, Warsaw’s contemporary art scene was beginning to bloom. Representatives from the nascent gallery Raster came by the art school, scouting for students to represent.“It was annoying!” she says, laughing at how naive she had been. “At the time, we didn’t understand what that could mean for us as working artists. But then we saw some artists they worked with, like Wilhelm Sasnal, becoming very successful. Suddenly we could imagine a future as full-time artists, without having to do practical jobs too.”Grzeszykowska has always used her body as her medium for expression – in part, she says, for “practical reasons”. She admits she is a “control freak” and finds it easiest to work by herself.Her early works were her “way of trying to understand my place in this new world.” One way was by inserting herself into the canon of feminist art history, which she first did inUntitled Film Stills 2006, a series she describes as “a precise and truly Warsaw remake” of Cindy Sherman’s photographs. “I essentially erased Cindy Sherman from the pictures by inserting my own body. But it’s also a self-erasure or symbolic ‘art suicide’ because no one really sees me. What remains is still Cindy Sherman.” She now feels it was “quite brave”: “It was my way of saying, ‘I can be Cindy Sherman too.’ I was very young, and I wanted to be her.”View image in fullscreenGrzeszykowska’s Mama series inside the veil, at the Buxton Contemporary, the University of Melbourne.Photograph: Christian CapurroMuch of her oeuvre feels cinematic. An eerie picture from Mama, taken through a crack in the bathroom door, shows Francziska’s hands reaching towards the doll’s back and neck. But just as Hitchcock used humour to express darkness and violence, there’s something comical in the image, too. Who hasn’t wanted to strangle their mother, at least once?“I see my works as tragicomedies,” Grzeszykowska says. “I don’t want my work to be only serious or only sad. Life is already sad enough! But even in sadness, somehow there’s space for humour. That’s how we get distance, and with distance comes insight … The sadness can be funny. This constant search for perspective is part of my work, especially the existential, philosophical side. I don’t like the uncertainty of life, not knowing what comes next. But when I use that feeling in my work, I regain some control over it. It becomes a strategy, a way of coping.View image in fullscreenAneta Grzeszykowska’s Mama #34.Photograph: Aneta GrzeszykowskaThe life of an artist is a privilege, she says: “There’s this special thing about art, at least from my perspective: if something is really difficult in your real life, it can actually become very good for your work.”The veilruns from 27 June until 1 November at Buxton Contemporary, Melbourne; entry is free.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyExhibitionsMelbourneArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They say the great priority of humanity should be to colonise Mars. That’s not just mad, it’s dangerous.“It encourages the notion that Earth is temporary and expendable, that we don’t need to cherish and protect it because we can just move on. In reality Earth is the only place where humanity can thrive. The problem is, we’re trashing it.‘Curate your own Glastonbury’: the BBC team bringing festival into millions of homesRead more“If Musk and Bezos really want to live on Mars, fine, go for it, do it. Just don’t expect the rest of us to come with you. That’s why we’ve built a rocket at Glastonbury so we can send them to Mars while we party on Earth.”Gideon Berger and Stephen Gallagher, the duo behind Block9, said: “Led By Donkeys are national heroes. They consistently call out bullshit on behalf of the people of the UK. Their activism sits perfectly alongside Block9’s own values and we are delighted to work with them on this collab.“Seeing as the tech bros are so keen on Mars, it seems only fair to help them get there. Our installation captures the moment when we wave off our least favourite public figures to a far and distant red planet. Goodbye for ever, Elon.”Led By Donkeys explained why they chose the festival for their latest installation. “Glastonbury is a pretty special place,” they said. “It has enormous cultural heft. Even if you’ve never been, you probably have a Glastonbury moment you remember. It’s a place where artists feel free to come and say something and despite what some commentators would have us all believe, it still has a radical edge.”A series of mugshot-style images of Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg complete the work, each clutching a placard.View image in fullscreenLed By Donkeys started by flyposting over billboards and posting its work on social media.Photograph: Phil Fisk/The ObserverThis year’s Glastonbury festival, renowned for its activism, is expected to be politically charged against the fraught geopolitical backdrop.The Irish-language rap trio Kneecap have drawn controversy over alleged statements they made concerning Gaza. One of the members has been charged with a terror offence and senior politicians,including Starmer, have said they should not be performing at the festival.“The right gets terribly exercised about what it calls ‘cancel culture’ but the single most policed and punished area of commentary is around Palestine,” Led By Donkeys said. “Kudos to Glastonbury for not canning the Kneecap slot despite huge pressure, including from the prime minister. Starmer’s got a country to run, yet there he is telling us all who should and shouldn’t be allowed to play the West Holts stage. It’s nuts.”Led By Donkeys started by flyposting over billboards and posting its work on social media. Within weeks, it had raised hundreds of thousands of pounds from donations, and became more ambitious in its messaging. Among its most well-known action was the lowering of a remote-controlled banner reading: “I crashed the economy” behind Liz Truss in the middle of an onstage talk voicing her support for Trump’s re-election, prompting the short-lived former PM to leave.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Led By DonkeysElon MuskMark ZuckerbergJeff BezosnewsShareReuse this content"

I’d just played the Jobs for a Change festival, in the middle of London, easy to get to by tube. But Glastonbury was like being on an island. You had to deal with the weather, the food and the toilets. It was also mainly populated by Bristolians. I performed once solo, but also got up on the Pyramid stage with [country and western singer] Hank Wangford to do (Get Your Kicks On) Route 66. The original Pyramid was made from corrugated iron and doubled as a cowshed. I remember it being swampy backstage. There were no bars, you had to bring in your own beer. Keith Allen and [Scottish poet] Jock Scott blagged their way in, pretending to be a Belgian film crew, and sold cans of Red Stripe for 50p.Glastonbury’s still an island. You can’t just walk down to the tube station and grab a Greggs. The thing I look most forward to is the Crumble Shack [food stall], which you can see when you’re performing on the Left Field stage, and for a man of my age, is very distracting. Instead of the great issues of the day to speak about, all I’m thinking is: “Shall I have ice-cream or custard with my rhubarb crumble?”Fatboy SlimPyramidstage 1986Norman CookThe first time I played Glastonbury was with the Housemartins. We’d never played to a crowd that large before, let alone played during daylight. We also thought it would be full of bearded hippies who’d throw mud and piss at us. Instead, the sun shone, we made lots of new friends, and I fell in love with the festival. I still have a bootleg of the performance. You can hear the nerves and excitement in our voices: we’re generally in tune, but we play everything way too fast. The crowd seemed to grow organically: people wanted to see for themselves what four spotty boys from Hull had to say about the state of the nation. It took me 38 years and 98 DJ sets to get back on the Pyramid stage. Last year I joined [former Housemartins bandmate] Paul Heaton to reprise Happy Hour and celebrate our good fortune to still be allowed to play at the best festival in the world.AshNME stage 1995View image in fullscreenYoung blood Ash in 1995.Photograph: Rob Watkins/AlamyRick McMurray (drummer)Our singerTim [Wheeler] had finished school days earlier. Kung Fu had topped the indie chart and nearly cracked the Top 40, but Glastonbury was the first time we felt its impact live. It was also the first time we played Girl from Mars. That Glastonbury performance helped launch it skywards, into the charts, and into a wild few years that took us from indie clubs to something close to Beatlemania in Japan. Our Glastonbury set was the moment we stopped being a part-time school band and became a full-time touring machine.Two years later, we were back, headlining the Other stage on Friday. Then came a knock on the bus: Emily Eavis asking us to step in as Sunday headliner on the Pyramid stage. Just like that, we’d headlined both stages in one year.It was mind-blowing.You can even spot my future wife in the crowd during Kung Fu in 95. It’s our 10th anniversary this year – I need to dash to the petrol station for some flowers!Shed SevenNMEstage, 1995Rick WitterWe’ve only played Glastonbury once – 30 years ago, in 1995, the year it was boiling hot. Oasis were there and Robbie Williams in his red Adidas tracky top and peroxide blond hair. I don’t remember watching any of the bands. I think I got caught in the fact that we were playing Glastonbury. It’s hard not feel like a small cog in this huge music event, but the crowd were amazing. It’s funny when you write a set of songs and then you start getting noticed: loads of things just suddenly fall into place, like getting booked to play Glastonbury. It was a bit like the first time we were played on the radio; we pulled the car over to the side of the motorway to listen to ourselves. Glastonbury was like that. It’s not often you get to appreciate those moments as perhaps you should. We can’t wait to go back!Scissor SistersPyramidstage & Dance tent 2004Jake ShearsI remember how excited we were. We didn’t have a notion of how large it was going to be. I remember our drum tech, Nigel – this amazing soul – giving us a pep talk, saying: “This is yours for the taking.” It rained during our afternoon show, but we still had a blast. Our second show in the Dance tent is still one of my favourite sets ever. It was truly electric. There was something magical in the air. It felt as if the whole world had spun around. Then our debut album went to No 1. Really magical things happen at Glastonbury. The madness and magnitude still blows my mind to this very day.View image in fullscreenJake Shears of Scissor Sisters performing at Glastonbury, 2004.Photograph: Kieran Doherty/ReutersBabydaddyIt was a moment of synergy. It felt like the stars were aligning. We played twice on the Saturday: the Pyramid stage mid-afternoon, and the Dance tent early evening. I think we realised for the first time that this was going to be something that, as New Yorkers, we were going to be accepted for. I also remember the mud. I wore wellies for the first time, trying keep our stage clothes intact and look as glamorous as we possibly could. Glastonbury isn’t just a music festival. It’s a party, an art installation, a cultural touchstone, a spiritual destination. It remains one of the most special memories in our career.Kate NashParkstage 2007View image in fullscreenA walk in the Park … Kate Nash at Glastonbury in 2007.Photograph: Sonny MalhotraI was in awe of Glastonbury because I’d never been before. We set up our tents and stayed the whole weekend. It was a muddy year: I remember buying a red poncho, and I did an interview with NME wearing a bright yellow American Apparel hoodie. I remember seeing Lily Cole at a coffee stand and thinking she was so beautiful, and admiring Lovefoxxx from CSS’s sequined bodysuit. I also got “married” to my best friend when Iggy Pop played I Wanne Be Your Dog. I stole a chicken ornament with Emmy the Great, which I ended up gifting to Amy Winehouse on Jack White’s tour bus. Playing Merry Happy on the Park stage, as I sang the lyrics “I can watch a sunset on my own”, the sun came out and it felt magical.Self EsteemGuardian lounge 2009View image in fullscreenSelf Esteem at Glastonbury, 2019.Photograph: Michael Cragg/The GuardianRebecca Lucy TaylorThe first time I performed as Self Esteem was on the BBC Introducing Stage in 2019. But I’d performed with my previous duo Slow Club in 2009, 10 years earlier. We played the Guardian lounge, so we did our little trick of leaving the stage and coming into the middle of the room, because the tent was quite big and there weren’t very many people. I remember thinking: “I wish we were playing on a bigger stage,” and felt really jealous of everyone that got to. It was also around the time of swine flu, so I spent most of that Glastonbury very poorly in a tent, while everyone else had fun. I’m looking forward to going back this year and making some new memories.Rizzle KicksBBC Introducing stage 2013Harley SylvesterWe were playing a secret set, so we weren’t allowed to announce it until a few hours before. It was a super-fun set, and the crowd was packed. After that, it all gets a little bit blurry. I remember we had some TV interviews to do. Our TV rep – who still to this day is one of my favourite people – said: “All right boys, you’ve got an interview in four hours. I want you to come back nice and calm and relaxed.” You can’t say that to two 21-year-old boys who are experiencing Glastonbury for the first time. The interview we did isn’t fun to watch. Well, it’s hilarious to watch if you’re not me or Jordan. But we were young and at Glastonbury, so we were going to take advantage. We’re super gassed to be playing again, and even better that we are properly on the bill this time.Festivalgoers arrive for Glastonbury 2025 – in picturesRead moreJordan StephensI was not sober. I vaguely remember watching Primal Scream and the Rolling Stones. I then spent three days in the late-night area, Shangri-La. I’m not sure if I slept. I was in this whirlwind vortex of drum’n’bass and deep house. I spent a whole morning at the Stone Circle feeling spiritually uplifted by the coming together of wonderful people and the rising of the sun. I felt so at one with nature, I refused to sleep in a tent, but ended up getting a rash over the whole of my body and then couldn’t leave my house for a week.Black Country, New RoadPark stage & West Holts, 2023Georgia Ellery:It was the first time I’d been to Glastonbury. I was lucky enough to be playing twice, on Saturday with Jockstrap and on Sunday with Black Country, New Road. So technically my first performance was with Jockstrap! I was very nervous, knowing everyone at home would be watching on telly and some of the songs would live on YouTube forever. I’d sprained my ankle the night before, so I had to ice my foot before we went on. We walked on stage to the theme tune to Succession. I also remember how hot it was – luckily I was wearing my gold hot pants and top. I came off stage thinking we’d butchered it and it had gone terribly. But all our friends and family ensured us that the vibes in the crowd had been great. I wanted to celebrate, but I couldn’t exactly have the biggest night in the world because I had another show to play the next day.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury festivalBilly BraggKate NashRizzle KicksScissor SistersFatboy SlimAshfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Pyramid stage sets will be available to stream live in ultra-high definition and in British Sign Language.“I used to watch Glastonbury on the TV,” says Jamz. “I remember being like 19 and watching artists like Janelle Monáe performing, but it wasn’t as interactive. With the iPlayer it’s all happening live and you’re able to almost build your own festival from the performances. There is something for everyone.”The dizzying scale of the task of broadcasting the festival falls to a team at BBC Studios, the broadcaster’s commercial subsidiary, lead by the executive producer Alison Howe. The operation will feature more than 90 artists across more than 90 hours of coverage, using 58 cameras and 50km of fibre cable, and is months in the making.“The performances alone, that’s a bit of a task – a brilliant and beautiful task, I may add,” says Howe. “Some artists want to work quite intimately with their performance and how we capture it. Others are very happy to just let us get on with it, because we have a good rep there for making all artists look and sound good on the BBC.“Then there’s the amount of hours across all the TV, curated and presented coverage, and then all the live streams. So when I sit and think about that, I feel sick.”Jonathan Rothery, the BBC’s head of pop music TV, works with Howe in effect as commissioning editor forGlastonbury festivalto shape the offering. He is still in awe at the scale of the challenge. “I remember having a moment there a couple of years ago,” he says, “after a very busy day … just looking at all of the cablework running across the site – I’m not a technical person so it blew my mind.”View image in fullscreenThe BBC’s Jonathan Rothery, Alison Howe, Zoe Ball and Lorna Clarke with the festival organiser, Emily Eavis (centre).Photograph: BBCThis year the producers face a headache over theinclusion on the lineup of Kneecap, a trio of Irish republicans who have been accused of making statements on stage in support of Hamas and Hezbollah, an allegation they have strongly denied. One of the group, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, has been charged under terrorism laws and is currently on bail.There has been political pressure – including from the prime minister – on festival organisers to drop the band and on the BBC not to broadcast their performance.Asked about the issue, Rothery says: “Our plan is to bring as many of the sets to our audience as we possibly can but obviously we have editorial guidelines, and we need to make sure that any artist on the stage, regardless of who they are, fits within our guidelines and is appropriate for the audience. We have those conversations and make those decisions all the way up to the festival and over the weekend.”Howe and Rothery work closely with festival organisers, including Emily Eavis, months in advance and are privy to the lineup before its general release. With the overwhelming choice on offer, Rothery says, the television and radio package manages to navigate any clashes. “That’s why the live stage streams are super useful. So if you want to curate your own Glastonbury, you can fill your boots.”Howe and her team work closely with the artists to make sure the live performances are represented well on television. “We offer to talk through meetings on – site. At festivals, no one gets a sound check, so a lot is at stake,” she says, en route to a run-through with the Friday night Pyramid stage headliners, the 1975.Jamz Supernova’s hot tips for the weekend includeAlanis Morissette on the Pyramid stage, Ezra Collective on the Other stage, Yussef Dayes and Doechii on the West Holts stage and Anohni and the Johnsons on the Park stage.She holds great respect for the scale of the undertaking, having experienced Glastonbury as a performing DJ and as a reveller and now seeing it from the other side: “All these people, all these nuts and bolts, come together to make it happen.

But whatever happens next, the moral stain will remainThu 26 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 06.30 EDTShareOne year ago, as cheering supporters waved union jacks to celebrate Labour’s election landslide, Keir Starmer walked into Downing Streetwith a promise: the country had voted “for change. For national renewal. And a return of politics to public service.” On Tuesday, his government will ask parliamentto remove benefitsfrom more than 1 million disabled and sick people.You will have already heard much about the Westminster drama of the vote. More than120 Labour MPshave signed an amendment aiming to kill the bill next week, with more stillsaid to be joining, presumably fuelled by the sense this was not the “change” they were elected for. It has been a welcome relief to see such moral strength, with backbenchers and even a now former government whip dodging alleged threats of deselection to stand up for their constituents. Starmer says he will “press forward” with the cuts,describing the rebelsas “noises off”, but behind the scenes No 10 is said to be desperately trying to get MPs – including frontbenchers – back in line.In the coming days, the papers will inevitably splash on what the size of the rebellion means for Starmer’s premiershipwhile pundits gas about rumoured resignations, as though all of this were a game and the only casualty a promising ministerial career. Let’s remember, then, what – and who – it is MPs would be voting for. With the number of people relying on disability benefits growing, the government plans to tighten eligibility for personal independence payments (Pip). That means up to 1.2 million disabled people, many of whom are already in some of the poorest households in the country, could losebetween £4,200 and £6,300a year they need to pay for the extra costs of disability. Under the changes, due to be introduced in November 2026, disabled people would not qualify for Pip unless they score a minimum of four points on an assessment designed to measure their ability to carry out a single daily activity, such as washing or getting dressed.Look at Labour’s cruel attitude towards disability benefits, then tell me Keir Starmer cares about 'human dignity' | John HarrisRead moreIf that sounds like technical jargon, just talk to Lee – a worried reader who emailed me – and the human impact of the policy becomes clear. Lee has multiple debilitating health conditions – from muscle wasting and joint pain to depression and daily seizures – and was reassessed for Pip in March. He scraped by to win the lowest benefit rate, but didn’t score the magic four points in any category – which means that if MPs vote to change the rules, it is likely Lee will be rejected next time he’s assessed. That’s despite the fact he needs help from his partner to shower, cook and use the toilet. Lee is “petrified” of losing his disability benefits and his seizures are increasing from the stress. “I couldn’t survive without the support I receive,” he says. “It would be a death sentence for me.”NoLabourminister will tell you they want to take Pip from people like Lee. No politician who cuts disability benefits ever says out loud, “We will take support from people who rely on it.” Instead, they cast doubt on reality, chipping away at trust in the social security system and, with it, our disabled neighbours. They say we should give benefits to people who “genuinely need them”, as though not everyone receiving them does. They pick a “good reason” for cutting support – a bloated welfare bill, say, or a labour market crisis – and paint empathy as costly and cruelty as prudent.That’s why government figures – including Starmer himselfin response to the rebellion– repeatedly claim the cuts will getdisabled people into work, even though a Pip award has no relation to whether someone has a job or not.It is telling that the official forecast for the policy’s impact on employment isn’t due to be publisheduntil October– meaning that MPs are being asked to cut disabled people’s benefits on the basis it will help them find work without any evidence to back this up. Or, as Labour MPstabling the amendment put it: “We are being asked to vote before consultation with disabled people and before impact assessments.” Facts, it seems, don’t trump fiscal rules.Even if a few thousand long-term sick people get jobs as a result of the changes, it will pale in significance compared with the number pushed into penury:analysis by Trussell and WPI Economicsshows nearly half a million people in disabled households will be forced into severe hardship if the government goes ahead with the full cuts. “Tightening eligibility criteria” is a neat euphemism for withholding the money disabled people need to live.The Pip change is only the beginning. In the same bill, MPs are due to vote tocut the health top-upof universal credit for new claimants from £97 a week to £50 in order to, in the government’s words, fix a system “which encourages sickness” – as well asscrap it entirelyfor under-22s. That’s still not all: when the work capabilities assessment is abolished, Pip will become the “gateway” for this benefit, so swathes of people who lose Pip won’t be eligible forout-of-work sickness benefitspayments either.Like many, Lee receives both Pip and universal credit – which means Labour’s “reforms” could see his two main strands of support pulled away. On top of that, his partner could also have her carer’s allowance taken, as that’slinked to Pip eligibilitytoo. Lee has already done the maths. If both his disability benefits are stopped, he will lose precisely £718.87 per month. That works out at roughly half his income. “I’ve told the crisis team [these cuts] would be the end of me,” he admits. “Why would anyone want to go on without any support or quality of life?”That’s the thing with Westminster drama. Politics is only a game if you are privileged enough to be cushioned from its effects. For others, it is what decides whether there is enough food in the cupboard or whether a care worker arrives to help you wash your hair.In 2015, fresh from the coalition pact, the Liberal Democrats were punished by the electorate for helping the Conservatives push through sweeping public spending cuts. Come the next general election, the accusation will not be that Starmer’s Labour cosied up to the Tories for power, but that they embodied them: their cruelty, their austerity and, ultimately, their failure.In the event the rebel amendment wins or Downing Street is forced to pull the vote or water down plans to save face, it cannot undo the fact that the government wished to enact these cuts in the first place. If the bill does go ahead, the division lobby will shine a light not simply on the chasms in the Labour party, but between compassion and careerism, bravery and betrayal.Forget the MPs who rebel over cutting disabled people’s benefits – remember those who don’t. This is Labour’s poll tax. Its tuition fees. Its Partygate. Just as the Iraq war was for Tony Blair, disability cuts is the moral stain that will mark Starmer’s government and the party for years to come. Severely disabled and ill people are going to be starved, isolated and degraded as a result of this policy. No Labour MP who backs it should be forgiven.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Why spend billions on weapons – soft power would keep us safeSimon JenkinsWith hawks on one side and doves on the other, we ignore the obvious fact that engagement is the best defence against conflictThu 26 Jun 2025 13.37 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 14.48 EDTShare‘Toadying”, “slavish”, “cringe-worthy” were the words hurled at Nato’s Mark Rutte for the praise he heaped on Donald Trump. But words cost nothing. Keir Starmer went further. He dug into his pocket andgave Trump$1.3bn for just 12 aeroplanes. He promised never to use them, or put any bombs in them, without orders from Washington. He might as well have enrolled in the United States Air Force.Starmer is engaged in a strategic shift in Britain’s global stance – from soft power to hard. He has clearly received the notorious initial briefing that so moved Tony Blair and led him eventually to war in Iraq. It induced David Cameron to spend billions on aircraft carriers that he had intended to cancel. Now the government warns in its strategic review that Britain needs to prepare for the possibility of being attacked on its own soil. Perhaps Starmer agrees with Nato’s Rutte that the British people “better learn to speak Russian”.Russia has never, in its entire existence, tried to invade Britain. Yet to protect its interest a defence industry of vast public expense has sustained this belief. It has demanded we go to war if Russia so much as inches over its border, as if it abutted Norfolk. Clearly Britain needs to defend its cables and its electronic airwaves. It needs to guard its banks and its businesses from mischief. But no one is threatening it with invasion.With the end of the cold war in 1989, soft power should have been unleashed. Every conceivable tool should have been deployed to introduce Russia into the European community of nations. I was one of many westerners in the 1990s who would go to seminars and meetings with eager figures in Moscow’s hierarchy. They were open-minded and democratic and desperate to open dialogues with the west. They sent their children to English schools and universities. Cultural exchange was intense. The same was happening, less openly, with China. It was a time of real hope.Yet the old dog-eared briefings were still being used. We were told we cannot be “too safe”. Nato’s belligerents declared their muscle by advancing to Russia’s border. Barrier after barrier went up, as Russia reverted to its old conflicts with its bordering states. You could sense the west’s defence pundits sinking thankfully back into their old ways.In his definition of soft power, the American academic Joseph Nye suggested that cooperation “is always more effective than coercion … Values like democracy, human rights and individual opportunities are deeply seductive.” Soft power is about building friends and finding allies, rather than creating enemies. Britain, poised between Europe and the US and with English as a global language, was uniquely positioned for this task.Thirteen years ago, a globalsoft power indexfrom the Institute for Government placed Britain as number one, above even that citadel of soft (as well as hard) power, the US. More recently,another indexput it third after Germany and Japan. These are not trivial statistics. They measure the influence a country can be expected to exert in any conflict short of war.Today, the primary east-west power struggle beyond the Ukraine war is essentially soft. It illustrates the west’s poor use of it. The isolation of Russia – economically, culturally and diplomatically – has not altered its aggression in Ukraine. What ishasdone is push Russia closer to China and the non-aligned Brics-plus nations across Asia, Africa and Latin America. China’s soft power projection is enormous, from its belt-and-braces investment outreach to50 cultural institutesdue to open around the world.Why Europe needs a common defence fund – outside the EU | Simon NixonRead moreStarmer’s response has been unbelievable. He wants to outbid Trump in slashing his chief soft power resource, overseas aid. He is making thebiggest cut everin Britain’s aid programme, from 0.5 to 0.3% of gross national income. % He has continued toslash the BBC’s World Service, the nation’s outstanding global presence. With 320 million listeners in English and 41 other languages, it has beenshrunk by 500 postssince 2022. I shall never forget a group of Chinese girls crowded, freezing, round a radio in the border city of Harbin, eagerly practising their English with the aid of the BBC. This outreach is equalled by England’s education system. Since the turn of the century, it has become the start in life for millions, not just from Russia and China but from around the globe. About 390,000 non-EU studentscame to Britainlast year, 19% down on 2023 and a level that is forecast to plunge in future. It must be in Britain’s interest for them to keep coming.Soft power lies in contact – cultural, financial, academic and diplomatic. Opposition to a hostile regime emerges if not from its military then from its commercial and professional class. Ostracism merely drives that class into silence or exile. In Russia, opposition from those who used to influence Vladimir Putin and might restrain him has collapsed. In their place are the sabre-rattlers. Starmer appears to be one of them.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Donald Trump managed tofly his B-2sall the way from Missouri without any help. No doubt it was a beautiful bombing. It hit the last target – the behemoth Fordow, deep in the mountains.Benjamin Netanyahu is congratulating himself too, for finally scratching his three-decade itch by striking Iran’s nuclear programme, and assassinating topIslamic Revolutionary Guards Corpscommanders. Most of all, Netanyahu managed to draw Trump, who had promised no more wars, into the fray. The hardline followers of the Islamic republic are also congratulating themselves on their successful strikes against Israel.The strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities brought fear of contamination throughout the week. Our social media were filled with an updated Iranian version of theduck-and-cover campaignfrom cold war America. In case of exposure to radiation, get inside, we were told, change your clothes, take a shower and tape the windows. Not a single siren has sounded: apparently, we don’t have them any more. Those who remember theIraq-Iran warsay there used to be sirens. Nor do we have shelters like Israelis do. Considering we have been at loggerheads with Israel for decades now, why haven’t they built some?For the past 12 days we have had a crash course in the sounds of war. The boom of a rocket hitting its target, the sharpratatatof the ground-to-air defence. You don’t see the missiles that blow up, but you see the red dots of the defences when they start at night.The first days were a blur. The big emotional freeze. The frenzy to gather documents and essentials for a speedy departure. The calculus of doom: how much water do I need? How many T-shirts should I pack? When should I leave? How far should I go? What is their scenario for us – Iraq or Afghanistan?

What?! He has coloured the map of Iran into segments. This is Turkmenistan, this is Balochistan, this is Azerbaijan, here in the south are the Arabs and in the middle are some Persians. How dare he? We are one of the oldest nations in the world. We didn’t invade this land – we are not recent immigrants. We are actuallyfromhere. We have survivedAlexander of Macedonia’s pyromania, we have survived Genghis Khan’s bloodbath and a brutal Arab invasion, and we are still here. We are the inheritors of the great poets Ferdowsi, Rumi andHafez, who give us our shared identity even though we speak many languages. I am sure I was not the only Iranian finding solace in Hafez this past week.Now that we have had a moment to breathe, the interminable question of these past few days, “what will happen now?”, is about the long term.Over the past 46 years Iranians have eroded the strictideology that was imposedon them in order to live a modern life. We have been hoping since 2015 and the signing of the joint comprehensive plan of action for the lifting of sanctions so we could reconnect to the world and fix our corrupted economy. Trump F-worded that chance. Our young people have stood up to the repressive rules that governed their personal lives; some died for it. Now, thanks to Israel and its benevolent bombs, the extreme sections of society, the ideologues who were marginalised, will be newly invigorated by conflict.We are a country at war now. The streets are full of checkpoints. I passed several driving in Tehran the other night. They are courteous now, but we recognise them from the days of protest.

We buried my stepmother in the cemetery south of Tehran three days ago. The road to the cemetery, usually packed with traffic, was almost empty. Tehran empty of its unbearable traffic and noise is suddenly so beautiful. I have never loved this city as much as I do now. The road to the cemetery will now be the route so many families will take to bury their dead. Along the way, I wonder how many Palestinians were killed while the eyes of the world were on us.We have had an exceptionally long and sublime spring in Tehran this year. The geraniums on my porch are still in bloom. It looks like the persimmon tree will have more fruit than any other year. If the relief holds, the questions that kept popping up during the attacks and were waved aside as pointless in an existential crisis will loom large. And the main one will be: what did this madness achieve for the people of Iran, Israel or the US?

All Nato’s key problems remainMartin KettleThe relationship with him is still volatile, the Ukraine strategy still unclear and Europe needs to ensure its collective defenceThu 26 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 06.33 EDTShareNato’s Hague summit was an orchestrated grovel at the feet of Donald Trump. The originally planned two-day meeting was truncated into a single morning’s official business to flatter thepresident’s egoand accommodate his short attention span. The agenda was cynically narrowed to focus on the defence spending hikes he demands from US allies. Issues that may provoke or embarrass Trump – the Ukraine conflict, or whether the Iranian nuclear threat hasactually been eliminatedby US bombing – were relegated to the sidelines.Instead, the flattery throttle was opened up to maximum, with Nato’s secretary generalMark Rutte leadingthe assembled fawning. On Tuesday, Rutte hymned Trump’s brilliance over Iran; yesterday, he garlanded him as the vindicated visionary of Nato’s drive towards the5% of GDPspending goal. No one spoiled the party. As the president’s own former adviser Fiona Hill put it yesterday, Nato seemed briefly to have turned into the North Atlantic Trump Organization.For Rutte and most of the alliance leaders, however, this was 24 hours of self-abasement with a specific goal. The purpose of this first Nato summit of the second Trump presidency was to keep the US as fully on board as possible with the transatlantic alliance. Nothing else mattered. Any repetition of the shocks that JD Vance and Pete Hegseth delivered to Europe at the Munich security conference in February was to be avoided at all costs. In pursuit of that objective, nohumiliation or hypocrisywas too gross.So, was it mission accomplished for Nato? Maybe yes, judging by Trump’s generally good behaviour in The Hague. The 5% pledge was “very big news”, he announced. The US was still committed to Nato’s article 5 collective-defence doctrine, he appeared to say at his post-summit press conference, though his curious choice of words – “We are here to help them protect their country” – will not reassure everyone. The leaders have nevertheless emerged with what Henry James called “the equanimity of a result”. The Nato summit got what it was designed to get.But in every longer term way, this appeasement of Trump solves nothing. In political terms the Hague summit does not mark the resumption of normal relationships, let alone the beginning of a newNatogolden age. Such things are not possible in the Trump era. Politically, the summit was a bunker buster dodged. True, things have not got worse, an outcome that many, including Rutte, will regard as a kind of achievement. However, none of Nato’s other preexisting difficulties has been solved. Most remain firmly in place.0:24'Daddy has to sometimes use strong language': Nato chief on Trump's Israel-Iran outburst – videoOf these, four stand out. The first and most immediate is Ukraine. There has been no change in Trump’s impatience with Ukraine, his belief in a ceasefire or his unwillingness to renew US military aid. But nor can the other Nato members supply the aid that Ukraine needs. So the war grinds on, in part because of Trump. Some believe the war could even become permanent. “Rather than assuming the war can be ended through a comprehensive battlefield victory or a negotiated compromise,” the Carnegie Endowment analyst and former Ukrainian defence ministerAndriy Zagorodnyuk wroteearlier this month, “Ukraine and its allies must plan to build a viable, sovereign and secure state under constant military pressure.” Trump would not be interested in that.The second difficulty is Trump’s sheer unpredictability. Everything was well choreographed in The Hague, but for how long will this last? No one can say for sure. The world is still absorbing the implications of Trump’s impulsive handling ofIran, in which military action was repudiated in favour of diplomacy one day, before war was launched the next, followed by the proclamation of peace on the one after that. The Iran bombing has reminded the US’s Nato allies of just how little sway they actually possess over the president, and has underscored the difficulty of second-guessing Trump’s actions.This feeds through into the third problem. The commitment to spend 5% of GDP on defence is a policy goal not a present reality. The UK, for instance, aims to get to5% by 2035, and it will only do so through some jiggery-pokery over what can legitimately be classified as security, as the government’s new national security strategy document, published on Tuesday to coincide with the Nato summit, makes clear.Ten years is a long time. Much will change. Trump’s successors may be more committed to Nato, or they may be even more unreliable than he is. There could be regime change in other places too. No one knows. Warfare is certain to change, as the drone revolution has shown. Nato needs to be careful not to bring 20th-century assumptions to bear on 21st-century planning. The national security strategy document rightly posits this period as an era of “radical uncertainty”. Yet investors, including investors in high value hi-tech industries such as defence, abhor uncertainty.Trump is angry with a world that won’t give him easy deals | Rafael BehrRead moreWhich brings us to the fourth problem. Patching things up with Trump may solve nothing because hemarches to his own drum. But the threats do not go away. This means that the European Nato nations and Canada have to forge a viable system of collective defence against hostile threats that is not dependent on the whims of the person in the White House at every turn. That is a very large task. But Washington cannot have a veto on whether the nations of Europe defend themselves against, say, Russian aggressions.There is no real choice in the circumstances. The allies are faced with the huge task of gradually reducing their long dependency on the US’s technology and armaments without provoking a complete rupture with the US. At the same time, they must increase their own and Europe’s defence capacity. It is a devilishly difficult course, with which Britain’s political leaders, never mind Britain’s security world, would be profoundly uncomfortable. Yet that is the one on which we are embarked.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNatoOpinionDonald TrumpMark RutteIranUkraineDefence policycommentShareReuse this content"

Next year may be differentNils PratleyShell says it has ‘no intention’ of making an offer for BP. But if its share price rises, the numbers could workThu 26 Jun 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 14.14 EDTShareBP is a sitting duck for a takeover bid by most criteria. Its share price has underperformed rivals’ for years. The latest strategic “re-set” was a bits-and-pieces production involving disposals, which do not happen overnight, plus a dilution of green energy ambitions that upset one sub-set of shareholders and didn’t go far enough according to another. Meanwhile, the chair,Helge Lund,is set to exit next yearafter being pursued by an activist investor.SoShell, the most credible possible bidder by a distance, would be asleep at the wellhead if it were not taking a look and calculating what costs could be removed, which development licences it fancies and how regulators and governments might react. That’s standard stuff, and Shell, one assumes, will have maintained a version of such modelling for about 20 years, which is roughly as long as tales of a combination of the two companies have been running.But here comes a response to media reports that was as definitive as these things tend to come:Shell says it has “no intention” of making an offer for BP, a statement that takes it ofside as a bidder for six months under Takeover Panel rules.One should still remember the small print about the circumstances in which the Panel’s Rule 2.8 does not apply, because two are not unimaginable – somebody else taking a pop, or BP’s board agreeing to a bid. But Shell alsosaidit “has not been actively considering making an offer” and “has not made an approach”, which was a strong signal to the market to cool its jets. The share prices of the two companies, after a brief burst of excitement in New York trading, went back to where they were.We’re also back to the same place in terms of pin-pointingthe biggest obstacle to a deal: Shell’s share price. Or, more precisely, it is Shell management’s loud declarations that its shares are dirt cheap and therefore should be bought by the company itself in large quantities for cancellation. Buy-backs have run at $3bn or more for 14 quarters in a row.“I have said in the past that we want to be value hunters,” Wael Sawan, the chief executive, said in May. “Today, value hunting – in my view – is buying back more Shell.” That doesn’t in itself rule out mega bids, but it sets “an incredibly high bar”, as the finance director, Sinead Gorman, put it.The thinking makes sense. Any £60bn-plus bid for an ailing rival would inevitably involve Shell issuing oodles of new paper. That is tricky to justify if you genuinely believe your acquisition currency is seriously undervalued and you add value by maintaining buy-backs. BP is not a must-do deal for Shell,as argued here previously. The arithmetic might work if BP’s board agreed to roll over and be bought at a tiny takeover premium – but that possibility must be remote.None of which is to deny the industrial logic in a combination. There probably are huge costs that could be ripped out. Panmure Liberum’s analyst notes thatBPhas more than 100,000 staff, yet Shell delivers far higher returns with 96,000. Equally, one could imagine Shell offering to buy chunks of BP’s oil and gas acreage but not the whole company, something that is not excluded under Rule 2.8.But the takeover dance feels like it requires Shell’s share price to be higher to make the numbers work. On that front, the recent trend is in the right direction but more progress is surely needed, which is why a “nothing for six months” statement is costless from Shell’s point of view. Next year the arithmetic may stack up more easily.As for BP, this is starting to feel like a proper crisis. Its share price has drifted even lower since the unveiling in February of the supposedly “exciting” new strategy. Disposals to ease the strain on the balance sheet remain a work in progress. One assumes a new chair, with authority to re-set the re-set, will be found before the six months are up. But the appointment can’t come soon enough.Explore more on these topicsBusinessNils Pratley on financeShellOilBPEnergy industryMergers and acquisitionscommentShareReuse this content"

I love it, of course, and I’ll always give the baby its first “Like”.My favourite part, however, besides the miracle of newborn life etc, is finding out what those people have called the child. I want to know all the names. I’ll click on the baby announcements of people I know, people I don’t know, and I’ll definitely click on a birth announcement from a celebrity, even if I’ve never heardtheirname before. It might surprise you to learn that I am not in the habit of judging these names, though. This is for two reasons – one, I’m a bogan from regional Queensland, I’ve heard names you can’t even imagine. And two, I have sympathy for the job!I would personally find it really difficult to bestow a name on a tiny creature that you’ve just met. Do you want the name to be unique or normal? Classic? Classic like how – popular or old lady name from the 50s? What if it’s the name of a sociopath? What if it’s the name of a real estate agent? What does the name mean to you and your entire family, but also your ancestors? What does the name mean according to websites with lists like 500-top-cool-baby-names-for-boys-who-love-their-mamas? What if you named your child something equivalent to Skibidi Toilet without knowing? What is Skibidi Toilet? What if the name helps them get bullied? What if, even worse, the name has zero impact? And on and on.The noises you make every day fill me with disgust. Now I’m not afraid to tell you | Rebecca ShawRead moreSo I don’t judge my parents for naming me Rebecca. Even though my three brothers’ names all start with M, and Rebecca famously starts with R. Even though it’s so common and boring, they could have at least given me Ursula as a middle name and made me “R. U. Shaw”, an instant laugh. But I’ll get over it.This past week, I started to receive a few strange messages from people I know. Messages like “Umm … did you secretly make a TV show?” with a photo of the credits of a TV show and the name REBECCA SHAW listed as co-creator. While I appreciate these people thinking highly enough of me to imagine a world where I made a TV show without talking and posting about it every second of my life, I unfortunately didnotmake a show, secretly or otherwise.I can understand the confusion – the show in question is Adults, a new (very funny!) ensemble comedy that is described as a gen z vibes Broad City. That is a concept and project that it makes perfect sense for me to be involved with (except that I am old). But in this case it was not me – Adults was made by the bizarro world Rebecca Shaw, who I have encountered before. (In this case “bizarro world” means she is funny, talented, works in a similar field but in America, and is far more productive.)This is not my first encounter with a more famous Rebecca Shaw. For my entire adult life I have been sent photos of books in secondhand stores by the very prolific author Rebecca Shaw, who wrote a successful series of gentle novels called things like A Country Affair and Trouble in the Village. For a long time, when you Googled the name Rebecca Shaw, she was the main Rebecca Shaw. Then, for a time when you Googled Rebecca Shaw, her description (and the fact she had died in 2015) would come up but with a photo of me.We all know that Juliet (from Romeo and Juliet) once asked,“What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”, but it’s easy for her to say – Juliet has a cool unique name. In my grade 10 maths class, there were literally FIVE Rebeccas. Then, my first girlfriend was Rebecca (luckily already went by Becky), and she went on to date another Rebecca. The overpopulation of Rebeccas would be OK if it wasn’t in such stark difference to the conversely small amount of famous women named Rebecca. We do not have proper A-list representation and it isweird.I am sick of seeing the rich and powerful on my screen. Where are all the TV shows about normal people? | Rebecca ShawRead moreAccording to anecdotal evidence and my not continuing maths after grade 10, about 40% of white women with boring names born in the 80s are called Rebecca. Yet, can you think of a current A-list star that is named Rebecca? The other white-lady-no-imagination names in my cohort are ones like Sarah, Jennifer, Jessica, Rachel. I can name at least four currently very famous women with each of those names off the top of my head. Ben Affleck has dated more Jennifers than there are famous Rebeccas. Of course there have been some notable Rebeccas throughout history and in pop culture. The book Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier. Rebecca Romijn. Rebecca Black. Bec Hewitt. Bec Hewitt’s wedding poem to Lleyton Hewitt. That’s a thin list for such a popular name.It just feels like at the moment, and actually maybe forever, Rebeccas are flopping. Instead of standing out, we have gone with infiltration into the population. We are everywhere you look … except on lists of celebrities and people with influence. We have a couple of exciting rising Rebeccas – for example, Rebecca Hall and Rebecca Ferguson are both extremely talented, very beautiful actors who are starring in more and more high-profile movies. Bizarro World Rebecca Shaw is obviously killing it. But we need more, to shore up the ranks. We need Rebeccas to rise up, to break out, to become stars. If it’s too late for us, and it may be, we need a new generation of possibly powerful Rebeccas. So I’ll keep clicking on your baby announcements, crossing my fingers for a Rebecca to pin my hopes on.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Something. Something has emerged from the vast opaque corporate entity that is Amazon MGM, which swallowed up theJames Bond brand from Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli– the latter being reportedly discontented (though presumably very much richer).White smoke has emerged from the funnel marked “director” – though still nothing from the funnel marked “star” – and it’s a really big hitter.Denis Villeneuveis the Canadian film-maker who gave us the excellent science-fiction moviesArrival,Blade Runner 2049and Dune Parts One andTwo, and has demonstrated a real flair for big-budget action thrillers inSicarioand Prisoners, with plenty of the ambient sexiness in hardware and spectacle. (Perhaps Villeneuve will now get the ultimate corporate blessing of being a last-minute wedding guest at the Bezos wedding in Venice this weekend, precisely the sort of event that tends to feature as a Bond film opening scene, to be disrupted by helicopter attack, explosion, kidnapping etc. Mr Bezos himself needs a white persian cat on his lap to stroke.)View image in fullscreenGood with leading men … Dune: Part Two stars Timothee Chalamet, Austin Butler, Denis Villeneuve and Josh Brolin.Photograph: Gregory Pace/REX/ShutterstockVilleneuve is much more than a safe pair of hands or a technical director who can be relied upon to do what the suits tell him; he is an alpha-grade auteur in the same league as Christopher Nolan and so his presence will reassure the fanbase with mixed feelings about the Amazon sale. The message is that, yes, Amazon is still thinking big and that the future Bond will be primarily up there on the big screen where Villeneuve has made his reputation and not simply on the smaller screens where long-form streaming content is reportedly going to be spun off: The Adventures of Moneypenny, The Prequel Adventures of M etc etc. (Although these are surely in development.)But even given that Villeneuve is in place and he can work perfectly happily with James Norton or Regé-Jean Page or Henry Golding or Tom Hiddleston … what about the writing? When Danny Boyle was temporarily and unhappily brought on as director in 2018, the problem was that he had his own very specific creative vision as regards story, wishing to work in tandem with his own longtime collaborator, the screenwriter John Hodge. But their ideas wouldn’t fly with Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli who had their own trusted writers, Bond script veterans Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who had a track record of getting the goose to lay the golden egg as regular as clockwork.View image in fullscreenAnd women … Emily Blunt in Sicario.Photograph: Richard Foreman, Jr.  SMPSP/Lionsgate/AllstarWho will Villeneuve want to work with? He co-wrote with Jon Spaihts on Dune, with Hampton Fancher and Michael Green on Blade Runner 2049, with Eric Heisserer on Arrival and with Taylor Sheridan on Sicario – on the face of it, he has no sustained partnership in the way Boyle had with Hodge and so he is perhaps not yet married to any high-concept visionary plans, which are going to go over badly when he presents them to Amazon. My guess is that, among these existing writers, he might more instinctively want to work with Sheridan who has certainly shown he can deliver action, thriller-drama and unresolved sexual tension on the “secular” level outside science fiction.But basically, yes,Denis Villeneuveis very good news for Bond: a smart, capable director who is going to produce the bangs for Amazon’s buck and a witty, involving story for the fans.Explore more on these topicsDenis VilleneuveJames BondThrillersAmazon Prime VideoAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The scale of the backbench rebellion was unusually large. Starmer’s team should have seen what was comingThu 26 Jun 2025 13.40 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareMPs and the parliamentary process rarely get a good press. Most citizens do not trust either of them much. As a result, the decline of parliament’s role in national life has been a familiar topicfor decades. Yet, when push comes to shove, as it has done again this week with Labour’s important backbench revolt against the government’s welfare plans, it turns out that MPs actually matter quite a lot.By Thursday morning,more than 120Labour MPs had signalled opposition to the government’s universal credit and personal independence payment bill. With the bill due to be voted on next Tuesday in the House of Commons, and with Labour’s working majority currently standing at 165, that level of rebellion was irresistible. If the bill as it stands had come to a vote, Labour would have lost. This would have been a fundamental humiliation for Sir Keir Starmer, almost a year to the day after Labour was elected.Speaking to journalists two days earlier, Sir Keir had stuck to his guns. There was a “clear moral case” for the bill’s reforms, he insisted. A day later, he dismissed the revolt as “noises off”. Those responses were tin-eared. Back in the Commons on Thursday, the prime minister had toface reality. He admitted talks were now taking place “to get this right”. They would continue over the coming days, so that MPs “can begin making change together on Tuesday”.There were claims on Thursday night that a big climbdown was taking shape. That seems inevitable, but it is not yet clear exactly whatthe changes to be put to MPson Tuesday will be. The rebels say eligibility for disability benefits is being tightened too fiercely, and that the health related element of universal credit is being cut too hard. But ministers remain publicly committed to pressing on and making savings. Finding enough common ground for concessions that will definitively head off a government defeat is hard, since it involves a fundamental clash of approaches.Backbench revolts are a feature of modern politics. Yet this confrontation betweenLabourand its MPs is unusually large by any standards. It is a reminder that big majorities can bring as many headaches as small majorities more obviously do. Above all, it is a reminder that backbench revolts tend to be the visible tip of a larger iceberg of dissatisfaction with a government. Many of the Labour MPs who are challenging the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, over welfare reform would not describe themselves as natural rebels. But their willingness to join a revolt on this major issue should not be dismissed as a one-off. It is likely to represent something broader too.This is why the complaints about the No 10 operation should be taken seriously. Sir Keir’s staff may or may not be “over-excitable boys”, assome complaintshave it, or operate the bunker mentality that is sometimes alleged. The fact is, however, that this revolt wasvisible long ago, but was not addressed in a professional manner.The policy was wrong. The opposition to it was broadly based. But the response of Labour’s parliamentary managers and political strategists was hopeless. They did not take MPs seriously enough. In a manner echoing the wayDominic Cummingsdisplayed such disdain for Tory backbenchers after 2019, Labour ministers and staffers seem to have thought that unhappy MPs do not matter. Sir Keir and his team are discovering just how wrong they were. It serves them right.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Following the 2008 financial crisis, the party talked tough about replacing a failed economic model. But just a year later, its ministers produced a strategy that made clear real change was off the agenda. “The last thing the government wants to do,” theywrotein 2009, “is revive old theories or to invent a new ideology in managing the economy”.Those days are gone. Labour has been carried on the tides of global transformation, and its 2025strategypaper contains a welcome critique of market-led failure – particularly in the areas of regional inequality and energy dependence. What the document also reflects is a long-overdue embrace of a more hands-on state.In advanced manufacturing, the strategy outlines a clear set of interventions that break with economic orthodoxy by re-establishing the government as investor of first resort, risk absorber and catalyst of structural transformation. There is also a substantial turn toward state-led industrial policy inclean energy, aimed at driving investment, shaping markets and coordinating national capabilities. Public investment in this area is slated to reach £30bn a year by 2035. Proposals such as a national wealth fund hint at a more interventionist role for the government, even if the rhetoric remains cautious. These are good ideas.The strategy was sold as alifelinefor energy-heavy industries, with promises of lower electricity prices, but how Treasury relief narrows cost gaps with international competitors remainsunclear. The trouble with the current strategy is that the emphasis on government action is barely telegraphed. What’s bold is barely said; it feels as if the state dares not speak its name.This may be due to message fatigue. Industrial policy has repeatedly surfaced in Tory politics since 2011 – from George Osborne’s “the march of the makers”, to Theresa May’s “modern industrial strategy”, to Boris Johnson’s “levelling up” agenda. These efforts aimed to revive British manufacturing and implied a bigger role for government – but they fell flat, offering slogans not substance. The worry now is that, without the jobs, support for industrial renewal will dry up.Most strikingly, the strategy echoes the state intervention ofJoe Biden– but sidesteps the financial system that underpins Britain’s economic imbalance. In the government strategy, the City remains sacrosanct. But freeing markets won’t help if cash keeps flowing the wrong way. Since the 1980s, prioritising finance has overvalued sterling, gutted manufacturing and driven private debt as capital chases speculation over production. Industrial dynamism also arises from deep cultural and institutional shifts, not just policy tweaks. A real shift means confronting the culture of short-term profits andfinancial hoarding– not just funding “clean” factories. Labour’s strategy does not go there.As a high-income, post-industrial economy, the UK cannot and perhaps should not aim to recreate 20th-century mass manufacturing, which is now dominated by lower-wage economies orheavily subsidised big strategic ones. Instead, the government’s strategy is right to target advanced, high value-added niches such as life sciences or critical segments of the green technology supply chain. Britain won’t succeed without recovering lost economic sovereignty. Labour hints at transformation, but a refusal to confront financial dominance only cements the status quo.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The 23-year-old returns from injury as the most likely catalyst for England’s hopes of remaining European champions because she has the skill and tenacity to be one of the tournament’s standout players.“It helped playing with my brothers all the time,” James says as she reflects on a footballing journey when her prodigious talent has blossomed with Chelsea and England while being tested by insidious abuse and racism. We need two interviews to get a little closer to the tangled heart of her story, but her natural reticence and reluctance to open up deserves respect.Women’s Euro 2025 team guides: ItalyRead moreLauren and Reece James are the first sister and brother to play international football for England and their free-flowing games in the rainy or sunlit park, with Josh and other boys from their neighbourhood, provided the bedrock for her career. She was always the only girl, fighting for the ball before dribbling away on mazy runs, dreaming she was Eden Hazard, while the older boys tried to stop her.A little smile crosses her face when I ask whether her fire was forged in those park games which were as joyous as they were tough. “Yes and sometimes it’s your only option because they’re stronger and quicker than you so your only chance is to be better on the ball. They never went easy on me because they never wanted me to beat them. It was always hard against them.”James started playing seriously when she was “five or six” and believes that those Mortlake days shaped her: “I’d say so because being able to protect the ball obviously helped.”She was fortunate to come from a close-knit family with her parents, Nigel and Emma, pouring so much into their football-crazy children. Her dad is a gifted coach and more than two dozen players have become professional footballers after being guided by him atthe Nigel James Elite Coaching academyin Wimbledon.His philosophy, evident in his daughter’s play, is highlighted on his website: “The Nigel James Elite Coaching programme is about pure ball mastery and delivery with panache, to ultimately create elite technicians of the game.”View image in fullscreenLauren James with her brother Reece at the 2025-26 Chelsea kit launch.Photograph: CFC/Getty ImagesEmma, a nurse for the NHS, spent hours ferrying the kids to and from training and matches. Josh and Reece joined the academies at Fulham and Chelsea and Lauren would be taken to their sessions where, while kicking a ball around on the touchline, her startling gifts were noticed.She began training with Chelsea’s under-10 girls’ team when she was six and at 13 she was signed by Arsenal. As Reece remembered a few years ago: “Me and Lauren played in a number of tournaments together in the same team. We won a lot of tournaments together and it was great playing with her.”James can recall only one tournament with Reece and one or two playing with Conor Gallagher and Jacob Maddox, both future professionals. She shrugs when I ask whether Gallagher, the Atlético Madrid midfielder who has won 21 caps for England, stood out. “When everyone’s young you don’t really notice as much.”Did she face sexism? “Not when I was younger. It was maybe there when I went to Arsenal and trained at the boys’ academy. It took a few sessions because at first they were like: ‘There’s a girl with us.’ But when they got to realise what I could do, they accepted me.”Her years at Arsenal were difficult and in 2023 Nigel spoke in detail toThe Beautiful Game podcast: “She was too good to train with the Arsenal girls when she first went in … so Pedro [Martínez Losa], the manager at the time, brought her in to train with the women.“Your 14-year-old daughter is now training with women who are 35, 28, grown women. People would see this little girl. Some could take it and put their arm around her and some would say: ‘You shouldn’t be here. You should be at school.’“There was a game [where] the manager let her take a penalty. The next day senior players didn’t like it and they asked for her to be removed from the first-team squad and to go back into the academy.“They came up with a solution that she train with the Arsenal academy boys … it was a big thing because it had never happened before – a girl training with the boys – and some parents didn’t like it. But she was superb.”View image in fullscreenLauren James takes part at a McDonald’s Fun Football grassroots event.Photograph: Bumblebee PhotographyOur first interview is at Hanwell Town FC during aMcDonald’s Fun Footballgrassroots programme of free sessions for five to 11-year-olds. “It’s nice to see so many girls playing football on a big pitch,” James says. “With this summer at the Euros, hopefully we can inspire more to play football.”Her presence, both as a brilliant footballer and a young mixed-race woman, clearly inspires the girls from diverse backgrounds who look up to her in Hanwell. But, in an empty dressing room after the session, I ask whether she had felt lonely as a girl playing first-team football with women: “I wouldn’t say lonely. We just didn’t really have much in common … I was just burning to train.”Casey Stoney, who won 130 caps for England, played with James at Arsenal and had been floored by the teenager’stechnical abilityand strength. In 2018, as Manchester United’s manager, Stoney signed the 16-year-old. “She took me to United and took care of me,” James says. “It was difficult, at the start but I got used to it and in our first season we won the Championship [and promotion to the WSL]. I scored quite a few goals.”James scored 22 goals in 40 league games for United between 2018 and 2021, but her success was already shadowed by racism. In February 2021, she wrote apowerful articlein the Daily Telegraph that began: “I’m 19-years-old and I’m sitting here, writing about racist abuse. It is mad. All because of the colour of my skin. I’m proud of my skin, I love my skin colour. But when I saw the comments on my Instagram feed, it hurt.”Lauren JamesShe added: “Racism doesn’t just exist online, of course. It can be in the everyday things – even just going to the supermarket. There are times I’ve been to get my shopping and you get that feeling that people are intimidated by your presence. They’ll move away, pull their children in closer or just look at you in a certain way. It’s difficult to talk about.”It is even more difficult for James to discuss now because of the extreme racism shesuffered onlineafter she was sent off while playing for England against Nigeria in the 2023 World Cup. James hadlit up the tournamentin the group stages, but all her shimmering virtuosity was swamped by horrendous vitriol.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I ask whether she found it difficult to speak out against racism at 19? “Yeah, but it needed to happen.” Has that abuse lessened? “No. I don’t think it gets better … [but] you always live in hope.”James loves playing football, rather than doing interviews, but she still sees value in talking “because it might help the next girl who’s going to be in my position”. She also helps others from diverse backgrounds through her scholarship which in its first year has supported five young girls in London.In our second interview, I ask her what could be done to curb the abuse that she and so many other young women encounter. “Have a break from social media because I don’t think it will go away. Maybe it will die down a bit but, if it won’t, then leave.”It seems wrong the victim should have to disappear. Surely we can all do more to put pressure on social media companies to sanction those who abuse others? “You have those little things on apps where you can report this. But not much gets done. They should take the reports more seriously.”You always need the belief that you’ll make it and be fitJames can sweep aside the negativity through her imperious presence on the pitch. Despite an injury-affected season, her workrate and tracking back have improved dramatically and added a considerable new dimension to her game.HasSonia Bompastor, who replaced Emma Hayes as manager before Chelsea’streble-winning campaign, been instrumental in this development? “She’s added more intensity to us. We have to press a lot more and use a different style of play. She’s added more to my game when I don’t have the ball.”Did James feel some trepidation whenHayes, who had been so influential, left Chelsea to take over the US national team? “It was hard at first but I got used to it and now I’m cool. Emma left Sonia with a top team and she built that winning culture Chelsea are known for. But Sonia is one of the most competitive people I’ve come across. It’s not just about football – whatever it is, she wants to beat you. That gets passed down in the dressing room and in training – always thinking about the next thing we can win.”View image in fullscreenLauren James stands in an ice bath during an England training and recovery session.Photograph: Harriet Lander/FA/Getty ImagesJames points out that Chelsea winning the WSLsix times in a row“is quite amazing” but the need to conquer Europe remains. A hamstring injury meant she missed Chelsea’shumiliationagainst Barcelonain the Champions League semi-final. “I want to be playing, especially in the big games, so it was hard to watch. The 8-2 [aggregate score] makes it sound ridiculous, but we got chances. The difference is they put theirs away. We have just got to keep working and believing in ourselves.”How else has Bompastor improved James as a player? “She’s pushed me because she’s quite demanding. She always wants more which helps you to be better.” Does she like being pushed? “Yes,” James says instantly. She is equally clear when asked whether she targets individual awards such as the Ballon d’Or Féminin. “For sure. You always want to help your team and help them win things, because that plays a part in you winning these individual trophies. That’s certainly one of my aims … hopefully injuries and form help me to stay on track.”James always thought she wouldovercome her hamstring problemin time for the Euros. “The moment you have doubts, you’re putting stress on your body. You need the belief that you’ll make it and be fit. I also looked at the timing and thought: ‘Oh, it’s still a while away.’ That also gave me belief.”The Euros are close now and James’s importance to England is accentuated by the surprise absence of the vastly experiencedMillie Bright,Fran KirbyandMary Earps. Did Bright, her Chelsea captain, tell James of her need tostep away from the pressuresof football? “No, I had no clue. I think everyone is different. Sometimes people may be silent and no one knows what’s going on.”James was a spectator when England beat Germany so memorably in the 2022 European final at Wembley. “It’s not really about defending a title because it’s a completely different team,” she says of England’s squad in Switzerland. “This team’s got a lot of youth in it and this will be some people’s first big tournament.”She also describes “a fresh start, a bit like a new era” and “hungry girls wanting to do well”. Can England win the Euros? “I hope so. We’ll just take it game by game and hopefully have momentum and the belief of the fans and everyone in the country behind us.”There is just time to think once more of those Mortlake days and the blistering games she played with her brothers. Her parents will be in Switzerland to support her, but will Josh and Reece also be watching their little sister? She grins: “I’d like to think so.”They could be in for a treat because, despite the adversity and personal challenges, James is emphatic when asked what she needs to do next to fulfil her potential: “Keep improving, scoring, helping the team and winning competitions.”Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen's Euro 2025Women's footballChelsea WomeninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The manager was delighted.“Everybody gave an incredible performance,” said Guardiola. “It has been a long time since we had a performance like this on and off the ball. The players were committed and we are happy to beat a top side. In the previous two games we won but were miles away. I’m really pleased because the players have to realise [and did today] what we have to do to get back to what we were the last decade.”For the attempt to beat Juve and make it three wins from three games, Rodri was handed a first start since last September’s draw with Arsenal in which he suffered the anterior cruciate ligament injurythat ruled him outuntil the season’s closing moments. He lasted65 minutes.“He’s the best player in the world,” said Guardiola. “He was missed, that was clear. I’m happy hopefully he can help us a lot.”For City’s opener Rodri tapped the ball to Rayan Aït-Nouri, who slipped in Jérémy Doku along the left channel: a sidestep created time and the cleanly struck finish gave Juve’s goalkeeper, Michele Di ­Gregorio, no chance.Yet City’s advantage was ­cancelled out immediately by a careless ­Ederson, whose pass found Teun ­Koopmeiners instead of a teammate. The Dutchman pounced and the goalkeeper’s cheeks went as pink as his strip. It was as clownish as Pierre Kalulu’s contribution when City regained the lead. A lightning Matheus Nunes run was located by Savinho. The right-back zipped the ball over and Kalulu, with no opponent near, panicked and turned the ball in.View image in fullscreenCalamity for Juventus as Pierre Kalulu turns the ball into his own net to restore City’s lead.Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/ReutersAn own goal, sure, but one forced by this far sharper City. A 60-65% first period possession count was potent: Aït-Nouri, Doku, Nunes and Omar Marmoush, at centre-forward, swapped zones across City’s front to cause havoc, the latter’s pirouette-then-shot an illustration. Tijjani Reijnders, from deep, joined in too, serving a slicing ball to Savinho who cut inside but dribbled tamely at Di Gregorio.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The broiled crowd in Orlando – including Thomas Tuchel – appreciated it as much as the players, though the concern in Orange County can be dangerous electrical storms that halt games. But the rain eased, and ­Marmoush’s fierce shot, tipped around a post by Di Gregorio, closed the half.Haaland replaced ­Marmoush and a better-timed stab at Savinho’s cross would have made it 3-1 moments into the second half. The miss spoke of a player who had scored only once from open play in 10 ­previous City appearances. But the statistic soon became two in 11 and completed the ­Norwegian’s landmark third century.Nunes, again, was the provider, another sprint along the right this time ­spotted by Reijnders. The Portuguese rolled the ball to Haaland; he miskicked but it bobbled in, with Di ­Gregorio stranded. The 24-year-old’s second goal of the competition had his team cruising. Juve had faded as any kind of force. The contest continued to take part in their half.Off went Rodri, unscathed, to be replaced by Ilkay Gündogan, and Phil Foden came on for the effervescent Doku. Guardiola’s move became seer-like as City’s fourth was scored by Foden. Haaland galloped through an inside-right zone and passed. Savinho pinged the ball to Foden, who collected his second of thisClub World Cupcalmly from close range. Savinho’s rocket rounded off an emphatic win. Dusan Vlahovic’s late finish for Juve will have annoyed Guardiola – but not for long.Of Haaland’s feat, Guardiola said: “Congrats on 300 goals – it’s good, right? His manager was incredible at football – he scored 11 career goals. I admire him a lot.”Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025JuventusManchester CityClub World CupnewsShareReuse this content"

And, crucially, with the stadium clock at Stade Charléty more than six seconds away from where she had hoped it would be.The 31-year-old Kenyan arrived in Paris stacked with the latest weapons in track and field’s technological arms race. But having reached the bell in 3mins 1sec, just about on schedule, she found that physiology began to overpower technology.Nike PR stunt or giant leap forward? Faith Kipyegon aims to make historyRead moreThere was a consolation of sorts as she finished in 4:06.42 – 1.22 faster than her world record. The new time will not count as she was being paced by men, which is against WorldAthleticsrules.“This was the first trial,” she said. “We are learning many lessons from this race. I will go back to the drawing board to get it right. And I think there is more in the tank.”Before the race Kipyegon’s 13 pacemakers were introduced to the crowd – 11 men and two women. They included several Olympians, the indoor 5,000m world record-holder in the American Grant Fisher, and three Britons, Elliot Giles, Georgia Hunter Bell and Jemma Reekie.Then it was Kipyegon’s turn, tiny at 5ft 2in, dressed all in black. There was a wave to the crowd, a short sprint to whirr the legs up to full speed. Then they were off, ready to tackle the 1,609 metres in front of them.It was Giles who led the way, but to the untrained eye it looked as if he went off a little too fast as it took a while to settle into formation: six athletes in a line in front of Kipyegon, one alongside her, and six behind her. The idea was to allow her to draft and reduce wind resistance.View image in fullscreenFaith Kipyegon was surrounded by 11 male and two female pacemakers in her attempt at Stade Charléty.Photograph: Christophe Ena/APFor a while, her supporters in the Stade Charléty dared to dream. Kipyegon went through the first lap in 1:00.20 and hit 800m in 2:00.75. She still looked to be going strong as she heard the bell in 3:01.84, but then the pain and lactic began to rip through her, and she could run the last lap only in a shade under 65 seconds.The trackside wave lights, which she had used in many of her world records, had been set to get her across the finish line in 3:59.99. This time, though, they kept running further away from her. “I gave everything,” she said. “But I think the wave lights gave everything today too. But maybe next time I can catch up with them.”Few outside Kipyegon’s camp had expected her to emulate Bannister’s epic 1954 feat. But Nike’s executives insisted privately that there was cause for optimism that she could get close. Part of that came from Kipyegon being armed with the latest super shoes, which were lighter at 90g and more propulsive than her previous spikes. On the insoles were written two words: “fastest known”.The Kenyan was also wearing a special skinsuit, designed to help her be more aerodynamic. And she had the team of pacers to help her cut through the air quicker.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That gave executives confidence that Kipyegon could go close.Beforehand they walked around with “I’ve got Faith” T-shirts, with the company’s logo replacing the apostrophe. But faith, it turned out, was not enough. So where does that leave us? The detractors will say it was marketing hype from the beginning. But that isn’t fair. This was a genuine attempt to go where no women had gone before, and Kipyegon should be lauded for rolling the dice and giving it a shot.At the press conference, she was praised by one influencer for shifting the narrative. But her face showed that she had wanted more. “It was not easy but I wanted to prove to the world that everything is possible in life if you dare to try. I am hoping one day, one time, it will come my way.”You could only admire her resolve. But finding those seven seconds will not be easy.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Although he has played some of the best tennis of his life over the past few months, Draper’s preparation for Wimbledon has not been seamless. After being sidelined for a couple of days before last week’s ATP Tour event at Queen’s Club,he ended the tournamentsuffering from tonsillitis.Still, Draper competed extremely well in west London to reach the semi-finals and, with such a short amount of time to acclimatise to the grass, his four matches there will be invaluable to his hopes of making a deep run at Wimbledon. The 23-year-old said he was feeling much better now.“Just been on antibiotics, got over it,” said Draper. “I have been training. Had a couple of days off. Refreshed. I am not sure when I start – Monday or Tuesday – but by then I will be feeling great. I already feel so much better. Got my energy back, that’s for sure. Sometimes you don’t realise how bad you were at the time.”View image in fullscreenJack Draper will have to handle the pressure of increased expectations after swiftly climbing the world rankings.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAHaving started last year’s grass-court season as the world No 40, Draper has enjoyed a remarkable breakthrough year, reaching his first grand slam semi-final at the US Open last year andwinning his first Masters 1000 titleat Indian Wells in March. That success, however, also means dealing with the pressure of following in Andy Murray’s footsteps and being a genuine contender at his home grand slam.“I’m normal, I’m like anyone,” he said. “If anyone asks you how you are going to deal with the pressure, you’re going to think: ‘I can’t control that.’ I focus on what I can control. I can’t control what people say, what noise people say, what hype there is, what criticism, all I can do is try my hardest and focus everyday on what I’m going to do to prepare and play my best tennis in order to try to win the matches.“So I’m really excited to go out there to compete. Full of excitement knowing the crowd is right behind me, that I’m going to be playing on the courts that I wanted to play on since I was young, watching Murray, watching all these great players perform out there and it feels amazing to know that. It’s sinking in that I’m there now and so I’ve got the chance to show people what I can do and I’m really looking forward to seeing what I can do.”Explore more on these topicsJack DraperWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The pair were approaching turn one and Norris ran out of room when trying to take the inside line, clipped the back of Piastri’s car and was edged into the pit wall, sustaining damage that took him out of the race. Piastri went on to finish fourth and the championship leader is 22 points ahead of Norris in the title fight.Brad Pitt in the paddock: how F1 the Movie went deep to keep fans comingRead moreNorris immediately took responsibility for the accident after the race and apologised to Piastri and his team for his misjudgment.Speaking before this weekend’s Austrian Grand Prix, the 11th race of the 24-meeting season, Norris confirmed he and the team engaged in extensive talks about the incident, with the British driver believing it had been a beneficial process.View image in fullscreenLando Norris, in the paddock at the Red Bull Ring racetrack in Austria, revealed he has had ‘not the most joyful’ talks with this team about the incident in Canada.Photograph: Darko Bandić/AP“Not the most joyful conversations but conversations that needed to be had clearly,” he said. “Some very constructive things and in an unfortunate way but a good way I think many things have come out stronger than I would say they were prior to the weekend. Which you might not expect but is a good outcome. Through an unfortunate circumstance a lot has been learned and a lot of things have turned into being stronger than they were before.”Norris confirmed that the rules of engagement atMcLarenremained as they were before the incident and that he and Piastri were on good terms. The drivers are still free to race but clearly greater emphasis has been placed on doing so without taking one another out, a lesson the British driver felt he had taken on board and that he and Piastri were both committed to not jeopardising McLaren’s success by infighting.Quick GuideRussell hints at Verstappen talksShowRussell opens up on contract talksGeorge Russell has suggested his contract renewal talks with Mercedes are being held up because the team are still keen to sign Formula One champion Max Verstappen.The 27-year-old Briton, winner in Canada two weeks ago, is out of contract at the end of the season while four-times champion Verstappen has a deal with Red Bull until 2028, subject to get-out clauses.Russell told Sky Sports television at the Austrian Grand Prix that Mercedes, constructors’ champions eight years in a row from 2014-2021 and currently second to McLaren, wanted to return to the top.“If you’re going to be back on top you need to make sure you’ve got the best drivers, the best engineers, the best pit crew, and that’s what Mercedes are chasing,” he said.“So, it’s only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing. But from my side, if I’m performing as I’m doing, what have I got to be concerned about? There are two seats in every Formula One team.“Mercedes boss Toto Wolff made his interest in Verstappen clear last year as he sought a replacement for seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton.In the end 18-year-old Italian rookie Kimi Antonelli was handed the opportunity and has been setting a string of age records, drawing strong support from fans.ReutersPhotograph: Alessio Morgese/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The trust and the honesty that Oscar and I have for one another, it’s important that we keep it up,” he said. “We stay strong as a team because we don’t want to have the downfall that we know many other teams have had in the past.“We want to race each other fair and hard and on the limit and not have a repeat of what happened last time out and that takes both of us, even though Canada was on me.

But there was only one player everyone wanted to talk to on a balmy evening in Bratislava after the forward’s match-winning displayagainst the Netherlands.Two brilliant goals from Elliott on Wednesday ensured England will face Germany on Saturdaynight as they try to successfully defend the European Under-21 titlewon in 2023. The Liverpool player’s only regret was his ill-advised knee-slide celebration on a “ridiculously dry” pitch for the first of those.‘Crazy experience’: Elliott and Carsley sense England Under-21s have belief to retain EurosRead more“The emotions got the best of me and I’ve hurt my knee from it but who cares?” said Elliott having emerged from the changing room after a mandatory drugs test. “Hopefully I should be fine for the final.”Elliott spent most of the season on Liverpool’s bench after missing several weeks with a foot injury, getting only two Premier League starts – both after the title had been won – but he is making the most of his opportunity to shine for England. Four goals leave him two behindGermany’s 6ft 6in striker Nick Woltemadein the race for the golden boot and underline Elliott’s status as one of Europe’s most promising talents.Elliott cast doubt over his future when he arrived in Slovakia a fortnight ago. Fulham, who sold him toLiverpoolas a 16-year-old for a then record compensation fee of £4.3m, Brighton and Crystal Palace are among the clubs understood to have shown an interest in signing him.“I don’t really want to be wasting years of my career because it’s a short career,” he said. “You don’t know what’s going to happen. I need to reflect. I want to improve and be the best possible version of myself. If that’s to go somewhere else, then it’s a decision I’m going to have to make.”Quick GuideBeadle heading for Birmingham loanShowBirmingham are poised to announce the signing of the England Under-21 goalkeeper James Beadle from Brighton on a season's loan. Beadle, who joined Brighton from Charlton in 2022, has had two previous loans in the Championship with Sheffield Wednesday and made 38 appearances for them last season. He has played every match for England at the European Under-21 Championship in Slovakia and is expected to keep his place for Saturday's final against Germany.Ed AaronsWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and thenew £116m signing Florian Wirtzahead of him, Elliott can hardly be blamed for thinking his opportunities are likely to be limited again next season if he remains at Liverpool. Part of the problem has been his versatility, able to play in several attacking roles and a midfield three, without it being obvious which is his position. Lee Carsley has used him mainly on the right of England’s attack or as a second striker – the position he took up for the superb individual winning goal against the Netherlands.Elliott is one of two squad members who triumphed in Georgia two years ago – the other being the Toulouse defender Charlie Cresswell – although he played only eight minutes of the final after coming on for Cole Palmer.View image in fullscreenHarvey Elliott scores for Liverpool at Brighton in May, with the Premier League title already won.Photograph: John Walton/PA“He was definitely frustrated at the last tournament with the amount of game time he had,” Carsley said. “Him and Charlie, they had to be patient and they showed during the qualifying campaign they were ready to lead and carry the team on along with the other players.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What I have seen is someone who is determined to play and get the minutes. He’s definitely built into the tournament, having not had much game time towards the end of the season.“We’ve had to manage his minutes in terms of the amount he has played and the intensity he plays at. He’s so explosive with the way that he moves and with his end product. We are very lucky to have him.”Elliott may have a decision to make in the coming weeks, although for now his sights are set on leading an inexperienced group to glory in a final when the England senior head coach, Thomas Tuchel, will be present. Reflecting on his role as one of the senior players, the 22-year-old said spending the past six years at close quarters with players such as Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah had been hugely beneficial.“Coming from Liverpool, there’s a lot of leaders in that team,” he said. “Now it’s using my learning, using what I’ve seen the leaders at Liverpool do and how they construct the team. When times are tough, how they bring themselves back up and the team back up.“There’s so many emotions throughout the game: highs, lows, where we feel tired. Just using what I’ve learned and being around to try and keep the guys going, keep the team going.”Explore more on these topicsEngland Under-21sEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Faith Kipyegon aims to make historyRead moreIt follows the controversy around theParis 2024 boxing tournamentafter two athletes – Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-Ting – won gold medals despite having been disqualified from the previous year’s World Championships for allegedly failing to meet gender eligibility criteria.World Boxing, which has since been recognised by the IOC as the sport’s international federation, has introduced mandatory sex testing and said Khelif would not be able to compete in the female category until she undergoes the test. Khelif has always insisted she was born a woman, has lived as a woman and has competed as a woman.The IOC faced criticism for its handling of the row in Paris and for a perceived failure to lead on this issue more widely. Coventry indicated that the IOC would not revisit the allocation of medals from Paris and said the organisation wanted to “look forward” and not back.Announcing the shift in policy, Coventry said: “There was overwhelming support that we should protect the female category. And with that, we will set up a working group made up of experts and international federations.“It was agreed by the members that the IOC should take a leading role in this,” she added. “And that we should be the ones to bring together the experts and the international federations and ensure that we find consensus.“We understand that there will be differences depending on the sports. But it was fully agreed that as members that, as the IOC, we should make the effort to place emphasis on protection of the female category.”Coventry’s remarks followed two days of “Pause and Reflect” workshops in Lausanne, where the new IOC president spoke to members about their concerns and how to push the organisation forward.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That day, he rode a double at Royal Ascot, on Arabian Story in the Britannia Stakes and Never So Brave in the Buckingham Palace Stakes.The collision on 27 April involved a grey Mercedes A Class vehicle that left the road near Hermitage, west Berkshire, and crashed into a tree.Murphy, the champion Flat jockey four times between 2019 and 2024, has ridden 49 winners in the current championship race, 17 clear of his nearest rival.Murphy rode a treble at Leicester on 26 April but missed four booked rides at Southwell the following day. The stewards’ report for the meeting at Southwell listed “travel issues for Murphy” as the reason.He was back in the saddle at Windsor on 28 April, with two winners from five rides, and has subsequently won races including the Group One Lockinge Stakes at Newbury in May, on John & Thady Gosden’s Lead Artist, in addition to five winners at Royal Ascot last week.Murphy has five booked rides at Doncaster on Friday and six on a valuable card at York on Saturday.The British Horseracing Authority, the sport’s regulator, issued a statement on Thursday that said it “is aware of an update issued by Thames Valley police this afternoon regarding Mr Oisin Murphy”. The statement continued: “We are now seeking to gather as much information as possible in order to consider what, if any, implications there are as a result of this development.”Murphy is due to appear at Reading magistrates court on 3 July.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

Others say the law is not to blame, but the states that are supposed to uphold itByLinda KinstlerThu 26 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 05.54 EDTShareIn late April, terroristskilled 26 civiliansin the Indian town of Pahalgam, located in the mountainous border region of Kashmir. India swiftly blamed Pakistan for the attack, launched missile strikes towards it and announced that it was suspending the Indus waters treaty, effectively threatening to cut off three-quarters of Pakistan’s water supply.Ahmad Irfan Aslam, a seasoned international lawyer who, until last year, was Pakistan’s minister for law and justice, water and natural resources, climate change and investments, watched the news unfold with a creeping sense of horror. India was raising the possibility that it could turn off the tap for 250 million people. This would violate not only the treaty, but alsointernational lawsaround the equitable use of water resources.Colleagues and friends approached Aslam for guidance about what could be done. That’s when it struck him: “I had this scary realisation that there isn’t much one can do today,” he told me. “We have witnessed a sudden erosion of multilateral institutions, of institutional norms. Everything seems uncertain.” Even if Pakistan were to bring a complaint to one of the institutions created to settle disputes between states – the UN security council and general assembly, the international court of justice (ICJ) or the permanent court of arbitration – whatever decision that resulted would almost certainly not be respected. “International law has always depended on the good faith of nation states,” Aslam said. “And that good faith has eroded.”In 2024, Aslam had experienced a similarly unsettling feeling in The Hague, where he represented Pakistan at the ICJ, in a proceeding about Israel’s ongoing occupation ofPalestinian territoriesin the West Bank. “Israel’s occupation is unlawful and unlawfulness must have consequences,” he told the court. There were 52 countries participating in the proceedings, and when Aslam spoke with many of his colleagues, “there was an acute realisation that none of this is actually going to change anything on the ground”. Perhaps what they told the judges would mean something to future historians, but their words would do nothing to prevent the immediate suffering of Palestinians. “No matter what court you approach, you are not going to get justice,” he said. “And civilians are caught up in this web of geopolitics that is not of their own making.”Over the past decade, key institutions upholding the international order have been diminished, crippled or compromised. The recent US withdrawal from a vast array of international organisations and agreements – the Paris climate accords, the World Health Organization, the UN human rights council – has further damaged the system;US sanctionson the international criminal court (ICC) have undermined the court’s credibility and created serious financial obstacles to its investigations of war crimes in Ukraine and Gaza. The UN security council has been deadlocked for well over a decade, thanks to the veto power of its permanent members.Trump’s threats to occupy Greenland and Canada and to seize the Panama canal have further undermined the already frayed edifice of international law. “Even raising the possibility of these clearly illegal actions does harm to the legal norm, because it makes them thinkable,” said Oona Hathaway, professor of international law at Yale. Days after the US followed Israel in conducting unlawful airstrikes on nuclear sites in Iran,Hathaway arguedthat Trump’s actions threatened “to reshape the global legal order, transforming it from one governed by law to one governed by might”.But the erosion of international law began long before Trump first took power in 2017. The relevance, and even the very existence, of international law has been up for debate since the moment it emerged almost two centuries ago. Its champions argue that it is the bulwark against another great war, a restraint against criminality and mass violence. Its critics argue that, far from shielding the world from the worst crimes, it has instead protected states by providing them with a language with which to justify their wrongs. International lawyers are themselves divided over whether their discipline is alive and well, in hibernation, in its death throes, or long ago deceased, a“moral ghost”that hovers over the world map.Wandering round The Hague, it can feel less like a city and more like a collection of symbols. To walk through its streets is to repeatedly encounter the ruins of prior attempts to establish world peace. The building that once housed the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia sits just in front of the international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine. The Iran-US claims tribunal, set up in the aftermath of the Tehran hostage crisis of 1979 and still going, is a 10-minute walk up the road, while the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is headquartered just a few metres away. These institutions have little to do with one another in terms of law, but being located together in The Hague gives them a “patina of legitimacy”, as one international lawyer told me. The ICC is located in the north-east corner of the city, just down the road from the detention centre where its defendants are housed. (Current occupants include the former Philippine presidentRodrigo Duterteand the Central African rebel leader Alfred Yekatom.) The closer one gets to the Peace Palace, the seat of the ICJ, the more placid and verdant the city becomes.These institutions are physical embodiments of the discipline known as “international law”, though scholars tend to disagree on what international law actually is. In place of an answer, one is confronted with a series of metaphors: one lawyer told me that it is “like gravity: you don’t see it, but it’s there”. Others have compared it to spelling in the English language (the rules can seem made up); to pornography (you know it when you see it); to a body of water (it does not stand still); to a comedy (it can defy reason); to a tragedy (all too often, everyone loses). The novelist Shirley Hazzard once described it rather more cynically, as a “beaut racket”. Its constituent materials, according to ICJ statute, include treaties, conventions, customs and cases, as well as “general principles of law recognised by civilised nations” and “teachings of the most highly qualified” experts.View image in fullscreenProtesters in India condemning the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam in April.Photograph: Dibyangshu Sarkar/AFP/Getty ImagesBut to speak of international law as merely a set of rules and agreements is to elide its function as the “lingua franca of the international system”, and as a means of expressing the belief that perpetrators of global crimes should be punished just as domestic offenders are, and (more often) of expressing incredulity when they are not. (International law has become the vernacular of the “educated middle classes”, as the LSE professor of law Gerry Simpson put it. “When I go to dinner parties, people speak international law to me all the time,” he told me.) To speak of “international law” is to conjure up a particular set of images: the German high command awaiting sentencing at Nuremberg; war criminals and genocidaires on trial in The Hague. These are episodes ofinternational criminal law, the youngest and most fragile branch of international law, and the one that is most fiercely argued over by politicians, the media and the public.Today, there is a growing sense in the field that international criminal law is a failed project, “a dead man walking”. Few of the lawyers I spoke with were willing to defend it without caveat. “The gap between the aspirations of international criminal law and the reality for people on the ground is greater and greater,” said Adil Haque, a law professor at Rutgers University. “And that is a problem for the law, because law is supposed to achieve things in the real world.”The creation of the ICC in 1998 was the realisation of the most romantic aspirations of international law: holding perpetrators of emblematic crimes to account whenever their own nations failed to do so. The court opened its doors at a unique and perhaps unreplicable moment in international relations, when the world’s powers were still enjoying the afterglow of the end of the cold war. “In retrospect, it was this weird period of history where a lot of the sovereignty and security concerns that big powers have were somewhat reduced,” said David Bosco, a journalist and academic who has spent decades covering the court. “That allowed for a project like the ICC to get off the ground in a way that it would not have in any other period.”That period turned out to be short-lived. The ICC, which has an annual operating budget of approximately €200m, could never fully live up to the aspirations that ushered it into being. In its 23-year history, it has only delivered 11 convictions, all of which have been for crimes committed on the African continent. (Because of the court’s perceived focus on trying African defendants, member states of the African Union have repeatedly threatened to withdraw from theRome statute, the ICC’s founding treaty.) “There is a neocolonial aura about [the ICC] which is hard to shake,” the Finnish legal scholar and former diplomat Martti Koskenniemi told me. In his view, the court was a product of the “liberal hubris” of the 1990s, the result of a system that had been seduced by its own idealism.Since its founding, the ICC has been accused of being a vehicle for victor’s justice, a “fake court” in the eyes of its detractors. The recent arrest of Duterte, while a significant victory for the court,will be challengedon the grounds that the Philippines formally withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019. (The ICC pre-trial chamber has said that its investigation into Duterte’s drug war crimes only pertained to actions committed prior to that date.) And while the court’s arrest warrants for Russian president Vladimir Putin and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu are important symbolic gestures, the chance that either indictment ever results in a trial is virtually zero. Russia and Israel have joined the US, Syria and China in refusing to become a state party to the Rome statute, effectively denying the court authority to try its citizens. (Earlier this year, Hungary notified the UN that it would be joining this club, by withdrawing from the ICC while hosting Netanyahu in Budapest.)View image in fullscreenThe Peace Palace, seat of the international court of justice in The Hague.Photograph: Ankor Light/AlamyThe US’s commitment to undermining the court runs deep. A month after the court was officially founded, Congress passed a law known as the “Hague Invasion Act”, giving the president the power to use “all means necessary” to release a US government official detained by the ICC. When, in 2017, ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda attempted to open an investigation into atrocities allegedly committed by US personnel in Afghanistan, she wasdenied a visato enter the US, and the court was threatened with economic sanctions. The investigation was ultimately dropped as a result of pressure from the Trump administration. Bensouda was more recently tasked with investigating alleged genocide in Palestine, an assignment for which she faced“direct threats” to her person and family.The high-profile arrest warrants for Putin and Netanyahu may have raised the court’s profile, but they have also underscored its impotence and attracted potentially fatal countermeasures from the US. “Paradoxically,” the international lawyer Chantal Meloni told me, “the minute the court shows that it has teeth might be the end of the court.”The criticisms of international law are familiar and, in some sense, impossible to deny: that it is too weak, that it is selectively applied, that it is merely an extension of state power. “We are all prisoners of this horizontal system, where states have to keep each other in check, and that will inevitably fall subject to politicisation,” Yusra Suedi, a lecturer at the University of Manchester, told me. It is essentially an opt-in system: weak states that flout its directives are called pariahs or rogues; powerful states that do so are called hegemons.For critics of the field, the problem is not just that law doesn’t stop wars or protect civilians, but also that it offers a vocabulary for states to justify the unchecked use of force. Breaches are not the exception but the rule. For instance, international humanitarian law restricts the use of certain kinds of weapons, such as cluster bombs, that are “indiscriminate by nature, capable of causing harm without distinguishing between combatants and civilians”. That did not stop Israel, whichfirst ratifiedthe convention on certain conventional weapons in 1995, from deploying cluster bombs against a civilian population in 2006, during the Lebanon war. (Israel, like the US, Russia, Iran and China, refused to sign the 2008 convention on cluster munitions.) More than 1,000 people were killed, approximately one-third of whom were children. The Israelimilitary claimedthat the use of cluster bombs was not a violation of international law, because they were focused on military targets and because the population of Beirut’s southern suburbs, an area called Dahiya, had been warned of the attack in advance.It was during that conflict that Israeli forces developed what is now known as the “Dahiya doctrine”, which permits the use of “disproportionate” force against civilian population centres in certain circumstances. The attack on Dahiya was a blatant violation of what is known as the“principle of proportionality”in international law, which holds that civilians may not be attacked if the result is “excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”. The UN human rights council formeda commissionto look into the event, which concluded that “there was no justification” for the use of cluster bombs.Every scholar who laments the waning of international law will have their own moment when the rot set in. In Koskenniemi’s view, it came in the 1960s when its original goals of peace and justice started to be displaced by the administrative and managerial imperatives of globalisation. For the Israeli legal scholar Itamar Mann, Dahiya felt like the beginning of the end of international law as a credible system for preventing atrocities. “They weren’t just ignoring the rule: they were invoking it for the very purposes that it was supposed to limit or control,” he said. By attempting to justify a legally unjustified action in the language of international law,Israelmade a mockery of the spirit and letter of the law. “In general, that was the moment when the idea that an entire neighbourhood can be eliminated, or close to that, came on the radar,” said Mann. As we spoke about the condition of international law writ large, he slipped into the past tense: “It was a way of challenging brute uses of force, and that is no longer there.”View image in fullscreenGaza in June.Photograph: Khaes Alrefi/Anadolu/Getty ImagesInvocations of international law as cover for violations of its own order have contributed to perceptions that the discipline is in decline. Russia, for example, took pains to offer legal arguments for its invasion of Ukraine in 2014. In a document seeking to justify its 7 October attack on Israel, Hamas referred to anICJ opinionabout the construction of a wall on occupied Palestinian land and called for states to “uphold their responsibilities towards the international law”. Meanwhile, Israeli politicians have frequently invoked international law as a shield and an alibi for the continuation of the war in Gaza. It is either a sign that something is deeply wrong with the international system, or a sign that it is working as it should, that a state like North Korea took the trouble toaccuse Israelof committing an “unpardonable crime against humanity” by attacking Iran.Gerry Simpson began his career as a believer in international law and its power, and wrote articles making institutional proposals for new committees and the like. Now he sees that approach as misguided. Part of the discipline’s problem, he argues, is that international law, like any belief system, is at its core merely a collection of words, and those words have lost touch with the realities they are meant to describe: “Does anyone think ‘serious violations of the laws of war’ captures the essence of bodily and mental harm caused by explosive devices or torture?” he writes in his recent book, The Sentimental Life of International Law.“Many people are trying to hold on to a legal system that is decreasingly available to us,” said Monica Hakimi, a former state department lawyer who is now professor of international law at Columbia. “You don’t want to just throw up your hands and give up on the international legal norms that have forestalled massive wars and protected individual rights. But I think we are not quite thinking through the kinds of compromises that we will need to make if we are to stop the most dangerous trend lines that we’re seeing.”A reckoning with the failures of the field and the sclerosis of its institutions, several lawyers told me, is long overdue. “It would be a foolish person who would say that the UN, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as they are currently structured are fit for purpose to take us through to the end of the century,” said Sir Daniel Bethlehem, the former legal adviser to the UK Foreign Office. “I cannot imagine getting out of the quagmire of Sudan, or DRC, or Israel-Gaza, or Ukraine, by simply putting one foot in front of the other.” Hehas advocatedfor a long-term rethinking of the form and content of the international system. If we are to find our way out of the current crisis, he argues, “there is an urgent need to re-engineer, to reconfigure”.For true believers in the field, there is no crisis in international law. Dire Tladi, a widely respected South African legal scholar who, last year, was appointed as a judge at the ICJ, assured me that international law was not in decline. It continued to exist as a “neutral set of rules that is supposed to apply to relations between states, and it’s supposed to apply without ‘fear or favour’”, he said. When I pointed out that the words “supposed to” were bearing a lot of weight in that formulation, Tladi responded:“Voilà.”Tladi is clear-eyed about the limitations of his work. In his legal opinions, he has taken a stridently realist tone. Last May, in a a declaration regarding South Africa’ssuit against Israelfor alleged violations of the genocide convention, he wrote that “there are no more words to describe the horrors in Gaza”, and explained that the court had ordered Israel to halt its military operations and had demanded that Hamas release the hostages. “But,”he concluded, “the court is only a court!” His own words, and those of his colleagues, could only do so much. The law was issuing directives and making judgments, but they were falling on closed ears. No advisory opinion can make a tank reverse course.The point, Tladi argues, is that what we are witnessing today is not the failure of international law but rather the failure of international politics. “The law is there,” he said, but “gaps in international law have often been used as a basis for non-accountability”. And even where gaps do not exist – “There’s no debate about the fact that you are not allowed to commit genocide,” Tladi said – international politics and power have frequently blunted the force of international law. “You cannot ignore the influence of power on lawmaking,” he said. (As a sitting judge, Tladi could not talk about ongoing cases.)When I spoke to Raji Sourani, the director of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, who fled Gaza with his family after their home was blown up in late October 2023, he offered a similarly strident defence of international law. He rattled off a list of victories: the ICJ had acknowledged that a plausible genocide was unfolding in Gaza and had issued six provisional measures commanding Israel to restrict its use of force and uphold the genocide convention; the ICC had issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant; almost 100 Israeli soldiers arebeing investigatedfor war crimes in at least 14 countries under the principle of universal jurisdiction.“The problem is not international law,” Sourani said. “We made the best use of it that we could, for the sake of the rule of law and the dignity of man, and to protect civilians.” The problem, he said, lay with states who suggested that international law need not be consistently applied. He and his Palestinian colleagues “were very happy when they talked about the Ukrainian right to self-determination and independence”, Sourani told me. Those same standards need to be applied everywhere, he said. “You cannot be real democracies when you are selective in deciding to whom international law applies.”For Leila Sadat, a former ICC special adviser and prolific scholar, the critics of international law bear some responsibility for the crippled state of the field. By constantly raising the question of its relevance and even its very existence, they opened the system up to cynicism, attack and manipulation. When she started working on the ICC, she desperately wanted to make it more effective. But, she said, “It never occurred to me to challenge the entire concept that individuals should be held accountable for the commission of mass atrocities.”For Sourani, debates over international law are anything but academic. “We believe in justice, dignity of man, the rule of law, human rights,” he said. “These are not just words. These are the lives of people, the blood and pain and suffering of people.” Earlier that day, he had managed to call a friend who is still inGaza. The friend said he could no longer look his wife and children in the eyes, because he could not find anything to feed them. “He said to me: ‘Raji, I have a dream. I want to die.’”Where does international law go from here? The field is cyclical, Suedi told me. “Sometimes it takes terrible events to awaken humanity to the depths of our actions, prompting us to reflect, redeem ourselves, and to go back to our fundamental values.” We are now in a period of downturn: international law will not disappear, but its institutions will probably continue to lose credibility and their rulings will carry less weight. The degradation of international law will be accompanied by a parallel erosion of the rule of lawwithinstates. “It’s easy to take potshots at international law, it’s easy to say that none of it is enforceable, that it’s all a joke,” Sadat told me. “We are now seeing what happens when a president [Trump] attacks domestic law. All law depends on a system of good faith, including national law.”China has slowly begun to take up the role that the US once played in international institutions, recasting the law in its image. While the US has leaned away from multilateral forums, China is leaning in. “They go to all the meetings of the ICC; they participate in the system,” said Sadat. In the absence of US participation, she predicted, “a China-led international legal system is what we are likely to get”.A China-led international law will probably be one in which the protection of human rights and the distribution of aid are downgraded, and respect for state borders elevated. “The jealous protection of state sovereignty” is the principle around which Chinese foreign policy revolves, said Julian Ku, a professor of law at Hofstra University. “And the UN is a forum for them to market this view to other developing nations – they want to make common cause with nations who are sick of being lectured by Europeans, Americans, by NGOs.” (“It is no surprise that authoritarian nations in Africa prefer China as a hegemon,” said Hakimi.)So far, however, the Chinese-led international order looks like it will be no more consistent than the version that preceded it. “Everybody is walking in different directions: China is very interested in sovereignty and territorial integrity, but they are not doing a lot to help Ukraine,” said Ku. “Turkey has been occupying Cyprus pretty much for 60 years, and people just kind of got used to it.” China’s UN representative recently said that US strikes on Iranhad damagedthe country’s credibility in international negotiations, and Chinese state media chided the US for playing “power politics” at the expense of international law.Over the next few years, it is likely that the thick layer of international treaties and agreements that has governed the past several decades will continue to erode. In late June, Indian home affairs ministerAmit Shahannounced that his country will “never” restore the Indus waters treaty, and that “Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably”.Yet Ahmad, the former Pakistani minister, told me that despite the current state of his field, he remains a hopeless optimist, at least in the long term. “To every force, there is a counter force,” he said. “For every genocide happening, there will be counter litigation to hold those accountable.” Every proceeding must result in a judgment. “Will those judgments be enforced? No. Will that mean that the system has collapsed? No. Those judgments may be unimportant and irrelevant today, but they will come up again, and they matter.”Only a crisis, Ahmad believes, will compel humanity to come together, to redevelop global institutions, and to re-engage with international law. The crisis that might ultimately bring about a re-invigoration of international law, he told me, is not Israel-Palestine, or Russia-Ukraine, or the threatened annexation of Greenland, or the erosion of multilateral institutions. It is climate change. “Over the next seven years, international law willrespond to climate change, and that will trickle down to other aspects of the field – trade investment first, and then eventually to things like territorial integrity and ICC proceedings.”‘All other avenues have been exhausted’: Is legal action the only way to save the planet?Read moreLast year, an unprecedented number of states participated in climate crisis proceedings at the ICJ, and the judges are now working on an advisory opinion on state obligations to protect the environment. “If you read the scientific reports, they clearly tell us that we are not winning [the fight against climate breakdown],” Tladi told me. “Either the law is not sufficient, or the law is not being applied.”The field of international law has always been a dynamic system, and it has to evolve alongside the world that it seeks to govern. “International law will be fine, but it will reflect the state of the world,” Tladi said. “So the question is, what will the world look like?”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readInternational lawIndiaPakistanBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelGazafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s so good,” he said. But he made no mention of his desire to sign the legislation by next Friday – the US Independence Day holiday – instead encouraging his audience to contact their lawmakers to get the bill over the finish line.“If you can, call your senators, call your congressmen. We have to get the vote,” he said.Democrats have dubbed the bill the “big, ugly betrayal”, and railed against its potential cut to Medicaid, the federal healthcare program for low-income and disabled people. The legislation would imposethe biggest funding cutto Medicaid since it was created in 1965, and cost an estimated 16 million people their insurance.It would also slash funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), which helps Americans afford food.Republicans intend to circumvent the filibuster in the Senate by using the budget reconciliation procedure, under which they can pass legislation with just a majority vote, provided it only affects spending, revenue and the debt limit. But on Thursday, Democrats on the Senate budget committee announced that the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, had ruled that a change to taxes that states use to pay for Medicaid was not allowed under the rules of reconciliation.That could further raise the cost of the bill, which the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation recently estimated would add a massive $4.2tn to the US budget deficit over 10 years. Such a high cost may be unpalatable to rightwing lawmakers in the House, who are demanding aggressive spending cuts, but the more immediate concern for the GOP lies in the Senate, where several moderate lawmakers still have not said they are a yes vote on the bill.“I don’t think anybody believes the current text is final, so I don’t believe anybody would vote for it in it’s current form. We [have] got a lot of things that we’re working on,” the senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a top target of Democrats in next year’s midterm elections, told CNN on Wednesday.In an interview with the Guardian last week, the Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski declined to say how she would vote on the bill, instead describing it as “a work in progress” and arguing that the Senate should “not necessarily tie ourselves to an arbitrary date to just get there as quickly as we can”.Democrats took credit for MacDonough’s ruling on the Medicaid tax, with the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, saying the party “successfully fought a noxious provision that would’ve decimated America’s healthcare system and hurt millions of Americans. This win saves hundreds of billions of dollars for Americans to get healthcare, rather than funding tax cuts to billionaires.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicansUS domestic policyUS SenateUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

The ONS refused to amend the figure, arguing that investors who bought inflation-linked financial products would claim compensation.The acting national statistician, Emma Rourke, said the report marked “a turning point for the ONS as we commit to implement the recommendations and reset towards a culture that embraces feedback and challenge”.The ONS has also published a £10m plan to improve the accuracy of itseconomic and population statistics. It said improving the accuracy of ONS statistics will take collective effort.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is not a sign of failure, but of a statistical system willing to evolve, led by evidence, and open about how it improves.“We will work closely with users to ensure revisions and breaks in series are well managed, with support provided to users.”Devereux said senior managers had become focused on delivering new IT systems, diverting resources from existing system upgrades.“There has been a commendable interest in both new approaches to statistics (including the use of administrative data) and ensuring the relevance of ONS activity to wider political debate,” he said. “Unfortunately, this has had the (unintended) effect of de-prioritising the less exciting, but nonetheless crucial, task of delivering core economic statistics of sufficient quality to guide decision making.”For instance, problems with trade data “reflected known concerns” about flaws in the computer system used to compile the figures, but nothing was done about it until an error occurred. The producer price index, which measures the cost of raw materials and components used in industry, was flawed after staff stuck with old coding methods, reducing their ability to spot errors, said Devereux.In 2020, the ONS shifted publication of economic statistics from 9.30am to 7am. Concerns that this put added pressure on staff to verify and comment on data outside office hours sparked a review by the statistics regulator. The review found a move back to 9.30am would not be possible, in part because of the weakness of the IT systems.Explore more on these topicsOffice for National StatisticsEconomicsBank of EnglandWalesNewportCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

Policy analyst Fiona Hill has argued that a third world war is in effect already under way.Donald Trump has continued to challenge the post-war consensus, withdrawn the US from the Paris climate accord and, with help from the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, shuttered the development agency USAID. Musk is poised to become the world’s first trillionaire by 2027,according to one report.“Volatility orders our world today,” the letter states. “Inequality spirals across nations. Trillionaires could emerge this decade, while near half of humanity lives in poverty. 3.3 billion people live in countries that spend more on interest to pay sovereign debt than on education or health.“Climate breakdown outpaces green transitions. Across too many places, children are being buried under states’ belligerence as any sense of a rules-based order is violently displaced by a power-based one. The multilateralism to solve global problems that grew out of two World Wars is in disarray. Global problems that need global solutions and cannot be solved by nation states on their own remain unaddressed.”The world is falling short in multilateral cooperation and the financing of global development aid, the former leaders warn, leading to more poverty, ill health, illiteracy and environmental problems.In what some observers may interpret as a swipe at Trump, who has attacked organisations such asNato, the United Nations and World Health Organization, the letter states: “Alone, any one country – and its people – is left vulnerable when another chooses narrow unilateralism above all else. We need international cooperation, revamped for our era.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Employment dropped by more than 100,000 in May, markingthe largest monthly fall in PAYE payrollssince the same period in 2020 during the first Covid lockdown.Annual earnings in the private sector grew by 5.1% in the three months to April, down from 5.9% in the three months to January.Bailey said: “The latest intelligence from the Bank’s agents continue to suggest average pay settlements for 2025 of 3.5 to 4.0%, closer to levels consistent with the inflation target.”Earlier this month six members of the MPC voted to keep rates on hold while three supported a reduction to 4%. The split was widely seen as an indication of the pressure growing for a rate cut in August. Financial markets expect two further cuts in interest rates this year to 3.75%.Bailey said the underlying growth of the economy was weak and likely to remain subdued for the rest of the year while businesses coped with the uncertainty created by US import tariffs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These price increases are to an extent idiosyncratic, with reports of reductions in cattle herds and climate-related disruptions to coffee and cocoa production.“But our agency intelligence also highlights labour costs and costs related to new packaging regulation as wider factors at play. And, like energy prices, food prices are salient to consumers. We have to make sure that these increases do not feed through to second-round effects either.”Bank officials have been concerned that high levels of wages growth and extra costs on employers from higher taxes will feed through into higher prices, maintaining inflation above 3%.

However, it remains too early to say if the development of resistance in the ash trees can outpace the destruction being caused by the ash dieback fungus.The genetic analysis is also a scientific breakthrough. It is the first convincing proof of a prediction made by Charles Darwin that significant changes in organisms can result from natural selection driving very many small changes, not just from one or two obvious ones.Ash dieback is caused by the invasiveHymenoscyphus fraxineusfungus, which was first identified in the UK in 2012 and is also killing trees across Europe. It haskilled millions in the UKand is expected to wipe out up to 85% of the older, non-resistant ash trees, incurringcosts of £15bn.View image in fullscreenAsh trees killed by ash dieback on the South Downs in West Sussex, UK.Photograph: Andy Soloman/AlamyPrevious studies found apparent resistance in some ash saplings but the new study gives in-depth genetic information that could help breeding programmes to support the natural recovery of ash trees.“Our new findings give us new hope,” said Prof Richard Buggs, at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew and Queen Mary University of London (QMUL): “Elm trees have struggled to evolve to Dutch elm disease, but ash produce an abundance of seedlings upon which natural selection can act when they are still young. Through the death of millions of ash trees, a more resistant population of ash is appearing.”Prof Richard Nichols, also at QMUL, said: “We have to be cautious. We can’t say the ash is saved, but we are in a position to say it’s looking promising. We are watching evolution happen and what’s remarkable is that it’s happening so quickly, in a single generation.” One ash tree can produce 10,000 genetically distinct seeds in one season, leading to scores of saplings.The study,published in the journal Science, compared the DNA of trees that were already growing before ash dieback’s arrival with younger trees that were established after.The new trees have to grow up through the leaf mould where the fungus replicates and the researchers found that about 30% of these were killed by ash dieback, providing a strong driving force for evolution. “Only the fittest survive – those that made it through that intense early episode of selection,” said Nichols.Previous genetic work had identified thousands of locations in ash DNA that appeared to either protect the trees from dieback, or make them more vulnerable. The scientists recorded subtle changes at these locations, showing the younger generation possessed greater resistance than their predecessors.This showed that the DNA changes predicted whether saplings were more likely to flourish or die and therefore demonstrated that Darwinian evolution by natural selection was taking place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Felling and destroying infected trees would mean important genetic variability was lost.Rebecca Gosling, of the Woodland Trust, which owns Marden Park woods in Surrey, where the study took place, said: “The findings highlight how vital it is to support natural regeneration in woodlands, furthering our understanding of how to best manage our ash woodlands.”“However, natural selection alone may not be enough to produce fully resistant trees,” said Dr Carey Metheringham, at QMUL. “The existing genetic variation in the ash population may be too low, and as the trees become scarcer, the rate of selection could slow.”Therefore, human interventions may also be required to support ash tree recovery, the researchers said. This could include selective breeding for resistant varieties, cross-breeding with Asian ash trees, which evolved with the fungus and are therefore highly resistant, or even gene editing.Explore more on these topicsAsh diebackTrees and forestsInvasive speciesEvolutionBiologyConservationEndangered speciesnewsShareReuse this content"

Working first at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research and more recently at the University of São Paulo, he is a global authority on tropical forests and how they could be restored. In this interview, he explains the triple threat posed by the climate crisis, agribusiness and organised crime.View image in fullscreenCarlos Nobre fears that the world is not acting with enough urgency.Photograph: Victor Moriyama/The GuardianWhat is the importance of the Amazon?As well as being incredibly beautiful, the world’s biggest tropical rainforest is one of the pillars of the global climate system, home to more terrestrial biodiversity than anywhere else on the planet, a major influence on regional monsoon patterns and essential for agricultural production across much of South America.You were the first scientist to warn that it could hit a tipping point. What does that mean?It is a threshold beyond which the rainforest will undergo an irreversible transformation into a degraded savannah with sparse shrubby plant cover and low biodiversity. This change would have dire consequences for local people, regional weather patterns and the global climate.At what level will the Amazonhit a tipping point?We estimate that a tipping point could be reached if deforestation reaches 20-25% or global heating rises to 2.0-2.5C [above preindustrial levels].What is the situation today?It is very, very serious. Today, 18% of the Amazon has been cleared and the world has warmed by 1.5C and is on course to reach 2.0-2.5C by 2050.How is this being felt now?The rainforest suffered record droughts in 2023 and 2024, when many of the world’s biggest rivers were below the lowest point on record. That was the fourth severe drought in two decades, four times more than would have been expected in an undisrupted climate.Every year, the dry season is becoming longer and more arid. Forty-five years ago, the annual dry season in the southern Amazon used to last three to four months and even then there would be some rain. But today, it is four to five weeks longer and there is 20% less rain. If this trend continues, we will reach a point of no return in two or three decades. Once the dry season extends to six months, there is no way to avoid self-degradation. We are perilously close to a point of no return. In some areas, it may have already been passed. In southern Pará and northern Mato Grosso, the minimum rainfall is already less than 40mm per month during the dry season.Aren’t those the areas where the most forest has been cleared for cattle ranching and soy plantations?Yes. Livestock grazing is a form of ecological pollution. The areas that have been most degraded by pastures are at, or very close to, a tipping point. That is all of the southern Amazon – more than 2m sq km – from the Atlantic all the way to Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. Scientific studies show degraded pastures recycle only one-third or one-fourth as much water vapour as a forest during the dry season.View image in fullscreenPeople walk along the dried up bed of the Solimões River in Brazil, which goes on to form the Amazon River.Photograph: Raphael Alves/EPAThere is so much water in the Amazonian soil. Trees with deep roots bring it up and release it into the air, mostly through transpiration by the leaves. In this way, forests recycle 4-4.5 litres of water per square metre per day during the dry season. But degraded land, like pastures, recycles only 1-1.5 litres. That helps to explain why the dry seasons are growing one week longer every decade.Why isn’t an Amazoniansavannah a good idea?It would be less humid and more vulnerable to fire. The tropical forest generally has 20-30% more annual rainfall than tropical savannahs in Venezuela, Colombia, Bolivia andBrazil. The Amazon also has fewer lightning strikes because the clouds are lower than in the savannah. But the most important difference is the fact that a rainforest has a closed canopy so only 4% of solar radiation reaches the forest floor. This means there is always very little radiated energy for the evaporation of the water so the forest floor vegetation and soil are very wet. Historically, this means that lightning strikes only start very small fires that kill only one or two trees but do not spread. In evolutionary terms, this is one reason why there is so much biodiversity in the rainforest; it is resilient to fire. But once it starts to dry and degrade, it is easier to burn.How would an Amazontipping point affect the global climate?The forest in the south-eastern Amazon has already become a carbon source. This is not just because of emissions from forest fires or deforestation. It is because tree mortality is increasing tremendously. If the Amazon hits a tipping point, our calculations show we are going to lose 50-70% of the forest. That would release between 200 and 250bn tonnes of carbon dioxide between 2050 and 2100, making it completely impossible to limit global warming to 1.5C.View image in fullscreenLarge areas of the Amazon have been cut down for soy plantations.Photograph: Léo Corrêa/APBrazil is one of the world’s biggest agricultural exporters. How would a tipping point affect global food security?Almost 50% of the water vapour that comes into the region from the Atlantic through trade winds is exported back out of the Amazon on what we call “flying rivers”. I was the first to calculate the huge volume of these flows: 200,000 cubic metres of water vapour per second. My former PhD student, Prof Marina Hirota, calculated that tropical forests and Indigenous territories account for more than 50% of the rainfall in the Paraná River basin in the far south of Brazil, which is a major food-growing area. These flying rivers also provide water for crops in the Cerrado, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás, Paraná, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, Paraguay, Uruguay, and all that northern Argentina agricultural area. So if we lose the Amazon, we are going to reduce the rainfall there by more than 40%. Then you can forget agricultural production at today’s levels. And that would also contribute to converting portions of the tropical savannah south of the Amazon into semi-arid vegetation.What would be the consequences for nature and human health?The devastation of the most biodiverse biome in the world would also affect hundreds of thousands of species and raise the risks of zoonotic diseases crossing the species barrier. For the first time since the Europeans came to theAmericas, we are experiencing two epidemics: Oropouche fever, and Mayaro fever. In the future, the degradation of the Amazon forest will lead to more epidemics and even pandemics.How can an Amazonian tipping point be prevented?In 2019, [the American ecologist] Tom Lovejoy and I recommended nature-based solutions, such as large-scale forestry restoration, zero deforestation, the elimination of monocultures, and a new bioeconomy based on social biodiversity. We argued that it is possible to build back a margin of safety through immediate and ambitious reforestation particularly in areas degraded by largely abandoned cattle ranches and croplands. This prompted a lot of research and new thinking.Is the Brazilian government adopting these ideas?Progress fluctuates depending on who is in power. In August 2003-July 2004, we had about 27,000 sq km of deforestation – a huge number. But the first Lula government, with Marina Silva as environment minister, brought the figure down and it reached 4,600 sq km by 2012. Later, during Bolsonaro’s government, it went up to 14,000 sq km. And now, with Lula and Marina back, it is fortunately going down again and there are several beautiful new reforestation projects. This is progress, but not enough. Now I’m saying to Marina Silva, ‘Let’s get to Cop30 with the lowest deforestation in the Amazon ever, less than 4,000 sq km.’ Who knows? But anyway, Brazil is working hard.View image in fullscreenNobre believes that more than half of the forest fires in the Amazon were began by arsonists.Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty ImagesYou have warned that criminal activity is a major new risk. Why?Last year, we had a record-breaking number of forest fires in all biomes in tropical South America – from January to November 2024, the Amazon had more than 150,000. Studies by INPE (The Brazilian Space Agency) show something very, very serious is happening. More than 98% of the forest fires were man-made. They were not lightning strikes. This is very worrying. Because even when we are reducing deforestation, organised crime is making it worse. In my opinion, more than 50% of forest fires were arson.All Amazonian countries are trying to reduce deforestation. That is wonderful, but then what to do to combat organised crime? They control a $280bn business – drug trafficking, wildlife trafficking, people trafficking, illegal logging, illegal gold mining, illegal land grabbing. It is all connected. And these gangs are at war with the governments. That’s one of the main reasons I’m becoming concerned because I know reducing deforestation is doable, so is forestry restoration. But how to combat organised crime?How have your feelings about this problem changed?I am worried that we are not acting with sufficient urgency. Thirty-five years ago, I thought we had plenty of time to get to zero deforestation and to combat the climate problem. Back then, deforestation was 7% and global warming was a little bit above 0.5C. I was not pessimistic because I felt we could find solutions. At the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, many people were saying that the world should aim for zero emissions by the year 2000. Unfortunately, nobody moved. Emissions continued to rise and they hit another record high last year. We now face a climate emergency. I am very, very concerned.Tipping points: on the edge? – a series on our futureView image in fullscreenComposite: Getty / Guardian DesignTipping points – in the Amazon, Antarctic, coral reefs and more – could cause fundamental parts of the Earth system to change dramatically, irreversibly and with devastating effects.

But there, a team of entrepreneurs is tinkering with a modest looking steel container that could hold a solution to one of the world’s dirtiest industries.Inside it are thousands of cherry-sized pellets made from quicklime. At one end, a diesel generator pipes fumes through the lime, which soaks up the carbon, triggering a chemical reaction that transforms it into limestone.With thisinvention, Seabound, the company behind it, hopes to capture large amounts of carbon directly from the decks of cargo ships, and help clean up this strikingly polluting industry. More than 50,000 cargo ships are at sea at any moment,producing 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions–more than aviation.View image in fullscreenSeabound co-founders are chief executive Alisha Fredriksson (left) and chief technology officer Rojia Wen.Photograph: SeaboundBehind all this is Alisha Fredriksson, a young entrepreneur who once dreamed of being a doctor but reached a turning point in her career after reading a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that detailed the global implications of 1.5C (2.7F)v 2C (3.6F) of warming.“That’s when I realised that everyone around the world will be affected by the climate crisis, and so if I cared about large-scale social impact, the best thing I could do would be to help tackle it,” says 30-year-old Fredriksson, chief executive of Seabound. “Then the question became ‘well, how?’”Trials have shown that her invention can scrub most of the carbon from the ship exhaust, filtered through its lime-pebbled interior. Ultimately, the goal is to have this device strapped to ships across the world’s oceans, she says.It all happened really quickly. Suddenly we had money and we had to build it … people were ready for a solutionAlisha Fredriksson, Seabound CEOAfter identifying the problem she wanted to solve, the real work began. She and her co-founder, Roujia Wen, hit on the idea of scaling down the existing quicklime-based carbon-capture technology typically employed at industrial plants.They then made a prototype, and attracted about $4m (£3m) in funding from investors. Some of this came from shipping companies.“It all happened really quickly. Suddenly we had money, and we had to go build it,” says Fredriksson. “I think people were ready for a solution.”Since then, successive prototypes of the Seabound container have taken her from the company’s test-bed in east London, to Turkish shipyards, the deck of a 3,200-container ship, and down the Suez canal on a three-week voyage to test its efficiency. This showed that a Seabound unit can capture 78% of all the carbon from the exhaust that is pumped through it, and 90% of the sulphur, a toxic air pollutant.The latest prototype is being built to the dimensions of a standard 20ft (5.9 metre) shipping container, so that it can seamlessly slot in with cargoes on deck, Fredriksson says. The design allows the stacking of several containers like regular cargo, and enables the ship to incrementally increase carbon capture in line with its journey length and decarbonisation goals.View image in fullscreenA carbon capture unit being installed on a tankerPhotograph: SeaboundOnce in port, the limestone-filled units can be substituted for containers of fresh quicklime. This product is made by heating limestone to high temperatures in kilns, an energy-intensive process that also releases CO2 from the limestone, making production extremely carbon-intensive.Companies are trying to make quicklime using kilns heated with renewable energy, or developing methods to capture the released CO2 so that it doesn’t enter the atmosphere. Seabound is working to source this “green” quicklime, Fredriksson says. “There isn’t currently a large quantity of green lime available globally, however there are many companies in the lime industry that are working on producing this – both large incumbents and various startups.”Some critics are concerned that decarbonising technologies could distract from solutions, such as zero-emission ammonia fuel or wind-powered innovations, that are essential to push the shipping industry to net zero.“The potential for short-term use of carbon-capture retrofits on existing vessels should not become a justification to extend the lifespan of fossil fuels or delay the shift to truly sustainable alternatives,” says Blánaid Sheeran, climate diplomacy policy officer atOpportunity Green, a nonprofit organisation focused on gaps in global climate policy.But Fredriksson believes Seabound’s technology could support this transition. In April, at a meeting of the International Maritime Organization,UN member states agreed to a landmark dealthat will start charging ships for every ton of emissions above a threshold. That threshold will gradually decrease to push the industry towards green fuels.View image in fullscreenThousands of cherry-sized quicklime pellets soak up 78% of the carbon and 90% of the sulphur in exhaust fumes pumped through them.Photograph: SeaboundSeabound slots into this new regulatory landscape, according to Fredriksson, by enabling ships to decarbonise their fuels, thereby lowering their emissions, and gradually adjust to the rules by adding more containers over time.Can you take a clean cruise holiday and which vessels are the worst emitters?Read more“We can grow the amount of carbon capture as the regulations ramp up,” she says, noting that the invention can start cleaning up ships now as green fuels filter through the industry.Like most startups, Seabound faces the challenges of scaling up.But with each unit priced in the tens of thousands of pounds, Fredriksson says their offering is cost-effective.and she has already has a commitment from one company to fit the first full-scale containers on to its ships this year.Her vision for the future is clear: “It would be that we’re on hundreds to, hopefully, thousands of ships, and we’ve got hubs in all the major ports around the world,” she says.This article was amended on 26 June 2025 to add some further context on quicklime’s carbon footprint, and quotes from Alisha Fredriksson addressing this issue that were originally omitted from the published article.Explore more on these topicsShipping emissionsSeascape: the state of our oceansCarbon capture and storage (CCS)Greenhouse gas emissionsShipping industryFossil fuelsClimate crisisTechnology startupsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nationwide hilarity ensued when the public voted Boaty McBoatface as the top choice for the ship’s name. However, the name was not chosen by the government, who opted to name it the Sir David Attenborough instead.Hundreds of people have submitted ideas to the Met Office. While some have named specific oil and gas companies, others have suggested names such as “bigoil” and “fossily mcfuelface”.Alexis Eyre, who works in sustainable marketing, has been drumming up support for the campaign. She said it was inspired by a letter to the Guardian last year by a reader, John Uden,who suggested:“Instead of naming storms after ‘those who work to keep people safe in times of severe weather’, thereby making these severe disruptions sound innocuous, it would be more appropriate to use the names of fossil fuel companies and the manufacturers of SUVs.”View image in fullscreenDamage caused to a home in Stondon Massey, near Brentwood in Essex, after a 400-year-old oak tree was uprooted by Storm Eunice in 2022.Photograph: Nicholas T Ansell/PAEyre told the Guardian: “An idea like this makes it much more tangible the connection between, the companies that have helped create this damage, and actually, what the consequences are.”She said the campaign had “gone crazy”, adding: “I’ve had hundreds of reposts on LinkedIn, and it just keeps on getting picked up everywhere on WhatsApp as well. So I definitely think it will gain some traction. Everyone’s hoping it will be like a Boaty McBoatface situation.”The release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere has made the storms we experience more extreme, research from the forecaster has found. Anattribution studycited by the Met Office found that rainfall in the winter season of 2023-24 was 20% more intense due to human-caused climate change, and the amount of rainfall observed during the season was 10 times more likely.Scientists predict that while the number of storms may not increase during climate breakdown, their intensity most likely will. This is because rising global temperatures contribute to more frequent weather anomalies such as the “Spanish plume”, which is when hot air from the Iberian peninsula moves northwards into the UK, creating unstable conditions that can lead to intense summer thunderstorms with heavy downpours and lightning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Civil servants were told any such event “should not go ahead”.The government insisted it was not a ban because exceptions were made on an individual basis – and pointed to an interview given by the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, and a public event given by a military chief.It had previously been reported by the Times that military chiefs had been restricted from making speeches where media were present, but the guidance has been sent out more widely and applies to all civil servants.A senior government source defended the changes, saying: “I don’t think it should be controversial that government policy is announced and explained by ministers.”But several senior civil servants said the guidance had already had a chilling effect on engagement with the world outside Whitehall, and one blamed “control freakery from the centre”.It is understood some Treasury officials decided to pull out of an Institute for Government (IfG) event this week because of the advice, leading to it being cancelled.The IfGcriticised the guidance, with the programme director, Alex Thomas, and the director-general, Hannah White, saying: “This is an overreach and will damage the quality of government and public discourse.”They said the clearance requirements were “defensible but heavy-handed” and added: “The No 10 communications team has banned any official from speaking at events that include question and answer sessions, or where the media are expected to be in attendance, seemingly so that ministers are the only, rather than the primary, people able to represent the government in public.“The strict nature of the guidance implies a very narrow view of what it is that officials do when they engage in public, and a failure to appreciate what the consequences might be of such restrictions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A third officer was found to have committed a lesser offence of misconduct.In a statement supplied by her solicitor, the girl said afterwards: “I can’t go a single day without wanting to scream, shout, cry or just give up. I don’t know if I’m going to feel normal again, but I do know this can’t happen to anyone, ever again.”Outrage over the schoolgirl’s treatment led to protests by hundreds outside a town hall and a police station after a safeguarding review revealed details of the incident.Amid suspicions on the part of school staff that she smelled of cannabis after arriving for a mock exam, she was taken to the medical room to be strip-searched while teachers remained outside. No cannabis was ever found.The search, which was carried out without her mother being informed, involved the removal of her clothing including her underwear and her bending over. She was menstruating at the time and had told officers but they still proceeded with the search.The three officers, trainee detective constable Kristina Linge, PC Victoria Wray and PC Rafal Szmydynski, had all denied gross misconduct.Allegations of gross misconduct were found by the panel to have been proved in the case of Szmydynski – whom the panel said had taken a leading role throughout the interactions with school staff and Child Q, although he was not in the room for the search – and Linge, who was a PC at the time. Both were dismissed.The panel, chaired by the Met commander Jason Prins, also found they had failed to ensure that an appropriate adult was present during the search, failed to obtain senior officer authorisation and failed to provide the child with a copy of the search record. They also did not respect her rights as a child.Announcing the panel’s decision, Prins said that the actions of the police officers involved had done “enormous harm” to Child Q and significant harm to trust in the police, as well as being a breach of professional standards. The only appropriate outcome was dismissal without notice, he added.Wray was found to have been in a “fundamentally different position” and engaged in misconduct but her failure to challenge or question colleagues did not satisfy the threshold for gross misconduct. She received a final written warning.In a rare move, the Independent Office forPoliceConduct (IOPC) had instructed the lawyers presenting the case against the police officers and had put forward the case that race and lack of accountability were at the heart of why and how the teenager was strip-searched.However, while the panel found that the incident was “a disastrous and negative interaction” between police and a black teenager, they concluded race had not been the reason Child Q was treated so badly.The search was “disproportionate, inappropriate and unnecessary”, and it was “humiliating” for the child and made her feel “degraded”.Child Q’s mother said in a statement: “Professionals wrongly treated my daughter as an adult and as a criminal and she is a changed person as a result.“Was it because of her skin? Her hair? Why her? After waiting more than four years I have come every day to the gross misconduct hearing for answers and, although I am relieved that two of the officers were fired, I believe that the Metropolitan Police still has a huge amount of work to do if they are to win back the confidence of Black Londoners.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is, however, their job to produce reliable data and to act on what it shows, and that remains to be done.”Elliot Gold, for the IOPC, told the panel on Thursday that the consequences of the incident had been to do damage and “real harm” to the relationship between the police and black communities.He added that other harms had been caused in respect of the ability and willingness of schools to seek help from the police, and to Child Q herself, who had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.Amanda Rowe, an IOPC director, said the incident had had a “significant and long-lasting impact” on the wellbeing of Child Q, who was now a young woman.She said: “This case also led to widespread public concern, and we have heard directly from a range of community stakeholders about the impact that this incident has had on trust and confidence in policing.”On the back of its investigation, the IOPC has maderecommendationsto the Home Office to amend strip-search laws to improve child safeguarding measures, including introducing a mandatory safeguarding referral for any child subject to a search exposing intimate parts.Reacting to the panel’s findings, the Met commander Kevin Southworth said what happened to Child Q “should neverhave happened and was truly regrettable”.He said: “While the officers involved did not act correctly, we acknowledge there were organisational failings. Training to our officers around strip-search and the type of search carried out on Child Q was inadequate, and our oversight of the power was also severely lacking.“This left officers, often young in service or junior in rank, making difficult decisions in complex situations with little information, support or clear resources to help their decision-making.”Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policeSchoolsSecondary schoolsChild protectionYoung peopleRaceLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re actually going to die.” Screams are heard as the bus crashes into the river.Members of the public helped emergency workers rescue the students on the bus, who were from Barton Peveril sixth-form college in Eastleigh, Hampshire.The bus’s front windows were smashed and the driver’s cab was filled with mud, while water reached halfway up the wheel arches. Passengers were evacuated through side windows and emergency workers cut away railings to allow them to get back to the road.James West, who lives close to the scene of the crash, said: “It sounded like a bomb, that’s the best description. Bits of the bus ended up in our garden. I think he [the driver] was a bit of a hero in all honesty, because he could’ve taken out cars, houses. He could’ve taken out pedestrians.“We could hear a lot of distressed people on the bus. My wife went down the back of the garden and helped people get out.”Insp Andy Tester, of Hampshire police, praised the courage of those who helped. “There was a lot of bravery shown by many people who were first on scene, who didn’t have training to work in water and weren’t equipped,” he said. “We believe that everyone, every passenger on the bus, was a student heading to Barton Peveril college. Their families have been notified.”He added: “There’s no indication at the moment as to why the bus left the road. We have to do a thorough examination of the scene, and then there’s a complex recovery of getting the bus out of the river.”At least five ambulances were sent to the scene and air ambulances were scrambled.A spokesperson for South Central ambulance service said: “We have sent multiple units to the incident including five ambulances, two helicopters, and specialist response units.”A spokesperson for the college said: “We are aware of an incident involving the college 607 bus. College staff are working closely with the police to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all students. We ask that people do not attend the actual scene. For concerned parents, an incident centre has been established.”Richard Tyldsley, the general manager of Bluestar Bus, said: “Reports suggest the bus left the highway and came to rest in a shallow river.” He said the bus driver was injured.Scott Agass, the father of a 17-year-old who was on the bus, said: “I think they are all out. He said he was sitting there with a blanket and a monitor on his finger. He doesn’t really know what happened or what caused it. I suppose it just happened so quick. All he saw was that it crashed and gone in the river.”Explore more on these topicsHampshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The findings could open the door to new ways to help women avoid pregnancy loss.Scientists at the University of Warwick and the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS trust have discovered that in some women with a history of miscarriage, the womb lining does not react the way it should and become a supportive place for an embryo to implant.This represented “a key piece of the miscarriage puzzle”, they said, tracing miscarriage risk back to a problem with the womb lining before pregnancy, which may also help explain why some women experience repeated pregnancy loss even with healthy embryos.Using the findings from the study, the team developed a diagnostic test that can measure signs of a healthy or defective reaction in the womb lining.The lead author of the study, Dr Joanne Muter, a researcher at Warwick medical school whose work was funded by the baby loss charityTommy’s, said: “This is about identifying preventable miscarriages. Many women are told they’ve just had ‘bad luck’, but our findings show that the womb itself may be setting the stage for pregnancy loss, even before conception takes place.”The team analysed about 1,500 biopsies from more than 1,300 women. They found that an essential biological process called the decidual reaction, which prepares the womb lining for pregnancy, often does not work properly in women with a history of miscarriage.When it does not fully activate, an unstable environment is created that, while still allowing embryos to implant, increases the risk of bleeding and early pregnancy loss, the researchers found.Crucially, this was not random. The abnormal response in the womb lining recurs across menstrual cycles for some women at a rate far greater than chance would predict. This suggested a consistent, measurable and potentially preventable cause of miscarriage risk, the researchers said.On the back of the research, the team developed a diagnostic test to measure the molecular signals of a healthy or dysfunctional decidual reaction. The test was piloted in Coventry, England, and has already supported the care of more than 1,000 patients.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After treatment, she and her husband, Chris, had two healthy children, George, now three years old, and 17-month-old Heidi.“Being given the opportunity to take part in this trial was lifechanging. For the first time the results of my biopsy were normal, and we went on to have not one, but two successful pregnancies,” Milikouris said.Dr Jyotsna Vohra, the director of research at Tommy’s, said women experiencing the trauma and devastation of recurrent miscarriage were far too often “left without answers”. The test could, she said, “pave the way not only for an explanation in some cases but more importantly for treatments that could prevent future pregnancy losses”.Explore more on these topicsMedical researchMiscarriageHealthWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The spokesperson for Gaza’s civil defence agency, Mahmud Bassal, said Israeli forces had killed 56 people on Thursday, including six who were waiting for food in two separate locations.There was no independent confirmation of the claim, but medical records of field hospitals run by the International Committee of the Red Cross and other NGOs seen by the Guardian detail hundreds of injuries from bullets among civilians seeking aid in the last two weeks. Witnesses have also described lethal fire from Israeli troops.Members of British Jewish body suspended after criticising Israel to launch appealRead moreThe Israeli military said soldiers had “fired warning shots” in order to prevent “suspects from approaching them” near the Netzarim corridor in central Gaza, where Palestinians gather each night, often in the hope of stopping trucks.Food has become extremely scarce in Gaza since a tight blockade on all supplies was imposed by Israel throughout March and April, threatening many of the 2.3 million people who live there with a“critical risk of famine”.Since the blockade was partly lifted last month, the UN has tried to bring in aid but has faced major obstacles, including rubble-choked roads, Israeli military restrictions, continuing airstrikes and growing anarchy.Reaching the north, where the need is greatest, has been hardest but became much easier when Israel opened the Zikim crossing, allowing wheat and other basics to be transported there directly.Aid officials in the territory described Thursday’s closure of Zikim, which Israel said was necessary to stop Hamas seizing aid, was “very problematic” and would directly impact aid distribution.New food distribution points set up by a secretive US- and Israel-backed private organisation called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation are located in central and south Gaza, out of reach of most of the million people estimated to be in the north.The Israeli government ordered the closure of the northern crossing points after footage surfaced on social media showing armed men guarding a shipment of aid. Israeli rightwing rivals to Netanyahuclaimed they were Hamas, but aid workers and others in Gaza said the guards were loyal to a council of local community leaders who had organised protection for a convoy of much-needed supplies.The Higher Commission for Tribal Affairs, which represents influential clans in the territory, said the guards had been organised “solely through tribal efforts” and that no Palestinian faction – a reference to militant groups in Gaza including Hamas – was involved.“The clans came … to form a stance to prevent the aggressors and the thieves from stealing the food that belongs to our people,” said Abu Salman Al Moghani, a representative of the Commission.On Monday, 79 trucks from aid organizations and the international community containing food for children, medical supplies and medications were transferred into Gaza after undergoing thorough security inspections, Israeli authorities said. On Tuesday, the total was 71.‘These are traps set for the people’: the story of a mother shot dead searching for food in GazaRead moreThe World Health Organization said on Thursday that it had delivered its first medical shipment into Gaza since 2 March, adding however that the nine truckloads were “a drop in the ocean”.Last week the WHO said only 17 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals were minimally to partly functional, with the rest unable to function at all.Israel launched its campaign aiming to destroy Hamas after the group’s 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 251 hostage. The militants still hold 49 hostages, fewer than half of them alive.The overall death toll in Gaza in the 20-month conflicthas now reached 56,259, mostly civilians.Hopes of a third ceasefire were raised on Wednesday when the US president, Donald Trump, told reporters he believed “great progress is being made on Gaza”. But Hamas and Israeli officials have since suggested no agreement is close.Taher al-Nunu, a Hamas official, said on Wednesday that talks with mediators had “intensified” but that the group had “not yet received any new proposals” to end the war.Israeli officials said only that efforts to return the hostages were ongoing “on the battlefield and via negotiations”.Seven Israeli soldiers were killed in a single attack in southern Gaza on Tuesday, the military’s deadliest day in the territory since it broke a ceasefire with Hamas in March.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, is facing growing calls from opposition politicians, relatives of hostages in Gaza and much of the Israeli public to bring an end to the fighting.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesAidPedro SáncheznewsShareReuse this content"

Mamdani’s decisive win against the former governorAndrew Cuomocould see Adams get wider appeal in his, though much will depend on if Cuomo also runs in the November race.“I will fight for everyday New Yorkers who just want their city to darn work for them,” Adams said at a press conference on the steps of city hall, contrasting himself with Mamdani, whom he attacked as a “silver spoon” socialist.Eric Adams signs order adopting controversial definition of antisemitismRead more“It’s a choice between a candidate with a blue collar and one with a silver spoon,” he said. “I’m not interested in slogans, I’m interested in solutions. I don’t work with special interests, I work for the people.”Adams said his record as mayor stands above the noise of politics, and his record surpasses his critics. “There are some critics who spend more time attacking than achieving. They have a record of tweets, I have a record on the streets, a record of results.”Adams’ formal entry into the race comes as the city’s business community has reacted harshly to Mamdani’s nomination andpolicy proposalsthat include a freeze on rents, free bus services, city-run groceries and higher taxes on the wealthy. They may now shift their support from Cuomo to Adams.The business community is “struggling to understand the implications of Mamdani’s victory”, Kathy Wylde, CEO of Partnership for New York City, said in an interview with Semafor.Wylde acknowledged that Mamdani’s focus on affordability tapped into “the financial insecurity young people feel and their anger that the established political class has done nothing to fix it. It’s not an endorsement of socialism but rather a rejection of the status quo, which threatens to bring on the kind of political instability that business hates.”Adams’ reputation took a beating when he was indicted on federal corruption charges – charges that were later dropped in an apparent deal with the incoming Trump administration. Since Trump returned to the White House, Adams has developed an ever closer political relationship with the US president – dismaying many Democrats.Adams met with Wall Street business leaders on Wednesday, including Daniel Loeb, a hedge fund manager, who are considering throwing their weight behind him to try to stall Mamdani, whom Adams called a “snake-oil salesman”.The support of Wall Street, which was previously backing Cuomo, suggests an alliance between Adams’ base of Black and Jewish voters against Mamdani’s young and wealthy white Brooklyn-based supporters.Loeb posted to social media, “It’s officially hot commie summer,” after Mamdani’s Tuesday night Democrat party primary win.In any second term, Adams promised to continue to bring down crime, launch a citywide mental health initiative, advance vocational training and expand affordable housing. He promised that the campaign “is going to be the most interesting political campaign in the history of the city”.Explore more on these topicsEric AdamsZohran MamdaniAndrew CuomoNew YorkUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their lawsuit, filed inNew Yorkfederal court on Tuesday, is one of several high-stakes cases brought by authors, news outlets and other copyright holders against tech companies including Meta Platforms, Anthropic and Microsoft-backed OpenAI over alleged misuse of their material in AI training.The authors requested a court order blocking Microsoft’s infringement and statutory damages of up to $150,000 for each work thatMicrosoftallegedly misused.Meta wins AI copyright lawsuit as US judge rules against authorsRead moreGenerative artificial intelligence products like Megatron produce text, music, images and videos in response to users’ prompts. To create these models, software engineers amass enormous databases of media to program the AI to produce similar output.The writers alleged in the complaint that Microsoft used a collection of nearly 200,000 pirated books to train Megatron, an AI product that gives text responses to user prompts. The complaint said Microsoft used the pirated dataset to create a “computer model that is not only built on the work of thousands of creators and authors, but also built to generate a wide range of expression that mimics the syntax, voice, and themes of the copyrighted works on which it was trained”.Spokespeople for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. An attorney for the authors declined to comment.The complaint against Microsoft came a day after a California federal judge ruled that Anthropic made fair use under US copyright law of authors’ material to train its AI systems but may still be liable for pirating their books. It was the first US decision on the legality of using copyrighted materials without permission for generative AI training. The day the complaint against Microsoft was filed, a California judge ruled in favor ofMetain a similar dispute over the use of copyrighted books used to train its AI models, though he attributed his ruling more to the plaintiffs’ poor arguments than the strength of the tech giant’s defense.‘Impossible’ to create AI tools like ChatGPT without copyrighted material, OpenAI saysRead moreThe legal fight over copyright and AI began soon after the debut of ChatGPT and encompasses several different types of media. The New York Times has sued OpenAI for copyright infringement on its archive of articles; Dow Jones, parent company of theWall Street Journaland the New York Post, has filed a similar suit against Perplexity AI. Major record labels have sued companies making AI-powered music generators. Photography company Getty Images has filed suit against Stability AI over the startup’s text-to-image product. Just last week, Disney and NBC Universal sued Midjourney, which offers a popular AI image generator, for alleged misuse of some of the world’s most famous movie and TV characters.Tech companies have argued that they make fair use of copyrighted material to create new, transformative content, and that being forced to pay copyright holders for their work could hamstring the burgeoning AI industry.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said that the creation of ChatGPT would have been “impossible” without the use of copyrighted works.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertyNew YorkChatGPTSam AltmanOpenAInewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, he found himself at the helm of one of Hollywood’s biggest franchises at its most critical junctureThu 26 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 12.52 EDTShareLike an ancient warhorse hearing the bugle for one last time, readers of a certain age will be snorting and whinnying at the words “Gareth” and “Edwards”. They are irresistible madeleines for the legends of Welsh rugby: unfeasible 70s sideburns, neck-high tackles and JPR Williams on the overlap.These days, though, things are different:Gareth Edwardsis also the name of the unassuming, Midlands-born fortysomething film director sitting in front of me, who has quietly acquired a reputation as one of Britain’s most accomplished franchise movie-makers. “I’ve had it my whole life, to be honest,” he says. “My dad was a massive rugby fan. My comedy goal is thattheGareth Edwards does something and everybody goes: ‘Oh, the film‑maker?’ That would be it. I could die happy after that.”While there is no immediate prospect of this Gareth Edwards finishing off aneight-man move and going over in the corner– any more than there is of Willie John MacBride taking on the next Iron Man movie – you sense that the tide may eventually turn in the younger man’s favour. With a Star Wars and a Godzilla movie under his belt, not to mention the Christopher-Nolan-esque sci-fi parableThe Creator, Edwards is now perched atop the new Jurassic World movie – the seventh in the series, if you count the three Jurassic Park films – which is slightly ominously subtitled Rebirth.A scorched-earth approach … watch the trailer for Jurassic World Rebirth.As gigs go, it doesn’t get much bigger. Edwards is stewarding the franchise at a critical moment: even though the last film, Dominion, proved as commercially robustas its predecessors, it took such a critical pasting, not least fromthe Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw, that the future of the whole thing was in doubt.Diplomatically, Edwards says “they just wanted to press the reset button slightly” – although Rebirth, as its title suggests, does rather more than that. It junks the entire cast and characters of the previous three films, ditches the theme-park-gone-wrong through-line and generally adopts a scorched-earth attitude to what went before. (Devotees of the franchise will be glad to know that the series’ basic DNA – involving ferocious dinosaurs and creepy corporate types attempting to exploit them – remains unchanged.) Edwards says a new beginning was very much the plan. “The honest truth is that, when the script arrived, it didn’t have the wordsJurassic Worldon the front. It really felt like a new chapter.”Even so, anyone who reads the movie-industry trade press will know that Edwards wasn’t the first name on the team sheet; what is more, theHollywood Reporter rather ungallantly described him ungallantlyas “more shooter than auteur”. Edwards, though, brushes this sort of thing aside with aplomb and readily offers an insight into how the Hollywood hiring game works. He says he found out the Jurassic producers were looking for a new director after spotting an article in the very same movie-industry trade press and messaged his agent (“is it worth throwing my hat in to see if they’d be interested?”) just as the franchise’s producer Frank Marshall was tentatively reaching out to him.View image in fullscreenCreature feature … Whitney Able in Monsters, Edwards’ directorial debut.Photograph: Vertigo Films/AllstarHe had a weekend to read the script – “I basically spent that weekend hoping I would hate it, because I kind of wanted to have a break and not do a big franchise movie” – and then found himself pitching to Marshall, a Hollywood legend who has worked on movies including Raiders of the Lost Ark, Poltergeist, The Sixth Sense and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. “I just went through my little list and waited for him to have an allergic reaction. And then, right at the end, he went: ‘OK, do you mind repeating everything you just said to me tomorrow to Steven?’ And I thought: oh shit, I assume he means Spielberg. Maybe there’s three Stevens.“So the next day I am pitching a Jurassic film to Steven Spielberg, which is very surreal. Halfway through, he asked for a pen and paper and started writing stuff down. And I thought: oh, is this a bad sign or a good sign? Then, at one point, he just stopped and smiled and went: ‘That’s great.’ And I felt like: OK, can we just end my life now? Because it can only go downhill from here.’”It’s a great pitch-meeting story, perhaps matched only by the one in which he gets a talking-to from another Hollywood big shot, Thomas Tull, just before the pair went in to Warner Bros to sell Godzilla in the early 2010s. “I felt like my whole life was hanging on what I said over the next half an hour. As we were walking there, he said: ‘Remember, Gareth, you are not auditioning for them, they are auditioning for you. If they don’t want you to do this movie, we’re going somewhere else.’ Whether he meant it or not, it was the best thing he could have said to me.”View image in fullscreen‘The studio wouldn’t leave anything to chance’ … Felicity Jones in Edwards’ 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.Photograph: Jonathan Olley/Lucasfilm/AllstarQuite how Edwards got here seems to baffle even Edwards himself. He is still awestruck by the fact he is rubbing shoulders with his childhood movie heroes – Spielberg, George Lucas – but is focused and tough enough to channel it into his own creative inspiration: “They managed to make what I consider to be art and commerciality at the same time. They managed to combine [the two to create] the holy grail. Jaws is a masterpiece and it was the most popular movie ever made when it came out. So that’s your benchmark, right? Like, what’s the matter with you, Gareth? Why can’t you try to do that?”Edwards cut his teeth in visual effects (he won a TV Bafta in 2006 fora BBC drama-documentary about Hiroshima) and applied those skills to his first feature, Monsters; released in 2010, it still looks amazing, despite being produced on an inconceivably small budget. Having established himself as the Kevin Smith of the creature feature, Edwards experienced a vertiginous ascent after being picked by Tull to oversee Hollywood’s latest attempt to take on Godzilla, going from Monsters’ $500,000 budget to a $160m blockbuster. “I felt I was getting crushed as I was doing it. I felt like: I don’t know if I’m going to survive this.”Having scrambled up the learning curve, Edwards can look back with a measure of calm. “Any movie like that is a machine, and the machine kicks in and you’ve just got to [do it]. You’ve got to know the battles you can win and the ones you can’t, the ones that are worth dying on a hill for and the ones that won’t really matter at the end of the day; they might hurt your pride a little bit, but the audience is not going to notice or care.”View image in fullscreen‘I felt I was getting crushed as I was doing it’ … Bryan Cranston(left)and Aaron Taylor-Johnson in Edwards’ 2014 film Godzilla.Photograph: Warner Bros/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe Godzilla gamble paid off handsomely and the lessons appeared to stand him in good stead: he rolled straight in to another fanboy dream project, a standalone Star Wars film. The experience of makingRogue One: A Star Wars Storywas marred by muchafter-the-event mutteringthat the scriptwriter Tony Gilroy had been brought in to re-shoot and re-edit much of the film, but Edwards remains unbowed: “It’s the nature of doing a massive film with that much pressure on it – the studio just wouldn’t leave anything to chance.” In any case, it is evident that the kerfuffle did not have any long-term effect on his standing.Edwards clearly has a talent for what Hollywood likes to call “vision”: an ability to orchestrate grand, sweeping visuals into which spectacular digital visual effects are seamlessly integrated. Rather more unusually, he also likes a roving quasi-documentary camera, giving many sequences a combat-movie edge. He also has a predilection for a certain type of scene, which you will notice if you watch all his films in a row: people dying horribly trapped behind a sealed glass door, often with someone they love watching it happen. (“Maybe I got trapped as a kid in one of those automatic doors in Sainsbury’s, or something, and my mum left and I couldn’t get out.”)That was then; this is now. Like most of Hollywood, Edwards is waiting hopefully on Rebirth’s box office performance, as movie theatres cautiously haul themselves away from the Covid disaster and try to beat back the menace of high-end TV. On the surface, at least, he seems sublimely unbothered by it all. “This movie is kind of what I’ve been waiting for. I felt that if we get the right cast, then really it’s a playground for me to do the things I love doing, you know? So I was like: it’s mine to screw up.”Jurassic World Rebirth is in cinemas in the UK, Ireland and the US from 2 July and in Australia from 3 JulyExplore more on these topicsFilmJurassic ParkJurassic WorldJurassic World: Fallen KingdomGareth EdwardsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The relationship has netted Stone an Oscar nomination and a win.Bugonia is a remake of the 2003 sci-fi comedy Save the Green Planet! from South Korean director Jang Joon-hwan. It tells the story of two conspiracy-obsessed men who kidnap the high-powered CEO of a corporation convinced she is a dangerous alien. Stone is joined by her Kinds of Kindness co-starJesse Plemonswhile Alicia Silverstone and comedian Stavros Halkias also appear.The film is also produced by Hereditary and Midsommar director Ari Aster, who recently directed Stone in the Covid-set comedy westernEddington, which premiered to mixed reviews at this year’s Cannes film festival.The screenplay comes from Will Tracy, who has worked on Succession and also written the script for comedy thriller The Menu. He created 2024’s HBO series The Regime, a satire starring Kate Winslet that received mostly negative reviews.Lanthimos spoke about the movie in ainterviewwith The Playlist last year:Well, actually just this one is one of the few times that I read a script that I hadn’t generated or I hadn’t been developing for a long time, and I was immediately drawn to it. And then I did a little bit of work with the writer Will Tracy in order to make it a little bit more my own. It’s just one of these things that something clicks in the story, in the tone. Again, something you probably haven’t done before, working with the same actors, like working with Emma again and Jesse, it’s just exciting to get into it, do something different, but also with that kind of familiarity.Lanthimos is also attached to an adaptation of Ottessa Moshfegh’s My Year of Rest and Relaxation and an adaptation of Jean-Patrick Manchette’s assassin thriller Fatale.Stone is set for an untitled romantic comedy directed by her husband, Dave McCary, while Plemons, who was recently seen in Netflix’s thriller series Zero Day, will appear alongside Tom Cruise in Alejandro González Iñárritu’s untitled new comedy.Bugonia has been tipped to premiere at this year’s Venice film festival given that Lanthimos has premiered a number of his movies there before.

But maybe the Spaceballs-like distinction is necessary, given the existence of F1 the Album, a soundtrack nearly as starry as the movie it accompanies. Maybe starrier: Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem, Kerry Condon and Shea Whigham probably can’t overpower the combination of Don Toliver, Doja Cat, Tate McRae, Ed Sheeran, Rosé, Dom Dolla and Chris Stapleton. This isn’t the only recent compilation to bring back the very early-to-mid-2000s moniker of “the Album”; Twisters: the Album, a 29-track country compilation, reached the Billboard top 10 in the US last summer. Rihanna, a massive pop star who hasn’t released an album in almost a decade, put out her first new song in ages on a little record calledSmurfsMovie Soundtrack (Music From & Inspired By). (She plays Smurfette in the new cartoon.) Soundtracks, those mainstays of mall CD stores, are back – in streaming and vinyl form.For decades, the idea of pop music soundtrack albums needing a comeback would have been deeply strange; they’ve been a presence more or less since the late 1960s new Hollywood inflection point of The Graduate, with its foregrounded Simon & Garfunkel hits and written-for-the-film Mrs Robinson. But by the late 2000s, soundtrack albums were perfectly engineered to go down with the music industry ship. For much of the 1990s, the industry did their best to steer music buyers away from cheap, easily attainable singles by often holding them from standalone release and forcing the purchase of a $19 CD for anyone who wanted a copy of a hit song. Soundtracks offered further scarcity, imprisoning non-album tracks that might have once served as B-sides on cheap 7in singles. Hardcore fans might be willing to fork over their money for a particularly good or rare one, getting exposure to some like-minded artists in the bargain. Popular ones could even inspire their own sequels.From legal issues to reshoots: is the Michael Jackson biopic cursed?Read moreThat said, the bestselling soundtracks ever have tended to be driven by a single artist; Whitney Houston and the Bee Gees may not perform every song on the respective soundtracks for The Bodyguard and Saturday Night Fever, but they’re as closely identified with those records as Prince is with his Purple Rain. But there were plenty of commercially successful (and in the cases of films such as Trainspotting or Pulp Fiction, thoroughly well-curated) soundtracks that took a more varied approach. At best, they recreated the movie’s whole vibe. At worst, they felt like a mall rat swindle.By the Wind-up Records years, when early superhero movies were often accompanied by compilations of the worst the nu-metal-influenced alt-rock world had to offer (welcome to the used bins, Daredevil: the Album), that compilation approach had lost its charm. Generations of music fans had grown accustomed to downloading, whether illegal or through Apple. While some labels did attempt the old withholding move, making certain single tracks only available with a full-album purchase, it didn’t do much good in a post-Napster world. Even as CD prices dropped, the utility of paying $12 or $15 for a bunch of leftovers with the vaguest of theming to a bad Fantastic Four movie somehow lost its appeal. In the 2010s, streaming made the whole album format obsolete for some listeners.And for some, it still is. So how the hell did soundtrack albums, of all things, mount a comeback? Some of it has to do with the resurgence of vinyl, and the increased cachet of physical media as a collector’s object more than a practical method of consuming music. Boutique labels have released limited-edition colored vinyl of countless previously obscure movie scores, so it was only a matter of time before that proceeded to cover more mainstream-friendly pop soundtrack albums – in turn incentivizing labels and studios to get together on new versions, not just endless reissues. (No offense, Clueless Original Motion Picture Soundtrack limited edition hot pink LP.) As any touring artist can tell you, there’s a lot of money in merch, and not every movie lends itself well to collectible action figures or A24-style knick-knacks.Labels have also found new ways to game a new system, little consolation prizes in the post-apocalyptic music landscape. It’s not just generosity of spirit that leads to F1 the Album sporting 17 tracks, or Twisters corralling a whopping 29. Albums with more songs have a chart advantage in the streaming world; it’s why Drake records routinely sprawl past the 20-track mark, and one edition of Taylor Swift’s last release crested 30. (At the same time, plenty of Disney musicals have reinstated the practice of separating songs from score; the regular edition of the Mufasa soundtrack has a whopping seven tracks, with the film’s score available either as a separate album or part of a “deluxe edition”.) A big, fat sampler of superstar collaborations can also make a movie like F1 feel like a throwback event – a studio’s way of signaling: “Look, this is a real movie, like you used to see. We mean it this time.” Some of these new-fangled soundtracks are able to conjure the actual mood of the movie in question – though if 29 different pop songs really play during Twisters, they fly past with all the impact of a fuzzy radio dial. But maybe super-sized lengths or special-edition packages can serve as easy substitute for those hard-to-recapture vibes.And sometimes a soundtrack really is instrumental to a movie’s vibes, after all. Ryan Coogler’s recent smash hitSinnershas almost as many songs as a proper musical, and its sprawling soundtrack captures both the blues sound that backdrops its characters’ attempt to carve out a juke joint of their own in 1930s America, and the Irish folk tunes wielded menacingly by a group of vampires. The film itself has a very soundtracky sensibility; one of its centerpiece scenes uses the blues as a gateway for a time-bending trip through folk and popular music throughout the ages, transcending the film’s 1930s setting. It’s a rare case of a soundtrack that works both ways: viewers of the movie can re-immerse themselves in those gorgeous musical sequences with the album, and anyone looking for a preview of the movie’s overall time-warped feel (if not necessarily its full visceral power) can check out the songs on Spotify.Not all soundtracks can perform that kind of magic. Will F1 the Album sell a single ticket to see Brad Pitt get his very own Top Gun: Maverick? Probably not; as far as we know, Doja Cat andTate McRaethemselves do not join the racing team. It’s entirely possible, though, that it will out-chart any number of buzzy or legacy single-artist albums – and so will that Smurfs album by virtue of boasting that exclusive Rihanna track, just like in the old days. If records can’t be fully rescued by colored vinyl and stan loyalty, well, they can sure as hell be further branded on the way down.Explore more on these topicsFilmRihannaTate McRaeSinnersPop and rockBrad PittfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as well as being an academic and conductor, Bantock was a prolific composer, with a work list including four symphonies, five concertos and nine operas, of which the last, the “Celtic folk opera” The Seal Woman, is easily the best remembered now.View image in fullscreenThe premiere of The Seal Woman in 1924 was the Birmingham Repertory theatre’s first production; librettist Marjory Kennedy-Fraser took the main role of the Cailleach, whose dreams and visions tell the story of the Selkie, seal-people who emerge from the sea every seven years to live on land, shedding their skins to take human form.Kennedy-Fraser’s text is a patchwork of 24 folk songs that she collected in the Western Isles, and originally she intended it as a spoken drama. Even in the operatic version, the songs remain central; Bantock’s music, for an instrumental ensemble of 16 players, tactfully wraps itself around the original melodies, never dominating, and preserving as much of the integrity of Kennedy-Fraser’s accompaniments as possible.Dramatically, though, it remains inert. Although the original melodies and some of the texts as Kennedy-Fraser presents them have their own intrinsic beauty, The Seal Woman comes across as rather faded, dated and uninvolving. That’s despite the best efforts of conductor John Andrews and a carefully assembled cast of singers, led by Yvonne Howard as the storytelling Cailleach and mezzo Catherine Carby as the Seal Woman herself. But it’s the curiosity value of the score that recommends it above all.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Now she adds a disc of more sonatas by arguably the most important baroque composer for the violin after JS Bach – five of the collection of eight that Biber published in 1681, as well as the quasi-theatrical Sonata Representivo, which may or may not have been composed by Biber and probably dates from 1669.The pieces are all characterised by their extreme technical difficulty, and especially by their extensive use of scordatura, when individual violin strings are tuned differently from usual. Podger copes with all these challenges quite brilliantly, including imitating the sounds of animals in the Sonata Representivo; she brings an expressive freedom that never takes too many liberties, but remains true to the spirit of the music. If the works themselves are not quite as startling and vivid as the Rosary Sonatas, anyone who enjoyed Podger’s previous encounter with Biber will surely relish this one, too.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Blending romance, pulpy sci-fi and family drama, it opens with octogenarian Iris Chase Griffen recalling the moment she was told her sister, Laura, had driven off a bridge. The police inform her that two people witnessed Laura deliberately swerve off the road. Though Iris believes this to be true, she insists to the officers that it was an accident.We go on to hear about Iris’s privileged upbringing and marriage of convenience to Richard Griffen, the wealthy owner of a button factory, and her estrangement from her granddaughter with whom she hopes to reconcile. The book also contains excerpts from Laura’s posthumously published novel which features clandestine romantic encounters between an unnamed man – seemingly a fugitive – and a wealthy woman. During their trysts, they concoct a wild fable about life on a distant planet. All this is interspersed with newspaper items reporting on the lives of the Chases and Griffins over 60 years.This is one of a series of new audio recordings of Atwood novels made exclusively with Canadian actors; others include Alias Grace, Cat’s Eye, The Robber Bride and the Oryx and Crake trilogy. The Blind Assassin comes with three narrators: Emma Love reads the novel-within-a-novel; David Attar delivers the newspaper reports; and Jennifer Higgin is the inscrutable, complex Iris whose actions are a puzzle to be decoded. “You want the truth of course,” she says, addressing the listener. “You want me to put two and two together. But two and two doesn’t necessarily get you the truth.”Available via Little, Brown Audio, 23hr 2minFurther listeningWhen the GoingWas GoodGraydon Carter, WF Howes, 12hr 29minThe former Vanity Fair editor documents his star-studded career in magazine publishing.

Bernadeta is dying in an annoying way, with “deep, raspy snores”. Margarida herself has been dead for some time. Rather than ascend to heaven, she has been “dragged downstairs by the ghastly, insufferable women of the house”. Irene Solà’s teeming third novel, I Gave You Eyes and You Looked Toward Darkness, follows these women, both dead and alive, as they prepare for a party. They cook and scrub, tell stories and make fart jokes. The novel begins at dawn and ends at night, but the historical era jumps around without warning. Now the viceroy’s men are arriving on horseback. Now a teenager is calling everyone a “dumbass”. Now local women are fleeing from Nazi soldiers. Characters shape-shift as much as the timeline. A he-goat becomes a bull, then a cat, then “an unusually long, skinny man with the toes of a rooster”. Now the viceroy’s men are demons, dragging Margarida into a “sea of blood”.I Gave You Eyes and You Looked Toward Darkness references Mrs Dalloway, and shares the modernist interest in formal experimentation and action that unfolds over a single day. Instead of tracking interior sensation, Solà presents a seemingly inexhaustible slew of bodily description, held together by the opaque, vindictive logic of a folk tale. There are wonderful lists: of the different kinds of shit on the mountain, of cheese-making equipment, of body parts fondled by hands in the dark. I read the book twice in quick succession and every time I opened it, I found something to savour. The prose has the demonic excess of a Hieronymus Bosch painting.Here is a list of key descriptions of central characters, as translated from Catalan by Mara Faye Lethem. Bernadeta, who was born without eyelashes, is “ugly”. Joana, the woman from whose “entrails” Margarida was “ripped”, is also “ugly”. Bernadi, Margarida’s father, is “ugly as a wart”. Her sister Blanca is a “deviant” with no tongue. Marta (“ugly”) spends her youth looking out of the window trying to catch “the curled shape of an ugly man in a storm”. As an infant, Marti was “ugly as a scowl”. Even unborn frogs are imagined as “ugly”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

A long time ago, Joana met a bull so black that even “the flesh inside his eyes was black”. She gave the creature her soul in exchange for a “full man”. But then Joana claimed she’d been wronged. Her new husband, the heir of Mas Clavell, was missing a toe and therefore not “full”. The devil returned as an “ugly, haggard, bald man” and doomed Joana’s descendants to be born with something missing. For two of them – one missing a liver and one an anus – this is fatal. For the novel, the curse is a vibe killer. Anything can happen in its world, and yet what does happen is strangely predictable: more, different suffering. The characters, without agency, don’t develop. Rather, they are punished.Perhaps there is more to the novel’s apparent scorn for its characters’ rural damnation. Perhaps it wants to show that the natural world’s capricious, disruptive energy gives the lie to human fatalism. Solà’s serious attention to the nonhuman makes most contemporary realist literary fiction feel narrow and timid, wilfully deaf to the other forms of life with which all human drama is interdependent. Her second novel,When I Sing, Mountains Dance, is a tender human love story that turns on moments where human and nonhuman come into contact. A roe-buck, a field of chanterelle mushrooms, tectonic plates: all meaningfully participate in the development of an elegant plot. I Gave You Eyes and You Looked Toward Darkness compares all its humans to animals: Blanca has a “bovine” face, Joana’s is like a mare. Sometimes, the connection is illuminating. But more often, the emphasis on urges and ugliness reduces and simplifies both human and animal, rather than opening them out to one another’s complexity. Bernadeta scrapes “toast with her front teeth, like a rabbit”. Margarida turns her head away, “repulsed”.I Gave You Eyes and You Looked Toward Darkness by Irene Solà, translated by Mara Faye Lethem, is published by Granta (£14.99).

Everything changed. Old-school deference was dead; the proletariat was in power.The communist American journalist John Reed witnessed a contretemps that captured the suddenness of the change. In simpler times, sailors would have yielded to senior ministers, but on the day of thestorming of the Winter Palace in St Petersburg, they weren’t having it. When, in a last-ditch effort to save the Provisional Government, two liberal grandees demanded that they be let in, one of the sailors replied, “We will spank you! And if necessary we will shoot you too. Go home now, and leave us in peace!”Here was an anecdote confirming Trotsky’s lofty pronouncement that the revolution marked the “forcible entrance of the masses into the realm of rulership”. Where Trotsky was coolly detached in his bird’s-eye The History of the Russian Revolution, Reed was breathless in his wide-eyed, worm’s-eye memoir, Ten Days that Shook the World.Reed had the zeal of the convert. Born into a pig-iron fortune in Oregon, he rebelled against his preppy upbringing by embracing the bohemia of Greenwich Village: “delicatessens, bookshops, art studios and saloons, its long-haired men and short-haired women.” Thereafter, he was fired up by the silk weavers’ strike in New Jersey in 1913. Four years later, a sense of adventure and afolie à deuxwith his socialist wife Louise Bryant took them to Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd), where they witnessed the revolution’s great set pieces first-hand.Warren Beatty’s portrayal of him as a true believerin the biopic Reds, leafleting and dodging bullets, got him down to a tee. So it was hardly surprising that he was faced with sedition charges on his return. He was indicted for violating the Espionage Act for inveighing against American entry into the First World War. Hounded out of his homeland, he fled to Russia and died of typhus, aged 32; no medicines were available on account of the Western blockade of the Russian Civil War.Reed’s is one of six lives served up by historian Simon Hall in his new book. Three of them are revolutionaries – Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro – and three are American journalists who filed stories from the frontlines of the Russian, Chinese, and Cuban revolutions, respectively: Reed, Edgar Snow and Herbert Matthews. These are unexpected pairings, chosen, one presumes, for their convenience in enabling Hall to reconstruct his three very foreign societies with the help of a largely monoglot bibliography.Hall’s trot through three coups is less interesting than the three scoops, described with rich period and cultural detailThe conceit is to chronicle the journeys that represented turning points in 20th-century history. In Lenin’s case, it was his return to Russia from Swiss exile in April 1917. Something of a party pooper, he maintained that the February Revolution that overthrew the tsar wasn’t the real deal. In good time, his comrades came around, and that’s how we got the Russian Revolution.In China, meanwhile, the Long March of 1934-5 was a desperate retreat. It was also a lesson in geography and endurance. On the run from the nationalist Kuomintang party’s Chiang Kai-shek, who was working with Hitler’s general Hans von Seeckt, some 90,000 troops and persecuted communists made the 9,000km trek from the Jiangxi Soviet in the south to Yan’an in the north. Only about 6,000 survived, and Mao emerged as their leader.For his part, Castro returned to Cuba from Mexico in 1956 aboard the Granma, “a creaking, leaking leisure yacht”. As onecompañeroput it, it was not so much a landing as a shipwreck. Not all of them managed to negotiate the mangrove thickets of Playa Las Coloradas and Fulgencio Batista’s strafing planes, but Castro did. Three years later, he toppled the dictator.Hall’s tired trot through the three coups is less interesting than the three scoops he describes. Besides Reed’s, we have the midwestern ad man turned journalist Edgar Snow’s. He spent four months swimming and playing tennis with Mao’s guerrillas in Bao’an, writing up the experience gushingly in Red Star Over China. Zhou Enlai, wrote Snow, was “every inch an intellectual”, Mao a “gaunt, rather Lincolnesque figure”, and the comrades “the freest and happiest Chinese I had known”. Hall says that Red Star Over China was “no crass work of propaganda”. But it was. Snow would have known about Mao’s purges in the Jiangxi Soviet from 1931-36, in which, it was later revealed, 700,000 people perished.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Here he is on Castro, whom he met in the Sierra Maestra mountains in 1957: “This was quite a man – a powerful six-footer, olive-skinned, full-faced with a straggly beard.” What’s more, Castro was “not only not Communist but decidedly anti-Communist”. Matthews’s dispatches went a long way in swaying American opinion against Batista’s dictatorship, but needless to say, some of the more confident pronouncements about Castro’s politics aged badly.Hall’s potted narratives trundle along, absorbing rich period and cultural details. His strengths lie in storytelling, not history-writing, which is to say he is more at home with description than analysis. But there lies the rub. Unlike Reed, Snow, and Matthews, he is writing at one remove. This necessitates extensive quotation and, worse, lengthy paraphrases that are inevitably weaker than the lapidary originals.Three Revolutions: Russia, China, Cuba and the Epic Journeys that Changed the World by Simon Hall is published by Faber (£25).

The response was a surprise for the developer. The game looks interesting, people wrote in the comments, but was “ruined” by AI art. But the game’s cover art, used as the thumbnail for the YouTube video, was in fact made by a real person,according to developer Lana Ro. “We know the artist, we’ve seen her work, so such a negative reaction was unexpected for us, and at first we didn’t know how to respond or how to feel,” Ro said. “We were confused.”It’s not wrong for people to be worried about AI use in video games – in fact, it’s good to be sceptical, and ensure that the media you support aligns with your values. Common arguments against generative AI relate to environmental impact, art theft and just general quality, and video game developers are grappling with how generative AI will impact their jobs. But the unexpected problem is that the backlash against generative AI is now hurting even those whodon’tuse it. “I would rather people be overly cautious than not,” veteran game developer andChessplusdigital directorJosh Caratellisaid. “But being collateral damage does suck.”Caratelli and his game Chessplus were caught up in a similar situation when heposted some art to Reddit– sharing explicitly that it was commissioned andnotmade with AI. Even then, Caratelli said he’s received several comments and direct messages accusing him of lying about it, or suggesting he’d been duped. “It’s very clearly hand drawn,” he said. “It was a fair whack of money to spend for an indie team on a piece of art. We thought it was worth it.”View image in fullscreenDarth Vader as he appears in Epic Games' Fortnite, which recreates actor James Earl Jones’ voice using conversational AIPhotograph: Epic Games/Disney/LucasfilmIt’s becoming increasingly common for people to call out instances where a game seems to have used AI in a way that replaces human work. (Epic Games was singled outrecently for its AI Darth Vader.) But sometimes, that anger is misdirected at people and companies that are simplybelievedto be using AI.This is what happened when a Magic: The Gathering artist was accusedof using AI, forcing Wizards of the Coast to put out a statement on the false accusations. Even Nintendo was accused, in May, of using AI-generated images for in-game billboards in Mario Kart World.Nintendo put out a statementto deny the claims.Bigger companies such as Wizards of the Coast and Nintendo may be able to weather false accusations, but indie studios with less influence may have a harder time. Little Droid, released in April, stars a little robot navigating a lush pixel-art world. Its cover, on the other hand, renders the droid in a totally different style – with the smooth, glossy finish that people have come to expect from AI art generation tools. People in the YouTube comments pointed to specific details to “prove” the art is AI-generated: the robot itself is asymmetrical, because AI has issues with symmetry; the glow or lighting look off; some naysayers simply argued that real people don’t draw like that. Stamina Zero, in the comments, continued to hold its ground – that no AI was used in development of the game or its art.Then the studio posted a video it said proves it, showing several steps in the art’s process. The video showed early art concepts, navigating different layers in Adobe Photoshop as a way to demonstrate how the art came together. “We contacted the artist and asked her for all the available intermediate sketches and the source PSD with all the layers,” Ro said. “Based on all the available files, we put together a video as quickly as possible and posted it … It was a damage control move – a way to calm things down and make the discussion more productive. We had nothing to hide and were ready to be transparent.”Some people relented, accepting the video as proof that AI was not used. Others were unconvinced. There’s no actual drawing in the video, which would be impossible to share unless the artist was recording their entire process. That is something some artists do already – but it creates additional work for them. And, as Stamina Zero found out, there will always be people who still don’t believe.The trailer for Stamina Zero’s Little Droid“To be honest, I don’t have a clear strategy for how we will proceed in the future,” Ro said. “There was advice on Reddit not to make art similar to the results of AI work, as this triggers people. And this tip could work. But AI learns from the work of artists and, in the future, it is quite possible that it will be able to replicate any style.”Caratelli shares the community’s ethical concerns about AI plagiarism, environmental impact and human creativity. But he was dispirited by the accusations against Chessplus. “It’s really hard for AI to make things with meaning. It’s a thousand little intricacies that make a game great … [That] work isn’t being valued,” he said. Ro agreed: “It’s completely unfair that so many people who have honed their craft for years are facing this and being wrongfully accused.”Both of these games are examples of how generative AI has poisoned the creative well, even for creators whoaren’tusing it. We can never be totally sure, now, whether we’re looking at something that a human made or not, as even proof can theoretically be fabricated. For creatives and players, it will have to come down to a relationship of trust.Explore more on these topicsGamesArtificial intelligence (AI)PlayStationnewsShareReuse this content"

This latest show puts elegant grace to one side in favour of the raw, feral and ferocious, as the acrobatic performers are driven by animal instincts.The Lafayette at Underbelly’s Circus Hub on the Meadows, 1-23 AugustShaper/Caper: Small Town BoysWinner of the creative arts prize at last year’s Proud Scotland awards, Dundee-based company Shaper/Caper tell the story of LGBTQ+ nightlife in the 1980s and early 90s under the spectre of Aids and widespread homophobia, and the people searching for sanctuary, escapism and community on the dance floor.Zoo Southside, 1-17 AugustView image in fullscreenSex, disability and kink … Dan Daw with Christopher Owen.Photograph: Shannyn HigginsThe Dan Daw ShowA show that comes with trigger warnings and no coyness about its subject matter: sex, disability and kink. Self-described “queer crip” Dan Daw takes control of his own narrative by letting himself be dominated in this unique duet musing on power, pleasure, care and consent. These are the last performances after four years of touring.The Lyceum, 2-4 AugustBarrowland Ballet: Wee ManVery much in sync with one of 2025’s talking points, choreographer Natasha Gilmore looks at the subject of masculinity in Wee Man. Inspired by Gilmore’s own experience as a mother of teenage boys, it features a multigenerational cast exploring the shifting rules of masculinity through the ages with dynamic movement and tenderness.Assembly @ Dance Base, 5-17 AugustView image in fullscreenSurreal … Stephanie Dufresne in CoisCéim Dance Theatre’s Dancehall Blues.Photograph: Ros KavanaghCoisCéim Dance Theatre: Dancehall BluesLongstanding Dublin dance company CoisCéim returns to the fringe with director David Bolger’s latest work, Dancehall Blues, which boasts excellent reviews from its Irish premiere last year. The setup is a duet in a surreal dance hall “where dreams and nightmares collide”, with the atmospheric, movement-focused work moving between hope and dystopia.Assembly @ Dance Base, 12-24 AugustIsaiah Wilson: ScoreThree dancers are hooked up to electric muscle stimulators, which are triggered by a Midi controller backstage, with the help of Luxembourg-based experimental choreographer Isaiah Wilson. All sorts of questions about free will are thrown up in a mere 30 minutes. Is this an experiment in human-digital-algorithmic interaction, or a vision of a dystopian future where the machines have taken over?Assembly @ Dance Base, 12-24 AugustLéa Tirabasso: In the BushesA first trip to the Edinburgh fringe for award-winning French choreographer Léa Tirabasso. In the Bushes tackles the absurdity of life, in Tirabasso’s own quirky, surrealist, sometimes grotesque way. Don’t expect to know what’s going on exactly, but if you like to have room in your dance to do some intellectual/imaginative digging, this could be for you.Summerhall, 13-25 AugustView image in fullscreenPremiere … Roseanna Leney and Charlotta Öfverholm in Mary, Queen of Scots.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicScottish Ballet: Mary, Queen of ScotsThe dramatic life and rule of Scotland’s 16th-century queen, told through the prism of her relationship with cousin and rival Elizabeth I.

The surprise in the director’s production of Eugene O’Neill’s final play is that it is served up straight.Frecknall has stepped back to let the play do the speaking but this faithfulness lays bare the datedness of the drama, which creaks with age at times. The production itself seems imbalanced too: glacial in pace, it stretches across three hours, not gathering enough intensity and chugging anti-climactically to its end.Dissolute farmer Phil Hogan (David Threlfall) dreams up a scheme for his daughter, Josie (Ruth Wilson), to seduce the wealthy landlord James Tyrone (Michael Shannon) as a ploy to blackmail him and keep the farm from being sold to a neighbour. So Josie and James spend a moonlit night together, flirting, drinking, arguing and proclaiming love which may or may not be real. An hour in, it feels as if the play is simply circling its plot rather than arriving at its purpose. More than two hours later, Josie and James’s relationship reveals some vulnerability.View image in fullscreenHardscrabble … Ruth Wilson and David Threlfall.Photograph: Marc BrennerWilson is, as always, magnetic in her stage presence, in farm-hand dungarees with the hint of Irishness to her American accent, while Threlfall is convincing as the bullish, wayward father. But characters hover between the roguish, melodramatic and tragic, speaking in scheming monologues which arrest psychological development. Tom Scutt’s set design looks stagnant under a beige wash of timber, planks and ladders, the inside of the farm wall-less but without the intrigue this exposure might bring.As inLong Day’s Journey Into Night(to which this play is a sequel), illusion wrestles with truth, reality and revelation: James is a city type who drinks heavily and reveals deeper, mournful dimensions; Josie has a brazen reputation about town (the “scandal of the countryside”) but one of the mysteries of the plot lies around her sexual virtue. Her story feels oddly – jarringly – eclipsed by James’s outpouring of grief and guilt, along with his glaring madonna/whore fantasy, which shapes their dynamic.Female sexuality as a whole is defined by the men around Josie either as threat or currency with which to bargain for advantage. Josie’s breasts are casually, repeatedly, admired and women are referred to as sluts and pigs. While this may be of its world – an early 20th-century hardscrabble farm community in Connecticut – it gives the play an old-fashioned, queasy feel. The drama ends with what seems like Josie’s transformation into a would-be saviour for the suffering man that James embodies. “Mother me, Josie, I love it,” he says, and she obliges. Is O’Neill suggesting this was Josie’s moral lesson to learn?Perhaps not, but too much of the play creaks with what feel like anachronisms. Frecknall is sometimes charged with being too overbearing a director but this production might have benefited from bigger, bolder revisionism.At theAlmeida theatre, London, until 16 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlmeida theatreEugene O'NeillRebecca FrecknallRuth WilsonMichael ShannonDavid ThrelfallreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jimmy, the protagonist of the Who’s classic album – later a film, now a ballet – brims with awkwardness and scrappy bravado. His hunger for life and his desperation to be someone are viscerally felt when the fantasy of adult life rubs up against the sometimes grubby reality.Should a ballet version of the Who’s 1973 album work? Well it turns out that it does.Pete Townshendmight be the man behind the Who’s sound, but it’s his wife, composer and orchestrator Rachel Fuller, who is in large part responsible for this. She originally orchestrated the album for the Classic Quadrophenia project a decade ago, and that’s the backdrop for this show, minus vocals. The music is majestic, especially the recurring riff from Love, Reign O’er Me that does sterling dramatic work each time it appears and builds to an almighty climax as Jimmy faces crisis after the famous mods and rockers clash on Brighton beach.View image in fullscreenMoves so sharp they sting like a paper cut … Dan Baines as Ace Face, centre.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThis is not a classical ballet, but a dance piece drawing on a number of styles, choreographed by Paul Roberts and directed by Rob Ashford. Roberts is best known from the pop world (Spice Girls, Harry Styles), Ashford from musicals, and they bring a snappy pace to the storytelling, especially in the first act, the narrative based on Townshend’s original liner notes. Paris Fitzpatrick is perfectly cast as disaffected Jimmy, full of tetchy energy, and the four facets of Jimmy’s personality (the “quad” of the title) are represented by different dancers: the swooning Romantic and feral Lunatic, along with the Hypocrite and the Tough Guy, although that’s a device perhaps underused.Jimmy’s apparently uninterested parents are mired in their own troubles and the most poignant choreography comes in an early duet for the couple. Before they even dance, you can sense their dissatisfaction, reluctance and antipathy (in Kate Tydman’s Mother especially), but slowly their defences melt into a tender ballroom hold. The best dancing, however, belongs to the mods in the club scene, all jagged shoulders and jutting chins, moves so sharp they sting like a paper cut.View image in fullscreenCameo … Matthew Ball in Quadrophenia.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRoyalBalletprincipal Matthew Ball is parachuted in for a cameo as an arrogant rock star dressed in Paul Smith union jack jacket. Circling the stage with histours en l’airand pirouettes, he’s got the swagger but it’s all too clean. The following scene though, where Ball sneers at Jimmy and his friends hankering for autographs, is painfully effective. This is a story about false idols (such as king of the mods Ace Face, who turns out to be a lowly hotel bellboy) and it’s about the desperation to belong. That’s mirrored across the generations when Jimmy’s alcoholic dad remembers his wartime service, not only the tragedy but the lost sense of purpose and camaraderie.Smart decisions have been made about the minimal set (by Christopher Oram) and the excellent projections by YeastCulture that make a huge difference to the sense of realism: the condensation on a cafe window, the waves on Brighton seafront. All the pieces fall into place in an engrossing show that has style and substance, grit and grace. It looks like Quadrophenia is a hit once again.AtSadler’s Wells, London, until 13 July.

Since the 1980s, he has created more than a dozen multiyear series, tackling extractive industries like mining and oil refining in India, China and Azerbaijan, traveling to such disparate places as Western Australia, Chile’s Atacama desert and the so-called ship graveyards of Bangladesh.‘Human activity on a massive scale’: a photo exhibition tackles the climate crisisRead moreOften taken from high in the sky, his photos offer views of industrial landscapes that attend to color and pattern with a sophisticated eye reminiscent of abstract expressionism, while also forcing us to contend with the devastating transformations to the natural world required to sustain our way of life.Burtynsky’s new show at the International Center ofPhotographyin New York, titled The Great Acceleration, brings together some 70 photographs from a lifetime behind the lens. It seeks to offer a fitting survey of a masterful photographic career, and it debuts the largest photographic mural that Burtynsky has ever done.His relationship with the medium began when he was about 12, when he got his first camera. As a young child, he spent hour upon hour painting alongside his father, who had hoped to become an artist but ended up working in factories. After he learned to painstakingly sketch landscapes and paint with oils, the ease of photographs was a revelation. “I just realized how in one fraction of a second I can create a landscape – just, boom, it’s there,” Burtynsky told me. “I loved how it was a modern, fast way to get your image, and I loved the darkroom, watching the image emerge.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Charles RousselSimilarly, Burtynsky’s relationship with the industrial world that has become his subject goes back to his formative years – originally trained as a tool and die maker, he came of age working within factories, seeing first-hand just how dirty, loud and dangerous they really were. “When I saw the scale of industry, as a young 18-year-old working in these places,” Burtynsky said, “I could tell that if we were going to become this population of all this growth that they were projecting, then all of this was just going to amplify, this all was just going to get bigger and more insane.”Turning away from such a life, Burtynsky began to study the graphic arts, and after a well-timed push from one of his instructors, he made the decision to receive formal instruction in photography. After spending so much time around heavy industry, he said, it was a revelation: “All of a sudden, I’m exposed to the whole history of art, and the whole history of music, and the whole history of photography.” It was in school that Burtynsky got exposure to major influences like Eadweard Muybridge, Carleton Watkins, Caspar David Friedrich and painters of the New York school, particularly Jackson Pollock. It was there that he also began to develop his distinctive way of seeing the world.“I really liked the kind of field painting, the compression of space, the gesture, the color fields, in abstract expressionism,” he said. “So I started doing landscapes, but I said: ‘I’m not just going to go out into the forest and do cliches like anybody else. I’m going to go and try to do Jackson Pollocks with a large-format camera. I’m going to try to attune my eye so I can find really complex spaces in nature that are almost like gesture paintings.’”View image in fullscreenMines #13, Inco – Abandoned Mine Shaft, Crean Hill Mine, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, 1984.Photograph: Edward Burtynsky, courtesy Howard Greenberg Gallery, New YorkIn no small part because of that painterly eye, Burtynsky imbues his work with an undeniable beauty, a fact that has sometimes made critics uneasy. Shots like that of a enormous stepwell in Rajasthan, or the Chino mine in Silver City, New Mexico, are mesmerizing in their intricacy, their arrangement of color and the hypnotic way that Burtynsky has framed the innumerable lines within. If his photographs of environmental destruction are gorgeous, Burtynsky defends them on the ground that this pleasingness evokes the curiosity and engagement that leads to potentially fruitful dialogue.“There are all sorts of issues that start to rise up. Like: are you aestheticizing the destruction of the planet?” he said. “Well, that’s not how I’m looking at it. But maybe. I’m really trying to find a visual language that has a painterly or surreal quality to it that shows the world we’ve evolved in a way that makes people engage with it, versus saying: ‘That’s just a banal picture of something that I’m not interested in.’”Burtynsky is clear about the fact that his images are meant to be not didactic but enigmatic, entry points and not endpoints. Although it is difficult to look at shots such as a wasteland full of discarded tires or a mountainside honeycombed by extractive mining without feeling a gut reaction of shame and eco-anxiety, his photographs are much more than just environmentalist agitprop. The artist takes pride in the many interpretations that his works can hold.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daniel Terna“My photographs are like Rorschach tests,” he said. “It’s like the teacher puts a picture in front of the class and it’s like: what did you see? If they see environmental degradation, they see something out of the history of art. If they see something, like, technologically kind of advanced, or some curious way in which we do things as humans, each one of them is a legitimate reading of what they’re seeing – the individual completes it. When people tell me about what they see in an image, I get to learn more about them than they probably learn about me.”In addition to delivering some of Burtynsky’s most career-defining works, The Great Acceleration also shows lesser-known sides of the photographer – there are two pieces from his student days, a shot from a rarely seen series that he made exploring masculinity via taxidermy workshops, and never-before-shown portraits of individual workers who toil within the built landscapes that he specializes in. “I would walk through these landscapes with my 2 1/4 camera, and every once in a while I’d see a person and say: ‘Can I take your photograph?’ It was always an acknowledgement of the sitter in their space, and just another way of showing that these are things that humans are doing,” he said.Burtynsky hopes that shows like The Great Acceleration offer a way to let a wider audience see what is happening in the world. He remains doubtful of art’s ability to directly transform how governments and industry use our resources, but he does believe in the value of raising awareness and sparking curiosity. “Artists are soft power, we’re storytellers, we don’t have the ability to influence or shape policy. What we can do is raise consciousness, absorb our experience of the world and move it through the medium of our choice. I’m trying to be a kind of conduit into what is happening.”Edward Burtynsky: The Great Acceleration is on show at the International Center of Photography in New York until 28 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPhotographyExhibitionsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Others point to the fibre, vitamins and anti-inflammatories they provide. Here’s what you need to knowRachel DixonThu 26 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareWhen my sister saw me drinking a glass of orange juice at breakfast, she was horrified. “You’re drinking pure sugar!” she said.Juice, once considered so virtuous people paid good money to go on “juice fasts”, has been demonised over the past decade. The epidemiologist and authorTim Spector has saidorange juice should “come with a health warning” and he’d rather people drink Coca-Cola. Despite this, theglobal juice market is growing, with chains such as Joe & the Juiceexpanding rapidly– and inan umbrella reviewlast year, Australian researchers found potential health benefits to drinking juice.So should you jettison your juicer and boycott juice bars? Or add a glass of OJ to your daily diet? I asked the experts to clear up the confusion.What is the official guidance on drinking juice?It depends where you live. In the US, 100% juice is a recommended “primary beverage” alongside water.In Canada, though, juice has been excluded from healthy eating guidelines altogether. Other countries tend to be somewhere in between. The UK, Spain and the Netherlands recommend limiting juice to one serving a day, while in New Zealand the limit is once a week and Australia suggests one serving “occasionally”.Are there any health benefits?Sammie Gill, a registered dietitian with theBritish Dietetic Association, says juices offer a concentrated source of vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals, such as polyphenols. Studies from the US, Canada and Iran “have shown thatdrinking orangeorapple juiceis linked with lower levels of inflammation andimprovements in cardiovascular health,” she says. “Fruit juice shouldn’t be discouraged within the context of a healthy balanced diet.”So what is the problem?View image in fullscreenOne glass of juice contains about 12 grams of sugar.Photograph: Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty ImagesAs well as vitamins, juice also provides a concentrated source of sugar (mainly fructose). Consuming too many of these “free sugars” – released when the fruit is crushed into juice – contributes to tooth decay and obesity and may put you at risk of type 2 diabetes. The WHO suggests limiting the intake of free sugars, including those found in fruit juice, to less than 10% of daily calories;the UK limit is 5%, or 30g (seven teaspoons). “A 150ml serving of fruit juice contains around 12g of free sugars, so it’s very easy to exceed your maximum with just a few glasses,” says Gill.Any other concerns?“Drinking fruit and vegetables in liquid form is very different to eating whole fruit and vegetables in their intact form,” Gill says. “You’re only getting partial benefit.” Namely, you miss out onthe fibre found in the fruit’s skin and flesh. “With whole fruit, mechanical breakdown (chewing) and chemical breakdown (enzymes) slowly release the contents of the fruit’s cells. In liquid form, fruit passes through your gut and is absorbed more quickly, which can result in a rapid release of sugar into the bloodstream.” She adds that large amounts of fructose in one go can trigger symptoms in people with a sensitive gut, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome.Is vegetable juice preferable to fruit juice?Rob Hobson, the author ofUnprocess Your Family Life, says vegetable juice tends to be lower in sugar and contain a wider range of nutrients: “For example, beetroot juice contains nitrates, carrot juice contains vitamin A and dark leafy greens such as kale contain magnesium and calcium.” With shop-bought green juices, he advises checking the ingredients list –many are mainly apple juice. And, he stresses: “Drinking green juice is never as good as eating the whole vegetable.”The 2024 Australian review concludes that while more studies are needed on vegetable juice, it could be a useful addition to people’s diets. “Vegetable consumption is even lower than fruit consumption at a population level. As such, it is important to consider the potential for vegetable juices to be incorporated into models of healthy eating to address this gap,” write the researchers. Even Spector is a fan. In his bookThe Diet Myth, he says a regular multi-vegetable juice has health benefits.How about smoothies?If they are made from whole fruits and vegetables blended up, smoothies will contain beneficial fibre – but beware shop-bought ones made from fruit purees. “Homemade smoothies are your best bet because you can use all edible parts of the fruits and vegetables, including the juice, flesh, seeds and skins,” says Gill. “Leaving the skins on can increase the fibre content by up to 50%. You’re getting more nutritional bang for your buck.” In the UK, frozen berries wereadded to the ONS inflation basketin 2023 and mango was added this year, reflecting the growing popularity of homemade smoothies.What else should I include in a smoothie?Vary your ingredients for maximum nutritional benefit and prioritise vegetables over fruit, says Gill. You can add protein, healthy fats and additional fibre in the form of milk, yoghurt or kefir, nut butter, seeds and oats. Hobson likes to make a smoothie bowl topped with coconut shavings and chopped fruit.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Posed by model; Everste/Getty ImagesBridget Benelam of theBritish Nutrition Foundationadvises keeping an eye on calories. “There’s a feeling that if it’s a drink, it doesn’t count, but of course it does. Just be aware of it and adjust other things in your diet to maintain balance.”How much should I drink a day?Dietary advice in many countries is to drink no more than 125-150ml of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie daily – a small glass. The Australian study concluded you can be a little more generous: “The multiple potential beneficial effects detected at low to moderate levels (50-240 ml/day) of 100% juice consumption can provide exposure to beneficial nutrients and bioactive compounds, without the risks associated with excess consumption of free sugars and calories.”Gill says that consuming anything in excess can be harmful to health. “Enjoy a glass of fruit juice or smoothie, but don’t rely on it to hydrate you throughout the day. It shouldn’t be your default drink … Think of it this way: it takes three to four oranges to make one glass of juice. You wouldn’t eat four oranges in one sitting.”Can I get my five a day from juices and smoothies?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Perfectfood/Getty ImagesNo. Even a green juice containing five different vegetables, or a smoothie made from five kinds of fruit, counts foronly one of your five a day, because of the free sugars and lack of fibre. Hobson goes further. “Juice is an extra – you should still eat at least five fruits and vegetables in whole form,” he says. “You shouldn’t get into the habit of drinking your nutrition. We should be chewing, not sipping!”How can I mitigate their downsides?As well as prioritising vegetables, include lower-sugar fruits such as berries, stone fruits, citrus fruits, kiwi and avocado. Consider diluting juices and smoothies with still or sparkling water, or ice – Benelam says juice should always be diluted half and half with water when given to children.The NHS advises drinking juices and smoothies at mealtimes, not as a between-meal snack, to reduce the risk of tooth decay. This may have an added benefit, says Hobson – especially for vegetarians and vegans. “Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron from plant-based sources such as dark green leafy vegetables, tofu, seeds, beans and lentils.”What should I look for on the label?“Always choose a pure 100% fruit juice, ideally with pulp,” says Gill. Avoid “fruit nectars” and products labelled “juice drinks”: “They are bulked out with other ingredients such as sweeteners, colours and flavourings.”“It depends what you can afford,” points out Hobson. “Buy fresh juice if you can – pasteurised juice loses vitamin C. You’ll still get some vitamin C from juice that is made from concentrate, but avoid any with added sugar or syrup.”Are freshly made juices better than shop-bought versions?“Vitamin C is sensitive to oxidisation and levels do decline, so freshly made juices at a juice bar may contain more,” says Benelam. “But portions tend to be very large – go for a small size.”Should I buy ginger and turmeric ‘juice shots’?View image in fullscreenIt’s cheaper to make your own health drinks at home with raw ingredients.Photograph: Almaje/Getty ImagesGill says there is evidence to show that ginger can help with nausea and that turmeric has anti-inflammatory effects. “There is no harm in taking a daily shot if you enjoy it,” she says. “At the same time, they are often expensive, can contain added sugars and different brands contain different amounts of ginger.” She notes that supplementing with ginger can interact with medications such as blood thinners; seek advice from a pharmacist if necessary.Hobson is more sceptical. “I’m not sold on fruit shots,” he says. “A lot of them are apple juice with a bit of ginger.” It’s probably better – and certainly cheaper – to use ginger and turmeric in cooking instead.Are there any benefits to juice ‘fasts’ and ‘cleanses’?“Juice fasts are unsustainable and unrealistic for most people,” says Gill. “While fruit and vegetables are a rich source of many nutrients, including fibre and vitamin C, they are limited in other nutrients – such as vitamin B12, iron, omega 3 and protein. They cannot provide the body with all its nutritional needs.Fooddiversity is what’s needed for optimal health.”‘Biceps curls while you cook!’ 101 ways to get healthier and happier – in just five minutesRead moreThere is no need to “detox”, adds Benelam. “Our bodies are very good at getting rid of toxins.” And Hobson is unequivocal: “Avoid juice fasts at all costs. There are no health benefits whatsoever.”What can I drink if I’m trying to cut down on juice and smoothies but I don’t like water?“We should get most of our hydration from water,” says Benelam – but it doesn’t have to be plain. Gill suggests flavouring still or sparkling water with chopped fruit or berries; a squeeze of lemon or lime; herbs such as mint, basil or rosemary; or slices of cucumber. She says other drink options include kombucha – “Just check the amount of sugar, which can vary from brand to brand” – and herbal and fruit teas (hot or iced).What can I have instead of a smoothie before/after exercise?Gill suggests Greek yoghurt topped with banana or berries, chia seeds and honey. Benelam keeps it simple: “A glass of milk – cow’s or plant-based – is a good alternative before or after the gym. It contains protein, nutrients and electrolytes.”The final wordIn an ideal world, we’d get our vitamins, minerals and bioactive compounds (such as polyphenols, flavonoids and carotenoids) from whole fruits and vegetables, rather than juices and smoothies. However, most of us don’t eat enough of them. As the Australian review points out, juices and smoothies are an “affordable, accessible and palatable” addition to the diet. You’re not better off with Cola-Cola – but you should stick to one small glass a day.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You’re the judge in this game of cat and mouthFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 26 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 10.48 EDTShareThe prosecution: DarrylI see the cat rolling around in poo.Georgia can choose to kiss me or the dirty cat, but not bothI didn’t grow up with pets, so never felt that comfortable around them. But then my partner Georgia and I got our cat, Ethel, from a neighbour. I initially pushed back as I didn’t want the responsibility. Now, I tell everyone that having a cat is amazing. However, I find my rules slipping. Initially, I didn’t think I’d want Ethel on the bed, but within a week of getting her that rule was out the window.I’m still trying to make sure kissing the cat stays off limits, though. I see Ethel roll around in poo in our garden – she seems quite interested in faeces. I’ll go outside and say, “Don’t do that”, but she’s a cat, so doesn’t listen, obviously. Georgia, on the other hand, is always kissing Ethel – that’s a cat who’s just licked her own bum or rolled around in poo. She thinks I should want to kiss the cat all the time too, and really doesn’t understand my reluctance.She said if I lose this argument then I have to kiss Ethel, which I don’t want to doWorse still, just after she’s kissed the cat, she’ll try to kiss me. I get really grossed out by that. It’s too much. Georgia doesn’t kiss Ethel on the mouth, but they will bump noses. Ethel will sometimes lick Georgia on the hand or face. I don’t find that as gross as the thought of Georgia placing her lips on the cat’s fur, though. She thinks it’s funny that I won’t kiss her straight after shes kissed the cat. I might leave it half an hour – I’ll have forgotten about it by then.We have different cat parenting styles. I don’t feel the need to pick Ethel up all the time, whereas Georgia loves to cradle her like a baby. I think Ethel tolerates rather than enjoys it. Georgia always wanted us to get a cat. When we lived in another houseshare years ago, she used to lure the neighbour’s cat in through the window. In retrospect, I think I was being primed to accept the idea of having pets.Georgia wrote in to the Guardian because she wants people to side with her. She says: “How can you say kissing a cat is gross?” She’s looking for proof that other people kiss their pets all the time too, but I don’t think they do. She has said that if I lose this argument then I have to kiss Ethel, which I don’t want to do. I think you can truly love your cat without kissing it on the head all the time.The defence: GeorgiaI love the cat, so I kiss her. I don’t see the problem. Darryl’s hygiene logic doesn’t make any senseI would like to state for the record that Ethel does not lick my face on a regular basis. I kiss her on the head a lot, though, and I like to cradle her like a child and I’ve never thought twice about kissing her. I’ve had pets all my life. I even had rats as a kid – though I’m not sure that is going to help my case.I probably kiss Ethel about 20 times a day. When I walk past her, I’ll kiss her little head and we rub our noses together. I don’t want her to lick my face, as I know she does lick her bum, but sometimes she just will. She’s a cat, it can’t be helped.I think it’s weird that Darryl doesn’t want to kiss her. That doesn’t connect for me at all. I find it funny and slightly offensive when, after I kiss Ethel on the head, Darryl recoils from me. He’ll pull back and go “Argh!”. However after 10 or 20 minutes, he’ll have forgotten about it and will let me kiss him, so I wonder: how long is acceptable? Do germs disappear after half an hour? It’s arbitrary and Darryl is not consistent with his stance. Kissing Ethel is so normal to me, so it’s hard to compute his behaviour.Darryl’s the more playful parent overall. That’s why it’s harder to believe that he doesn’t want to kiss herDarryl is home more so spends more time with Ethel. And he’s the more playful parent overall, which is why it’s hard to believe he doesn’t want to kiss her. Darryl also doesn’t pick her up, which I find strange. If we take her to the vet, I have to pick her up. I don’t think he’s ever kissed her.At first, I would get defensive about him not kissing me after I kissed Ethel, but now I’ve got used to him recoiling from me. One time we tried to Google whether pets are clean and who was in the right, but we found arguments supporting both sides. I’d never clean my face after kissing the cat, it just doesn’t feel natural. Also, I kiss her so much that my skin would get dry if I had to wash every time I did.Basically, it’s a losing battle for Darryl. As soon as we got Ethel, all the rules went out the window. She climbed on Darryl and loved him right away, and she has always been very inquisitive. I think he will eventually come around to letting me kiss him after I’ve kissed Ethel.The jury of Guardian readersShould Georgia stop kissing Darryl after kissing Ethel?Kissing a pet is unhygienic, so Georgia should not expect Darryl to kiss her after she’s kissed the cat. She needs to respect his feelings – though he needs to be more consistent about when she is allowed to kiss him.Sophie, 70This is all about consent. It’s acceptable for anyone to give or withdraw consent at any time; no one should be kissed when they don’t want to be. Georgia is guilty for laughing at and not respecting Darryl’s boundaries.Chloe, 51As a cat lover, I understand both Darryl and Georgia’s point of view. However, I have to side with Darryl. He clearly adores Ethel, he just shows his affection in a different way to Georgia. She loves snuggles, where Darryl loves playing. Both of them need to accept that the other’s approach is valid.Suzanne, 56Kissing a cat’s head is totally acceptable behaviour. We constantly pick up bacteria from the world around us and the vast majority are harmless. If Darryl is so worried about cleanliness, I’d be interested to know how often he washes his mobile phone!Duncan, 40Personally, if I was Darryl I wouldn’t spurn my partner’s affections, be they pre- or post-feline. However, if someone asks you to stop doing something that involves their body, you should probably stop doing it.Neil, 49Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: who is in the right?The poll closes on Wednesday 2 July at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherRuby should stop bringing so much cake into the office.49%of you said yes –Ruby is guilty51%of you said no –Ruby is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsPetsYou be the judgeRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I write these columns just over two weeks in advance, so I need Met Office/clairvoyant weather prediction skills to work out what it is we’re likely to be drinking by the time the column comes out. But I’m going to go out on a limb here and declare that summer will be here when you read this. No, don’t look out of the window. Keep looking at your phone screen, and imagine the sun’s beating down outside. That calls for a chilled red, right?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The types of red wine that fare best when chilled are those that are fruity, youthful and not too tannic. Thepunching downorpumping overof a wine can extract tannins from the skins, pips and stalks. Often confused with the mouth-puckering effect of acidity, the best way I can describe the sensation of tannins is it’s a bit like when you drink the last dregs of a cup of green tea: it tastes all stemmy and dry, and you can feel where you’ve been biting the inside of your cheeks.“In hot and sweaty Barcelona, we serve all our reds at between 11C and 12C,” says Benji Sher, owner and sommelier at the city’sFluidwine bar. “That’s definitely too cold for the super-tannic bangers, but I’d rather things slowly warm up in the glass. Better to be too cold than too hot.”“A cold wine is more a thing to drink and less a thing to savour,” saysJ Lee, a New York-based food writer whose semi-anonymous musings on flavour I trust disproportionately considering I’ve never met him. “I think the way we’re consuming wine is becoming more casual,” he says. “A cold wine is never so serious, and most other beverages that people drink casually are served cold: beer, cocktails,White Claw… I’m looking forward to ice cubes in wine coming back.”Perhaps that is the logical next step for those among us who want our reds to remain chilled all summer long? I have to confess, popping an ice cube in my wine glass isn’t something I’ve yet tried for fear that it will dilute the wine, and therefore my drinking experience, which doesn’t bear thinking about. But then I think of my beloved iced coffee. Not only is this apparently the reason I’ll never own a house, but it’s also something I suck up so ravenously quickly that the fact that the ice may dilute the coffee doesn’t even cross my mind. Perhaps that’s the thing: something as simple and delicious as a chilled red needn’t concern itself with the heat. By the time the ice would have melted, it’ll already be in your belly.

But for her show in Paris on a sweltering Wednesday evening, there was a shift to a new generation on the catwalk.Liam Gallagher’s son Gene, Bobby Gillespie’s son Wolf and Myles Lewis-Skelly, Arsenal’s 18-year-old midfielder and left-back, who broke into the first team in the 2024/25 season, modelled.View image in fullscreenGrace Wales Bonner’s eponymous brand is a decade old this year.Photograph: Justin Shin/Getty ImagesThe collection was shown in a room full of bookshelves – fitting for a brand inspired by writers from James Baldwin to Nikki Giovanni, whose poem My Tower (Pretty Little Baby) was on the show notes. Titled Jewel, it featured Wales Bonner looking at archetypes of clothing and perfecting them through her specific lens.Standout designs included a hunting jacket cut to accentuate the wearer’s waist, a tailored black suit with brown lapels and jumpers in a melange knit, worn with shorts.Different takes on glamour were explored, from the sequin chiffon shirt and lowslung jeans worn by Gillespie, to Lewis-Skelly’s simple silk shirt and trousers and models in tailcoats, carrying gloves.The collection once again had that signature Wales Bonner secret sauce: clothes that felt conceptual enough for a catwalk show, but were also seriously desirable. Those in the front row were likely making mental shopping lists as the models came down the catwalk.View image in fullscreenWales Bonner tweaked archetypes of clothing in her latest collection.Photograph: Justin Shin/Getty ImagesBackstage, Wales Bonner said she was thinking about “people who collect specific types of clothing, and what that wardrobe looks like”. She focused that around “mixing sports heritage and casual preppy language, and fine tailoring”.Part of the inspiration came from working on the Met Gala and its accompanying exhibition, Superfine, with the theme of Black style and dandyism. “I wanted to have some sense of continuity and think about that character,” she said. “What would they wear in a more everyday way?”She said working with Hamilton had been particularly important. “He has been so supportive of me over the years, it’s so special for him to give me the opportunity on such a world stage. [It was a] really inspiring process, there were definitely things I took from that language.”The milestone of the brand reaching a decade was also on her mind. “The learnings I’ve had over the last 10 years, that’s in everything I put forward and think about the future,” she said. “I feel like I’ve got enough confidence and I’ve built enough of a language and identity, we can be a bit relaxed.”View image in fullscreenDifferent takes on glamour were explored.Photograph: Justin Shin/Getty ImagesThe designer’s influence has increased over that time, along with the brand. In April,it was reportedthat the brand expected to end the financial year with 81% growth compared with the previous year, with revenue doubling since 2022.The designer’s collaboration with Adidas, begun in 2020, is central to this. It has helped the sports brand boom over the past few years – everyone from Rihanna to Rishi Sunak has started wearing her popular silver and leopard print Samba shoe.This collection moved the narrative on – it debuted a collaboration with Y-3, the Adidas label that originally started as partnership between the sports brand and Yohji Yamamoto. On the catwalk, this was seen in a tracktop and shorts, as well as football boot-like sneakers. These shoes, described by Wales Bonner as “quite iconic”, could well be the next Samba.View image in fullscreenModels walk the runway during the Wales Bonner spring/summer 2026 show.Photograph: Justin Shin/Getty ImagesThe opening ofBalenciagaby Demna, an exhibition showcasing items created by the mononymic designer over his decade at the brand, also too place on Wednesday.

Different competitors are acting in different ways. Some more aggressively and some more cautiously.”He said it was unclear how the market would develop as there was a “fast-moving situation” on tariffs, as the Trump administration had changed the rules on several occasions. Nevertheless, Ervér said H&M was aiming to be “very, very competitive” on price, fashionability and sustainability.Primark owner’s shares drop as sales fall amid Trump tariff fearsRead moreHe said the group’s wide range of sourcing locations meant it had “good flexibility” to mitigate the impact of any tariffs imposed by the US on goods imported from certain countries so that it might have an advantage over some competitors.Despite rising costs on wages, tariffs and other factors, H&M made clear there was pressure to keep prices down as shoppers were keeping a tight rein on their spending amid global turmoil and rising household bills.Ervér said: “The customer is very price sensitive.”The group, which owns brands including Cos, & Other Stories and Arket as well as its main chain, said it was likely to have to discount more than last year around the world in the coming months, as some retailers were already having to cut prices to prompt uncertain shoppers to splash out amid global events.The comments came as H&M revealed that sales had risen just 1%, in local currencies, to 112bn Swedish kroner (£8bn) in the first half of the year as it closed 4% of its stores. Operating profit slid nearly 17% to 5.9bn Swedish kroner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

FromGougane Barra, where a tiny chapel sits at the lake’s edge, the road winds through old rebel country, into deep forests where foxgloves bloom along the mountainside.Bantry House– a magnificent estate overlooking a lovely bay – marked our path toward Ballydehob, West Cork’s boho village just north of the Mizen Head peninsula.Ireland mapIt’s a suitably impressive setting for Native, a new off-grid eco-guesthouse just a stone’s throw from the village. The brainchild of Didi Ronan (who previously worked in public policy and the music industry) and husband Simon (who runs the sustainable landscape architect studioSRLA), the aim was to create somewhere that has a positive impact on both the environment and local community.Previously a derelict farmhouse, the chic three-bedroom B&B, set in beautiful gardens, celebrates Ireland’s craft heritage, too. From the communal living room – with its art books and antique maps – to the timber-clad garden sauna, every element is carefully considered. The bedrooms lean into a modern-meets-vernacular aesthetic, with muted tones and tactile textures. Ours opens on to a private patio, and above the bed are hundreds of vintage National Geographic magazines – collected by Didi’s grandmother – arranged in artful symmetry across a bespoke bookshelf.View image in fullscreenDidi and Simon Ronan are investing part of the profits from their Native guesthouse to rewild the nearby landOver dinner, a delicate crab risotto with fresh farm greens (evening meals, booked in advance, are intimate home-cooked affairs), the couple share their vision. Sparked by a flash of clarity Simon had while designing high-end eco-resorts in the Maldives, when the true cost of tourism on Indigenous land and ecology became unavoidable, they began dreaming of a new kind of hospitality. “Could a hotel not only tread lightly, but also give back to the land?” they wondered.Sustainability is baked into the whole project, from the build to what they do with their profits. Instead of conventional plaster, Didi chose hemp – a more natural alternative – while Simon ensured that every existing material was reused, from the original foundations to the retaining walls. Two new cabins opening this summer aim to be the “gold standard in sustainable architecture”, made of local timber, hemp and wood wool fibre. A newly restored barn will open as a creative hub for workshops, natural wine tastings, and collaborations with foragers and craftspeople, too.View image in fullscreenThe style of Native is modern meets vernacular, with muted tones, tactile textures and sustainability at its core.Photograph: Kate Bean Photography/PRBut perhaps most impressive of all is that 20% of Native’s profits go directly to their 75-acre rewilding site nearby – a living laboratory of native tree planting, invasive species removal, and ecological education. Guests are encouraged to visit – and the next day we drive 10 minutes along winding roads and walk across fields, their dog, Peig, darting ahead through rushes and briars, to learn more. “First, you eradicate invasive species. Then you conserve what you have, protect it from overgrazing, and then plant native trees to help things along,” Simon says.At the ridge, the land opens into a sweep of sea and scattered islands. Below us lies Roaringwater Bay; behind, the skeletal remains of an old cottage clings to the earth. Didi gestures toward a patch of young trees. “The problem is huge – biodiversity, climate – but the solution’s simple: trees, wetlands, space.”The aim behind Native was to create somewhere that has a positive impact on both the environment and local communityWe carry on down towards an artificial lake, where dragonflies hover and moorhens skitter through the reeds. There we meetSam Keane, a coastal forager and artist who runs immersive coastal tours guests can book, unlocking the powers of the sea, and demonstrating the tastes and powerful healing properties of seaweed and other ocean plant life.Native is just a short stroll from the heart of Ballydehob, a village of just a few hundred but with plenty of pubs, and later that day I wander the pretty streets, soaking up a different kind of energy: human, social, alive. It’s a place that over-delivers, not in size but in spirit. AtLevis Corner Housethe Wednesday market spills out on to the street. The heart of a thriving community, Levis is a pub, concert venue that hosts live performances from behind the old shop counter, and essentially a welcoming village living room.View image in fullscreenLevis Corner House in Ballydehob is a pub, a concert venue and food market – essentially ‘a village living room’There’s a lively art scene here too. The late potters Christa Reichel and Nora Golden helped found the local craft movement in the 1970s, still seen in venues likeThe Working Artist Studioson Main Street, and in the homegrown ceramics, textiles and artisan food shops crammed between colourful pub fronts and gable-end murals.It’s a village that’s hard to leave, but the next day I set out to explore the area further. A 12-arch viaduct from the old rail line arcs across the estuary at the town’s edge. Pastel shop fronts curl along the hill. The 17th-century Butter Road leads from Ballydehob to Schull, a bright little harbour village. I stop and follow a walking trail through green lanes and quiet country roads, a soft scenic route, edged by hedgerows and sea glimpses, once used to carry churns of West Cork butter to market.From here, Mizen Head begins, a tapering peninsula where the past is never far away. A Neolithic portal tomb lies accessible, close to the roadside overlooking the bay. I follow a path to Three Castle Head. Fields give way to a wide sweep of jagged coastline, steep tufty hills rising and falling in tandem with the Atlantic. The hike climbs gradually, then steeply,and the ruins of three weather-beaten towers, 15th-century remnants of a defensive castle on a limestone ridge, come into view. From a distance, they seem almost grown from the rock itself, overlooking an indigo bay cupped in a lush green valley. Back in the car, the road dips and rises again towardMizen Head Signal Station,mainland Ireland’s most southwesterly point. The footbridge to Fastnet signal station arches across sheer cliffs, a solid span above the Atlantic, cinematic in scale.Sustainability is only part of the story – regeneration is the next stepDidi RonanThat evening, back in Ballydehob, I discoverChestnut, a Michelin-starred restaurant, where former pub walls now host a dining room led by chef Rob Krawczyk. His tasting menu captures the season with clear flavours: preserved, foraged and grown. Everything is impeccable and in keeping with the narrative I’ve uncovered in this progressive, ecologically minded, quietly radical corner of West Cork. As Didi put it, “Sustainability is only part of the story – regeneration is the next step.”The trip was provided byNative. Double rooms from€200a nightB&B (two-night minimum).Exclusive hire of theguesthouse, sleepingsix, from €650 per night, and garden sauna experience €75.

The space, almost unique in the UK because of its proximity to the city centre, is visited2.5m timesa year.This week the beeps of reversing lorries and the clanging of construction could be heard as event staff built a huge stage and fenced off swathes of the usually tranquil park for the new Blackweir Live music festival, an event many argue does not strike the right balance between public and private use of the park.View image in fullscreenThe meadow area of Bute Park is now inaccessible.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianStarting on Friday, the site – named after the Blackweir Fields it sits on – will host for the next few weeks gigs by artists including Noah Kahan,Alanis Morissetteand Stevie Wonder.The space can hold 35,000 people and takes up about two-thirds of the park’s 12 hectares (30 acres) of open grassland, including cricket and other sports grounds, according to Friends of Bute Park. On concert days, the group estimates that approximately 29 hectares will be closed off to the public, rising to 45 hectares, or 81% of the whole park, if access routes for concert-goers are included.In a statement, a spokesperson forCardiffcouncil said that the Friends of Bute Park figures were incorrect, and that 83% of the park would be open as usual all days other than concert days.Cardiff is no different to many local authorities in experimenting with new ways to bring in desperately needed cash: the council says the festival, programmed by Live Nation’s Cuffe and Taylor and Cardiff’s Depot Live, will help meet its £27.7m budget shortfall, put money back into the city and bring an expected spectator spend of £35m.About 100 people have signed an open letter to the leader of the council protesting againstthe use of the parkfor Blackweir Live, saying the city is already home to several other music venues.View image in fullscreenFiona Peel objects to how tickets for the festival went on sale before a licence was granted.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianThey also say the Blackweir Live site has reduced the availability of vital space relied on by people who do not have access to gardens in densely populated parts of Cardiff, and may have a detrimental impact on the park’s flora and fauna as insufficient environmental assessments took place before an indefinite licence was granted.Cardiff council has pushed back against the allegation, saying that the environmental impact of the festival is being handled by event management professionals, ecologists, arboriculture experts and the city’s parks team.Bute Park’s Community Orchard, set up in 2021 after more than 50 trees were damaged or destroyed by vandals, is now inaccessible because of a 6-metre-high wall surrounding the site, other than through a locked gate. This has made it impossible for volunteers to water the trees, says Madeleine McGivern, a member of Friends of Bute Park.She said: “Earlier this year 30 mature trees on the river were cut down for no reason at all. Then temporary bridges to the site were put in the same spot, which is very upsetting.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What I object to is how this was set up, with no input from the community, selling tickets before the licence was even approved.”In a statement, a Cardiff council spokeperson said: “There has been opportunity for the community to share their views through the recent premises licencing process [with] input from the community on a range of issues including noise and alcohol licencing, resulting in a series of strict conditions being applied.” It also said that the trees were removed from the park under normal coppicing practice, because they were dead, or suffering from ash dieback.Naiya Ghuman, a student who was walking her dog Cali in Bute Park on Wednesday, said she was surprised by the size of the festival. “The site is really huge. I don’t think the concerts are a bad idea, but they definitely have to clean it up properly afterwards.”A review will be conducted following the festival’s conclusion in order to address residents’ concerns, Cardiff council said.Explore more on these topicsCardiffMusic festivalsAccess to green spaceFestivalsWalesAlanis MorissettefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It had clothing, perfume, home goods and mobile phone shops, a bookshop and food court. For Gaza’s middle class youth, it was the place to hang out and be seen.Yousef Eljojo, a 21-year-old architecture student, drew the mall from memory andposted it on Instagramat the beginning of this year. You can see it in the video above.View image in fullscreenYousef Eljojo at the Capital Mall in Gaza City before the war“I try to remember the buildings, the streets, the trees – I draw what I used to live. We were never just numbers. We are people who had dreams like you, hopes to fulfil. We had warm and safe homes.“Now, we are trying to rise again. I am studying architecture remotely, without resources like electricity or internet. I look at my papers with a burning heart, will they remain blank? Or will I colour them once again?”The conditions in Gaza have worsened significantly since he made that drawing and posted it on Instagram.“We don’t even have a single loaf of bread at home. The price of one kilo of flour is 90 shekels, which is about $26 [£20], and therefore a single loaf of bread costs $25. We’re talking about a war that has been going on for nearly two years. So, those who once had thousands of dollars now have absolutely nothing,” he says.The city has become more like a jungle. It used to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world. We were very happy – we used to go to university, learn, go on leisure trips and night camping in open areas. We also used to have money, and life was good“We were never used to life in tents, or chasing after a bag of flour, or standing in long lines for food distribution. We were the ones distributing food before the war. We were never used to such a miserable life.“I don’t know if I will die, or if the war will end, or if we will leave the country. But in all cases, I will be very happy.”Eljojo remembers a stationery shop called Pens & Pins where he used to get his drawing materials. The shop reopened in February and is still operating but Capital Mall itself has not survived, he says.Instagram video post showing people sweeping and rearranging merchandise in the Pens & Pins shop. The camera pans towards the front window, and you can see theInstagram post of Pens & Pins being cleaned and reopened in February 2025“It’s difficult for it to operate at this stage. It needs generators that require a massive amount of fuel. It also has empty restaurants and cafes – there’s nothing in them except the equipment. The building is completely shut down and no one enters it.”‘I studied while lyingunder a tent roof, terrified ofbullets’Islamic University of GazaFootage showing students graduating in the main university hall in August 2023, followed by footage of the same wrecked hall with tents of displaced families in March 2025With 17,000 students, the Islamic University of Gaza was one of three large universities around Omar al-Mukhtar street.It was bombed on 10 October 2023 by the Israeli forces who posted a video of the destruction. According to the official university website, 19 buildings and 500 classrooms across the three campuses were completely destroyed.The main auditorium, which once staged joyful graduation ceremonies, is now a refuge for displaced people. Students have scattered.Aya Talbwas a medical student. She has wanted to be a doctor since she was 10, when her parents were ill and didn’t have the money to get the treatment they needed: “I believed with all my heart that once I became a doctor, I would help my family’s suffering.”View image in fullscreenAya Talb, who managed to complete a full year of medical school under bombardmentBut that happiness was short-lived. Just one week after she started her studies the war began and with it, a whole new chapter of unbearable suffering. Her home was bombed and she has been living in a tent with her family since August 2024.Talb and her family are struggling with the the current blockade as they cannot get enough food and have to bake bread using spoiled flour.What’s worse is when hunger is accompanied by illness in a deadly way, with the spread of fleas, scabies and contaminated water, all while food is completely absentView image in fullscreenAya outside the ruins of her family home, which was bombed in August 2024She still managed to complete a full year of medical school under bombardment.“Countless times, I studied while lying flat on the ground under a tent roof, terrified of the bullets flying around us. In addition to the unbearable hunger we experienced, I walked hundreds of metres just to find an internet connection so I could attend lectures and take exams. I completed that year as if I were carving through stone with my bare nails.”She says she hasn’t been able to register for a second year of online study because she doesn’t have the tuition fees. “My family and I are forced to prioritise using our limited money to buy spoiled and infested flour, to purchase firewood so we can cook, and – worse yet – to pay for transportation just to move from one place to another during forced displacement.“You might laugh at me, but honestly, what’s worse than hunger was having to run from one street to another just to find internet access, and then checking what each professor had posted for their course. The internet access lasted only three to four hours for a fee, so I would download the lectures from YouTube and watch them later in my tent, using a small phone that survived the bombing of our home.”Abdullah Salama lives in Rimal, Gaza City. He earned a bachelor’s degree in maths in 2020 and was pursuing a master’s in data science when the war started. He couldn’t continue after the university was bombed multiple times.He remembers the many hours he used to spend in its beautiful gardens and says the university was ranked 68th globally in terms of green space.I was passionate about those gardens and used to spend hours there – it felt like a second home to me. When the university was bombed, I grieved just as I did for my own home that was destroyedUniversity gardensIn July 2024 he resumed his studies, getting online where and when he can. He is in the research phase of his degree, but says some of his friends are watching lectures and submitting assignments and exams online.He walks up to 10km a day to find places that offer electricity generated through the solar panels that were installed before the war. The power is unstable and unreliable.“We rely on alternative power sources such as solar energy. The internet is also very slow and unstable, which makes it extremely difficult for students to continue their education. This is just one part of the daily struggles we face, alongside finding water, food, and enduring many other hardships. Still, we continue to pursue our education.”‘People have no alternatives to bakeries’The Families BakeryVideo showing the Families Bakery front – first in August 2020, and then when it was damaged and closed down in March 2025.The popular Families Bakery chain used to post photos on its Instagram account of counters full of bread, pastries, cakes and pizza. Treats for every occasion: Ramadan, graduation, breakfast, nights out with the family.The posts stopped in October 2023, and the shops took on greater significance as one of the World Food Programme (WFP)-subsidised bakeries that fed people during the war and the recent blockade.During the brief ceasefire from January to March this year, the bakery received some flour from the WFP and sold it for less than a dollar. Photographer Majdi Fathi, who has been documenting the daily struggles of life during the war on hisInstagram accountand for international media, took the video above.Many children and people stand in a queue to buy the bread for half a dollar then sell it to others for two dollarsFathi had been displaced from Gaza City, but when the ceasefire happened, he returned alongside thousands of others. “My house was destroyed during the war in the neighbourhood of Shujaiya and now I am having to rent a house.”Throughout the war, keeping bakeries open has been a battle. People rely heavily on bread for sustenance and bakery ovens are often one of the only places families short of fuel can cook.View image in fullscreenPeople bring dishes to the bakery where workers will bake them in the oven for a price.Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesThe Families Bakery had to shut down again after the closure of all crossings into Gaza in March stopped supplies stock of flour, yeast and cooking gas.When aid convoys were allowed back in after more than 80 days of Israeli blockade in mid-May, some of the bakeries resumed bread production, but according to aWFP report, “due to the lack of food and desperation of the population, situations of insecurity forced the bakeries to close”.Abdel Nasser al-Ajrami, who owns the Families Bakery and is the head of the bakery owners’ association in Gaza, toldThe New Arabon 27 May that, before the war: “ …about one hundred and forty bakeries were operated, but the Israeli army destroyed about 90 and left only 50. Around 25 bakeries are working with the WFP, and we have no news about dozens of them”.He also told the UN: “The situation is extremely dangerous because people have no alternatives. They can’t bake because they don’t have electricity, energy, gas or fuel. The situation is extremely tough. Ask any citizen, and you will find out that they want to cry because of the tough situation they are living in: ‘I will die of hunger alongside my children.’ They have no alternative for bakeries.”‘The heart of Gaza City was now lifeless’Falafel SousiVideo showing the Falafel Sousi restaurant in November 2020 and in April 2025Before the war, a short walk away from the bakery, one shekel (about 20p) could have bought someone a falafel sandwich at one of Falafel Sousi’s several restaurants across Gaza City, including a couple on Omar al-Mukhtar street.“The heart of Gaza City, which had pulsated with life, was now lifeless,” says a Palestinian influencer withthe TikTok handle mta3mgaza. They used to uploaded videos reviewing restaurants in Gaza, but says Omar al-Moukhtar street, once made vibrant by the restaurants that lined it, is now decimated.Even the animals were dead and lying in the streets. The smell of death rose up from where bodies could not be retrieved from the rubbleMajdi Fathi photographed a branch of the shop as it attempted to reopen during the brief ceasefire. He found a throng of people queueing for a sandwich even though the prices had soared, with falafel costing about five times as much as before.View image in fullscreenA makeshift takeaway operation under way in front of Falafel Sousi in Gaza City, March 2025.Photograph: Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“The crowd of people jostling at Falafel Sousi was because of the closure of the crossings for 52 days, when no food or vegetables were coming in. Gaza is empty of food, whatever is available is very expensive,” says Fathi.Today, the shop might open for a few days then has to close again because of the lack of resources. “Falafel is now five shekels because chickpeas have become expensive and the sellers need firewood to cook because there is no gas supply,” says Fathi.‘A place for remembering God’Omari mosqueVideo showing the al-Omari mosque before the war and after the warThe 7th-century Omari mosque, known as the Great Mosque, is Gaza’s oldest and largest. Only metres from it sits one of the world’s oldest active churches. In their vicinity are a gold market and traditional bathhouse, both centuries old.These buildings formed part of Gaza’s old city and are the most significant cultural landmarks of a city that, contrary to the struggles of recent years, was historically wealthy because of its port’s strategic location.The image of Omari mosque’s minaret cut down by bombing in December 2023 hurt many Gazans – a terrible example of cultural history being destroyed. Once spanning an area of about 1,100 sq metres, the mosque’s usable space has been reduced to just 300 sq metres due to damage caused by Israeli attacks.So when the ceasefire began and allowed many people to return to Gaza City, the youth began cleaning up the rubble so that prayers could begin again and by Ramadan they had constructed a temporary hall for nightly evening prayers.Mosque cleaning and prayers in February 2025“It was business as usual for Ramadan in Omari, the mosque was filled with worshippers remembering God,” says a member of the team’s management.They also had plans to accommodate more worshippers during the last 10 days of Ramadan but those were put on hold when Israel ended the ceasefire and began a new military operation.‘We bring back fish stained with blood, just to feed our children’Port of GazaVideo showing different moments of the Port of Gaza, including damage to the sea wallIn the mornings, Gaza City’s port would be busy with fishers heading out to sea and returning with whatever they could catch from within the confines of an Israel-imposed fishing zone to sell at the city’s fish market. In the evening, families would arrive with flasks of tea and snacks to sit down and look out to sea.For many, the sea offered a form of escape from more than a decade of blockade in Gaza that prevented them from travelling.Even now, Gaza City resident Bader al-Zaharna returns to the coast when he needs a break but the view is very different, he says:I look at the beach and there are tents everywhere – it’s a reminder of what’s happened to usView image in fullscreenThousands of Palestinians have sought refuge and are living in tents at Gaza’s port.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe port has become a makeshift refuge for thousands of displaced Palestinians that have sought refuge there and are facing harsh conditions living in tents without electricity or clean water.More than 90% of Gaza’s fishing boats, fishers’ storage and equipment have been destroyed. At least 4,500 fishers and 1,500 workers have lost their only source of income. They are also at risk: at least 202 people working in the fishing industry have been killed, 50 of them at sea.Fisher Zaki al-Najjar, who lost his brother in an Israeli attack, gave an account toUNofficials:“Every day we go out to sea, we stare death in the face. We bring back fish stained with blood, just to feed our children. Despite everything, we will never give up the sea. This is our livelihood, and we will hold on to it at any cost.”"

If those more centrist governments that still remain sidestep the established checks and balances, and fail to use these to challenge those regimes that commit atrocities and break international laws, then the world indeed risks hurtling into the void of which Malik warns.Peter RiddleWirksworth, DerbyshireIt was a huge relief to read Nesrine Malik’s review of the war on Iran initiated byBenjamin Netanyahu, and joined by Donald Trump, and of the predictably feeble response by European leaders. It seems to have been assumed by them that the two aggressors are within their rights to have carried out the attacks, notwithstanding the terrible violence that Netanyahu has been carrying out and the lack of evidence that Iran had started to manufacture nuclear weapons.They also seem to ignore the fact that Israel has its own (rarely mentioned) nuclear weapons and that Netanyahu has already demonstrated his own willingness to commit genocide. As the print headline on the editorial in the same issue explains so eloquently, “Trump has chosen war at Israel’s behest. The world is likely to pay a steep price” (The Guardian view on Trump bombing Iran: an illegal and reckless act, 23 June).Diana FrancisBathNesrine Malik’s article is another description of something that most Guardian readers must already be aware of. The question that everyone from political leaders to the mainstream media seems to avoid is why. Why do western government policies range from supine to positively supportive of Israel’s behaviour?The contemporary version of Israel has captured western governments and mainstream public discourse to a point where it seems no one can risk asking why and how this has happened. As a lifelong liberal, egalitarian and anti-racist, I feel tainted even by stating the obvious and asking those simple questions. It is frighteningly easy to be labelled reactionary and antisemitic.Michael MooreBuxton, DerbyshireNesrine Malik is correct. We are being led by the “managers of western hegemony” – not political thinkers working for a better world, but inept managers leading us “into a void” of despondency. It requires spiritual and philosophical change to extricate ourselves, not self-serving managers.Richard AshwellWolverhamptonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Stop this madness now, 21 June) . Labour has already said these subsidies should not continue beyond 2031 – a welcome and necessary step.Cutting down forests in Estonia, Latvia, the US andCanadais destructive to biodiversity. What’s more, it makes no climate sense – for forests to recover their role as lungs that absorb carbon dioxide takes decades. Biomass, of the type Drax uses, incurs a huge carbon cost.Relying on millions of tonnes of imported wood to keep the lights on is dangerous. A strategy for energy security means investing in real, homegrown renewables – wind, solar, tidal and restoring nature to capture carbon.Alex SobelLabour and Co-operative MP for Leeds Central and HeadingleyWe have to remember that using Drax to burn freshly grown wood is better than burning coal and not planting any trees at all (as we merrily did last century).Draxis a stepping stone to a low carbon future and should be switched off once the alternatives are in place.I am saddened to hear that Canada is using virgin forest to supply Drax. This should be stopped by its government. There are other stepping stones that should be given consideration: “blue options” as opposed to “grey” or “green” options. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is likely to be a better blue option than biomass, because the CO2is removed immediately and not recycled into the atmosphere. However biomass is cheaper.All options need to be kept on the table, partly to avoid having all our eggs in one basket and partly to make sure we come as close as possible to a speedy, low-cost transition that we can afford.Tom BlandfordFordingbridge, HampshireCreative accounting has always been the refuge of scoundrels. That the UK government wants to continue to book nonexistentemissions reductionsthrough large-scale wood burning that annihilates ancient forests and use ever more taxpayer money to subsidise the scam is not only shameful, but also alarming to anyone hoping for real action on climate.At the Bonn climate negotiation meetings I recently attended, it transpired that Brazil seems intent on a big push for the bioeconomy at theupcoming Cop30in the Amazon. It’s obvious that, cloaked in platitudes about small-scale social bioeconomy measures with merit, industrial scale forest biomass energy will charge through this gateway.Burning up the biosphere as climate action is the Orwellian prospect we all face.Peg PuttFormer member of the Tasmanian House of AssemblyAt the moment, the issue of burning trees in power stations like Drax must surely be vastly overshadowed by the seasonal “accidental” loss of established woodland by the annual return of highly energetic and polluting fires in Canada, Russia and Europe.Having their likely origin in changing weather (and therefore also climate) patterns, resulting in prolonged droughts and rising temperatures, accompanied by natural and anthropogenic ignition sources, these events are likely to be irreversible, without a dramatic universal reduction in CO2emissions, as well as in the release of CH4(methane, with its dramatically higher environmental damage potential) from melting permafrosts in Arctic, sub-Arctic and alpine environments, and from animal husbandry.William CarmichaelSafenwil, SwitzerlandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As a primary teacher and PE specialist, I know that this is largely ineffective.While half an hour or even 45 minutes of vigorous exercise a day sounds like the answer, one has only to observe three things that completely undermine this: how the children travel, what is in their lunch box and what they do when they get home.Many children are driven to school and those who do walk often stop at junk food shops on their way home. I’ve seen groups of schoolchildren outside the chippy at 4pm and others walking home with a frappuccino-type drink in their hand.As for lunch boxes, it is often a collection of processed snacks, crisps, fizzy drinks and biscuits. No fibre, no protein – not even a sandwich in sight. And when the pupils arrive home, it’s often straight on the games console for a couple of hours. The concept of playing outside is alien to some of the children I have taught.The education system is invariably under pressure to address literacy, numeracy, behaviour and social interaction. But children’s obesity is not a school issue, it’s a cultural challenge that can only really be resolved by parents and the choices they make.Steve WilkinsonSheffieldHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

A backlash against it has also been growing, and many of Europe’s leaders have opposed even talking about it.Jamaica’s culture minister, Olivia Grange, said her government was asking the council to consider whether the forced transport of enslaved Africans to Jamaica and their subsequent enslavement was lawful, and if it constituted a crime against humanity.It is also calling on the council to examine whether Britain is “under an obligation to provide a remedy” to Jamaica, not only for slavery but also for its enduring consequences.“We will be submitting a petition to His MajestyKing Charles IIIto refer to the privy council a set of questions that we want answered within his current position as head of state of Jamaica,” Grange said in the Jamaican parliament on Tuesday.Nicola Diggle, an expert in privy council appeals at London law firm Blake Morgan, said the monarch could refer any matter to the council. Lower courts in countries such as Jamaica, where the council is the final court of appeal, can also refer cases.However, it may decide the matter is unsuitable for its opinion.The legal weight of the council’s recommendations can vary. They could either be treated as a court judgment or non-enforceable legal opinions.King Charles expressed deep sorrow over slavery in a speech to Commonwealth leaders in 2022 but Britain, like other former colonial powers, has so far rejected demands for reparations.The petition comes afterJamaica’s government presented a bill in December to ditch the king as head of state.Explore more on these topicsJamaicaKing Charles IIISlaveryReparations and reparative justiceAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

FinCen is accusing them of laundering money linked to fentanyl trafficking.“Financial facilitators like CiBanco, Intercam, and Vector are enabling the poisoning of countless Americans by moving money on behalf of cartels, making them vital cogs in the fentanyl supply chain,” the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in a statement.“Through the first use of this powerful authority, today’s actions affirm [the] treasury’s commitment to using all tools at our disposal to counter the threat posed by criminal and terrorist organizations trafficking fentanyl and other narcotics.”Wednesday’s announcement represents a further escalation by the Trump administration towards organized crime in Latin America. After Trump’s inauguration, the administration declared a number of Mexican criminal groups as terrorist organizations.Other actions by the US have led to friction between the Mexican government and the Trump administration. Earlier this year, the Trump administration imposed 25% punitive tariffs on many imports fromMexico, in an attempt to pressure the country to halt fentanyl trafficking and migration towards the US.Additionally, the administration began revoking visas for some Mexican political figures, preventing them from traveling to the US. According toreportingby ProPublica, the administration has a list of a number of politicians accused of having ties to the drug trade, including allies of Sheinbaum.The treasury department says its actions come after acts passed by Congress provided the department additional authority to target money laundering networks linked to fentanyl trafficking.Fentanyl leads to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the US every year. The drug is primarily manufactured in Mexico by criminal groups using precursor chemicals from China. It is typically pressed into pills, trafficked into the US and distributed nationwide.According to Sheinbaum, Mexican financial investigation agencies received information from the treasury department regarding the three financial institutions and transactions with Chinese businesses.Mexican officials, who viewed the evidence as insufficient, launched their own investigation and also requested further information from the US regarding the transactions.Sheinbaum says the US did not follow up in response to Mexico’s request.“We are not going to cover for anyone. There is no impunity,” Sheinbaum said. “But it has to be demonstrated that, effectively, there was money laundering. Not with statements, but with hard evidence.”The treasury department, in its release, included different allegations against the institutions.In one instance, the department said, a CiBanco employee created an account in 2023 to launder $10m for a Gulf cartel leader. In another case, Intercam executives in 2022 allegedly met with suspected members of the New Generation Jalisco cartel “to discuss money-laundering schemes, including transferring funds from China”.And in a third example, the department claimed that from 2013 through 2021, a Sinaloa cartel money mule laundered $2m from the US to Mexico through the Vector firm.“CiBanco clarifies that it does not hold commercial relations outside of legality, and reiterates the compliance of all guidelines established by the relevant authorities,” CiBanco said in a statement on its website. “CiBanco maintains constant communication with corresponding Mexican and United States authorities and underscores its willingness to collaborate.”Mexican banks are not the only financial institutions accused by the US of laundering dirty money for organized crime.Last fall, a US bankadmittedto helping Colombian criminals launder money. The FinCen investigation led to a $1.3bn penalty, the largest penalty against a financial institution in history.Last year, the justice department unsealed anindictment, accusing a number of people of laundering money for the Sinaloa cartel and for “groups linked to Chinese underground banking”.The multi-year DEA investigation, called Operation Fortune Runner, found that the alleged criminals used Citibank ATMs in California to launder drug money.Explore more on these topicsMexicoUS foreign policyAmericasBankingDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The bear was quick to run off, but is believed to be still at large somewhere on the site.“Given the situation there is no way we can host plane arrivals now,” the Yamagata airport official Akira Nagai told Agence France-Presse, adding that the second closure led to 12 flight cancellations.Hunters had been brought in to set a trap and police were positioned surrounding the airport to prevent the bear from escaping. “We’re in a stalemate now,” Nagai said.The facility planned to keep the runway closed into the evening.Human encounters withbears have reached record levels in Japan, with 219 people attacked and six killedin the 12 months to April 2024.Last month, a bear sighting brought a premature end to a golf tournament in central Japan, with organisers citing safety precautions.With the climate crisis affecting food sources and hibernation times, along with human depopulation caused by an ageing society, bears are venturing into urban areas more frequently, scientists have said.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

It would, he said, “play a leading role in establishing the tourist culture” ofNorth Korea.MapBut foreign tourists hoping to sample a beach holiday, North Korean-style, will be disappointed. For now, it appears that Wonsan Kalma will be open only to locals while the North slowly relaxes restrictions on overseas visitors introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic.Regular tourism is still effectively banned, although Russian tourists have been allowed to visit certain parts of the country on group tours, and foreign runners competed in a marathon in Pyongyang in April.View image in fullscreenKim Jong-un and Kim Ju-ae on a balcony over the beach.

They can also visit after 4.30pm on weekdays.“The committee resolved at its meeting on 19 June 2025 to implement a six-month trial period of mixed dining on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, commencing 1st July,” McCubbin wrote.That will allow members to bring “lady guests” to a reserved alcove area of the Dining Room, and for a pre-lunch tipple in the Social Room.On those days, the Third World Bar will be reserved for members only.According to the Victorian Heritage Council, the site is significant for its architectural features and for the club’s occupancy.The council cites high-profile historical members include the artists Frederick McCubbin (the current president’s great-grandfather) and Arthur Streeton, and former prime ministers Billy Hughes and Robert Menzies.Private gentlemen’s clubs such as the Australian Club, the Melbourne Club and the Tasmanian Club have been the subject of controversy over recent years, often riven over whether or not to admit women, and often lacking transparency about their inner workings.In London, the Garrick Club lifted its men-only rule last year but so faronly three womenhave been admitted. The broadcast journalist Julie Etchingham recently withdrew her candidacy, apparently uneasy at the level of hostility from men.Explore more on these topicsMelbourneGenderCost-of-living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

In short, all options remain on the table.”The commission is responsible for trade on behalf of the EU’s 27 member states, but wanted a steer on how to approach the economically critical talks with the White House. Trump hasthreatened to impose 50% tariffs on all EU goods from 9 Julyunless the two sides reach a deal. Most EU goods already face a 10% tariff, with levies of 25% on cars and car parts and 50% on steel and aluminium.Von der Leyen also floated a “beginning of redesigning” the World Trade Organization amid concern the global trading system is being undermined by trade wars and bilateral deals. She said the Asia Pacific CPTPP bloc,which also includes the UK, was interested in “structured collaboration” with the EU, which wanted the same. “We can think about this as a beginning of redesigning the WTO … to show the world that free trade with a large number of countries is possible on a rules-based foundation,” she said.As Trump’s deadline draws near, differences are emerging between Germany and France over how to handle the US talks.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said a quick and simple trade deal was better than “slow and complicated”. The new centre-right chancellor is under heavy pressure from German carmakers and other exporters, some of whom argue that an asymmetric deal – ie higher US tariffs on European goods – may be better than no deal.French president Emmanuel Macron argued that accepting an unequal trading relationship would be damaging to Europe’s long-term competitiveness. One EU diplomat rejected the suggestion member states were divided, but said: “If we accept 10%, how long will it last?”, suggesting Trump could launch a new front in the trade war, or that it could affect negotiations with other trading partners. “Many member states realise this is not only one game. Maybe it will affect the way India approaches us, or China.”Ireland’s prime minister, Micheál Martin, said: “Getting a deal is important for certainty so that we know the landscape ahead of us and that industry knows the landscape ahead of it, so that we can protect jobs, which is our number one priority.”Striking a more outspoken note, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said Trump’s tariff threat was “doubly unfair”, because his country runs a trade deficit with the US. He was responding after Trump said Spain would “pay twice as much”, after Sánchezrefused to commit to the 5% Nato spending target.Diplomats are increasingly pessimistic about negotiating away the 10% baseline tariffs. As this reality sinks in, two approaches are emerging: a quick deal that would mean certainty for business, or retaliation to press for something better. “Do we go into aggressive retaliation mode or are we less vocal and do a quick deal,” said one source.The US has shown little obvious interest in theEU’s offer of a “zero-for-zero” free-trade zone on industrial goods, while continuing to attack the bloc’s tech regulation and VAT rules. Earlier this week, von der Leyen reiterated that changes to the EU’s Digital Markets Act –regulations affecting US tech companies– was off the table. “Of course we discuss tariff lines, we discuss non-tariff barriers like standards and norms … but where it is the sovereign decision-making process in the European Union and its member states that is affected this is too far.”Belgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, said tariffs should be avoided at all costs. “So we will not allow ourselves to be provoked, we will remain calm, we will negotiate and we hope to reach an agreement. If this is not the case, we will naturally adopt countermeasures, but these will be appropriate countermeasures,” he said.The EU hassuspended levies on €21bn US goods until mid-July to allow more time for negotiations.The bloc is consulting on further retaliatory tariffs targeting €95bn of US goods, although the final total is likely to be smaller, if approved. The EU previouslydropped plans to target American bourbon,after protests from France and Ireland, who feared retaliation against French cognac and Irish whiskey.Merz criticised the EU’s approach as too complicated at an industry conference in Berlin on Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And really to have tariffs at the level of 27.5%, which is a scary state, it is clearly unsustainable.” Carmakers face a 25% tariff, in addition to the 2.5% that pre-dated Trump’s second term.Šefčovič said his “one wish” was unity in the EU’s approach. He was “ready to fight tooth and nail” for the EU’s interests, telling German business leaders to “talk to us, criticise us, but support us”.He also revealed he was seeking an insurance clause in any deal: “I think it would be clearly desirable … that we would have some kind of stand still clause, which would kind of prevent a surprise with sudden spikes [in tariffs] and volatility.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionEuropeTrump tariffsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Different competitors are acting in different ways. Some more aggressively and some more cautiously.”He said it was unclear how the market would develop as there was a “fast-moving situation” on tariffs, as the Trump administration had changed the rules on several occasions. Nevertheless, Ervér said H&M was aiming to be “very, very competitive” on price, fashionability and sustainability.Primark owner’s shares drop as sales fall amid Trump tariff fearsRead moreHe said the group’s wide range of sourcing locations meant it had “good flexibility” to mitigate the impact of any tariffs imposed by the US on goods imported from certain countries so that it might have an advantage over some competitors.Despite rising costs on wages, tariffs and other factors, H&M made clear there was pressure to keep prices down as shoppers were keeping a tight rein on their spending amid global turmoil and rising household bills.Ervér said: “The customer is very price sensitive.”The group, which owns brands including Cos, & Other Stories and Arket as well as its main chain, said it was likely to have to discount more than last year around the world in the coming months, as some retailers were already having to cut prices to prompt uncertain shoppers to splash out amid global events.The comments came as H&M revealed that sales had risen just 1%, in local currencies, to 112bn Swedish kroner (£8bn) in the first half of the year as it closed 4% of its stores.

Convinced that it was right, it sought to streamline information that confirmed its bias. What fell by the wayside were conflicting views.Hegseth defends Iran strike amid doubts over Trump’s ‘obliteration’ claimsRead moreBecause intelligence is ultimately about assessing the likelihood of things which are difficult to know, stovepiping means a finger is put on the scale – and that process of assessment becomes flawed.If all this sounds uncannily familiar, it is becauseDonald Trumpand some of his most senior officials – including the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, Vice-President JD Vance, the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, and defence secretary, Pete Hegseth – appear to be stovepiping in the crudest way.While the Bush administration, supported by the government of Tony Blair in Britain, turned the intelligence justification for war into a slippery PR exercise that entangled senior intelligence and military officials, Trump has applied the same approach he does to everything.Now, hissweeping statements over the damage done to Iran’s nuclear facilitieshave turned into an inevitable test of loyalty for his officials who have scrambled to toe the line, even asintelligence leaks have raised doubtsover the veracity of his claims.After the US airstrikes on Isfahan, Natanz and Fordo, Trump said on Saturday that “Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated”. But on Tuesday a leaked assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) concluded that the attacks probably only set back the nuclear program by a few months – and that much of Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium (HEU) may have been moved before the strikes.His ego piqued, Trump and those around him have made ever more outlandish claims: the attack was historically equivalent to the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombs; the operation was the most sophisticated in human history.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also said Iran’s stockpile of HEU could not be accounted for. But Trump denied that the HEU had been moved, posting on social media: “Nothing was taken out of facility.” On Friday, Hegseth followed suit, saying he wasunaware of intelligencesuggesting the material had been moved.The world has become used to Trump’s tantrums, but the trustworthiness of the intelligence – before and after the attack – is profoundly important because it speaks to the credibility of the US on the most important issues of international security.Indicative, and more important than Trump’s outbursts over the level of damage, has been the way in which the intelligence justifying the attack has been reshaped.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionTrump is not interested in listening to US experts on Iran’s nuclear programRead moreIn testimony to Congress earlier this year, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s director of national intelligence, reflected the intelligence community’s official view.She conceded that Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium was of a size “unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons”, but the spy agencies’ assessment was thatIranhad not recommenced work on building a nuclear weapon since that effort was suspended in 2003.Bullied by Trump, who last week dismissed her assessment,Gabbard quickly fell into line, claiming her remarks had been taken out of context by “dishonest media” and that Iran could have been on the brink of making a weapon within “weeks or months”.Trump’s attack on Iran, as a Rolling Stone headline memorably put it last week, was based on “vibes not intel”.Pressed by NBC why theTrump administrationhad chosen to ignore the intelligence estimate, Vance appeared to confirm this, saying: “Of course we trust our intelligence community, but we also trust our instincts.”While the vice-president framed it as a collective stance, the reality is that Trump has long distrusted the US intelligence community – a friction that dates back to his first term, when he pushed back at claims that Russian hackers had interfered to help him get elected, and appeared willing to believe Vladimir Putin’s word over his own spy agencies.In that same period, Trump dismissed intelligence assessments and pulled the US out of theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 nuclear deal signed between Iran and other countries. He also appeared to prefer his own “vibes” over intelligence assessments of North Korea’s eagerness for detente.It is that history of trusting his own feelings above the US intelligence community that appears to add weight to the suspicion Trump was personally swayed by Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,whose claims on Iran’s nuclear weaponshe has often parroted.Trump’s intervention on the issue of the damage done to Iran’s nuclear facilities is also crucially important. By setting out the narrative that the spy agencies are loyally expected to adhere to, Trump is slamming shut a door on actual investigation and intelligence-gathering.Proper curiosity and scepticism, Trump and those around him have made clear, will not be rewarded but could be damaging to careers.In the postmortem of the Iraq war, much attention was focused on the shutting down of debate within US and UK intelligence agencies – not least the lack of a culture of oppositional “red team” analysis designed to challenge orthodox assumptions.As the US president attempts to bend intelligence to his instincts, the problem now is not that there is no “red team”, but that the entire intelligence community is now expected to be Team Trump.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEspionageTrump administrationIranMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But hecriticised “interference in the legal process”and suggested Trump was offering Netanyahu support before pressuring him to make concessions to reach a new ceasefire in the 20-month war in Gaza.Gilad Kariv, a parliamentarian from the Democrats party,said: “The Jewish tradition teaches us that no person is above the law. Not even a prime minister.”In his post, Trump described Netanyahu as a warrior like no other in the history of Israel. “Bibi and I just went through HELL together, fighting a very tough and brilliant longtime enemy of Israel, Iran, and Bibi could not have been better, sharper, or stronger in his LOVE for the incredible Holy Land,” Trump said on Wednesday night, using a nickname for the Israeli leader.Trump’s words contrasted with the rare rebuke he issued on Tuesday over Israel’s post-ceasefire strikes on Iran. “Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs … I’m not happy with Israel,” he told reporters. Iran and Israel, he added, had been fighting “so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing”.In his post, Trump, who has himself facedan array of criminal charges and convictionsthat he argued were politically motivated, said he had “just learned that Bibi has been summoned to court on Monday” and suggested a pardon for the “great hero”.“It was the United States of America that saved Israel, and now it is going to be the United States of America that saves Bibi Netanyahu,” Trump said.LiveIsrael 'never had a better friend than Trump in the White House', says NetanyahuIn December, Netanyahu became the first Israeli prime minister to take the stand as the defendant in a criminal trial for corruption. He described the accusations against him as an“ocean of absurdity”.Netanyahu, 75, was charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases. Allegations include accepting tens of thousands of dollars worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assisting him with personal and business interests, and promoting advantageous regulation for media moguls in exchange for favourable coverage of himself and his family.Netanyahu denies wrongdoing, saying he is a victim of a hostile media and a biased legal system.Trump’s intervention was welcomed by Netanyahu loyalists such as Shlomo Karhi, the minister of communications, and Miki Zohar, the culture and sport minister, who described the trial as “unimaginable injustice and personal persecution”.Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, backed Trump’s call, saying the trial had been “concocted” by the “deep state”.But Simcha Rothman, another far-right politician who is chair of Israel’s parliamentary law and justice committee, said that though he believed the trial was “an example of the accumulation of … flaws” with Israel’s judicial system, it was not the “role of the president of the United States to intervene in legal proceedings in the state of Israel”.Netanyahu’s trial has been delayed many times since it began in May 2020, with the prime minister requesting postponements due to the war in Gaza and later, conflict in Lebanon.On Thursday, Netanyahu’s lawyer Amit Hadad said his client’s testimony, which began three weeks ago, should be delayed for two weeks in light of “regional and global developments”.Isaac Herzog, the Israeli president, has the power to pardon Netanyahu but has been quoted by the media as saying a pardon was “not currently on the table”.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Here, too, the Islamic republic emerged victorious.”His interpretation of the war’s outcome – designed for a domestic audience – was predictably patriotic, but also suggested Iran’s battered leadership is not yet in the mood to move on from the hollowing out of its military leadership by Israel and the unprecedented US-Israeli aerial attack on its nuclear sites.It came against the backdrop of a row in the US over the extent of the damage inflicted by the American strikes.On Thursday, Iran’s Guardian Council, a body empowered to vet legislation, approved a bill passed near unanimously by parliament 24 hours earlier suspending all cooperation with the UN’s nuclear inspectorate, the IAEA.Under the terms of the legislation, cooperation will be restored only when two bodies – Iran’s atomic energy authority and the supreme national security council – notify parliament that conditions have been met, including a guarantee that its nuclear facilities are safe, and recognised as peaceful.France demanded that Iran return to the path of dialogue. The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, urged cooperation with the IAEA, saying the move sent “a very bad signal”. The IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, condemned the vote, saying: “Iran’s cooperation with [the agency] is not a favour, it is a legal obligation, as long as Iran remains a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty (NPT).”Steve Witkoff, a US special envoy, has said he is willing to resume talks on the future of cooperation with Iran in Oman next week.But in an interview on state TV, foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said that Iran had no plans to hold talks with the US, and was assessing whether further diplomatic contact with Washington was in its interest.Iranian officials may need time to assess whether they will be negotiating to retain a completely theoretical right to enrich uranium, since in practice it no longer has any enrichment capability, or whether in fact the facilities survived the joint US-Israeli assault and could be revived.In an interview with Al Jazeera, a foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmail Baghaei, repeatedly avoided describing the state of the country’s nuclear programme, before saying: “Our nuclear facilities have been severely damaged, that is certain.”He admitted a debate was under way over whether the country should leave the NPT, since it had not provided the intended protections. Arguably, the suspension of all cooperation with the UN nuclear inspectorate already puts Iran outside the NPT.If a state announces its withdrawal, that notification comes into effect after three months, at which time the safeguards agreement, and the legal basis for IAEA inspections, lapses as well.Iran is furious that so few western countries have said the Israeli attack was in breach of international law and cannot be justified as an act of self-defence under the UN charter.Trump has announced he is lifting some US sanctions to allow Iran to increase oil exports to China, a goodwill gesture ahead of the planned talks.Khamenei made no reference to the possible restart of talks and instead accused Trump of revealing that his real objective had been Iran’s surrender, something he vowed would never happen.Sébastien Lecornu, France’s defence minister, said the the country’s military participated in intercepting drones launched by Iran toward Israel before the ceasefire was established.Lecornu said on Wednesday: “I confirm that the French military, using ground-to-air systems or Rafale fighter jets, intercepted fewer than 10 drones during various military operations by the Islamic Republic of Iran against Israel.”He claimed Iran launched approximately 400 ballistic missiles and 1,000 drones toward Israel over 12 days.Explore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The number of formal suspects is expected to rise.More than 900 post office operators were prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 because of faulty Horizon accounting software that made it look as though they had been committing fraud.The scandal, widely considered to be the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history, was the subject of the critically acclaimed ITV dramaMr Bates vs The Post Office, which aired last year and thrust the scandal into the national spotlight.The government introduced unprecedented legislation in March 2024 to exonerate people who had been wrongly prosecuted.According to the latest official figures, just over £1bn has been paid out in compensation to more than 7,300 claimants across the four redress schemes up to 2 June.View image in fullscreenProtesters stand outside the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London. They say compensation for the victims of the scandal is being distributed too slowly.Photograph: Kirsty O’Connor/PAA second phase of the police inquiry, which is being developed concurrently, is looking at “wider offences” and decision-makers involved more broadly at the Post Office, as well as Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon accounting software.Since December,when the police last gave an updateon the progress of the nationwide taskforce of 100 officers and staff, the number of documents being reviewed has ballooned from 1.5 million to 6 million.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Formally identifying a suspect and preparing to question them takes a significant amount of time due to the volume of material and inquiries necessary, so these numbers will continue to rise as the team’s work progresses.”The police, who began the Operation Olympos investigation in 2020 and by May last yearhad become a team of 80, have previously said that prosecutions are not expected to reach trial until 2027.No decisions on charges will be made until the publication of Sir Wyn Williams’ two-year public inquiry into the Post Office and the Horizon IT scandal, the first part of which is due to be announced in the second week of July.The overall investigation will look at the actions of executives, investigators, managers, legal teams as well as executive oversight by the board and civil servants.The police said that they were not conducting a reinvestigation of the wrongful prosecutions. “The offences under investigation are against the Post Office,” the said in a statement.Clayman added: “We all have a personal commitment to this investigation which goes far beyond documents and evidence.

Heart problems led to 257,000 years of lost productivity that year, while diseases of the digestive system caused 123,000 lost years and breathing conditions 85,000 years.Michelle Mitchell, CRUK’s chief executive, said: “Cancer has an immeasurable impact on patients and their loved ones. But this report reveals there is also a significant economic cost. Behind the figures in this report are real people – friends, family and co-workers – whose lives are being cut short by cancer. Through improving cancer survival, we can also have a positive impact on our economy.”The findings come as ministers wrestle with how a record 2.8 million people across the UK are too sick to work amid a sluggish economy.The charity reached its conclusions by subtracting the person’s age at death from their expected age of death. They then calculated the economic value of the years of life lost to cancer by estimating that person’s total expected earnings and measuring how much of those were lost.Deaths from lung cancer cost the UK more than any other form of the disease – £1.7bn. Those from bowel cancer cost £1.2bn while breast cancer fatalities cost £800m.Those are the three cancers that cause the largest number of deaths from the disease at the youngest ages, which leads to the most productive life years lost. They also cause more deaths in men than women which, because men on average earn more than women, results in a larger financial loss.Cancer deaths among people under the age of 50 lead to the annual loss of 119,000 lost years of productive life and a £3.2bn loss for the economy, the survey found. Those 119,000 lost years were from 5,900 people aged 15 to 49 dying in 2021.Among 50- to 64-year-olds the toll is even higher – 167,000 lost years per year, costing £5.1bn.David Finch, the assistant director of the healthy lives team at theHealthFoundation thinktank, said: “CRUK’s findings are a sobering reminder of the increasing rising cost of ill health and disability in the working-age population, which is becoming ever more apparent.“This issue is not going away with aprojected 25% increasein the share of working-age people with diagnosed major illnesses by 2040.”More people are being diagnosed with cancer and dying from it than ever before, mainly because of the ageing population and the impact of obesity.There were 140,000 deaths a year from cancer between 1975 and 1977. The figure rose to 176,000 a year during 2023-25. CRUK says that on current trends it will increase to 208,000 deaths a year by 2038-40.Finch said planned benefit cuts would hamper the government’s ambition to get more people well enough to start working again. “The government’s approach to tackling this is too short-term, with planned cuts to disability benefits likely to worsen people’s health and reduce their employment chances.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said its 10-year health plan, being published next week, “will set out how we will utilise the latest technology and techniques to improve cancer outcomes and transform care to give more families hope in the face of this devastating disease”.“This includes rolling out DIY screening kits for cervical cancer, more radiotherapy machines in every region and opening more community diagnostic centres closer to where people live,” they said. “We are also making progress in tackling some of the biggest causes of cancer, including our landmark tobacco and vapes bill to create the first smoke-free generation, and restricting junk food advertising to tackle obesity.”Explore more on these topicsCancerHealthEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s just that we do see, by far and away, the highest rates [of self-harm and suicidal ideation] in young women.”There was no evidence of over-reporting of mental health conditions, she added. “I don’t see this as reflecting over-identification or over-reporting, although there is greater awareness and less stigma. There’s no evidence from our data to indicate over-reporting, but in the past there may well have been under-reporting.”Graph of mental health conditions in women of different agesMore people with mental ill health are getting treatment, the study also shows, with nearly half (47%) of 16- to 74-year-olds with common mental health issues having therapy or medication for anxiety, depression, panic disorder, phobias or OCD, up from previous surveys. But most people who experience gambling harms have never received gambling-specific treatment or support, the survey found. And overall, more than half of people with common mental health conditions are not getting the help they need, experts said.Marjorie Wallace, the chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said: “This report exposes the huge scale of need facing a system that is already in breakdown, particularly involving the services available to young people.”It comes as the health secretary, Wes Streeting, is set to announce that mental health patients will be able to self-refer for talking therapies using theNHSapp. He said the government was “putting digital front doors on mental health services for patients up and down the country”. He also confirmed that 85 new mental health emergency departments would be built across England.Dr Sarah Hughes, the chief executive of Mind, said: “The nation’s mental health is deteriorating and our current system is overwhelmed, underfunded and unequal to the scale of the challenge. After the trauma of the pandemic, the relentless cost of living crisis and persistent racial inequalities, it is no surprise that mental health has suffered – especially for the young. But it is unacceptable that services still aren’t meeting people’s needs.”Graph of rising rate of self-harm in men and womenClaire Murdoch, NHS England’s national director for mental health, said: “Being in poor mental health not only affects people’s personal lives but can have a huge impact on employment and physical health. I’m pleased to see that the expansion and digital transformation of our services is supporting more people, with services like NHS talking therapies – which you can now self-refer to and be seen online – helping people access support to do the everyday things others may take for granted.“We know more needs to be done to increase access to care and we are working closely with the government on the upcoming 10-year health plan to create better mental health services for patients and reach more people, as part of the wider social shift we need to see in how we tackle mental health.”Dr Lade Smith, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “Now more than ever, we need urgent and sustained investment in the mental health workforce and infrastructure. The rising demand is clear. We must match it with a system that is given the required resources to respond with compassion, speed and fairness.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthHealthNHSEnglandYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not just Andrew Tate, there are many subsets of Andrew Tate on social media.”Issuing a message to “young women in a troubled relationship”, John Hunt said: “Try and find the strength to extricate yourself from that, because you deserve so much better.”John called for young boys to begin receiving education about misogyny from as early as nursery.He said: “I think schools should have far more freedom to explain, get young boys to behave correctly towards women, at the earliest possible age. I mean nursery age.”John described media reports claiming Hannah and Clifford had an “abusive” relationship as “ill-informed” and “off-the-scale inaccurate”.He said Clifford “violated us and our family in the most horrific of ways, but what those stories felt like was a continued violation”.Former soldier found guilty of raping ex-partner before murdering herRead moreReflecting on her mother and sisters, Amy said: “They are the representation of all things good.“They worked hard, loved hard, had fun, travelled, went and did the things they loved, spent time with the people they loved, were kind, caring, considerate.“They don’t stop being your sisters, your mum, when they pass away. I’ll always be one of three sisters, we’ll always be a family of five.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

But when things start to go wrong, you are directly in the line of fire. So has found Morgan McSweeney, the political mastermind credited with helping Keir Starmer win his election landslide, in recent days as the Labour party has collapsed intomoral fury over planned welfare cuts.Starmer offers ‘massive concessions’ on welfare bill to Labour rebelsRead moreThe softly spoken Irishman, now Starmer’s chief of staff, has become the lightning rod for the frustration of manyLabourrebels who backed a wrecking amendment designed to blow up the big welfare bill next week.Many of them blame McSweeney and his political operation for ignoring Labour MPs to such an extent that they missed the strength of feeling over the disability benefit cuts and just how far the rebels were prepared to go.“They just kept saying that MPs were in a different place from the public on benefit cuts and we’d just have to tough it out,” said one MP who signed the amendment. “But we speak to our constituents all the time and many of them are terrified. They just don’t get it.”One rebel ringleader was reported as saying that while they were happy with the prime minister’s leadership, they thought he should have fewer “overexcitable boys” in his team. An MP even posted about “regime change” in a Labour WhatsApp group.McSweeney has also been blamed for allowing the Treasury to focus too much on the financial case for change, rushing through the cuts before the spring statement to give Rachel Reeves more headroom. Senior No 10 sources now acknowledge that was a mistake.Those inside Downing Street also accept they should have done a better job making the moral case for welfare reform, and started doing so earlier. Starmer has been virtually silent on the issue, unless specifically asked, in the weeks running up to the vote.“The criticism of our engagement with MPs and of our communications is fair,” one senior figure conceded.But allies of McSweeney pushed back hard on claims by some Labour backbenchers that he was using the cuts to chase down Reform voters.“There’s not a shred of evidence that we’re pursuing a strategy of attacking welfare recipients to appeal to voters who feel that they’re scroungers or whatever. We’ve never used language like that, nor would we,” one source said. “These are real people and our motivation is to help get them back into work and improve their lives.”It is no new thing for backbenchers to feel underappreciated or neglected by Downing Street, and to blame whoever the prime minister’s closest political aide is at the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Boris Johnson’s troupe of Tory backbenchers fell out spectacularly with his chief aide Dominic Cummings after the Barnard Castle affair.But there are deeper tensions at play between McSweeney, whose instinct is to focus on Reform-inclined voters, and others in the party – said to include Pat McFadden, the powerful Cabinet Office minister – who believe the government should pitch to the entire electorate.While many of those same MPs who now criticise McSweeney owe him their seats, and few doubt his golden electoral touch, questions are starting to be asked about whether he is the right fit for chief of staff, which involves helping to run not just the government but also the party.But ultimately, some of those inside government whisper, the buck stops at the top. While the grumbling about McSweeney may continue, since the welfare cuts debacle some MPs have been quite openly suggesting it may be Starmer rather than his chief of staff who is not up to the job.Explore more on these topicsMorgan McSweeneyKeir StarmerLabourWelfareanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s so good,” he said. But he made no mention of his desire to sign the legislation by next Friday – the US Independence Day holiday – instead encouraging his audience to contact their lawmakers to get the bill over the finish line.“If you can, call your senators, call your congressmen. We have to get the vote,” he said.Democrats have dubbed the bill the “big, ugly betrayal”, and railed against its potential cut to Medicaid, the federal healthcare program for low-income and disabled people. The legislation would imposethe biggest funding cutto Medicaid since it was created in 1965, and cost an estimated 16 million people their insurance.It would also slash funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), which helps Americans afford food.Republicans intend to circumvent the filibuster in the Senate by using the budget reconciliation procedure, under which they can pass legislation with just a majority vote, provided it only affects spending, revenue and the debt limit. But on Thursday, Democrats on the Senate budget committee announced that the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, had ruled that a change to taxes that states use to pay for Medicaid was not allowed under the rules of reconciliation.That could further raise the cost of the bill, which the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation recently estimated would add a massive $4.2tn to the US budget deficit over 10 years. Such a high cost may be unpalatable to rightwing lawmakers in the House, who are demanding aggressive spending cuts, but the more immediate concern for the GOP lies in the Senate, where several moderate lawmakers still have not said they are a yes vote on the bill.“I don’t think anybody believes the current text is final, so I don’t believe anybody would vote for it in it’s current form. We [have] got a lot of things that we’re working on,” the senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a top target of Democrats in next year’s midterm elections, told CNN on Wednesday.In an interview with the Guardian last week, the Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski declined to say how she would vote on the bill, instead describing it as “a work in progress” and arguing that the Senate should “not necessarily tie ourselves to an arbitrary date to just get there as quickly as we can”.Democrats took credit for MacDonough’s ruling on the Medicaid tax, with the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, saying the party “successfully fought a noxious provision that would’ve decimated America’s healthcare system and hurt millions of Americans. This win saves hundreds of billions of dollars for Americans to get healthcare, rather than funding tax cuts to billionaires.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicansUS domestic policyUS SenateUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.In 1988, Moyers produced The Secret Government about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration, and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth, a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a bestseller.His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men’s Movement, and his 1993 series Healing and the Mind had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.In a medium that supposedly abhors “talking heads” – shots of subject and interviewer talking – Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: “The question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.”Demonstrating what someone called “a soft, probing style” in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn’t necessarily deny.“I’m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people’s ideas,” he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a “citizen journalist” operating independently, outside the establishment.Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw “the conversation of democracy open to all comers”, he said in a 2007 interview with the Associated Press.“I think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,” he said another time, “but they’ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.”Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.Born in Hugo, Oklahoma, on 5 June 1934, Billy Don Moyers was the son of a dirt farmer-truck driver who soon moved his family to Marshall, Texas. High school led him into journalism.“I wanted to play football, but I was too small. But I found that by writing sports in the school newspaper, the players were always waiting around at the newsstand to see what I wrote,” he recalled.He worked for the Marshall News Messenger at age 16. Deciding that Bill Moyers was a more appropriate byline for a sportswriter, he dropped the Y from his name.He graduated from the University of Texas and earned a master’s in divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He was ordained and preached part time at two churches but later decided his call to the ministry “was a wrong number”.His relationship with Johnson began when he was in college; he wrote to the then senator offering to work in his 1954 re-election campaign. Johnson was impressed and hired him for a summer job. He was back in Johnson’s employ as a personal assistant in the early 1960s and for two years, he worked at the Peace Corps, eventually becoming deputy director.On the day John F Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Moyers was in Austin helping with the presidential trip. He flew back to Washington on Air Force One with newly sworn-in President Johnson, for whom he held various jobs over the ensuing years, including press secretary.Moyers’ stint as presidential press secretary was marked by efforts to mend the deteriorating relationship between Johnson and the media. But the Vietnam war took its toll and Moyers resigned in December 1966.Of his departure from the White House, he wrote later: “We had become a war government, not a reform government, and there was no creative role left for me under those circumstances.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsDemocratsTelevision industryCBSnewsShareReuse this content"

Every day counts in the fight against cancer and with more than 2 million Americans expected to be diagnosed with this horrible disease in 2025 alone, now is not the time to go backwards.”Jennifer R Brown, secretary of the American Society of Hematology and director of the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Center of the Division of Hematologic Malignancies at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, told the Guardian that cuts under Donald Trump have “already been devastating”, with key research halted that can’t easily be restarted.“What the public needs to know is that the science that may not sound so obvious, or that they may not know that much about, is really what drives our cancer treatments and our cancer cures. And so if we cut that, we’re going to lose it,” said Brown.Cancer research historically funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which houses the NCI, “is the basic science that figures out what to target in the cancer cell”, she said. “Then a drug may be developed that may be from an academic, it may be from a pharma company, but the trials are then also run by academics and pharma in collaboration, and academics who are funded by NIH, who do the legwork to figure out how the drug is working in patients.“Pharma companies take the drug to the finish line. And so if we don’t have this basic research, we’re not going to be able to identify new targets, and that means we’re not going to have new therapies, and ultimately more patients may die.”Brown sees a direct link between NIH-funded academic research and cancer drugs for chronic lymphocytic leukemia that helped patients live longer.“People who would have died in a few months, lived for years with the first version of this drug,” she said.Hundreds of staff have been terminated from the NCI in recent months, including dozens of communications workers. “Our website, cancer.gov, is used worldwide and is the ground truth for cancer information,” said one fired communications employee at the institute, who requested to remain anonymous. “Science isn’t finished until it’s communicated.”Between 28 February and 8 April, more than $180m in NCI grants were cancelled by the Trump administration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We were working really hard on policies to make those data sets more accessible and available to the research community. And we’re all gone.”Drastic cuts across federal science funding is causing scientists to consider leaving science and eliminating opportunities for younger scientists to enter training pipelines as undergraduate researchers, graduate researchers and postdocs, according to Lavik.“The things that are transformative are fundamentally high-risk, high-reward research,” she said. “We start to move into the clinic, and that’s what leads to the new kinds of treatments that don’t just help a little bit, but really change the face of how we treat patients, how we prevent cancers, how we treat other conditions.“You have to be willing to do lots and lots of things that don’t work. There are so many ways we should be more efficient about what we do. But to do that, you really need those young scientists, those new people in the field; you need the people who’ve come into the NIH and the NCI, who are thinking differently about doing things and willing to take those big swings.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsCancer researchMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Different competitors are acting in different ways. Some more aggressively and some more cautiously.”He said it was unclear how the market would develop as there was a “fast-moving situation” on tariffs, as the Trump administration had changed the rules on several occasions. Nevertheless, Ervér said H&M was aiming to be “very, very competitive” on price, fashionability and sustainability.Primark owner’s shares drop as sales fall amid Trump tariff fearsRead moreHe said the group’s wide range of sourcing locations meant it had “good flexibility” to mitigate the impact of any tariffs imposed by the US on goods imported from certain countries so that it might have an advantage over some competitors.Despite rising costs on wages, tariffs and other factors, H&M made clear there was pressure to keep prices down as shoppers were keeping a tight rein on their spending amid global turmoil and rising household bills.Ervér said: “The customer is very price sensitive.”The group, which owns brands including Cos, & Other Stories and Arket as well as its main chain, said it was likely to have to discount more than last year around the world in the coming months, as some retailers were already having to cut prices to prompt uncertain shoppers to splash out amid global events.The comments came as H&M revealed that sales had risen just 1%, in local currencies, to 112bn Swedish kroner (£8bn) in the first half of the year as it closed 4% of its stores. Operating profit slid nearly 17% to 5.9bn Swedish kroner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In short, all options remain on the table.”The commission is responsible for trade on behalf of the EU’s 27 member states, but wanted a steer on how to approach the economically critical talks with the White House. Trump hasthreatened to impose 50% tariffs on all EU goods from 9 Julyunless the two sides reach a deal. Most EU goods already face a 10% tariff, with levies of 25% on cars and car parts and 50% on steel and aluminium.Von der Leyen also floated a “beginning of redesigning” the World Trade Organization amid concern the global trading system is being undermined by trade wars and bilateral deals. She said the Asia Pacific CPTPP bloc,which also includes the UK, was interested in “structured collaboration” with the EU, which wanted the same. “We can think about this as a beginning of redesigning the WTO … to show the world that free trade with a large number of countries is possible on a rules-based foundation,” she said.As Trump’s deadline draws near, differences are emerging between Germany and France over how to handle the US talks.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said a quick and simple trade deal was better than “slow and complicated”. The new centre-right chancellor is under heavy pressure from German carmakers and other exporters, some of whom argue that an asymmetric deal – ie higher US tariffs on European goods – may be better than no deal.French president Emmanuel Macron argued that accepting an unequal trading relationship would be damaging to Europe’s long-term competitiveness. One EU diplomat rejected the suggestion member states were divided, but said: “If we accept 10%, how long will it last?”, suggesting Trump could launch a new front in the trade war, or that it could affect negotiations with other trading partners. “Many member states realise this is not only one game. Maybe it will affect the way India approaches us, or China.”Ireland’s prime minister, Micheál Martin, said: “Getting a deal is important for certainty so that we know the landscape ahead of us and that industry knows the landscape ahead of it, so that we can protect jobs, which is our number one priority.”Striking a more outspoken note, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said Trump’s tariff threat was “doubly unfair”, because his country runs a trade deficit with the US. He was responding after Trump said Spain would “pay twice as much”, after Sánchezrefused to commit to the 5% Nato spending target.Diplomats are increasingly pessimistic about negotiating away the 10% baseline tariffs. As this reality sinks in, two approaches are emerging: a quick deal that would mean certainty for business, or retaliation to press for something better. “Do we go into aggressive retaliation mode or are we less vocal and do a quick deal,” said one source.The US has shown little obvious interest in theEU’s offer of a “zero-for-zero” free-trade zone on industrial goods, while continuing to attack the bloc’s tech regulation and VAT rules. Earlier this week, von der Leyen reiterated that changes to the EU’s Digital Markets Act –regulations affecting US tech companies– was off the table. “Of course we discuss tariff lines, we discuss non-tariff barriers like standards and norms … but where it is the sovereign decision-making process in the European Union and its member states that is affected this is too far.”Belgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, said tariffs should be avoided at all costs. “So we will not allow ourselves to be provoked, we will remain calm, we will negotiate and we hope to reach an agreement. If this is not the case, we will naturally adopt countermeasures, but these will be appropriate countermeasures,” he said.The EU hassuspended levies on €21bn US goods until mid-July to allow more time for negotiations.The bloc is consulting on further retaliatory tariffs targeting €95bn of US goods, although the final total is likely to be smaller, if approved. The EU previouslydropped plans to target American bourbon,after protests from France and Ireland, who feared retaliation against French cognac and Irish whiskey.Merz criticised the EU’s approach as too complicated at an industry conference in Berlin on Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And really to have tariffs at the level of 27.5%, which is a scary state, it is clearly unsustainable.” Carmakers face a 25% tariff, in addition to the 2.5% that pre-dated Trump’s second term.Šefčovič said his “one wish” was unity in the EU’s approach. He was “ready to fight tooth and nail” for the EU’s interests, telling German business leaders to “talk to us, criticise us, but support us”.He also revealed he was seeking an insurance clause in any deal: “I think it would be clearly desirable … that we would have some kind of stand still clause, which would kind of prevent a surprise with sudden spikes [in tariffs] and volatility.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionEuropeTrump tariffsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The American banker himself faced almost four days of questioning.The tribunal raised concerns about Staley’s evidence in its judgment, saying that the former Barclays chief executive “could be inconsistent in his answers when he felt that it would suit his case”.The ruling said: “Although we do not consider that Mr Staley sought deliberately to mislead the tribunal we have found that some of his evidence lacked credibility. There were occasions on which he did not do his best to assist the tribunal in his answers.”The tribunal added that Staley had “shown no remorse for his conduct which has led to the authority’s investigation”.Staleyresigned from Barclays in 2021over preliminary findings from the FCA’s investigation. He was eventually banned from the City, and originally issued with a £1.8m fine when the regulator gave its final decision in 2023. He also lost out on £18m worth of pay and bonuses from Barclays as a result of the ruling.The upper tribunal reduced Staley’s £1.8m fine to £1.1m in light of his lost pay from Barclays, but upheld the FCA’s ban on Staley holding a senior management role in the financial services industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He hoped that the truth would never come to light and that he would get away with it. Such a serious lack of integrity flies in the face of the requirements we place on those at the top.“The tribunal’s decision shows that we can and will act to protect the financial system by holding those in senior roles to the high standards required of them.”Staley has 14 days to appeal against the decision to the supreme court.Staley said in a statement: “I am disappointed by the outcome and the time it took for this process to play out – that was entirely beyond my control. As the tribunal accepted, I was never dishonest – it took years of arguing with the authority and until November 2024 to establish that fact and it took more time for the financial penalty to be reduced by 40%.“I have worked tirelessly for my prior employers for the entirety of my career; I am proud of the support I gave to many individuals during that career and the strategy I developed to help Barclays when it faced immense challenges. The tribunal recognised what they described as ‘my long and distinguished career’.”Explore more on these topicsJes StaleyFinancial Conduct AuthorityRegulatorsJeffrey EpsteinBarclaysFinancial sectorBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

The initial phase of the launch will offer the premium package for $49.99 (£37) a year, or $8.99 (£6.60) a month.Senior BBC figures believe there is a real opportunity to raise far more commercial income in the US. They believe there could be an appetite to pay for its brand of journalism, given the politically partisan reputation of some US television networks.It will see the BBC compete directly with the likes of CNN, headed by the former BBC director generalMark Thompson, which is launching a streaming subscription service later this year.Currently, users in the US can access BBC journalism for free through BBC.com, which is overseen by the corporation’s commercial arm, BBC Studios. Unlike in Britain, where users pay for content through the licence fee, BBC.com already carries advertising.The search for subscribers in the US is a sign of the BBC’s desperation to boost its ailing coffers. Income from the licence fee has fallen significantly over the last 15 years, while it has also had to contend with the inflated costs of making television after the arrival of the big streamers.The move also demonstrates the BBC’s willingness to explore new revenue streams to ministers as talks begin over therenewal of its royal charter– a process that will decide the immediate future of its funding model.Rebecca Glashow, the chief executive of BBC global media and streaming, said: “We see the BBC as the world’s most trusted global news brand, and we have heard that time and time again. We provide incredibly distinctive global news reporting in this market and we have a distinct relationship with our audiences, where they trust us. And I don’t have to tell you how incredibly valuable and hard it is to create that relationship with consumers in this moment.”While this is the furthest the corporation has gone in terms of charging overseas audiences for its news coverage, it does already charge for other content. In the US market, consumers pay to access the BBC Select documentary service via Prime Video, Apple TV and Roku. The BBC also owns the BritBox streaming service.The corporation has been targeting the US for some time, recently relaunching its overseas website and app. BBC.com now reaches 139 million visitors globally, including nearly 60 million in the US.US consumers who opt not to pay for the premium service will still have access to some free BBC content, including selected breaking news stories, podcasts, newsletters and radio livestreams. Licence fee payers travelling to the US will still have access to the BBC’s content through its updated app.Explore more on these topicsBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

Hg, the UK’s second-biggest private equity firm behind the Jersey-based CVC Capital Partners, decided two decades ago to focus on software investments.HG helped to take Visma private from the Oslo stock exchange in 2006 at a valuation of nearly £330m, when it stepped in as a white knight investor after Visma received a hostile bid from the UK software group Sage.Since then, Visma has grown every quarter, and expanded through 350 bolt-on acquisitions. It has 16,400 employees and reported revenues of €2.8bn last year, with nearly 12% organic growth. It made underlying profits of €893m.Other investors include Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, the Singaporean private equity firm Intermediate Capital Group, Canada’s CPP Investments and the Texas-based private equity group TPG.

Beyond the prestige and financial rewards of being the top pick, Flagg won draft night because he avoided going to a rebuilding team, where it could have taken years to gain playoff experience.By landing with the Mavericks, Flagg joins All-NBA veterans Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, and Klay Thompson, whose mentorship should make his learning curve less treacherous. Instead of enduring the tribulations of leading a bottom-feeding team, Flagg will play a key role in helping the Mavs contend for a title in his rookie season – albeit in a packed Western Conference that includes the champion Oklahoma City Thunder, Nikola Jokić’s Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Lakers, featuring the Mavericks’ former crown jewel, Luka Dončić. Expect Flagg to fit right in as a wing who can play multiple positions and contribute defensively.In turn, Harrison’s redemption story begins with the selection of Flagg. After months ofenduring intense backlashfor trading away a generational talent in Dončić, Harrison getsan unexpected opportunityto rewrite his legacy if Flagg reaches his full potential.San Antonio SpursThe selection of Dylan Harper at No 2 adds to the Spurs’ explosive backcourt that already features De’Aaron Fox and rookie of the year Stephon Castle. Harper’s ability to put pressure on defenses with his speed and aggression will lead to more open looks and one-on-one opportunities for Victor Wembanyama,already a superstarat the age of 21. They also selected Carter Bryant at No 14, a defensive-minded guard/small forward with a consistent three-point stroke.But if the Spurs are contemplating more ambitious moves, they are in prime position to trade a few of their young assets for an All-NBA player like Giannis Antetokounmpo –that’s if trade talksramp up over the next few months.Whatever direction they choose, the Spurs took a step forward on draft night and are closer to making a playoff leap in the Western Conference.Atlanta HawksThe Hawks made several savvy moves this weekby acquiring Kristaps Porzingisin a three-team trade. On draft night, the Hawks remained active by sending the No 13 pick to New Orleans for pick No 23. In the exchange with the Pelicans, the Hawks also obtained an unprotected 2026 first-round draft pick that will be delivered via the most favorable position between the Pelicans or Milwaukee Bucks.With the loaded Western Conference expected to be even more rigorous next season, the Pelicans will find it difficult to secure a top-eight spot. The impressive coup gives the Hawks an elite asset considering next year’s highly-anticipated draft class. With the No 23 pick, the Hawks snagged Asa Newell, a late-lottery prospect who unexpectedly fell to his hometown squad.In an conference that lacks a dominant team due to the achilles injuries of Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton, the Hawks used draft week to retool as every Eastern Conference franchise seeks to take advantage of the window of opportunity.LosersAce BaileyIn the weeks leading to this year’s draft, Bailey put on a masterclass on how to land in the “loser” category. Whether his choices came due to bad advice from his reps or the misguided boldness of youth, Bailey’s immense talent was overshadowed because of poor decisions which led to negative press.The third-best prospect in the draft decided against working out for teamsand snubbed the Philadelphia 76erswho owned the No 3 pick. Falling outside of the top three cost Bailey $10m and the opportunity to learn from Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, and Paul George.Drafted by theUtah Jazzeven after declining a workout and interview, Bailey lands on a team that finished with the league’s worst record and will be in rebuild mode for the foreseeable future. Bailey has enough talent to bounce back from his draft blunders, but unfortunately, he’s already found ways to make rookie mistakes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their first mishap came with the selection of Egor Demin with the No 8 pick. Demin was projected to fall in the mid-first round, so the Nets appear to have overreached by selecting Demin and passing on players with higher ceilings such as Khaman Maluach and Collin Murray-Boyles.But the Nets’ most glaring faux pas was the act of keeping all their picks. Brooklyn fumbled an opportunity to trade up for a more talented prospect or use the picks to acquire a rising star to build around.It’s possible that each draft pick will be serviceable and Demin could make an All-Rookie team. But overall, the Nets made history by selecting five players in the first round while at the same time failing to change the trajectory of their franchise.New York KnicksFor Knicks fans, the draft should be known as “five first-round picks for Mikal Bridges awareness day.” Without a head coach or a first-round draft pick, the Knicks remained dormant on day one.After a lively run to the Eastern Conference finals, the Knicks have an opportunity to take control of the East by adding a few key players who could put them over the hump. But in a week when multiple teams traded for picks or other assets, the Knicks’ decision to stay on the sideline is not a promising sign as the offseason unfolds.The Knicks, who forfeited their own second-round pick for tampering in the Jalen Brunson signing, will have to wait until the 50th pick (via Memphis) to make a selection. Knicks fans can only hope for more aggressive moves on day two of the draft.Explore more on these topicsNBADallas MavericksAtlanta HawksSan Antonio SpursUtah JazzBrooklyn NetsNew York KnicksShareReuse this content"

And, crucially, with the stadium clock at Stade Charléty more than six seconds away from where she had hoped it would be.The 31-year-old Kenyan arrived in Paris stacked with the latest weapons in track and field’s technological arms race. But having reached the bell in 3mins 1sec, just about on schedule, she found that physiology began to overpower technology.Nike PR stunt or giant leap forward? Faith Kipyegon aims to make historyRead moreThere was a consolation of sorts as she finished in 4:06.42 – 1.22 faster than her world record. The new time will not count as she was being paced by men, which is against WorldAthleticsrules.“This was the first trial,” she said. “We are learning many lessons from this race. I will go back to the drawing board to get it right. And I think there is more in the tank.”Before the race Kipyegon’s 13 pacemakers were introduced to the crowd – 11 men and two women. They included several Olympians, the indoor 5,000m world record-holder in the American Grant Fisher, and three Britons, Elliot Giles, Georgia Hunter Bell and Jemma Reekie.Then it was Kipyegon’s turn, tiny at 5ft 2in, dressed all in black. There was a wave to the crowd, a short sprint to whirr the legs up to full speed. Then they were off, ready to tackle the 1,609 metres in front of them.It was Giles who led the way, but to the untrained eye it looked as if he went off a little too fast as it took a while to settle into formation: six athletes in a line in front of Kipyegon, one alongside her, and six behind her. The idea was to allow her to draft and reduce wind resistance.View image in fullscreenFaith Kipyegon was surrounded by 11 male and two female pacemakers in her attempt at Stade Charléty.Photograph: Christophe Ena/APFor a while, her supporters in the Stade Charléty dared to dream. Kipyegon went through the first lap in 1:00.20 and hit 800m in 2:00.75. She still looked to be going strong as she heard the bell in 3:01.84, but then the pain and lactic began to rip through her, and she could run the last lap only in a shade under 65 seconds.The trackside wave lights, which she had used in many of her world records, had been set to get her across the finish line in 3:59.99. This time, though, they kept running further away from her. “I gave everything,” she said. “But I think the wave lights gave everything today too. But maybe next time I can catch up with them.”Few outside Kipyegon’s camp had expected her to emulate Bannister’s epic 1954 feat. But Nike’s executives insisted privately that there was cause for optimism that she could get close. Part of that came from Kipyegon being armed with the latest super shoes, which were lighter at 90g and more propulsive than her previous spikes. On the insoles were written two words: “fastest known”.The Kenyan was also wearing a special skinsuit, designed to help her be more aerodynamic. And she had the team of pacers to help her cut through the air quicker.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That gave executives confidence that Kipyegon could go close.Beforehand they walked around with “I’ve got Faith” T-shirts, with the company’s logo replacing the apostrophe. But faith, it turned out, was not enough. So where does that leave us? The detractors will say it was marketing hype from the beginning. But that isn’t fair. This was a genuine attempt to go where no women had gone before, and Kipyegon should be lauded for rolling the dice and giving it a shot.At the press conference, she was praised by one influencer for shifting the narrative. But her face showed that she had wanted more. “It was not easy but I wanted to prove to the world that everything is possible in life if you dare to try. I am hoping one day, one time, it will come my way.”You could only admire her resolve. But finding those seven seconds will not be easy.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Faith Kipyegon aims to make historyRead moreIt follows the controversy around theParis 2024 boxing tournamentafter two athletes – Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-Ting – won gold medals despite having been disqualified from the previous year’s World Championships for allegedly failing to meet gender eligibility criteria.World Boxing, which has since been recognised by the IOC as the sport’s international federation, has introduced mandatory sex testing and said Khelif would not be able to compete in the female category until she undergoes the test. Khelif has always insisted she was born a woman, has lived as a woman and has competed as a woman.The IOC faced criticism for its handling of the row in Paris and for a perceived failure to lead on this issue more widely. Coventry indicated that the IOC would not revisit the allocation of medals from Paris and said the organisation wanted to “look forward” and not back.Announcing the shift in policy, Coventry said: “There was overwhelming support that we should protect the female category. And with that, we will set up a working group made up of experts and international federations.“It was agreed by the members that the IOC should take a leading role in this,” she added. “And that we should be the ones to bring together the experts and the international federations and ensure that we find consensus.“We understand that there will be differences depending on the sports. But it was fully agreed that as members that, as the IOC, we should make the effort to place emphasis on protection of the female category.”Coventry’s remarks followed two days of “Pause and Reflect” workshops in Lausanne, where the new IOC president spoke to members about their concerns and how to push the organisation forward.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pair were approaching turn one and Norris ran out of room when trying to take the inside line, clipped the back of Piastri’s car and was edged into the pit wall, sustaining damage that took him out of the race. Piastri went on to finish fourth and the championship leader is 22 points ahead of Norris in the title fight.Brad Pitt in the paddock: how F1 the Movie went deep to keep fans comingRead moreNorris immediately took responsibility for the accident after the race and apologised to Piastri and his team for his misjudgment.Speaking before this weekend’s Austrian Grand Prix, the 11th race of the 24-meeting season, Norris confirmed he and the team engaged in extensive talks about the incident, with the British driver believing it had been a beneficial process.View image in fullscreenLando Norris, in the paddock at the Red Bull Ring racetrack in Austria, revealed he has had ‘not the most joyful’ talks with this team about the incident in Canada.Photograph: Darko Bandić/AP“Not the most joyful conversations but conversations that needed to be had clearly,” he said. “Some very constructive things and in an unfortunate way but a good way I think many things have come out stronger than I would say they were prior to the weekend. Which you might not expect but is a good outcome. Through an unfortunate circumstance a lot has been learned and a lot of things have turned into being stronger than they were before.”Norris confirmed that the rules of engagement atMcLarenremained as they were before the incident and that he and Piastri were on good terms. The drivers are still free to race but clearly greater emphasis has been placed on doing so without taking one another out, a lesson the British driver felt he had taken on board and that he and Piastri were both committed to not jeopardising McLaren’s success by infighting.Quick GuideRussell hints at Verstappen talksShowRussell opens up on contract talksGeorge Russell has suggested his contract renewal talks with Mercedes are being held up because the team are still keen to sign Formula One champion Max Verstappen.The 27-year-old Briton, winner in Canada two weeks ago, is out of contract at the end of the season while four-times champion Verstappen has a deal with Red Bull until 2028, subject to get-out clauses.Russell told Sky Sports television at the Austrian Grand Prix that Mercedes, constructors’ champions eight years in a row from 2014-2021 and currently second to McLaren, wanted to return to the top.“If you’re going to be back on top you need to make sure you’ve got the best drivers, the best engineers, the best pit crew, and that’s what Mercedes are chasing,” he said.“So, it’s only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing. But from my side, if I’m performing as I’m doing, what have I got to be concerned about? There are two seats in every Formula One team.“Mercedes boss Toto Wolff made his interest in Verstappen clear last year as he sought a replacement for seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton.In the end 18-year-old Italian rookie Kimi Antonelli was handed the opportunity and has been setting a string of age records, drawing strong support from fans.ReutersPhotograph: Alessio Morgese/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The trust and the honesty that Oscar and I have for one another, it’s important that we keep it up,” he said. “We stay strong as a team because we don’t want to have the downfall that we know many other teams have had in the past.“We want to race each other fair and hard and on the limit and not have a repeat of what happened last time out and that takes both of us, even though Canada was on me.

Photograph: The FA/Getty ImagesChelsea forward on the way her brothers sharpened her skills and how the country can get behind the LionessesByDonald McRaeThu 26 Jun 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 14.16 EDTShare‘Ithink it was in me from when I was young,” says Lauren James of the fierce competitive drive that has taken her from playing football with her brothers, Josh and Reece, in a park behind their house in Mortlake, south-west London, to England’s opening match ofEuro 2025against France in Zurich on 5 July. The 23-year-old returns from injury as the most likely catalyst for England’s hopes of remaining European champions because she has the skill and tenacity to be one of the tournament’s standout players.“It helped playing with my brothers all the time,” James says as she reflects on a footballing journey when her prodigious talent has blossomed with Chelsea and England while being tested by insidious abuse and racism. We need two interviews to get a little closer to the tangled heart of her story, but her natural reticence and reluctance to open up deserves respect.Women’s Euro 2025 team guides: ItalyRead moreLauren and Reece James are the first sister and brother to play international football for England and their free-flowing games in the rainy or sunlit park, with Josh and other boys from their neighbourhood, provided the bedrock for her career. She was always the only girl, fighting for the ball before dribbling away on mazy runs, dreaming she was Eden Hazard, while the older boys tried to stop her.A little smile crosses her face when I ask whether her fire was forged in those park games which were as joyous as they were tough. “Yes and sometimes it’s your only option because they’re stronger and quicker than you so your only chance is to be better on the ball. They never went easy on me because they never wanted me to beat them. It was always hard against them.”James started playing seriously when she was “five or six” and believes that those Mortlake days shaped her: “I’d say so because being able to protect the ball obviously helped.”She was fortunate to come from a close-knit family with her parents, Nigel and Emma, pouring so much into their football-crazy children. Her dad is a gifted coach and more than two dozen players have become professional footballers after being guided by him atthe Nigel James Elite Coaching academyin Wimbledon.His philosophy, evident in his daughter’s play, is highlighted on his website: “The Nigel James Elite Coaching programme is about pure ball mastery and delivery with panache, to ultimately create elite technicians of the game.”View image in fullscreenLauren James with her brother Reece at the 2025-26 Chelsea kit launch.Photograph: CFC/Getty ImagesEmma, a nurse for the NHS, spent hours ferrying the kids to and from training and matches. Josh and Reece joined the academies at Fulham and Chelsea and Lauren would be taken to their sessions where, while kicking a ball around on the touchline, her startling gifts were noticed.She began training with Chelsea’s under-10 girls’ team when she was six and at 13 she was signed by Arsenal. As Reece remembered a few years ago: “Me and Lauren played in a number of tournaments together in the same team. We won a lot of tournaments together and it was great playing with her.”James can recall only one tournament with Reece and one or two playing with Conor Gallagher and Jacob Maddox, both future professionals. She shrugs when I ask whether Gallagher, the Atlético Madrid midfielder who has won 21 caps for England, stood out. “When everyone’s young you don’t really notice as much.”Did she face sexism? “Not when I was younger. It was maybe there when I went to Arsenal and trained at the boys’ academy. It took a few sessions because at first they were like: ‘There’s a girl with us.’ But when they got to realise what I could do, they accepted me.”Her years at Arsenal were difficult and in 2023 Nigel spoke in detail toThe Beautiful Game podcast: “She was too good to train with the Arsenal girls when she first went in … so Pedro [Martínez Losa], the manager at the time, brought her in to train with the women.“Your 14-year-old daughter is now training with women who are 35, 28, grown women. People would see this little girl. Some could take it and put their arm around her and some would say: ‘You shouldn’t be here. You should be at school.’“There was a game [where] the manager let her take a penalty. The next day senior players didn’t like it and they asked for her to be removed from the first-team squad and to go back into the academy.“They came up with a solution that she train with the Arsenal academy boys … it was a big thing because it had never happened before – a girl training with the boys – and some parents didn’t like it. But she was superb.”View image in fullscreenLauren James takes part at a McDonald’s Fun Football grassroots event.Photograph: Bumblebee PhotographyOur first interview is at Hanwell Town FC during aMcDonald’s Fun Footballgrassroots programme of free sessions for five to 11-year-olds. “It’s nice to see so many girls playing football on a big pitch,” James says. “With this summer at the Euros, hopefully we can inspire more to play football.”Her presence, both as a brilliant footballer and a young mixed-race woman, clearly inspires the girls from diverse backgrounds who look up to her in Hanwell. But, in an empty dressing room after the session, I ask whether she had felt lonely as a girl playing first-team football with women: “I wouldn’t say lonely. We just didn’t really have much in common … I was just burning to train.”Casey Stoney, who won 130 caps for England, played with James at Arsenal and had been floored by the teenager’stechnical abilityand strength. In 2018, as Manchester United’s manager, Stoney signed the 16-year-old. “She took me to United and took care of me,” James says. “It was difficult, at the start but I got used to it and in our first season we won the Championship [and promotion to the WSL]. I scored quite a few goals.”James scored 22 goals in 40 league games for United between 2018 and 2021, but her success was already shadowed by racism. In February 2021, she wrote apowerful articlein the Daily Telegraph that began: “I’m 19-years-old and I’m sitting here, writing about racist abuse. It is mad. All because of the colour of my skin. I’m proud of my skin, I love my skin colour. But when I saw the comments on my Instagram feed, it hurt.”Lauren JamesShe added: “Racism doesn’t just exist online, of course. It can be in the everyday things – even just going to the supermarket. There are times I’ve been to get my shopping and you get that feeling that people are intimidated by your presence. They’ll move away, pull their children in closer or just look at you in a certain way. It’s difficult to talk about.”It is even more difficult for James to discuss now because of the extreme racism shesuffered onlineafter she was sent off while playing for England against Nigeria in the 2023 World Cup. James hadlit up the tournamentin the group stages, but all her shimmering virtuosity was swamped by horrendous vitriol.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I ask whether she found it difficult to speak out against racism at 19? “Yeah, but it needed to happen.” Has that abuse lessened? “No. I don’t think it gets better … [but] you always live in hope.”James loves playing football, rather than doing interviews, but she still sees value in talking “because it might help the next girl who’s going to be in my position”. She also helps others from diverse backgrounds through her scholarship which in its first year has supported five young girls in London.In our second interview, I ask her what could be done to curb the abuse that she and so many other young women encounter. “Have a break from social media because I don’t think it will go away. Maybe it will die down a bit but, if it won’t, then leave.”It seems wrong the victim should have to disappear. Surely we can all do more to put pressure on social media companies to sanction those who abuse others? “You have those little things on apps where you can report this. But not much gets done. They should take the reports more seriously.”You always need the belief that you’ll make it and be fitJames can sweep aside the negativity through her imperious presence on the pitch. Despite an injury-affected season, her workrate and tracking back have improved dramatically and added a considerable new dimension to her game.HasSonia Bompastor, who replaced Emma Hayes as manager before Chelsea’streble-winning campaign, been instrumental in this development? “She’s added more intensity to us. We have to press a lot more and use a different style of play. She’s added more to my game when I don’t have the ball.”Did James feel some trepidation whenHayes, who had been so influential, left Chelsea to take over the US national team? “It was hard at first but I got used to it and now I’m cool. Emma left Sonia with a top team and she built that winning culture Chelsea are known for. But Sonia is one of the most competitive people I’ve come across. It’s not just about football – whatever it is, she wants to beat you. That gets passed down in the dressing room and in training – always thinking about the next thing we can win.”View image in fullscreenLauren James stands in an ice bath during an England training and recovery session.Photograph: Harriet Lander/FA/Getty ImagesJames points out that Chelsea winning the WSLsix times in a row“is quite amazing” but the need to conquer Europe remains. A hamstring injury meant she missed Chelsea’shumiliationagainst Barcelonain the Champions League semi-final. “I want to be playing, especially in the big games, so it was hard to watch. The 8-2 [aggregate score] makes it sound ridiculous, but we got chances. The difference is they put theirs away. We have just got to keep working and believing in ourselves.”How else has Bompastor improved James as a player? “She’s pushed me because she’s quite demanding. She always wants more which helps you to be better.” Does she like being pushed? “Yes,” James says instantly. She is equally clear when asked whether she targets individual awards such as the Ballon d’Or Féminin. “For sure. You always want to help your team and help them win things, because that plays a part in you winning these individual trophies. That’s certainly one of my aims … hopefully injuries and form help me to stay on track.”James always thought she wouldovercome her hamstring problemin time for the Euros. “The moment you have doubts, you’re putting stress on your body. You need the belief that you’ll make it and be fit. I also looked at the timing and thought: ‘Oh, it’s still a while away.’ That also gave me belief.”The Euros are close now and James’s importance to England is accentuated by the surprise absence of the vastly experiencedMillie Bright,Fran KirbyandMary Earps. Did Bright, her Chelsea captain, tell James of her need tostep away from the pressuresof football? “No, I had no clue. I think everyone is different. Sometimes people may be silent and no one knows what’s going on.”James was a spectator when England beat Germany so memorably in the 2022 European final at Wembley. “It’s not really about defending a title because it’s a completely different team,” she says of England’s squad in Switzerland. “This team’s got a lot of youth in it and this will be some people’s first big tournament.”She also describes “a fresh start, a bit like a new era” and “hungry girls wanting to do well”. Can England win the Euros? “I hope so. We’ll just take it game by game and hopefully have momentum and the belief of the fans and everyone in the country behind us.”There is just time to think once more of those Mortlake days and the blistering games she played with her brothers. Her parents will be in Switzerland to support her, but will Josh and Reece also be watching their little sister? She grins: “I’d like to think so.”They could be in for a treat because, despite the adversity and personal challenges, James is emphatic when asked what she needs to do next to fulfil her potential: “Keep improving, scoring, helping the team and winning competitions.”Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen's Euro 2025Women's footballChelsea WomeninterviewsShareReuse this content"

While Pep Guardiola’s men remain in search of their smoothest rhythms, topping Group G is impressive and whoever they face here next will not relish their task.‘My head is here’: Ederson dismisses Manchester City exit talk as fake newsRead moreCity were awaiting the later ­conclusion of Real Madrid’s group to discover their last-16 opponents, who will kick off against them at the cooler time of 9pm on Monday. The manager was delighted.“Everybody gave an incredible performance,” said Guardiola. “It has been a long time since we had a performance like this on and off the ball. The players were committed and we are happy to beat a top side. In the previous two games we won but were miles away. I’m really pleased because the players have to realise [and did today] what we have to do to get back to what we were the last decade.”For the attempt to beat Juve and make it three wins from three games, Rodri was handed a first start since last September’s draw with Arsenal in which he suffered the anterior cruciate ligament injurythat ruled him outuntil the season’s closing moments. He lasted65 minutes.“He’s the best player in the world,” said Guardiola. “He was missed, that was clear. I’m happy hopefully he can help us a lot.”For City’s opener Rodri tapped the ball to Rayan Aït-Nouri, who slipped in Jérémy Doku along the left channel: a sidestep created time and the cleanly struck finish gave Juve’s goalkeeper, Michele Di ­Gregorio, no chance.Yet City’s advantage was ­cancelled out immediately by a careless ­Ederson, whose pass found Teun ­Koopmeiners instead of a teammate. The Dutchman pounced and the goalkeeper’s cheeks went as pink as his strip. It was as clownish as Pierre Kalulu’s contribution when City regained the lead. A lightning Matheus Nunes run was located by Savinho. The right-back zipped the ball over and Kalulu, with no opponent near, panicked and turned the ball in.View image in fullscreenCalamity for Juventus as Pierre Kalulu turns the ball into his own net to restore City’s lead.Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/ReutersAn own goal, sure, but one forced by this far sharper City. A 60-65% first period possession count was potent: Aït-Nouri, Doku, Nunes and Omar Marmoush, at centre-forward, swapped zones across City’s front to cause havoc, the latter’s pirouette-then-shot an illustration. Tijjani Reijnders, from deep, joined in too, serving a slicing ball to Savinho who cut inside but dribbled tamely at Di Gregorio.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The broiled crowd in Orlando – including Thomas Tuchel – appreciated it as much as the players, though the concern in Orange County can be dangerous electrical storms that halt games. But the rain eased, and ­Marmoush’s fierce shot, tipped around a post by Di Gregorio, closed the half.Haaland replaced ­Marmoush and a better-timed stab at Savinho’s cross would have made it 3-1 moments into the second half. The miss spoke of a player who had scored only once from open play in 10 ­previous City appearances. But the statistic soon became two in 11 and completed the ­Norwegian’s landmark third century.Nunes, again, was the provider, another sprint along the right this time ­spotted by Reijnders. The Portuguese rolled the ball to Haaland; he miskicked but it bobbled in, with Di ­Gregorio stranded. The 24-year-old’s second goal of the competition had his team cruising. Juve had faded as any kind of force. The contest continued to take part in their half.Off went Rodri, unscathed, to be replaced by Ilkay Gündogan, and Phil Foden came on for the effervescent Doku. Guardiola’s move became seer-like as City’s fourth was scored by Foden. Haaland galloped through an inside-right zone and passed. Savinho pinged the ball to Foden, who collected his second of thisClub World Cupcalmly from close range. Savinho’s rocket rounded off an emphatic win. Dusan Vlahovic’s late finish for Juve will have annoyed Guardiola – but not for long.Of Haaland’s feat, Guardiola said: “Congrats on 300 goals – it’s good, right? His manager was incredible at football – he scored 11 career goals.

Photograph: David Catry/SPP/ShutterstockPernille Harder will lead from the front but Germany and Sweden are favourites to progress from Group CBySofie Engberg MunchThu 26 Jun 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 19.15 EDTShareThis article is part of theGuardian’sEuro 2025 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 16 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two teams each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 2 July.OverviewEverything was going fine for Denmark in the buildup. There weren’t too many injury worries or key players retiring. Results had been decent – until the last Nations League game against Sweden. With everything to play for, Denmark not only lost the match that could have secured them a first-place finish in League A for the first time – they were demolished 6-1 by the side they are playing in their first game at Euro 2025. “I’ve been part of this team for many years but I think this is the worst I’ve experienced,” the midfielder Sanne Troelsgaard told Aftonbladet after the game. “We need to take a good look at ourselves.”That disappointment will cast a shadow over Denmark’s hopes, but there is still optimism. Qualifying for the tournament was impressive, including getting close to a famous result in Spain: Andrée Jeglertz’s side were 2-0 up after 72 minutes in Tenerife, but ultimately lost 3-2.The Czech Republic and Belgium posed few problems and with an attacking, possession-based style, hopes of asilver-summer a la 2017have been reignited. “Naturally, we dream of winning medals, and we will give everything to create an unforgettable red-and-white summer together with the Danish fans,” said the captain and star striker Pernille Harder.This will be the first, and only, major tournament under the Swedish head coach Jeglertz, and he has a few tactical puzzles to solve. Firstly, Denmark won’t have played another match before heading to Switzerland, meaning that 6-1 defeat is the last outing before they face Sweden again. Secondly, question marks remain over the preferred starting XI – particularly the right-sided position in the back three, as well as the right wing-back role, both still up for grabs.DenmarkThe coachAndrée Jeglertzhas been in charge of Denmark since autumn 2023, when he replaced Lars Søndergaard after the last-16 exit from the World Cup. His contract runs out in the summer and he has made it clear he does not want to extend it. A return to club football beckons. Jakob Michelsen will take over after the tournament, inheriting a squad that Jeglertz has shaped to compete with – and on their day beat – the best. Born in Malmö, Jeglertz managed several top clubs in Sweden, including leading Umeå to a Champions League title in 2004. He also spent six years as head coach of Finland women.Star playerPernille Harderwill go down as one of the greatest players in Danish football history. The all-time top scorer is an icon and an inspiration for countless girls and boys across the country. “She’s a legend and it’s a huge honour to be allowed to play alongside her,” the goalkeeper Maja Bay Østergaard has said. “She’s simply a world-class star.” Jeglertz agrees: “She’s not just a player, but a great role model … in everything she does,” he told Bold.dk. Harder is an eight-time Danish player of the year, two-time Uefa Women’s Player of the Year and twice a winner ofThe Guardian’s Top 100.One to watchSara Holmgaardhas enjoyed a standout season at Everton, voted women’s player of the season by her teammates. Scoring an Olimpico goal [direct from a corner] and setting up others, she’s been a constant threat down the left. After such an impressive campaign it’s no surprise that bigger clubs have taken noticeand made her a target this summer. And it’s not just at club level where she’s made her mark – Holmgaard has also cemented herself as Denmark’s first-choice left wing-back, edging out Sofie Svava of Lyon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The major broadcaster TV 2 has acquired the rights from next season, and some of the biggest clubs in the men’s game, such as FC Copenhagen and FC Midtjylland, are slowly climbing up the divisions, helping to attract bigger crowds and more sponsors. Despite this, however, Fortuna Hjørring remained the team to beat in 2024-25, proving unstoppable and winning the double. While it remains largely semi-professional, with most of the best Danish players playing abroad, progress is being made. Brøndby, for example, became the first club to go fully professional last winter.Realistic aim in SwitzerlandDenmark have the quality to beat anyone, and their ambition is to advance from the group stage. But Sweden and Germany look stronger, and for that reason, the group stage will most likely mark the end of the road.The Denmark team guide was written by Sofie Engberg Munch forTV 2 Denmark.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euros 2025: Guardian Experts’ NetworkDenmark women's football teamWomen's footballWomen's Euro 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

But there was only one player everyone wanted to talk to on a balmy evening in Bratislava after the forward’s match-winning displayagainst the Netherlands.Two brilliant goals from Elliott on Wednesday ensured England will face Germany on Saturdaynight as they try to successfully defend the European Under-21 titlewon in 2023. The Liverpool player’s only regret was his ill-advised knee-slide celebration on a “ridiculously dry” pitch for the first of those.‘Crazy experience’: Elliott and Carsley sense England Under-21s have belief to retain EurosRead more“The emotions got the best of me and I’ve hurt my knee from it but who cares?” said Elliott having emerged from the changing room after a mandatory drugs test. “Hopefully I should be fine for the final.”Elliott spent most of the season on Liverpool’s bench after missing several weeks with a foot injury, getting only two Premier League starts – both after the title had been won – but he is making the most of his opportunity to shine for England. Four goals leave him two behindGermany’s 6ft 6in striker Nick Woltemadein the race for the golden boot and underline Elliott’s status as one of Europe’s most promising talents.Elliott cast doubt over his future when he arrived in Slovakia a fortnight ago. Fulham, who sold him toLiverpoolas a 16-year-old for a then record compensation fee of £4.3m, Brighton and Crystal Palace are among the clubs understood to have shown an interest in signing him.“I don’t really want to be wasting years of my career because it’s a short career,” he said. “You don’t know what’s going to happen. I need to reflect. I want to improve and be the best possible version of myself. If that’s to go somewhere else, then it’s a decision I’m going to have to make.”Quick GuideBeadle heading for Birmingham loanShowBirmingham are poised to announce the signing of the England Under-21 goalkeeper James Beadle from Brighton on a season's loan. Beadle, who joined Brighton from Charlton in 2022, has had two previous loans in the Championship with Sheffield Wednesday and made 38 appearances for them last season. He has played every match for England at the European Under-21 Championship in Slovakia and is expected to keep his place for Saturday's final against Germany.Ed AaronsWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and thenew £116m signing Florian Wirtzahead of him, Elliott can hardly be blamed for thinking his opportunities are likely to be limited again next season if he remains at Liverpool. Part of the problem has been his versatility, able to play in several attacking roles and a midfield three, without it being obvious which is his position. Lee Carsley has used him mainly on the right of England’s attack or as a second striker – the position he took up for the superb individual winning goal against the Netherlands.Elliott is one of two squad members who triumphed in Georgia two years ago – the other being the Toulouse defender Charlie Cresswell – although he played only eight minutes of the final after coming on for Cole Palmer.View image in fullscreenHarvey Elliott scores for Liverpool at Brighton in May, with the Premier League title already won.Photograph: John Walton/PA“He was definitely frustrated at the last tournament with the amount of game time he had,” Carsley said. “Him and Charlie, they had to be patient and they showed during the qualifying campaign they were ready to lead and carry the team on along with the other players.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What I have seen is someone who is determined to play and get the minutes. He’s definitely built into the tournament, having not had much game time towards the end of the season.“We’ve had to manage his minutes in terms of the amount he has played and the intensity he plays at. He’s so explosive with the way that he moves and with his end product. We are very lucky to have him.”Elliott may have a decision to make in the coming weeks, although for now his sights are set on leading an inexperienced group to glory in a final when the England senior head coach, Thomas Tuchel, will be present. Reflecting on his role as one of the senior players, the 22-year-old said spending the past six years at close quarters with players such as Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah had been hugely beneficial.“Coming from Liverpool, there’s a lot of leaders in that team,” he said. “Now it’s using my learning, using what I’ve seen the leaders at Liverpool do and how they construct the team. When times are tough, how they bring themselves back up and the team back up.“There’s so many emotions throughout the game: highs, lows, where we feel tired. Just using what I’ve learned and being around to try and keep the guys going, keep the team going.”Explore more on these topicsEngland Under-21sEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Do the defendants have experts that say there is a quantum under which safety is maintained?“If that is the case, we say that the case continues but on the basis that the defendants will have exceeded even that safe level, unless they are going to say starkly that heading of the ball is safe, however much you do it.”The Football Association, English Football League and FA of Wales are joint defendants in the case and Michael Kent KC, acting on behalf of the EFL, said this definition meant the court was now hearing a “completely different” case from one looking at individuals who had experienced concussion on the pitch.View image in fullscreenThe England World Cup winner Nobby Stiles was found to have a progressive brain condition after he died in 2020.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyAnalysing the risk of repeated heading meant that “we are dealing with allegations related to something which would not at the time have produced any identifiable problem,” he said. “It’s a cumulative but invisible injury over a period, completely different from a case based on a huge number of references to concussions and their management.”Rodway said that a further 90 individuals have agreed to join the legal action and that “we remain of the view that this could go as high as 150”. The claimants include thefamily of the former England midfielder and 1966 World Cup winner, Nobby Stiles, who had dementia and died in 2020.

With the team having beenbowled out for 180 on the first dayof the first Test against West Indies in Barbados, Australia’s quicks turned around and returned the favour, keeping West Indies to 190, the lead to 10, and making the match a one-innings shootout in an often chaotic day. The second Australian batting effort then stuttered to 65-4, before improving the score by stumps to 92, a lead of 82.Usman Khawaja refuses SEN interview after radio station’s sacking of journalistRead moreSpare yet another thought for Shamar Joseph. In three career outings against Australia, the West Indies pace prodigy has been a bowling Mozart, but he runs towards a slip cordon with more drops than Tiësto. In the first innings after getting Sam Konstas lbw, his notional catchers put down chances from Cameron Green and Usman Khawaja in the space of 10 balls, and Nathan Lyon later in the innings. Second time around was even more galling: tearing in for his first over, hitting an irresistible line with pace, and having Konstas dropped twice in three balls.After the first day’s play he spoke on television about accepting mistakes. “One thing I learned about Test cricket is patience. Me running in, nicking batsmen off, getting dropped catches – there’s nothing I can do about that. All I need to do is go back to my mark and see if I can do it again.” But that patience must have been tested the second afternoon as he walked back to fine leg, smiling thinly to the heavens, while winning warm applause from the largely Australian crowd in the lower bay of the Worrell, Weekes & Walcott Stand for his ultimately futile effort.That same stumps interview had seen Joseph detail his plan against Konstas, having noted a susceptibility to the ball nipping in when Australia last played India. It seemed too early in the series to reveal one’s notes, but the warning didn’t help Konstas. Entirely unsure of his second-innings approach, Konstas was beaten repeatedly by the ball moving away, and sporadically walked at the bowler to swish without effect. Five overs after the dropped catches, Joseph finally got his kid, avoiding the need for catchers by cutting one back to bowl him off the edge. Konstas, despite attempting aggression, had made five runs from 38 balls and effectively been out three times to the same bowler along the way.Khawaja was gone by then, lbw for 15 to the other Joseph, Alzarri. Josh Inglis misjudged a leave to be bowled by Jayden Seales for 12. With a rust-coloured pitch still offering bounce from its increasingly scuffed surface, there has been a sense of the Barbados of old, with the hot breeze pushing towards the nearby beach as the West Indies pace trio worked in tandem, running in with the names of Malcolm Marshall or Joel Garner at their backs.View image in fullscreenJosh Hazlewood picks up the wicket of Brandon King.Photograph: Ricardo Mazalán/APAustralia’s quicks used the surface just as effectively until an early tea. Resuming at 57-4, Brandon King on debut made it to 26 before doing as Inglis would later do, shouldering arms to a ball that angled in to take off stump, Josh Hazlewood getting his second. Roston Chase and Shai Hope put on 67, the second-best partnership of the match so far, Chase as the new captain returning from two years out of contention, Hope re-embracing Test cricket after four years as a white-ball specialist.Pat Cummins got Chase lbw for 44, Beau Webster found movement at lower pace to have Justin Greaves caught behind for 4 before getting Hope the same way for 48, and while Alzarri Joseph hit Hazlewood for a towering six to put West Indies into the lead on his way to 23 not out, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon completed the share platter by polishing off the last two wickets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Green was given not out lbw due to an inside edge, even though the soundwave suggested that the ball might have brushed his front pad in line before reaching the bat. After Hope had a low catch ruled out as wicketkeeper the previous day, the catch from Hope’s bat was given despite Alex Carey landing with his glove on the ground first, when the ball might have made contact. Green was also spared by a surprising ball-tracking projection showing the ball soaring over.With quantities of rum being poured on the trucked-in sand of the party stand, the crowd responses to each close call got increasingly raucous, while the modest numbers of Caribbean voices in attendance were raised at televisions around the ground. They were louder when the reprieves failed to help Green, cutting at extra bounce from Greaves, and a slip catch finally held by Chase. Beau Webster and Travis Head finished unbeaten on 13 and 19 respectively, despite a fierce closing spell from Shamar Joseph that bruised Head’s hand. West Indies have gone hard at Australia this match without luck breaking their way. With the lead as it is, they may yet pull off a surprise if that luck turns on the third day.Explore more on these topicsAustralia cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Although he has played some of the best tennis of his life over the past few months, Draper’s preparation for Wimbledon has not been seamless. After being sidelined for a couple of days before last week’s ATP Tour event at Queen’s Club,he ended the tournamentsuffering from tonsillitis.Still, Draper competed extremely well in west London to reach the semi-finals and, with such a short amount of time to acclimatise to the grass, his four matches there will be invaluable to his hopes of making a deep run at Wimbledon. The 23-year-old said he was feeling much better now.“Just been on antibiotics, got over it,” said Draper. “I have been training. Had a couple of days off. Refreshed. I am not sure when I start – Monday or Tuesday – but by then I will be feeling great. I already feel so much better. Got my energy back, that’s for sure. Sometimes you don’t realise how bad you were at the time.”View image in fullscreenJack Draper will have to handle the pressure of increased expectations after swiftly climbing the world rankings.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAHaving started last year’s grass-court season as the world No 40, Draper has enjoyed a remarkable breakthrough year, reaching his first grand slam semi-final at the US Open last year andwinning his first Masters 1000 titleat Indian Wells in March. That success, however, also means dealing with the pressure of following in Andy Murray’s footsteps and being a genuine contender at his home grand slam.“I’m normal, I’m like anyone,” he said. “If anyone asks you how you are going to deal with the pressure, you’re going to think: ‘I can’t control that.’ I focus on what I can control. I can’t control what people say, what noise people say, what hype there is, what criticism, all I can do is try my hardest and focus everyday on what I’m going to do to prepare and play my best tennis in order to try to win the matches.“So I’m really excited to go out there to compete. Full of excitement knowing the crowd is right behind me, that I’m going to be playing on the courts that I wanted to play on since I was young, watching Murray, watching all these great players perform out there and it feels amazing to know that. It’s sinking in that I’m there now and so I’ve got the chance to show people what I can do and I’m really looking forward to seeing what I can do.”Explore more on these topicsJack DraperWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

More than half the starting XV, three of the bench reserves, the newly minted captain, Dan Sheehan, and the head coach,Andy Farrell, reside in Ireland but perhaps the latter’s most striking selection is the squad’s uncut ­English diamond at No 8.Henry Pollock is only 20 but the young back-row has been handed the glittering prize of a lifetime against Western Force on Saturday. Go well and Farrell may well include him in his Test match plans next month. Should the Northampton forward endure a problematic night, ­conversely, it may precipitate an abrupt ­managerial U-turn.‘Ellis Genge? You go from despising people to having coffee’: Dan Sheehan on Lions magicRead moreJudging by the tone of Farrell’s early assessment of Pollock’s value, though, there is already a sense among the coaching staff that their squad’s youngest member is something special despite a slightly mixed first forayoff the bench against Argentinain Dublin last Friday. “You can see he’s got a real point of difference,” said the head coach. “He’s certainly not overawed. I mean, I love that. You want them kids to be themselves.”Having captained Great Britain at rugby league himself at the age of 21, Farrell knows more than most about precocious youth and clearly does not regard Pollock as either a callow apprentice along for the ride or “a pest” on the training field, as one or two of his England teammates have good-humouredly described him. “He’s not been a pest, definitely not. He’s been great and he’s hungry to make a difference the whole time.“You don’t want a kid to go under the radar and in three weeks’ time just settle into a side. You pick him for a reason. He’s a Lion just like the eldest player, there’s no difference ­whatsoever. His character is ­infectious to everyone.”The not-so-subliminal message is that the Lions need a catalyst to help crank up the tempo against the Force after their pre-departure loss to the Pumas. This time they have the benefit of being able to pick from their extensive Leinster contingent and Finn Russell, having just helpedBath clinch a Premiership title, is also around to pull the tactical strings at fly-half outside Tomos Williams, the Gloucester and Wales scrum-half.View image in fullscreenDan Sheehan will captain the British & Irish Lions against Western Force.Photograph: Dan Sheridan/Inpho/ShutterstockThe only players picked to start for a second successive game are Tadhg Beirne and Sione Tuipulotu but both will wear different numbers this time in a side containing no fewer than nine first-time Lions, Sheehan among them. The challenge for all concerned, however, is essentially the same: to display greater certainty and cohesion than they did at vital moments against Argentina.Within that collective template Farrell has also made clear he wants individuals to stand up and demonstrate why he picked them in the first place. In Pollock’s case that means taking the game to the opposition with and without the ball and being in areas that defences might not expect. “His point of difference is his ability to see things quickly and act upon that,” Farrell said. “His line running, for example, is pretty good. His awareness of space, how sharp he is in his mind and his athletic abilities are also up there with the other lads in the squad.”Among the rest of the Lions there is also a belief that Pollock’s bouncing energy is already emerging as a force for good. “He’s a great fella, he really is,” said the wing Mack Hansen. “People say he does things for the camera and all that but I think that’s just him. He just loves it. He’s living his dream and he’s like: ‘How good is this?’ So I don’t think it’s fake by any means.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Lions are still without Jamison Gibson-Park, Hugo Keenan and James Ryan, all of whom should be available to face the Reds on Wednesday, but Sheehan wants those involved this weekend to go out and match the Force for intensity and desire. “I don’t want them to think that they’re going to be hungrier than us,” said the Leinster hooker.Even against a Force side without the injured Kurtley Beale – replaced at full-back by Ben Donaldson – it should all make for an intriguing occasion. “Part of the whole package is dealing with the pressure we put on ourselves,” said Farrell, understandably keen to see more collective composure in multiple areas. “That’s why we were disappointed last week. I put a lot on them because I want to see how they deal with the pressure. We’ll see on Saturday how we respond. I hate losing, so does everyone else.”Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsLions tour 2025Andy FarrellSuper Rugby PacificRugby unionAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

He also broke the Duke supervillain stereotypeRead moreWhen Dallas overcame long oddsin this year’s draft lottery to win the No 1 overall pick, there was no doubt they would go on to pick the 18-year-old from Maine. It is a move that may go some way to soothing the Mavs fanbase, who erupted in angerwhen the team traded superstar Luke Dončićto the Los Angeles Lakers in February.The 6ft 8in Flagg helped guide Duke to an NCAA Final Four appearance after averaging 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.4 blocks as a freshman. He won the Wooden Award as the nation’s best college player along with taking home other honors including ACC Rookie of the Year and ACC All-Defensive Team.The Mavericks had the No 1 overall pick for the second time in franchise history. They also had the top selection in 1981, when they drafted Mark Aguirre out of DePaul.The San Antonio Spurs picked Rutgers point guard Dylan Harper with the second overall pick. Harper, son of five-timeNBAchampion Ron Harper, will play alongside French phenom Victor Wembanyama on a Spurs team that are starting to look like they could become a force in the Western Conference again after a few downs years.The 76ers then took Baylor’s VJ Edgecombe, getting the first sustained burst of loud cheers of the draft from what seemed to be a number of Philadelphia fans who made the trip to Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The first two picks had long been expected, but the No 3 spot was the first one where there was intrigue.Kon Knueppel made it two Duke players in the first four picks when the Charlotte Hornets took him at No 4. Ace Bailey, who could have been in the mix to go third but declined to work out for the 76ers, ended up going at No 5 to Utah.First-round NBA draft picks for 20251)Dallas Mavericks– Cooper Flagg, forward, DukeScouting report:Only the fourth freshman named Associated Press men’s national player of the year. Led Final Four team in scoring (19.2), rebounding (7.5), assists (4.2), steals (1.4) and blocks (1.4). Shot 38.5% on 3-pointers and 84% on free throws. Ranked in 85th percentile or better in converting as the ballhandler in pick-and-rolls, post-ups and transition, according to Synergy’s analytics rankings. Set Atlantic Coast Conference freshman record with 42 points against Notre Dame. Turns 19 in December.2) San Antonio Spurs – Dylan Harper, guard, RutgersScouting report:Freshman lefty who thrived as scorer (19.4) and lead ballhandler with two-way potential. Notably scored 36 points against Notre Dame, then 37 a day later against then-No 9 Alabama in November. Averaged 4.0 assists and 1.4 steals. Son of former NBA guard Ron Harper. Couldn’t lift Rutgers to a winning record despite playing with fellow top prospect Ace Bailey.

As a consequence Meta’s use of their work was judged a “fair use” – a legal doctrine that allows use of copyright protected work without permission – and no copyright liability applied.However, the ruling offered hope for American creative professionals who argue that training AI models on their work without permission is illegal.Chhabria said using copyrighted work without permission to train large language models – the core technology behind chatbots like ChatGPT – would be unlawful in “many circumstances”, splitting with another federal judge in San Francisco who found on Monday in a separate lawsuit that Anthropic’s AI training made “fair use” of copyrighted materials.Chhabria also indicated the creative industries could launch further suits.“This ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta’s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,” he wrote.Chhabria dismissed as “nonsense” Meta’s claim that the public interest would be “badly disserved” if AI developers were blocked from using copyright-protected works freely.In his conclusion, Chhabria expressed sympathy for the argument that LLMs take authors’ work and then turn it against them.He wrote: “No matter how transformative LLM training may be, it’s hard to imagine that it can be fair use to use copyrighted books to develop a tool to make billions or trillions of dollars while enabling the creation of a potentially endless stream of competing works that could significantly harm the market for those books.”The doctrine of fair use allows the use of copyrighted works without the copyright owner’s permission in some circumstances and is a key defence for the tech companies.“This ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta’s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,” Chhabria said. “It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.”Anthropic also faces a further trial this year after the judge in its case ruled that its copying and storage of more than 7m pirated books in a central library infringed the authors’ copyrights and was not fair use.A spokesperson for the Meta case authors’ law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, said that it disagreed with the judge’s decision to rule for Meta despite the “undisputed record” of the company’s “historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Much of that data has included copyright-protected works.The lawsuit is one of several copyright cases brought by writers, news outlets and other copyright owners against companies including OpenAI, Microsoft and Anthropic over their AI training.AI companies argue their systems make fair use of copyrighted material by studying it to learn to create new, transformative content, and that being forced to pay copyright holders for their work could hamstring the growing AI industry.Copyright owners say AI companies unlawfully copy their work to generate competing content that threatens their livelihoods. Chhabria expressed sympathy for that argument during a hearing in May, which he reiterated on Wednesday.The judge said generative AI had the potential to flood the market with endless images, songs, articles and books using a tiny fraction of the time and creativity that would otherwise be required to create them.“So by training generative AI models with copyrighted works, companies are creating something that often will dramatically undermine the market for those works, and thus dramatically undermine the incentive for human beings to create things the old-fashioned way,” Chhabria said.Explore more on these topicsMetaArtificial intelligence (AI)FacebookMark ZuckerbergTechnology sectorIntellectual propertynewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what you need to knowThe video platform previously had a carve out in the November draft legislation but the online safety regulator has recommended it be included in the banAustralia news live: latest politics updatesGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastJosh TaylorTechnology reporterWed 25 Jun 2025 23.06 EDTFirst published on Tue 24 Jun 2025 11.00 EDTShareAustralia’s online safety regulator has recommendedYouTubenot be exempt from the under-16s social media ban, saying the video-streaming platform can expose children to harmful content.But YouTube has said the government should stick by its draft rules which give the platform a carve-out.What are the arguments for and against regulating YouTube – and what will it mean for kids watching YouTube if it’s banned?Why was the government considering exempting YouTube in the first place?When the legislation to ban children under-16 from accessing social media was introducedin the federal parliament in November last year, the then communications minister Michelle Rowland said the government intended to exempt YouTube.That was because YouTube had “a significant purpose to enable young people to get the education and health support they would need”.1:19Australia’s social media ban for under-16s is now law. There’s plenty we still don’t know – videoThe exemption cameless than 48 hours after direct lobbying of the ministerby YouTube’s global CEO, Guardian Australia revealed in April.The move surprised YouTube’s rivals – Meta, TikTok and Snapchat – with TikTok arguing it was a “sweetheart deal”. YouTube offers a vertical video product similar to Reels on Instagram and TikTok, and its competitors believed the site should therefore be included.Why did the eSafety commissioner recommend including YouTube in the ban?As part of the development on the rules around which platforms the social media ban applies to, the minister must consult with the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailInadvice to the new minister, Anika Wells, released on Monday, Inman Grant said the regulator’s recent youth survey found 76% of 10 to 15-year-olds had used YouTube. The survey found 37% of those children who had seen or heard potentially harmful content online had found it on YouTube.She also pointed to Black Dog Institute finding that higher daily hours spent on YouTube is associated with greater symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia.“YouTube currently employs persuasive design features and functionality that may be associated with harms to health, including those which may contribute to unwanted or excessive use (such as infinite scroll, autoplay, qualitative social metrics and tailored and algorithmically recommended content feeds),” Inman Grant said.“Separately and combined, these features may encourage excessive consumption without breaks and amplify exposure to harmful content.”Inman Grant said there was not sufficient evidence that YouTube predominantly provides beneficial experiences for children under 16.The advice noted, however, that children would still be able to watch videos on YouTube if they were logged out as the legislation is limited to preventing children from having accounts.What does YouTube say?Ina statementreleased after Inman Grant’s advice was released, YouTube’s Australia and New Zealand senior manager for public policy, Rachel Lord, said the legislation was considered and agreed to by the parliament on the understanding YouTube would be exempt and the advice “goes against the government’s commitment” as well as research on community sentiment that there is “broad agreement that YouTube is suitable for younger users”.YouTube said it has been building age-appropriate products for more than a decade and in the first quarter of 2025, the company removed 192,856 videos for violating its hateful or abusive policies, up 22% year-on-year.The company argued it is fundamentally a video distribution and hosting platform – not one to primarily facilitate social interaction. YouTube argued an August survey of Australian teachers found 84% use YouTube on at least a monthly basis to help students learn.YouTube said eSafety and potentially the communications minister might be seeking to change the position on exemption following pressure tactics from YouTube’s rivals.But what about YouTube Kids?YouTube has argued it has a specific age-appropriate platform called Kids which disables the ability for users under the age of consent from uploading content or writing comments.The company has not specifically sought a carve-out just for its Kids product.When Inman Grant was asked about YouTube Kids at the National Press Club on Tuesday, she said that platforms considered low-risk, designed with a child in mind and with ample safety features could be excluded from the ban, but she “can’t answer definitively until I see the rules”.Could kids just watch YouTube without logging into an account?Yes. Inman Grant said if a teacher in a school wants to show a video to school kids, they can access YouTube without logging in.She said YouTube had “mastered those opaque algorithms driving users down rabbit holes they’re powerless to fight against” and accessing the site logged out would “harness the positives” and allow people to engage without the technologies designed to make social media addictive.In a follow up response on Thursday to YouTube’s claims the platform needed to be excluded from the ban to “ensure young Australians can continue to access enriching content on YouTube”, Inman Grant said her advice would not mean that children would no longer be able to access educational content on YouTube.“The new law will only restrict children under the age of 16 from having their own accounts – not accessing content on YouTube or any other service through links from the school or in a ‘logged-out’ state,” she said.“There is nothing in the legislation that prevents educators with their own accounts from continuing to incorporate school-approved educational content on YouTube or any other service just as they do now.”What happens next?The minister will finalise the rules and decide which platforms the ban will apply to in the coming months.The trial on age assurance technology is expected toreport to the minister by the end of July, which will determine which technologies the platforms must use to keep under-16s off their services.The government has said the ban will come into effect in early December.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsSocial mediaYouTubeDigital mediaLaw (Australia)explainersShareReuse this content"

Turn to nine o’clock at the bottom of the stairs. You have arrived at row five.”Ahmed was one of the first people to try new wayfinding technology installed this week at Lord’s to help blind, partially sighted and disabled fans to better access live sports.Waymap, the company behind the app-based navigation tool, claims the 31,000-capacity cricket stadium is the world’s first sports arena to be fitted with a personal GPS that aims to offer a fine-grain version of traffic satnavs for stadiums, shopping centres and transport networks.New headsets bring Wimbledon to life for visually impaired fansRead moreWaymap used a £50,000 camera to scan every staircase, walkway, slope, doorway and concourse to create a digital twin of the historic cricket ground, allowing its app to guide people metre-by-metre to their destination.It has been installed in advance of next month’s England v India Test match. The Marylebone cricket club, which runs Lord’s, believes it could also help other cricket fans find the most accessible routes around the complex.“The idea is amazing for blind people,” said Ahmed, who tested the app at the Guardian’s request after playing in an exhibition match on Wednesday. “If it works 100% properly, I can come to the train station myself, I can cross the road myself and I can come to the stadium and find my way with the app. I know so many people who are into sports but don’t go. This would push the door completely open for them.”View image in fullscreenMoshfique Ahmed at Lord’s cricket ground.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianIt was the first time he had used the app and there were a couple of false starts – it briefly suggested he head in the wrong direction and once directed him towards a staircase that was temporarily closed. It also stopped him at row 20 of the Edrich stand instead of row 5 as instructed.But the problems appeared to be as much down to the app and the user getting used to each other. For example, the app needs to be calibrated to the individual user’s stride pattern, which explained why it had directed him to the wrong row.Blind people excluded from benefits of AI, says charityRead more“It needs to be accurate and trustworthy,” said Ahmed, who lost most of his sight in 2017.Celso Zuccollo, the chief executive of Waymap, said: “Waymap is a new way of navigating. It usually takes a few walks for new users to learn how to use the app most effectively – and for it to learn your walking style. The more you use it, the better it gets.“The goal would be [to extend it to places like] Wembley, football stadiums and cricket stadiums, and we’re in talks with horse racing tracks,” he said, adding that property managers could update the maps in real time if food trucks were positioned in different areas or certain pathways were closed.The app, which is already available for users of the public transit system in Washington DC, does not alert the partially sighted user to the movements of other members of the public, particularly those wandering around looking at their phones, whom Ahmed said were still the biggest obstacle to him getting around safely and comfortably.Explore more on these topicsBlindness and visual impairmentDisabilityCricketAppsnewsShareReuse this content"

Every day brings atorrent of unimaginable horror. It used to be weeks between disasters, now we’re lucky to get hours.For many, the only sane solution is to stop reading the news altogether – advice often shared by therapists, self-help books andeven newspaper articles.But to bury your head in the sand untilthe day the apocalypse arrivesat your doorstep is not necessarily the most tranquil, nor moral, of postures. In the sprawling Reddit communityr/collapse, people instead try to stare unblinkingly at the unravelling of civilization. For the roughly half a million members here, many of whom joined in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic and two Donald Trump inaugurations, the arc of history feels more like a freefall.This June, r/collapse was busy discussing the developing conflict between Iran and Israel, as well as“wet bulbs”(a far more humid and deadly type of heatwave), themillions of air conditionersbeing bought in India as temperatures rise andTrump’s plan to end Fema.Almost half of the members, when asked when they think collapse is going to happen, said that it’s already happeningAnonymous r/collapse moderatorBut one of thetop poststackled a more specialist topic: declining levels of phytoplankton in the North Atlantic. “As if the North Atlantic fisheries wasn’t in bad enough shape from overfishing of cod, now the base of the entire food chain has observed to be getting smaller each year for the past 60 years,” the poster wrote. A commenter added: “Ocean acidification/die off is terrifying. Even if we solve all the other collapse problems (and we almost certainly can’t) the oceans dying means the atmosphere becomes depleted of oxygen and poisonous. If humans survive those scenarios, life on Earth would more resemble that of a moon colony.” Much informed panicking ensued.There are lots of places on the internet, and especially onReddit, that collate news stories around a theme: r/UpliftingNews, r/LateStageCapitalism and r/nottheonion (which posts news so ridiculous it seems like satire) to name a few. But r/collapse is much more than a collation of links for people to feel outraged and nihilistic or warm and fuzzy about. What’s striking is the clear-eyed, unemotional tone in which posts are written: neither pessimistic nor hopeful, just peering through the window at a relentless decline.“We are not an activist subreddit,” one moderator, a retired history teacher, told me. “We filter out people who want to organize and protest. We are also not inclined towardsaccelerationism, we’re not seeking doom. We accept that perhaps it’s going to happen, but it’s not a conspiratorial subreddit. It’s basically logic, rational and scientific.”View image in fullscreenFirefighters work to put out wildfire in Tryon, North Carolina, on 3 March 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThat is thanks in part to r/collapse’s 30 fairly active moderators – among them neuroscientists, environmental scientists, chemical engineers, government auditors and history teachers – who intensively maintain the subreddit as relatively objective a resource as possible. They even have a separate page, called r/collapse_wilds, for posts removed by the moderation team, usually because they did not provide high quality enough evidence. When a new moderator applies, the existing group screens them for mental health issues and ability to handle consistently distressing content, as well as overt political bias.It might sound like a lot of red tape to help run a subreddit, but when you realize what it takes to drench yourself in fatalistic topics day in, day out, you start to understand that a collapse moderator is a special kind of person.I spoke with 10 such moderators on a video chat, just as the national guard and marines were sent to quell Ice protests in Los Angeles. All are men based in North America, polite and turn-taking, though most insisted on remaining anonymous so their online roles wouldn’t interfere with their real world positions. In their roles, they take theexistential questionsof civilization collapse seriously: What exactly constitutes collapse? Are we already experiencing it? Why aren’t people reacting more strongly to its likelihood, and does either humanity or technology have the ability to prevent it? Practical questions, too: where is the best place to live, the most helpful job to have, as collapse happens?The disaster preppers who were proven right: ‘We lived in the car for five days’Read moreThey wrestle with whether too much Trump news is distracting, and painstakingly debate posts about themorality of having childrenand population growth, which they say is the most controversial topic among the community. Each post from a user must come with an accompanying statement explaining why it’s related to collapse that the moderators assess; sometimes it seems more like they’re overseeing a grant application process rather than an online forum.The work is often philosophical in nature. “People say that this is one of the least religious times in human history, but I think that’s completely false,” said Etienne, a moderator who is based in Ontario with a background in cognitive science and neuroscience. “Most of us have strong, strong faith in the myth of technological progress. Most people associate thinking about collapse with pessimism because you’re questioning the orthodoxy of our modern religion, which is faith in progress. And I think once you’ve made peace with the myth that we all grew up with being scientifically false, then you go through the stages of grief, then you build some psychological resilience to live in the world.”The group says that when the media or academia write about collapse issues, they often try to end on an optimistic note, so as not to depress the reader.“It’s really hard to find a mainstream publication that doesn’t end an article about, say, renewable energy, with a section that says: ‘things are difficult but let’s have hope’ and ‘it’s just a matter of building more solar panels,’” Etienne said. He cited reports, including an impactfulstudyby Simon Michaux commissioned by the Finnish government, that say it’s simply impossible to replace energy with renewable sources at scale. “But we find there’s much less coverage of that – of using less energy and degrowth.”View image in fullscreenPeople shop for air coolers amid hot weather conditions in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India, on 20 June 2025.Photograph: Nasir Kachroo/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe moderators also say that people who are concerned about societal collapse tend to think it’ll come suddenly with a nuclear bomb or terrible pandemic. The subreddit is of a different mind. One moderator, an engineer who preferred to remain anonymous, explained the tenets of r/collapse like this: “In the long term, it’s going to be very difficult for us to maintain this very complex industrial society. We’re looking at a type of simplification of industrial civilization. I think most of our members think this is what collapse is, which is why almost half of the members, when asked when they think collapse is going to happen, said that it’s already happening.“This is the idea of catabolic collapse: that what we’re living through is a series of crises, sometimes followed by momentary resolution, but the long-term trend is downturn. It’s not going to be a sudden event that’s everything in a single day, which I think people likepreppersare more accustomed to thinking.”Every week, r/collapse puts out a special newsletter called Last Week in Collapse, a one-stop shop for everything that has gone wrong in the world. Its author is an international affairs researcher, who requested anonymity because their background might “color the reader’s interpretation of the events”. They’re not part of the moderation group, but began writing the roundup in 2021, inspired by what they had seen on the subreddit.“It was part of a process of making sense of the storm of news around us – almost a form of writing therapy,” they told me over email. “It is so easy to get lost or distracted by the next thing that we forget the big picture. So I decided to start organizing and summarizing other stories because I believed it would help other collapsologists and observers zoom out and take it all in.”It makes for a pretty brutal read.This week’s newsletter, for example, began with a newly publishedstudyof tree rings that suggested “irreversible large-scale forest loss” in the Amazon; featured a study saying climate change could reduce crop yields across the US and Europe 40% by 2100, which one scientistlikenedto “everyone on the planet giving up breakfast”; touched on counterintuitiveresearchshowing that some glass bottles contain up to 50 times more microplastics than plastic bottles or metal cans; and reported that this is “the sixth consecutive year that global peacefulness has deteriorated” per theGlobal Peace Index. These were just a few of around a hundred links.To paraphrase Trotsky: you may not be interested in collapse, but collapse is interested in youLast Week in Collapse author“Collapse is hard to deny when it’s all laid out for you every week,” says the author. Readers are now able to spend just five or 10 minutes reading one email “and be kept abreast on all the latest doom”.I ask what differentiates just bad news from a news story that is actually about collapse. “I have found that it helps to imagine likely realities for humanity, position your perspective in the future, and then look backwards for the telltale signs and milestones of future collapse,” the author says. “What factors and events will seem obvious to someone living 50 or 100 years from now? We can look back at the 1930s today and the road to WWII seems much clearer. Scientists are publishing under-appreciated studies every day, and their relevance is fairly obvious. Yet our attention lies elsewhere entirely.”A weekly roundup does seem like a useful alternative to completely ignoring society’s downfall. But if things are as bad as r/collapse believes them to be, does it do us any good to inundate ourselves with news of the end of everything? Aren’t we just increasing our personal suffering without making anything better?“Yes, I sometimes wonder about the overall mental impact of Last Week in Collapse,” says its author. “I know some people find it to be valuable, informative and even soothing. Others can’t bring themselves to read it. It’s not for everyone, and that’s fine. To paraphrase Trotsky: you may not be interested in collapse, but collapse is interested in you.”View image in fullscreenA diver swims in the Marmara Sea near Turkey, to inspect mucilage, a layer of slime that develops on the surface of the water due to the proliferation of phytoplankton, gravely threatening the marine biome, on 8 June 2021.Photograph: Yasin Akgül/AFP/Getty ImagesTo that end, the subreddit provides online mental health resources as well as a separate community,r/CollapseSupport, where people talk about their struggles. “Can’t stop thinking about the children”, “feeling completely hopeless” and “scared to death for everyone” are three recent post titles.Most of the moderators say that the thing they’ve found most helpful in dealing with the onslaught of information is moderating itself, and connecting with people who have similar concerns across the world: debating but also sharing cat photos and having meaningful discussion about how to lead a meaningful life in the end times. But they’re aware they’re not always the most fun people at a party.“I don’t want to be right about this sort of situation,” said one of the moderators, an electrical engineer from the midwest. “But if you’re open-minded and you’re considerate of sources, and you’re approaching it from a very methodical fashion, there is much cause for concern. Working through that grief was trying. I think there’s a lot of people that come to this community that maybe had my same perspective, and if I can at least help a few of those folks work through that, or come to their own peace, that adds some small iota of value to the internet space at large.”And that would be a vaguely uplifting note to end this article on, but as I’m hearing, that’s the coward’s way out. The truth is not all the people behind r/collapse feel like they’re necessarily helping.As the author of Last Week in Collapse put it to me, there’s probably no way out of the collapse: “I do not believe we will ultimately innovate or vote ourselves out of our situation. I predict humanity is in for a polluted future of climate emergencies, famines, wars and scarcity before the end of this century. And heatwaves, civil conflicts, breakdown of ocean currents, disease, poverty, overpopulation, drought and more. So I feel a certain sense of duty to inform those who are interested, but it’s probably healthier to ‘chop wood, carry water’ than to spend too much time following the world’s problems. Most people can’t really stop the machine anyway.”Explore more on these topicsRedditThe Armageddon complexSocial mediaClimate crisisUS politicsAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The response was a surprise for the developer. The game looks interesting, people wrote in the comments, but was “ruined” by AI art. But the game’s cover art, used as the thumbnail for the YouTube video, was in fact made by a real person,according to developer Lana Ro. “We know the artist, we’ve seen her work, so such a negative reaction was unexpected for us, and at first we didn’t know how to respond or how to feel,” Ro said. “We were confused.”It’s not wrong for people to be worried about AI use in video games – in fact, it’s good to be sceptical, and ensure that the media you support aligns with your values. Common arguments against generative AI relate to environmental impact, art theft and just general quality, and video game developers are grappling with how generative AI will impact their jobs. But the unexpected problem is that the backlash against generative AI is now hurting even those whodon’tuse it. “I would rather people be overly cautious than not,” veteran game developer andChessplusdigital directorJosh Caratellisaid. “But being collateral damage does suck.”Caratelli and his game Chessplus were caught up in a similar situation when heposted some art to Reddit– sharing explicitly that it was commissioned andnotmade with AI. Even then, Caratelli said he’s received several comments and direct messages accusing him of lying about it, or suggesting he’d been duped. “It’s very clearly hand drawn,” he said. “It was a fair whack of money to spend for an indie team on a piece of art. We thought it was worth it.”View image in fullscreenDarth Vader as he appears in Epic Games' Fortnite, which recreates actor James Earl Jones’ voice using conversational AIPhotograph: Epic Games/Disney/LucasfilmIt’s becoming increasingly common for people to call out instances where a game seems to have used AI in a way that replaces human work. (Epic Games was singled outrecently for its AI Darth Vader.) But sometimes, that anger is misdirected at people and companies that are simplybelievedto be using AI.This is what happened when a Magic: The Gathering artist was accusedof using AI, forcing Wizards of the Coast to put out a statement on the false accusations. Even Nintendo was accused, in May, of using AI-generated images for in-game billboards in Mario Kart World.Nintendo put out a statementto deny the claims.Bigger companies such as Wizards of the Coast and Nintendo may be able to weather false accusations, but indie studios with less influence may have a harder time. Little Droid, released in April, stars a little robot navigating a lush pixel-art world. Its cover, on the other hand, renders the droid in a totally different style – with the smooth, glossy finish that people have come to expect from AI art generation tools. People in the YouTube comments pointed to specific details to “prove” the art is AI-generated: the robot itself is asymmetrical, because AI has issues with symmetry; the glow or lighting look off; some naysayers simply argued that real people don’t draw like that. Stamina Zero, in the comments, continued to hold its ground – that no AI was used in development of the game or its art.Then the studio posted a video it said proves it, showing several steps in the art’s process. The video showed early art concepts, navigating different layers in Adobe Photoshop as a way to demonstrate how the art came together. “We contacted the artist and asked her for all the available intermediate sketches and the source PSD with all the layers,” Ro said. “Based on all the available files, we put together a video as quickly as possible and posted it … It was a damage control move – a way to calm things down and make the discussion more productive. We had nothing to hide and were ready to be transparent.”Some people relented, accepting the video as proof that AI was not used. Others were unconvinced. There’s no actual drawing in the video, which would be impossible to share unless the artist was recording their entire process. That is something some artists do already – but it creates additional work for them. And, as Stamina Zero found out, there will always be people who still don’t believe.The trailer for Stamina Zero’s Little Droid“To be honest, I don’t have a clear strategy for how we will proceed in the future,” Ro said. “There was advice on Reddit not to make art similar to the results of AI work, as this triggers people. And this tip could work. But AI learns from the work of artists and, in the future, it is quite possible that it will be able to replicate any style.”Caratelli shares the community’s ethical concerns about AI plagiarism, environmental impact and human creativity. But he was dispirited by the accusations against Chessplus. “It’s really hard for AI to make things with meaning. It’s a thousand little intricacies that make a game great … [That] work isn’t being valued,” he said. Ro agreed: “It’s completely unfair that so many people who have honed their craft for years are facing this and being wrongfully accused.”Both of these games are examples of how generative AI has poisoned the creative well, even for creators whoaren’tusing it. We can never be totally sure, now, whether we’re looking at something that a human made or not, as even proof can theoretically be fabricated. For creatives and players, it will have to come down to a relationship of trust.Explore more on these topicsGamesArtificial intelligence (AI)PlayStationnewsShareReuse this content"

The Democratic party could learn from himYousef MunayyerFew issues highlight how out of touch Democratic leaders are than the issue of Palestine – Mamdani chose a different pathThu 26 Jun 2025 11.06 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 12.03 EDTShareAs the ballots were counted on Wednesday in the Democratic primary election for mayor in New York City, a young candidate with little national name recognition,Zohran Mamdani, stood atop a slate of candidates including the runner-up, and favorite, Andrew Cuomo.There are several reasons why Mamdani was able to pull off this remarkable victory, putting him on track to compete favorably in the mayoral election in November, and many of them have implications for elections outside New York City.But one area where the contrast between the candidates could not be clearer was on the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Mamdani, for his part, stood with protesters, demanded the release of Mahmoud Khalil, and called out Israel’s war crimes. Mamdani even pledged he’d have the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, an indicted war criminal,arrested if he came to New York City while he was mayor. Cuomo, on the other hand,volunteered to be part of Netanyahu’s legal defense teambefore the international criminal court.Israel’s genocide in Gaza has tanked already waning support for Israel in the US, particularly among Democrats. Polls show that for the first time,fewer than 50% of Americans have a favorable view of Israel. And while there is some movement among Republicans in this direction, the biggest driver of this trend is among independents and, especially, Democrats. Democrats sympathize with Palestinians over Israelis by a 3-to-1 margin. That is a massive gap and it also speaks to one of the most important ways a candidate’s politics on Gaza affects the way they are perceived by the electorate.Will the Democrats learn from Zohran Mamdani’s victory? | Bernie SandersRead moreDemocrats increasingly feel their party leaders are old and out of touch with where Democratic voters are. About 62% of Democrats saytheir party needs new leaders. Few issues highlight how out of touch with their party leaders are than the issue of Palestine. While opinion polls are clear and consistent about Democratic voters’ disgust with Israeli policies toward Palestinians, Democratic party leaders like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries are stalwart defenders of Israel. Increasingly, a candidate’s politics on Gaza is a litmus test for authenticity and whether the candidate actually cares to represent the voters. Cuomo was not interested in representing voters on this issue,he was content instead to accept major contributionsfrom billionaire backers of Donald Trump and Israel like Bill Ackman.Cuomo was the favorite in this race precisely because he had the name recognition and came from aNew Yorkpolitical dynasty. His father, Mario, was the governor of New York for three terms from 1983 to 1994 and Andrew was governor himself for a decade before resigning in disgrace in 2021 after numerous credible sexual assault allegations. If you were of voting age in New York, you associated the name Cuomo with political office.Cuomo probably thought that name recognition alone was enough to overcome any votes he’d lose from people who were angered by hisdisastrous decisionsduring the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic or hissexual assault scandalsas governor. This showed the total lack of effort in his campaign which seemed more geared for coronation than contestation. He failed to raise enough individual contributions togain public matching fundsand relied instead on big-money donors to fill his coffers throughPac contributions.Mamdani’s campaign was, almost in every possible way, the inverse of Cuomo’s. While Cuomo relied on billionaire backing, Mamdani raised the highest number of small-dollar contributions. While Cuomo’s campaign was barely noticeable in the streets of New York, Mamdani’s campaign knocked on one million doors. While Cuomo’s campaign message was muted and muddled, Mamdani’s was clear, bold and consistent.Mamdani’s projected primary election victory in New York also proved once again that voters will come out and vote in large numbers for candidates that they believe in even if their politics are characterized as well left of center. The conventional wisdom after Trump’s victory in 2024, especially in New York, was that the electoratehad shifted right. But that was never the case, mostly this was due to disaffected Democrats staying home because they were tired of what they saw as the same washed-up, inauthentic politics.Anyone can run for office financed by billionaire backers while spouting talking points produced by expensive consultants. But what Mamdani, Bernie Sanders and, yes, Trump figured out is that there is a huge and growing swath of the American electorate so disaffected by empty and corrupt politics that they are hungry for someone who feels authentic.Mamdani’s apparent victory is just the latest proof that forDemocratsespecially, if there is ever any doubt about a candidate’s authenticity, their politics on Palestine will be an easy way to separate the real ones from those just trying to fake it til they make it.Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniGazaNew YorkUS politicsDemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump managed tofly his B-2sall the way from Missouri without any help. No doubt it was a beautiful bombing. It hit the last target – the behemoth Fordow, deep in the mountains.Benjamin Netanyahu is congratulating himself too, for finally scratching his three-decade itch by striking Iran’s nuclear programme, and assassinating topIslamic Revolutionary Guards Corpscommanders. Most of all, Netanyahu managed to draw Trump, who had promised no more wars, into the fray. The hardline followers of the Islamic republic are also congratulating themselves on their successful strikes against Israel.The strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities brought fear of contamination throughout the week. Our social media were filled with an updated Iranian version of theduck-and-cover campaignfrom cold war America. In case of exposure to radiation, get inside, we were told, change your clothes, take a shower and tape the windows. Not a single siren has sounded: apparently, we don’t have them any more. Those who remember theIraq-Iran warsay there used to be sirens. Nor do we have shelters like Israelis do. Considering we have been at loggerheads with Israel for decades now, why haven’t they built some?For the past 12 days we have had a crash course in the sounds of war. The boom of a rocket hitting its target, the sharpratatatof the ground-to-air defence. You don’t see the missiles that blow up, but you see the red dots of the defences when they start at night.The first days were a blur. The big emotional freeze. The frenzy to gather documents and essentials for a speedy departure. The calculus of doom: how much water do I need? How many T-shirts should I pack? When should I leave? How far should I go? What is their scenario for us – Iraq or Afghanistan? Someone said Libya.I spent five years in Iran’s notorious Evin prison but when Israel bombed it I felt horror and fear | Nazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeRead moreWhen my VPN manages to connect me to X, the algorithm suggests a post by a man saying in Hebrew that there is no country called Iran. What?! He has coloured the map of Iran into segments. This is Turkmenistan, this is Balochistan, this is Azerbaijan, here in the south are the Arabs and in the middle are some Persians. How dare he? We are one of the oldest nations in the world. We didn’t invade this land – we are not recent immigrants. We are actuallyfromhere. We have survivedAlexander of Macedonia’s pyromania, we have survived Genghis Khan’s bloodbath and a brutal Arab invasion, and we are still here. We are the inheritors of the great poets Ferdowsi, Rumi andHafez, who give us our shared identity even though we speak many languages. I am sure I was not the only Iranian finding solace in Hafez this past week.Now that we have had a moment to breathe, the interminable question of these past few days, “what will happen now?”, is about the long term.Over the past 46 years Iranians have eroded the strictideology that was imposedon them in order to live a modern life. We have been hoping since 2015 and the signing of the joint comprehensive plan of action for the lifting of sanctions so we could reconnect to the world and fix our corrupted economy. Trump F-worded that chance. Our young people have stood up to the repressive rules that governed their personal lives; some died for it. Now, thanks to Israel and its benevolent bombs, the extreme sections of society, the ideologues who were marginalised, will be newly invigorated by conflict.We are a country at war now. The streets are full of checkpoints. I passed several driving in Tehran the other night. They are courteous now, but we recognise them from the days of protest. Will the Islamic republic forget these past 12 days? Can Netanyahu be contained by Trump? Will Israel andIranbecome friends now?It’s time for America to remember how dangerous regime change is | Christopher ChivvisRead moreWe are preparing for a wake in my family. We buried my stepmother in the cemetery south of Tehran three days ago. The road to the cemetery, usually packed with traffic, was almost empty. Tehran empty of its unbearable traffic and noise is suddenly so beautiful. I have never loved this city as much as I do now. The road to the cemetery will now be the route so many families will take to bury their dead. Along the way, I wonder how many Palestinians were killed while the eyes of the world were on us.We have had an exceptionally long and sublime spring in Tehran this year. The geraniums on my porch are still in bloom. It looks like the persimmon tree will have more fruit than any other year. If the relief holds, the questions that kept popping up during the attacks and were waved aside as pointless in an existential crisis will loom large. And the main one will be: what did this madness achieve for the people of Iran, Israel or the US?

To bend reality to your own worldview. To live almost entirely in the present. Where contradicting yourself is not a problem because two opposing statements can both be true. On the way toNatoyou can question article 5. On the way back you can give all the other Nato leaders a patronising pat on the head. And everyone is grateful for it.There again it also helps if you are the most powerful man in the world.Donald Trumpis not just tolerated, he is actively indulged. Prime ministers from other countries go out of their way to compete with one another in outright sycophancy. Flattery that started off as contrived now sounds dangerously sincere. Almost as if they genuinely believe it. Thank you Agent Orange for all you have done. We don’t know where we would be without you.And The Donald just laps it up. Feeds on it. At the recent Nato summit he looked like a pig in shit. Living his best life. Whatever sunbed regime he’s on, it’s working for him. If he lost any sleep over his decision to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities, it doesn’t show. Just repeat after Donald:The mission was a complete and utter successand Iran’s programme has been put back decades. If the Pentagon says otherwise, it’s just fake news. Yet again, reality can be what you want it to be.Even when Trump temporarily loses it, he wins. Swearing is generally a no-no for any leader. A sign that you’ve lost control. But when Donaldsaid Israel and Iran didn’t know what the fuck they were doing, he came out of it smelling of roses. Praised for his authenticity. Applauded for saying what the rest of the world is thinking. The Donald can do no wrong. He looks relaxed. God stand up for narcissists.Keir Starmer is no narcissist. And breathe a sigh of relief for that. The UK tried the narcissist route with Boris Johnson and that didn’t end well. Maybe we just aren’t a powerful enough country to get away with a sociopath in charge. Or, heaven forbid, maybe it was a matter of timing. Boris was the right man at the wrong time. That’s a horrible thought. Most of us would quite happily settle for a period of fairly boring politics. Where the government is serving the country rather than the ego of the person in charge. Where even when they are getting things wrong, they are at least trying to do the right thing.But that level of decency comes with a cost. Your psyche does not reward itself with a free pass. You worry about the consequences of your actions. Your toadying to The Donald. You worry about the people dying in Ukraine, Gaza, Israel and Iran. You worry when your domestic policieslook like they are falling apart. Wish you had spent more time reassuring backbenchers. Had explained better the trade-offs you were making. Had not been so quick to take a quick cash-saving win by removing benefits from people who can’t wash themselves before going to work.Keir has tried to keep a lid on all this as leaders always do. Pretend that he’s fully in charge of the situation. That everything is going according to plan. But always the tell-tale signs leak out. Starmer’s eyes betray him. They have a deadness to them, the life squeezed out. His face pasty and pallid. A man desperate for a breather, a moment to relax away from the treadmill.Yet always there is one thing more. Another summit, another speech, another bilat, another crisis at home. This wasn’t how he imagined his first year in Downing Street. The pressure and the pace is relentless. The treadmill going ever faster and there’s no getting off. He aches in the places where he used to play.Just hours after returning from The Hague, Keir was giving a keynote speech to the British Chambers of Commerce. It was one that he and they will quickly forget. A routine, box-ticking affair. An annual date, along with the CBI, in any prime minister’s diary. It wasn’t meant to be this way, mind. Starmer knows better than anyone that Labour has to work twice as hard to show that it is the party of business. But this time he couldn’t fake it to make it. He’s no visionary. He can’t access people’s hearts. Only their reason. And that only intermittently.Keir began by thanking the BCC for all it had done for the country. He knew it had been a tough year and he had asked a lot of business, but the good times were round the corner. Possibly. There was the new infrastructure strategy. Now there was also a new trade strategy which sounded very much like the old one. Which was to keep on doing the trade deals we can, as with the partial deals with the EU, US and India, and try to do some new smaller deals with other nations. The applause from the audience was barely audible. They didn’t sound desperately impressed. They can tell when a speaker is out on his feet and is phoning it in.Just over an hour later and Starmer was in the Commons for a statement on the G7 and Nato summits. Here he was much more like his chipper self. Not so much in his opening remarks about how the west was making a dangerous world safer, but in his reply toKemi Badenoch.The Tory leader just gets worse and worse. Half-witted, sulky and tone deaf. Kemikaze seemed to think the UK should no longer bother to send its prime minister to these international meetings. That Keir had only gone for the craic and to avoid her at prime minister’s questions. As if. Facing Kemi over the dispatch box was his half an hour of R&R in the week.Starmer dismissed her with barely concealed contempt as neither serious nor credible. An am-dram politician. Even the Tories were aghast. Mark Pritchard openly criticised his leader. He spoke for many on his own benches.Kemi had achieved the seemingly impossible. She had revivified a tired prime minister and united both Labour and opposition MPs against her. There is only one politician who looks a genuine leader in the Commons and it is still Starmer. He may have his hands full with a rebellion over the welfare bill, but as long as Kemi remains the leader of the opposition, he has nothing to fear from the Tories.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe politics sketchNatoKeir StarmerKemi BadenochUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Israeli leaders are openly in favor. If the US goes down this road, it will not be for the first time.In the last 80 years, Washington has overthrown many regimes. For a superpower, toppling foreign governments is not so hard to do. Getting the outcome you want is. This makes regime change as dangerous as it is seductive, as past US attempts clearly show.The US overthrow of the Japanese and German governments in the second world war made a whole generation of American leaders too optimistic about regime change. Germany’s and Japan’s transformation into strong democratic allies was a source of inspiration for the regime changes that dotted the cold war – but a misleading one. The only successful changer of regimes in the two centuries before had been Napoleon Bonaparte – and his regimes were fleeting.Why dreams of regime change in Iran will end in a rude awakening | Rajan MenonRead moreThe United States helped overthrow Iranian leader Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, but this sowed seeds of resentment that helped birth today’s extremist government. In 1954, the CIA recruited a group of Guatemalan exiles to overthrow the Soviet-leaning leader Jacobo Árbenz. In 1961, US-backed rebels landed at the Bay of Pigs, in a failed attempt to overthrow Cuba’s Fidel Castro. The US and the Soviet Union fought covert and overt wars to topple regimes from the 1960s until the 1980s, especially in Latin America, but also in Africa and beyond.After the cold war, regime change took on a new purpose as American leaders imagined a better world, free of violent ethnic hatred and a post-Soviet space full of flourishing democracies aligned with the United States. The popularity of the theory of democratic peace, according to which democracies are unlikely to go to war with each other, made the practice of turning non-democratic regimes around seem like the bedfellow of world peace and helped justify regime change on moral as well as national security grounds. And so, the US and its allies overthrew more regimes.The first target was Serbian autocrat Slobodan Milošević. His overthrow proceeded in stages, beginning with coercive airstrikes on his allies in 1995, spreading to Serbia itself in 1999, and ending with the toppling of his regime in elections in 2000. The US role in changing the regimes in Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan over the next few years – the so-called color revolutions – was indirect and more limited than adversaries like Russia have made it out to be, but two decades later none of these countries is very stable or democratic. Serbia is ruled by a Kremlin-leaning nationalist. Kyrgyzstan is unstable, Georgia has become a client state of Russia and, sadly, Ukraine is under siege from a vengeful Russian president.The long-term outcomes of fostering uprisings against unwanted regimes have thus not been promising.The 9/11 attacks unleashed a fury of American vengeance that made possible military action on a much larger scale. If the US role in changing the regimes of these post-socialist states was visible mostly in the “grey zone”, nothing was opaque about the overthrow of the Taliban and Saddam Hussein.In Afghanistan, America’s lightning-fast campaign made quick work of the Taliban. But US technological advantages melted in the face of an insurgency in a country that was foreign to most Americans who went to fight there, and in which the US national interest was limited to finding Osama bin Laden. After two decades of trying to construct an Afghan democracy, Joe Biden wisely withdrew, acknowledging defeat, and with it the limits of America’s regime-changing power.Decades of regime-change attempts that yielded lackluster results at best should make the US hesitate before going down that road againIn 2003, the US military also crushed the Iraqi regime with “shock and awe” that impressed the world – just as the Trump administration’s recent bombing of Iran initially did. The regime that replaced Saddam in Iraq was more democratic, but it was also a strategic gift to Iran, who now expanded its power into the vacuum that regime change had created.Military intervention in Libya in 2011 removed Muammar Gaddafi, nobly enforcing the UN doctrine of “Responsibility to Protect”. But it left behind a sore in the side of all of north Africa and the Mediterranean basin, one that added to the chaos in Syria, encouraged the collapse of Mali and facilitated Europe’s immigration crisis.Russia is now attempting regime change in Ukraine but has encountered similar challenges. Its experience there is an abject reminder of the fact that to everyone except the would-be regime-changer, these operations mostly look like brutal imperialism.The unsatisfactory history of regime change can hide the practice’s allure. To live with imperfection, with messiness, with injustice, and with enemies, is very hard to do – especially as the stakes mount, as in Iran in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the diplomatic path is arduous and often leads to dead ends. Diplomatic outcomes are usually tenuous and can be short-lived – as demonstrated by the short life of the original Iran nuclear agreement, negotiated painstakingly under Barack Obama and torn up three years later byDonald Trump.Trump and Netanyahu aim to remake the Middle East with bombs. Iran shows why that will always fail | Sina ToossiRead moreBut decades of regime-change attempts that yielded lackluster results at best should make the US hesitate before going down that road again.Some may hope for internal regime change – an uprising like the color revolutions. But uprisings have not produced stability in most recent cases, and there is no guarantee they would produce a regime in Iran any more conducive to American and Israeli security than today’s ayatollahs. And the more the people rise up, the more a regime like this will crack down. Chaos – in other words, no regime at all – is a likely result.Other leaders and pundits may intend to walk the Trump administration ever closer to the regime-change strategies of George W Bush. A full-scale invasion might eliminate Iran’s nuclear weapons programs, but it would be unmatched in scope and consequences since the second world war. Any hope of success would require the US to prepare to pay a hefty price in blood and treasure.None of this is to deny the serious problem that Iran and its nuclear ambitions present, nor the role that coercion must play in containing it. But decision-makers must not focus single-mindedly on Iran’s nuclear program. They must ask deeper questions.What are America’s real interests in this? How does the character of the Iranian regime affect the lives of ordinary US citizens who simply want to live in peace? How would a forced change of regime affect the character of America’s own democracy, especially if it is carried out without congressional approval by a president who has played fast and loose with the constitution? How will it affect the people of the region? Will they view the US as a liberator or just another one of history’s empires, determined to possess their resources and control their lives?Given the US habit of regime change, to avoid these questions would be as irresponsible as it would be dangerous for the nation and the world.Chris Chivvis is a senior fellow and director of the American statecraft program at the Carnegie Endowment for International PeaceExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

The breadth and scope of his performance were predicted by no polls, no prognosticators, none of the wise men. The ramifications of this upset will be felt for years, across the US and the developed world.In the end, it wasn’t even close. Mamdani’s widespread appeal represents the total collapse of a Democratic party establishment that had weatheredDonald Trump’s first term with rhetorical resistance, and fumbled the beginning of the second with triangulating appeasement. This year, the favorability of theDemocratic partyhas collapsed torecord lows, not because of the popularity of the Trump administration or the Republican party, but because of its unpopularity with its own voters. Chuck Schumer caving to the president on an unpopular and devastating Republican spending bill was the last straw for many. The Democratic party and the resistance to Trump had been severed for the first time.There’s anger across the country with its leadership, Democratic and Republican, in cities, suburbs and rural areas. According to Americans, things are not going well. Prices are up, wages are down and instability is at an all-time high. Nowhere is this more true than in our biggest city,New York, where the moderate Democratic mayor, Eric Adams, made a quid pro quo deal to keep himself out of prison on corruption charges in exchange for enforcing Trump’s policies in a city where Trump had minimal political support.Will the Democrats learn from Zohran Mamdani’s victory? | Bernie SandersRead moreEnter Mamdani. Many major cities in the US, in recent years, had a two-party system, not betweenDemocratsand Republicans, but between centrist Democrats and their progressive flank. The US, like all polities, has many organized political groupings, but due to byzantine electoral laws, only two official ones exist - the state-administered ballot lines. Nowhere is this more true than in New York, the crown jewel of the electoral socialist left in the United States for more than a century.Mamdani is the progeny of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the US’s largest socialist organization in a century. He is among the many young people inspired by Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign. The staying power of that campaign has asserted itself over the years. Most of the talented organizers and thinkers whom it shaped were in college or their early 20s. They were never going to stop being socialists. They just needed seasoning.Mamdani got involved in the DSA as a young man and honed his skills leading campaigns in the nearly all-volunteer organization. He has spent most of his adult life as a DSA organizer. After the New York City DSA had built sufficient infrastructure and he had learned the necessary skills, he was able to win election to the state assembly in 2020. But to Mamdani, democratic socialism isn’t an identity or a set of principles. It is being part of and accountable to a democratic organization, the sort of working-class civil society that has atrophied in this country, but at one time built the backbone of the welfare state across western society and lent the muscle to the New Deal.Mamdani and the DSA cannot be separated. It’s a different, and for many Americans new, but a deeply old way of thinking about politics. Political organizations represent different classes, which are necessarily in conflict. To win for your class, you must bea representativeof working-class democracy.Mamdani was built by the DSA and the young leftwing milieu that emerged after the Sanders campaign. They cannot be separated. Not his charisma or campaign style. He is a product of the movement.His victory and its comprehensive level are shocking to nearly all. How did he do it? Combining new and old tactics. Mamdani had perhaps the most innovative social media campaign in American political history. Not jumping on tired memes, but showcasing his authenticity. He also borrowedold tactics. Mamdani harnessed the sort of retail diaspora politics that have always won in the world’s most diverse city. He campaigned in dozens of languages, met leaders from ethnic groups from around the world and sold his vision in the style of Fiorello LaGuardia. This way, he was able to harness both the insurgent left, often caricatured as downwardly mobile, overly educated and overwhelmingly white, and the worldwide working-class diaspora that shapes the neighborhoods of New York.How did Mamdani win support? He brought back class as the defining issue of politicsAs he climbed the polls through steady mass organization,almost linearly, he began to face ever-increasing, and horrifying, attacks from capital and the powers that be, to the tune of a record $25m in outside spending. The one they homed in on was one that had been proven to take down leftwing leaders across the world, such as Jeremy Corbyn: antisemitism. All social justice-minded people are horrified by antisemitism, an ancient hatred. It’s an accusation that would make anyone on the left, anyone of conscience, take notice. For this reason, used in a spurious way, it was an insidious attack that could break the left. However, in this election, the baseless smear backfired.There are several reasons for this. The first is overuse. It’s quite blatant to continually accuse obviously deeply compassionate and humanistic people of an evil hatred without evidence. No one believes friendly and understanding social democrats in a secular urban milieu are pogromists or jihadists (despite nasty Islamophobic baiting about Mamdani’s background), for obvious reasons.The second is the actual circumstances. Most accusations of antisemitism on the left have little or nothing to do with actual overt discrimination or hatred; they are almost entirely based on opinion of the state of Israel. As Israel continues its genocide of Palestinians and long-term eliminationist and revanchist ambitions, and ties itself closer to the far right in the US, Democratic voters in the US have made the rapid and historic transition to sympathizing with Palestinians over Israel by a nearly3-1margin. Evenlast year, this issue and money could win Democratic primaries. No longer.Mamdani stood firm in his support of Gaza. The Democratic party could learn from him | Yousef MunayyerRead moreLastly, Mamdani is in many ways a continuation of the Jewish left tradition in the United States. New York has long been the home of the most powerful electoral socialist left in the United States. The base for the Socialist party of America (SPA) or the American Labor party, many-time electoral winners, was the Jewish community. Jews in New York voted in thehundreds of thousandsfor socialists for decades. These are the same policies of so-called “sewer socialism” (in which socialists ran cities like Milwaukee and boasted of excellent sewer systems), the same parties (DSA being the direct inheritor of the SPA), the same tradition and even the same neighborhoods as a century ago. The foundation of the American left. An unbroken line. Mamdani is the inheritor of the tradition ofBaruch Vladeck, and of the socialists and trade unions that built New York. Even the membership of DSA and the staff of his campaign reflect this.So, how did Mamdani win support? He brought back class as the defining issue of politics. Class as a political divide has declined across the industrialized world for decades, beginning in the US. While Sanders reinjected a class message and a degree ofclass polarizationback within the Democratic coalition, there were still shortcomings. Bernie did worse among Black voters across class. And Bernie andother democratic socialistsrelied heavily on the good graces of socially progressive upper-middle-class professionals, rendering socialists subordinate to or in coalition with their interests and organizations. After nearly a decade of work by the left, this class polarization seemed uncrackable. Until now.Mamdani underachieved compared with prior leftwing candidates in professional progressive areas like the Upper West Side. But he smashed through the racial barrier that had divided the working class. Few expected this before the votes rolled in. His base would be downwardly mobile white professionals, of course. But his clear message and innovative campaign brought back real class politics, of the kind that seemed a myth in the contemporary age.The left must learn from Mamdani and the DSA and rebuild mass working-class organizationAccording to theNew York Times, Mamdani did better with voters of color than with white voters. While he shed reliably progressive votes among the Times-reading, machine-hating liberals of Manhattan, he won them back many times over among working-class people of color who had never taken a second look at leftist candidates before. In this, he reversed nearly 30 years of anti-materialist political science theories.This may seem like something confined to New York City, a progressive bastion in a deep blue state. But it points a path forward for the left and for advocates of social justice and liberatory politics. Donald Trump’s most shocking and profound gains in 2024 came among young voters, particularly men, Latino voters, Asian voters and urban voters in general. These are the exact demographics that came out indrovesfor Mamdani.The left has long shirked its responsibility to fight the far right, leaving it to the center as if the political spectrum were a rigorously enforced line rather than a fluid concept. But the center failed. And they sacrificed these demographics to Trump because these masses were fed up with the status quo. The center could never win them back. But the radical left actually could, through a targeted, economic, anti-establishment message. Mamdani’s campaign did it, and brought people back from the far right on a massive scale, more than any anti-Trump rally could. In this way, campaigns like Mamdani’s are actively practicing anti-fascism in a real way, by winning the targets of the right back to the left.The left needs to study this shocking election and take thorough notes. The first is that Mamdani was a product of real, organic, working-class organization in the DSA. The kind that has been dying out in this country for half a century and is disregarded by most. This lack of organization is the defining feature of our political time. The only way to the future is more people in the DSA, more people in unions, more people in civic organizations and the rebuilding of working-class community. Our institutions are hollow, but Mamdani and his 50,000 youthful volunteers are proof that they can be rebuilt, and that people yearn to do so.In 2017, a DSA organizer and philosopher named Michael Kinnucan said: “US civic culture is so hollowed out at the grassroots level that in any city in the US if your organization can get 40 to 50 committed people in a room occasionally you’re probably operating one of the five or six most potentially powerful grassroots organizations in your city.”This idea was foundational to DSA, especially in New York City, and shaped Mamdani. For many, it seemed a fantasy. Five hundred thousand votes later, across nearly every language and nationality in the world, it’s a warning. To defeat the right, the left must learn from Mamdani and the DSA and rebuild mass working-class organization. Sure, charisma helps, but at its core, this win was an eight-year project that must be replicated everywhere if we are to defeat fascism and stop the worst horrors of the climate crisis. Mamdani is an Obama-level political talent, but most of all he is a call to return to real working-class organization. This is something the hollow entities of the Democratic or Republican parties could never defeat, and something they learned on Tuesday night.Ben Davis works in political data in Washington DC.

The originally planned two-day meeting was truncated into a single morning’s official business to flatter thepresident’s egoand accommodate his short attention span. The agenda was cynically narrowed to focus on the defence spending hikes he demands from US allies. Issues that may provoke or embarrass Trump – the Ukraine conflict, or whether the Iranian nuclear threat hasactually been eliminatedby US bombing – were relegated to the sidelines.Instead, the flattery throttle was opened up to maximum, with Nato’s secretary generalMark Rutte leadingthe assembled fawning. On Tuesday, Rutte hymned Trump’s brilliance over Iran; yesterday, he garlanded him as the vindicated visionary of Nato’s drive towards the5% of GDPspending goal. No one spoiled the party. As the president’s own former adviser Fiona Hill put it yesterday, Nato seemed briefly to have turned into the North Atlantic Trump Organization.For Rutte and most of the alliance leaders, however, this was 24 hours of self-abasement with a specific goal. The purpose of this first Nato summit of the second Trump presidency was to keep the US as fully on board as possible with the transatlantic alliance. Nothing else mattered. Any repetition of the shocks that JD Vance and Pete Hegseth delivered to Europe at the Munich security conference in February was to be avoided at all costs. In pursuit of that objective, nohumiliation or hypocrisywas too gross.So, was it mission accomplished for Nato? Maybe yes, judging by Trump’s generally good behaviour in The Hague. The 5% pledge was “very big news”, he announced. The US was still committed to Nato’s article 5 collective-defence doctrine, he appeared to say at his post-summit press conference, though his curious choice of words – “We are here to help them protect their country” – will not reassure everyone. The leaders have nevertheless emerged with what Henry James called “the equanimity of a result”. The Nato summit got what it was designed to get.But in every longer term way, this appeasement of Trump solves nothing. In political terms the Hague summit does not mark the resumption of normal relationships, let alone the beginning of a newNatogolden age. Such things are not possible in the Trump era. Politically, the summit was a bunker buster dodged. True, things have not got worse, an outcome that many, including Rutte, will regard as a kind of achievement. However, none of Nato’s other preexisting difficulties has been solved. Most remain firmly in place.0:24'Daddy has to sometimes use strong language': Nato chief on Trump's Israel-Iran outburst – videoOf these, four stand out. The first and most immediate is Ukraine. There has been no change in Trump’s impatience with Ukraine, his belief in a ceasefire or his unwillingness to renew US military aid. But nor can the other Nato members supply the aid that Ukraine needs. So the war grinds on, in part because of Trump. Some believe the war could even become permanent. “Rather than assuming the war can be ended through a comprehensive battlefield victory or a negotiated compromise,” the Carnegie Endowment analyst and former Ukrainian defence ministerAndriy Zagorodnyuk wroteearlier this month, “Ukraine and its allies must plan to build a viable, sovereign and secure state under constant military pressure.” Trump would not be interested in that.The second difficulty is Trump’s sheer unpredictability. Everything was well choreographed in The Hague, but for how long will this last? No one can say for sure. The world is still absorbing the implications of Trump’s impulsive handling ofIran, in which military action was repudiated in favour of diplomacy one day, before war was launched the next, followed by the proclamation of peace on the one after that. The Iran bombing has reminded the US’s Nato allies of just how little sway they actually possess over the president, and has underscored the difficulty of second-guessing Trump’s actions.This feeds through into the third problem. The commitment to spend 5% of GDP on defence is a policy goal not a present reality. The UK, for instance, aims to get to5% by 2035, and it will only do so through some jiggery-pokery over what can legitimately be classified as security, as the government’s new national security strategy document, published on Tuesday to coincide with the Nato summit, makes clear.Ten years is a long time. Much will change. Trump’s successors may be more committed to Nato, or they may be even more unreliable than he is. There could be regime change in other places too. No one knows. Warfare is certain to change, as the drone revolution has shown. Nato needs to be careful not to bring 20th-century assumptions to bear on 21st-century planning. The national security strategy document rightly posits this period as an era of “radical uncertainty”. Yet investors, including investors in high value hi-tech industries such as defence, abhor uncertainty.Trump is angry with a world that won’t give him easy deals | Rafael BehrRead moreWhich brings us to the fourth problem. Patching things up with Trump may solve nothing because hemarches to his own drum. But the threats do not go away. This means that the European Nato nations and Canada have to forge a viable system of collective defence against hostile threats that is not dependent on the whims of the person in the White House at every turn. That is a very large task. But Washington cannot have a veto on whether the nations of Europe defend themselves against, say, Russian aggressions.There is no real choice in the circumstances. The allies are faced with the huge task of gradually reducing their long dependency on the US’s technology and armaments without provoking a complete rupture with the US. At the same time, they must increase their own and Europe’s defence capacity. It is a devilishly difficult course, with which Britain’s political leaders, never mind Britain’s security world, would be profoundly uncomfortable. Yet that is the one on which we are embarked.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNatoOpinionDonald TrumpMark RutteIranUkraineDefence policycommentShareReuse this content"

Why spend billions on weapons – soft power would keep us safeSimon JenkinsWith hawks on one side and doves on the other, we ignore the obvious fact that engagement is the best defence against conflictThu 26 Jun 2025 13.37 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 14.48 EDTShare‘Toadying”, “slavish”, “cringe-worthy” were the words hurled at Nato’s Mark Rutte for the praise he heaped on Donald Trump. But words cost nothing. Keir Starmer went further. He dug into his pocket andgave Trump$1.3bn for just 12 aeroplanes. He promised never to use them, or put any bombs in them, without orders from Washington. He might as well have enrolled in the United States Air Force.Starmer is engaged in a strategic shift in Britain’s global stance – from soft power to hard. He has clearly received the notorious initial briefing that so moved Tony Blair and led him eventually to war in Iraq. It induced David Cameron to spend billions on aircraft carriers that he had intended to cancel. Now the government warns in its strategic review that Britain needs to prepare for the possibility of being attacked on its own soil. Perhaps Starmer agrees with Nato’s Rutte that the British people “better learn to speak Russian”.Russia has never, in its entire existence, tried to invade Britain. Yet to protect its interest a defence industry of vast public expense has sustained this belief. It has demanded we go to war if Russia so much as inches over its border, as if it abutted Norfolk. Clearly Britain needs to defend its cables and its electronic airwaves. It needs to guard its banks and its businesses from mischief. But no one is threatening it with invasion.With the end of the cold war in 1989, soft power should have been unleashed. Every conceivable tool should have been deployed to introduce Russia into the European community of nations. I was one of many westerners in the 1990s who would go to seminars and meetings with eager figures in Moscow’s hierarchy. They were open-minded and democratic and desperate to open dialogues with the west. They sent their children to English schools and universities. Cultural exchange was intense. The same was happening, less openly, with China. It was a time of real hope.Yet the old dog-eared briefings were still being used. We were told we cannot be “too safe”. Nato’s belligerents declared their muscle by advancing to Russia’s border. Barrier after barrier went up, as Russia reverted to its old conflicts with its bordering states. You could sense the west’s defence pundits sinking thankfully back into their old ways.In his definition of soft power, the American academic Joseph Nye suggested that cooperation “is always more effective than coercion … Values like democracy, human rights and individual opportunities are deeply seductive.” Soft power is about building friends and finding allies, rather than creating enemies. Britain, poised between Europe and the US and with English as a global language, was uniquely positioned for this task.Thirteen years ago, a globalsoft power indexfrom the Institute for Government placed Britain as number one, above even that citadel of soft (as well as hard) power, the US. More recently,another indexput it third after Germany and Japan. These are not trivial statistics. They measure the influence a country can be expected to exert in any conflict short of war.Today, the primary east-west power struggle beyond the Ukraine war is essentially soft. It illustrates the west’s poor use of it. The isolation of Russia – economically, culturally and diplomatically – has not altered its aggression in Ukraine. What ishasdone is push Russia closer to China and the non-aligned Brics-plus nations across Asia, Africa and Latin America. China’s soft power projection is enormous, from its belt-and-braces investment outreach to50 cultural institutesdue to open around the world.Why Europe needs a common defence fund – outside the EU | Simon NixonRead moreStarmer’s response has been unbelievable. He wants to outbid Trump in slashing his chief soft power resource, overseas aid. He is making thebiggest cut everin Britain’s aid programme, from 0.5 to 0.3% of gross national income. % He has continued toslash the BBC’s World Service, the nation’s outstanding global presence. With 320 million listeners in English and 41 other languages, it has beenshrunk by 500 postssince 2022. I shall never forget a group of Chinese girls crowded, freezing, round a radio in the border city of Harbin, eagerly practising their English with the aid of the BBC. This outreach is equalled by England’s education system. Since the turn of the century, it has become the start in life for millions, not just from Russia and China but from around the globe. About 390,000 non-EU studentscame to Britainlast year, 19% down on 2023 and a level that is forecast to plunge in future. It must be in Britain’s interest for them to keep coming.Soft power lies in contact – cultural, financial, academic and diplomatic. Opposition to a hostile regime emerges if not from its military then from its commercial and professional class. Ostracism merely drives that class into silence or exile. In Russia, opposition from those who used to influence Vladimir Putin and might restrain him has collapsed. In their place are the sabre-rattlers. Starmer appears to be one of them.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I’ll click on the baby announcements of people I know, people I don’t know, and I’ll definitely click on a birth announcement from a celebrity, even if I’ve never heardtheirname before. It might surprise you to learn that I am not in the habit of judging these names, though. This is for two reasons – one, I’m a bogan from regional Queensland, I’ve heard names you can’t even imagine. And two, I have sympathy for the job!I would personally find it really difficult to bestow a name on a tiny creature that you’ve just met. Do you want the name to be unique or normal? Classic? Classic like how – popular or old lady name from the 50s? What if it’s the name of a sociopath? What if it’s the name of a real estate agent? What does the name mean to you and your entire family, but also your ancestors? What does the name mean according to websites with lists like 500-top-cool-baby-names-for-boys-who-love-their-mamas? What if you named your child something equivalent to Skibidi Toilet without knowing? What is Skibidi Toilet? What if the name helps them get bullied? What if, even worse, the name has zero impact? And on and on.The noises you make every day fill me with disgust. Now I’m not afraid to tell you | Rebecca ShawRead moreSo I don’t judge my parents for naming me Rebecca. Even though my three brothers’ names all start with M, and Rebecca famously starts with R. Even though it’s so common and boring, they could have at least given me Ursula as a middle name and made me “R. U. Shaw”, an instant laugh. But I’ll get over it.This past week, I started to receive a few strange messages from people I know. Messages like “Umm … did you secretly make a TV show?” with a photo of the credits of a TV show and the name REBECCA SHAW listed as co-creator. While I appreciate these people thinking highly enough of me to imagine a world where I made a TV show without talking and posting about it every second of my life, I unfortunately didnotmake a show, secretly or otherwise.I can understand the confusion – the show in question is Adults, a new (very funny!) ensemble comedy that is described as a gen z vibes Broad City. That is a concept and project that it makes perfect sense for me to be involved with (except that I am old). But in this case it was not me – Adults was made by the bizarro world Rebecca Shaw, who I have encountered before. (In this case “bizarro world” means she is funny, talented, works in a similar field but in America, and is far more productive.)This is not my first encounter with a more famous Rebecca Shaw. For my entire adult life I have been sent photos of books in secondhand stores by the very prolific author Rebecca Shaw, who wrote a successful series of gentle novels called things like A Country Affair and Trouble in the Village. For a long time, when you Googled the name Rebecca Shaw, she was the main Rebecca Shaw. Then, for a time when you Googled Rebecca Shaw, her description (and the fact she had died in 2015) would come up but with a photo of me.We all know that Juliet (from Romeo and Juliet) once asked,“What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”, but it’s easy for her to say – Juliet has a cool unique name. In my grade 10 maths class, there were literally FIVE Rebeccas. Then, my first girlfriend was Rebecca (luckily already went by Becky), and she went on to date another Rebecca. The overpopulation of Rebeccas would be OK if it wasn’t in such stark difference to the conversely small amount of famous women named Rebecca. We do not have proper A-list representation and it isweird.I am sick of seeing the rich and powerful on my screen. Where are all the TV shows about normal people? | Rebecca ShawRead moreAccording to anecdotal evidence and my not continuing maths after grade 10, about 40% of white women with boring names born in the 80s are called Rebecca. Yet, can you think of a current A-list star that is named Rebecca? The other white-lady-no-imagination names in my cohort are ones like Sarah, Jennifer, Jessica, Rachel. I can name at least four currently very famous women with each of those names off the top of my head. Ben Affleck has dated more Jennifers than there are famous Rebeccas. Of course there have been some notable Rebeccas throughout history and in pop culture. The book Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier. Rebecca Romijn. Rebecca Black. Bec Hewitt. Bec Hewitt’s wedding poem to Lleyton Hewitt. That’s a thin list for such a popular name.It just feels like at the moment, and actually maybe forever, Rebeccas are flopping. Instead of standing out, we have gone with infiltration into the population. We are everywhere you look … except on lists of celebrities and people with influence. We have a couple of exciting rising Rebeccas – for example, Rebecca Hall and Rebecca Ferguson are both extremely talented, very beautiful actors who are starring in more and more high-profile movies. Bizarro World Rebecca Shaw is obviously killing it. But we need more, to shore up the ranks. We need Rebeccas to rise up, to break out, to become stars. If it’s too late for us, and it may be, we need a new generation of possibly powerful Rebeccas. So I’ll keep clicking on your baby announcements, crossing my fingers for a Rebecca to pin my hopes on.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

But, as our new series uncovers, it doesn’t have to be this wayInthis series, writers discuss the causes of – and solutions to – the housing crisis in key European citiesThu 26 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 10.44 EDTShareHousing is as personal an issue as it gets. Homes are where we take refuge from the outside world, express ourselves, build relationships and families. To buy or rent a house is to project your aspirations and dreams on to bricks and mortar – can we see ourselves sitting outside in the sunshine on that patio? It can also be a deeply frustrating process – can we afford that house? For more and more of us, the answer is no.Experienced at such an individual level, it’s easy to think that rising costs are a problem particular to your community, city or country. But unaffordable house prices and rents are a continent-wide issue. According to the European Parliament, from 2015 to 2023, in absolute terms, house prices in the EUrose by just under 50%on average. From 2010 to 2022, rents rose by 18%.As an editor, I wanted to know some of the stories behind these stats and, as a person who lives in a very expensive city (hello from London!), hear some solutions. I commissioned a range of housing experts to contribute to a series,The housing crisis in Europe, describing what the situation looks like in some of Europe’s most expensive cities.Agustín Cocola-Gant writesabout how changes to policy after the 2008 financial crisis encouraged wealthy foreigners to buy second homes or short-term rentals in Lisbon, pricing locals out of their city. Now some Portuguese families rent rooms, not flats.In a reversal of roles, it’s the newcomers who have it worse in Amsterdam, according to Amber Howard. Older, long-term residents live in secure and affordable social housing while younger people and recent arrivals, often on lower incomes, are left to the costly and insecure private housing sector. While social housing stock has dropped over time, private stock has increased as politicians sought to encourage wealthier residents to move into the city.It’s a similar story in Budapest, says Csaba Jelinek. Social housing was sold off after the end of the cold war, and private ownership was championed as a rejection of socialist values. What this has meant in practice is older Hungarians investing in housing and driving up prices and rents for younger generations.One city not facing an affordability crisis is Vienna. As Justin Kadi writes, since the 1920s the city has had a stable stock of social housing for tenants of all incomes. Like in Amsterdam, newcomers rent privately, but social housing has had a damping effect on rents.You don’t need to be a housing expert to see the dynamics playing out in Europe’s housing market. Over more than 40 years, housing policy has favoured those who invest in homes at the expense of those who live in them. This power imbalance is at its most stark in countries with big institutional investors – such as private equity, hedge, insurance and pension funds – as Tim White explores in his piece.Peace, permanence and affordable prices: six ways to solve Britain’s housing crisisRead moreWhen houses are not homes but assets, there is a transfer of wealth from those who have not to those who have. Across Europe – and much of the rest of the world – property has become a driving force of inequality. In turn, inequality is a driving force of resentment. Far-right politicians have tapped into this anger for their own political gain, as reported by the Guardian in a previous series of reports from the frontlines ofEurope’s housing crisis. As the European commissioner for jobs and social rights, Nicolas Schmit, commented: “The housing problemdivides our societies, and it may be a risk for our democracies.”Housing policies are set at a national level, but the European Union can set frameworks and support access to finance. In 2024, all housing ministers from member states signed a declaration calling for a “new deal” on affordable and social housing.There are solutions, and there is political will, and in the meantime let’s hope this series will go some way to helping those who face unaffordable housing across Europe realise they’re not alone.Kirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsEuropeThe housing crisis in EuropeHousingInequalityCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

Better food regulation and social policy are more likely to give lasting resultsThu 26 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 03.22 EDTShareAmedicine that takes away your appetite by making you feel full and a bit nauseous doesn’t sound very attractive, but it is a price many people are ready to pay for the chance to lose weight. Although widely available privately, until this week only doctors in specialist clinics were allowed to prescribe tirzepatide (Mounjaro) to treat obesity on the NHS and it was almost impossible for GPs to get their patients into these clinics. People up and down England will no doubt rejoiceat the newsthat their own doctor can now prescribe it.Any celebrations may be premature, as the criteria for prescription in the first phase of the rollout are so tightly drawn that few patients will qualify. You need a body mass index (BMI) of more than 40, which corresponds to a weight of 102kg (16st) for a woman of average height or 123kg (more than 19st) for a man. (The BMI criterion is slightly lower if you come from a high-risk group.)To be eligible, patients need to be not just at risk of complications from their obesity, but already suffering from them. They must have existing diagnoses of four out of five specific conditions: type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in the blood (dyslipidaemia), obstructive sleep apnoea and damage to blood vessels. Individually, all of these conditions are fairly common, and they are more likely if you are obese. However, in our GP practice of 12,500 patients, we have identified only two who meet these criteria. Anticipating a rush of inquiries, we have asked our reception staff to tell patients that we will contact them if they qualify.In the second phase of the rollout, expected next summer, the BMI threshold will be lowered, although as the list of conditions will stay the same, it seems unlikely many more of my patients will qualify. I have some patients who are really stuck with very severe obesity, with a BMI of more than 50, who I think would benefit from this medication, yet I cannot prescribe it as they do not have the specified diagnoses.NHS delays may drive patients to buy unsafe weight-loss drugs, says top GPRead moreOne of the reasons for the slow pace of the rollout mandated by NHSEnglandis probably a fear of overwhelming GP services. Six hours of training is advised before we start prescribing, and patients should be seen monthly and monitored for adverse effects as the dose is increased, and then every six months. As the criteria relax, and the number of eligible patients expands, this will add up to a lot of extra appointments. Along with the injections, patients should also have “wraparound care”, which will provide diet and exercise advice.We are waiting to hear from our integrated care board about exactly how this will be provided to our patients, but the dietary advice is important. Many people who are obese are nevertheless malnourished as the food they eat is often high in fat and sugar and low in essential nutrients. If, in response to appetite suppression, they eat very much less of the same low-quality food, they may run into significant problems with lack of protein, vitamins and minerals. Dehydration may also be a problem as thirst is reduced as well as hunger. Rapid weight reduction causes loss of bone and muscle mass as well as fat, so exercise is needed to prevent frailty.Tirzepatide is not cheap: at the maximum dose, it costs £122 a patient a month, or £1,464 a year. This could be considered a bargain if you compare it with the cost of treating obesity-related conditions, and we should factor in the improvements in quality of life that achieving a healthy weight will bring. However, there are big questions to answer around how long people should use weight-loss drugs for, and what happens when they stop.Majority of children will be overweight or obese in nine areas of England by 2035, study showsRead moreRebound weight gain is almost universal after a period of dieting but it appears to beeven more rapidafter taking drugs such as tirzepatide; one study has found that patients can expect toreturn to their original weightwithin under two years of stopping. This feels inevitable, as much of dieting is learning to change your response to your body’s signals of hunger; if you’ve been taking a drug that abolishes those signals, then when you stop and your appetite returns, you are likely to respond exactly as you did in the past.At a population level, I worry that by concentrating on this technical, pharmaceutical fix to our obesity problem, we are heading down the wrong path. More than a quarter of theadult population in England is obese, and medicating them all in perpetuity surely cannot be the answer. If the government is serious about its much-heralded shift from treatment to prevention, we need bolder and more imaginative plans to tackle obesity. We need restrictions on the availability of calorie-dense, nutritionally poor, fast food.Taxing sugar and fat would be one way of altering the nation’s diet, and we should also look at the quality of school meals. Beyond food regulation, we need to buy back school playing fields, offer opportunities to exercise for free, and encourage active transport by making pavements pleasant and cycle routes safe. The current obesity crisis arises from a complex mix of social and commercial determinants of health and these are not problems that can be fixed with a simple injection.Helen Salisbury is a GP in OxfordDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But whatever happens next, the moral stain will remainThu 26 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 06.30 EDTShareOne year ago, as cheering supporters waved union jacks to celebrate Labour’s election landslide, Keir Starmer walked into Downing Streetwith a promise: the country had voted “for change. For national renewal. And a return of politics to public service.” On Tuesday, his government will ask parliamentto remove benefitsfrom more than 1 million disabled and sick people.You will have already heard much about the Westminster drama of the vote. More than120 Labour MPshave signed an amendment aiming to kill the bill next week, with more stillsaid to be joining, presumably fuelled by the sense this was not the “change” they were elected for. It has been a welcome relief to see such moral strength, with backbenchers and even a now former government whip dodging alleged threats of deselection to stand up for their constituents. Starmer says he will “press forward” with the cuts,describing the rebelsas “noises off”, but behind the scenes No 10 is said to be desperately trying to get MPs – including frontbenchers – back in line.In the coming days, the papers will inevitably splash on what the size of the rebellion means for Starmer’s premiershipwhile pundits gas about rumoured resignations, as though all of this were a game and the only casualty a promising ministerial career. Let’s remember, then, what – and who – it is MPs would be voting for. With the number of people relying on disability benefits growing, the government plans to tighten eligibility for personal independence payments (Pip). That means up to 1.2 million disabled people, many of whom are already in some of the poorest households in the country, could losebetween £4,200 and £6,300a year they need to pay for the extra costs of disability. Under the changes, due to be introduced in November 2026, disabled people would not qualify for Pip unless they score a minimum of four points on an assessment designed to measure their ability to carry out a single daily activity, such as washing or getting dressed.Look at Labour’s cruel attitude towards disability benefits, then tell me Keir Starmer cares about 'human dignity' | John HarrisRead moreIf that sounds like technical jargon, just talk to Lee – a worried reader who emailed me – and the human impact of the policy becomes clear. Lee has multiple debilitating health conditions – from muscle wasting and joint pain to depression and daily seizures – and was reassessed for Pip in March. He scraped by to win the lowest benefit rate, but didn’t score the magic four points in any category – which means that if MPs vote to change the rules, it is likely Lee will be rejected next time he’s assessed. That’s despite the fact he needs help from his partner to shower, cook and use the toilet. Lee is “petrified” of losing his disability benefits and his seizures are increasing from the stress. “I couldn’t survive without the support I receive,” he says. “It would be a death sentence for me.”NoLabourminister will tell you they want to take Pip from people like Lee. No politician who cuts disability benefits ever says out loud, “We will take support from people who rely on it.” Instead, they cast doubt on reality, chipping away at trust in the social security system and, with it, our disabled neighbours. They say we should give benefits to people who “genuinely need them”, as though not everyone receiving them does. They pick a “good reason” for cutting support – a bloated welfare bill, say, or a labour market crisis – and paint empathy as costly and cruelty as prudent.That’s why government figures – including Starmer himselfin response to the rebellion– repeatedly claim the cuts will getdisabled people into work, even though a Pip award has no relation to whether someone has a job or not.It is telling that the official forecast for the policy’s impact on employment isn’t due to be publisheduntil October– meaning that MPs are being asked to cut disabled people’s benefits on the basis it will help them find work without any evidence to back this up. Or, as Labour MPstabling the amendment put it: “We are being asked to vote before consultation with disabled people and before impact assessments.” Facts, it seems, don’t trump fiscal rules.Even if a few thousand long-term sick people get jobs as a result of the changes, it will pale in significance compared with the number pushed into penury:analysis by Trussell and WPI Economicsshows nearly half a million people in disabled households will be forced into severe hardship if the government goes ahead with the full cuts. “Tightening eligibility criteria” is a neat euphemism for withholding the money disabled people need to live.The Pip change is only the beginning. In the same bill, MPs are due to vote tocut the health top-upof universal credit for new claimants from £97 a week to £50 in order to, in the government’s words, fix a system “which encourages sickness” – as well asscrap it entirelyfor under-22s. That’s still not all: when the work capabilities assessment is abolished, Pip will become the “gateway” for this benefit, so swathes of people who lose Pip won’t be eligible forout-of-work sickness benefitspayments either.Like many, Lee receives both Pip and universal credit – which means Labour’s “reforms” could see his two main strands of support pulled away. On top of that, his partner could also have her carer’s allowance taken, as that’slinked to Pip eligibilitytoo. Lee has already done the maths. If both his disability benefits are stopped, he will lose precisely £718.87 per month. That works out at roughly half his income. “I’ve told the crisis team [these cuts] would be the end of me,” he admits. “Why would anyone want to go on without any support or quality of life?”That’s the thing with Westminster drama. Politics is only a game if you are privileged enough to be cushioned from its effects. For others, it is what decides whether there is enough food in the cupboard or whether a care worker arrives to help you wash your hair.In 2015, fresh from the coalition pact, the Liberal Democrats were punished by the electorate for helping the Conservatives push through sweeping public spending cuts. Come the next general election, the accusation will not be that Starmer’s Labour cosied up to the Tories for power, but that they embodied them: their cruelty, their austerity and, ultimately, their failure.In the event the rebel amendment wins or Downing Street is forced to pull the vote or water down plans to save face, it cannot undo the fact that the government wished to enact these cuts in the first place. If the bill does go ahead, the division lobby will shine a light not simply on the chasms in the Labour party, but between compassion and careerism, bravery and betrayal.Forget the MPs who rebel over cutting disabled people’s benefits – remember those who don’t. This is Labour’s poll tax. Its tuition fees. Its Partygate. Just as the Iraq war was for Tony Blair, disability cuts is the moral stain that will mark Starmer’s government and the party for years to come. Severely disabled and ill people are going to be starved, isolated and degraded as a result of this policy. No Labour MP who backs it should be forgiven.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Still, whether it involves working with broken business models or the disruption of AI in creating content, there is always hope in the face of an uncertain future if you have the trust of your audience. In the chaos of media distraction and twisted truth, trust is everything.So it is of great concern if the country’s most trusted news outlet squanders this valuable attribute. The federal court ruled thatthe ABC unlawfully terminatedthe journalist and Media Diversity Australia co-founder Antoinette Lattouf in December 2023. The evidence gave an unflattering insight into the broadcaster’s multilayered management and found that Lattouf had been unfairly fired for her political opinions. But what has shaken trust internally and externally is the impact of an orchestrated campaign by pro-Israel lobbyists.Sign up to get Guardian Australia’s weekly media diary as a free newsletterYou break trust with the broader community when an interest group can go to the top of an organisation and get its way. Lobbyists skip the process that everyone else must follow. And it hits particularly hard among people who struggle to have their voice heard.Deep in the 185-page Lattouf judgment is a forensic critique of the ABC’s top brassRead moreFor culturally diverse staff, offering a different perspective based on your insights and experience carries a risk. What should be a healthy process of testing the adequacy of a position can instead be a belittling experience, or you are labelled a threat to impartiality. For many journalists, Lattouf’s experience at the ABC is a familiar one of shutting down the person instead of discussing the position. If that wasn’t enough, the public broadcaster then pursued a legal argument that Lattouf had to prove the existence of a Lebanese race – a daring journey deeper into the territory of mistrust for a leadership team not following the compass of its company principles. The ABC withdrew the contentious race argument and apologised. Still, staff need to know it was withdrawn because senior leadership knows it is wrong and not just because of the angry response to it. We are weary of the cycle of corporate concern, review and apology, particularly when those involved continue to break new ground of mistrust with employees.Even more significant for the ABC is the break in trust with a multicultural audience. These communities already feel silenced by a media industry that neither understands nor represents them. Building trust with our communities means nurturing inclusion and calm reasoning around our most contested and controversial news stories. Silencing one side of the story isn’t success. Shutting down voices is not “social cohesion”. But silencing and shutting down were the preferred responses of senior ABC management under pressure from pro-Israel lobbyists. We need a different approach to our most difficult conversations.When I attended a multicultural community consultation event in Sydney I was surprised by the importance our culturally diverse leaders place on media representation in creating a sense of belonging. Of all the challenges the communities face, the issue of media representation and trust is persistent. They are also concerned about how misinformation and disinformation will affect them, particularly their brilliant and bright young people. They value trusted sources of truth but it is hard to trust Australian media when the reporting of your community doesn’t match what you know to be true.There is now considerable constructive discussion about media literacy and educating multicultural communities about news and credible news sources. But the decline in trust in the media should not be a problem for the marginalised audience to fix. It is the responsibility of news organisations to improve their cultural literacy and be open to adapting their position so both sides are better equipped to lift public discourse, not shut it down.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWeekly BeastFree weekly newsletterAmanda Meade's weekly diary on the latest in Australian media, free every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, he found himself at the helm of one of Hollywood’s biggest franchises at its most critical junctureThu 26 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 26 Jun 2025 12.52 EDTShareLike an ancient warhorse hearing the bugle for one last time, readers of a certain age will be snorting and whinnying at the words “Gareth” and “Edwards”. They are irresistible madeleines for the legends of Welsh rugby: unfeasible 70s sideburns, neck-high tackles and JPR Williams on the overlap.These days, though, things are different:Gareth Edwardsis also the name of the unassuming, Midlands-born fortysomething film director sitting in front of me, who has quietly acquired a reputation as one of Britain’s most accomplished franchise movie-makers. “I’ve had it my whole life, to be honest,” he says. “My dad was a massive rugby fan. My comedy goal is thattheGareth Edwards does something and everybody goes: ‘Oh, the film‑maker?’ That would be it. I could die happy after that.”While there is no immediate prospect of this Gareth Edwards finishing off aneight-man move and going over in the corner– any more than there is of Willie John MacBride taking on the next Iron Man movie – you sense that the tide may eventually turn in the younger man’s favour. With a Star Wars and a Godzilla movie under his belt, not to mention the Christopher-Nolan-esque sci-fi parableThe Creator, Edwards is now perched atop the new Jurassic World movie – the seventh in the series, if you count the three Jurassic Park films – which is slightly ominously subtitled Rebirth.A scorched-earth approach … watch the trailer for Jurassic World Rebirth.As gigs go, it doesn’t get much bigger. Edwards is stewarding the franchise at a critical moment: even though the last film, Dominion, proved as commercially robustas its predecessors, it took such a critical pasting, not least fromthe Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw, that the future of the whole thing was in doubt.Diplomatically, Edwards says “they just wanted to press the reset button slightly” – although Rebirth, as its title suggests, does rather more than that. It junks the entire cast and characters of the previous three films, ditches the theme-park-gone-wrong through-line and generally adopts a scorched-earth attitude to what went before. (Devotees of the franchise will be glad to know that the series’ basic DNA – involving ferocious dinosaurs and creepy corporate types attempting to exploit them – remains unchanged.) Edwards says a new beginning was very much the plan. “The honest truth is that, when the script arrived, it didn’t have the wordsJurassic Worldon the front. It really felt like a new chapter.”Even so, anyone who reads the movie-industry trade press will know that Edwards wasn’t the first name on the team sheet; what is more, theHollywood Reporter rather ungallantly described him ungallantlyas “more shooter than auteur”. Edwards, though, brushes this sort of thing aside with aplomb and readily offers an insight into how the Hollywood hiring game works. He says he found out the Jurassic producers were looking for a new director after spotting an article in the very same movie-industry trade press and messaged his agent (“is it worth throwing my hat in to see if they’d be interested?”) just as the franchise’s producer Frank Marshall was tentatively reaching out to him.View image in fullscreenCreature feature … Whitney Able in Monsters, Edwards’ directorial debut.Photograph: Vertigo Films/AllstarHe had a weekend to read the script – “I basically spent that weekend hoping I would hate it, because I kind of wanted to have a break and not do a big franchise movie” – and then found himself pitching to Marshall, a Hollywood legend who has worked on movies including Raiders of the Lost Ark, Poltergeist, The Sixth Sense and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. “I just went through my little list and waited for him to have an allergic reaction. And then, right at the end, he went: ‘OK, do you mind repeating everything you just said to me tomorrow to Steven?’ And I thought: oh shit, I assume he means Spielberg. Maybe there’s three Stevens.“So the next day I am pitching a Jurassic film to Steven Spielberg, which is very surreal. Halfway through, he asked for a pen and paper and started writing stuff down. And I thought: oh, is this a bad sign or a good sign? Then, at one point, he just stopped and smiled and went: ‘That’s great.’ And I felt like: OK, can we just end my life now? Because it can only go downhill from here.’”It’s a great pitch-meeting story, perhaps matched only by the one in which he gets a talking-to from another Hollywood big shot, Thomas Tull, just before the pair went in to Warner Bros to sell Godzilla in the early 2010s. “I felt like my whole life was hanging on what I said over the next half an hour. As we were walking there, he said: ‘Remember, Gareth, you are not auditioning for them, they are auditioning for you. If they don’t want you to do this movie, we’re going somewhere else.’ Whether he meant it or not, it was the best thing he could have said to me.”View image in fullscreen‘The studio wouldn’t leave anything to chance’ … Felicity Jones in Edwards’ 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.Photograph: Jonathan Olley/Lucasfilm/AllstarQuite how Edwards got here seems to baffle even Edwards himself. He is still awestruck by the fact he is rubbing shoulders with his childhood movie heroes – Spielberg, George Lucas – but is focused and tough enough to channel it into his own creative inspiration: “They managed to make what I consider to be art and commerciality at the same time. They managed to combine [the two to create] the holy grail. Jaws is a masterpiece and it was the most popular movie ever made when it came out. So that’s your benchmark, right? Like, what’s the matter with you, Gareth? Why can’t you try to do that?”Edwards cut his teeth in visual effects (he won a TV Bafta in 2006 fora BBC drama-documentary about Hiroshima) and applied those skills to his first feature, Monsters; released in 2010, it still looks amazing, despite being produced on an inconceivably small budget. Having established himself as the Kevin Smith of the creature feature, Edwards experienced a vertiginous ascent after being picked by Tull to oversee Hollywood’s latest attempt to take on Godzilla, going from Monsters’ $500,000 budget to a $160m blockbuster. “I felt I was getting crushed as I was doing it. I felt like: I don’t know if I’m going to survive this.”Having scrambled up the learning curve, Edwards can look back with a measure of calm. “Any movie like that is a machine, and the machine kicks in and you’ve just got to [do it]. You’ve got to know the battles you can win and the ones you can’t, the ones that are worth dying on a hill for and the ones that won’t really matter at the end of the day; they might hurt your pride a little bit, but the audience is not going to notice or care.”View image in fullscreen‘I felt I was getting crushed as I was doing it’ … Bryan Cranston(left)and Aaron Taylor-Johnson in Edwards’ 2014 film Godzilla.Photograph: Warner Bros/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe Godzilla gamble paid off handsomely and the lessons appeared to stand him in good stead: he rolled straight in to another fanboy dream project, a standalone Star Wars film. The experience of makingRogue One: A Star Wars Storywas marred by muchafter-the-event mutteringthat the scriptwriter Tony Gilroy had been brought in to re-shoot and re-edit much of the film, but Edwards remains unbowed: “It’s the nature of doing a massive film with that much pressure on it – the studio just wouldn’t leave anything to chance.” In any case, it is evident that the kerfuffle did not have any long-term effect on his standing.Edwards clearly has a talent for what Hollywood likes to call “vision”: an ability to orchestrate grand, sweeping visuals into which spectacular digital visual effects are seamlessly integrated. Rather more unusually, he also likes a roving quasi-documentary camera, giving many sequences a combat-movie edge. He also has a predilection for a certain type of scene, which you will notice if you watch all his films in a row: people dying horribly trapped behind a sealed glass door, often with someone they love watching it happen. (“Maybe I got trapped as a kid in one of those automatic doors in Sainsbury’s, or something, and my mum left and I couldn’t get out.”)That was then; this is now. Like most of Hollywood, Edwards is waiting hopefully on Rebirth’s box office performance, as movie theatres cautiously haul themselves away from the Covid disaster and try to beat back the menace of high-end TV. On the surface, at least, he seems sublimely unbothered by it all. “This movie is kind of what I’ve been waiting for. I felt that if we get the right cast, then really it’s a playground for me to do the things I love doing, you know? So I was like: it’s mine to screw up.”Jurassic World Rebirth is in cinemas in the UK, Ireland and the US from 2 July and in Australia from 3 JulyExplore more on these topicsFilmJurassic ParkJurassic WorldJurassic World: Fallen KingdomGareth EdwardsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Since the 1980s, he has created more than a dozen multiyear series, tackling extractive industries like mining and oil refining in India, China and Azerbaijan, traveling to such disparate places as Western Australia, Chile’s Atacama desert and the so-called ship graveyards of Bangladesh.‘Human activity on a massive scale’: a photo exhibition tackles the climate crisisRead moreOften taken from high in the sky, his photos offer views of industrial landscapes that attend to color and pattern with a sophisticated eye reminiscent of abstract expressionism, while also forcing us to contend with the devastating transformations to the natural world required to sustain our way of life.Burtynsky’s new show at the International Center ofPhotographyin New York, titled The Great Acceleration, brings together some 70 photographs from a lifetime behind the lens. It seeks to offer a fitting survey of a masterful photographic career, and it debuts the largest photographic mural that Burtynsky has ever done.His relationship with the medium began when he was about 12, when he got his first camera. As a young child, he spent hour upon hour painting alongside his father, who had hoped to become an artist but ended up working in factories. After he learned to painstakingly sketch landscapes and paint with oils, the ease of photographs was a revelation. “I just realized how in one fraction of a second I can create a landscape – just, boom, it’s there,” Burtynsky told me. “I loved how it was a modern, fast way to get your image, and I loved the darkroom, watching the image emerge.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Charles RousselSimilarly, Burtynsky’s relationship with the industrial world that has become his subject goes back to his formative years – originally trained as a tool and die maker, he came of age working within factories, seeing first-hand just how dirty, loud and dangerous they really were. “When I saw the scale of industry, as a young 18-year-old working in these places,” Burtynsky said, “I could tell that if we were going to become this population of all this growth that they were projecting, then all of this was just going to amplify, this all was just going to get bigger and more insane.”Turning away from such a life, Burtynsky began to study the graphic arts, and after a well-timed push from one of his instructors, he made the decision to receive formal instruction in photography. After spending so much time around heavy industry, he said, it was a revelation: “All of a sudden, I’m exposed to the whole history of art, and the whole history of music, and the whole history of photography.” It was in school that Burtynsky got exposure to major influences like Eadweard Muybridge, Carleton Watkins, Caspar David Friedrich and painters of the New York school, particularly Jackson Pollock. It was there that he also began to develop his distinctive way of seeing the world.“I really liked the kind of field painting, the compression of space, the gesture, the color fields, in abstract expressionism,” he said. “So I started doing landscapes, but I said: ‘I’m not just going to go out into the forest and do cliches like anybody else. I’m going to go and try to do Jackson Pollocks with a large-format camera. I’m going to try to attune my eye so I can find really complex spaces in nature that are almost like gesture paintings.’”View image in fullscreenMines #13, Inco – Abandoned Mine Shaft, Crean Hill Mine, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, 1984.Photograph: Edward Burtynsky, courtesy Howard Greenberg Gallery, New YorkIn no small part because of that painterly eye, Burtynsky imbues his work with an undeniable beauty, a fact that has sometimes made critics uneasy. Shots like that of a enormous stepwell in Rajasthan, or the Chino mine in Silver City, New Mexico, are mesmerizing in their intricacy, their arrangement of color and the hypnotic way that Burtynsky has framed the innumerable lines within. If his photographs of environmental destruction are gorgeous, Burtynsky defends them on the ground that this pleasingness evokes the curiosity and engagement that leads to potentially fruitful dialogue.“There are all sorts of issues that start to rise up. Like: are you aestheticizing the destruction of the planet?” he said. “Well, that’s not how I’m looking at it. But maybe. I’m really trying to find a visual language that has a painterly or surreal quality to it that shows the world we’ve evolved in a way that makes people engage with it, versus saying: ‘That’s just a banal picture of something that I’m not interested in.’”Burtynsky is clear about the fact that his images are meant to be not didactic but enigmatic, entry points and not endpoints. Although it is difficult to look at shots such as a wasteland full of discarded tires or a mountainside honeycombed by extractive mining without feeling a gut reaction of shame and eco-anxiety, his photographs are much more than just environmentalist agitprop. The artist takes pride in the many interpretations that his works can hold.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daniel Terna“My photographs are like Rorschach tests,” he said. “It’s like the teacher puts a picture in front of the class and it’s like: what did you see? If they see environmental degradation, they see something out of the history of art. If they see something, like, technologically kind of advanced, or some curious way in which we do things as humans, each one of them is a legitimate reading of what they’re seeing – the individual completes it. When people tell me about what they see in an image, I get to learn more about them than they probably learn about me.”In addition to delivering some of Burtynsky’s most career-defining works, The Great Acceleration also shows lesser-known sides of the photographer – there are two pieces from his student days, a shot from a rarely seen series that he made exploring masculinity via taxidermy workshops, and never-before-shown portraits of individual workers who toil within the built landscapes that he specializes in. “I would walk through these landscapes with my 2 1/4 camera, and every once in a while I’d see a person and say: ‘Can I take your photograph?’ It was always an acknowledgement of the sitter in their space, and just another way of showing that these are things that humans are doing,” he said.Burtynsky hopes that shows like The Great Acceleration offer a way to let a wider audience see what is happening in the world. He remains doubtful of art’s ability to directly transform how governments and industry use our resources, but he does believe in the value of raising awareness and sparking curiosity. “Artists are soft power, we’re storytellers, we don’t have the ability to influence or shape policy. What we can do is raise consciousness, absorb our experience of the world and move it through the medium of our choice. I’m trying to be a kind of conduit into what is happening.”Edward Burtynsky: The Great Acceleration is on show at the International Center of Photography in New York until 28 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPhotographyExhibitionsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Except this statue is not as solid as it sounds but a photographic mural of Kentridge in horse-riding pose behind a skeletal wooden horse constructed from parts of artist’s easels with a saddle slung over its cardboard tube of a body. Kentridge mocks himself, and mocks the pretensions of sculpture. Or does he? There’s a confident, showoff brilliance to this illusion and the parallel with a previous great artist is obvious.Another sculpture, a more solid one, Goat, is a swirling tangle of lines solidified in space, capped with a goat’s head. It’s a homage to Picasso’s 1950 sculpture The She Goat. When you see Picasso’s art it’s not so much one specific work that awes you as the boundless flow of creativity that moves from one style to another in an inexhaustible, playful stream. Kentridge lays claim to that legacy here – and with justification. He is just about the only artist now who can dizzy you in a comparable way with the abundance of his creativity as his impulses dance from drawing to film to collage and back to drawing.Is this an artist – or a coffee pot? The great William Kentridge reveals the strange secret to a great self-portraitRead moreAlways drawing. In his2015 film More Sweetly Play the Dance, reality and drawing magically interweave: a silhouetted procession of real people walk and dance across a blasted landscape to jazz and African music, bearing banners and sculptures that are in fact Kentridge’s drawings.

Or does he? … still from Self-Portrait as a Coffee-Pot, 2022.Photograph: Courtesy Kentridge Studio, © William KentridgeMore Sweetly Play the Dance, created as an elegy to victims of Ebola, is the kind of collective artwork at which Kentridge excels. This Johannesburg artist makes political art, not so much through declamatory content, as through collaborations with communities of musicians, dancers, actors. He can capture collective tragedies and span modern history. This film’s power is enhanced by being shown across multiple screens, an embracing, constantly moving panorama with sound from repurposed gramophone horns. In the same screening roomOh to Believe in Another World, his animated history of Soviet Russia, becomes an even more menacing farce than when it was recently shown ona single screen with live orchestra on the South Bank.Kentridge’s film art is, on the whole, much more compelling than his sculptures. On screen he brings it all together, animating his drawings, collages and puppets, using sound as superbly as a conductor, which makes sense. When he was three, Kentridge wanted to be an elephant, but when he was 14, his dream was to lead an orchestra.Failing in both ambitions, he became an artist.Self-Portrait as a Coffee-Pottells this autobiographical story in a series of nine films, shown on a large TV screen in a corner of a gallery that re-creates his studio – and it takes all day to see in its entirety. It should be on TV, for it is made in a documentary format with Kentridge as an authoritative “presenter”, speaking in his deep voice and soft accent, in a manner reminiscent of the great television author presenters of the past like Jacob Bronowski or Robert Hughes. Except he keeps being interrupted by his own double.The technological wizardry that enables Kentridge to debate with himself is so state of the art you see double. Both Kentridges wear his habitual white shirt and speak in the same compelling voice, but they disagree. When Kentridge One reminisces about a childhood picnic when the family ate boiled eggs and sardines on a spread-out newspaper, Kentridge Two begs to differ. “What newspaper was it?” “The Sunday Times.” “Our mother would never have spread out a newspaper for a picnic, and especially not the Sunday Times.”View image in fullscreenMovement is the essential thing … Cursive, 2020, by William Kentridge.Photograph: Thys Dullaart/© William KentridgeAs they argue, they draw, and the drawings flow exquisitely as he sketches remembered landscapes, self-portraits, still lifes.

Looking in the mirror to admire his own noble features, in a sequence inspired by the Marx Brothers’ Duck Soup, he instead sees a Black woman looking back at him. While one Kentridge says he is most himself while drawing introspectively, the other claims he is most himself working collaboratively in theatre, opera, you name it. These two facets reveal a subtle soul who moves merrily between private imaginings and public designs.Movement is the essential thing. Cinema is in every fibre of his being. He shows a series of small bronze sculptures along shelves, and it’s like a film reel. So, is freezing his images as monumental sculpture a folly, like trying to fix a childhood memory in your mind? No. These sculptures are just one more experiment for an artist who is always on the move, always ready to share. At the top of the green hill above the gallery is his huge bronze sculpture of an ampersand (&). Dark and stark, yet funny and warm, the typographical symbol for “and” is a perfect symbol for his art of addition.William Kentridge: The Pull of Gravity is atYorkshire Sculpture Park, Wakefield, 28 June until 19 AprilExplore more on these topicsWilliam KentridgeExhibitionsYorkshire Sculpture ParkSculptureArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the another, the two float, Ophelia-like, side by side.But the Grzeszykowska in these photos is not Grzeszykowska at all: it is a silicone replica of the artist, handcrafted for the 25 photographs in her series Mama, which isnow on view at Melbourne’s Buxton Contemporary.View image in fullscreen‘All of my works are a play with the viewer’ … Polish artist Aneta Grzeszykowska.Photograph: Supplied by Aneta GrzeszykowskaIn Mama, Grzeszykowska takes on the much-fetishised effigy of womanhood – the doll – and entrusts herself into the care of her daughter, who plays with her, cares for her, and terrorises her. It’s a subversive act, taking the most hallowed of relationships – that between mother and child – and flipping it.“All of my works are a play with the viewer,” Grzeszykowska tells me from her home in Warsaw, where she lives with her husband, the artist and her longtime collaborator, Jan Smaga, their daughter, Francziska, and their coterie of pets. A cat slinks past the screen, wiping her tail across Grzeszykowska’s face.View image in fullscreen‘Who hasn’t wanted to strangle their mother, at least once?’ … Aneta Grzeszykowska’s Mama #29.Photograph: Aneta GrzeszykowskaGrzeszykowska apologises for her English, which is excellent; at times she worries she can’t communicate some of the deeper themes in her work, which I don’t notice at all. “Mama is about the relationship between mother and child,” she says. “But the viewer forgets that the real mother, me, is outside of the frame taking the pictures. You forget the person pulling the puppet strings. It becomes about what you see, not who is creating the scene.”Fourteen images from Mama are being presented at Buxton as part ofthe veil, an exhibition curated by Hannah Presley that explores memory and identity through a collection of photography, film, fibre art, printmaking and sculpture by Grzeszykowska as well as artists Hayley Millar Baker, Hannah Gartside, Glenda Nicholls, Lisa Waup and Lena Yarinkura.Grzeszykowska grew up in Warsaw and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts at a time when the city had only one private gallery, the avant garde Foksal Gallery, which was established in 1966. As she was graduating in 1999, just 10 years after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, Warsaw’s contemporary art scene was beginning to bloom. Representatives from the nascent gallery Raster came by the art school, scouting for students to represent.“It was annoying!” she says, laughing at how naive she had been. “At the time, we didn’t understand what that could mean for us as working artists. But then we saw some artists they worked with, like Wilhelm Sasnal, becoming very successful. Suddenly we could imagine a future as full-time artists, without having to do practical jobs too.”Grzeszykowska has always used her body as her medium for expression – in part, she says, for “practical reasons”. She admits she is a “control freak” and finds it easiest to work by herself.Her early works were her “way of trying to understand my place in this new world.” One way was by inserting herself into the canon of feminist art history, which she first did inUntitled Film Stills 2006, a series she describes as “a precise and truly Warsaw remake” of Cindy Sherman’s photographs. “I essentially erased Cindy Sherman from the pictures by inserting my own body. But it’s also a self-erasure or symbolic ‘art suicide’ because no one really sees me. What remains is still Cindy Sherman.” She now feels it was “quite brave”: “It was my way of saying, ‘I can be Cindy Sherman too.’ I was very young, and I wanted to be her.”View image in fullscreenGrzeszykowska’s Mama series inside the veil, at the Buxton Contemporary, the University of Melbourne.Photograph: Christian CapurroMuch of her oeuvre feels cinematic. An eerie picture from Mama, taken through a crack in the bathroom door, shows Francziska’s hands reaching towards the doll’s back and neck. But just as Hitchcock used humour to express darkness and violence, there’s something comical in the image, too. Who hasn’t wanted to strangle their mother, at least once?“I see my works as tragicomedies,” Grzeszykowska says. “I don’t want my work to be only serious or only sad. Life is already sad enough! But even in sadness, somehow there’s space for humour. That’s how we get distance, and with distance comes insight … The sadness can be funny. This constant search for perspective is part of my work, especially the existential, philosophical side. I don’t like the uncertainty of life, not knowing what comes next. But when I use that feeling in my work, I regain some control over it. It becomes a strategy, a way of coping.View image in fullscreenAneta Grzeszykowska’s Mama #34.Photograph: Aneta GrzeszykowskaThe life of an artist is a privilege, she says: “There’s this special thing about art, at least from my perspective: if something is really difficult in your real life, it can actually become very good for your work.”The veilruns from 27 June until 1 November at Buxton Contemporary, Melbourne; entry is free.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyExhibitionsMelbourneArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Something. Something has emerged from the vast opaque corporate entity that is Amazon MGM, which swallowed up theJames Bond brand from Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli– the latter being reportedly discontented (though presumably very much richer).White smoke has emerged from the funnel marked “director” – though still nothing from the funnel marked “star” – and it’s a really big hitter.Denis Villeneuveis the Canadian film-maker who gave us the excellent science-fiction moviesArrival,Blade Runner 2049and Dune Parts One andTwo, and has demonstrated a real flair for big-budget action thrillers inSicarioand Prisoners, with plenty of the ambient sexiness in hardware and spectacle. (Perhaps Villeneuve will now get the ultimate corporate blessing of being a last-minute wedding guest at the Bezos wedding in Venice this weekend, precisely the sort of event that tends to feature as a Bond film opening scene, to be disrupted by helicopter attack, explosion, kidnapping etc. Mr Bezos himself needs a white persian cat on his lap to stroke.)View image in fullscreenGood with leading men … Dune: Part Two stars Timothee Chalamet, Austin Butler, Denis Villeneuve and Josh Brolin.Photograph: Gregory Pace/REX/ShutterstockVilleneuve is much more than a safe pair of hands or a technical director who can be relied upon to do what the suits tell him; he is an alpha-grade auteur in the same league as Christopher Nolan and so his presence will reassure the fanbase with mixed feelings about the Amazon sale. The message is that, yes, Amazon is still thinking big and that the future Bond will be primarily up there on the big screen where Villeneuve has made his reputation and not simply on the smaller screens where long-form streaming content is reportedly going to be spun off: The Adventures of Moneypenny, The Prequel Adventures of M etc etc. (Although these are surely in development.)But even given that Villeneuve is in place and he can work perfectly happily with James Norton or Regé-Jean Page or Henry Golding or Tom Hiddleston … what about the writing? When Danny Boyle was temporarily and unhappily brought on as director in 2018, the problem was that he had his own very specific creative vision as regards story, wishing to work in tandem with his own longtime collaborator, the screenwriter John Hodge. But their ideas wouldn’t fly with Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli who had their own trusted writers, Bond script veterans Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who had a track record of getting the goose to lay the golden egg as regular as clockwork.View image in fullscreenAnd women … Emily Blunt in Sicario.Photograph: Richard Foreman, Jr.  SMPSP/Lionsgate/AllstarWho will Villeneuve want to work with? He co-wrote with Jon Spaihts on Dune, with Hampton Fancher and Michael Green on Blade Runner 2049, with Eric Heisserer on Arrival and with Taylor Sheridan on Sicario – on the face of it, he has no sustained partnership in the way Boyle had with Hodge and so he is perhaps not yet married to any high-concept visionary plans, which are going to go over badly when he presents them to Amazon. My guess is that, among these existing writers, he might more instinctively want to work with Sheridan who has certainly shown he can deliver action, thriller-drama and unresolved sexual tension on the “secular” level outside science fiction.But basically, yes,Denis Villeneuveis very good news for Bond: a smart, capable director who is going to produce the bangs for Amazon’s buck and a witty, involving story for the fans.Explore more on these topicsDenis VilleneuveJames BondThrillersAmazon Prime VideoAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

History of the World: Part I (1981)“It’s good to be the king.” Brooks mixes sight gags, dad jokes and Borscht Belt standup in historical vignettes from the stone age to the French Revolution. Results are hit and miss, and the ancient Rome segment goes on for ever, but the tasteless Torquemada musical number is a scream.9. The Twelve Chairs (1970)View image in fullscreenShameless hamming … The Twelve Chairs.Photograph: Ronald GrantIn the USSR, circa 1927, an ex-aristocrat, a conman and a priest search for a missing chair stuffed with jewels. Brooks’s second film, adapted from a popular Russian novel, feels ponderous compared to the rest of his work, despite shameless hamming from Ron Moody, Dom DeLuise and Brooks himself. Frank Langella, alas, is miscast in his first film role.8. Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993)The Kevin Costner school of English heroism gets the Brooks treatment with Cary Elwes as Robin Hood, Dave Chappelle making his film debut as the outlaw’s sidekick, and a perplexing detour into The Godfather territory featuring DeLuise stroking a lizard. The laughs come fast, cheap and silly, but some of them hit the bullseye.7. Life Stinks (1991)Brooks plays the leading role in a Trading Places-adjacent morality tale of a billionaire who accepts a bet that he can survive on the Los Angeles streets for a month. This comedy about homelessness bombed, but has a winning integrity and some decent gags, such as Brooks responding to his cardboard shelter getting washed away with: “There goes the neighbourhood.”6. Silent Movie (1976)With intertitles instead of dialogue (“He is truly the lord of the winos” is my favourite) and a score comprising nothing but music and sound effects, Brooks’s meta-comedy, in which he plays a Hollywood director trying to make a silent film, is almost experimental. The celebrity cameos are cute, and Brooks’s tango with his real-life wife, Anne Bancroft, is adorable.5. Spaceballs (1987)View image in fullscreenStar quality … Mel Brooks in Spaceballs.Photograph: Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto/AllstarThis Star Wars spoof arrived 10 years too late, but now seems more fun than any of the official sequels and spin-offs. You can gauge the level of humour by character names like Dark Helmet, Dot Matrix and Yogurt, but the cast (including Bill Pullman and John Candy) is game for anything, and there are some inspired postmodern gags. And hurrah! Spaceballs 2 is in development!4. High Anxiety (1977)Brooks, as the acrophobic head of the Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous, is framed for murder, menaced by pigeons and cornered in the shower (by the future director Barry Levinson) in this sporadically brilliant send-up of Alfred Hitchcock’s oeuvre. Brooks’s penchant for breaking the fourth wall reaches its apex in a scene in which the subjective camera forgets to look where it’s going.3. Blazing Saddles (1974)View image in fullscreenPriceless … Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder in Blazing Saddles.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarThis shambolic western spoof cemented Brooks’s position as the heir to crazy Hellzapoppin’-style humour in the years before Airplane! Cleavon Little plays the Black sheriff (co-writer Richard Pryor was deemed uninsurable) who takes himself hostage, Madeline Kahn does a priceless Marlene Dietrich impersonation, and the flatulent cowboys have earned their place in cinema history.2. The Producers (1967)A washed-up impresario (Zero Mostel) and a neurotic accountant (Gene Wilder) hatch a scheme to get rich from a guaranteed Broadway flop called Springtime for Hitler. Brooks, storming the barriers of good taste with his directing debut, celebrates showbiz, revels in Jewish and gay caricatures, ridicules Nazis and has since made a mint from the bona fide stage musical adaptation. “Goddag på dig!” as Ulla the Swedish secretary would say.1. Young Frankenstein (1974)View image in fullscreenImpeccable … Teri Garr, Peter Boyle, Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein.Photograph: TCD/AlamyWe’re now farther away in time from the release of Brooks’s affectionate homage than that film was from the early Universal horror titles it was spoofing. Too many highlights to list, but let’s hear it for Peter Boyle’s zip-necked monster singing Puttin’ on the Ritz; Gene Hackman’s blind hermit; the brain of Abby Normal; and Wilder, impeccable in the title role. A sweet, funny classic in its own right; we shall not see its like again.

Yet, despite his fame and Oscars recognition,Al Pacinostruggled for 30 years to make a movie about one of the 20th century’s greatest artists because “art films” are “always difficult to get off the ground”.He refused to give up on a drama about Amedeo Modigliani, a tortured genius who faced repeated rejection before his life was cut short in 1920 by tubercular meningitis, aged 35.The film, Modigliani – Three Days on the Wing of Madness, is directed byJohnny Depp, and will be released in cinemas in July.The Italian painter-sculptor had struggled to sell his work while battling poverty and an addiction to drink and drugs. Today, demand for his elongated portraits and sensual nudes is such that one of his paintings –Reclining Nude, from 1917-18 – sold for a record $170m (£113m) in New York in 2015.Pacino said of Modigliani: “There is something in this story that is not just identifiable with [the] artist. There is that connection to rejection in all of us, so it gives audiences something they can relate to.”Set in war-tornParisin 1916, it is a fantasy that chronicles 72 hours in the chaotic, bohemian life of Modigliani as he tries desperately to escape the squalor of Montmartre and find recognition as an artist by meeting a famous collector, played by Pacino, who said: “Unfortunately, it doesn’t turn out to be as he expected.”Depp cast the Italian actor Riccardo Scamarcio as Modigliani, saying: “When I saw Riccardo, his eyes reminded me of Oliver Reed. I love Oliver Reed. He was dangerous and he was funny and he was cool … In Riccardo, I see something of Oliver Reed, as well as of Marcello Mastroianni, the classic movie star.”View image in fullscreenRiccardo Scamarcio as Modigliani.Photograph: Leo PinterPacino recalled that he and Martin Scorsese had tried in vain to develop the Modigliani film. At one point, Depp was to play the artist with Pacino directing, but still it did not happen.Now their actor-director roles have been reversed in a production made possible through a collaboration with the producer Barry Navidi, with whom Pacino has worked on several acclaimed films, including The Merchant of Venice, a 2004 film in which he played Shylock.The writers Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski adapted a drama that was originally written for Pacino decades ago by the late playwright Dennis McIntyre, who “had a great love of Modigliani”, Pacino said. “You could feel it in his play.”Asked whether he regretted not taking the lead role originally, Pacino said: “I wanted to do it, but sometimes the timing just doesn’t work out … Sometimes when your career is in a certain place, you are fielding all sorts of ideas that come your way and you can lose track of things because projects take so much time to evolve.“I can name about four or five of them that just went in different directions and never got off the ground because, in the end, it’s a collective – a matter of getting a writer, director, producer etc together to make it happen.“If you just want to interpret a role, finding a writer with the same level of enthusiasm, a talented director to come onboard along with a skilled producer is challenging, but I did find that in Scarface. I found that connection in Modigliani as well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it’s about an artist and those films have been sought after. There have certainly been some great films about artists over the years.”Pacino singled out movies about Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Munch and Toulouse-Lautrec, the latter played by José Ferrer: “Each one of those films had their own context and were independent of each other, different in ways, but at the core that feeling of being judged and undervalued are there.”He recalled approaching Navidi about Modigliani: “I knew Barry had an interest in films with an edge and sophistication.”He had also suggested that he speak to Depp about directing it: “I have known Johnny through the years and thought he would find something there that resonated with him.“It took a few years to get that script together and, as we all know, independent films take a while to develop. You really have to stick with something in this day and age in those early stages.”Modigliani–Three Days on the Wing of Madness is in cinemas from 11 July.

The response was a surprise for the developer. The game looks interesting, people wrote in the comments, but was “ruined” by AI art. But the game’s cover art, used as the thumbnail for the YouTube video, was in fact made by a real person,according to developer Lana Ro. “We know the artist, we’ve seen her work, so such a negative reaction was unexpected for us, and at first we didn’t know how to respond or how to feel,” Ro said. “We were confused.”It’s not wrong for people to be worried about AI use in video games – in fact, it’s good to be sceptical, and ensure that the media you support aligns with your values. Common arguments against generative AI relate to environmental impact, art theft and just general quality, and video game developers are grappling with how generative AI will impact their jobs. But the unexpected problem is that the backlash against generative AI is now hurting even those whodon’tuse it. “I would rather people be overly cautious than not,” veteran game developer andChessplusdigital directorJosh Caratellisaid. “But being collateral damage does suck.”Caratelli and his game Chessplus were caught up in a similar situation when heposted some art to Reddit– sharing explicitly that it was commissioned andnotmade with AI. Even then, Caratelli said he’s received several comments and direct messages accusing him of lying about it, or suggesting he’d been duped. “It’s very clearly hand drawn,” he said. “It was a fair whack of money to spend for an indie team on a piece of art. We thought it was worth it.”View image in fullscreenDarth Vader as he appears in Epic Games' Fortnite, which recreates actor James Earl Jones’ voice using conversational AIPhotograph: Epic Games/Disney/LucasfilmIt’s becoming increasingly common for people to call out instances where a game seems to have used AI in a way that replaces human work. (Epic Games was singled outrecently for its AI Darth Vader.) But sometimes, that anger is misdirected at people and companies that are simplybelievedto be using AI.This is what happened when a Magic: The Gathering artist was accusedof using AI, forcing Wizards of the Coast to put out a statement on the false accusations. Even Nintendo was accused, in May, of using AI-generated images for in-game billboards in Mario Kart World.Nintendo put out a statementto deny the claims.Bigger companies such as Wizards of the Coast and Nintendo may be able to weather false accusations, but indie studios with less influence may have a harder time. Little Droid, released in April, stars a little robot navigating a lush pixel-art world. Its cover, on the other hand, renders the droid in a totally different style – with the smooth, glossy finish that people have come to expect from AI art generation tools. People in the YouTube comments pointed to specific details to “prove” the art is AI-generated: the robot itself is asymmetrical, because AI has issues with symmetry; the glow or lighting look off; some naysayers simply argued that real people don’t draw like that. Stamina Zero, in the comments, continued to hold its ground – that no AI was used in development of the game or its art.Then the studio posted a video it said proves it, showing several steps in the art’s process. The video showed early art concepts, navigating different layers in Adobe Photoshop as a way to demonstrate how the art came together. “We contacted the artist and asked her for all the available intermediate sketches and the source PSD with all the layers,” Ro said. “Based on all the available files, we put together a video as quickly as possible and posted it … It was a damage control move – a way to calm things down and make the discussion more productive. We had nothing to hide and were ready to be transparent.”Some people relented, accepting the video as proof that AI was not used. Others were unconvinced. There’s no actual drawing in the video, which would be impossible to share unless the artist was recording their entire process. That is something some artists do already – but it creates additional work for them. And, as Stamina Zero found out, there will always be people who still don’t believe.The trailer for Stamina Zero’s Little Droid“To be honest, I don’t have a clear strategy for how we will proceed in the future,” Ro said. “There was advice on Reddit not to make art similar to the results of AI work, as this triggers people. And this tip could work. But AI learns from the work of artists and, in the future, it is quite possible that it will be able to replicate any style.”Caratelli shares the community’s ethical concerns about AI plagiarism, environmental impact and human creativity. But he was dispirited by the accusations against Chessplus. “It’s really hard for AI to make things with meaning. It’s a thousand little intricacies that make a game great … [That] work isn’t being valued,” he said. Ro agreed: “It’s completely unfair that so many people who have honed their craft for years are facing this and being wrongfully accused.”Both of these games are examples of how generative AI has poisoned the creative well, even for creators whoaren’tusing it. We can never be totally sure, now, whether we’re looking at something that a human made or not, as even proof can theoretically be fabricated. For creatives and players, it will have to come down to a relationship of trust.Explore more on these topicsGamesArtificial intelligence (AI)PlayStationnewsShareReuse this content"

I’d just played the Jobs for a Change festival, in the middle of London, easy to get to by tube. But Glastonbury was like being on an island. You had to deal with the weather, the food and the toilets. It was also mainly populated by Bristolians. I performed once solo, but also got up on the Pyramid stage with [country and western singer] Hank Wangford to do (Get Your Kicks On) Route 66. The original Pyramid was made from corrugated iron and doubled as a cowshed. I remember it being swampy backstage. There were no bars, you had to bring in your own beer. Keith Allen and [Scottish poet] Jock Scott blagged their way in, pretending to be a Belgian film crew, and sold cans of Red Stripe for 50p.Glastonbury’s still an island. You can’t just walk down to the tube station and grab a Greggs. The thing I look most forward to is the Crumble Shack [food stall], which you can see when you’re performing on the Left Field stage, and for a man of my age, is very distracting. Instead of the great issues of the day to speak about, all I’m thinking is: “Shall I have ice-cream or custard with my rhubarb crumble?”Fatboy SlimPyramidstage 1986Norman CookThe first time I played Glastonbury was with the Housemartins. We’d never played to a crowd that large before, let alone played during daylight. We also thought it would be full of bearded hippies who’d throw mud and piss at us. Instead, the sun shone, we made lots of new friends, and I fell in love with the festival. I still have a bootleg of the performance. You can hear the nerves and excitement in our voices: we’re generally in tune, but we play everything way too fast. The crowd seemed to grow organically: people wanted to see for themselves what four spotty boys from Hull had to say about the state of the nation. It took me 38 years and 98 DJ sets to get back on the Pyramid stage. Last year I joined [former Housemartins bandmate] Paul Heaton to reprise Happy Hour and celebrate our good fortune to still be allowed to play at the best festival in the world.AshNME stage 1995View image in fullscreenYoung blood Ash in 1995.Photograph: Rob Watkins/AlamyRick McMurray (drummer)Our singerTim [Wheeler] had finished school days earlier. Kung Fu had topped the indie chart and nearly cracked the Top 40, but Glastonbury was the first time we felt its impact live. It was also the first time we played Girl from Mars. That Glastonbury performance helped launch it skywards, into the charts, and into a wild few years that took us from indie clubs to something close to Beatlemania in Japan. Our Glastonbury set was the moment we stopped being a part-time school band and became a full-time touring machine.Two years later, we were back, headlining the Other stage on Friday. Then came a knock on the bus: Emily Eavis asking us to step in as Sunday headliner on the Pyramid stage. Just like that, we’d headlined both stages in one year.It was mind-blowing.You can even spot my future wife in the crowd during Kung Fu in 95. It’s our 10th anniversary this year – I need to dash to the petrol station for some flowers!Shed SevenNMEstage, 1995Rick WitterWe’ve only played Glastonbury once – 30 years ago, in 1995, the year it was boiling hot. Oasis were there and Robbie Williams in his red Adidas tracky top and peroxide blond hair. I don’t remember watching any of the bands. I think I got caught in the fact that we were playing Glastonbury. It’s hard not feel like a small cog in this huge music event, but the crowd were amazing. It’s funny when you write a set of songs and then you start getting noticed: loads of things just suddenly fall into place, like getting booked to play Glastonbury. It was a bit like the first time we were played on the radio; we pulled the car over to the side of the motorway to listen to ourselves. Glastonbury was like that. It’s not often you get to appreciate those moments as perhaps you should. We can’t wait to go back!Scissor SistersPyramidstage & Dance tent 2004Jake ShearsI remember how excited we were. We didn’t have a notion of how large it was going to be. I remember our drum tech, Nigel – this amazing soul – giving us a pep talk, saying: “This is yours for the taking.” It rained during our afternoon show, but we still had a blast. Our second show in the Dance tent is still one of my favourite sets ever. It was truly electric. There was something magical in the air. It felt as if the whole world had spun around. Then our debut album went to No 1. Really magical things happen at Glastonbury. The madness and magnitude still blows my mind to this very day.View image in fullscreenJake Shears of Scissor Sisters performing at Glastonbury, 2004.Photograph: Kieran Doherty/ReutersBabydaddyIt was a moment of synergy. It felt like the stars were aligning. We played twice on the Saturday: the Pyramid stage mid-afternoon, and the Dance tent early evening. I think we realised for the first time that this was going to be something that, as New Yorkers, we were going to be accepted for. I also remember the mud. I wore wellies for the first time, trying keep our stage clothes intact and look as glamorous as we possibly could. Glastonbury isn’t just a music festival. It’s a party, an art installation, a cultural touchstone, a spiritual destination. It remains one of the most special memories in our career.Kate NashParkstage 2007View image in fullscreenA walk in the Park … Kate Nash at Glastonbury in 2007.Photograph: Sonny MalhotraI was in awe of Glastonbury because I’d never been before. We set up our tents and stayed the whole weekend. It was a muddy year: I remember buying a red poncho, and I did an interview with NME wearing a bright yellow American Apparel hoodie. I remember seeing Lily Cole at a coffee stand and thinking she was so beautiful, and admiring Lovefoxxx from CSS’s sequined bodysuit. I also got “married” to my best friend when Iggy Pop played I Wanne Be Your Dog. I stole a chicken ornament with Emmy the Great, which I ended up gifting to Amy Winehouse on Jack White’s tour bus. Playing Merry Happy on the Park stage, as I sang the lyrics “I can watch a sunset on my own”, the sun came out and it felt magical.Self EsteemGuardian lounge 2009View image in fullscreenSelf Esteem at Glastonbury, 2019.Photograph: Michael Cragg/The GuardianRebecca Lucy TaylorThe first time I performed as Self Esteem was on the BBC Introducing Stage in 2019. But I’d performed with my previous duo Slow Club in 2009, 10 years earlier. We played the Guardian lounge, so we did our little trick of leaving the stage and coming into the middle of the room, because the tent was quite big and there weren’t very many people. I remember thinking: “I wish we were playing on a bigger stage,” and felt really jealous of everyone that got to. It was also around the time of swine flu, so I spent most of that Glastonbury very poorly in a tent, while everyone else had fun. I’m looking forward to going back this year and making some new memories.Rizzle KicksBBC Introducing stage 2013Harley SylvesterWe were playing a secret set, so we weren’t allowed to announce it until a few hours before. It was a super-fun set, and the crowd was packed. After that, it all gets a little bit blurry. I remember we had some TV interviews to do. Our TV rep – who still to this day is one of my favourite people – said: “All right boys, you’ve got an interview in four hours. I want you to come back nice and calm and relaxed.” You can’t say that to two 21-year-old boys who are experiencing Glastonbury for the first time. The interview we did isn’t fun to watch. Well, it’s hilarious to watch if you’re not me or Jordan. But we were young and at Glastonbury, so we were going to take advantage. We’re super gassed to be playing again, and even better that we are properly on the bill this time.Festivalgoers arrive for Glastonbury 2025 – in picturesRead moreJordan StephensI was not sober. I vaguely remember watching Primal Scream and the Rolling Stones. I then spent three days in the late-night area, Shangri-La. I’m not sure if I slept. I was in this whirlwind vortex of drum’n’bass and deep house. I spent a whole morning at the Stone Circle feeling spiritually uplifted by the coming together of wonderful people and the rising of the sun. I felt so at one with nature, I refused to sleep in a tent, but ended up getting a rash over the whole of my body and then couldn’t leave my house for a week.Black Country, New RoadPark stage & West Holts, 2023Georgia Ellery:It was the first time I’d been to Glastonbury. I was lucky enough to be playing twice, on Saturday with Jockstrap and on Sunday with Black Country, New Road. So technically my first performance was with Jockstrap! I was very nervous, knowing everyone at home would be watching on telly and some of the songs would live on YouTube forever. I’d sprained my ankle the night before, so I had to ice my foot before we went on. We walked on stage to the theme tune to Succession. I also remember how hot it was – luckily I was wearing my gold hot pants and top. I came off stage thinking we’d butchered it and it had gone terribly. But all our friends and family ensured us that the vibes in the crowd had been great. I wanted to celebrate, but I couldn’t exactly have the biggest night in the world because I had another show to play the next day.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury festivalBilly BraggKate NashRizzle KicksScissor SistersFatboy SlimAshfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They say the great priority of humanity should be to colonise Mars. That’s not just mad, it’s dangerous.“It encourages the notion that Earth is temporary and expendable, that we don’t need to cherish and protect it because we can just move on. In reality Earth is the only place where humanity can thrive. The problem is, we’re trashing it.‘Curate your own Glastonbury’: the BBC team bringing festival into millions of homesRead more“If Musk and Bezos really want to live on Mars, fine, go for it, do it. Just don’t expect the rest of us to come with you. That’s why we’ve built a rocket at Glastonbury so we can send them to Mars while we party on Earth.”Gideon Berger and Stephen Gallagher, the duo behind Block9, said: “Led By Donkeys are national heroes. They consistently call out bullshit on behalf of the people of the UK. Their activism sits perfectly alongside Block9’s own values and we are delighted to work with them on this collab.“Seeing as the tech bros are so keen on Mars, it seems only fair to help them get there. Our installation captures the moment when we wave off our least favourite public figures to a far and distant red planet. Goodbye for ever, Elon.”Led By Donkeys explained why they chose the festival for their latest installation. “Glastonbury is a pretty special place,” they said. “It has enormous cultural heft. Even if you’ve never been, you probably have a Glastonbury moment you remember. It’s a place where artists feel free to come and say something and despite what some commentators would have us all believe, it still has a radical edge.”A series of mugshot-style images of Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg complete the work, each clutching a placard.View image in fullscreenLed By Donkeys started by flyposting over billboards and posting its work on social media.Photograph: Phil Fisk/The ObserverThis year’s Glastonbury festival, renowned for its activism, is expected to be politically charged against the fraught geopolitical backdrop.The Irish-language rap trio Kneecap have drawn controversy over alleged statements they made concerning Gaza. One of the members has been charged with a terror offence and senior politicians,including Starmer, have said they should not be performing at the festival.“The right gets terribly exercised about what it calls ‘cancel culture’ but the single most policed and punished area of commentary is around Palestine,” Led By Donkeys said. “Kudos to Glastonbury for not canning the Kneecap slot despite huge pressure, including from the prime minister. Starmer’s got a country to run, yet there he is telling us all who should and shouldn’t be allowed to play the West Holts stage. It’s nuts.”Led By Donkeys started by flyposting over billboards and posting its work on social media. Within weeks, it had raised hundreds of thousands of pounds from donations, and became more ambitious in its messaging. Among its most well-known action was the lowering of a remote-controlled banner reading: “I crashed the economy” behind Liz Truss in the middle of an onstage talk voicing her support for Trump’s re-election, prompting the short-lived former PM to leave.Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Led By DonkeysElon MuskMark ZuckerbergJeff BezosnewsShareReuse this content"

The museum has a longstanding commitment to preserving local heritage.The prize was presented on Thursday night to Rhiannon Hiles, the chief executive of Beamish, by the comedian Phil Wang, a judge for the awards, at a ceremony at the Museum of Liverpool.“Beamish is a worthy winner of this year’s award,” Wang said. “Our visit was one of the most fun days I’ve had in years. An unbelievable level of commitment from staff, and a jaw-dropping amount of detail ran through everything.

It recently completed itsRemaking Beamishproject, which included the recreation of a 1950s town developed with community input.

Each side is expected to take roughly four hours, followed by a one-hour government rebuttal.Combs wasarrested in Septemberand charged with one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and has denied the allegations against him.If convicted on all counts, Combs could face up to life in prison.Federal prosecutors allege that Combs led a sprawling “criminal enterprise” for at least two decades that, with the help of employees and close associates, engaged in a series of crimes including sex trafficking, drug distribution, kidnapping, arson, bribery and other crimes.The government accuses Combs of using violence, threats, money, drugs, and influence to abuse and coerce women into participating in drug-fueled sex marathons with male escorts – referred to as “freak-offs”.Combs’s lawyers haveacknowledged past incidents of domestic violence, but they have argued throughout the trial thatall sexual activity was consensual and part of a “swingers lifestyle”. They have maintained that no criminal conspiracy existed.On Thursday, Slavik broke down each of the five charges against the music mogul.With regards to the racketeering conspiracy charge, she said: “The concept is simple. The law recognizes that when someone commits a crime as part of a group, what the law calls an ‘enterprise’, they’re more powerful and more dangerous.”Describing Combs as the center of that enterprise, she said: “It’s his kingdom. Everyone was there to serve him.”Slavik described the enterprise as Combs’s “trusted inner circle” who, at Combs’s direction, helped the music mogul carry out and cover up crimes.Slavik said that Combs’s “younger and eager” employees “didn’t blink an eye” when they were given tasks, and followed orders to make Combs happy, even if it meant facilitating crimes.Slavik reminded the jury of the the allegations made against Combs during the trial from two of his former girlfriends, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura and a woman identified as “Jane”, as well as the allegations made by former employees and others.Slavik walked the jury through the various crimes that prosecutors have alleged the enterprise committed, which include drug distribution, sex trafficking, arson, bribery, forced labor, transportation for prostitution and kidnapping.In court on Thursday, Combs sat and listened at the defense table as members of his family, including several of his children, were packed into the courtroom behind him.The defense will deliver its closing arguments on Friday.The prosecutionrested its caseon Tuesday after more than a month of testimony from 34 witnesses.Those called to the stand over the last seven weeks includedtwo of Combs’s former girlfriends, several of Combs’sformer employees, male escorts, law enforcement agents, public figures such asrapper Kid Cudiandsinger Dawn Richard, and many others.Shortly after the prosecution rested on Tuesday, Combs informed the court that he would not testify. His legal team then rested its case without calling any witnesses of their own, instead submitting a series of exhibits and relying on their extensive cross-examinations conducted throughout the trial.Combs has been held in federal lockup in Brooklyn since his arrest last year.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

And I think the people that come here are into all those things. People that don’t agree with the politics of the event can go somewhere else.”He added: “I still take a lot of pleasure from all of it. I’m enjoying every day. And Emily is doing so well. I’m just feeling really safe with the show being in her hands.”The former Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker,who left the BBC One show last month, will be speaking at the Information stage in the Silver Hayes area on Saturday as part of a panel called Standing Up for ‘Getting Along’ in a World that’s Being Pushed Apart.He told the festival newspaper: “It’s basically along the lines of: everything is done to try and divide us, and I think if people can pull together – because I think most of us are decent human beings – then just a bit more kindness in the world would go a long way at the moment.”Explore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivalMichael EavisEmily EavisKneecapMusic festivalsActivismnewsShareReuse this content"

The Pyramid stage sets will be available to stream live in ultra-high definition and in British Sign Language.“I used to watch Glastonbury on the TV,” says Jamz. “I remember being like 19 and watching artists like Janelle Monáe performing, but it wasn’t as interactive. With the iPlayer it’s all happening live and you’re able to almost build your own festival from the performances. There is something for everyone.”The dizzying scale of the task of broadcasting the festival falls to a team at BBC Studios, the broadcaster’s commercial subsidiary, lead by the executive producer Alison Howe. The operation will feature more than 90 artists across more than 90 hours of coverage, using 58 cameras and 50km of fibre cable, and is months in the making.“The performances alone, that’s a bit of a task – a brilliant and beautiful task, I may add,” says Howe. “Some artists want to work quite intimately with their performance and how we capture it. Others are very happy to just let us get on with it, because we have a good rep there for making all artists look and sound good on the BBC.“Then there’s the amount of hours across all the TV, curated and presented coverage, and then all the live streams. So when I sit and think about that, I feel sick.”Jonathan Rothery, the BBC’s head of pop music TV, works with Howe in effect as commissioning editor forGlastonbury festivalto shape the offering. He is still in awe at the scale of the challenge. “I remember having a moment there a couple of years ago,” he says, “after a very busy day … just looking at all of the cablework running across the site – I’m not a technical person so it blew my mind.”View image in fullscreenThe BBC’s Jonathan Rothery, Alison Howe, Zoe Ball and Lorna Clarke with the festival organiser, Emily Eavis (centre).Photograph: BBCThis year the producers face a headache over theinclusion on the lineup of Kneecap, a trio of Irish republicans who have been accused of making statements on stage in support of Hamas and Hezbollah, an allegation they have strongly denied. One of the group, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, has been charged under terrorism laws and is currently on bail.There has been political pressure – including from the prime minister – on festival organisers to drop the band and on the BBC not to broadcast their performance.Asked about the issue, Rothery says: “Our plan is to bring as many of the sets to our audience as we possibly can but obviously we have editorial guidelines, and we need to make sure that any artist on the stage, regardless of who they are, fits within our guidelines and is appropriate for the audience. We have those conversations and make those decisions all the way up to the festival and over the weekend.”Howe and Rothery work closely with festival organisers, including Emily Eavis, months in advance and are privy to the lineup before its general release. With the overwhelming choice on offer, Rothery says, the television and radio package manages to navigate any clashes. “That’s why the live stage streams are super useful. So if you want to curate your own Glastonbury, you can fill your boots.”Howe and her team work closely with the artists to make sure the live performances are represented well on television. “We offer to talk through meetings on – site. At festivals, no one gets a sound check, so a lot is at stake,” she says, en route to a run-through with the Friday night Pyramid stage headliners, the 1975.Jamz Supernova’s hot tips for the weekend includeAlanis Morissette on the Pyramid stage, Ezra Collective on the Other stage, Yussef Dayes and Doechii on the West Holts stage and Anohni and the Johnsons on the Park stage.She holds great respect for the scale of the undertaking, having experienced Glastonbury as a performing DJ and as a reveller and now seeing it from the other side: “All these people, all these nuts and bolts, come together to make it happen. I was so amazed at seeing it through sober eyes. Now I feel like I’m part of the army bringing it, it’s like my mission.”The BBC will cover this year’s Glastonbury festival across TV, BBC iPlayer, radio and BBC SoundsExplore more on these topicsGlastonbury 2025Glastonbury festivaliPlayerBBCTelevision industryMusic festivalsFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Donors are being solicited from Tate’s extensive global supporter network.Tate’s director, Maria Balshaw, said:“There are a number of organisations in the UK that are working hard to create endowments, especially in higher education, but no cultural organisation has done an active campaign like this before.“Many organisations in the arts sector would really like to have this kind of support. If you look to our North American peers, museums like MoMA, the Met or the Whitney all have very significant endowments. It is what protects them from the vagaries of economic change and allows them to think and plan long term.”The fund was announced by Tate’s chair, Roland Rudd, at Tate Modern’s25th anniversaryfundraising gala on Wednesday night, which was attended by more than 600 artists and philanthropists.‘People weep in its presence’: how the UK Aids Memorial Quilt became one of our great works of artRead moreThe gala itself raised more than £1m from table hosts and guests, which will be used to directly support the Tate’s artistic programme, its collection and its learning and educational activities.The gala followed Tate Modern’s anniversary celebrations in May, when more than 76,000 peoplevisitedthe gallery in a single weekend. More than 70% of those who visited were under 35 years old, and 2,000 of them joined Tate Collective, making it the largest arts membership scheme for young people in the world with more than 180,000 members, Tate said.Balshaw said the Tate’s ethics committee helped “advise on every kind of donation that we get”.Other cultural institutions have recently been urged by pro-Palestine supporters to cut ties with Bloomberg Philanthropies over the company’s alleged links to illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian West Bank.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a gay man, it’s a relief to be inMelbourne, where he can be himself. Through Grindr he has met James, once a hookup and now a friend, though Ash still desires him. So he’s on edge when he meets James’s mysterious new boyfriend, Raf – an intimidatingly beautiful Brazilian man who looks like “Jesus in an old oil painting”.Then Ash witnesses Raf committing a violent act at a house party. When tragedy strikes later at a bush doof, it seems this is Raf’s doing, too. Ash tasks himself with investigating all the clues to uncover the truth – a pursuit that becomes his undoing.Thomas Vowles’ debut is a propulsive and gripping psychological thriller that unfurls at first painfully slowly, then begins to quickly unravel, taking readers into truly deranged places. This book left me feeling physically unwell at times but I couldn’t help but peer between my fingers to read on. The author’s background as a screenwriter is evident in the delicious, addictive way his story unfolds, and its taut narrative tension.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAsh is a pitiable character from the outset. When the novel opens, he is anxiously hovering outside a house party. Though he has learned “certain aspects” of how to fit in with the cool, cosmopolitan crowd, such as wearing a silver chain over a plain white T-shirt, he still worries that he will be spotted as an impostor. In the friendly and charismatic James Ash finds someone with whom he can be intimate, even if only emotionally.‘Deliciously addictive’, ‘dripping with suspense’: the best Australian books out in JuneRead moreThrough this nebulous friendship, Vowles demonstrates a deep understanding of the knottiness of Melbourne’s queer scene and how platonic, romantic and sexual relationships can blur. Much of Our New Gods takes place in steamy saunas, claustrophobic and highly charged spaces where anonymous sex offers an escape, and becomes another clue in Ash’s growing arsenal of evidence against Raf. The sauna is a site for communication and miscommunication; sex is both a pleasurable act and a tool.Ash’s narration becomes more unreliable as the story progresses and he sinks deeper into this thorny situation. In one scene, his reality blurs with James’s dreams; in others, his speech becomes erratic and difficult to parse. Vowles develops the character carefully over time, revealing snatches of Ash’s life and backstory, in particular his complicated family relationship – in the sauna, at a point of panic, Ash sees “leering lecherous faces, all of them suddenly my father”. James, too, shares his traumatic father-son memories, in what first seems like bonding between friends or lovers but takes on a more nefarious air as the two men become dangerously intertwined.Though Raf is ostensibly the villain in the story, Vowles cleverly and subtly twists the narrative to cast doubt on all of his characters. James shows a terrifying duplicity that is difficult to pin down; he knows Ash will do anything for him and seems willing to take advantage of that. Ash’s slow descent into madness manifests as a series of delusions – or illusions – which are indistinguishable from reality. Our pity for the character remains steadfast, even when his actions become more unforgivable – he is increasingly desperate and frantic to hold on to what he believes might be the love he’s been waiting for, at any cost.It all makes for a spectacular car crash of a novel that is as compelling as it is challenging, as sickening as it is seductive. Vowles has announced himself with a bang (or many bangs, in every sense of the word) as an audacious new voice in Australian literature – a rare writer who dares to wade deep into the muck to explore the grimy underbelly of modern desire. In his transgression of social and moral niceties, Vowles reveals the ugliness of human nature, with a few flashes of tormented beauty, too.Our New Gods by Thomas Vowlesis out now (UQP, $34.99)Explore more on these topicsBooksAustralian book reviewsFictionAustralian booksThrillersLGBTQ+ rightsMelbourneSexreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jimmy, the protagonist of the Who’s classic album – later a film, now a ballet – brims with awkwardness and scrappy bravado. His hunger for life and his desperation to be someone are viscerally felt when the fantasy of adult life rubs up against the sometimes grubby reality.Should a ballet version of the Who’s 1973 album work? Well it turns out that it does.Pete Townshendmight be the man behind the Who’s sound, but it’s his wife, composer and orchestrator Rachel Fuller, who is in large part responsible for this. She originally orchestrated the album for the Classic Quadrophenia project a decade ago, and that’s the backdrop for this show, minus vocals. The music is majestic, especially the recurring riff from Love, Reign O’er Me that does sterling dramatic work each time it appears and builds to an almighty climax as Jimmy faces crisis after the famous mods and rockers clash on Brighton beach.View image in fullscreenMoves so sharp they sting like a paper cut … Dan Baines as Ace Face, centre.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThis is not a classical ballet, but a dance piece drawing on a number of styles, choreographed by Paul Roberts and directed by Rob Ashford. Roberts is best known from the pop world (Spice Girls, Harry Styles), Ashford from musicals, and they bring a snappy pace to the storytelling, especially in the first act, the narrative based on Townshend’s original liner notes. Paris Fitzpatrick is perfectly cast as disaffected Jimmy, full of tetchy energy, and the four facets of Jimmy’s personality (the “quad” of the title) are represented by different dancers: the swooning Romantic and feral Lunatic, along with the Hypocrite and the Tough Guy, although that’s a device perhaps underused.Jimmy’s apparently uninterested parents are mired in their own troubles and the most poignant choreography comes in an early duet for the couple. Before they even dance, you can sense their dissatisfaction, reluctance and antipathy (in Kate Tydman’s Mother especially), but slowly their defences melt into a tender ballroom hold. The best dancing, however, belongs to the mods in the club scene, all jagged shoulders and jutting chins, moves so sharp they sting like a paper cut.View image in fullscreenCameo … Matthew Ball in Quadrophenia.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRoyalBalletprincipal Matthew Ball is parachuted in for a cameo as an arrogant rock star dressed in Paul Smith union jack jacket. Circling the stage with histours en l’airand pirouettes, he’s got the swagger but it’s all too clean. The following scene though, where Ball sneers at Jimmy and his friends hankering for autographs, is painfully effective. This is a story about false idols (such as king of the mods Ace Face, who turns out to be a lowly hotel bellboy) and it’s about the desperation to belong. That’s mirrored across the generations when Jimmy’s alcoholic dad remembers his wartime service, not only the tragedy but the lost sense of purpose and camaraderie.Smart decisions have been made about the minimal set (by Christopher Oram) and the excellent projections by YeastCulture that make a huge difference to the sense of realism: the condensation on a cafe window, the waves on Brighton seafront. All the pieces fall into place in an engrossing show that has style and substance, grit and grace. It looks like Quadrophenia is a hit once again.AtSadler’s Wells, London, until 13 July.

The surprise in the director’s production of Eugene O’Neill’s final play is that it is served up straight.Frecknall has stepped back to let the play do the speaking but this faithfulness lays bare the datedness of the drama, which creaks with age at times. The production itself seems imbalanced too: glacial in pace, it stretches across three hours, not gathering enough intensity and chugging anti-climactically to its end.Dissolute farmer Phil Hogan (David Threlfall) dreams up a scheme for his daughter, Josie (Ruth Wilson), to seduce the wealthy landlord James Tyrone (Michael Shannon) as a ploy to blackmail him and keep the farm from being sold to a neighbour. So Josie and James spend a moonlit night together, flirting, drinking, arguing and proclaiming love which may or may not be real. An hour in, it feels as if the play is simply circling its plot rather than arriving at its purpose. More than two hours later, Josie and James’s relationship reveals some vulnerability.View image in fullscreenHardscrabble … Ruth Wilson and David Threlfall.Photograph: Marc BrennerWilson is, as always, magnetic in her stage presence, in farm-hand dungarees with the hint of Irishness to her American accent, while Threlfall is convincing as the bullish, wayward father. But characters hover between the roguish, melodramatic and tragic, speaking in scheming monologues which arrest psychological development. Tom Scutt’s set design looks stagnant under a beige wash of timber, planks and ladders, the inside of the farm wall-less but without the intrigue this exposure might bring.As inLong Day’s Journey Into Night(to which this play is a sequel), illusion wrestles with truth, reality and revelation: James is a city type who drinks heavily and reveals deeper, mournful dimensions; Josie has a brazen reputation about town (the “scandal of the countryside”) but one of the mysteries of the plot lies around her sexual virtue. Her story feels oddly – jarringly – eclipsed by James’s outpouring of grief and guilt, along with his glaring madonna/whore fantasy, which shapes their dynamic.Female sexuality as a whole is defined by the men around Josie either as threat or currency with which to bargain for advantage. Josie’s breasts are casually, repeatedly, admired and women are referred to as sluts and pigs. While this may be of its world – an early 20th-century hardscrabble farm community in Connecticut – it gives the play an old-fashioned, queasy feel. The drama ends with what seems like Josie’s transformation into a would-be saviour for the suffering man that James embodies. “Mother me, Josie, I love it,” he says, and she obliges. Is O’Neill suggesting this was Josie’s moral lesson to learn?Perhaps not, but too much of the play creaks with what feel like anachronisms. Frecknall is sometimes charged with being too overbearing a director but this production might have benefited from bigger, bolder revisionism.At theAlmeida theatre, London, until 16 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlmeida theatreEugene O'NeillRebecca FrecknallRuth WilsonMichael ShannonDavid ThrelfallreviewsShareReuse this content"

A message telling fans to meet her at Washington Square Park – ostensibly for a video shoot – caused chaos, happily of the variety that gets filmed on multiple cameraphones and goes viral on social media. Thousands turned up and the police shut the event down, but those that evaded them were eventually rewarded by Lorde performing to new single What Was That with impressive gusto given that she was standing on a small wooden table at the time.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Virgin.It was surprising. Lorde’s last release, 2021’sSolar Power, wasn’t the only album of that period on which a female artist who had become famous in her teens strongly suggested that doing so was a living nightmare – Billie Eilish’s Happier Than Ever and Olivia Rodrigo’s Guts did, too – but it was the only one that sounded like a resignation letter, sent from a beach in Ella Yelich-O’Connor’s native New Zealand: “Won’t take a call if it’s the label or the radio,” she sang at one point. At another: “If you’re looking for a saviour, well that’s not me.” But Solar Power turned out to be merely an out-of-office message. Four years on and Lorde isn’t just back, but apparently back in the sharp-eyed party girl mode of 2017’sMelodrama. What Was That compares falling in love to the sensation of smoking while on MDMA. “It’s a beautiful life, so why play truant?” she shrugs on opener Hammer. “I jerk tears and they pay me to do it.”The album features electronics that chatter, throb and regularly burst into fat, rave-y hands-in-the-air riffs, a high proportion of bangers to ballads and a profusion of big choruses. The ballads tend to the epic rather than introspective, with even Broken Glass, the track about the singer’s battle with an eating disorder, packing a hook you can imagine a stadium audience singing along to. In that sense, Virgin might seem like an act of consolidation – far closer to Melodrama, since hailed as a modern classic, than the understated and polarising Solar Power. But it seems infinitely more likely that Lorde has reappeared because she’s got something fresh to say rather than to reassert her commercial pop bona fides.Despite the talk of pills, dancing and promiscuity, Virgin’s overall tone is markedly different. Melodrama was an album concerned with events that happen in your late teens, from experiments with drugs to first major heartbreak. Eight years on, Virgin is haunted by a late-20s kind of angst, born of the sense that you’re now incontrovertibly an adult, regardless of whether you feel like one, or whether you’re still, as GRWM puts it, “jumping from stone to stone in the riverbed … looking for a grown woman”. On Shapeshifter, a one-night stand brings ennui and an irrational fear that such behaviour is compulsive: “If I’m fine without it, why can’t I stop?”Lorde: What Was That – videoThere’s more heartbreak, but this time it’s sharpened by the sense that the sundered relationship was meant to betherelationship: the album ends with Lorde repeating the phrase “am I ever gonna love again?”, a sentiment that also lurks around Man of the Year, Current Affairs and What Was That. It’s worth noting that the fraught subject matter is invariably leavened with self-awareness and bursts of sharp wit. On Current Affairs, a romantic depiction of love blossoming under a lunar eclipse suddenly turns earthy: “You tasted my underwear / I knew we were fucked.”Girl, so inspiring! Lorde’s 20 best songs – rankedRead moreSimilarly, despite the choruses and the euphoric riffs, the sound of Virgin is noticeably unsettled and rough. The synths are distorted in a way that makes the resultant sound feel corroded; the more ambient textures tend to gust through the songs like drafts of icy air. The melody lines are regularly disrupted by bursts of incomprehensible, mangled vocals that suddenly appear then vanish. The biggest ballad, Man of the Year, builds to a climax that’s less uplifting than panic-inducing: the weirdly clipped-sounding drums feel too loud, punching through everything else in irregular staccato bursts; the aforementioned distortion soaks everything, including the vocals; the electronics take on a punishing, industrial cast.Throughout, Lorde seems less like an artist cravenly rehashing former glories than one who began her career speaking directly to her fellow teens about stuff that mattered to them – and paving the way for Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo et al in the process – continuing to grow up alongside her fans. That’s always a tough job, but one Lorde seems more than capable of thanks to writing that remains as skilful and incisive as it did when she was precociously skewering pop’s obsession with unattainable lifestyles from an Auckland suburb in 2013. Powerful, moving, personal but universal – and packed with bangers – Virgin is the proof.This week Alexis listened toWestside Cowboy – Alright Alright AlrightA brief, frantic, bracing burst of chaotic, Pavement-ish alt-rock: feedback, guitar riffs that unravel into chaos, all over and done in just over 90 seconds.Explore more on these topicsLordeAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockElectronic musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Now she adds a disc of more sonatas by arguably the most important baroque composer for the violin after JS Bach – five of the collection of eight that Biber published in 1681, as well as the quasi-theatrical Sonata Representivo, which may or may not have been composed by Biber and probably dates from 1669.The pieces are all characterised by their extreme technical difficulty, and especially by their extensive use of scordatura, when individual violin strings are tuned differently from usual. Podger copes with all these challenges quite brilliantly, including imitating the sounds of animals in the Sonata Representivo; she brings an expressive freedom that never takes too many liberties, but remains true to the spirit of the music. If the works themselves are not quite as startling and vivid as the Rosary Sonatas, anyone who enjoyed Podger’s previous encounter with Biber will surely relish this one, too.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

But as well as being an academic and conductor, Bantock was a prolific composer, with a work list including four symphonies, five concertos and nine operas, of which the last, the “Celtic folk opera” The Seal Woman, is easily the best remembered now.View image in fullscreenThe premiere of The Seal Woman in 1924 was the Birmingham Repertory theatre’s first production; librettist Marjory Kennedy-Fraser took the main role of the Cailleach, whose dreams and visions tell the story of the Selkie, seal-people who emerge from the sea every seven years to live on land, shedding their skins to take human form.Kennedy-Fraser’s text is a patchwork of 24 folk songs that she collected in the Western Isles, and originally she intended it as a spoken drama. Even in the operatic version, the songs remain central; Bantock’s music, for an instrumental ensemble of 16 players, tactfully wraps itself around the original melodies, never dominating, and preserving as much of the integrity of Kennedy-Fraser’s accompaniments as possible.Dramatically, though, it remains inert. Although the original melodies and some of the texts as Kennedy-Fraser presents them have their own intrinsic beauty, The Seal Woman comes across as rather faded, dated and uninvolving. That’s despite the best efforts of conductor John Andrews and a carefully assembled cast of singers, led by Yvonne Howard as the storytelling Cailleach and mezzo Catherine Carby as the Seal Woman herself. But it’s the curiosity value of the score that recommends it above all.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Blending romance, pulpy sci-fi and family drama, it opens with octogenarian Iris Chase Griffen recalling the moment she was told her sister, Laura, had driven off a bridge. The police inform her that two people witnessed Laura deliberately swerve off the road. Though Iris believes this to be true, she insists to the officers that it was an accident.We go on to hear about Iris’s privileged upbringing and marriage of convenience to Richard Griffen, the wealthy owner of a button factory, and her estrangement from her granddaughter with whom she hopes to reconcile. The book also contains excerpts from Laura’s posthumously published novel which features clandestine romantic encounters between an unnamed man – seemingly a fugitive – and a wealthy woman. During their trysts, they concoct a wild fable about life on a distant planet. All this is interspersed with newspaper items reporting on the lives of the Chases and Griffins over 60 years.This is one of a series of new audio recordings of Atwood novels made exclusively with Canadian actors; others include Alias Grace, Cat’s Eye, The Robber Bride and the Oryx and Crake trilogy. The Blind Assassin comes with three narrators: Emma Love reads the novel-within-a-novel; David Attar delivers the newspaper reports; and Jennifer Higgin is the inscrutable, complex Iris whose actions are a puzzle to be decoded. “You want the truth of course,” she says, addressing the listener. “You want me to put two and two together. But two and two doesn’t necessarily get you the truth.”Available via Little, Brown Audio, 23hr 2minFurther listeningWhen the GoingWas GoodGraydon Carter, WF Howes, 12hr 29minThe former Vanity Fair editor documents his star-studded career in magazine publishing.

FromGougane Barra, where a tiny chapel sits at the lake’s edge, the road winds through old rebel country, into deep forests where foxgloves bloom along the mountainside.Bantry House– a magnificent estate overlooking a lovely bay – marked our path toward Ballydehob, West Cork’s boho village just north of the Mizen Head peninsula.Ireland mapIt’s a suitably impressive setting for Native, a new off-grid eco-guesthouse just a stone’s throw from the village. The brainchild of Didi Ronan (who previously worked in public policy and the music industry) and husband Simon (who runs the sustainable landscape architect studioSRLA), the aim was to create somewhere that has a positive impact on both the environment and local community.Previously a derelict farmhouse, the chic three-bedroom B&B, set in beautiful gardens, celebrates Ireland’s craft heritage, too. From the communal living room – with its art books and antique maps – to the timber-clad garden sauna, every element is carefully considered. The bedrooms lean into a modern-meets-vernacular aesthetic, with muted tones and tactile textures. Ours opens on to a private patio, and above the bed are hundreds of vintage National Geographic magazines – collected by Didi’s grandmother – arranged in artful symmetry across a bespoke bookshelf.View image in fullscreenDidi and Simon Ronan are investing part of the profits from their Native guesthouse to rewild the nearby landOver dinner, a delicate crab risotto with fresh farm greens (evening meals, booked in advance, are intimate home-cooked affairs), the couple share their vision. Sparked by a flash of clarity Simon had while designing high-end eco-resorts in the Maldives, when the true cost of tourism on Indigenous land and ecology became unavoidable, they began dreaming of a new kind of hospitality. “Could a hotel not only tread lightly, but also give back to the land?” they wondered.Sustainability is baked into the whole project, from the build to what they do with their profits. Instead of conventional plaster, Didi chose hemp – a more natural alternative – while Simon ensured that every existing material was reused, from the original foundations to the retaining walls. Two new cabins opening this summer aim to be the “gold standard in sustainable architecture”, made of local timber, hemp and wood wool fibre. A newly restored barn will open as a creative hub for workshops, natural wine tastings, and collaborations with foragers and craftspeople, too.View image in fullscreenThe style of Native is modern meets vernacular, with muted tones, tactile textures and sustainability at its core.Photograph: Kate Bean Photography/PRBut perhaps most impressive of all is that 20% of Native’s profits go directly to their 75-acre rewilding site nearby – a living laboratory of native tree planting, invasive species removal, and ecological education. Guests are encouraged to visit – and the next day we drive 10 minutes along winding roads and walk across fields, their dog, Peig, darting ahead through rushes and briars, to learn more. “First, you eradicate invasive species. Then you conserve what you have, protect it from overgrazing, and then plant native trees to help things along,” Simon says.At the ridge, the land opens into a sweep of sea and scattered islands. Below us lies Roaringwater Bay; behind, the skeletal remains of an old cottage clings to the earth. Didi gestures toward a patch of young trees. “The problem is huge – biodiversity, climate – but the solution’s simple: trees, wetlands, space.”The aim behind Native was to create somewhere that has a positive impact on both the environment and local communityWe carry on down towards an artificial lake, where dragonflies hover and moorhens skitter through the reeds. There we meetSam Keane, a coastal forager and artist who runs immersive coastal tours guests can book, unlocking the powers of the sea, and demonstrating the tastes and powerful healing properties of seaweed and other ocean plant life.Native is just a short stroll from the heart of Ballydehob, a village of just a few hundred but with plenty of pubs, and later that day I wander the pretty streets, soaking up a different kind of energy: human, social, alive. It’s a place that over-delivers, not in size but in spirit. AtLevis Corner Housethe Wednesday market spills out on to the street. The heart of a thriving community, Levis is a pub, concert venue that hosts live performances from behind the old shop counter, and essentially a welcoming village living room.View image in fullscreenLevis Corner House in Ballydehob is a pub, a concert venue and food market – essentially ‘a village living room’There’s a lively art scene here too. The late potters Christa Reichel and Nora Golden helped found the local craft movement in the 1970s, still seen in venues likeThe Working Artist Studioson Main Street, and in the homegrown ceramics, textiles and artisan food shops crammed between colourful pub fronts and gable-end murals.It’s a village that’s hard to leave, but the next day I set out to explore the area further. A 12-arch viaduct from the old rail line arcs across the estuary at the town’s edge. Pastel shop fronts curl along the hill. The 17th-century Butter Road leads from Ballydehob to Schull, a bright little harbour village. I stop and follow a walking trail through green lanes and quiet country roads, a soft scenic route, edged by hedgerows and sea glimpses, once used to carry churns of West Cork butter to market.From here, Mizen Head begins, a tapering peninsula where the past is never far away. A Neolithic portal tomb lies accessible, close to the roadside overlooking the bay. I follow a path to Three Castle Head. Fields give way to a wide sweep of jagged coastline, steep tufty hills rising and falling in tandem with the Atlantic. The hike climbs gradually, then steeply,and the ruins of three weather-beaten towers, 15th-century remnants of a defensive castle on a limestone ridge, come into view. From a distance, they seem almost grown from the rock itself, overlooking an indigo bay cupped in a lush green valley. Back in the car, the road dips and rises again towardMizen Head Signal Station,mainland Ireland’s most southwesterly point. The footbridge to Fastnet signal station arches across sheer cliffs, a solid span above the Atlantic, cinematic in scale.Sustainability is only part of the story – regeneration is the next stepDidi RonanThat evening, back in Ballydehob, I discoverChestnut, a Michelin-starred restaurant, where former pub walls now host a dining room led by chef Rob Krawczyk. His tasting menu captures the season with clear flavours: preserved, foraged and grown. Everything is impeccable and in keeping with the narrative I’ve uncovered in this progressive, ecologically minded, quietly radical corner of West Cork. As Didi put it, “Sustainability is only part of the story – regeneration is the next step.”The trip was provided byNative.

I write these columns just over two weeks in advance, so I need Met Office/clairvoyant weather prediction skills to work out what it is we’re likely to be drinking by the time the column comes out. But I’m going to go out on a limb here and declare that summer will be here when you read this. No, don’t look out of the window. Keep looking at your phone screen, and imagine the sun’s beating down outside. That calls for a chilled red, right?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The types of red wine that fare best when chilled are those that are fruity, youthful and not too tannic. Thepunching downorpumping overof a wine can extract tannins from the skins, pips and stalks. Often confused with the mouth-puckering effect of acidity, the best way I can describe the sensation of tannins is it’s a bit like when you drink the last dregs of a cup of green tea: it tastes all stemmy and dry, and you can feel where you’ve been biting the inside of your cheeks.“In hot and sweaty Barcelona, we serve all our reds at between 11C and 12C,” says Benji Sher, owner and sommelier at the city’sFluidwine bar. “That’s definitely too cold for the super-tannic bangers, but I’d rather things slowly warm up in the glass. Better to be too cold than too hot.”“A cold wine is more a thing to drink and less a thing to savour,” saysJ Lee, a New York-based food writer whose semi-anonymous musings on flavour I trust disproportionately considering I’ve never met him. “I think the way we’re consuming wine is becoming more casual,” he says. “A cold wine is never so serious, and most other beverages that people drink casually are served cold: beer, cocktails,White Claw… I’m looking forward to ice cubes in wine coming back.”Perhaps that is the logical next step for those among us who want our reds to remain chilled all summer long? I have to confess, popping an ice cube in my wine glass isn’t something I’ve yet tried for fear that it will dilute the wine, and therefore my drinking experience, which doesn’t bear thinking about. But then I think of my beloved iced coffee. Not only is this apparently the reason I’ll never own a house, but it’s also something I suck up so ravenously quickly that the fact that the ice may dilute the coffee doesn’t even cross my mind. Perhaps that’s the thing: something as simple and delicious as a chilled red needn’t concern itself with the heat. By the time the ice would have melted, it’ll already be in your belly.
