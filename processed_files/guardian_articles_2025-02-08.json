It follows new evidence that thousands of people who want to work are worried about taking steps to return to the workplace out of fear that their benefits will be withdrawn.“The Tories promised to get people off benefits and into work,” said a government source. “But instead they created a system that trapped and wrote people off and left them without help and support.“ThisLabourgovernment will fix the broken benefits system because getting more people into good jobs is crucial to improving their living standards and life chances, and getting the welfare bill on a more sustainable footing.”Under the current system, those deemed too sick to work receive a higher payment than those deemed either able to work or able to do some work. Those unable to work at all receive an extra £416 a month. Those well enough to do at least some work used to receive an extra £156 a month, but that payment was scrapped for new claimants in 2017.Meanwhile, the higher level of support has continued to increase during a long period in which basic benefits were frozen. Ministers believe that these two factors have driven more people into the group not working at all – and fear many of them have been left there without enough help.View image in fullscreenThe Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is meeting welfare experts to try to build support for reforms.Photograph: Thomas Krych/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockThe employment minister Alison McGovern described it recently as the “greatest unemployment challenge of a generation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cuts eventually amounting to £1.3bn a year are set to be introduced from April, while manyLabour MPs are suspicious of anything seen as a raid on welfare. Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, is already understood to be meeting disability groups and other welfare experts in an attempt to build support for a fundamental redrawing of the benefits system. Proposals for an overhaul will be unveiled in the spring, when a lengthy consultation will begin.Officials point to a new survey carried out by the government that found 200,000 people claiming health and disability benefits who said they would be ready to work if the right job or support were available. Half of those surveyed said that one of the barriers to finding a job was the worry that they would lose their benefits if they moved into work and it did not work out.Insiders also think the work capability assessment, currently used to approve incapacity benefits, is “too broken” and needs to be scrapped. They also believe that there has been a complete failure to keep in touch with those currently deemed too sick to work and believe that there is mounting evidence that even the simplest conversations with work coaches can have a positive impact.This comes with the Treasury desperate to make savings from the welfare bill as the chancellor Rachel Reeves tries to avoid breaching her own fiscal rules, which are already tight. The legal cap on welfare will be breached by more than £8bn this financial year.While reforms are being welcomed, there are already warnings that they will take time and, done fairly, are unlikely to deliver big savings. “I don’t think anybody thinks that the health and disability benefits system works well at the moment,” said Lindsay Judge, research director at the Resolution Foundation. “It doesn’t work well for claimants. It’s costing the exchequer a lot of money.You can envisage a better system. But to make that kind of wholesale change is a long-term project, and it requires reconfiguring the relationship between the department and claimants. It’s really hard to see how the government could do that if its initial foray into this field is to make quite significant cuts.“The basic rate of benefits is so low – it has been eroded away. So getting incapacity benefits is a significant boost and passports you into things like carers’ allowance and away from conditionality. As the system has become more restrictive, there have been more advantages for people to claim that benefit. It would be wrong to say that it’s the only reason we’re seeing more people on the higher rate of incapacity benefits, but it is clearly a contributory factor.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareThe ObserverBenefitsDisabilityLabourConservativesUniversal creditnewsShareReuse this content"

So how did Facebook know where we’d been?Shanti DasandJon Ungoed-ThomasSat 8 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 13.13 ESTShareGambling companies are covertly tracking visitors to their websites and sending their data to Facebook’s parent company without consent in an apparent breach of data protection laws.The information is then being used by Facebook’s owner,Meta, to profile people as gamblers and flood them with ads for casinos and betting sites, theObservercan reveal. A hidden tracking tool embedded in dozens of UK gambling websites has been extracting visitors’ data – including details of the webpages they view and the buttons they click – and sharing it with the social media company.By law, data should only be used and shared for marketing purposes, with explicit permission obtained from users on the websites in which the tools are embedded. But testing by theObserverof 150 gambling sites – including virtual casinos, sports betting sites and online bingo – found widespread breaches of the rules.This weekend, Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative chair of the all-party parliamentary group on gambling reform, called for an “immediate intervention”. He said: “The use of tools such as Meta Pixel without explicit consent seems wholly in breach of the law and should be immediately stopped. The gambling industry’s marketing practices are now out of control, and our regulatory structure and codes of practice are repeatedly shown to be inadequate. This cannot go on.”We didn’t click ‘consent’ on any gambling website. So how did Facebook know where we’d been?Read moreWolfie Christl, a data privacy expert who has investigated thead tech industry, said: “Sharing data with Meta is highly problematic, even with consent, but doing so without explicit informed consent shows a blatant disregard for the law.“Meta is complicit and must be held accountable. It benefits from facilitating problematic and unlawful data practices for its clients and systematically looks the other way, using its terms and conditions as a shield rather than seriously enforcing them.”View image in fullscreenBet442 was among the gambling companies that transmitted data via the Meta Pixel tracking tool without explicit permission.Of 150 websites tested by theObserver, 52 shared data automatically via the Meta Pixel tracking tool without explicit consent, according to analysis of network traffic. The sites found to have transmitted data to Facebook without permission included Hollywoodbets, Sporting Index, Bwin, Lottoland, 10Bet and Bet442.The data transfer happened automatically on loading the webpage, before the person clicked to agree or decline marketing. At no point during the testing did the reporter agree to the use of their data for marketing.In the days afterwards, they were bombarded with Facebook ads for gambling websites, indicating that they had been profiled by Meta as someone interested in gambling as a result of the unlawful data sharing.In a single browsing session, they were shown gambling ads from 49 brands – not just websites that had shared their data unlawfully, but others too. This included betting companies that were unaware of the unlawful data sharing and whose own use of Meta Pixel was within the rules – among them, Ladbrokes, Sky Bet, BetVictor, Tombola and Bet365 - as well as dozens of smaller brands.The offers included free bets, a “new players offer” with a 200% bonus and a “gold blitz” with the chance to “win up to 5,000 times your bet”.Details of the data sharing and profiling come amid calls for a wider investigation into targeting of gamblers. In September, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)issued a reprimandto Bonne Terre Ltd, trading as Sky Betting & Gaming, for unlawfully processing people’s data through advertising cookies without their consent. The brand said at the time it regretted a “technical error”, which had been rectified.As theObserverreported last week, in a separate case, Sky Betting & Gaming collected hundreds of thousands of pieces of data about a problem gambler who was sent more than 1,300 marketing emails. The high court found the data use unlawful, ruling that the compulsive nature of the man’s gambling meant his ability to give consent was impaired. The company said it had made significant changes since the claimant’s experience in 2017-19 but “fundamentally disagrees” with the ruling and is considering an appeal.TheGamblingCommission has announced measures to prohibit cross-selling, where companies target existing customers with ads for other parts of their business. But there is nothing to prevent brands relying on profiling by third parties such as Meta to try to recruit new customers.Meta did not comment on theObserver’sfindings but pointed to its terms and conditions, which stipulate that companies should obtain consent before sending it data. “We educate advertisers on properly setting up business tools,” a spokesperson said.The Liberal Democrat peerDon Foster, chair of Peers for Gambling Reform, said: “It is critical that gambling companies and online platforms act lawfully, and it is concerning to see evidence of continued unlawful practices.” Prof Heather Wardle, a gambling research specialist at Glasgow University, said: “This kind of untamed marketing is hugely risky. If you are already experiencing difficulties from gambling, it is likely to make you gamble more.”TheObserverhaspreviously reported on the misuse of Meta Pixelin other sectors, including by NHS trusts that were inadvertently sharing sensitive health data. The ICO said last year that it was conducting a “wide-ranging review” of tracking pixels, which must be used “fairly, lawfully and transparently”, and that it would “not hesitate” to take enforcement action if needed, which can include fines of up to £500,000. “Too often, there is a lack of accountability for how these tools collect and use people’s personal information, with poor transparency and deceptive design,” a spokesperson said.After being contacted by theObserver, several gambling operators updated their websites to prevent automatic data sharing – or removed the Meta Pixel tool altogether.One betting brand, Bwin, a previous sponsor of Real Madrid and the Uefa Europa League, shared data on people visiting a promotional page for a £20 free bet. The data sharing happened automatically on loading the website, without the person being asked for consent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are deeply committed to ensuring that personal data is handled appropriately and have taken immediate action to rectify the issue.”Twenty-six websites operating under the licence of gambling group AG Communications appeared to be sharing data with Meta automatically and without explicit consent, including Bet442, King Casino, 666 Casino and 24Spin. A representative said it took compliance with its obligations extremely seriously.View image in fullscreenGambling company Hollywoodbets shared data with Meta despite not being given consent to do so.Another company, Hollywoodbets, which sponsors Premier League club Brentford, showed website visitors a consent banner telling them that it shared data with its “social media, advertising and analytics partners” – and giving them the option to “allow all”.But theObserver’stesting found that even if the person did not click accept, data was shared with Meta, including details of which pages they viewed and the buttons they clicked.The person was subsequently shown Facebook ads for Hollywoodbets, and Meta’s activity logs showed that data had been received from the website. A representative of Hollywoodbets said it complied with all regulatory requirements but declined to comment further.‘Woeful’ DfE blamed as betting firms gain access to children’s dataRead moreLottoland, which says it has 20 million customers, declined to comment. Its website includes a banner that appears to give people the option to “accept all” or “reject nonessential” tracking. But theObserver’stesting found that it sent data to Meta before the website visitor had indicated their choice.Sporting Index and 10Bet did not respond to comment requests.The Betting and Gaming Council, which represents the industry, said: “Advertising must comply with strict guidelines, and safer gambling messaging is regularly and prominently displayed. The previous government stated that research did not establish a causal link between exposure to advertising and the development of problem gambling.”The Gambling Commission, which regulates betting companies, said: “Operators may only collect and use data to attract custom in ways that are lawful and in compliance with data protection legislation, and their focus should be on preventing gambling harm. Questions around data protection are a matter for the ICO.”Flutter, which owns several brands that served ads on Facebook but did not share data with Meta unlawfully, said it had “acted appropriately and gained consent at all times”.Bet365 declined to comment but is understood to deny setting up marketing campaigns that specifically target users of other gambling websites.

Afrikaners are descended mainly from the Dutch, who began colonisingSouth Africain 1652, as well as French Huguenot refugees sponsored by the Dutch.More than three decades after white minority rule ended, South Africa remains hugely unequal, with land and wealth still largely concentrated among white people, who make up 7% of the population, about half native Afrikaans speakers, while black people are 81%.However, some white South Africansclaim they are discriminated against, often citing the country’s affirmative action laws.Trump’s executiveorder, signed on Friday, said there were “countless government policies designed to dismantle equal opportunity in employment, education, and business, and hateful rhetoric and government actions fuelling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners”.It added: “In addition, South Africa has taken aggressive positions towards the United States and its allies, including accusing Israel, not Hamas, of genocide in the international court of justice, and reinvigorating its relations with Iran to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.”Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire leading Trump’s efforts to slash the size of US government, including foreign aid spending, has criticised South Africa on his social media platform, X, for what he claimed were “openly racist policies”.South Africa’s foreign ministry said in astatementthat there seemed to be a “campaign of misinformation and propaganda”.“It is ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged, while vulnerable people in the US from other parts of the world are being deported and denied asylum despite real hardship,” it said. “We reiterate that South Africa remains committed to finding diplomatic solutions to any misunderstandings or disputes.”Conservative Afrikaner pressure groups said they were concerned about US aid to South Africa being cut and that South Africa would be excluded from the African Growth and Opportunity Act.The act is US legislation that needs to be renewed by the US Congress this year, which allows South African exporters, including farmers, to sell thousands of products to the US tariff-free.“This is indeed a crisis,” said Kallie Kriel, the CEO of Afriforum, which describes itself as a civil rights group for Afrikaners, but has been accused of racism. “If somebody is to blame it is the president and senior ANC [African National Congress party] leaders.”“We want to also show appreciation to President Trump … for recognising and identifying the discrimination that Afrikaners are experiencing through racial legislation … through threats to property rights,” Kriel told a press conference, adding: “We became a people here, we are Indigenous people in this country and we are going nowhere.”Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaTrump administrationCyril RamaphosaDonald TrumpElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

I felt sick in the stomach. It’s a band you’ll never experience or see again and it’s been on my bucket list for years. It just feels like my dreams have been completely crushed.”She said each ticket cost about £150 while a hotel stay cost £200 a person and a further £40 for travel.Marta Bonnet, a fan from Spain, said she spent more than £3,000 for herself, her husband and two teenage children to see Oasis at Wembley and received the same email on Friday.She initially thought the email was fake, but after realising it was from Ticketmaster she said she does not intend to buy tickets from the company in the future, despite being a loyal customer.Bonnet, 48, a lawyer from Tenerife, said: “At first we thought this email was fake or a spam email, but no, it was true.“We usually use Ticketmaster to buy our tickets … But now, how can I trust this page, which is supposed to be the official page? I really can’t believe what has happened.”Bonnet managed to buy four premium tickets for just more than £1,000 last August and spent about £2,082 (€2,000) on accommodation and flights, but said it is unlikely she will be refunded for her plane tickets.A spokesperson from Ticketmaster said: “Anyone who has been contacted and believes a refund was made in error has been sent a form to fill in for the tour’s promoters to review.”The Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigationinto Ticketmaster in September regarding the sale of Oasis tickets, including so-called dynamic pricing.Ticketmaster said at the time it does not set concert prices and its website states this is down to the “event organiser” who “has priced these tickets according to their market value”.PA Media contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsTicketmasterOasisnewsShareReuse this content"

The bout was stopped in the ninth round and Cooney had subsequently undergone surgery after it was discovered he had an intracranial haemorrhage. The bout was his first defence of the Celtic super-featherweight title.A further statement was posted on Saturday night by Dunlop on behalf of the Cooney family, confirming that the boxer had died after a “week of battling for his life”.It read: “It is with complete devastation that we have to announce that after a week of battling for his life John Cooney has sadly passed away. Mr and Mrs Cooney and his fiancee Emmaleen would like to thank the staff at Belfast’s Royal Victoria hospital who have worked tirelessly to save John’s life and for everyone who has sent messages of support and prayers.“He was a much loved son, brother and partner and it will take us all a lifetime to forget how special he was. RIP John ‘the Kid’ Cooney.”Cooney won the title with a win over Liam Gaynor in Dublin in November 2023 but spent a year out of the ring with a hand injury. He returned in October with a victory over Tampela Maharusi.Explore more on these topicsBoxingIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

The Liberal Democrats are on 11% and the Greens 8%. Reform has risen from about 20% in Opinium’s polling shortly after the general election, while the other two main parties have fallen back.Among those who are backing Reform, the poll found that 37% say they do so because of its hardline policies on immigration and border controls.Separately, among people who are “Reform considerers” (thinking about backing the party), about 72% said they were doing so because of the party’s immigration and borders policies. This is more than twice the percentage cited for any other policy issue. Roughly 36% cited Reform UK’s anti-EU stance as the main reason for considering backing the party.At last summer’s general election two of Reform UK’s five main policy pledges were to do with migration. It said it would freeze non-essential immigration, with exceptions only for essential healthcare workers.On the issue of small boats smuggling migrants across the Channel, the party said it would “pick up illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France”, and added that “zero illegal migrants” would be resettled in the UK.The poll also shows disastrous falls in Keir Starmer’s personal ratings since the general election. His rating for being “in touch with ordinary people” has fallen from +4% in June last year to -34%. His rating for “representing what ordinary people think” has plummeted from +1% to -39%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They included apparent antisemitic remarks and demeaning comments about Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister.Gwynne, 50, is alleged to have made the comments in aWhatsAppmessaging group with other local party figures.Keir Starmer sacked Gwynne on Saturday after his party was presented with the messages by the Mail on Sunday.A government spokesperson said: “The prime minister is determined to uphold high standards of conduct in public office and lead a government in the service of working people. He will not hesitate to take action against any minister who fails to meet these standards, as he has in this case.”The Gorton and Denton MP’s alleged messages include one in which he joked that he hoped a 72-year-old woman would soon die after contacting her Labour councillor about her bins.“As you have been re-elected, I thought it would be an appropriate time to contact you with regard to the bin collections,” she wrote.When the letter from the resident was shared in the WhatsApp group, Gwynne wrote a suggested response: “Dear resident, fuck your bins. I’m re-elected and without your vote. Screw you. PS: Hopefully you’ll have croaked it by the all-outs.”His reference to “all-outs” refers to local council elections in which the whole local authority is up for election. In many cases, only a third of a council faces elections each year.Among the other messages, Gwynne is alleged to have said someone “sounds too Jewish” and “too militaristic” from their name. He also asked: “Is he in Mossad?”He is also said to have made comments about both Diane Abbott, the veteran Labour MP, and Rayner.In 2019 in the WhatsApp group, called Trigger Me Timbers, Gwynne is alleged to have said support for Abbott’s historic appearance as a black woman at prime minister’s questions was a “joke”, apparently adding that her appearance was “because it’s Black History Month apparently”.In March 2021, when Rayner faced criticism for claiming wireless headphones on parliamentary expenses, Gwynne reposted a tweet by a so-called parody account that referred to the incident and related it to a sex act.Gwynne said on Saturday evening: “I deeply regret my badly misjudged comments and apologise for any offence I’ve caused.“I entirely understand the decisions the PM and the party have taken and, while very sad to have been suspended, will support them in any way I can.”A Labour spokesperson said: “Andrew Gwynne has been administratively suspended as a member of the Labour party. We are investigating comments made in this WhatsApp group in line with the Labour party’s rules and procedures.“Swift action will be taken if individuals are found to have breached the high standards expected of them as Labour party members.”Explore more on these topicsLabourHealthWhatsAppnewsShareReuse this content"

The couple had moved to south-west France from Scotland about 10 years ago.Scottish-born actor Callum Kerr, 30, who played PC George Kiss in the Channel 4 soap, shared a statement on Instagram. It said: “At this time, Callum Kerr, Amanda Kerr, Tom Searle & Ella Searle are grieving the tragic loss of their mother and father, Dawn and Andrew Searle. No family member is available for media interviews or comments.“We kindly request that their privacy be respected during this difficult period. We will provide updates as appropriate.”Kerr has appeared in Netflix’s Virgin River and has released a number of country songs.Kerr walked his mother down the aisle when she married Searle at a ceremony in France. On social media, he said: “Not many people can say they walked their own mother down the aisle. What a pleasure. I love you, mum.”According to local media, Dawn was found outside the property with a serious head injury and jewellery around her. She was reportedly found by a neighbour, who thought she was unconscious and called emergency services.When police, accompanied by a helicopter, a drone, criminal investigation technicians and a forensic doctor, arrived at the property, they discovered Andrew Searle dead. Police say they have reached no conclusion and are keeping an open mind about the deaths.“Both died violent deaths, but I cannot establish that either was a homicide. All hypotheses remain open,” the public prosecutor, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said on Friday. Rigot-Muller told the BBC autopsies will begin on Monday.A spokesperson for the UK’s Foreign Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British couple who died in France and are liaising with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But this is something newRobert FordReform has surged in the polls, panicking both Labour and the Conservatives. It’s a trap, and the risks are highSat 8 Feb 2025 12.08 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 16.56 ESTShareNigel Farage is making trouble again. Reform, his latest political vehicle, has surged in the polls, moving into first place with some pollsters, and ruffling feathers on Labour back benches.The Farage effect: why Keir Starmer is styling Labour as the ‘disruptors’Read moreWhile Farage has caused headaches for every prime minister since David Cameron, his recent rise is something new. Reform scored an average of almost 25% in January polls, past the peaks achieved by Ukip or theBrexitparty in earlier parliaments. And while past Farage surges were spikes driven by circumstances – European parliament elections, the EU referendum, the collapse of Theresa May’s ­government – the current rise is more sustained. This Farage boom is no bubble.Something else is new. While earlier Farage parties lagged well behind the traditional parties of government, the current polls show a three-way tie between Reform, Labour and theConservatives, all on roughly 25%, with the final quarter of the vote going to smaller left and liberal parties.The electoral scene is more fragmented than ever, and this fragmentation has dramatically increased Reform’s disruptive capacity.Neither Ukip nor the Brexit party were credible local threats in many seats, but the current splintered polling takes us into the zone of maximum electoral chaos where Farage is one threat among many, and even small fluctuations in supportcould have dramatic effects.The Farage threat is strategic for Labour, but for theConservatives it is existential. Seven months on from their worst-ever general ­election result, the Tories are still going backwards. In the latest Opinium poll, the Conservatives lose one in six of their 2024 voters to Reform, while one in three of their 2019 ­supporters now back Farage’s party.Recovery in opposition will depend on convincing unhappy voters that the Conservatives are the only credible alternative. But every Reform poll lead brings us closer to the point where Farage can turn the tables, convincing discontented ­voters thatReform UKis the most ­viable opposition contender, and engineering a further, and perhaps terminal, Tory decline.Every poll lead brings us closer to the point where Farage can turn the tables, convincing voters that Reform is the most viable oppositionWhile Reform clearly hit the Tories hardest nationally, Farage’s overall impact on the electoral map is messier and harder to gauge. With voters more splintered than ever, national polling becomes un­reliable as even a rough guide to first-past-the-post contests where local dynamics could tip the balance in hundreds of seats.AsLabourshowed us last July, where you win matters more than how many you win. If patterns of support remain constant, then geography still favours Labour and the Conservatives, and hampers Reform, when all three parties are polling in the 20s. But it would be a brave strategist indeed who assumed such stability in today’s volatile context.How voters understand and respond to changing local conditions is now the central question for every party. Tactical co-ordination among Conservative and Reform voters would drastically amplify the electoral threat to Labour and the Liberal Democrats. But a Tory push into radical right terrain could make them unacceptable to otherwise winnable liberal professional voters, with the spectre of Farage boosting anti-Conservative local campaigns.If Reform’s rise continues, in­cumbents from all the mainstream parties could make gains if the large cohort of voters who strongly oppose Farage become willing to back whoever can stop his local candidate. Such local dynamics are hard to predict from national polls, because they involve changes which only emerge once an election is close and voters’ minds turn to the local contest.Election day is a long way off yet, but the Labour MPs representing the 89 seats where Farage’s party came second last July are already worried about how that local dynamic is going to play out. And it is these MPs who are, understandably, making the most noise about the need for aLabour response to the threat posed by Farage and Reform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is an alienated voter group, with little affection and less trust for the Labour government, and a strong preference for Reform on issues such as immigration.Voting intention chartA knee-jerk response to Reform also squanders one of the great advantages of government: the power to set the agenda. Labour won last summer with a ruthless focus on issues which united a broad coalition – growth, public services and the cost of living. Focusing instead on issues which divide Labour and play to Farage’s strengths is not a great strategy.Chasing Reform also puts at risk the large cohort of voters floating between Labour and the cluster of parties – Liberal Democrats, the SNP, the Greens – on its liberal left flank. Starmer’s relentless focus on socially conservative, Brexit-friendly“hero voters”eroded Labour’s appeal with this group, but the overriding urge to evict the Tories kept them on board last July.Now Labour’s hold on its progressive flank is slipping: while three in 10 Labour voters would consider a Reform vote, over four in 10 are thinking about the Lib Dems or Greens. A populist Labour campaign for Reform votes may be the last straw for many in this socially liberal, viscerally anti-Farage group, putting at risk hundreds of marginal seats where Reform is out of the running, but where Labour needs a united progressive front to prevail next time.Labour’s electoral Jenga tower is already wobbling. A firm push to the right could instead bring it crashing down on the left.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageThe ObserverReform UKLabourConservativesBrexitanalysisShareReuse this content"

But voters doubt he’ll be able to do what he says [on immigration] and so the only way to really show they want change is to vote for us.”Merz’s centre-right CDU/CSU alliance is hotly tipped to come first in the 23 February election with about 30% support, while the anti-migrant, anti-Islam AfD has held second place for months in the polls at just over 20%.Merz’s dramatic ploy to court far-right support in parliament for his “uncompromising” migration policies has failed to lure back AfD voters, opinion surveys suggest, with only negligible movement in support.Meanwhile, his characteristically impulsive stunt has shifted debate away from what polls say is Merz’s strongest selling point: theparlous state of the German economy. At the same time, his mercurial tactics appear to be stoking doubts about how he would govern.View image in fullscreenYoung supporters of CDU leader Friedrich Merz gather in the town of Sankt Ingbert in Saarland, southern Germany.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAGerman voters across the spectrum said last week that the turbulent campaign has left them deeply sceptical over whether the political centre is capable of forming alliances to address their concerns, with the AfD ready to pounce if things fall apart.Weekly news magazineDer Spiegelheadlined its latest cover story: “After the taboo breach: isGermanystill governable?” A YouGov poll showed four out of five Germans worry about what Merz’s muddier stance on the AfD will mean for future coalition talks among the mainstream parties.Lunchtime approached in Schkeuditz, a town near Leipzig airport, where many work at the giant DHL air cargo hub. Local people picking up a bratwurst at the grill van on the neat market square stopped to chat with Bochmann and his campaign volunteers, who handed out anti-theft credit card sleeves emblazoned with the blue AfD logo featuring an eye-catching red swoosh. It was the only party present.Bernd Ullrich, 72, said he had long voted for the CDU (Christian Democrats), Merz’s party, after the Berlin Wall fell but turned to the AfD for its anti-immigrant stance.“After reunification, we were proud of what we had achieved but now things are heading south and it’s all a result of [Angela] Merkel’s migration,” he said, referring to the former CDU chancellor’s decision a decade ago to leave the border open tomore than 1 million people fleeing war and poverty. Merz has also blamed that policy for fuelling the AfD’s rise.Assuming he wins, Merz would almost inevitably require a party to the CDU’s left – the Social Democrats or the Greens – to form a viable majority, Ullrich noted. Because Merz has ruled out a formal coalition with the AfD, that would require compromise on his pledges to curb migration by, for example, turning “irregular immigrants” back at the border.“Merz talks a good game [on immigration] but when the election is over, he’ll govern with red or green and have to backtrack,” Ullrich said, referring to the centre-left parties’ colours. “That’s election fraud.”Grit E, a 50-year-old Green voter, said she had been shocked to hear many longtime friends and neighbours in recent years give up on democratic parties, and worried that her teenage daughter’s outspoken opposition to the far right could get her into trouble in town. She fears Merz would not keep his word to bar the AfD from government.“It’s all been so chaotic and confusing,” she said of Merz’s AfD overtures. “He’s slammed his foot on the gas but is racing in the wrong direction. The way things are going is scary.”German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s unpopular “traffic light” coalitioncollapsed in November, triggering early elections seven months ahead of schedule. Merz, who has never run a ministry or one of Germany’s 16 regional states, has long looked well placed to realise adecades-old dream of becoming chancellor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the decision by Merz to chisel away at the“firewall” between centrists and the far righthas left many Germans angry, disoriented and fearful as they prepare to cast their ballots in two weeks’ time.View image in fullscreenThousands marched in Berlin last weekend in protest at CDU leader and German chancellorship candidate Friedrich Merz’s plans to limit migration.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersReligious leaders, human rights groups andMerkel herselfhave condemned Merz’s strategy as “wrong”, whiletens of thousands have joined protestsagainst the conservative candidate’s flirtation with the AfD.In the small town of Teltow in Brandenburg state, about 200 protesters rallied outside an AfD gathering one evening last week after hanging a “refugees welcome” banner above the main square.Several voters recalled that the turbulent political conditions of the Weimar era a century ago had allowed the Nazis to steamroll moderate forces. Casandra Hölscher, 32, an elementary school teacher, called the last week “emotional” for many Germans and said she worried that Merz was playing with fire and had no clear plan of how to protect democracy.“He has made it incredibly difficult for the SPD [Social Democratic party] or the Greens to say they will work with him – that’s what scares me,” she said. “Merz has manoeuvred his CDU into a difficult situation, and with it, us as a society.”Compared with many of its neighbours, Germany’s far right has taken much longer to reach critical mass. Numerous analysts put that down in part to the country’sculture of Holocaust remembrance,which has kept the Nazi horrors alive in the public consciousness.Kerstin, 50, who declined to give her surname because she has a doctor’s surgery in town, said it sickened her to see asylum seekers used as political scapegoats and she worried that a broadly shared understanding of the limits of political discourse was crumbling. “The refugees aren’t the problem but rather our approach to them. Many of them have experienced war and don’t get the care they need in Germany – not medically and, above all, not psychologically, which we’ve seen in these attacks,” she said.“You saw the same thing after the second world war, where soldiers who returned made the same kind of trouble. I spend a lot of time studying the Nazi period and the moment things reached the point of no return. I’m afraid now that things could get very radical.”Christoph Noack, 58, a religious studies teacher, said he took Merz at his word when he ruled out formally cooperating with the AfD and encouraged the candidate to draw lessons from a “mistake that backfired”.“Now it’s my hope that the established parties can band together and form a front against racism and incitement,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGermanyThe ObserverRefugeesAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)EuropeThe far rightAngela MerkelEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

What went wrong?When the pharma firm cancelled plans for a major expansion of its Merseyside plant last month, there was no shortage of questions – or blame – over responsibilityJulia KolleweSat 8 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 12.29 ESTShareAt a tense meeting with senior civil servants on the afternoon of 29 January, the UK chair ofAstraZeneca, Shaun Grady, pulled the plug on a planned £450m expansion of its childhood flu vaccine factory in Merseyside – bringing a year and a half of negotiations to an abrupt halt.The decision,announced publicly two days later, came just hours after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had singled out Britain’s biggest drugmaker as one of the country’s “great companies” in herlong-awaited speech on kickstarting UK growth.If successful, the scheme would have transformed the site into a six-hectareresearch and manufacturing centreproducing the next generation of vaccines – strengthening the UK’s pandemic readiness with the ability to make several at a time from start to finish.In July last year, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, had declared the project in the Liverpool suburb of Speke “absolutely ready to go”. So how didmonths of wranglingover a £90m state support offer made by the previous government collapse into recriminations?It is not the UK’s first big investment loss in this sector. At the height of Covid, Britain’s second biggest pharma firm, GSK – a major vaccine maker whose biggest site is in Belgium – was keen to start producing jabs in the UK. “They were looking at where they were going to build their future manufacturing,” said Clive Dix, whochaired the UK’s Covid vaccine taskforce during the pandemic. “I helped broker, getting them talking to government, and there were some great ideas going forward, but [GSK] walked away in the end. They just said: ‘Too slow. It’s too difficult.’”He said government departments “want you to fill so many forms in and go through so many hoops – it’s just not how business works, unfortunately”.Some have questioned the way civil servants calculate value for the taxpayer from big corporate investments that are supported by government incentives. In AstraZeneca’s case, Dix put the blame squarely on the “machinery at Whitehall”, pointing to “penny-pinching” civil servants who “don’t understand the ecosystem”. He argues that “ministers can only go by the recommendation they’re given”.View image in fullscreenLiverpool has a significant life sciences sector.Photograph: Rolf Richardson/AlamyKeith Neal, emeritus professor of epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: “Vaccines are a massive growth industry. I know the drug companies play one country [against] another, but … this was a potential major benefit to ensuring the vaccine supply”.AstraZeneca – the UK’s largest listed company, with a valuation of about £180bn – first began talking to ministers about the Speke expansion in July 2023 and it was announced in last year’s March budget by the then chancellor, Jeremy Hunt. The next day, he was pictured striding at the Speke factory wherehe describedthe investment as a “vote of confidence in the UK and an investment that helps to grow our economy”.The government’spress release notedthe decision was “contingent upon mutual agreement … and successful completion of regulatory processes”.But after Labour won the election on 4 July, all spending was put on hold by Reeves. Then, given theprecarious state of the public finances, the government decided to cut the Speke support package to £40m – less than half Hunt’s offer of £70m in grants and £20m in research and development (R&D) support.As meetings between the company, the Treasury, the business department, the science department and the Office for Life Sciences – part of the health and science departments – continued over months, the timetable, from AstraZeneca’s point of view, slipped.Why are billions of pounds pumped into the south on projects but they’re squabbling over small amounts for Liverpool?Carl Cashman, local authority opposition leaderIt had wanted to wrap up the deal by August to keep it on track with regard to other investments.The company is putting in $3.5bn(£2.8bn) in the US, and building a $1.5bn site to make next-generation cancer treatments in Singapore – where it has received “very substantial support”, Soriotsaid pointedly last week.The cell-based technology to be introduced at Speke – which can make vaccines more effective and easier to produce than the current egg-based process – required clinical trials ahead of regulatory approval.Shortly afterLabourwas elected, Grady told the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, that beginning in August was “an urgent issue … to meet our business case timelines”, according to a letter obtained by theTimes.The government upped its offer at the end of October, after Reeves announced a new £520m life sciences innovative manufacturing fund, and theFinancial Timesreported it was eventually revised to £78m. But AstraZeneca wanted the government to honour Hunt’s £90m proposal and Soriot said on Thursday the firm had been willing to increase its investment to £500m to seal the deal.Speaking after AstraZeneca reported a 38% jump in annual profits to $8.7bn, he denied any rift with the government: “We could not make the business case work and we needed a certain level of support to make this economically viable. And that was not possible for the government to justify, which we totally understand. We were all very disappointed.”AstraZeneca’s breast cancer drug Enhertuwas rejectedby the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) for use in England and Wales for the third time in November on pricing grounds. The rejection came despite months of negotiations and the intervention of the health secretary, Wes Streeting.Soriot denied any link between the decisions on Enhertu and Speke. He said the UK’s recent move to increase in the amount it clawed back from sales of NHS drugs had discouraged investment, but said that had “nothing to do with Speke”.View image in fullscreenEmma Walmsley of GSK: ‘It is absolutely critical that the UK government does step up and accelerate progress.’Photograph: REX/ShutterstockA government spokesperson said: “All government funding must demonstrate value for the taxpayer and, due to a change in the terms originally agreed, we could not justify offering the same amount of funding.”Chris Bryant, the science minister,told MPs last week that the support package had been cutbecause the drugmaker had reduced its proposed R&D spending at Speke from £150m to £90m, describing the cancelled investment as “deeply disappointing”. This left shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith to crow: “There’s no vaccine for incompetence.”Dix said: “This was a slam dunk. They shouldn’t be quibbling over £10m or £20m; we’re talking about trying to build resilience for the UK … It’s what the UK needs. It needs manufacturing capability. Manufacturing capability for science has moved abroad.”InLiverpool, the news was greeted with dismay and disbelief. The city’s regional combined authority was not part of the talks, but its mayor, Steve Rotheram, said he “continues to be in discussions with the government about the funding that had been earmarked for this project, and we are pushing to ensure that it remains in the city region, helping to fuel other transformational life ­sciences projects”.Carl Cashman, the authority’s opposition leader, urged the mayor to “demand answers” from parliament. He said: “It’s devastating news for the growth of the sector and for jobs but I think a wider point is: why [are] billions of pounds pumped into the south on projects but they’re squabbling over small amounts for Liverpool and the north in comparison?”The ditched investment may have ramifications for the city’s life science investment zone, where several disease projects are getting under way, said Janet Hemingway, former president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, who set up an infection innovation consortium in the city in 2020. AstraZeneca’s current Speke site only does routine flu vaccine manufacturing. “By expanding the site to do more vaccine-related R&D, it would have made it easier to collaborate,” she said.GSK’s chief executive, Emma Walmsley, also weighed into the debate, saying: “It is absolutely critical … that the UK government does step up and accelerate progress alongside industry, given the pace of change across the world and the fierce competition from other countries, which is only getting stronger.”The 450 people working at the Speke site found out about the cancellation when the news leaked, forcing AstraZeneca to rush out its announcement. While the 31 January statement stressed the facility would continue to produce childhood flu nasal spray for the UK and US vaccination programmes, this was cold comfort to those who had banked on a boost to the city – and to Reeves in her push for investment in Britain.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryThe ObserverAstraZenecaVaccines and immunisationHealthLiverpoolLabourRachel ReevesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, for the past two decades Ma, one of the four co-founders ofGoogle Maps, has buried himself in a big black hole of anonymity. But not because of any shame or regret – it’s just that he isn’t one to blow his own trumpet.“I tend to be a very private person,” Ma says in a rare interview. “I find the limelight uncomfortable.”In the years since launching on 8 February 2005,GoogleMaps has wormed its way into our daily lives, becoming – like water or electricity – an essential service. It’s a pocket atlas, compass, restaurant guide, bus timetable and the go-to search and recommendation engine for all our geospatial queries.Google owner drops promise not to use AI for weaponsRead moreGoogle Maps has become an online juggernaut boasting more than 2 billion monthly users worldwide that remains on a trajectory of relentless expansion in scope and scale. It also powers countless third-party platforms including Airbnb, Uber, real estate portals and food delivery and e-commerce platforms that rely on Google Maps’ locational and navigational prowess.The technology is now a key pillar of the Google/Alphabet technology complex, a company the author and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari describes as one of our “unfathomable, algorithmic overlords”.Now, on the eve of Google Maps’ 20th anniversary, the 54-year-old Australian software engineer has had a change of heart. He wants to write himself back into the foundation story – as well as acknowledge others whose contributions have been overlooked or undersold.View image in fullscreen‘I’m actually surprised how similar [the prototype] looks to what Google Maps looks like today,’ Ma says.Photograph: Isabella Moore/The GuardianBeing recognised as a Google Maps founder still garners a lot of respect from the Stem community – particularly in Australia, where Google Maps was born. It might not make you a household name but it can open doors.Ma’s story begins in the New South Wales country town of Cooma, where his family ran a Chinese restaurant. For 20 years until the mid-1980s, the Dragon’s Gate was a fixture on Cooma’s main street, serving Cantonese-Australian favourites including chicken chow mein and sweet and sour pork.It provided a livelihood for the extended family and everyone pitched in. When he wasn’t attending school, Ma worked the till, taking payments, bookings and takeaway orders. In all other respects, however, he remembers it as a normal childhood – much of which was spent in front of screens.“I did a lot of the stereotypical tech nerd things like playing video games and learning how to program on an Apple II computer,” he recalls.By 1998, Ma had graduated from university and was working in Sydney when he landed a job in Silicon Valley, just as the dotcom boom was careering towards peak insanity. Then the bubble burst and, by the early 2000s, Ma, along with thousands of others in the tech sector, found themselves unemployed.After returning to Sydney he was contacted by a former colleague and fellow Australian called Noel Gordon who invited Ma to join him and two other unemployed software engineers – the Danish brothers Jens and Lars Rasmussen – to work on a startup. Their big idea was to build a new type of mapping platform.At that time, the undisputed market leader in online mapping was MapQuest, which had been acquired by the internet giant AOL in 1999 for the then staggering sum of $US1.1bn.But MapQuest was clunky and lived halfway between the digital and analogue worlds: a user plotting a route had to print the turn-by-turn directions from their desktop or laptop computer. It was a digital dinosaur, completely unaware of the approaching cataclysm.Calling themselves Where 2 Technologies, the four partners based themselves in the spare bedroom of Gordon’s apartment in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill and began building a Windows application program they dubbed Expedition.A screenshot of the 2004 prototype Ma shows me has a familiar look and feel. There’s an address bar at the top and in the centre, a map of downtown San Francisco with a route following Interstate 80 over the Bay Bridge highlighted as a red line. Two location pins, in the form of a US-style letterbox on a pole, mark specific locations.“I’m actually surprised how similar it looks to what Google Maps looks like today,” says Ma, inspecting the screenshot for the first time in many years.View image in fullscreenThe Where 2 team was acquired in 2004 by Google; months later, Google Maps made its debut.Photograph: Algi Febri Sugita/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockThis was the demo they presented to Sequoia Capital, the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm that has been bankrolling some of the biggest names in the startup world since the 1970s. The Where 2 crew was hoping to secure some seed funding and take the pressure off their dwindling personal savings and maxed-out credit cards.But in March 2004 Yahoo Maps launched a new feature called SmartView, enabling users to conduct map-based searches for restaurants and entertainment venues. Today it’s a standard feature on all online maps; back then, it was groundbreaking enough to spook Sequoia into pulling the plug on the deal.As a consolation prize, the Where 2 team was introduced to Google, one of Sequoia’s star clients. And not just anyone at Google: they got to present their demo to Larry Page, one of Google’s co-founders.Google parent Alphabet’s revenues disappoint Wall Street amid stiff AI competitionRead morePage was impressed but had no interest in desktop software. “Wereallylike the web,” he told the Rasmussen brothers – meaning Google was only interested if the map features worked in the web browser.The Where 2 team scrambled together a web version of their program using a little-known set of web development techniques known by the acronym Ajax, short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, a web language. It meant an already loaded webpage could fetch new data – in other words, update itself – without needing to refresh the entire page.Instead of loading a massive image of a map, the webpage would load multiple smaller map tiles and display them as required. It gave the sense of dynamic, frictionless motion you now experience on all online mapping platforms.The demo was a hit. Google hired the Where 2 team and subsequently bought their intellectual property for an undisclosed price.“Google was very good at picking up good teams at very low prices because there was no competition in the acquisition space at that time,” says Ma.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would be have been split between multiple owners.Since then, shares in Google’s holding company Alphabet have surged. Adjusting for stock splits, a share was worth about US$2 when the company floated in 2004. This week, shares are trading in the US$190 to US$200 range.On 7 June 2004 the Where 2 crew turned up for work as Google employees at the company’s Sydney office, which at that time only comprised six salespeople. Eight months later, Google Maps made its debut.“It’s a great product and they did what they did very successfully,” says Prof Scott McQuire, a professor of media and communications at the University of Melbourne. “[But] Google Maps works on the basis of data extraction. It’s getting location information, so that’s very valuable data for all kinds of people who want to gather information about you.”Ma says commercialisation and data mining were not on the radar when he was working on the maps. These emerged after he moved on to other projects in 2006. “I don’t think we were thinking about it too much about it at the time,” he says.“The prevailing belief was that once you get the users on board, you could then figure out a strategy.”He acknowledges the privacy concerns: the task of keeping companies honest and transparent is partly in the hands of the user and partly the responsibility of governments, he says. “The biggest issue is the fact that the technology landscape changes so quickly. It’s very hard for these regulatory mechanisms to keep up.”It’s not just privacy that is raising red flags. There’s also an emerging anxiety about the effect over-reliance on satellite navigation – and by inference, Google Maps – is having on brain function.View image in fullscreen‘Knowing that so many people are using something that I helped build, that’s probably the most satisfying part of it.’Photograph: Isabella Moore/The GuardianScientific studies show that extended reliance on these drivers’ aides may be associated with a reduction in the hippocampus, the part of the brain dealing with spatial memory. This could be a factor in cognitive decline.Ma acknowledges that there are potential dangers in the uptake of many new technologies but believes we should be aware more than concerned. “I think as humans, we are very adaptable. But are we adapting it in a way that is overcoming the potential detriment? I don’t know.”Ma is not the type of garrulous, big-vision character usually associated with the startup scene. He’s a bit unkempt, a bit traditional and not one for chit-chat. But he is proud of the role he played in getting Google Maps off the ground.“There are ways to feel rewarded,” he says. “It could be monetary, it could be recognition. But knowing that so many people are using something that I helped build, that’s probably the most satisfying part of it.”In terms of who gets the credit, Ma says while there were originally four people behind Where 2, most of the kudos should go to Jens and Lars Rasmussen: it was their idea in the first place.But there are others whose contributions have been overlooked. In particular, he cites Bret Taylor, James Norris, Andrew Kirmse and Seth LaForge, whose names were included on the original Google Maps patent. If there are any arguments about Google Maps’ origin story, Ma says this list should settle the dispute.“I think it’s important because quite often the perception is that one or two people are responsible for the majority of the work, whereas almost always it’s going to be a team.”Noel Gordon, Ma’s Google Maps co-founder, describes Ma as a “rockstar software engineer” who can write beautiful code with “no fat on it”.“Stephen is one of those people who gets straight to the point that needs to be solved, really quickly. He’s just one of a kind.”These days, Ma is working with a partner in a venture called Reggie Health. It uses AI to automate administrative tasks for healthcare providers and anyone else who needs to juggle appointments, manage patients and send reminders.Since leaving Google 14 years ago, Ma has only ever worked in startups: up to this point, none has been successful. But that doesn’t deter him. He’s someone who gets a thrill from tackling problems and finding solutions.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorGoogle MapsGoogleAlphabetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was 23 and had just finished my literature degree in England. I had returned home to Melbourne for three months to apply for the work visa I needed to start my first grown-up job in London.I’d been a student journalist so thought I’d keep myself busy with some writing. I was asked by a local lifestyle publication to write an article on the best dumplings in Melbourne. The only problem was I hadn’t lived in Melbourne for five years – and had never eaten dumplings.Panicked, I asked my friends to recommend their favourite local dumpling spots. My best friend, Milly, passed my email on to her boyfriend’s friend, Hugh. He wrote back: “I love a place called Hutong – why don’t we all go?”The moment I knew: she grasped my hand – and we went from political comrades to loversRead moreThe next week Milly and I caught the train into the city. I was glad I’d worn my new pink skirt when I saw the guy who’d be joining us for dinner – he had dark hair, brown eyes and looked sharp in a crisp blue business shirt.Over a few bottles of red wine I discovered I liked both dumplings and the person sitting opposite me. Here was someone with a razor-sharp brain who noticed the absurdities of every situation, making us laugh with stories about his zany housemates. Afterwards we kicked on to a bar; then, because the night wasn’t young but we were, we all went back to my parents’ house and drank more red.A few hours later Milly went home and I asked Hugh if he wanted to crash in the guest room. It still housed the wooden rocking horse me and my siblings had played on as children. As I said goodnight to Hugh, I climbed atop the horse with its faded paint and thinned-out mane. He laughed and our eyes met. Then Hugh crossed the room, leaned down and kissed me.One hot February night I told him my visa had been processed and I cried in his armsI never wrote the article about Melbourne’s best dumplings because over the next few weeks my only preoccupation was Hugh. We spent every day together, living in the moment of our “summer fling”. He noticed my bookshelves were crammed with romantic comedies and left a new novel by my favourite author, Catherine Alliott, on my bedside table with a note inside the cover and handwritten comments throughout that made me laugh. Hugh took my eccentric family in his stride and won over my mum by taking the family dog on his runs. On Valentine’s Day he created a scavenger hunt of treats across the city. And we realised we were a good team – Hugh treated every task as if he were painting the Sistine Chapel whereas I could start and not finish most things.As summer drew to a close, our days together took on an urgency and intensity. I was returning to England while Hugh’s job required him to stay in Melbourne. We began to dance around the idea that what was happening between us was more than a summer fling but we avoided discussing the true depth of our feelings.One hot February night I told him my visa had been processed and I cried in his arms.Normally when boarding a plane at Tullamarine airport bound for Heathrow, I would be grinning. On this trip I spent the whole flight in tears.On my first day back in London I found myself walking alone through the rain to Daunt bookstore where I bought a copy of Penguin’s Poems for Love. I needed other people’s words to express what at that moment I could not. When I got home to my basement flat a parcel was waiting for me. Inside the box, beneath the bubble wrap, lay a miniature wooden rocking horse. Grinning, I took a selfie with the present and sent it to Hugh: “I love you too.”View image in fullscreenSteph and Hugh on their wedding day in 2019We lasted nine months living in different hemispheres, meeting up for one magical European summer holiday but otherwise subsisting on Skype calls. By the following Australian summer we were together again.Now, 12 years later, Hugh and I are married. We live in Melbourne, a short train ride from Hutong, with our two kids who love dumplings. And in the corner of my daughter’s bedroom is a rocking horse.Steph Vizard is the author ofThe Love Contract(HarperCollins, A$24.99)Share your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Now, set to become the first incumbent president to attend a Super Bowl, it appears that the US’s most popular sport is genuflecting before him.Trump will reportedly attend the clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday in New Orleans as a guest of Gayle Benson, the owner of the New Orleans Saints. A pre-recorded interview conducted by a Fox News anchor will also air during the pre-game show of an event that last year was viewed bymore than 123m Americans. And while he watches the action, Trump will not have to stare at a message inspired by the kind of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) strategies that he is intent on bulldozing.The real-estate tycoon is back in the White House for the first time in four years and for the first time in aSuper Bowlsince 2021 the message “End Racism” will not be stencilled on to the field in one of the end zones. End Racism is a slogan the NFL began to promote after George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis in 2020. The phrase formed part of Inspire Change, a community social justice initiative the league launched in the wake of the former quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s activism against racism and police brutality.Super Bowl repeat or revenge? Whatever happens, history will be madeRead moreTrump, however, sought to use the protests to rile up his base during his first term, urging team owners to fire players who kneel during the anthem and encouraging fans to walk out. Thatdrew a ripostefrom the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, who said that “divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL”.Goodell told reporters on Monday that the league will continue its “diversity efforts” and an NFL spokesmantold The Athleticthat “Choose Love” and “It Takes All Of Us” will be written in the end zones as an appropriate response to the recent terrorist attack in New Orleans’ French Quarter, the Washington air collision and the Los Angeles wildfires.Still, the slogan change and the president’s planned presence in the Caesars Superdome are conspicuous at a time when American sports appear to be following the corporate sector in adopting policies ofappeasementor silence towards Trump, who has signed executive orders aimed ateliminating DEI initiativesin the federal government and pressurising private entities into stifling their programs. To his supporters this is a salvo in the“war on woke”.To his criticsthe tactic is a hallmark of a racist agenda.“President Trump loves a victory lap and this is certainly a victory lap over the NFL,” says Brandon Rottinghaus, a politics professor at the University of Houston and co-director of thePresidential Greatness Projectsurvey.The “Trump dance” became a viral celebration in the NFL after last November’s election, while on Wednesday the Chiefs’ biggest stars, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce,both said it will be “cool”to play in front of Trump. Kelce added that it will be “awesome” and “a great honor … no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited”. His enthusiasm raised eyebrows since he is in a relationship with Taylor Swift. The pop star endorsed Kamala Harris in the election and Trump responded by declaring “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” on social media.The basketball star LeBron James, who called Trumpa “bum”in 2017 and supported Harris last year, is among the previously outspoken high-profile athletes who have kept quiet so far in Trump’s second term. Of course, the administration is less than a month old. But Trump has been busy, issuing a flurry of directives on culture wars issues and inviting Elon Musk to eradicate large portions of the federal government. And Trump is explicitly using sports as a political tool, perhaps even more flagrantly than in his first term.At half time of the College Football Playoff National Championship on 20 January – Trump’s inauguration day – ESPN, the leading American sports network, aired avideo messagefrom Trump that amounted to a political broadcast in which he said Americans had “suffered greatly” under the Biden administration. ESPN said the gameaveraged 22m viewers, making it the most-watched non-NFL sporting event of the past year.View image in fullscreenTrump attended the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship game at the Superdome, where Sunday’s Super Bowl will be played.Photograph: Jamie Schwaberow/Getty ImagesAfter campaigning on a pledge to “keep men out of women’s sports”, on Wednesday, surrounded by young female athletes, Trump signed an executive orderbanning transgender athletesfrom taking part in women’s sports, the latest in a series of gender-related directives. The NCAA, US college sports’ governing body,fell in linethe next day with what its president, Charlie Baker, described as Trump’s “clear, national standard”.Though a sitting president’s Super Bowl attendance will be a novelty, American commanders-in-chief have a long tradition of attending baseball games: William Taft threw theceremonial first pitchon opening day in Washington in 1910. George W Bush, a former part-owner of the Texas Rangers, famouslytook to the moundbefore a 2001 World Series game at Yankee Stadium in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Trump, though, is probably more interested in other sports, and not merely because he wasbooedand subjected to a chant of “lock him up” in 2019 while attending a Washington Nationals World Series game only three miles away from the White House.Americans expected to place record $1.39bn in bets for Super Bowl LIXRead moreThe US will host the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games and Trump, who has achummy relationshipwith Fifa president Gianni Infantino, has a replica of the soccer trophy onprominent displayin the Oval Office. “I anticipate seeing the president very involved in the pop culture and sports worlds, it’s an easy way for him to connect to people,” Rottinghaus says.Barack Obama attended games and filled out an annual college basketball prediction bracket, but his relationship with sports seemed driven by passionate fandom more than political calculation. Trump sees sports as a vehicle with a value that goes far beyond photo opportunities with celebrities.“The infusion of sports culture and politics is a way that Donald Trump can demonstrate wins,” Rottinghaus adds. “It’s one thing to eliminate DEI at agencies in government that most people have never heard of, it’s another to get theNFLand individual teams to change the way that they message their product. That’s a different kind of win that’s really the kind of thing that his supporters want.”Trump’s fractious relationship with the NFL predates the anthem controversy. Long a frustrated wannabe team owner, he made a failed attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2014 in what turned into a fierce rivalry with a bidspearheaded by Jon Bon Jovi. And as the owner of the New Jersey Generals, a team in the defunct United States Football League, he led anill-fated anti-trust lawsuitagainst the NFL in 1986 with the aim of forcing a merger. But he wasfeted by fanson a visit to a Pittsburgh Steelers game last October, while in his previous term as president he named the co-owner of the New York Jets, Woody Johnson, as ambassador to the UK.The Republicanwrote on Fridaythat it “WILL BE A GREAT GAME!!!” However, the state of relative calm between Trump and the NFL might be contingent on the musical entertainment and whether the Chiefs win their third successive title. The half-time show is not usually overtly political but this year it is headlined by the rapper Kendrick Lamar, whose 2015 track Alright wasadoptedby Black Lives Matter demonstrators. In 2017 herapped: “Donald Trump is a chump”.Trump, meanwhile, hailed the Chiefs on social media after their AFC Championship Game victory over the Bills a fortnight ago: “Congratulations to theKansas City Chiefs. What a GREAT Team, Coach, Quarterback, and virtually everything else, including those fantastic FANS, that voted for me (MAGA!) in record numbers.”He also praised the Bills. But there was no mention of the Eagles thrashing the Washington Commanders earlier in the day. Philadelphia won the Super Bowl in 2018. That year Trump scrapped their invitation to the White House - an honor habitually afforded to the victorious team - after it became clear thatalmost none of the players or staffwere willing to attend as a result of his divisive conduct. Last year Trump depicted the heavily-Democratic city as acrime-ravaged dystopia. Another Philadelphia victory might re-ignite hostilities and explode what appears to be an uneasy truce – or else offer more evidence that the sporting climate has shifted from resistance to acceptance.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlDonald TrumpPhiladelphia EaglesKansas City ChiefsSuper Bowl LIXUS sportsNFLfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now it is to be knocked down as part of a huge developmentRowan Moore’s viewMorgan OforiSat 8 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 11.25 ESTShareWhen judges awarded Salford’s Centenary Building the inauguralStirling prizein 1996, they declared it “a dynamic, modern and sophisticated exercise in steel, glass and concrete”.The recognition as Britain’s best new building from the Royal Institute of British Architects cementedSalfordas an emblem of emerging northern architecture.But last month Salford city councilapproved the demolitionof the Centenary Building – which has not been in use since at least 2021– despite vocal opposition from preservation campaigners and the architecture industry.The Crescent partnership, which includes Salford city council, English Cities Fund (ECF) and Salford University, which owns the building, said in a joint statement that while “careful consideration has been given to the history of the building with multiple options explored”, it will be demolished next month as part of the comprehensive development of Adelphi village, an area surrounding the university. The project is part of a £2.5bn plan that aims to deliver housing. “While the Centenary Building has been part of the university estate for a number of decades, it is now unecological to run, with major structural, heating and ventilation flaws throughout,” the partnership said.Critics, however, say the decision is “wasteful and irresponsible” and are urging the partnership to change their minds. The Twentieth Century Society criticised the decision not to list the building and said it wasn’t too late for the university to reconsider its plans. “The decision has allowed the local authority to wave through demolition without adequate scrutiny,” said its director, Catherine Croft. Opened in 1995 by the Duke of Edinburgh, in the area east of the River Irwell, and originally designed for the University of Salford’s school of electrical engineering department, the building was used by the faculty of art and design technology upon completion.Centenary Building locatorStephen Hodder, the architect responsible for the Centenary Building, said he was disappointed, and felt that history was being erased, as it had been built to mark 100 years since the formation of the university. “The question has always got to be, has that building outlived its usefulness? Georgian buildings were candle lit, and then electricity was introduced,” Hodder said. “So a building has got to be capable of being upgraded in its life.“It was part of the brief that the building needed to be flexible. There’s a servicing strategy within that building to allow it to be changed and upgraded.“My reading of the situation is somebody’s taking the commercial decision over the cost of it being upgraded.”The Twentieth Century Society tried to have the building listed by Historic England, but the public body concluded in its initial assessment report that, when considered against the high standard required for buildings of its age, the Centenary Building lacked the special interest in a national context required to merit listing. Previous attempts to adapt the building for a different use have also failed – proposed plans to convert it into a primary school were shelved in 2018. Until 2021, the Channel 4 reality seriesThe Circlehad editing suites in the building while filming in a residential block opposite.The Twentieth Century Society has described the demolition as “wasteful and irresponsible”, and critics point to the carbon footprint of the construction industry. In 2022 England generated 63m tonnes of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste. Making bricks and steel creates vast amounts of CO2, with cement alone causing 8% of global emissions.AHistoric England studyin 2019 stated that embodied emissions from refurbished or retrofitted buildings accounted for a minimum of 2% of a building’s total emissions over 60 years. That figure rises to 28% in demolished and new buildings. Salford city council has a target of 2038 for net zero carbon emissions. Last month, Scott Anderson, a mature construction student at Salford University walking by the Centenary Building, said there were other buildings on campus that were not fit for purpose. “The construction industry is a beast that needs to be fed,” he said. “If you drive around central Manchester long enough you’ll see a new [building] going up every two minutes. If anyone had any sense in councils, they would just strip some of the old works out, put something new in. But there’s more money to be made when you tear the whole thing down and build another big thing. Everybody makes money off that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has now been vacant for a third of its built life.“The [redevelopment] project is part of the £2.5bn Crescent Salford masterplan which will deliver housing, to cater to a broad range of residents.

At first glance, childhood cancer survivors may seem like an unusual population in which to study ageing, but as Greg Armstrong, principal investigator of St Jude’s Childhood Cancer Survivorship Study, explains, we now know they represent a group of individuals who are ageing unusually quickly.For while modern chemotherapies and radiotherapies have becomeincreasingly efficientat curing childhood cancers, this comes at a great cost, owing to the corrosive impact of such treatment on these children’s bodies, something that becomes more apparent when they reach middle age.“Of these children, 85% are going to beat their cancer, but it’s a win at a cost,” says Armstrong. “We know that these kids will have shortened lifespans. They often die young of chronic diseases like heart disease, stroke or secondary cancers which present much earlier. And we discovered about a decade ago that this is because they’re ageing much faster than their chronological age.”In particular, this is reflected not just in their biology, but in physical frailty. When Kirsten Ness, a physical therapist and clinical epidemiologist at St Jude,assessed a group of childhood cancer survivorsaged 24-41, she noted that when it came to heart function, flexibility, respiratory capacity and range of motion, they resembled people decades older. “We showed that at 30, they have physiological frailty that resembles people in their 70s and 80s, and it’s getting worse over time,” says Ness.The underlying cause of this is senescence, a state in which cells cease to continue dividing as normal, but instead simply linger, refusing to die. Because of this quality, senescent cells have sometimes been described as “zombie cells” and they are now regarded as a driving force and a reflection of ageing. Over the course of a lifetime, our bodies incur increasing amounts of damage which in turn makes many of our cells, distributed throughout our body, more likely to become senescent.For childhood cancer survivors,it appearsthat the consequence of undergoing such radical treatments at a young age leaves them with abnormally large populations of senescent cells, which would normally take decades to accrue. Ness explains that this drives loss of function and disease risk, and not only because senescent cells cease to function as they normally would. Senescent cells also generate a stream of inflammatory molecules, something known as thesenescence-associated secretory phenotype(SASP). “If we look at data from our childhood cancer survivors, we can see that they have this low-grade inflammation,” says Ness. “And so they don’t feel great, they don’t move great.”Over the past decade, interest has steadily grown in a class of drugs known as senolytics, so called because they have been shown to be capable of eliminating senescent cells in mice by disabling certain pathways, causing them to self-destruct. One of the most well-studied senolytics is actually a chemotherapy drug called dasatinib, while others include the natural chemicals quercetin and fisetin, which are found in various fruits and vegetables.Now, Armstrong is leadinga trialof 50-60 childhood cancer survivors with signs of frailty, along with blood-based markers that indicate a significant amount of senescence. Aged about 40, on average, the participants will receive oral doses of either dasatinib and quercetin, or fisetin, to see whether it can improve their physical function over the course of six months. These individuals will then be tracked every five years to assess whether this treatment can help extend their life expectancy.For researchers into ageing around the world, such data represents a first tentative step towards indicating whether senolytics could one day be used as a way of extending healthy lifespan in all older adults.At September’s British Society for Research onAgeingconference, Johannes Grillari, director of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Traumatology in Vienna, discussed the future of senolytics in front of an intrigued audience of gerontologists.As Grillari explained, while scientists continue to assess the long-term safety profile of these drugs, they will mostly be used in trials of patients with advanced illnesses, where the accumulation of senescent cells is thought to be a significant contributing factor.“It’s all about the risk-benefit ratio, and if you’re considering giving them to healthy individuals then the risk must be close to zero,” Grillari later told theObserver.“But the promise is that these cells seem to be a common denominator in every age-associated disease that has ever been looked at: cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, lung fibrosis, chronic kidney disease, you name it. And if we use senolytics, we see that the inflammation goes away and the regenerative capacity of the surrounding tissue is restored – well, at least if you’re a mouse.”Based on dozens of preclinical studies in which rodents have been manipulated to develop various chronic diseases before being cured, senolytics are now starting to reach humans. The data so far is limited but clinical trials are under way to see whether dasatinib and quercetin can modulate disease progressionin patientsin the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, while this same combination has previously been shown toalleviate some physical dysfunctionin people with chronic lung disease.View image in fullscreenGreg Armstrong of St Jude children’s research hospital in Memphis is leading a trial that hopes to extend the life expectancy of childhood cancer survivors.Grillari – who is also co-founder of Rockfish Bio, a company that has developed its own senolytic – is now hoping to launch trials in other disease states, as well as using the company’s senolytic to try to rejuvenate organs from older donors. While the NHS says there is no age limit for becoming an organ donor,research has previously shownthat recipients of organs donated by the over-60s tend to have poorer outcomes because the organ is more likely to have existing damage, while the rejection rate is also much higher.“There was a study in the 2000s that showed that the more senescent cells you have in a human transplant organ, the worse the outcome of the transplantation,” says Grillari. “Because the senescent cells are pro-inflammatory, they attack the recipients’ immune system, and seem to attack the donor organ more frequently. The hope is that senolytics can help, because kidney transplant organs, for example, are so rare.”All of this will provide more data on the safety and efficacy of various senolytics, while many studies are continuing to focus on their potential benefit in relatively young people with advanced disease. Dutch government agencies are fundinga trialwhere dasatinib and quercetin will be offered to patients aged 18-65 with a diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a diet-related chronic illness where senescent cells are believed to be driving fibrosis, or scarring, throughout the organ, impairing its ability to function. According to Stijn Meijnikman, a gastroenterology and hepatology doctor leading the trial, the hope is that removing these cells will enable the liver to repair itself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Clearing away everything could have negative long-term consequences“In mice, you see that if you get rid of the senescent cells, you get rid of the fibrosis,” says Meijnikman. “So we’re looking to see indications of that in humans. It’s a very short trial, but we’re hoping that briefly disrupting the pathways that allow senescent cells to persist will enable them to be cleaned up by the immune system.”The wider community of longevity scientists and investors remain intrigued as to whether these drugs can ultimately help reverse some of the signs of ageing in mid to later life, and perhaps even extend human lifespan.“More people are becoming familiar with the concept of senescent cells and how you can maybe positively influence this,” says Marc Bernegger, founder of Longevity Investors, a funding network.Glancing at a photo that Grillari pulls up on our Teams call, it’s easy to understand the excitement. It shows an elderly mouse of 34 months – equivalent to 90 in human years – its fur thinning and grey. “Just like us, they get bald patches as they age,” laughs Grillari.In another picture, after being treated with a senolytic, the same mouse appears visibly younger. Its fur has grown back and regained its original pigmentation. If such a drug were to achieve similar results in humans, it would undoubtedly be a blockbuster.But many are urging caution. Prof Tohru Minamino of Juntendo University in Japan, who has studied cellular senescence for two decades, points out that some senescent cells are beneficial to our body, playing important roles in key physiological functions such as wound healing. Simply clearing away everything could have negative long-term consequences.Minamino believes that he may have the answer. In 2021, he and his colleaguesunveiled an “ageing vaccine”that uses a protein called GPNMB to selectively remove senescent cells that contribute to inflammation. “We’re trying to specifically target the bad guys,” he says.Once again, this has been shown to work remarkably well in mice, with older rodents showing fewer functional impairments after receiving the vaccine and living substantially longer. Minamino is now hoping to develop this as an RNA-style vaccine, similar to the Covid jab, which trains the immune system to remove inflammatory senescent cells and could be used in patients with Alzheimer’s, chronic lung disease or frailty.“One of the challenges at the moment is that we don’t have particularly good tools to estimate the number of senescent cells in the human body and the extent to which this changes with treatment,” says Minamino. “But if we can develop better imaging systems for measuring how these cells are accumulating, you can envision a future where this could be part of an annual medical check.”Ultimately though, researchers caution that senescent cells are still only one piece of the ageing puzzle. As Meijnikman points out when I ask whether senolytics could be used to revive the livers of 80-year-olds, which have been weathered by decades of heavy drinking or a bad diet, this isn’t only about clearing senescence.“Your body still needs to have the capacity to regenerate,” he says. “There’s still an open question about what would happen if we get rid of the senescent cells, but there’s no reservoir of new cells to replace them any more because your stem cells are no longer working. We are going to move this way in the future, treating more and more older people, but for now we first need to gather more evidence that senolytics can really work in humans.”Explore more on these topicsAgeingThe ObserverBiotechnology industryHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But for centuries, the two scientists’ reliance on Indigenous expertise and names for their field notes has been overlooked.Polynesian andMāorisocieties and other Indigenous people living in thePacific islandsprovided knowledge that helped Banks and Solander to identify and describe approximately 1,400 species of plants that were unknown to European scientists, research by a Cambridge University academic has revealed.Dr Edwin Rose, of Darwin College, analysed previously overlooked evidence from Solander and Banks’s field notebooks, index cards and annotated texts for his bookReading the World: British Practices of Natural History, 1760-1820, which will bepublished next month.He found that Solander and Banks formulated many of the Latin names and descriptions of the new species they “discovered” using information they observed or gathered from Indigenous people.View image in fullscreen1930 poster of Captain James Cook and his crew.Illustration: Buyenlarge/Getty ImagesFor example, Solander noted that children “suck out the sweet juice” from the elongated bud of a white flowering vine, now known asOperculina turpethum.“He makes a specific reference to the elongated bud when describing the plant’s physical features,” said Rose. “I think he paid particular attention to that part of the plant because he saw Indigenous people using it in a particular way.”This may also be reflected in the original name Solander gave the plant:Convolvulus alatus. The Latin wordalatusmeans “furnished with wings”, and could refer to both the appearance of the plant and its effect on the children who sucked it.As well as the new Latin names Banks and Solander made up, which then became the plant’sofficial binomial– its two-part name made up of genus and species – they also often wrote down the existing Indigenous names for a species, spelling them out phonetically and so creating the first written records. “The field notes are quite dense, but they left a blank margin for the binomial, where I noticed all these interesting, phonetic-looking words, like Pao-hue tee eu-ihe,” said Rose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They record several Indigenous names for each plant, because the different communities they encountered gave the same plant different names.”He estimates the two botanists collected Indigenous names for nearly 700 species. “There’s a lot of communication going on between the naturalists and the Indigenous people, particularly after they are joined by anavigator called Tupaia, who was an essential link and translator between them and Polynesian societies.”The Indigenous names the botanists collected provided a “very important” reference point for their research, said Rose.“We’ve got this fairly shaky Latin binomial that they’re devising in the field – so shaky the binomials often change later on in history – and then they list the Indigenous names underneath … The Indigenous names are the main supporting evidence for these binomials.”For example, Solander named the kawakawa plantPiper myristicumafter learning that from the leaves Indigenous people made a strong-smelling ointment which was used medicinally and in religious ceremonies.Myristicumderives from the Greek termmuristikós, referring to a fragrant ointment or perfume used in cultural practices. But this connection was lost when the plant was later renamedPiper excelsumby other botanists.Listing Indigenous names underneath the binomial also ensured that future European botanists visiting the Pacific would know what name to give an Indigenous person to find that particular plant, and served as a kind of proof of Banks and Solander’s work.James Cook: The Voyages review – eye-opening records of colliding worldsRead moreRose’s research also sheds light on one of two paintings of a Polynesian man called Omai, who met Solander and Banks when he visited London in 1775, that hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. There has been much speculation about the scene depicted in Mai (Omai), Sir Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander by William Parry. Rose unearthed evidence in the scientists’ index cards that suggests Omai was asked to refine further details on species they had encountered in the Pacific.“On the manuscript slip forConvolvulus alatusand at least 30 others, Solander has actually recorded another Indigenous name for the plant and has written next to it ‘Omai’ – which is a citation to him.”Explore more on these topicsIndigenous peoplesThe ObserverPacific islandsPlantsShareReuse this content"

Work is apace to be open in a fortnight. The job ad has gone out. Fifty “girls” wanted and they are “hiring in all positions”.Hooters, the American “breastaurant”, known for its chicken wings and female waiting staff in skimpy nylon shorts and tight vests, is launching in the city centre ofNewcastleupon Tyne. The experiment in the north-east of England may well prove to be the decisive test of the brand’s reach in Britain.“For over 40 years, Hooters has built a reputation across the globe for making people happy, and we are excited to bring our one-of-a-kind guest experience to Newcastle in the iconic Bigg Market within the city centre, with an official opening expected this month,” the company said in a statement to the Guardian.“It’s horrible,” responded Jen Bagelman, 41, a professor of geography at Newcastle University who lives close by in the city centre. “We can do better than this.”The Newcastle franchise will be the third in the UK, after Nottingham and Liverpool, but the arrival of the “Hooters girls” on Tyneside can be fairly said to have a wider significance.It is an attempt to buck a trend, in Britain and abroad.The company, founded on April Fools’ Day 1983 (the founders never expected their joke to last), has hundreds of restaurants in the US but it has undergone a period of retrenchment in recent years.View image in fullscreenA billboard advertising Hooters in Nottingham, the only franchise that has been successful in the UKPhotograph: Mark Richardson/AlamyMany restaurants mothballed during the Covid crisis failed to reopen or struggled thereafter amid changes in eating habits and tastes.The introduction of shorter shorts for the waiting staff in 2021 proved insufficient to stir interest among the younger generations in America. Last September the company, which has been owned by private equity since 2019, announced the closure of 40 of its outlets.Meanwhile, the story in Britain has been an almost entirely troubled one since the restaurant franchise arrived in Birmingham in 1998 to great fanfare, only to promptly shut less than 18 months later.A host of excuses were given for that closure, including soaring rent rates, but the background noise was that of war veterans complaining that the restaurant was disrespectfully close to the Hall of Memory memorial, while campaigners accused the company of objectifying women.In the 2000s, there was another push to expand into the UK, with the goal of opening in 36 locations by 2012. It didn’t happen.Franchises that opened in Bristol and Cardiff in 2010 closed in 2012. The fate of the outlet in Bristol may have been sealed after claims that staff had given a cake to a 12-year-old boy and his friends in the shape of naked breasts.A licence was granted in 2022 to open in Salford despite the opposition of the city mayor, Paul Dennett, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and local MPs, but the project came to nothing after “complex” negotiations with a landlord.An earlier plan to open in Newcastle in 2015 was foiled after opposition from Northumbria police who claimed it would attract more stag and hen parties, which could lead to a rise in crime.View image in fullscreenThe Hooters restaurant on Bigg Market, Newcastle, which is due to open this month.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianLiverpool’s Hooters opened in 2022 despite the protestations of thethen mayor of Liverpool, Joanne Anderson, who claimed the chain had an “infamously sexually objectifying and misogynistic environment”.Its owners found themselves bogged down in legal disputes over the restaurant’s signage and the company behind it went into liquidation in December. A new franchisee has taken over.The only proven success in the UK has been the Nottingham franchise, run since 1998 by Julian Mills and his Canadian business partner, Johnny Goard, who owns five Hooters in his home country. They are behind the launch in Newcastle.A potentially difficult public consultation over a licence and planning application has been avoided after transferring existing permissions from previous leaseholders.But familiar opposition has been roused in recent days. It is understood that concerns have been raised by councillors internally after lobbying from local residents.Kruti Walsh, the policy director at the feminist charity FiLiA, said: “Violence against women and girls is an epidemic so we firmly oppose plans to expand a chain that treats women as objects to be served up alongside chicken wings and fries.” Walsh argued that an establishment focused on the sexual desirability of its all-female waiting staff should face the same more stringent licensing demands as sexual entertainment venues.Goard, talking amid the debris in the half-finished restaurant, confirmed that all his serving staff would be female and that the Hooters uniform was mandatory, but rejected claims that he was objectifying women.“Have you looked outside on a Friday night?” he said. “What else can I say about that? We raise millions and millions of dollars for [breast cancer] charities … If you want to go to TGI Friday, some people are saying it’s offensive because they’re dressed with [braces]. We’re not offensive in any way. It’s been [going] 41 years, we have hundreds of restaurants in 17 or 18 countries. But everyone’s got an opinion, everyone is entitled to an opinion as well.”The Newcastle Hooters will have a capacity for 200 people, but Goard suggested the brand would raise the standard of outlet on the Bigg Market, perhaps Newcastle’s rowdiest street. The council has been seeking to regenerate the area after years of decline.He said: “It’s a restaurant. We don’t want to be here as a bar … We do kids eat for free on Sundays. Hooters isn’t what you think it is, what you perceive it to be, until you come in the door.”Goard has hired 45 of the 50 “Hooters girls” he wants to hire, some of whom are as young as 17. They would be paid the national minimum wage or living wage, depending on their age, plus tips, he said, with “flexible” hours.Margins were tight in the restaurant business, Goard said. “Make money, you expand,” he added. “But it’s still dangerous, you know. People lose their livelihoods opening up restaurants.”A Newcastle city council spokesperson said: “We are aware of residents’ concerns about this development. Our licensing officers will be engaging with the current licence holder to determine their intentions for the property. We will also establish if further permissions are required to ensure compliance with the authority’s licensing objectives.“As a White Ribbon City, Newcastle stands against all harassment, abuse and violence against women and girls. All businesses in our city are encouraged to show their commitment to tackling these important issues and we will be raising it with the licence holder at these premises to ensure they understand our clear position.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastleFood & drink industryEnglandNorth of EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In others, she is reading, relaxing and sleeping, most often with a high-neck blouse, a ribbon or a scarf covering a tracheotomy scar.While her face is familiar, little else is known of the artist’s eldest child. Despite her fragile health, Marguerite joined the French resistance, was tortured by the Gestapo, faced deportation to a Nazi concentration camp, and remained a discreet and comforting presence in Matisse’s life until the day he died in November 1954, aged 84.An exhibition opening in April at the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris will bring together more than 110 works – paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics – featuring Marguerite, many from private collections and never before seen in public inFrance. “We think we know all there is to know about Matisse, but here we have an image of him that is completely unknown to the public,” Charlotte Barat-Mabille, one of the exhibition curators, told theObserver.View image in fullscreenHenri, Amélie and Marguerite Matisse in 1907.Photograph: Archives Henri Matisse“And while Marguerite’s face is very familiar around the world from Matisse’s portraits of her, apart from art experts and historians, very few people know much about her.”Henri Matisse, the son of a wealthy grain merchant from northern France, was working as a court administrator inPariswhen he was confined to bed after an attack of appendicitis at the age of 20. To combat the boredom, his mother bought him art supplies and he discovered what he called “a kind of paradise” in art, much to his father’s deep disappointment.Marguerite was born in 1894 during the painter’s relationship with one of his models, Caroline Joblau, when he was in Paris studying art. Unusually for the time, Matisse recognised the child when the couple split. Four years later, when he married Amélie Noellie Parayre, he brought Marguerite to live with his new family, where she was brought up with two half-brothers, Jean and Pierre.At the age of six, Marguerite contracted diphtheria and had an emergency tracheotomy. The damage to her larynx caused pain and discomfort for the next 20 years, interrupting her schooling and leaving her confined to home, where she spent hours with her father in his studio.Matisse’s portraits from this time show Marguerite wearing a black ribbon or high-neck blouses to cover the scar. The most familiar of these isMargueritewith a Black Cat, completed in 1910, and hailed as bold and radical when exhibited in Berlin and New York. Matisse preferred to keep the work rather than sell it.Matisse’s paintings and drawings of his daughter proliferated during the first world war and portray an elegant young woman, stylishly dressed and wearing elaborate hats. In 1920, Marguerite, then aged 26, underwent a final, painful operation to repair the scar on her neck and was subsequently painted without any accessories.View image in fullscreenMatisse’s Marguerite with a Black Cat, completed in 1910.Photograph: Georges Meguerditchian/RMN-GPThree years later, Marguerite married the writer and art critic Georges Duthuit. Although she had taken up painting and succeeded in being included in group exhibitions during the war, she stopped producing her own work in 1925, and devoted herself to being Matisse’s assistant and agent, meticulously overseeing the printing of his engravings, supervising exhibitions, cataloguing his work and dealing with demands for it.“As Matisse’s daughter, she was brought up with painting and it was natural to her. However, being Matisse’s daughter wasn’t easy, and although she had a natural talent and a good eye, she gave it up,” Barat-Mabille said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are very touching,” Barat-Mabille said.In 1935, separated from Duthuit and living alone in Paris with their toddler son, Claude, Marguerite attempted to forge a career as a fashion designer with a collection sent to be shown in London. It was not a success.During the second world war, she and her stepmother were active in the French Resistance. In 1945, Marguerite was denounced to the Gestapo in Rennes, and was arrested and tortured. After several months in prison, she was placed on the final deportation to the Ravensbrück concentration camp when Allied bombing disrupted the train carrying her and the other prisoners, and she escaped before reaching Germany.Matisse’s final portraits of Marguerite date from 1945, and reflect his concern over the danger and suffering she endured during the war.Marguerite Duthuit Matisse died in Paris in 1982, aged 87, while still cataloguing her father’s work.“As well as being an occasion to pay tribute and rediscover Matisse the artist, this exhibition allows us to see a more personal side to him. Here we see Matisse the family man and father,” Barat-Mabille said.Explore more on these topicsHenri MatisseThe ObserverArt (Education)PaintingMuseumsParisFranceArt (Art and design)featuresShareReuse this content"

England have been involved in a few thrillers in recent times but this one could not have had a more dramatic plot twist. The collective roar which greeted the decisive 79th-minute try by the replacement Elliot Daly, bursting unstoppably on to a short ball from his young fly-half Fin Smith, must almost have rattled the windows in Calais.Previously it had seemed England were about to lose another tight game when France’s precocious winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey went over for his second try six minutes from time. With barely 90 seconds left, though, England had one last chance and, in a set strike move off a lineout, Smith and Daly combined to clinch a result that transforms their team’sSix Nationsprospects.‘A vindication’: Maro Itoje hails England’s Six Nations win over FranceRead moreNo one could accuse England of fading away this time. Admittedly France were guilty of squandering an almost farcical number of try-scoring opportunities but the result, in the end, was richly deserved. Fin Baxter’s 69th-minute close-range try also dragged England back into contention but, crucially, the 22-year-old Smith slotted both angled conversions to seal the deal. The Northampton fly-half will remember his first Test start for the rest of his days.This result also buried the bitter memory of England’s53-10 humiliationin this same fixture two years ago. Their back row could not have done much more with Tom Willis doing his utmost to make his mark having finally been entrusted with the No 8 jersey. The collective Red Rose defence, for the most part, was again impressive.France, even so, will be kicking themselves after a 60th-minute try for Damian Penaud had appeared likely to prolong their unbeaten start to the tournament. Instead it is now England, fromunpromising beginnings in Dublin, who sit in a decent position, with two of their remaining three fixtures at home. This remarkable outcome will encourage them to believe a significant corner has finally been turned.It was due reward for their last-quarter resilience but, ultimately, France were also undone by the weather. It was grey and damp and not a day for overly-ambitious handling. Fortunately for England, France ignored that crucial detail. They contrived to butcher a succession of tries from an early stage, starting when Bielle-Biarrey would have scored had an over-clubbed final pass been slightly more accurate. The normally immaculate Thomas Ramos also missed some important points from the tee, with a greasy ball proving problematic for both sides.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Fin Smith, top right, celebrates after his conversion clinches the win.Photograph: Ian Walton/APEven the great Antoine Dupont had his awkward moments. The France captain had looked the calmest man in the ground in the tunnel before kick-off, a slight narrowing of the eyes the only real clue to the inner warrior. His genius is not just his range of skills but his shot selection and competitive instinct, all of which sets him apart from the average international player.But a bar of soap is a bar of soap and when Ramos threw what should have been a killer ball to his captain it ricocheted away off Dupont’s left arm and denied France a 90-metre screamer of a try. If England were fortunate to survive that near miss they were soon reprieved again when Penaud, with the line at his mercy, could not hold Matthieu Jalibert’s final pass.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

François Cros picked up a loose ball from what, at first glance, seemed an offside position but the referee waved play on and, even 45 metres from their own line, England were immediately in trouble. After some initial broken-field madness Dupont straightened the impromptu attack beautifully and this time Bielle-Biarrey finished expertly wide on the left from Penaud’s chip ahead.England simply had to respond, or at least start playing some of the game in their opponents’ half. Bang on cue they launched their most concerted attack of the game and, with France’s defence under the cosh. Ollie Lawrence took advantage to score under the posts. Marcus Smith’s conversion made it 7-7 at the interval, which England would definitely have taken before kick-off.Fifteen French handling errors and 10 turnovers conceded in the first 40 minutes alone were the most relevant half-time statistics and the outcome was always going to rest on whether the visitors could put their wastefulness behind them. Inside three minutes it seemed they were about to do so when another hopeful Marcus Smith foray resulted in a loose ball for France which Bielle-Biarrey seemed certain to finish.Under pressure from Ollie Sleightholme, though, the winger cut inside and lobbed a hopeful ball over the top towards his hooker Peato Mauvaka. All the latter had to do was catch it but, once again, a French fumble saved England. The buffet of wasted chances was becoming almost comical.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But this was the third quarter, the point at which England have seen so many games slip over the past year. A Ramos penalty, straight and true this time, put his side back in front and the white-shirted sections of the stadium collectively winced. They had surely seen this arthouse film before, particularly when England opted not to attempt a penalty kick at goal only to concede a costly ruck turnover.This time, though, their optimism was about to be rekindled. With 23 minutes left, Fin Smith launched a neat cross-kick to his right and his Northampton teammate Tommy Freeman stretched out to score. Marcus Smith’s conversion attempt curled wide but maybe England could still kick on? This time, thanks to Daly’s irresistible surge through Dupont’s despairing tackle and Fin Smith’s composure, the answer was a resoundingoui.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025The ObserverEngland rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This was reportedly rejected by the Welsh Rugby Union’s chief executive, Abi Tierney. Wales have not won a game since.When asked by the BBC why his team yet again failed to deliver, Gatland cited poor discipline and a lack of potency in attack. “It’s very frustrating,” he said. “We shot ourselves in the foot with the penalty count being 14-4. I know we got a few [penalties] at the end. We missed a couple of opportunities that we created and couldn’t finish off. So yeah, very frustrating.“I think we’ve been pretty clear on the messaging with the players. But when you look back at the replays and just think, [there were] a couple of soft penalties that were given away, a couple of kick chases were high [in contact], our scrum wasn’t as effective as it needed to be. But we created a few opportunities. We were also unlucky. Josh Adams had a couple of chances. So look, it’s very disappointing.“I think we’ve just got to be honest with ourselves. Some of the mistakes we made as a group, we have to focus on fixing those things. In a game like tonight, in those weather conditions, you’ve got to be as accurate as you possibly can. That means your discipline becomes really relevant, your kicking game and kicking to compete [become more important]. And then looking to take opportunities. They kept the scoreboard ticking over with the penalties.”On the future of Welsh rugby, Gatland was more upbeat, saying: “Hopefully there is an agreement with the union and the regions and I think its positive. We talked about the pathways and that is a plan for us going into 2027 and ’29. Hopefully that is implemented as soon as possible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kylian Mbappé and Julián Álvarez had looked out from Madrid’s front pages on the morning of the city derby, the media turning Marvel Comic, and they will probably be there on Sunday too but this isn’t over. The man they liken to a Mutant Turtle and the striker they call The Spider scored one each as another derby finished 1-1, leaving these two great rivals first and second inLa Liga, a single point between them, left to fight another day.Between them Mbappé and Álvarez had already scored 37 goals in their debut seasons; on a night that took a while to get going but did eventually become a real contest if certainly not a classic, they took that to 39. Atlético started in the ascendency then Real were revived.Real Madrid 1-1 Atlético Madrid: La Liga – live reactionRead moreUltimately, though, neither delivered the decisive blow: there was no dramatic final scene, no epic end, just a title race getting ever tighter and a feeling that the real fights were put off for another day with a growing cast. A win on Sunday would leave Barcelona two points behind Real, one behind Atlético.“This was a draw in which we will both feel we could have taken the points,” Diego Simeone said.If Atlético started on the front foot, the first half was a slow burn; the visitors were in control but there was a caution about them. While Real had no shots on target by the break, Atlético had only one, although it was sufficient to give them the lead. It came when Javi Galán’s cross from the left ran through the area and Aurélien Tchouaméni put a leg out and trod on Samu Lino’s foot.Quick GuideEuropean roundup: Dortmund lose, Leverkusen heldShowBorussia Dortmundslumped to a 2-1 home defeat againstVfB Stuttgartand finished with 10 men in a disappointing first game as coach for Niko Kovac that dropped his team further away from the Bundesliga's Champions League qualification spots.Kovac took over after Dortmund sacked Nuri Sahin in late January. Last season’s Champions League finalists are on 29 points in 11th, while Stuttgart are on 35 in fourth, the last of the automatic Champions League qualification spots.Stuttgart took an unexpected lead when the Dortmund defender Waldemar Anton turned a cutback into his own goal in the 50th minute. They doubled it with Jeff Chabot’s header at the far post just past the hour.The hosts, who were dominant after the break, cut the deficit with Julian Brandt’s low drive from a tight angle in the 81st but their efforts to get an equaliser were derailed when the defender Julian Ryerson was sent off with a second booking.Bayer Leverkusenstumbled to a goalless draw atWolfsburgto drop eight points behind Bayern Munich, the leaders, though Xabi Alonso equalled the all-time coach record for the league's longest unbeaten away run.The Spaniard rotated heavily ahead of their ninth game in 26 days, leaving Florian Wirtz on the bench initially. The champions clearly missed his attacking spark as Wolfsburg got more shots on target. The hosts even hit the woodwork with Kilian Fischer's powerful drive in the 74th and despite some late pressure and a golden chance in stoppage time by the substitute Wirtz, Leverkusen could not find a winner.In Serie A, Sergio Conceição was pleased his decision to \"gamble\" by still going for a win whenMilanwere reduced to 10 men paid off againstEmpoli.After a goalless first half, the Portuguese coach brought on attacking players Santiago Giménez, Rafael Leão and Christian Pulisic, before his side went down to 10 men with Fikayo Tomori's second yellow card in the 55th minute. Empoli were also reduced following Luca Marianucci's straight red card before Leão opened the scoring with a header off a Pulisic cross in the 68th minute and Giménez sealed the 2-0 win eight minutes later.\"The temptation at that moment [after the red card] was to take off a striker, to put in a defender, but I didn't do it,\" Conceicao told DAZN. \"A draw here is like a defeat for Milan, so I had to take the gamble.\"ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.At first it had gone unseen but there was a pause as the referee, César Soto Grado, put his finger in his ear. It had looked light, a little lazy too, a leg put out for no real reason, but the contact was clear and when the referee eventually went to the screen, he decided it was enough. “People in football don’t understand this,” Carlo Ancelotti said.From the spot, Álvarez clipped in the opener. Atlético tightened their control; the frustration might have been that it did not lead to more goals. It wasn’t so much that they were missing opportunities: there was no catalogue of chances and not one save from Thibaut Courtois; it was more that the positions they worked were then wasted, an imprecision in those key moments, the touch lacking when it was needed most. “We didn’t have the clarity we normally have,” Simeone said of a flaw they would not shake off all night and one they paid for.The teams had gone off to a strange silence at half-time, maybe even a resignation, but when they came back out the noise levels soon rose and Real awoke.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An Mbappé shot lacked the power of the run that preceded it and the momentum slowed a little. But with eight minutes left Vinícius escaped two lunges and clipped a ball to Rodrygo whose volley flew wide, that shot count up from zero to eight, and with a single minute to go it might have been nine and the victory.

There were plenty of Brighton supporters who would have justifiably viewed this fixture with some trepidation given their abject performance in the record7-0 Premier League defeatat Nottingham Forest. But despite falling behind to a dreadful error from Bart Verbruggen when he spilled Cole Palmer’s cross into his own net after just five minutes, a rousing comeback inspired by Georginio Rutter, their record signing, made it a night to remember against opponents that are not the most popular in these parts given recent history between the two clubs.Brighton v Chelsea: FA Cup fourth round – liveRead moreThere were wild celebrations when Kaoru Mitoma – who was the subject of a £61m bid from Al-Nassr during the transfer window – put Brighton ahead midway through the second half after Rutter had equalised with a clever header, with Hürzeler enjoying his moment of redemption as his side recorded their first win here since beating Manchester City at the start of November.“It was just what the doctor ordered,” said the Brighton manager. “We’ve had a tough week and the guys showed real character to come back after the start we had. It’s important to stay calm and not overreact when things don’t go your way.”Enzo Maresca felt that there had been a handball in the buildup to Mitoma’s winning goal but this was another disappointing away performance from his expensively assembled side, who have now gone five matches on the road without victory.“For sure we need to learn how to win games 1-0,” said Maresca, whose side also took an early lead last week at Manchester City. “It’s a shame but if there is something positive about this it is that now we can focus on the Premier League and Conference League.”Hürzeler’s watchword this week following the humiliation against Forest had been “intensity”, with the Brighton manager admitting that there had been some honest exchanges with his players in training. He certainly got a response, with the lynchpin Carlos Baleba impressing in midfield on his return from injury and Rutter providing some of the cutting edge that has been missing in recent weeks.View image in fullscreenBrighton’s Kaoru Mitoma lifts the ball over Chelsea keeper Robert Sánchez to give the home side the lead.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAMaresca usually likes to rotate almost his entire side for cup matches but this was more a hybrid team that featured six changes from the comeback win against Graham Potter’s West Ham last week and they lacked cohesion throughout. With the strikers Nicolas Jackson and Marc Guiu both out injured, Christopher Nkunku was ineffective in attack as Brighton comfortably closed out the win.Potter was one of 11 players or staff poached byChelseain the space of 17 months and the antipathy towards them clearly remains among the home supporters, with Moisés Caicedo, Marc Cucurella and Robert Sánchez roundly booed from the first whistle until the last. But they and Hürzeler could not have had a worse start as Chelsea were handed the lead inside the opening five minutes by Verbruggen’s blunder. The Brighton goalkeeper had already been called into a save when he tipped Palmer’s shot over the bar and there seemed to be no danger when Palmer volleyed the ball across goal from Jadon Sancho’s pass. Yet Verbruggen took his eye off the ball and it somehow squirmed out of his grasp.Fortunately for him, Brighton were level six minutes later when Rutter’s precise header found the bottom ­corner from Joel Veltman’s cross. Nkunku surprisingly decided against shooting when he was played in on goal and Palmer’s looping header from his pass missed the target in the closest Chelsea had come to restoring their lead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A 14th straight defeat has dropped them to 12th on World Rugby’s ­rankings, one place below Georgia and the lowest position in their history. In Roman rain, Warren Gatland’s Divine Comedy descended another circle.Perhaps the most damning point of all is that this never felt like a contest. The losing bonus point, procured at the death with a penalty try after two Italians received yellow cards, felt undeserving and failed to gloss over the preceding dross. Even with so much riding on this result, and even with the weather stifling Italy’s attacking threat, Wales simply failed to manufacture a challenge. Forget about a Plan B, Gatland’s team now appear bereft of any plan at all beyond aimless kicks, toothless carries and unjustified hope.Gatland has sympathy for nation’s frustration as sorry Wales slump againRead moreThey almost began with a dream start when, two minutes after the opening whistle, Tomos Williams raked a diagonal kick to the corner, where Josh Adams burst on to the bouncing greasy ball, only to spill it around his ankles a metre short of the line. The Wales scrum – bullied for most of the game – then coughed up a penalty and three minutes later Freddie Thomas lost his feet at a ruck, handing Tommaso Allan a shot at goal for an early 3-0 lead.Conditions forced the hands of both scrum-halves, who launched high balls into the back field at every opportunity. In theory this should have helped Wales find their feet. One-up runners could merely charge into walls or chase after contestable kicks. A curling Ben Thomas penalty drew them level on 17 minutes.But Italy had an extra gear and found a way out of the slugfest. Another dominant scrum gave Paolo Garbisi front-foot ball which the fly-half used to dart down the blindside before nudging a grubber for Ange Capuozzo. The flying winger who stunned Cardiff to set up a late winner in 2022 dotted down in style. Allan added the extras from the touchline and made it three from three when he nailed a penalty before the half-hour mark.For the second week in a row, Wales were ineffective at the point of contact. Taulupe Faletau, playing his first Test since the 2023 World Cup, added some heft, but the 34-year-old could not do it alone. Italy’s ascendancy was rewarded with a string of penalties that kept them camped in Welsh territory. When Evan Lloyd lost his feet in his own 22, Allan opened up the 13-point lead they would take into the break.View image in fullscreenDejection for the Wales players after Ange Capuozzo’s try in Rome.Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/APWales continued to shoot themselves in the foot, by either failing to execute the basics or choosing the wrong option. When they had a rare opportunity to strike from a five-metre lineout in the first half, they attempted an intricate move round the blindside which the Italians read like a book.Wales changed their entire front row at once. It didn’t help – Italy won a scrum penalty that Allan generously drifted wide of the poles. The struggling Ben Thomas – who plays in midfield for Cardiff – was replaced by Dan Edwards at fly-half. It didn’t help – the Wales backline was just as disjointed as it had been in the first half, as they seemed incapable of stringing together more than three phases.It was all so predictable, which is not inherently a bad thing. After all, most teams know what France and South Africa will do. It’s that Wales’s predictability is now coupled with rank ineptitude. Adams was sent to the sin-bin on the hour when he clattered Martin Page-Relo with a head-on-head challenge. Allan, after missing two kicks off the tee, then dinked an extra three points as Wales’s discipline unravelled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They also needed to keep Italy scoreless, which they failed to do when Faletau was guilty of infringing at the back of the maul, illegally disrupting the scrum-half under rugby’s new laws. Allan’s fifth penalty put the game to bed.Wales spent the rest of the game in Italy’s red zone and sustained pressure led to the prop Marco Riccioni and the lock Dino Lamb being shown yellow cards. A penalty try shortened the deficit to just seven. Better teams might have manufactured a snatch-and-grab draw with the two-man advantage. The best this Wales team can hope for at this stage is a sorry bonus-point defeat.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025The ObserverItaly rugby union teamWales rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Greed is football’s real shortcoming, not extra timeJonathan WilsonShootouts are the least bad way the game has found to settle drawn matches, but they should be a last resortSat 8 Feb 2025 15.00 ESTShareSo Uefa is consideringdoing away with extra time, at least in the knockout stage of the Champions League, another grand old tradition swept away as the arc of history bends towards the generation of revenue for the already wealthy. This is the way of the world and so it is the way of football, all that is great and glorious about the game desecrated to produce more content to be sold.But first, a caveat, an increasingly necessary one as middle age hurtles by. Is this about age? Are our responses to extra time conditioned by our formative years? My first FA Cup final was 1982, a drab game enlivened by Glenn Hoddle putting Tottenham ahead after 110 minutes and Terry Fenwick heading an equaliser five minutes later (Spurs then won the replay). TheSchumacher-BattistonWorld Cup semi-final in Seville came six weeks later: at 90 minutes it was 1-1, by the 98th minute it was 3-1 to France and by the end it was 3-3 and West Germany had won on penalties. The following year’s FA Cup final also went to extra time asManchester United drew with Brighton; although there were no goals in the added 30 minutes, there was the drama of Gordon Smith’s late miss.What becomes of diehard football fans who stop going to matches?Read moreBy the age of six, I was fully convinced extra time meant excitement and that it was a good thing, a view that has barely been challenged by the fact that five of the Africa Cup of Nations finals I’ve attended have finished 0-0 before being decided on penalties. Maybe this is just another example of football acting as a great nostalgic comfort blanket and everybody instinctively resisting any deviation from the game with which we fell in love.But what is the justification for scrapping it? That players are playing too much? How many periods of extra time do sides play over a season? Over the past two seasons, just oneChampions Leagueknockout tie has gone to extra time. That’s not why fatigue is such an issue. Players are playing too much because football’s authorities keep making tournaments bigger and inventing new ones. You want to spare players’ legs? Maybe don’t add two extra group games and a possible knockout round – the equivalent of 12 periods of extra time – to the Champions League. Maybe don’t create a Club World Cup, the winners of which would play the equivalent of 21 periods of extra time, plus any actual extra time.Is it so that everybody has a clearer time of when games end? Are we to believe that Uefa, the body that presided over the chaos of theChampions League finals of Parisand Istanbul and the Deutsche Bahn-fuelled farrago of Euro 2024, suddenly cares about fans?Do we want more football settled by something that is less than football?Is it to make scheduling easier for television companies? That’s possibly true, but it seems less of a concern when the video assistant referee is taking 10 minutes to determine when a ball has brushed an arm.And anyway, if this is television dictating such issues, it’s a clear case of placing the cart before the horse. Is it really a radical proposition to suggest the sport must always come first? The thought occurred afterTottenham’s victory over Tamworthin the third round of the FA Cup when some argued that not only had the abolition of replays denied the fifth-tier side a money-spinning replay, but their chances of pulling off a shock were significantly reduced by the tie going to extra time. On the one hand, that is true: a Premier League side will outlast a team of part-timers. But on the other, for the game to have gone straight to penalties would have felt gimmicky.No football, not even the third round of the FA Cup, should simply be about the generation of shocks. If that were the case, you may as well randomly select two games a round to be decided by the toss of a coin. Shocks are not good in and of themselves but because of what they say about the strength of the pyramid, and because of the real beauty of football, which is that diligence, application and organisation (and fortune), gives even much weaker sides a chance of eliminating a stronger side. Shocks must be earned, even if that just means the weaker team packing their box with 11 players and hurling bodies in the way of the ball.Nobody now can seriously believe that penalty shootouts are lotteries but, equally, they test one component of the sport. Penalties are a part of football but they are not football. They may be the least bad way football has found to settle drawn games, but they should be a last resort. Inevitably, the abolition of extra time means more games will be settled on penalties. Is that really what we want, more football settled by something that is less than football?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes it is – although that could be alleviated if referees were stronger on time-wasting than, say, Daniele Orsato was in Real Madrid’s win over Manchester City in the2022 Champions League semi-final.Even then, though, it was in extra time that Karim Benzema struck the winner. Or take the2022 World Cup final: would that have somehow been enhanced without extra time, without Lionel Messi’s second goal, without Kylian Mbappé’s third, without Emi Martínez’s last-gasp save from Randal Kolo Muani?View image in fullscreenJosé Reina is a hero in the penalty shootout as Liverpool’s players celebrate victory over West Ham in the 2006 FA Cup final.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PANot for the first time, there’s the sense of a sports administrator not trusting its own product: make it shorter, add lights and fireworks and music at every opportunity, chuck in gimmicks. People watch football because they like football, and if they don’t like football, why are you trying to make them watch it? It’s not medicine for a child, to be forced down with a dollop of sugar and strawberry flavouring.There’s no footballing argument for doing away with extra time. This is not nostalgia talking. Shorter does not necessarily equal better. Like so much else, this feels like cosmetic change under consideration because of a refusal to address the biggest issue, which is the vast disparities in wealth and revenue distribution. Perhaps it is a conservative position, but it really shouldn’t be seen as reactionary to believe that when addressing the future of football, the most important consideration should be football itself.Explore more on these topicsUefaInside footballChampions LeagueFifaFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s always more difficult when somebody scores in the last minute, those are the craziest ones to write!”Indeed, thanks to Villa taking a 3-1 lead inside 55 minutes, this five-goal thriller of a Women’s FA Cup tie did not present late drama but it was no less significant, as it delivered the Spanish coach her first victory in charge of Villa in her second game, and could provide her team with a platform to build on for the remainder of the season.Women’s Champions League tie predictions after the quarter-final drawRead more“It’s something to start from, with more hope, more confidence, and I’m happy for the win,” said Arroyo, whose first action upon hearing the full-time whistle had been to turn, with both fists clenched in celebration, to exchange a high 10 and a hug with Shaun Goater.Villa were 9-0 winners at home to lower-league Bristol Rovers in the previous fourth round of the Cup when playing under the interim leadership of the former Manchester City striker Goater, who has stayed on with the backroom staff. But there have been few other happy days for Villa this season, after a disappointing first half of the campaign and the departure of the manager, Robert de Pauw, in December.Enter the 38-year-old former Barcelona youth player Arroyo, who was forced to retire from playing at 22 because of injury. She has said that her side will want to have possession and press as high as possible when they don’t. Villa will hope she can reproduce some of the magic that helped her guide her former club Real Sociedad to the runners-up spot in Spain in the first of her four years in charge there.Her first game, at home to league leaders Chelsea, ended ina narrow 1-0 defeatafter a late own goal. On Saturday, her team were more confident on the ball, but they fell behind to Nikita Parris’s dinked finish in the 45th minute. Arroyo, standing in the technical area wearing a long, unbranded black jacket, which accompanied the modern-day manager’s increasingly popular white trainers, raised an arm in frustration when the opener went in, but within moments she was exchanging high-fives with everybody on her bench as Anna Patten bundled in from a corner to equalise, just before half-time.View image in fullscreenThe Aston Villa manager, Natalia Arroyo, celebrates at the full-time whistle.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PAIn Spain, Arroyo built something of a reputation for wise tactical analysis, so perhaps it was no surprise that at half-time she made subtle changes, particularly exploiting Rachel Daly’s No 10 role, and the hosts scored twice in the first 10 minutes of the second half, first through a Daly header before Chasity Grant’s powerful shot. Parris pulled one back but it was not enough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now they are in Tuesday’s quarter-final draw. Arroyo was a cup finalist with Real Sociedad last season and said: “Imagining to be close to Wembley will be a dream come true.

On Friday morning, I sat with a group of young renters in a community centre in London. They shared their heartbreaking stories of mould and damp in their homes. Previous governments refused to stand up for them, in part because they didn’t want to ask landlords to make a fair contribution. But this government believes in a basic principle – that every renter deserves a safe and warm home.That is why we announced thatwe will ask landlordsto invest in energy efficiency upgrades that will make homes warmer and cheaper to run. Half of landlords are already doing this and we think it is only fair and right that we ask all landlords to offer decent standards.In doing so, yes, we cut emissions by making homes more efficient, but the real prize is about confronting the cost-of-living pressures families face – standing up for renters and lifting hundreds of thousands of people out of fuel poverty. People voted for change and we are determined to deliver it. This is the climate policy this government believes in.Last Thursday, I was with the prime minister at the UK National Nuclear Laboratory in Preston, announcing aplanning statementto speed up the rollout of nuclear power. This is the route to economic growth, enabling our country to seize the opportunities of AI and clean tech. It is also about wages – many of the workers at the lab came on to the site as apprentices and now have skilled jobs with good pay. These jobs are all too few and far between in Britain, but clean energy offers us a route to bring them back.The net zero economy is the economic growth opportunity of the 21st century. That is why the chancellor has shown such leadership in driving forward with clean energy industries, establishing a national wealth fund to invest in cable factories and clean steel, supporting publicly owned Great BritishEnergyand backing investment in carbon capture jobs in the north-west and Teesside.Despite these facts, it is undeniable that the climate debate is more contested than it has been for years. Siren voices in the Conservative party and Reform UK say we should give up on action. But the truth is that we face a choice as a country: transform our societies with good economic growth in the interests of current and future generations, or give in to those who defend the economic and social injustices of the status quo as we hurtle towards climate disaster, with the Los Angeles wildfires andrecord January temperaturesjust the latest evidence.With the prime minister’s mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower, this government is taking a clear position in this fight. Every family has suffered during the cost-of-living crisis because of our dependence on fossil fuels. Unless we change, our country remains stuck on the rollercoaster of global markets, with wholesale gas prices in January 60% higher than a year ago, prices that will feed through to the bills of the British people.That is why we are racing to protect families with homegrown clean energy that we control – lifting the onshore wind ban, delivering a record-breaking renewables auction and giving the go-ahead to almost three times as much solar in seven months as the previous 14 years combined.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I diligently cut it backMore summer essentialsSat 8 Feb 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 19.38 ESTShareIn the late 1970s when my parents built the house I still live in, there was no forest. The property was a disused cow pasture, full of scrappy grass and weeds. My parents began planting trees before they began the house build, and now – in my lifespan, 47 years – it has grown into a forest. When I was a child we called my parent’s plantings “the garden”, implying a place managed by us. Cultivated, civilised. Somewhere along the way we renamed it “the forest”. A self-managed ecosystem we occasionally impinged upon – cutting back, cleaning up debris – but only when it made incursions into our actual house.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsIn the original house design, the garden was supposed to be the main feature. The rooms were all separate wooden modules built along an open central walkway, the garden growing between them. Almost half a century later, the house has been submerged in forest. We live in the undergrowth, far below the canopy. Staghorns and elkhorns and mosses and lichen grow on the tree trunks, the bromeliads endlessly reproduce. The tallest trees in our forest are more than 45 metres. They look ancient though they are not yet 50. My parents planted the forest but it feels timeless, eternal. They had a vision when they began but I don’t think they could have imagined just how big or beautiful or interconnected each tree they lovingly patted soil around could grow.An orchard: a place where you tame trees, or try to – an act of hope | Helen SullivanRead moreMaintaining a wooden house submerged in subtropical rainforest can sometimes feel like a full-time job.

When you opened the cupboard below the sink, it appeared normal but it had become suspiciously spongy to the touch. All the shelving would need replacing.We looked on – agog – as our handyman removed wheelbarrow loads of roots and composted soil from beneath our sink. Our kitchen cupboard was alive! The roots of the trees outside had grown between the slab and the wall, taking over the dampened particle board. Our forest had breached the boundaries of the house. Since then, we’ve been watchful. We dug trenches around the slabs so we could see if the roots were encroaching. The other day, lying in bed, I spied a thick tendril of philodendron spiralling inside an open wardrobe. How long had it been there? When did it break through?View image in fullscreenThe house was once ‘a disused cow pasture, full of scrappy grass and weeds’, Jessie Cole writesWhat is gardening if not a constant battle for control? Nature, rearranged. It is not uncommon for visitors to remark, “If this was my place, I would get rid of some of these trees.” The subtext being,this has gotten out of hand.For the most part, they are right. We have surrendered to the forest. Years back, we raised the white flag.Nowadays, we diligently preserve the house itself but there is no dominion over the trees. When I was little, the trees were little too, saplings – and we all grew together, from nothing much to something. We are close, we are kin. The trees are not ornamental, they are beings, our lives entwined. We try to live in harmony. Nonetheless, it takes a day to clean the gutters, and, of course, the leaf drop is unremitting, so it is also a surrender to the work of keeping the house safe and clean. Sometimes, a branch grows so low and bushy that it blocks access to my room. I diligently cut it back. Give a little, take a little. This is how things go.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Yes, we’ve had them. We’ve learned our house is sturdy enough to stand solidly beneath their weight, though one once lopped off our brick chimney on its way down. The crash it made was frightening – but the world is full of frightening things.There are parts of our property that have become truly wild. In my childhood, across a bubbling stream, we had a pristine Japanese garden, with a pond and a small pergola. There were giant boulders, artfully arranged, and manicured pathways. The forest has taken back this section. We could not preserve it. It was engulfed. In its heyday it was perhaps a folly, though we recall it fondly: the pond of flashing goldfish, the speckled trunks of the crepe myrtles. A vision once made manifest, if only for a decade or so. It lives on in our memory. You cannot, it turns out, hold everything.I never envisaged I would spend a lifetime embedded in a forest my parents planted, but sometimes you have to stick around to see things come to fruition. Some trees live hundreds of years. The magnitude of those lifespans is hard for the human mind to comprehend. How can we know, when we plant those seeds, just how extraordinary the trees might become?You can grow a forest in a lifetime. It can be grander and more sustaining than you could ever imagine. Visitors may gasp when they come to your home. Things may get out of hand. It is not too late to start something from scratch. It is not too late to dream. Plant a tree. Nourish it. We can’t know what the future may bring, but the trees know how to be a forest and – when we’re gone – they will prevail.Jessie Coleis the author of four books including the memoirs Staying and Desire, A ReckoningExplore more on these topicsTrees and forestsOpinionHousingRural AustraliacommentShareReuse this content"

There is something not right about surrogacy. The furore started with anInstagram post by Lily Collins: a picture of her new daughter, Tove, in a little basket, under which theEmily in Parisactor expressed “endless gratitude for our incredible surrogate”. Reaction split along predictable lines – those in favour of surrogacy, and those against.What was striking was that it also split along another fissure: Collins’s possible motives. It was OK, some felt, to use a surrogate if you have infertility problems. But not in order to keep your figure, help your career, or because pregnancy is taxing and you are rich enough to outsource it.People were also divided on the motives of the surrogate. All well and good if she was driven by a desire to help Collins and her husband. But not if the true reason was the need for money.Collins’s husband, Charlie McDowell,hit back at “unkind messages”, writing: “It’s OK to not know why someone might need a surrogate to have a child. It’s OK to not know the motivations of a surrogate regardless of what you assume.”But he would be wrong to think motives are irrelevant here. This row touches on a central problem with surrogacy. As with assisted dying, motives do matter. If surrogates are being coerced by financial need or by other people, that is a problem. If the rich are delegating pregnancy to others merely because they can, that is another.The trouble is – as with assisted dying – there are few ways to guarantee that someone is doing something for the right reasons. You cannot peer into people’s souls, divine their true reasons and legislate accordingly.There is a defensible version of surrogacy, involving commissioning parents who are genuinely in need and a “gestational carrier” who was not pressured by her circumstances. But there are many, many indefensible versions, and no sure way to guard against all of them. If some reasons for surrogacy are morally unacceptable, then so is the practice itself.Advocates tend to focus only on infertile couples yearning for a child. But there is no getting away from the fact that outsourcing childbirth is the preserve of the rich. It is increasingly common in Hollywood, for example:Sarah Jessica Parker,Nicole Kidman, Paris Hilton,Grimes, Khloé and Kim Kardashian, Priyanka Chopra, Rebel Wilson, Lucy Liu and Naomi Campbell have all reportedlyused a surrogateto have children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIf infertility is a good enough reason to use a surrogate, then why not preserving your career?Liu has said that her decision wasnot driven by infertility: “It just seemed like the right option for me because I was working and I didn’t know when I was going to be able to stop.”This may sound reasonable. If infertility is a good enough reason to use a surrogate, then why not preserving your career? But it is in this way that a “need” for a surrogate transforms into a “right”. If career goals entitle you to a surrogate, then how about failing to find a good enough relationship? Increasing numbers ofsingle men are employing surrogateson that basis. One Japanese businessman has accumulated16 surrogate children“because he wanted a large family”. Rational step by rational step, you enter a dystopian world.Motives also matter when it comes to the surrogate herself. For the vast majority, the driving force is unquestionably the need for money: most surrogates are hard-up young women in poverty-stricken countries paid to rent out their wombs. Some countries, the UK among them, have attempted to change the equation by only permitting “altruistic” surrogacy, where expenses may be paid and nothing more. But ethical pitfalls remain; potential wrong reasons abound.What if a surrogate is driven by the belief she is building an important bond with a couple, only to be cut off once her service is complete? There is every reason for clinics and would-be parents to encourage a special feeling of connection but no obligation to continue it after the baby is handed over. The “best” reason for surrogacy is the halo of pure altruism, which does not depend on how the commissioners then treat you. But we should question that motive in a world where female self-sacrifice has traditionally been glorified. In almost every country, women are far morelikely to be kidney donors, and men the recipients, even though kidney disease is more prevalent among women.At the root of the problem with surrogacy is the fact that human emotions, attitudes, connections and relationships are vitally important, but they cannot be controlled or enforced. We cannot ensure that the relationship between surrogate and would-be parents stays sweet. Neither can we diminish the bond that forms between birth mother and child.Surrogates suffer as a result. And so do children: without that immediate emotional bond, parents seem to find it easier to abandon them. There are too many babiesdumped with the surrogateor in orphanages when commissioners change their minds.Surrogacy is a booming industry – globally it is estimated at £14bn. Between 5,000 and 20,000 babies are handed over every year. British would-be parents are increasingly turning to commercial surrogates incountries blighted by poverty, where it is cheaper. The numbers ofBritons using both commercial and altruistic surrogatesis rising. We should view all this as a problem. Surrogacy can work well, but there are far too many risks it doesn’t.Martha Gill is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the process of dispensing junk food for the mind, his company and others broke the back of institutions, industries and regulations around the world.NowDonald Trumpis demonstrating what happens when this motto becomes the guiding principle of the most powerful office in the world. As old rules are trashed, norms disregarded, scores settled, jobs lost, funding stopped, allies goaded and deals made. No one can know for sure what will happen next.From the other side of the Pacific we watch with astonishment and wonder if it could happen here.Trump’s Gaza proposal crosses a red line. The Albanese government must reject it | Donald RothwellRead moreAs word about Trump’s plans to remake US governance, institutions and norms spread after the release ofProject 2025, the then presidential candidate said he hadnothing to do with it. Many thought its libertarian proposals were so outlandish, so destructive of the good values of public life, they would never land.But thebig lesson learnedfrom Elon Musk and the coterie of tech bros when demolishing the old order is that“ask for forgiveness not permission” pays dividends. Within a decade they made extraordinary fortunes and had reshaped the world in their image.Some of those men are now Trump’s closest advisers and this lesson is being applied with even less humility. The methods Musk used to gut Twitter and birth X are a template of how to intrude into systems, remove people, upend processes. As the congressional historianNorman Ornstein observed: “We are in the middle of a fast-moving putsch, a right-wing authoritarian coup, a five-alarm fire and our media are treating it like a little backyard bonfire.”So what would you do if you were one of the 74,999,166 people who voted against Trump, or even one of the 90 million who didn’t vote, maybe because you were worried and didn’t want to be later tagged as a troublemaker for not voting for him?What would you do when you sawfriends prompted to resign from their jobs,funding stopped for life-saving projects, attendance at your kids’ schools drop as those who were worried theymight be deported stayed home,convicted violent criminals released from jail?Australia has in many ways been made by people who when they, or their parents, sensed an intractable political catastrophe, got outAnyone with even a passing knowledge of history understands that norms and institutions are the sinew of democratic system management. When they are broken, and the checks and balances undermined, ignored or destroyed, the whole system becomes vulnerable. It can even collapse.During the soap opera of the first Trump presidency, those who had observed this elsewhere – Timothy Snyder,Masha Gessen,Anne Applebaumand others – sounded a warning bell. Snyder used the preferred list language of the day and broke the journey to autocracydown into 20 steps.It didn’t happen, the system bounced back, although the armed assault on the Congress on January 6 2021 showed that there were armed militias poised and ready – a crucial step in the establishment of many autocracies.The US may bounce back again, it may self-correct, the checks and balances may work but in the meantime a lot of damage will have been done.So when you see these things happening in your back yard, what do you do? Do you stay and try to ignore it, fight, organise, or think about leaving?Australia is an excellent object lesson in the benefits of leaving. This nation has in many ways been made by people who when they, or their parents, sensed an intractable political catastrophe, got out. Some of the superstars of Australian public life arrived in this way, recognising the impossibility of remaining in a country where long-established norms and values were jettisoned, they chose to make a new life here. To name a few: Frank Lowy, Jelena Dokic, Guan Wei, David Gonski, Fred Gruen, Dai Le, Yassmin Abdel-Magied, Colin Tatz, Michelle de Kretser, Ghassan Hage, David Pocock.We should be grateful that many of them arrived in a time before the bureaucracy complicated and delayed their journey, when family and friends could sponsor them. Now we advertise for students and workers and give them visas.What’s the idea behind Trump’s shocking new Gaza proposal? | Fiona KatauskasRead moreSo to return to my question, what would you do if you found yourself in the US, fearful and instinctively opposed to what is happening? And what can we do?At a national level the sweet-talking games of diplomacy need to be played. The US is too powerful to tackle head on, as thepresident of Colombia found.But for all the negative talk about immigration, Australia has acute skills shortages, for nurses, engineers, doctors, teachers, IT and construction workers.There is a talent pool of brilliant Americans who could be tapped – rather than seeing our best and brightest disappear across the Pacific, this is a moment to welcome them back and invite others to study here, to work in our hospitals, construction sites and research labs.Their determination to live their best lives here would no doubt help reinvigorate the place, as their forebears from other nations have done before.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian immigration and asylumOpinionMigrationAustralian foreign policyDonald TrumpMark ZuckerbergElon MuskcommentShareReuse this content"

They will cast you out on the street like a Dickensian mill owner and laugh as they do it – at least they will if you work in any sort of creative industry. We’re told this again and again, and the warnings might be right – America’s Authors Guild has even just announced plans for a trust mark to be stuck on book covers to show that the book waswritten by a human.Well, I’m going to turn the tables. My publisher is anxiously waiting for me to finish my new novel, a sequel to my previous thrillerThe Turnglass. So let’s see if AI can take the faff – the actual writing bit – out of creative writing.A quick check withChatGPTassures me that yes, it knows my previous book, so I inform it that the sequel begins with Shakespeare investigating the real-life murder of his friend Christopher Marlowe. Early on, Shakespeare encounters a Scottish villain beside a canal. So let’s fire up the AI.“‘Jamie MacIntosh,’ Shakespeare muttered, his hand instinctively moving toward the hilt of his poniard. ‘What foul wind has blown you into my way?’”So far so good.“MacIntosh grinned, his teeth flashing white in the dimness. ‘I might ask the same of you, Bard.’ MacIntosh stepped forward, his broad shoulders filling the alley. ‘Not so fast, Shakes. Word is you’ve been asking the wrong questions to the wrong people. That makes you a problem.’”Nice one, ChatGPT. That’s the stuff. One note, though: MacIntosh isn’tScottishenough. Try again.“MacIntosh stepped forward. ‘No sae fast, Shakes. Word is ye’ve been speirin’ th’ wrang questions tae th’ wrang folk. That maks ye a problem.’”Better! Now. A bit of gratuitous violence, please.“They slammed against the brick wall, dust and mortar cascading around them. Shakespeare brought an elbow down onto MacIntosh’s shoulder. He grabbed MacIntosh’s collar and twisted, using the man’s own weight to roll them both sideways – straight into the canal… ‘Damnation,’ MacIntosh spat. ‘Ye fecht like a deil.’”Not bad. Not bad at all. But, well, MacIntoshstillisn’t Scottish enough, if you ask me. One more try? ChatGPT is happy to oblige.“‘No sae fast, ye preenin’ Sassenach gobshite.’” Blimey.“Word is ye’ve been speirin’ th’ wrang questions.’ The two men circled each other, breath steamin’ in the cauld night air. MacIntosh roared an’ surged, only tae step on a particularly slithery haddock, which sent him flailin’ like a spooked highland coo afore he crashed onto Shakespeare.“Shakespeare shoved MacIntosh straight intae the edge o’ the canal… The Scot let oot a wheeze that sounded like a deflatin’ bagpipe. ‘Ach, Christ’s knees!’ he spat, wipin’ water frae his eyes. ‘Ye fecht like a deranged wild haggis wi’ a grudge.’”Right. Yes, I think that’s sufficiently Scottish.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It does.“Just as they separate, both men are ambushed by a gang of cutthroats. Forced to fight side by side, they realize they make a formidable duo.

The west must lift sanctions nowSimon TisdallCompeting interests and rivalries between regional powers threaten hopes of change after the fall of Bashar al-AssadSat 8 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 12.36 ESTSharePreviously undisclosed Pentagon plans forwithdrawing 2,000 US troopsfrom eastern Syria received scant attention last week, overshadowed by Donald Trump’s surreal Gaza pantomime. The troops help local Syrian Kurdish forces contain the residual threat posed by Islamic State jihadists, 9,000 of whom are held in prison camps. If the US leaves, the fear is of a mass breakout and, over time, a reviving IS terrorist threat to Europe, Britain and the west.The mooted American pullout is one piece in a complex Syrian jigsaw puzzle that is challenging friends and foes alike following December’s toppling of Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorship. Unlike Trump, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states – competing for influence – want to get more involved in Syria, not less. Europe wants a stable, democratic state to which refugees can safely return.Israel, aggressively paranoid, sees only potential threats, while vanquished Russia and Iran seek to regain a foothold.Caught in the middle isAhmed al-Sharaa, former al-Qaida fighter, leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist militia that ousted Assad, and Syria’s newly appointed interim president. On him, to an uncomfortable degree, depends the future of this devastated, divided country. Around him, the Middle East’s political geography and balance of power are being radically reshaped.One question predominates. The fall of Assad was a rare good news story in a region desperately short of hope. Is the opportunity this popular revolution represents now in danger of being squandered?Inmeetings with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,and Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, Sharaa said his priorities were to protect Syria’s territorial integrity, unite rival factions in a national army, create an inclusive, elected administration and rebuild after 13 years of civil war. The task is enormous, Sharaa is inexperienced. Some doubt he has abandoned his radical roots. Yet, lacking good alternatives, helping him is a gamble regional leaders have to take.Erdoğan, who backed the HTS rebels in their Idlib base, has his own selfish priorities. He hopes toexert long-term influenceover this former Ottoman possession. He wants 3 million displaced Syrians in Turkey to go home – and lucrative reconstruction contracts. Above all, he wants an end to what he views as the Kurdish terrorist threat.Sharaa’s proposed integration of Syrian Kurdish fighters – grouped in the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – into his new national armysuits Turkey. Erdoğan makes no distinction between the SDF and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency in south-east Turkey since the 1980s. Turkish troops occupy areas of northern Syria. And Ankara sponsors the Syrian National Army – ragtag Arab militias that frequently clash with the SDF.The cost of failure, measured in renewed chaos and misalliances, could be highTurkey argues that it canlead the fight against IS, so there is no need for US forces to continue collaborating with Syria’s Kurds – a dubious proposition. But that conceit appeals to Trump, who unsuccessfully sought a US withdrawal in his first term. Now Trump says, shortsightedly, that Syria is “not our fight”. And it’s true that a US decision to dump its Kurdish allies would remove a key irritant in US-Turkey ties.But there’s a snag – several, in fact. Syria’s Kurds understandably prefer to maintain the hard-won autonomy of their Rojava homeland. They don’t want to be absorbed into an army run by Sharaa, whose militia they once fought. And they have zero interest in helping Turkey crush the distant yet long-cherished dream of national self-determination in Kurdish majority areas of Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkey – even if, as is reported, the jailed PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, is ready tothrow in the towel.Once again, the Kurdish cause faces a turning point – and risks a simultaneous collision with Damascus and Ankara.Other regional actors may be happy to see Sharaa fail. Israel exploited the chaos surrounding Assad’s fall to devastate Syria’s armed forces. It has entrenched itsoccupation of the Golan Heights. Despite Sharaa’s calls for peaceful coexistence, Israel remains deeply suspicious of him and his ally, the Hamas-supporting Erdoğan, who is viewed as a possible future adversary. A weak, though not anarchic, Syriasuits Israel’s purposes.Assad’s former backers, Russia and Iran, still lurk menacingly in the shadows. After itshumiliating retreatin December, Tehran is talking about rebuilding influence via the back door, using “resistance cells” and covert networks. Russia, meanwhile, is shamelessly bargaining toretain its two military bases. In talks last month with Sharaa, whom Vladimir Putin spent a decade trying to kill, Russian diplomats were told that Moscow “must address past mistakes”. Sharaa also demanded that Assad be sent back from Moscow to face justice. But he was careful not to burn his Russian bridges. Western powers take note.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s truly daunting. Whatever his past record, Sharaa – and the Syrian people – needs help in the present, for thecost of failure, measured in renewed chaos and misalliances, could be high.Which is why another key problem – unconscionable delay in lifting Assad-era western sanctions – is so harmful and self-defeating. The EU, the UK,even Trump’s America, must stop prevaricating, stop calculating advantage and fully open the aid, financial, trade, security assistance and reconstruction spigots, working with local partners and the Arab states. It’s a rare opportunity to turn good news into alasting success story– and serve western interests by building a friendly, prosperous, tolerant, democratic Syria.It is a once-in-a-generation chance.

Ministers are also rightly focused on improving skills and education.No doubt these traditional routes for public investment in the hope of higher growth will be the basis of the chancellor’s budgeting ahead of June’s comprehensive spending review (CSR).But what if the government’s investment portfolio included funding for a holistic approach to helping the near-400,000 people in Britain struggling to cope with life – those with three or more identifiable and acute problems who live from one benefit cheque to the next?The extra expenditure could also target the million-plus people who have applied to see a therapist as part of the NHS Talking Therapies programme and have yet to start their first session.As a form of public investment, it could be evaluated in the same way as building a new railway line – with the costed benefits stretching over the next 40 to 50 years.A study by academics based atManchester Metropolitan Universityshows that a relatively modest funding boost – perhaps redirecting money already deployed in the welfare system – could turn around the lives of many who struggle, allowing them to become engaged citizens, rather than victims stranded in poverty, debt and despair.Strip away the target-driven assessment and deal with the many problems faced by those who are in dire need, and Whitehall will discover there will be two profound paybacks. It will release much-needed cash, because most of the people helped will not need the same level of support in subsequent years. And those around them who were hindered from making progress themselves – such as children in disrupted schools or family members who had to take on mental health caring responsibilities – can get on with more economically positive pursuits.This may frighten Labour ministers wary of rightwing anger at “nanny state” solutions, yet the research shows that a more holistic approach could reap £50,000 for each of the 363,000 people on the acute list – £18bn a year in savings.The project provides an antidote to finger-in-the-air, gut-feel, seat-of-the-pants policymaking. The fact that the academics named their umbrella organisation the “policy evaluation and research unit” tells us that. Their work also provides the evidence ministers need to win over a sceptical public – and to persuade cynical public sector managers who fear that cooperation is a way for other agencies to steal their time and funding (which is why they prefer to work in silos).Thurrock is a bust council but still found a way to set up an intervention programme which in its first two years saved £1mToby Lowe, one of the Manchester Met professors who advises public sector organisations across the world, says we have arrived at a consensus that public management is not fit for purpose. “Public service offers a transactional relationship, such that when a customer shows up, the public service asks ‘How much public service should we offer?’” he says. “As people access the service, they are sorted and put on to one of a number of pathways.“But there should be a whole-person relationship, and the public sector should ask the question, ‘What can be done for you?’”Everyone knows it would be better for someone fallen on hard times to be treated with care and understanding. What is becoming clear is that it also makes economic sense when the cost to society of employing public servants to behave in this way has a quick financial reward measured in billions of pounds.Thurrock in Essex is a bust council, but it still found a way to set up a “complex housing intervention programme”, which in its first two years saved £1m by taking a more joined-up approach to homeless people with a dual diagnosis of mental ill-health and addiction. The Manchester Met study identifies 35 similar instances where a more people-centred approach saved money without the use of targets.Given a chance, most public sector workers would prefer to end the cycle of procrastination and responsibility-avoidance that characterises much of their day-to-day existence. They would like to see improvements in all aspects of the public sector, not least because they use public services like anyone else.It’s the management culture that needs to change. There are experts inside Liz Kendall’s Department for Work and Pensions, Angela Rayner’s local government domain and the Treasury who understand that a government that is serious about tackling the intersection of low incomes and mental ill-health has not “gone soft”. It is a hard-headed route to more cash, not less.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsThe ObserverSocial careCounselling and therapyWelfareLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

They have become a permanent feature of the west London skyline; one that means the people who live and work in north Kensington – including those who survived the fire – are never far away from the reminder that 72 people died, and that this terrible loss of life was entirely avoidable were it not for a series of dreadful failures by the public bodies, private companies and regulators responsible for ensuring the safety of its residents.The question of what should happen to the tower was always going to be highly sensitive. Some survivors and family members desperately want it to remain standingas a memorial to those who were killed. Nabil Choucair, who lost six family members, says it should at least be allowed to stand until thecriminal investigation– still ongoing – has concluded. There are some local residents who say they find its continuing presence difficult and who worry aboutwhether it is structurally safe, following engineers’ reports that have said that the tower needs to be taken down above its 10th floor for safety reasons.Last Wednesday, deputy prime minister Angela Rayner told a community meeting that the tower would be dismantled entirely after the eighth anniversary of the fire, to be replaced by a memorial that could incorporate elements of it. The government rejected suggestions from some survivors that the lower levels should be allowed to stand, arguing this would be unfair to those with a connection to flats on the upper levels thathave to be removed. Grenfell United, which represents some survivors and family members, has been highly critical of the way the government has handled the decision process; another survivor group, Grenfell Next of Kin, attributed the best of intentions to Rayner.It is understandable and to be expected that some relatives find the prospect of the tower being taken down extremely painful, particularly given the fact that no one has yet been held criminally responsible for the fire; the outcome of any criminal trials is not expected until a full decade after it happened. Given this decision has now been made by the government, it remains critical that theGrenfell Tower Memorial Commission– itself mainly made up of elected representatives from the community – continues to engage with families and survivors with a range of views about what form the memorial should take.At the time the final report of the public inquiry was published, the government promised it would produce its response to the inquiry’s recommendations within six months; that response is due by early March. After a National Audit Office report last November called on the government to speed up the pace of remedial work onbuildings with dangerous cladding– seven years on from the fire, only a third of tower blocks have had the cladding removed, and half a million people are estimated tolive in dangerous buildings– ministers announced plans to bring forwards the deadline for buildings over 11 metres to be fixed or have a date in place for completion to the end of 2029. But that is still almostfive years away. And the government will need to undertake radical reform of the construction industry to avoid another lethal fire: the inquiry recommended setting up a new public regulator, with a single line of ministerial responsibility, to oversee building construction, including licensing companies involved in the construction of higher-risk buildings. Such a scheme will be expensive, but it is of paramount importance that the resources are found.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Who would have thought that sentence would ever be written? And yet, less than three weeks into Donald Trump’s second term, it is barely controversial to many people looking on from shell-shocked democracies beyond America’s shores. By his destructive, vindictive, illegal and irrational actions, Trump sets himself beyond the pale. In place of American exceptionalism, theworld must now learnto manage, and if necessary confront, a gross American objectionablism.Proof of these assertions is to be found in the White House’s daily outpourings. Seeking revenge against those who tried to punish his attempted 6 January 2021 electoral coup, Trump is weaponising the justice department by executive order. Political opponents, FBI agents, prosecutors,media outlets and journalistsare in his sights. In contrast, about 1,500 convicted Capitol Hill rioters have been pardoned. He has even had the gall towithdraw the security clearanceof his predecessor, Joe Biden, citing mental incapacity.Trump is treating federal government agencies like enemy territory to be stormed and purged of deep state, so-called woke and liberal elements. To this end, he has recruited the sycophantic billionaire, Elon Musk,and teams of youthful, unaccountable acolytesto physically take over offices and computer systems, suspend, lock out or sack civil servants and seize control of programmes and budgets. The treasury, the education department, the federal election commission and independent government watchdogs are all under the hammer wielded, principally, by Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”. Nor has the CIA and the wider “intelligence community” escaped Trump’s vendetta. It, too, faces mass firings under theproposed leadershipof Tulsi Gabbard, a Russia apologist. Putting theanti-vax conspiracy theorist, Robert F Kennedy Jr, in charge of health and human services demonstrates how little Trump really cares about ordinary people’s welfare.Diversity, equity and inclusion polices, in particular transgender rights, are under siegeTrump’s arbitrary,often unlawful ordersindulge other far-right obsessions. Diversity, equity and inclusion polices, in particular transgender rights, are under siege. He has demanded a halt to the rollout of EV charging stations, declared open season on wildlife and the environment by relaxing oil and gas drilling regulations, and withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement. He even wants to ban paper straws, preferring plastic. From an immediate international perspective, Trump’s decision to eviscerate USAid, the world’s biggest foreign aid provider, and the attempted sacking of nearly all its staff, is the most savagely objectionable misdeed of all.His freezing of USAid’s $42.8bn (£34.5bn) budget spells death or renewed suffering for millions of dependent people, from Sudan to Bangladesh to Ukraine. The US accounts for about $4 in every $10 spent globally on humanitarian aid. To the instant human toll, as Britain’s former prime ministerGordon Brown points out, must be added a loss of US global influence that will benefit authoritarian rivals China and Russia. “The era when American leaders valued their soft power is coming to an end,” Brown wrote. His view wasechoed by foreign secretary David Lammy, who described Trump’s mindless aid vandalism as a “big strategic mistake”.Trump’s egotistic rampage is causing widespread additional international damage and confusion. His on-off tariff wars with China, Canada and, prospectively, the EU; his militarisation of migration policy along the US border with Mexico; his imperialistic vow to seize Greenland by force from Nato ally Denmark; and his disdain for the UN, typified byhis withdrawal from the World Health Organizationand the UN Human Rights Council, are all decisions underscoring his broader contempt for the multilateralist, rules-based international order. Nothing more damningly illustrates that contempt than yet another outrageous executive ordersanctioning the international criminal court(ICC).Trump’s ICC attack was prompted in part by a wish to protect Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister and court-indicted war crimes suspect, who was feted at the White House last week. He used this occasion to unveil hismost absurd, most dangerous ideato date: a forcible “clean-out” of the 2 million inhabitants of Gaza and a US-owned “Riviera” real estate development amid the ruins of their Palestinian homeland. This wheeze is too ignorant, too insulting and too inhumane to be taken entirely seriously. Yet that has not stopped Israeli and US rightwingers using it as potential justification for wrecking the ceasefire, resuming the war and laying the ground for annexations in Gaza and the West Bank.Trump, the convicted felon, proves each day that he is unfit for the high office he holds. He aims to destroy the fundamentals of American democracy: the separation of powers, civil and voting rights, secularism, free speech and equality under the law. He is a menace to global peace, stability and prosperity.Pushback has begun, largely through the courts. Yet afew defiant judgescannot win this huge, rapidly developing struggle. The Democrats, stunned into virtual silence, must wake up. Meanwhile, Britain and the western democracies must take a united stand. So far, Keir Starmer and his ministers have been too circumspect. They must be bolder and braver in their criticism and in upholding British values.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Officials are urging countries instead to take time to work harder on their targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions and divest from fossil fuels.Simon Stiell, the UN’s top climate official, said in a speech in Brazil on Thursday: “Because these national plans are among the most important policy documents governments will produce this century, their quality should be the paramount consideration … Taking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense, properly outlining how they will contribute to this effort [to tackle the climate crisis] and therefore what rewards they will reap.”New national plans on emissions cuts are urgently needed because current targets are dangerously inadequate. The world must cut carbon by about half this decade, relative to 1990 levels, to have a chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, the important threshold thatscientists fear is already out of reach.Chart showing the impact of climate pledges on emissions and heatingGovernments are working to blueprints set out four years ago thatwould result in temperature rises of 2.6C to 2.8Cby the end of the century, according to the UN’s environment programme. Poor countries want to see far faster action from the G20 group of the biggest developed and emerging economies, which are responsible for about 80% of global emissions.Ilana Seid, Palau’s ambassador to the UN and the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: “It is essential that the G20 and other large emitters exhibit their leadership with new [national plans] that show ambitions and tangible progress. We need deep, rapid and sustained reductions commensurate with the 1.5C goal. In this time of unprecedented climate crisis, more than ever we need enhanced international cooperation to truly move the dial forward.”Ali Mohamed, the chair of the African Group of Negotiators and Kenya’s special envoy for climate change, said: “It is unacceptable that this devastation [that we are seeing] is caused by the pollution of just a few countries, specifically the G20, and they must take responsibility for their actions.”Chart showing the concentration of planet-heating pollutants in 2023Given the climate emergency –temperatures exceeded 1.5C above preindustrial levelsfor a whole year in 2024 for the first time – any delay to the deadline would usually be regarded as a crisis. But this year the world is facing a more immediate potential disaster in the US presidency of Donald Trump. Not only has he withdrawn the country from the Paris agreement, he has also embarked on a trade war with the imposition or threat of heavy tariffs on imports.This has thrown important trading relationships, including that withChina, into disarray. The disruption to geopolitics, already in turmoil after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza, has alarmed climate diplomats. Many privately believe putting off the publication of national plans, at least until Trump’s initial flurry of activity has died down, is preferable.Under the2015 Paris climate agreement, every five years countries must submit detailed plans – callednationally determined contributions (NDCs)– with clear targets on cutting emissions, or curbing them in the case of poorer countries. These are then discussed at a “conference of the parties” (Cop).Last time, the deadline was in effect extended by a year: the Cop26 conference in Glasgow was postponed from November 2020 to 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This time, the deadline is technically 10 February – nine months before theCop30summit in Brazil this November – but with only a handful of countries so far having submitted plans, it looks likely that most will miss it.Stiell has urged countries to file their submissions before September, when experts will prepare an official “synthesis report” showing whether the aggregated plans are sufficient to meet the 1.5C limit.View image in fullscreenActivists urge world leaders to commit to a strong climate finance deal at Cop29, in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024.Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/ReutersAmong thedozen or so countries that have submitted their NDCs so farare Brazil, the host of Cop30; the United Arab Emirates, the host of Cop28 in 2023; and the UK, which under the new prime minister, Keir Starmer, has promised to show climate leadership.One of the last acts of Joe Biden as US president was tosubmit a new NDC, but that is now largely symbolic. It will stand as a benchmark for those US states, local governments and businesses that maintain their climate commitments in defiance of the federal government.Given the impetus in the US behind renewable energy, electric vehicles and other low-carbon technologies, its emissions trajectory may not alter much under Trump for some time. But the impact of his return will be felt far beyond the country’s borders: petrostates and economies that have been laggards in cutting emissions may take cover from his shredding of climate commitments.Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser now with American University’s Center for Environmental Policy, warned: “Tragically, Trump’s re-election will not only mean the temporary curtailment of US climate ambition, but it will take some pressure off China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and other major traditional scofflaw emitters, who are likely to offer less ambitious NDCs than had Democrats won last November.”China holds the key to Cop30: it is the world’s biggest emitter by a wide margin and responsible for almost a third of global carbon output – more than all of the developed countries combined. It has invested heavily in renewable energy, and the past two years have broken records in additional clean power generation capacity, with that pace likely to continue this year.Chart showing the top emittersYet emissions are still rising, albeit at a much slower rate. To meet the global carbon budget would require China to cause its emissions to peak this year, then fall by about a third by 2035. Such drastic cuts are possible, experts say. Li Shuo, the director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said: “We believe China is very well positioned to achieve that goal, based on its very rapid low carbon development.”Whether China grasps those opportunities will be a political decision. Within Beijing’s top echelons of power, tumultuous arguments rage between those who want to push harder still for the burgeoning green economy, and the advocates of coal. Calculations of the impact of Trump, and his tariffs, will fuel those disagreements further.“The US backsliding is definitely not good news for China’s climate ambition and global climate action,” Shuo said. “But China is at the very forefront of the low-carbon economy, which is already yielding a lot of benefits. And China wants to project stability and predictability, on the international stage.”View image in fullscreenA man takes photos as a thick haze engulfs the Forbidden City in Beijing. Despite improvements, air pollution in Chinais still far worsethan in many developed countries.Photograph: Roman Pilipey/EPAChina was at a similar crossroads nearly a decade ago: in early 2016,analysts estimated that China’s emissions may have already peaked. Instead, the country made a sharp reversal byreturning to coal-fired power. That process began before the election of Trump in November 2016 but was confirmed by his anti-China stance. Could Trump’s second ascendancy trigger a similar retrenchment? “I would not rule out a return to coal,” Shuo said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But China has made major investments in clean energy, and its economy is no longer driven solely by coal interests. The signals so far suggest it plans to stay the course.”India, the world’s fifth largest economy and third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will also be closely watched. After the gavel came down atCop29 in November, India’s negotiator criticised the $1.3tn climate finance deal agreed there as a“travesty of justice” and “betrayal” of developing countries.View image in fullscreenJustin Trudeau is greeted by Narendra Modi in Delhi, in September 2023.

B, b but the powerful coal lobby enjoys favour with the authoritarian prime minister, Narendra Modi, who argues that developed countries must take responsibility for cutting emissions while the developing world should expand its carbon footprint.Climate diplomats told the Guardian it was likely India would frame its targets in terms of emissions intensity rather than absolute cuts to carbon – that is, reducing the amount of carbon per unit of GDP.For most of the past two decades, the EU has led the world on climate ambition. This year, however, with a populist backlash across the continent threatening the environmental consensus, the two biggest champions – France and Germany – are in the throes of political crisis, and several other governments have taken a rightwing and anti-climate turn. The bloc is not expected to reach agreement on its NDC until this summer.Japan’s prospective NDC has been criticised by campaigners as too weak but it has not yet been submitted. Canada is facing elections after theresignation of Justin Trudeau, and Australia is also gearing up for political fights over climate in the long run-up to its election.There is little hope of strong NDCs from two of the biggest climate influencers among the G20: Russia and Saudi Arabia. Neither country is likely to commit to significant cuts, although both are nominally signed up to a net zero target.View image in fullscreenDevastation caused by the Palisades fire in Los Angeles, California, last month. The climate crisis has increased the risk of wildfires, say experts.Photograph: David Ryder/ReutersEven if China, India, the EU and some other G20 states come forward with relatively strong NDCs, the chances that they will add up globally to the drastic emissions cuts needed to keep the 1.5C target safe are small. Rachel Kyte, the UK’s climate envoy, said: “When you add up all the NDCs, my expectation is they may not get us back on track.”But this need not be the disaster it might appear, she added, as the NDCs could be negotiated and updated. For instance, some NDCs were likely to contain a range of possible targets, some of which might be conditional on countries receiving finance or other support. “These are not static [documents], and the targets are floors, not ceilings,” she said.Quite how dynamic countries are prepared to be is up for debate. AtCop26, countries – in theory – agreedthat NDCs should be updated more often than every five years. But since then, few have increased the level of ambition in their plans.Even if ambition is lacking on the core carbon targets in NDCs, properly focused plans could offer the world a breathing space by going beyond carbon to other greenhouse gases – chiefly methane. Global emissions of methane, which comes from agriculture and escapes from fossil fuel extraction sites, have been rising strongly in recent years, to theincreasing concern of scientists, as methane is roughly 80 times more powerful at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.Chart showing the annual carbon emissionsCutting methane yields big rewards:halving methane would avoid a 0.25C rise in temperatures by 2030, one study found. Durwood Zaelke, the president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: “Methane is the emergency brake that can slow down warming enough to keep us from going over the cliff of irreversible tipping points. All countries need to target methane in their NDCs.”Some countries already had policies on methane, which should be strengthened, and those without must put them in place, he said. “Our window to act is the next five years, 10 tops. If we don’t cut methane now, we’ll see the rate of warming continue to accelerate, and we’ll soon be past the first series of irreversible tipping points.”NDCs are detailed documents, going far beyond the headline emissions targets. Experts also want them to address the global imperative to “transition away from fossil fuels”,agreed at Cop28. All countries are supposed to be tripling their renewable energy generation and doubling energy efficiency, but so far those targets are being missed.Kyte said governments should see NDCs as an economic opportunity. “NDCs should be investable plans,” she said. “And investable plans for sustainable development can be NDCs.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisCop30Cop29Paris climate agreementDonald TrumpTrump administrationFossil fuel divestmentnewsShareReuse this content"

It appears to be just another multibillion-pound corporate giant, with London headquarters in Canary Wharf and interests stretching from Tibet toUkraine.Its lengthy financial accounts are full of prosaic details about ­mineral weights, rare metal assets and ­exploration plans.Yet the apparently innocuous ­multinational is not at all what it seems. In fact, it is linked to both a bizarre project to invent a new nation, as well as a very real attempt to seize control of a Ukrainian goldmine.The case is now being held up as a prime example of how lax rules at Companies House, the UK’s ­official register of companies, are creating opportunities for potential fraud both in the UK and around the world.A passport for the putative Union State of British Commonwealth, which a director of Gofer Mining appears to have declared a country.On closer inspection, GoferMininghas not filed accounts for several years. One of its directors is listed as the “Duke of Commonwealth”. With a little more digging, things take a ­further surprising turn. That same director also appears to have declared his own country.The Union State of British Commonwealth, an apparent collection of citizens from countries including Britain, China and Russia, claims to have already issued 10m passports.Like many jurisdictions, it comes with its own central bank and supreme court. A series of UK MPs and peers are listed among its associates,according to its website. It has its own currency – the Commonwealth pound – and its leader, His Highness the Duke of Commonwealth, is said to have descended from the Greek royal family, as well as a Russian prince, and personally gave about £292bn in assets to the public.The Union State can be written off as the curious online fantasy of its eccentric founder, known by several names, including Michail Roerich.However, a detailed analysis of accounts filed at Companies House relating to Gofer Mining, for which he is registered as a director and chief financial officer, suggests ­something more troubling – namely, evidence those accounts have been falsified.More concerning still is the ­revelation that Gofer Mining was involved in a lengthy attempt to seize control of a Ukrainian goldmine, eventually blocked by the Ukrainian courts in 2020.Those behind the attempt even managed to place an advert in theTimes, falsely stating that that Gofer Mining had been formed by Barclays bank and would invest £250m in the mine.View image in fullscreenDan Neidle of the Tax Policy Associates thinktank said that there was a need for a proper enforcement of UK company law.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianTheObserverhas learned that in 2019 the British Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce contacted Companies House to warn it about Gofer Mining’s activities in Ukraine. “Those behind this improper takeover are using Gofer’s Companies House listing online,” it wrote.Campaigners say that the ­sprawling case highlights how weak checks and a lack of enforcement are allowing suspicious directors and ­companies to sit undetected for years on the books at Companies House. They compare the UK’s companies register to a “wild west” that makes life easier for potential fraudsters.“Gofer Mining’s accounts are on another level,” saidDan Neidle, the former senior tax lawyer and founder of the Tax Policy Associates thinktank, who has been investigating the extent of fake companies and falsified accounts lodged at Companies House.View image in fullscreenThe fake advert Gofer Mining placed in the Times announcing the formation of the company.“There’s nothing in the accounts which is definitely an alarm bell, until you get to the auditor. Someone has faked an audit.”Neidle discovered that Gofer Mining’s most recent accounts were audited by a company called Smith Barclay LLP – a firm that links back to Roerich himself. No trace can be found of the named auditor, James Whitelaw.Meanwhile, there is no evidence of Gofer Mining’s 4,000 alleged employees. Its Canary Wharf address is also false. Yet despite all this and its involvement in the Ukrainian goldmine case, Gofer Mining remains a live company.It has not been struck off, despite being an allegedly large multinational whose last filed accounts covered 2019.In fact, Gofer Mining was found to be associated with a complex network of current, dormant or defunct companies that collectively claim to have billions sitting on their balance sheets or tied up in shares.Another such business was the now defunct British Technology Bank, which falsely claimed to have been part-owned by the Bank of England.In 2023, the Financial Conduct Authorityissued a warningthat it might be providing financial services or products without its authorisation and was targeting people in the UK.Roerich, one of several Gofer Mining directors, said he owned “less than 1%” of the company and disputed that its accounts had been falsified.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it is understood that there is no British Office for Ukraine with real links to the UK government.Labour peer Charlie Falconer, who is listed as chair of one of its ­committees, had never heard of it and had no association to it.Asked if he accepted that Gofer Mining’s ­purported auditor Whitelaw is not, and never had been an authorised chartered accountant, Roerich said: “Yes, I accept, as far as I know.”He said that Gofer Mining’s alleged auditor, Smith Barclay LLP, was now dissolved and that he had “never signed any documents as an accountant and/or auditor”.The purpose of creating the Union State of British Commonwealth and its associated central bank and supreme court remains unclear.Several former and sitting parliamentarians are listed on its website as being among its “people”. One of them isformer chancellor Nadhim Zahawi. He confirmed he had “zero knowledge” of it and would be informing “the authorities and my lawyers”.Neidle said there was a need for proper enforcement of company law, especially around the apparent ease with which false information could be lodged at Companies House.“The fact that we are such a business centre makes us an obvious target for fraudsters,” he said. “The fact that Companies House is so open and works so well makes it a juicy target – and the lack of controls makes it a juicier target still.“There needs to be some serious thinking around how to give reassurance that, when you see audited accounts on Companies House, the auditor exists and has a licence. Right now, it’s a wild west – and it doesn’t have a sheriff.”Fakers, fast sign-ups and fraud: the crisis at the UK’s Companies HouseRead moreCompanies House said it took allegations of fraud against the register seriously and that “all allegations are fully investigated”. They said the body was already usingnew powers that came into force last yearto “crack down on the misuse of the register by querying information provided by companies”.“Where incorrect, suspicious, or fraudulent filings are made, we will take appropriate action,” they said. “We proactively share information with other relevant government agencies and law enforcement.We are developing systems and processes to enable more checks to determine the accuracy of information delivered to us before it is placed on the register.“We will introduce compulsory identity verification checks for new and existing directors (and equivalents), people with significant control, as well as those filing information with Companies House.“This will provide greater assurance regarding who is setting up, running, owning and controlling companies in the UK and make creation of anonymous corporate structures that facilitate crime, corruption and fraud far more challenging.”Explore more on these topicsMiningThe ObserverCorporate governanceIdentity fraudScamsBankingUkraineRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

The site could soon be turned into a Chinese embassy.China bought the site and has proposed turning the two hectares (five acres) of land into the largest embassy in Europe.Tower Hamlets councilrefused planning permissionin 2022, citing a range of concerns including the impact of large protests at the site. The Conservative governmentdeclined to intervene.Beijing resubmitted the application after Labour came to power and the government called it in after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, raised it directly with Keir Starmer. Cabinet ministersYvette Cooper and David Lammy have signalled their support for the proposaland a local inquiry hearing will begin next week.View image in fullscreenProtesters against the proposal for a Chinese super-embassy.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverThe final decision rests with Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary.Those protesting, including many people from Hong Kong who have sought refuge in the UK, expressed concerns that the embassy could be used to “control” and illegally detain dissenters.Tai, 50, a carer, said: “We come from Hong Kong. We are afraid that China will use this place to look over us, against us. In Hong Kong, we have many experience of China, the CPP, controlling the freedom and democracy and against the Hong Kong people. We all face this.”He expressed concerns that the embassy could be used by the Chinese government “to control the Hong Kong people who live in the UK”, adding that: “People leave Hong Kong because they are afraid of the CPP.”Another protester, who gave her name as Mitochondria, 20, expressed similar concerns. “It’s very possible that this building could be used for holding Chinese dissidents who are on British soil to be arrested in a non-legal way,” she said. “A mega-embassy would enable that to happen.”View image in fullscreen‘Mitochondria’ said a mega-embassy could be used for ‘non-legal’ arrests of Chinese dissidents.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverShe held a blue and white Uyghur flag. “The Chinese government has imperialist interest where they occupy the land of East Turkestan,” she said.“There’s a genocide ongoing of the Uyghur people, the Muslim people in East Turkestan. They shouldn’t be oppressed. This is why I am holding the flag because we are in the same fight against the same authoritarian government.”About halfway through the demonstration, officers dragged a woman to a police van. A large group of protesters dressed in black surrounded the van in an attempt to block it from leaving, shouting “let her go”.Another woman appeared to have become unwell and was seen lying on the rain-covered road.Fred, 29, an engineer, expressed concerns the building could be used “to catch people inside the embassy and do espionage”.“We are the beacon of freedom in the world. It’s a shame to see this beautiful compound, our legacy, our pride, fall into a dictator’s hands.”View image in fullscreenProtesters at the Royal Mint Court, site of the former headquarters of the UK’s coin maker.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverA number of high-profile politicians including Iain Duncan Smith, Tom Tugendhat andLabourMP Blair McDougall also spoke to protesters. Tugendhat, the former security minister, said allowing the embassy to go ahead would be a “grave mistake”.“It would be a very clear statement that our government had chosen the wrong side and not the side that was for the defence and protection of the British people and our economic future.”He said letting the plans go ahead would send a message to the world that the British government “hasn’t learned the lessons of the last decade” and “just hasn’t been listening”.Tugendhat told reporters: “The reality is some people made decisions in 2010, 2013, you can understand at the time. You can see the hopefulness and the optimism with which they approached it.“To have that same optimism in 2025? It’s not optimism any more, that’s just a wilful ignorance.”Explore more on these topicsLondonChinaUyghursPlanning policyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

In 2024 the previous government passed the Pet Abduction Act, which included a maximum five-year prison sentence for offenders.View image in fullscreenDaisy the labrador in RSPCA care.Photograph: RSPCA/PAKim Walters, an RSPCA inspector, found Daisy, now 13 years old, with untreated mammary masses more than 200 miles away during routine investigations in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, on 2 February.After taking Daisy to a vet, the inspector discovered the labrador’s microchip, where she found contact details for the Potters. The couple could barely contain their emotion when Daisy was returned to them at their home in Old Buckenham on Thursday.Rita Potter, 80, said she and her husband were “so, so grateful” to the RSCPA for reuniting them with Daisy, adding their pet would be given “lots of love and attention”.“We kept a photograph on the mantlepiece and would look at it every day, thinking of her and where she might be. So it is an absolute dream come true that the RSPCA found her and have returned her to us – where she belongs – we are so, so grateful,” she said.Walters, the inspector who found Daisy, urged anyone with information about the theft to contact the RSPCA or the police.View image in fullscreenDaisy with RSPCA inspector Kim Walters and behavioural welfare adviser Andy Cook.Photograph: RSPCA/PA“I was a bit choked from listening to them and clearly how much they loved her, so it was great telling them that we could get her back home soon once we had made sure she was fit enough to travel and we had arrangements in place for the four-hour journey to take place,” she said.Buying puppies from unknown sources ‘devastating’ to welfare, Kennel Club saysRead moreWitnesses said they saw Daisy being bundled into a truck near the Potters’ house by suspected backyard breeders. Backyard breeding is described by the RSPCA as “the irresponsible breeding of animals in inadequate conditions with insufficient care”.The couple reported the incident to the police, but the vehicle’s number plate could not be traced.The theft of Daisy was reported far and wide and even gained the attention of Hollywood actor Tom Hardy, who shared the couple’s social media posts.“We know she is elderly now and has health issues, but whatever time she has left, she will now be surrounded by lots of love and attention,” Rita Potter said.“The whole family was so excited to hear the news that my grandchildren went to buy her toys and treats – she also now has not just one but two comfy beds.”Explore more on these topicsNorfolkPetsDogsnewsShareReuse this content"

Somebody’s stabbed the kids.’“I said: ‘What do you mean?’“She went: ‘It’s really bad. You need to get here.’“I just ran. I left the whole house open and got in the car.”Stancombe added: “It’s a five-minute drive from ours and we must have got there in a minute. We kept our hands on the horn, going faster and faster, jumping every red light on the road, we were on the other side of the road, people throwing their hands up to us.“I just didn’t care, I just kept whacking the horn. We got there and just deserted the car in the middle of the road and just ran.“And by that point police started trying to push people back.”Bebe King’s parents – who cannot be named for legal reasons – had been preparing for a wedding the following day.Her mother recalled being in Marks & Spencer when she received a phone call from her husband, who had arrived early to collect their daughter.She said: “I was about to put my card in the machine, and he called. ‘I can’t believe I’m telling you this but somebody has gone into the dance class with a knife.’She ran outside and jumped into a taxi. The driver dropped her off at the end of the street “and I just ran”.It emerged last month that Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time of the Southport attack,was referred three times to the Prevent programme.One of the referrals followed concerns about his potential interest in the killing of children in a school massacre, it is understood.Elsie’s uncle, Chris, told the newspaper: “The bottom line is the perpetrator was a child.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Notwithstanding some people are just born that way. But having access to such hateful information at their fingertips – from day one that’s what we said was a factor.”During sentencing, the court heard a summary of the prosecution’s evidence along with the judge’s sentencing remarks and details of the victims’ injuries which were broadcast live.Chris said: “The sentencing shouldn’t have been televised.”Bebe’s father added: “We know it has to be heard in court but why did the whole nation need to see it on television?”Bebe’s family did not attend court during the sentencing. “We didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of seeing us,” her father added.Both parents also paid tribute to their daughters.Stancombe said it was an honour to be Elsie’s mother“Everything she did was pure enthusiasm. It could be the most boring thing – even, like, David taking the bins out – and it was like: ‘I’ll come!’ She was grateful for life.”The Stancombes have set up a charity, called Elsie’s Story, to help children in need.King’s mother said of her daughter: “She would come out with the most random stuff. She would do it and look at you and laugh as if to say: ‘I’m dead funny, aren’t I?’ She would give you this hug and say: ‘I love you, momma.’“She was the best.”Explore more on these topicsSouthport attackChild protectionChildrenInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

It is under fresh scrutiny over its dividend payments.Thames Water– long accused of favouring the interests of its ­shareholders over its 16 million ­customers –faces an £18.2m penalty from Ofwat over ­dividends it paid out, including an intra-­company payment of £37.5m in October 2023.TheObserverandDemocracy for Salehave established that officials were concerned before the dividend was paid that Sir Adrian Montague was the chair of both Thames Water and its controlling company Kemble Water Holdings. Thames Water insisted this weekend there was no conflict of interest.Steve Goodrich, of Transparency International, said: “There are ­serious questions as to how this ­conflict of interests was allowed to go ­unchallenged for so long.”Montague was appointed to the boards of Thames Water and Kemble Water Holdings on 10 July 2023. Both firms were already in severe financial distress.Government officials thought that “Adrian’s chairmanship of both Thames Water (regulated entity) and its holding company (Kemble) may put him in a conflicted position”, according to a briefing document.The July 2023 note prepared for a meeting between Montague and officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) stated: “The company and its directors may well need to make decisions that diverge from the interest of shareholders.” Montague, an experienced City “troubleshooter”, had already told Ofwat he would step down if a conflict “was to arise”, it shows.Despite the concerns, Montague kept both roles until February 2024, when he resigned from Kemble citing “personal” ­reasons. A further intra-company dividend of £158.3m was paid in March 2024. Thames Water said it ­considered all regulatory obligations in making the payments, which were used to service debt obligations, settle amounts for group relief surrendered and make pension contributions.Rules introduced in May 2023 required water companies to take account ofenvironmental performance and customer deliverywhen deciding whether to pay dividends.In a provisional decision in December 2024, Ofwat found Thames Water had broken dividend payment rules. It proposed a penalty of £18.2m for the “unjustified” payments of £37.5m and £158.3m, with a consultation on the proposal closing last month and a final decision yet to be announced.“Such an obvious conflict of ­interest between the chair of the ­operating company and the holding company should never be allowed,” James Wallace, the CEO of River Action, told theObserver. “What on earth were the previous government doing allowing that to happen?”Thames Water has paid out more than £7bn to shareholders since it was privatised in 1989. The firm said it had not paid a dividend to “external shareholders” since 2017.Ofwat said: “We were aware of the potential for a ­conflict of interest to arise through the dual roles [held by Montague], and Ofwat requested and received ­assurance from the company that these points were recognised and would be managed pro-actively.” It said its investigation into the dividend ­ payments was not yet concluded and it would be inappropriate to provide further comment.Thames Water said: “Sir Adrian resigned as chairman of Kemble Water Holding Limited and its Kemble subsidiaries on 17 February 2024, because he felt the time was right to fully focus on the work ahead at Thames Water.There is no suggestion a conflict of interest occurred. Thames Water follows the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code and Ofwat’s Board leadership, transparency and governance principles.“Our plans assume no ­external ­dividends to shareholders until at least 2030, to support our ­turnaround.“Sir Adrian, and the board of Thames Water are focused on putting the business on a firmer financial ­footing and unlocking billions of pounds for investment.”Defra said: “This government has wasted no time in cleaning up the water sector. We have … taken immediate action to ban bonuses for polluting water bosses and ­ringfence money earmarked for vital ­infrastructure, so it is never spent on bonuses or shareholder payouts.“We have also launched the largest review into the sector since privatisation 30 years ago, which will make further recommendations about how to stamp out conflicts of interest and improve financial resilience.”Explore more on these topicsThames WaterThe ObserverUtilitiesWater industrynewsShareReuse this content"

We are all grieving that a child’s life has been taken so tragically,” said Sahira Irshad of Sheffield Mums United, who supported the march.“We stand together showing support to Harvey Willgoose’s family and friends. Life is precious. Harvey’s loss shows the fragility of life. We must come together as one to tackle the issues surrounding knife crime.”Harvey Willgoose.Photograph: Twitter/XThe march was also supported by Sheffield anti-knife crime charity Always an Alternative.An organiser, Spencer Starkes, wrote in a Facebook post: “Since news broke earlier this week we’ve been working with Sheffield council, South Yorkshire police and Sheffield United to organise [a] peaceful gathering outside the town hall.“This will be a peaceful gathering and walk, it’s about one thing and one thing only: getting these [knives] took off our streets.“Please share as far you can and let’s get one hell of a turnout.”View image in fullscreenThe march was supported by Sheffield anti-knife crime charity Always an Alternative.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverAn online fundraising appeal for the funeral costs has raised more than £17,000. The appeal’s organiser, Jenna Hitchcock, said in a post on Wednesday: “Thank you all so much for helping us reach target.“I’m overwhelmed with your generosity. You can still donate, let’s smash this target! Harvey you have touched the hearts of the nation.”All Saints Catholic high school separately paid tribute to the 15-year-old, saying he was “an invaluable part of our school community”.Steve Davies, the CEO of St Clare Catholic multi-academy trust, offered the family condolences and said Harvey’s death “shakes us to the core”.View image in fullscreenTwo women console each other during the march.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverDavies added: “Harvey was an immensely popular young man with his fellow students and teachers alike, he had a smile that would light up the room. Harvey was young. He was precious. He was loved.“We are all struggling to process what has happened and our thoughts and prayers are with Harvey’s family and friends at this incredibly difficult time.”In a statement released by South Yorkshire police earlier this week, the Willgoose family said: “We are utterly heartbroken at the loss of our beautiful boy, ‘Harvey Goose’. Our lives are devastated and will never be the same again. We have lost a beloved son, brother, grandson, cousin, nephew and most importantly, a best friend to all.“Harvey will be forever known for being a caring, loving and funny young man. At this difficult time we ask you to please respect our privacy as we grieve as a family.”A 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared at Sheffield crown court on Thursday charged with murder, affray and possession of a knife and is being held in a youth detention centre.A trial date was fixed for 30 June.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

My client, Wayne, who suffered severe head injuries, and others in his position, have received little recognition or support.“While the families of those who lost their lives have quite rightly had access to government ministers, the injured survivors have not been given the same opportunities. Their experience and perspectives are essential to understanding the full impact of these events, and they must not be overlooked.”He added: “The victims – both the bereaved and the injured – must be fully involved in this process, included in discussions with government ministers and the prime minister, and given a voice in shaping the lessons that must be learned.“We urge the government to include the injured victims in all future meetings and commit to a public inquiry without further delay.”Ian Coates’ son, James, who lives inNottingham, said he had struggled to access mental health treatment from the same service responsible for discharging Calocane nine months before the attacks.“There are still individuals out there who are not doing risk assessments, who are not completing the job properly, taking shortcuts,” he said. “There’s a system that failed but they won’t pick out the individuals, the ones that have signed on the dotted line. I just can’t have any faith in the trust.”The families said they believed Calocane, who was sentenced to indefinite detention in a high-security hospital on the grounds of diminished responsibility, should face a harsher sentence. Their solicitor, Neil Hudgell, said Calocane “was not treatment resistant, he resisted treatment”.Explore more on these topicsNottinghamNottinghamshireKeir StarmerMental healthCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

It allows players to connect with other gamers around the world.The outage began in the UK at about midnight on Friday.About 71,000 gamers reported the outage to PlayStation’s website. Many users can no longer access online gaming lobbies, the PlayStation Store or their online accounts.The PSN runs a model that costs £13.49 a month, £39.99 for three months or £119.99 for 12 months for its premium subscription. Many gamers have pointed to these costs when complaining to Sony.The weekend is when certain games host special tournaments and online events. FC 25, Electronic Arts’ popular football simulator, hosts Championship matches, known colloquially as “weekend league”, on its Ultimate Team platform. Gamers spend hundreds of hours and often hundreds of pounds investing in their Ultimate Team squads.The outage also means Call of Duty fans will be unable to play during its promotional weekend and will not benefit from double XP (experience points) in Black Ops 6 and Warzone.Thousands of angry PlayStation users have expressed their frustration with the outage on social media in memes, jokes and rants.“Let’s be real; everyone deserves this month’s PS Plus for free. Paying monthly for the network to be down on a weekend is belligerent. Did someone fall asleep during their night shift? Heading into hour 5,” one X user wrote.“I work a 9 to 5 and come home just to see the PlayStation servers are down on a Friday,” another posted.“PlayStation network down, time to get to know my wife of 5 years,” joked another.Sony responded to confirm the problems with its digital service. On its support webpage, PlayStation said it was aware of the issue and that it was working to resolve it as soon as possible.The Guardian has contacted PlayStation, FC25 developer Electronic Arts, and Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard for comment.Explore more on these topicsPlayStationOnline multiplayer gamesnewsShareReuse this content"

Farmers and cider makers are now fighting for their survivalTomé Morrissy-SwanSat 8 Feb 2025 10.41 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 10.44 ESTShareThey are a symbol of the bucolic English countryside and a staple of the West Country landscape, but since the second world war,90% of traditional orchardshave disappeared.Defined as a collection of five or more fruit trees planted in permanent grassland and managed in a non-intensive way, traditional orchards have suffered from neglect, been razed for development and converted to intensive bush orchards or alternative crops.Now cider makers are calling on the government to protect what they say is one of the country’s most environmentally friendly farming systems. Traditional orchards are often wildlife havens with rare birds and insects, andallow silvopasture– where livestock grazes on a variety of plants in forests and tree-filled pastureland, eliciting multiple uses from one field. Older orchards, proponents say, are excellent carbon storers.Late last year, David Nash of Redvers Cider & Perry in Herefordshire wrote to his local MP, theGreen party’s Ellie Chowns, about the decline and asked her to highlight the issue in parliament. “Without protection, [traditional orchards] could be lost altogether,” wrote Nash.Nash, whose cider uses several varieties of pear and apple, some from 300-year-old trees, told theObserver: “The writing is on the wall unless something is done. You only have to drive along the roads around here to see the decline. You see them being felled or dying off because no one’s replacing them. There’s no commercial value.”View image in fullscreenHarvesting apples for Redvers, which has been producing cider in Herefordshire for almost a century.Photograph: Redvers CiderDavid Lindgren of cider producer Bushel+Peck, who is chair of trustees at the Gloucestershire Orchard Trust, says traditional orchards are among “the most biodiverse agricultural environments”. Lindgren saidtree preservation orders – legal orders protecting trees– did not go far enough, and called for “more support for the conservation and creation of traditional orchards, and greater preservation and protection for orchards within the planning system”.Nash’s letter, which was signed by bodies including the Gloucestershire Orchard Trust and the UK Orchard Network, suggested greater protections for cider as a designation. These included a rise in minimum juice content for cider from the current 35% – which can be from concentrate and imported – to 50%, bringing the UK in line with the US. This could help support British apple growers, Nash said. He also called for a voluntary scheme whereby cider makers would commit to sourcing a percentage of fruit from traditional British orchards, with a label similar to the Red Tractor scheme.Chowns told theObserver: “The decline of traditional orchards is a serious concern for North Herefordshire, given their importance for biodiversity, heritage and small-scale cider and perry makers. These orchards are a vital part of our landscape and rural economy, and we must do more to protect them. I am keen to explore ways to better support traditional orchards, including ensuring government schemes like the countryside stewardship scheme and sustainable farming incentive are delivering real benefits.”She added there was a “strong case” for raising the minimum juice content and promoting the use of British apples. “I will continue to look for opportunities to raise these important issues in parliament.”Britain has experienced some of the steepestdeclines in insect speciesglobally and has some of theworld’s lowest biodiversity levels. “This has undoubtedly been exacerbated by the loss of traditional orchards, and preserving this habitat can play a key role in restoring biodiversity,” said Nash. Elevating them to an “irreplaceable habitat” on a par with ancient woodlands was a “high-ambition, low-likelihood option”.Nash said that, while traditional orchards are a priority habitat under the UK biodiversity action plan, “to change the agricultural land use, the owner must conduct an environmental impact assessment – however, this does not normally apply to a commercial decision to replace a traditional orchard under two hectares with an intensive bush orchard”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They will also be the focus of theLondon Cider Salonto be held at Tate Modern in London in June. Felix said raising awareness of the environmental benefits was vital.While there is “nowhere near enough protective legislation”, Felix said the cider world must be “proactive”. He added that the continued rise in “fine cider”, which is usually made with 100% apple, was more likely to encourage preservation of orchards than legislation. “Government is rarely proactive, more reactionary. You’d only get a change in juice content if a big enough corner of the industry is willing to change it.”The17th-century diarist John Evelyndescribed cider as “the native wine of England”, and producers are now making bottles of fine cider that cost up to £38 and sell at Michelin-starred restaurants such as the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire. Fine cider producers such as Devon’s Find & Foster and Wilding in Somerset are leading the way, saving local orchards by taking their fruit and planting new ones.Find & Foster’s Polly Hilton told theObserverthat the government could create a protected designation of origin “highlighting when cider is made from 100% apples grown in traditional orchards, supported by marketing, promotion and cider tourism development. [It] would help to make traditional orchards economically sustainable, which often seems critical to their survival.”Explore more on these topicsCiderThe ObserverTrees and forestsFruitFarmingFoodFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Subject to last-minute tests, they will synchronise with the EU’s grid at 12.00 GMT on Sunday after operating on their own in the interim.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will speak at a ceremony on Sunday to mark the switch to the EU system.“We’ve reached the goal we strived for, for so long. We are now in control,” the Lithuanian energy minister, Žygimantas Vaičiūnas, told a press conference.Immediately after disconnecting, Latvian workers used a crane to reach the high-voltage wires in Vilaka, close to the Russian border, and cut them. They handed out chopped wire as keepsakes to cheering onlookers.“We will never use it again. We are moving on,” Latvia’s energy minister, Kaspars Melnis, said.Plans for the Baltics to decouple from the grid of their former Soviet imperial overlord, which have been debated for decades, gained momentum after Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.The grid was the only remaining link to Russia for the three countries, which re-emerged as independent nations in the early 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, and joined the EU and Nato in 2004.The three staunch supporters of Kyiv stopped buying power from Russia after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but have relied on the Russian grid to control frequencies and stabilise networks to avoid outages.“By ending the energy dependence of the Baltic states on Russia, we are leaving the aggressor without the option of using energy as a weapon against us,” the Estonia’s foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna, said.An army truck was seen at the Rezekne power substation near the Latvia-Russia border, and officers with guns were patrolling the vicinity and in the nearby town, indicative of Baltic worries of attempted sabotage to the switch.The Baltic Sea region is on high alert after power cable, telecom links and gas pipeline outages to Sweden or Finland. All were believed to have been caused byships dragging anchors along the seabedafter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has denied any involvement.“The system is stable, the process is happening smoothly, no one is noticing that something changed,” Melnis said.Maintaining a constant power supply requires a stable grid frequency, which can more easily be obtained over time in a large synchronised area such as Russia or continental Europe, compared with what the Baltics can do on their own, analysts say.Lithuania’s energy ministry said it has drawn up contingency plans whereby some heavy energy users, such as factories, could be temporarily disconnected from the grid in the event of power shortages to maintain essential supplies.For Russia, the decoupling means its Kaliningrad exclave, located between Lithuania, Poland and the Baltic Sea, is cut off from Russia’s main grid, leaving it to maintain its power system alone.The Baltic countries have spent nearly €1.6bn since 2018 to upgrade grids to prepare for the switch, while Russia has spent 100bn roubles ($1bn), including on the building of several gas-fired power plants in Kaliningrad.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEstoniaLithuaniaLatviaRussiaEnergyShareReuse this content"

It ordered the shutdown of 15 pieces of equipment that did not have proper authorization.Revealed: US hazardous waste is sent to Mexico – where a ‘toxic cocktail’ of pollution emergesRead moreAuthorities said they found improperly stored material – in some cases in broken and leaking bags – in the company’s yard in the open air and in direct contact with the ground. The agency has given the company 15 days to get the material into proper storage.“The first thing is that they have to prevent it from being in contact with natural soil and they must move it to a space that complies with the regulations,” said Profepa’s head, Mariana Boy, in an interview about the initial findings of the inspection carried out in January.The Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab, a Mexican investigative journalism unit, collaborated with toxicologist Martín Soto Jiménez, who conducted sampling in neighboring homes and schools and found high levels of lead, cadmium and arsenic in soil and dust samples taken within 2km from the plant – including inside some homes and schools.Boy said her agency was trying to determine whether there is contamination from the plant affecting the community.If necessary, the inspectors could return to the plant to carry out sampling, Boy said.“We are going to be very thorough in our inspections to have sufficient information and guarantee access to environmental justice in our country,” said Boy in a press release.Also in a press release, Zinc Nacional said it had been cooperating with officials from the federal agency and has also had visits from state health, labor and environmental agencies, as well as local officials from San Nicolás de los Garza, the municipality where it is located.“We have collaborated with all of them and we reiterate that we are fully willing to address any observations identified as part of this process,” said the release. “Some of these inspections have resulted in requests for action that are being addressed. As agreed after these visits, the material will be removed from operating yards and covered to minimize the environmental footprint of our activities.”‘A trash can for the US’: anger in Mexico and Canada over toxic waste shipmentsRead moreAccording to Profepa, Zinc Nacional told its inspectors that the contents of the thousands of sacks in that yard are the company’s finished product: zinc oxide.Zinc Nacional imports electric arc furnace dust, also known as steel dust, from the US. A byproduct of steel recycling, it is hazardous waste and contains high levels of lead, cadmium and arsenic. These are toxic metals that can cause health problems ranging from brain damage in children to cancer. At its Monterrey-area plant, the company recycles the steel dust to obtain zinc.Bruce Lanphear, an international expert on the health effects of lead and a professor at Simon Fraser University, said that to understand any possible dangers posed by the plant, independent testing will be needed.“Did officials test the 30,000 tons of improperly stored material? I hope so,” he said. “Did they conduct extensive sampling of soil and dust in nearby communities and measure it for heavy metals? Those steps are essential to assessing the risk to residents.”On Friday, two federal legislators called on Mexico’s Congress to press the country’s environmental regulators for a deeper investigation of Zinc Nacional, questioning whether recent actions, which included the shutdown of the 15 pieces of equipment at the plant, are enough.“They have already audited and put seals [on the plant], but the company is still operating,” said Irais Reyes of the Movimiento Ciudadano party in a video posted on X. Her party is a minority party at the federal level, but holds the governorship where the plant is located in the state of Nuevo León.In the same post, her colleague, the legislator Laura Ballesteros, questioned whether companies in the United States have a motive to send their waste to Mexico to avoid US regulation.“This company [Zinc Nacional] releases toxic substances such as lead, cadmium and arsenic into the air, putting health in Nuevo León at serious risk,” she said. “How long will they continue to operate without consequences?”Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmerica's dirty dividePollutionCancerSteel industryHealthAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Not far away, entire blocks have been reduced to rubble, but here, in this small corner of the city in the southernGazaStrip, the damage is less extensive. Raed al-Sawafiri, the owner and manager, stands in front of chicken rotating on a grill and smiles. Every one of his plastic tables is occupied.Al-Sawafiri had no experience of the restaurant trade until very recently. Displaced 10 times during the 16-month conflict in Gaza, the 23-year-old opened his first establishment in Rafah, the southernmost city in the territory, early this year, after sourcing old equipment and sending his father to the border with Egypt to buy meat.“The response from people was amazing, but we had to flee the [Israeli] attack on Rafah and move to the coast. Finally, I decided to try again in Khan Younis and, thanks be to God, we have had success,” he said.The restaurant is one of thousands of small businesses created during the war by desperate residents seeking to survive economically. Planners now hope such initiatives will help drive reconstruction efforts – if the ceasefire holds and Donald Trumprevises his planfor the US to “own” the territory, displace its population of more than 2 million and transform it from a “demolition site” into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.Al-Sawafiri risked death or injury to furnish his restaurant, scouring Gaza despite the Israeli offensive, which has reduced much of the territory to shattered ruins.“Sometimes, I had to walk long distances to fetch water, and at times, I would search in areas like Deir al-Balah and Rafah and buy the necessary equipment at any cost, and it was hard to find skilled chefs and quality spices, but I did not give up,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe al-Sawafiri restaurant in Khan Younis.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianOnly a handful of such establishments exist but their popularity is a testament to the resolve of Palestinians in Gaza, observers say, where more than 90% of homes have been damaged or destroyed, along with almost all basic infrastructure.Projections from 2024 estimate that justclearing Gaza’s rubble, which is contaminated by toxic chemicals and unexploded bombs, would take a fleet of 100 lorries 15 years.Yet many in Gaza say they are determined to rebuild, posting videoson social mediaof efforts to clear their homes of rubble, orpizza vansworking their way through the ruins.“They are heroes,” said Yara Salem, a former World Bank executive based in Ramallah who has worked with communities in Gaza on a new redevelopment plan. “It is superhuman, their ability to live and relive. We have this in our blood. We are not going to live on handouts in a refugee camp. I am a Palestinian and I have never seen such resilience like I see in Gaza.”In Khan Younis on Thursday evening, families sat down to share dinner in restaurants such as al-Sawafiri’s – some for the first time since the beginning of the conflict in October 2023.Nivin Qadeh, 38, said: “The last time we went out was three days before the war started. The whole family went out on a trip before the school year began for our children.“We used to go out often, and could give our children whatever they asked for. But now we have lost our house and all our savings, so it is very difficult. For this one evening, we can forget our troubles.”Qadeh’s family was displaced from their home east of Deir al-Balah at the start of the Israeli offensive, which has killed at least 47,000 people, mostly civilians. The war was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas into Israel that killed 1,200 people, also mostly civilians, with 250 taken hostage.Qadeh said: “There are still fears of the war returning because the ceasefire is conditional and not permanent. I am very afraid that … the war will return as before. What will happen next is unknown, but we make the most of every minute during the ceasefire to feel a little psychological stability and have life return to normal, even if just a little.”Despite the efforts of aid agencies, food in Gaza remains scarce. While some prices fell between December 2024 and January 2025, many basics are up to 12 times more expensive than before the war. And though a third of households surveyed reported improved access to food, according to the UN, many are still eating little more than bread and tinned vegetables. The most recent statistics revealmore than 1 million people are facing “emergency levels of food insecurity”or worse.Fuel is also a major problem, with no electricity and very little gas. For months, waste plastic and wood have been used for cooking, but these are scarce now, too.View image in fullscreenFahd al-Af, the owner of Fahd’s in Khan Younis.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThose with regular incomes can afford the occasional meal from a restaurant. Sihaam Abu Ghmeil, 29, who works for an international NGO, said he had come to the Fahd restaurant in Khan Younis to buy lunch for his family.“This was always one of my favourite restaurants. The last time I came was before the war, on the Thursday night just before the war began. We went out as a family, had dinner outside, and some sweets, and stayed until late at night. That was the last family outing,” Abu Ghmeil said.“I will delete all memories of the war from my mind completely. In the future, I do not want to remember anything from this time. I only want to hold on to the happy and beautiful memories of Gaza before the war, for fear that those days may not return.”Nearby, Ahmed Hamad, a 19-year-old from Beit Hanoun who was a member of a traditional dance company before the war, was enjoying a shawarma kebab.He said: “Now, we feel some relief thanks to the ceasefire, and we walk the streets feeling more at ease. We are now able to go out to enjoy shawarma or sit in cafes, which is really important because we need to find ways to release our emotions after such a long period of tension.”On the night before the war, Hamad was performing in a restaurant in the Jabaliya camp, now reduced to ruins. “The atmosphere was very nice during those days, and I can’t forget them. When I remember those moments, I feel deep sadness,” he said.He is not among those planning to rebuild Gaza, and is hoping for a life elsewhere: “I will be one of the first to leave when the crossing opens for travellers, because the situation here has become unsafe, and I prefer to go to a safer place.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

However, delays in bringing the case before a jury have allowed his lawyers to successfully argue for bail.The delays were condemned by Caruana Galizia’s family, who claimed the state and the justice system were “failing the victims”.Fenech and his family have pledged over €50m in cash and shares as security for his release.View image in fullscreenRelatives of Daphne Caruana Galizia take part in a protest march in Valletta, Malta, in 2023 on the sixth anniversary of her assassination.Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/ReutersCaruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb which was detonated as she was leaving her home in Bidnija, Malta. The case embroiled the governing party in scandal and accusations of a cover-up, while the spectacle of a violent assassination within an EU member state raised concerns over attacks on journalists withinEurope.Fenech walked out of Corradino Correctional Facility on Thursday evening, five years after he was first charged. In a navy zip-up jumper and jeans, clutching paperwork and accompanied by his defence lawyer, Fenech climbed into a van with blacked-out windows as film crews pressed towards him. He declined to comment, saying only “thank you” before the van moved away.Fenech is one of seven men who have either admitted to or been charged in connection with the killing. He denies the charges and is pleading not guilty.To date, none of the accused have been put on trial. Two brotherspleaded guilty to planting the bomband were sentenced to 40 years in prison. Their accomplice was given a reduced sentence after admitting his guilt and providing evidence for the prosecution. Two of the men accused of supplying the bomb are in custody awaiting trial.Melvin Theuma, a taxi driver who claims he acted as middleman, secured a presidential pardonin exchange for giving evidenceand is living under police protection.TheDaphne Caruana GaliziaFoundation, set up by her family, said after Fenech’s release: “The bomb blast that killed her was a warning: the justice system is failing the victims.”“While no one can be kept in prison without trial indefinitely, trials could and should be completed before bail becomes a concern. Defendants, prosecutors, and the courts should not be allowed to extend proceedings for years.”Judge Edwina Grima originally agreed to bail on Friday 24 January, but negotiations over the complex arrangements for the financial guarantees took two weeks to complete, delaying Fenech’s release.His aunt has pledged her shares in the family’s property business, Tumas Group, as collateral. The stake was reportedly valued at over €50m (£42m). Fenech has also paid an €80,000 (£67,000) deposit and is bound by a €120,000 guarantee, both of which will be forfeited should he breach his bail conditions.He is barred from going within 50 metres of the coast or airport, and from contacting witnesses in the case against him, including Theuma.He will have to sign a bail book at a police station every day and stay indoors between 5pm and 11am. He must only live at an address agreed with the court, and a police officer will be stationed outside his nominated residence 24 hours a day.Fenech’s passport and identification documents will be held by the court.The delays in bringing a trial have been criticised by Roberta Metsola, the president of the European parliament and an MEP forMalta, who wrote in a post on Facebook: “A system that forces those accused of the most heinous crimes to be allowed out of jail on bail because their trial by jury took more than half a decade to get under way, is a system that is broken. It is a system that cannot deliver justice.”The attorney general, who is leading the prosecution, argued against the release, citing flight risk and the possibility of witness interference. However, Maltese law allows defendants to leave prison if a 30-month period elapses without trial after their initial bill of indictment.Malta’s prime minister, Robert Abela, said he understood the family’s pain but rejected suggestions the government could have done more. Speaking last weekend he said the delay was due to constitutional cases and preliminary hearings brought by Fenech, and requests from the prosecution and family, such as anonymity for Caruana Galizia’s sources.“If you ask me whether the government could have done anything differently in this case, I would say it couldn’t,” Abela said.View image in fullscreenDaphne Caruana Galizia outside the Libyan embassy in Malta in 2011.Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/ReutersA newspaper columnist and magazine publisher whose political blog was widely read, Caruana Galizia was almost as well known in her home country as those she exposed in her scoops.

Rwanda denies military support for the M23.But a UN report said last year Rwanda had about 4,000 troops in the DRC and profited from smuggling out of the country vast amounts of gold and coltan – a mineral vital for phones and laptops.Rwanda has accused the DRC of sheltering the FDLR, an armed group created by ethnic Hutus who massacred Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s total chaos,” they said.The UN rights chief, Volker Türk, said: “If nothing is done, the worst may be yet to come for the people of the eastern DRC but also beyond the country’s borders.”Türk said nearly 3,000 people had been confirmed killed and 2,880 wounded since M23 entered Goma on 26 January, and final tolls were likely to be much higher. He also said his team was “currently verifying multiple allegations of rape, gang-rape and sexual slavery”.M23 has already installed its own mayor and local authorities in Goma. The group plans to infiltrate the national capital, Kinshasa, situated about 1,000 miles away.The DRC army, which has a reputation for poor training and corruption, has been forced into multiple retreats. The M23 offensive has raised fears of regional war, given that several countries are engaged in supporting DRC militarily, including South Africa, Burundi and Malawi.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricaTanzanianewsShareReuse this content"

The AAP won 22 seats. The outcome of the race in one remaining seat had yet to be declared, according to the Election Commission of India.India’s main opposition Congress party lost out on all seats for the third consecutive term.In a huge upset, the AAP founder and leader, Arvind Kejriwal, and his deputy, Manish Sisodia, lost their seats despite their party having built widespread support with its welfare policies and anti-corruption movement.Arvind Kejriwal: the Delhi chief minister jailed by Modi’s governmentRead more“We accept the mandate of the people with great humility,” Kejriwal said in a video statement while congratulating the BJP on its victory. He said he hoped that the BJP would fulfil its election promises.“We have done a lot of work in the field of health, education, and infrastructure in the last 10 years,” Kejriwal said. “We will not only play the role of a constructive opposition but will also remain among the people and continue to serve them.”Waving party flags and posters of Modi, supporters of the BJP chanted slogans and danced outside its headquarters in the capital as vote results began trickling, with most exit polls predicting the party’s win.The BJP’s Amit Shah, who is India’s powerful home minister, said his party’s victory signified that “people can’t be misled with lies every time”. He said under the leadership of Modi, the BJP would make New Delhi “the world’s No 1 capital by fulfilling all promises”.“Our victory is a sign of the people’s faith in prime minister Modi’s vision of progress,” he said.Saturday’s victory is seen as a big boost for the BJP after it failed to secure a majority on its own in last year’s national election, having to form the government with coalition partners. It gained some lost ground by winning two state elections in northern Haryana and western Maharashtra states last year.Before the election, Modi’s party slashed income taxes on the salaried middle class, one of its key voting blocs, in the federal budget.During the electioneering, both Modi and Kejriwal offered to revamp government schools and provide free health services and electricity, along with a monthly stipend of more than 2,000 rupees ($25) to poor women.Kejriwal was arrested last yearalong with two key party leaders on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. They have denied the accusations, saying they are part of a political conspiracy.The supreme court allowed the release of Kejriwal and other ministers on bail. Kejriwal later relinquished the chief minister’s post to his most senior party leader, Atishi, who won her seat on Saturday.Opposition parties widely condemned Kejriwal’s arrest, accusing Modi’s government of misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken political opponents. They pointed to several raids, arrests and corruption investigations of key opposition figures before the national election.Kejriwal formed the AAP in 2012 after tapping into public anger over corruption scandals. His pro-poor policies have focused on fixing state-run schools and providing cheap electricity, free health care and bus transport for women.In 2020, the AAP won 62 out of 70 seats in a landslide victory in the last state legislature election, leaving the BJP with eight and the Congress party with none.The BJP was voted out of power in Delhi in 1998 by the Congress party, which ran the government for 15 years.Explore more on these topicsIndiaNarendra ModiDelhinewsShareReuse this content"

Therefore, we are immediately revoking Joe Biden’s security clearances, and stopping his daily intelligence briefings.Trump hints Musk ‘Doge’ team has free rein with Pentagon next in line for cutsRead more“He set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the intelligence community (IC) to stop the 45th president of the United States (me!) from accessing details on national security, a courtesy provided to former presidents.”Former presidents traditionally receive some intelligence briefings even after they have left office.Biden ended Trump’s intelligence briefings after Trump helped spur efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election andincited the January 6 attackon the Capitol. At the time, Biden said Trump’s “erratic” behaviour should prevent him from getting the intel briefings.Asked in an interview with CBS News what he feared if Trump continued to receive the briefings, Biden said at the time he did not want to “speculate out loud” but made clear he did not want Trump to continue having access to such information.“I just think that there is no need for him to have the intelligence briefings,” Biden said. “What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?”Biden didn’t immediately comment on Friday’s move.Trump’s move is the latest in a vengeance tour of Washington that he promised during his campaign.He has previously revoked security clearances from more than four dozen former intelligence officials who signed a 2020 letter saying that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a “Russian information operation”.He’s also revoked security details assigned to protect former government officials who have criticised him, including hisown former secretary of state, Mike Pompeoand former infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci.In a related matter, Trump dismissed Colleen Shogan as the archivist of the United States, White House aide Sergio Gor posted on X Friday night.Trump had said in early January that he would replace the head of the National Archives and Records Administration. The government agency drew his anger after it informed the justice department about issues with Trump’s handling of classified documents. Shogan, the first woman in the post, wasn’t the archivist of the United States at the time the issue emerged.In 2022, federal agents searched Trump’s Florida home and seized boxes of classified records. He was indicted on dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding classified records and obstructing FBI efforts to get them back. He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. A judge dismissed the charges, ruling the special counsel who brought them was illegally appointed. The justice department gave up appeals after Trump was elected in November.In his Friday post on Biden, Trump cited the special counsel report last year into his handling of classified documents, saying, “The Hur Report revealed that Biden suffers from ‘poor memory’ and, even in his ‘prime’, could not be trusted with sensitive information.”Special counsel Robert Hur investigated Biden’s handling of classified information and found that criminal charges were not warranted but delivered a bitingly critical assessment of his handling of sensitive government records. The report described Biden’s memory as “hazy,” “fuzzy,” “faulty,” “poor” and having “significant limitations.” It said Biden could not recall defining milestones in his own life such as when his son Beau died or when he served as vice-president.With Associated Press and ReutersExplore more on these topicsJoe BidenDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

I have seen comedies so dedicated to killing every last one of your brain cells that they have become total horrors. I have seen sex scenes drained of all sex. I have seen Jim Carrey play against type as a hardboiled detective with a light Polish accent. I have seen Nicolas Cage play to type as a hardboiled action lead in a film with a ludicrous premise (more on that later). I have seen actors deliver lines such as: “You are like the most precious flower and your blooming can only be enjoyed once!” with varying degrees of success. I have witnessed this exchange in a plodding crime drama:Dad: What kind of sicko fucks their stepmom?Son [aggrieved]: I introduced you to her!Within seconds of this dialogue a knife will fly through the air and mortally wound someone in the head, setting off a violent shower of gunfire. Bodies will fall; audiences will weep. I have watched every 0% film on Rotten Tomatoes’ list of theWorst Movies of All Timeand have lived to tell the tale.View image in fullscreenTurkey crowned … Theo James and Billy Bob Thornton in London Fields.Photograph: Steffan Hill/Head Gear Films/AllstarCurrently 40 films on Rotten Tomatoes have earned two ignoble distinctions. First, they’ve received a 0% approval rating. Second, they’ve been reviewed 20 or more times, meaning they’re usually larger productions, not small indie misfires, thus granting them a position on the website’s Worst Films of All Time list (take away that second criteria, and the net widens; at the time of writing, 572 films available on streaming make the cut). I discovered this list last winter, after reading Martin Amis’s novel London Fields and learning of its ill-fated film adaptation, a curious project that began in 2001 under David Cronenberg, and after nearly two decades and many false starts – including a brief time under Michael Winterbottom – resulted in a 2018 film by Hollywood music video director Mathew Cullen that boasted a starry cast (including Billy Bob Thornton and Amber Heard) and debuted to uniformly negative reviews: “A trashy, tortured misfire from beginning to end,” ruled theNew York Times.I wondered just how bad it was. I wondered just how bad they all were. And so this winter, a routine was established. I would settle on my sofa and load up a stinker. I thought it would be fun, in the way that indulging in things that are generally bad for you is fun, but instead I found my heart growing heavier each time, my critical faculties grinding to dust. My attitude to films began to resemble the feeling one has towards food after a particularly vigorous session at an all-you-can-buffet: no more. After I watched film No 34, I was convinced I had seen a masterpiece, before realising it merely had a basic understanding of suspense. But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me take you back to the start.September 2024. The first film I watched was Cabin Fever, a 2016 remake of director-actor Eli Roth’s 2002 cult horror. Five university students venture into the country for a weekend away, only to be terrorised by a deadly flesh-eating virus. The townspeople are unlovely caricatures of unsophistication, with a habit of saying things like: “What did I tell you about biting city folk!” (admonishing a cannibalistic child) and, “Got to get me another hog!” (checking on their hogs). The film’s gender politics could be described as “spicy”: around the living room fire the first night, the two female students talk about masturbation in front of the gawping boys, and I could not tell if this was empowering or not, though it passes the Bechdel test in a very literal way.The 2016 Cabin Fever was ruled a forgettable remake that did not add anything to the original. Pointlessness was a defining feature in the next few films, which seemed like lifeless approximations of better ones in their respective genres. Hard Kill, a 2020 Bruce Willis action vehicle, sees the star as a CEO who has to save his kidnapped science genius daughter (played by Lala Kent of reality TV show Vanderpump Rules fame). There’s the usual trappings of the genre: gun battles, a showdown between rivals, and a mission to “save the world” by preventing a technology called Project 275 falling into the wrong hands, though it’s never clear what Project 275 is. Watching the film, you get a vague approximation of what it’s trying to do, but its true meaning eludes you.I found my heart growing heavier each time, my critical faculties grinding to dustDark Crimes, meanwhile, is a gritty noir with Jim Carrey as a Polish detective whose investigations bring him into the orbit of a mysterious woman played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. With stylish cinematography, it’s one of the more technically accomplished works – within the 0% club, the quality of films varies wildly – but is boring and takes itself too seriously. I was more excited to watch Homecoming, a kidnapping drama featuring Mischa Barton as an obsessive ex-girlfriend. It was not great – a far less interesting version of Misery – but I did feel invested in the plot and characters, and such things were beginning to feel rare and special.I had anticipated funny glorious failure; what I saw were things that fell into the forgettable middle. But that makes sense. After all, Rotten Tomatoes is not a reliable indication of quality. As an aggregator of reviews that have been flattened into binary judgments of “fresh” or “rotten”, it doesn’t distinguish between films that are mediocre or divisive. A film that is merely good but uncontroversial can emerge as a 90% masterpiece; a 0% film can be blandly fine, but fail to prompt any enthusiasm. Not all films on the worst-ever list have been reviewed by the Guardian, but the ones that have often fell into the blandly mediocre camp, receiving two out of five stars – a rating that amounts to “bad, but not worth a panning”. Some of the most beloved worst films of all time – Tommy Wiseau’s The Room, so silly that it still attracts rowdy audiences all over the world, to the Hitchcock-inspired misfire Birdemic: Shock and Terror – have eked out some positive reviews (Birdemic,Variety ruled, has “a goofy, almost surrealist charm”) and so don’t make the list.The famously slated Staying Alive, the Sylvester Stallone-directed sequel to Saturday Night Live with John Travolta, is featured in many bad film lists, but viewed against the otherRotten Tomatoes0%-ers – where it has also earned a place – it seemed competent, if uninspired.Another unloved sequel was Return to the Blue Lagoon, the follow-up to the 1980 film that starred a 14-year-old Brooke Shields as one half of a telegenic duo marooned on a tropical island. The original Blue Lagoon was criticised for its shallowness, sentimentalism and for sexualising minors; the sequel repeats the same formula, with a 15-year-old Milla Jovovich in Shields’ place. It features the same cerulean-blue vistas and romanticised snapshots of life in the wilderness. The only drama happens in the last 10 minutes of the film; everything else washes over you like a designer perfume TV advertisement, all glamour and gorgeousness and a total void of meaning. My hypothesis that the 0% fims were ultimately more boring than offensive was soon tested by 2003’s National Lampoon’s Gold Diggers. It is dismissive and mean-spirited about nearly everybody, from its weedy young protagonists, who marry a pair of rich older women in the hope of killing them and collecting the money; to the women themselves, ghoulish in their “old age” (fiftysomething); to the side characters who are racist caricatures. Bad comedies are the most difficult to sit through. Terrible films in other genres can become accidental comedies, but a thing that tries and fails to make you laugh tends to fill you with hate. And so it was with Adam Sandler’s The Ridiculous 6, a western satire with the lethal combination of being stupid and charmless (another Blazing Saddles-inspired 0%-er, Wagons East – the last film that featured beloved comedian John Candy – seemed full of heart in comparison).View image in fullscreen‘A critic. Scatter!’ … Taylor Lautner, Luke Wilson and Adam Sandler in The Ridiculous Six.Photograph: Netflix/AllstarDid any comedies rise above the crowd? Some, at least, seemed to soften with time. 1993’s Look Who’s Talking Now – the third instalment in the Look Who’s Talking comedies, with John Travolta and Kirstie Alley – attaches the voices of Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton to live-action dogs, a practice that seemed very dated, and so oddly charming. It was maybebecauseof this, and the fact that the film was fairly inoffensive, that made it seem generally unobjectionable. Meanwhile, reviews at the time ruled 1990’s Problem Child, a comedy about a dastardly orphan as too insipid and too mean. But 30 years later, at a time when “TikTok prankster arrested after allegedly spraying bug killer on grocery store produce” is alegitimate news headline, these seemed neither excessively stupid nor cruel but in fact rather mild.It was the horror films that I had been dreading – I am a coward – but it turns out a bad horror isn’t frightening at all. A successful horror requires careful world-building and attention to logic and suspense; fail to do that and the result is underwhelming and even funny. Kate Beckinsale’s game turn as an architect in a haunted house couldn’t save The Disappointments Room from becoming one long music video featuring creepy children. One Missed Call (2008), a remake of the cult Japanese horror, meanwhile, is undone by unintentional hilarity. In it, a ghost trapped in a mobile phone wreaks havoc on the living. “What if her spirit’s there, moving through the phones, attacking people?” one character asks to no one’s great interest, as elsewhere a lone ghostly hand bursts out of the pavement brandishing a mobile. It’s true that we would soon all become haunted by our phones – but just not like this. Not like this at all.Among the films on the list, one is known as the worst of the worst: 2002’s terribly named Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever. It’s been reviewed 118 times, the most for a film with a 0% rating, and so tops Rotten Tomatoes’ Worst Movies of All Time list, where it’s deemed a “startlingly inept film” featuring “wall-to-wall action without a hint of wit, coherence, style, or originality”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu play secret agents – Ecks and Sever – who team up against a rogue boss. (Why the film’s title pits them against each other is another mystery in a bottomless pit of mysteries.) Ballistic is a parade of explosion after explosion, shootout after shootout, with plenty of scenes of a taciturn leather-clad Liu strutting around, a beleaguered Banderas seeking revenge, all thinly tied together by a barely there plot.In general, high-concept action films were the best to watch; whatever inanity was going on could be allayed by high-paced action set-pieces, ambitious stunts and campy villains. Not every one delivered, though: take Gotti, the biopic of mafia crime boss John Gotti with John Travolta (the actor appears three times on this list). With its frenetic pacing and multiple time jumps, it’s impossible to follow. Watching it in a post-lunch haze, I rewound the first 10 minutes about 10 times before realising I wasn’t the problem, it was the film. The 2014 thriller Left Behind stepsinto the very big shoes of Con Air– Nicolas Cage, at the helm of a plane ride that goes wrong – and spectacularly fails to fill them. A Christian action film that explores the aftermath of the rapture, it is funny when it wants to be serious. When passengers from his plane disappear mid-flight – ie the blessed ascending to heaven – Cage tells his colleagues, “It was God”, with perhaps 30% conviction. Why did he agree to do it? “My brother Marc is a Christian pastor,” Cage has explained. “he said, ‘Nicky, you’ve really got to do this.’ When I saw how passionate he is, I wanted to do the film for my brother, too.”I gave myself until December to complete the list. By then, I turned to the 13 films that weren’t available on streaming, which involved ordering DVDs and rescuing an old Xbox One from the attic (five films weren’t available on UK streaming or DVDs at all). In total, I watched too many films to name here, but the theme that emerged was one of brutal downfalls. Hollywood can be a miserable business, where the highs are fleetingly high and the lows can be mercilessly low, and some of the films here proved it. Italian film-maker Roberto Benigni charmed Hollywood with his 1997 triple Oscar-winning Life Is Beautiful. His next project, a live-action version of Pinocchio, bombed in the US, where reviewers were put off by not only the premise – an adult Benigni gallivanting around as a boy puppet – but also the awful dubbing. Chinese director Chen Kaige stormed Cannes with Palme d’Or-winning Farewell My Concubine before making his first English-language production, Killing Me Softly, with Heather Graham and Joseph Fiennes, an erotic thriller that plays like questionable fanfiction. And while toy giant Mattel might like us to believe it debuted triumphantly into the world of cinema with 2023’s Barbie, its first attempt – the 2016 superhero film Max Steel – was a washout.I saved London Fields, the film that led me down this path, for the end. It felt like a poetic conclusion. It was an unusually sunny morning – it was as if the weather knew – but on screen, Martin Amis’s London looked defiantly ugly, shrouded in a gothic oversaturated fog and teetering on social collapse as Billy Bob Thornton, Theo James and Jim Sturgess’s characters vie for the attention of clairvoyant-seductress Nicola Six, played by Amber Heard. Filled with gravelly lines pulled straight from the novel such as “This is London. There are no fields, only fields of operation and observation” set to self-serious montages, the film strives to be a sexy noir and comes across more like a 2000s pop-metal music video.“It was the hardest movie I ever did,”Billy Bob Thornton saidahead of its release. “We were squeezing 10lb of shit into a 5lb bag. We didn’t have enough money or enough time […] We hope we do you proud with the film. If we let you down, I apologise in advance, but we sure gave it our best.” It’s a moving quote, all the more so considering the outcome (the director and producers fought for control over the film. As was the case with other films on this list, the director lost, and has distanced himself from the final result.) Some films soar, others fall, but all are sprawling endeavours involving great amounts of work. To have it fail, after all that, is tragically human.Ripe for a kicking: Hollywood’s love-hate relationship with Rotten TomatoesRead moreAs the credits to London Fields rolled, I wondered what I had learned from this three-month odyssey through the boring and the bad, the underwhelming and the outrageous, the generic and the questionably unique. It was difficult to compare them, but the worst of the worst, for me, was National Lampoon’s Gold Diggers. It is hard to compete with a comedy that lands no jokes and is outright offensive (the same could be said of The Ridiculous Six, though that at least that had the money to produce interesting sets). The worst action film was, for pure incomprehensibility, Hard Kill, while 2011’s Beneath the Darkness was the worst horror, as the killer (a magnificent scenery-chewing Dennis Quaid) is identified early on, with the rest of the film dedicated to the uninteresting logistics of catching him.While good art can be transcendent and awe-inducing, bad art at its best reminds us of our humility and vulnerability and the inevitability of failure. We all feel the desire to create; we all see grand ambitions fall apart. Plenty of the films in this list were corporate cash-grabs and paint-by-numbers productions that could have been generated by AI. Beyond them, it’s those moments of humanity – funny, absurd, too close to home – that will stay with me. That bizarre piece of dialogue; the performance that tries too hard; Nicolas Cage signing up to a questionable script because it would make his brother happy. It’s said that great art reveals something about the human condition. The best bad art does the same thing, too. I probably won’t revisit any of these films, and did not find a great misunderstood gem, but have been given a crash course in the ways things just go simply and gloriously wrong. There are so many.Explore more on these topicsFilmRotten TomatoesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My dad, Chip, was a musician; my mum, Carol [Dilworth], was an actor and gameshow hostess. They were glamorous. They had famous friends. Our house was always party central.Growing up withguitars propped in every corner – and a little recording studio – of the house meant that my brother, sister and I were never going to become accountants.I was quite aprecocious kid. I never had any other aspirations other than music, so I slightly rebelled at school. I wish I’d paid more attention. I left at 15 and learned my craft by playing pianos in pubs.Buddy’s Songkickstarted my career. I starred with Roger Daltrey. Acting wasn’t what I wanted to do – I went for the part because I thought there might be a record deal at the end of it, which there was. I’d been sending cassettes of my songs to record labels and been turned down. The One and Only came from the soundtrack to the film.When I performedonTop of the Popsmy life became crazy. Suddenly, everywhere I went there was a gaggle of girls and paparazzi. The One and Only got to number one all over Europe and into the Top 10 in the States. Things turned upside down.I understandwhen I see young artists have their exhaustion moment – I once went to seven countries in one day. Very instantly your life is not your own. You have success in different territories all at the same time and you have to go and visit them. My brother and I were away from home for two years.I never reallyunderstood the hysteria of fame. I’d come face to face with a fan and they’d just scream in my face. Things are different now.Once the record labelsdropped me, I went off the rails. I drank and took drugs to escape the fact I thought I was a washed up has-been at 22. I closed the lid on my feelings, which wasn’t very healthy.It was pretty instantwhen I met Krissy. She was 20, I was 22. She walked into a pub in Mortlake, London, near where I lived, to celebrate 4 July – she’s American. I asked if I could buy her a drink. She said, “I’ll have a pint of lager.” In my head I thought: “Marry me.”Our secret?Spending time away from each other. It’s true that absence makes the heart grow fonder. But there are many other secrets. Communication is crucial: we don’t hide anything from each other.My dad once said,“Don’t believe the hype – none of it’s real.” I didn’t really take that in at the time, but I do now, especially as I’m a father myself. Our kids are 23, 21 and 18 – they are what’s important in life.I have no regrets.There are things in my career I’d have done differently but they don’t keep me up at night. I believe everything brings you to where you are.I’m happy to be home.I’ve been living in the desert of LA for the past 12 years, but we’re now in leafy Surrey, near where I grew up.

Shortlisted for last year’s Orwell prize for political fiction, it follows 60 characters over 650 pages and has been praised as an “extremely readable how-we-live-now novel” (Margaret Drabble) that “captures London in all its messy, multicultural glory” (Yotam Ottolenghi) and “instantly feels like a box set waiting to happen” (theStandard).Tell us howCaledonian Roadcame about.I was writing a lot of big stories for theLondon Review of Books– working with Julian Assange [on a memoir that Assange disavowed, an experience O’Haganreported on], with another guy whoclaimed to have invented bitcoin, with people who were reinventing themselves on the net – and a lot of that reporting came together in the character of Campbell Flynn, a kind of falling man at the centre of modern London corruption. I got some insight into the British aristocracy’s relationship with dirty Russian money, and following that money led to street gangs, migrant traffickers, fashion brands and high-street businessmen. In my head, a kind of Dickens and Zola energy was pulsing. The research became huge: I was at the polo in Windsor one minute, with the queen attending, or with rap gangs or inside Leicester sweatshop factories the next. I was sort of amazed at the real-life connections and wanted to give inner life to them.Caledonian Road by Andrew O’Hagan review – the Dickens of our post-Brexit pandemic ageRead moreAre you still in touch with any of the people you spoke to during your research?A few. Some are dead, some are in jail, some have flown the country, and others are thriving in plain sight, so heavily disguised they didn’t recognise themselves. Or chose not to. You’d be surprised how skilled people become at not recognising themselves. I haven’t had a single complaint.You and Campbell have a fair bit in common…He shares the obvious things with me, which localises his experience in a way I wanted for the story, but there’s as much of me spread over the other 59 characters. Many a good narrative wants a central consciousness, a central voice, and I enjoyed mapping Campbell’s years on to my own – it felt natural – but his descent into mania is completely invented. It’s a dance, actually, of the deeply personal and the wholly foreign, and that is the kind of thing I like.On stage at last year’s Edinburgh book festival you said you’ve readStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hydemaybe 35 times over the course of your life.Robert Louis Stevenson was a kind of spirit guide with this book. I love his style, how naturally he marries his personal fixations to a vision of otherness, and the Stevenson epigraph was there from the earliest draft. Campbell is divided, shadowed by a previous self, which might be awakening a capacity for disaster in him. Personally, I’ve always felt quite relaxed about the passing of time, and about where I started, but Campbell isn’t, and my reading ofDr Jekyll and Mr Hydeover the years eventually triggered, I think, a dramatic sense of inward badness in Campbell Flynn, something that dramatically contradicts his easygoing nature.If you’re interested in writing well you never dress down; you work to find the sentences that suit the materialGiven that you’re also a reporter, how do you decide when you’re going to write fiction?I usually know the form of a story as soon as I meet it. For instance, it never occurred to me for a second that the Assange story would be a novel by me. Its power, as I saw it, would flow in a piece of personal reportage. Later, Jonathan Franzen told me it helped him write his novelPurity, which features an Assange-like figure. He asked me why I didn’t write it as a novel myself, and I told him, quite frankly, that I thought the story had more vitality as nonfiction. That will sometimes be true, sometimes not. You learn to sense it. If you’re interested in writing well you never dress down; you work to find the sentences that suit the material, and if it’s nonfiction you’ll want them to stand up in court. But the quality of the writing shouldn’t decline an inch.Name something you need in order to work.It’s changed over the years. I pretty much wrote my first book,The Missing,in bed during a harsh winter, when I was in my early 20s. I began my novelOur Fathers[1999] in a rented house in West Cork that was loaned to me by the late Jenny Diski. But nowadays I’m at a desk. I like pretty lamps and old typewriters. I’ve made two beautiful writing rooms, one in London and one in Scotland, and filled them full of things that help me work. I love paintings and photographs. Not long ago I was gifted one of Evelyn Waugh’s black desks.What have you been reading lately?Working on a family story set in the late 1970s, I’ve been revisiting things – Henry James’sThe Turn of the Screw, Seamus Heaney’sStation Island– while lingering over books that capture the radiance of childhood:The Little Prince,Charlotte’s Web,A Child’s Garden of Verses.Tell us the last book you gave as a gift.An anniversary copy of Golding’s masterpieceLord of the Flies, to my daughter Nellie.What led you to open a cafe five years ago?My friend Sam Frears and I had always dreamed of opening a great cafe. Sam is blind, and he has other complicated health issues, so we thought we’d do it close to where we both live in Primrose Hill, to make it easy for him to visit every day. It’s become a huge magnet for the community,a hub for artists, writers, youthquakers and vintage talkers, and we love it. We spend everything we make on the staff, we fill the place with magazines and books, and we’reopen all day every day. I’m biased, but I think it’s the best place to spend an evening in north London.Caledonian Roadis published in paperback on 13 February by Faber (£9.99).

Good vibes are the basis of them all: laughs, warmth, a nice rapport.First up: singer Paloma Faith has a new podcast out calledMad, Sad and Bad, each episode loosely structured around her asking a celebrity guest about, yep, when they’ve felt mad, sad and/or bad. The interviews take place in Faith’s house, on a semicircular leopard-print settee – if you want to see it,go to YouTube– and so far she’s welcomedAlan CarrandMel B. Nice and snappy at around 30 minutes, including the guest ringing the bell and Faith’s welcome, these are not in-depth interviews but you do get insights.Carr was delightful, bringing in Faith’s mum (“Oh ’ello, Pam!”) and subtly steering the conversation to give funny anecdotes while not offering too many revelations. His story combining his dog dying, a spot of food poisoning and presenting a show about Agatha Christie while in full Poirot costume was hilarious. Mel B last week was more chaotic, though her discussion of her 10-year abusive marriage was touching and true. “The dripping tap of abuse,” she said, “it’s in your psyche.”The story is awful and gripping, and the podcast has the courage to name the stalker. Well done, the BBCFaith’s ditsy honesty is endearing – “I’m not listening, I only want to talk about myself,” she announced at one point – and if she could rein in her tendency to rattle away, this show would be even better.A very different concept isFin vs History, in which comedians Fin Taylor and Horatio Gould pick a few historical highlights (the Cuban missile crisis; the English civil war) and go for the dark laughs. Taylor’s hugely successfulFinvs the Internetonline show, where he drops filthy ridiculousness on internet celebrities, is along the same lines. If you’re not familiar, then consider this a trigger warning.View image in fullscreen‘Dark laughs’: Fin vs History presenters Fin Taylor and Horatio Gould.Photograph: Jack MargerisonStill, if you can deal with them assessing Chairman Mao as the GOAT (greatest of all time) of despotic dictators – “numbers-wise he blows everyone out of the water” – then strap yourself in and enjoy. Their outrageousness is properly side-splitting, and the first few episodes of this podcast have hit the top of the comedy charts.View image in fullscreenMore jolliness inWelcome to Hell, now on its third series. This is another chit-chat between two funny men, Daniel Foxx and Dane Buckley, who have an established online following. On TikTok, Foxx plays a devil and Buckley an angel. InWelcome to Hellthey’re out of character but still quite similar. Listeners (“mostly women and bottoms”, says Foxx in the first of the new series) send in their questions and confessions, to be judged in funny, campy manner. The first question of the new series is an absolute cracker and no, I’m not revealing it.Somewhere in betweenWelcome to HellandFin vs HistoryisThe Screen Rot Podcast, in which comedian Jacob Hawley and his pal Jake Farrell chat about their current online obsessions. Last week they discussedBryan Johnson, that idiot whose quest to live for ever has led him to compare his own erection with that of his son. Even before they got to him, their pre-topic chat, encompassing David Lynch’s pop career and retiring to Spain, was brilliantly funny. The bad-taste punchline to Hawley’s concept restaurant made me snort out loud.AndThe Way They Were, with comedians Grainne Maguire and Chantal Feduchin-Pate, is also a hoot. Currently on a break but with many episodes to browse, in this show a new guest comes on to discuss a celebrity couple who have broken up (full disclosure: I’ve been on – I chose Will and Jada Pinkett Smith). Maguire researches and tells the broken-love story, Feduchin-Pate comments with snarky astuteness, and this is another laugh-out-loud podcast. Great stuff.TheObserver’s Carole Cadwalladr is co-hosting a new investigative series for BBC Sounds with her (sort of) former stepdaughter Hannah Mossman Moore.Stalkedis about Mossman Moore’s very weird experiences in her mid-20s, just a few years ago. The story is awful and gripping, and the podcast has the courage to name the person who causes Mossman Moore such difficulty, which must have been a legal minefield. (Well done, the BBC.)Just out of university, a charming older man-about-town called Kim becomes Mossman Moore’s friend. He’s supportive and fun, with access to fashion shows and posh parties; but at a certain point, when she’s in a vulnerable position, he turns scary. She cuts him off, only to find herself in a whirlwind of never-ending emails and can-this-be-real cyber-stalking that includes a bewilderingly comprehensive hacking of her online identity and that of her family. I’ve only heard two episodes but am agog to hear more. As with all stalking shows, it does make you wonder, what is wrong with some people? Why can’t they let others live their lives?View image in fullscreenFor a palette cleanser after such nastiness, you might tryOur Plant Stories, hosted by Sally Flatman, which began its third series last week. It can be a little slow, and my desire for a sharper edit might be because I don’t have a garden and am thus far from understanding the less-accelerated joys of horticultural life. But the tale of how New York was given a million daffodil bulbs and where those bulbs went is a sweet and interesting one, and, as with all the above shows above, it’s the vibes I enjoy.Explore more on these topicsRadioMiranda Sawyer on podcasts and radioPodcastsTrue crime (Podcasts)BBCPaloma FaithCybercrimereviewsShareReuse this content"

Bacchanalia, bust-ups, romance and raging parties, apparentlyCharlotte EdwardesSat 8 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 12.56 ESTShareImagine a hospital room: in the bed is a cheerful man, white hair in a Tintin quiff. His eyes are Swedish blue, his lashes a fine blond fan. He has a nebuliser strapped to his face, he’s taking deep breaths so that the steroid can loosen the bronchitis that has seized his chest. Outside is the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai and beyond, hills of tropical rainforest. But our patient is focused inward, mind ablaze. He is watching scenes unfold – a hotel, flame-lit, characters in frenzied dialogue. There are monks, mafia. Somewhere, echoing gunshots, causing his limbs to twitch. Over the next two nights the entire season ofThe White Lotus3 rolls before him, “as a fever dream”. The patient is Mike White, creator, writer and director of the HBO blockbuster. “By morning, I’m like, I just came up with the storyline! It was wild. I felt like I’d done crack.”White – wiry, smiley, with a voice that vibrates emotion – immediately got on to his producer, David Bernad. Bernad has worked with White for nearly 20 years and is a solid, unflustered man, the perfect foil for White’s creative mania. As White relayed how he’d hallucinated the new season’s plot, and the stories had come cosmically through the magic of Thai spirits, Bernad thought “interesting” and turned his mind to casting, locations and crew. “Mike is a very singular film-maker,” he says.For those unfamiliar, The White Lotus is a prickly satire, set in a luxury resort, with a superb ensemble cast – most memorably Jennifer Coolidge as Tanya, a pampered alcoholic, forever on the brink. Commissioned as a one-off in lockdown, the surprise hit pulled in 10 million viewers per episode, eclipsing Succession and winning a sweep of Emmys and Golden Globes. There’s a framing device: each season opens with a body, then rewinds so the action can slow-boil over seven days, but the content, as White puts it, “shape shifts”. The first season, set in Hawaii, focused on wealth privilege (who can forget Olivia and Paula with their Freud andFanon, and looks like well-aimed grenades). The second, in Sicily, was a bedroom farce (with a sensational side order of “high-end gays”).This time, White, 54, draws on his obsession with spirituality, west versus east, “kind of a heaven and hell”, Bernad says. The first seasons cost an estimated $3m an episode, but three is a monster: eight episodes and a sprawling cast including Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the “I’m-done-with-rich-white-people” spa manager from season one. The new hotel guests are three midlife blondes (Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Leslie Bibb), an upstanding southern family (Jason Isaacs, Parker Posey, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Sarah Catherine Hook and Sam Nivola) and a raddled misery guts with his young, Mancunian “let’s get fucked up” girlfriend (Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood). Probably most famous in the lineup is Lisa of K-pop bandBlackpink(real name Lalisa Manobal), making her acting debut in the Thai cast, alongside London-born Tayme Thapthimthong, who trained with the military before moving to Thailand as a singer and bodyguard.View image in fullscreenSarah Catherine Hook on set …View image in fullscreen… and with White Lotus family members (from left) Jason Isaacs, Parker Posey, Patrick Schwarzenegger and Sam Nivola. Photographs: Fabio Lovino and HBOTo say the show is hotly anticipated is to understate the frenzy around the franchise. Where else could you see a story about families on holiday so perfectly crescendo into a ketamine-fuelled gay orgy? When the latest trailer dropped, however, fans had questions. Why does it look like an action thriller? Where is the subtlety, the knowingness, the gleeful digs at the very class in whose point of view the show is framed?Mostly, though, they are still in mourning for Jennifer Coolidge, whose character was killed off in the season two finale. Mike White, too. “I miss her a lot,” he says. “Not just as an actress, but as a person on the set. She was such an emotional part of the show.” So Mike White bottled lightning twice. The question is: can he do it again?All of which brings me to Thailand, midway through filming. This season’s White Lotus is the Four Seasons in Koh Samui, but it’s the first day of shooting at the Rosewood in Phuket, where the restaurant scenes take place. It’s hot – so hot that on a boat the previous day, one crew member’s Crocs melted into the floor.In the press tent, a handful of writers are watching a monitor while we wait for the cast to be brought over. Bernad raises his voice over thecicadasso he can explain to us the scene being shot. Isaacs, Posey and Hook, of the family from North Carolina, are having dinner. Their two sons (played by Schwarzenegger and Nivola) are elsewhere “on an adventure”. There’s a conversation about Buddhism –“boo-dism” in Posey’s character’s southern drawl – but it’s clear from Isaacs’s face that something is very awry. Across the table Posey, in an off-­the-shoulder orange blouse, seems oblivious, consulting a menu and ordering wine. Her husband, she says, wants something not too spicy. “It’s his I-B-S.”Then Posey stumbles in her pronunciation of a Thai dish and there’s a shout: “Cut!” Posey fans herself furiously. “I am burning up,” she says, looking around. An ice pack is passed. She puts it in her armpit and asks someone to scratch her back. We watch White scuttle over to the table. “Awesome!” he’s saying; they’re all doing great. As he’s returning to his directing area, he pauses, turns. “What do you think?” he says, one finger raised to his lips. “Is there a world where maybe … ?” We can’t hear his next instruction, but he’s animated, his expressions elastic. In the tent, Bernad is saying Posey’s character thinks she’s better than everyone else.We watch the scene go again, and then what feels like 23 times, White sometimes squawking with laughter from behind his monitor. “Mike will not move on until he’s happy,” Rothwell explains when she visits to chat about the show. “That’s what I find myself saying to each of the actors. Because everyone wants to show up and do the job and not fail Mike. And I’m like, ‘Listen: he will not move on until he’s happy. You can take that to the bank.’ And you see everyone’s shoulders go down, like, OK.”The actors have signed NDAs, so instead of plot, we hear about life on set, the outbreaks ofdengueand food poisoning. There are monitor lizards as big as crocodiles in one hotel; snakes, monkeys, tarantulas. There are frogs the size of your thumb, which interrupt takes with a sound “likePavarotti”. Many seem relieved with a change of scene in Phuket – they’ve been months in Koh Samui, which can get “claustrophobic.”View image in fullscreenFellow cast members Walton Goggins, Aimee Lou Wood …View image in fullscreen… Dom Hetrakul and Natasha Rothwell. Photographs: Fabio Lovino/HBOIndeed, for the entire seven-month duration of filming, actors do not live in rented accommodation, as they might on other films. They live on set. That’s right, they live in the White Lotus hotel, with one other, cut off from their worlds, in the searing heat. Isaacs says, “It’s a kind of crucible, a five-star gilded cage. There’s no question that sometimes it is absolutely fabulous, and sometimes it’s Lord of the Flies.”Although The White Lotus is filmed in relative luxury, with housekeepers and personal butlers and an open bar, actors are expected to pick up incidentals. Goggins toldStephen Colberthe was shocked to discover a bottle of prosecco cost $150. “Six weeks into filming, I go to pay my bill. You’re telling me Thai-spiced cashews cost that much? I thought I had maybe, like, five. And they said, ‘No, you had 30.’”Bernad calls it an “adult summer camp” and says he’s never been on a set like it: “Everyone there is just part of the production, but there’s kids and spouses running around, too.” Arnas Fedaravičius, who plays the hot Russian yogi assigned to the three midlife women, says there’s “a weird, disconnected feeling. I’m here for work but it’s a very vacation atmosphere.”Some days, the heat makes work difficult. They can’t use air conditioning because of the noise while shooting. On film, they have to look as if they’re having a good time on holiday, when in truth they can barely function.View image in fullscreenShooting poolside.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOBut it’s not all work. There’s swimming, boats, boxing school. They can learn Thai – or Italian, Bernad says, as many crew came with them from Sicily. “Some people’s project is their body,” Isaacs says, “building a 10-pack or losing half their weight. Others work on spiritual things; meditating, looking deep inside. I’m a tennis player, so rather shallowly I spend whenever I can on a court.” And in the evening? “People are away from home and, you know, there’s a lot of bacchanalian behaviour going on. I’m not telling stories out of school. It’s just grownups doing whatever we like. Thailand is a place full of parties, and we are not immune.”Of things most often said about Mike White, the first must be that he’s “obsessed” with reality TV. “He’s very inspired by it,” Bernad says. So much so that he’s been a contestant on Survivor – and not a wafty celebrity version, but the hard-nosed real show. He proved a wily tactician and won second place. Parallels with The White Lotus are not hard to see: the conceit is premised on characters thrown together in a closed-off world with the heat turned to boil.The second is that he runs an unusual set. So, unlike most big-budget US TV shows, there is no writers’ room, just White. Every sparking word comes from his own brain. Also: all cast, no matter how famous, must audition. Isaacs, who played Draco Malfoy’s dad in Harry Potter (and whom Bernad suggested to White, having watched Death of Stalin on a plane), was surprised. “I went, ‘Tape? With Mike?’ And they go, ‘No, with a casting director.’ ‘Really? OK.’ I don’t want to get too big for my boots, but I walked through Times Square and my face was on like five different billboards.’” But Isaacs did it, as he’d done aged 25, straight out of drama school, and admits, “I was incredibly nervous.”The third thing said about Mike White? To a man, they call him a genius.At sundown, White comes to the press tent and sits on a plastic stool. He says Thailand was a good canvas to get into the “conflict” people have when they seek “some kind of spiritual experience but get caught up in baser impulses”. This is especially true of Bangkok, he says: “An everything-goes kind of city.”He wasn’t sure until his hospital bed epiphany what the show would be about, but he knew Buddhism would feature. He had a “little Buddhist self-help phase” in 2004, after he suffered a breakdown while making a show for Fox – coincidentally called Cracking Up. “I got really into the concepts,” he says, forehead shining in the heat. “So I just thought maybe that would be something that was rich. But I didn’t know what the characters were, how to organise the ideas. I was just sort of hoping I would find inspiration.”For the first season, HBO approached White because they knew he was a fast writer. “It was, like, gun to my head, ‘Come up with something’ and I was so bored during the pandemic, I thought, ‘I’ll do anything.’ I don’t usually do this, but I just started writing … I was like, ‘I have three weeks to write these scripts.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He thinks about this for a second. “There are some elements that are very personal, and there are some parts that I’m just like, ‘Wow, who wrote this?’ So, yeah, who knows where shit comes from.”While his work is not autobiographical, he certainly draws on experience. After his breakdown, he wrote and directedEnlightened, starring Laura Dern, about a sales executive who unravels after an affair and has an epiphany while swimming with turtles in Hawaii.When White was 11, his father, a minister at the Covenant church, in Pasadena, California, came out to the family but stayed closeted to the outside world for another decade. “I guess it made me very skeptical about how people present themselves,” he told the New York Times. “What’s really the truth. But in a way, it was also really liberating, especially for me to be given the idea that there is no way to live this normative lifestyle.” He went to an east coast university, but returned to LA and secured a job as a writer on Dawson’s Creek. He appeared on the reality TV show Amazing Race twice (with his dad). He wrote The Good Girl, starring Jennifer Aniston, and School of Rock for his friend Jack Black. Later, on the advice ofShirley MacLaine, he consulted a past-life regression guide and afterwards commissioned portraits of his 14 past lives. One was a medieval soldier who died in battle, another a Maori tribesman. Another still was a Gatsby-era alcoholic whose boat sank, and there was a Cuban waitress who he said “slept with all my friends’ boyfriends and I got an STD and no one would help me and I died in a flophouse”.View image in fullscreenBeach buddies (from left) Morgana O’Reilly, Arnas Fedaravičius, Christian Friedel, Dom Hetrakul and Lalisa Manobal.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOWhite has said he identified with Armond (Murray Bartlett), the put-upon hotel manager in the first season of The White Lotus, and with Quentin (Tom Hollander), the English expat queen in season two. He also relates to Quinn Mossbacher, the 16-year-old boy who jettisons a life of screens and privilege to run away with a Hawaiian canoe crew (“Maybe it’s my Survivor experiences”).But in his life, White has also been – like all of us, he believes – the terrible man-brat Shane Patton (Jack Lacy), who even on honeymoon is obsessing that he’s been given an inferior room. That people can see themselves in all his characters is part of the show’s success. And while he doesn’t retread storylines, he often returns to the symptoms of our modern malaise – screen addiction, porn, prescription meds, identity narcissism: humans in crisis, the crisis it is to be human.Asked what else makes the show loved, White shrugs. “Honestly, I have no idea. I’ve done so many other things where I’m like, ‘This is cool’ and nobody watches. I feel like a surfer. I’ve been in the water a long time and I caught a wave. I am still riding that wave. So it’s nice.”White doesn’t shy away from the seamier side of Thai tourism. Some of this season’s action unfolds on a superyacht whose crew were thrilled to be rented by the White Lotus team, “because they were so used to Russians with prostitutes and guns”. Isaacs says, “To be honest, what I saw with the older European men and the young Thai girls is disgusting and turns your stomach. The scale of the prostitution and that people are sold into it is horrendous.” White says he noticed all the Russians as he travelled around Thailand, so wrote them in: “Hopefully they don’t feel like stock parts.”View image in fullscreenParker Posey, Sam Nivola, Sarah Catherine Hook and Jason Isaacs on set.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOIsaacs says White never stops thinking about the show. Even on set he’s writing all the time. “He’ll text at odd hours, always wanting to work on it, always wanting to make it better.” White says he wants actors to feel they can approach him with their thoughts, that there are no hierarchies on set: “I don’t want to be somebody who’s niggly about every word.” He wants the characters to feel “lived in” by the actors, “natural”. But adds, “Every once in a while, I’ll think, no, I want them to say it how I wrote it. Some words are important.”All this freedom is because he doesn’t like sets that are “uptight”. “I try to make it fun as best as I can. But if you want to get something, you want to have an intentional approach. So it’s figuring out when to be mellow and when to care.”White apparently sees no contradiction in being “mellow” and also one of the most competitive people anyone has ever met. He’s training as if for a triathlon, arriving in the gym at 4.30am and where possible going to bed at 8pm. On set he has instigated a Whoop competition – as in the wristband that monitors sleep and exertion – encouraging those in the Whoop group to compare daily stats. Not just Bernad, whose Whoop registered an extreme workout, so terrified was he on the speedboat yesterday, but the young, muscle-bound actors such as Schwarzenegger.“Mike is always asking me how many grams of protein I’ve had today,” Schwarzenegger, 31, says when he pops by the tent in an I Heart LA cap. “And what’s my heart rate variability, and how many hours of sleep did I get. He’s like the only other person who, if I have a 6am call time and I go to the gym at 4.45 or 5, he’s already there.” Fedaravičius, 33, is also in the gym. In addition to practising muay thai and yoga, “I lift a lot of weights,” he says. Also, “I eat only once a day.” Usually that’s breakfast at 7am, because the hotel puts on such a good spread, but sometimes a steak or three burgers at supper. He says White’s most useful note has been “just relax”: “What Mike is asking is for us to bring in more of ourselves; uniquely ourselves. Which as an artist and an actor is a one-of-a-kind experience.”View image in fullscreenWhite Lotus newbies Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan, Leslie Bibb …View image in fullscreen… and Patravadi Mejudhon. Photographs: Fabio Lovino/HBOMost of the actors here agree that if White gives you a note, you’d be a damn fool not to take it. That’s not to say everyone does. There’s a huge clash of acting styles on set. Some are method actors, staying in character between takes and even for days between scenes. Others shake it off when the director says cut. When Isaacs, who is British, comes out of his scene with Posey, he’s asked how they differ. “She has a completely different attitude to how to be on a set and how to bring a script to life. She’s a very idiosyncratic individual. And we’re from very different schools of acting.”In Sicily, reports that Aubrey Plaza (Harper) and Michael Imperioli (Dominic) disagreed on improvisation were batted away. Plaza joked Imperioli has “intense method energy” but said they had a collaborative relationship on set. It was also suggested that in Hawaii, the onscreen friction between Bartlett and Lacy spilled on to set, something both actors denied.After season three has wrapped, I ask Bernad, back in Los Angeles, to reflect on this aspect of the show. He says, “Whether it’s subconscious or conscious, people take on the persona of their character. Like any workplace, if you spend that much time together, people start to get annoyed with one other. The heat starts to get turned up, on and off set, just naturally [because of the storylines]. That’s another aspect of the show that’s unique. On normal productions, you work, then you go home to your family. Here you work, and you go home to the same people.” Who’s in charge of HR, so to speak? “I mean me, unfortunately, yeah. It’s usually stupid things, little grievances that I have to manage.”Carrie Coon told one magazine of her six months in Thailand, “It’s something I’ll be processing for a long time.” Isaacs says, “It was a theatre camp, but to some extent an open prison camp: you couldn’t avoid one other. There are tensions and difficulties, I don’t know if they spilled from on screen to off-screen, or if it would have happened anyway. There were alliances that formed and broke, romances that formed and broke, friendships that formed and broke. It’s a long period of time for people to be away from their family with an open bar and all the wildness being in Thailand allows.“I can’t pretend I wasn’t involved in some off-screen drama. Dave has seen it before, twice, and so has Mike. I can’t speak for them, but I imagine they think it feeds into the on-screen drama, and they might well be right. I think the heat contributed to these fissures appearing. We’ll all see one other again [for the premiere] and I’m sure we’ll be hugging and kissing and remembering it fondly. But there were times when things were not quite so fond. I was in some ways used to it, but within a couple of weeks my wife [who was with him on set and used to be an actor] went, ‘Some of these people are fucking mad.’ I said, ‘No, it’s just a bunch of actors away on location, love. You’ve forgotten what it’s like.’”Still, Isaacs says he would follow Mike White off a cliff. Bernad, too. “I’ll go anywhere for Mike. I feel like everyone who works for him feels the same way.”Maybe it could be somewhere not so hot? Bernad shakes his head. “Mike doesn’t like the cold.”The White Lotus season three is on HBO from 16 February.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusTelevisionDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was 85. Roberts’ death was announced to the New York Times by his daughter, Nicole Burley.Roberts had a genial stage personality perfect for musical comedy and he originated roles in such diverseBroadwaymusicals as How Now, Dow Jones (1967); Sugar (1972), an adaptation of the movie Some Like It Hot; and Victor/Victoria (1995), in which he co-starred with Julie Andrews when she returned to Broadway in the stage version of her popular film. He also appeared in campy roller-disco Xanadu in 2007 and The Royal Family in 2009.“I’ve never been particularly lucky at card games. I’ve never hit a jackpot. But I have been extremely lucky in life,” he wrote in his memoir, Do You Know Me? “Unlike many of my pals, who didn’t know what they wanted to become when they grew up, I knew I wanted to be an actor before I got to high school.”Roberts appeared on Broadway in Woody Allen’s 1966 comedy Don’t Drink the Water, repeating his role in the film version, and in Allen‘s Play It Again, Sam (1969), for which he also appeared in the movie. Other Allen films in which Roberts appeared wereAnnie Hall(1977), Stardust Memories (1980), A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy (1982), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and Radio Days (1987).View image in fullscreenTony Roberts, left, with Diane Keaton and Woody Allen in Annie Hall.Photograph: Rollins-Joffe/United Artists/Kobal/ShutterstockRoberts first met Allen backstage when he was starring in Barefoot in the Park, having replaced Robert Redford. Roberts had unsuccessfully auditioned four times for Allen’s first Broadway play, Don’t Drink the Water. Seeing Roberts perform in Barefoot in the Park convinced Allen that Roberts was worth casting. According to his memoir, Allen told him, “You were great. How come you’re such a lousy auditioner?”“Roberts’ confident onscreen presence – not to mention his tall frame, broad shoulders and brown curly mane – was the perfect foil for Allen’s various neurotic characters, making them more funny and enjoyable to watch,” the Jewish Daily Forward wrote in 2016.In Eric Lax’s book Woody Allen: A Biography, Roberts recalled a complicated scene in A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy that Allen shot over and over – even after the film had been edited – to get his intended effect. “When you go back to see [Allen‘s work] two, three, four times, you begin to see the amazing amount of art in it, that nothing is accidental,” Roberts said.Among his other movies were Serpico (1973) and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974). He was nominated twice for a Tony Award — for How Now, Dow Jones and Play It Again, Sam, when he was billed as Anthony Roberts.View image in fullscreenRoberts, left, with Dianne Wiest in Radio DaysPhotograph: Snap/ShutterstockOne of Roberts’ biggest Broadway successes was Charles Busch’s hit comedy The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife (2000), in which he played the title character’s husband.Roberts made his Broadway debut in 1962 in the short-lived Something About a Soldier, and was a replacement in some of its longest-running hits including Barefoot in the Park, Promises, Promises, They’re Playing Our Song, Jerome Robbins’ Broadway, The Sisters Rosensweig and the 1998 RoundaboutTheatreCompany revival of Cabaret.“I was lucky enough to get in on the last years of the Golden Age of Broadway. In that era there was a lot more going on that seemed to have high quality about it and great conviction,” he told Broadway World in 2015.In London, he starred with Betty Buckley in the West End production of Promises, Promises, playing the Jack Lemmon role in this stage version of The Apartment.Roberts’ television credits include the short-lived series The Four Seasons (1984) and The Lucie Arnaz Show (1985) as well as guest spots on such well-known shows as Murder, She Wrote and Law & Order.Roberts was born in New York on 22 October 1939, the son of radio and television announcer Ken Roberts. “I was raised in the middle of a lot of actor talk,” he told the AP in 1985. “My cousin was Everett Sloane, who was a very fine actor. My father’s friends were mostly actors. I’m sure that in some way I needed to prove myself in their eyes.”He attended the High School of Music and Art in New York and graduated from Northwestern University in Illinois. His marriage to Jennifer Lyons ended in divorce. He is survived by his daughter, actor Nicole Burley.Explore more on these topicsFilmWoody AllenBroadwayAnnie HallTelevisionTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

After all, just how different can a tin of beans be? To my surprise, I discovered very striking disparities between the ones I tested, so if you’re someone who routinely decants excess juice or reduces the sauce to achieve that authentic school dinner effect, you might be better off simply switching allegiance. Similarly, the sugar content varied between 9% of your recommended daily allowance to 13%, so if that’s a concern, look out for reduced- or no-sugar brands instead.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

If you’re after a gourmet experience, I’d recommend theBold Bean Co’s rich tomato baked beans(£3.50), because they remind me of those homemade beans you sometimes get with a fry-up at fancy cafes: intensely savoury and packed full of herbs. They don’t qualify here, because they are to ordinary baked beans what rye sourdough is to white sliced, but they’re bloody lovely all the same. That said, you can’t go wrong with any of our best buys served on buttered toast with a light dusting of grated cheddar. Small pleasures don’t come much cheaper.Best all-rounderM&S baked beans in a rich tomato sauceView image in fullscreen50p for 400g at Ocado★★★★★These have a very appetising, rich colour and, like all the best baked beans, a dash of vinegar to balance out the sweetness. There’s lots of sauce (the tin holds only 49% beans), but when said sauce tastes this good, who cares? (Note that, though these are the only ones I try that aren’t thickened with modified maize starch, they do contain various extracts and flavourings. Organic varieties are a better bet if you’re trying to avoid ultra-processed ingredients.)Best bargainMorrisons baked beans in tomato sauceView image in fullscreen45p for 410g at Morrisons50p for 410g at Amazon★★★★☆Large beans in a thick, tangy sauce with a well-rounded, almost savoury flavour – this has more seasoning than most of its rivals, and you can taste it.

Twice the price of the own-brands, but worth every penny, especially in comparison with its better known and more expensive rival.

That sauce, however, doesn’t live up to the premium price tag – it’s thin and sweet. I think Heinz is riding off its reputation at this point.Bramwells baked beans in a rich tomato sauceView image in fullscreen41p for 410g at Aldi★★★☆☆Winner of ablind tasting last year by consumer group Which?, these have a thick, almost gloopy sauce but a nice colour and a decent, if unexciting flavour, which is perhaps what people want from their morning beans. Again, I can’t pick up the spices or onion listed in the ingredients.

Nothing offensive here, just a wee bit underwhelming.Tesco baked beans in tomato sauceView image in fullscreen43p for 420g at Tesco★☆☆☆☆Unusually soft, mushy beans in a sauce that, given the relatively high sugar and salt content, is oddly bland, and thickened with maltodextrin as well as the usual modified maize starch. Just dull.Ocado baked beans in tomato sauceView image in fullscreen43p for 420g at Ocado★☆☆☆☆There are lots of small, broken beans in here, suggesting they’ve been overcooked, and they come floating disconsolately in a pallid, thin sauce. Really disappointing. (On the plus side, these have the lowest sugar content of all the beans I try, so if you’re looking for haricot beans on a budget, just give these a rinse: they’re a lot cheaper than the plain kind.)Explore more on these topicsBeans, pulses and legumesThe FilterVegetablesBritish food and drinkFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hush’s Tilly merino wool midi in grey has a tie detail to give it a shaped silhouette (4, below), while Reiss’s ivory and black contrasting hem and side stripes creates the illusion of a layered design (1).Elevate the look with kitten heel boots or metallic Mary Janes. Playful prints, such as leopard, lend themselves to drinks after work. Next’s mini style (£37) looks great with flat pumps, and Zara’s navy mini style with gold button detail has a vintage look. Simple charm bracelets, layered gold chains and wide belts add great styling touches, or add statement earrings for a less-ismore touch of glamour. Look out for design details, a cable knit or intarsia pattern, or Fair Isle motif worn with chunky kneehigh flat boots, or a sleeveless knitted dress layered over a heat-tech rollneck on chilly days, or a T-shirt in a contrasting colour can lift your look.For a more casual look try Next’s bold striped dress (3), reminiscent of a rugby jersey, add a white shirt underneath with a pair of Nike Air Force 1s for a fresh preppy look.

Six older fathers share the unexpected joys and pitfallsRichard GodwinSat 8 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTShareThe first time Gary Jenkins became a father, in 1995, his priorities changed in an instant. “I was a sales director, on the crest of a wave,” he says. “Becoming a father seemed to complement the full set: the car, the house, the job, the good life.” Holding his new daughter, however, he realised that he had never truly loved anything until that moment. “Suddenly, here I was, plunged into something beyond words, beyond my comprehension.”When, 21 years later, his second child, a son, was born, everything about that first experience came back to him: the sleepless nights, the nappy technique, the feeling that he had a new vantage point on “the circle of life”. But this time around, fatherhood felt more “visceral”, as he puts it. “The poignancy is much more real. I’m aware that I’m at the end of that loop as another life is coming into it. My time with my son feels much more limited and hence much more precious.”The principal difference is that the first time he was in his mid-30s and living in Surrey with his first wife, and now he is 66 and living in the Czech Republic with his second wife – and three extra decades of life lessons to draw on. Speaking to me on a video call, Gary looks fit and active, relishing his second chance at fatherhood. He has just spent the morning making an electronics kit with his son, Ben, who is eight. Ben doesn’t know anything about his father’s other family and Gary has no contact with them. After a divorce, he says he lost contact with his daughter. “I’d never experienced anything like it. Suddenly, all of the things that had defined me weren’t there any more. I spun out.”I don’t know if I appreciated the miracle of it as much the first time around. We all complain about how little sleep we get, but I’d forgotten what a joy it isUltimately, what this meant was that when he met “the right partner”, many years later, he didn’t hesitate to create the family life he had always wanted. “It was primal. It was a pretty easy thing to do. I asked her if she’d like to have a child. She said yes. And that was that.” There was the matter of his age. But then he read about Mick Jagger fathering another child at 73, and figured he’d be able to cope.“I was worried about energy levels. I don’t worry about that now,” he says. “I’m more concerned about the limited time I have to impart my love and my lessons for life to my son.”You may have noticed many older fathers in the public eye, such as Jeff Goldblum, 71, father to Charlie, nine, and River, seven. “I don’t know what’s true across the board, but if you make it this far, I guess you have a perspective that is soul-enhancing,” he said when I interviewed him last year. He’s a spring chicken compared with Robert De Niro, 81, and Al Pacino, 84, who are both parents to toddlers. Rupert Murdoch was 72 when his youngest child, Chloe, 21, was born. Even Donald Trump, 78, is the father of a teenager, Barron, 18, whose insights were apparently crucial in winning the male Gen Z vote.It’s generally assumed that we live in a monogamous society. Actually, polygamy is common among western elites. The men just do it sequentially, fathering children by many different partners throughout their lives. Mick Jagger has eight children born between 1970 and 2016 to five women. Nor is advanced fatherhood a modern phenomenon. A few years ago, I met the late art historian John Richardson, then in his 90s. He proudly told me that his grandfather had been born in 1812 – a two-century leap that it took me a while to realise was the result of two successive septuagenarian fathers.We can only guess at how adept Pacino is with the wet wipes. (“I want to be around for this child,” he recently told an interviewer. “And I hope I am.”) But when I spoke to a range of older fathers, they said that the business of fathering has become more hands-on in recent decades – and generally more rewarding, too.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve noticed that parental stress is dictated by whether you can afford additional assistance or not,’ says Christopher Ennis. ‘Thankfully, we can.’Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianChristopher Ennis, 70, from Kent, says he is much more engaged with Séamus, his one-year-old son by his second wife, than he was able to be with his four older daughters – in part by virtue of being more financially secure. “He is a total joy and has rejuvenated me and my outlook on life,” he says. He is also in the happy position of being able to compare notes with his eldest daughter, 35, who has children of a similar age. “She has tips on the latest kit that I wouldn’t have thought of,” he says. “The baby equipment scene is different. The prams are much more sophisticated. The car seats too. The Tommee Tippee machine for making baby milk (which I call the Tommee Titty). It’s definitely made it all easier.”Joshua from Indiana in the US had just packed his youngest child off to university when his second wife gave birth to their first child. He was back at the beginning, and discovered a huge difference in parenting philosophies. “With my first two children, I raised them how I had been raised, with yelling, spanking and things my current wife refers to as ‘punitive, authoritarian parenting’,” he says. “My current wife believes in gentle/peaceful parenting, and at first I thought she was full of crap and our two children would end up being entitled brats. But I’m happy to say that they’re now teens and are responsible and respectful. I have since reached out to my adult sons to apologise for how they were raised.”Paul, 66, also shudders to recall his attitude when his first daughter was born shortly before he landed a well-paid job in New York. “I was highly ambitious at that stage,” he says. “I used to leave for work at 6.30am and get home at 7pm, sometimes later. And to be perfectly frank, I wasn’t shy of going for a drink with my colleagues after work. You’d realise it was eight and think: ‘Ah well, may as well make a proper night of it.’” Now living in the UK with his second wife, he is “much more consciously” trying to be part of his young son’s life. “I look back on what my first wife must have had to put up with, and whether I was a particularly selfish individual, or that was what society was like, I can’t say.”I’ve brought up a set of kids who are successful adults. I’ve seen what went right and what went wrong. That’s an incredible set of expertise to bring to raising another childIndeed, what soon becomes apparent from speaking to these older fathers is that, however much parenting has changed, by far the biggest changes have occurred within the men themselves. Perhaps this is indeed how society changes: from the inside out.A common theme is that the first time, having a child was “just part of the deal”as one man put it – whereas the second time around, they approach fatherhood with a lot more care.“I don’t know if I appreciated the whole miracle of it as much the first time around,” says David Bawden, 59, who conceived a child with a second partner 20 years after his first, after several rounds of IVF treatment. “I don’t know if it’s just because it was the 1990s or the noughties and everybody was more relaxed, but maybe we guard life a bit more zealously now. Of course, we all complain vociferously about how little sleep we get, but I’d forgotten in the intervening years what a joy it is.” His own parents are equally delighted. “My father, a nonagenarian with dementia, is bowled over every time I tell him, because he doesn’t remember the previous time I did.”Young couples often cite housing issues, precarious finances and demanding careers as reasons for delaying parenthood. These are all much less of a problem at the other end of life. Christopher, the baby equipment enthusiast, feels it’s all much easier for him now as he’s financially secure, with two properties and a part-time nanny. “One thing I’ve noticed is that parental stress is dictated by whether you can afford additional assistance or not. Thankfully, we can.”Then there is the perspective that wisdom can give you. When Tom Wenger’s first two children were born in the mid-1970s, he was in the most intense period of his medical training. “My wife and I talked about 50/50 parenting, but it was semi-ridiculous really,” he says. “I worked 100 hours a week. So just by virtue of the fact that I was extremely busy, I had no time to devote to my children. There are many pictures of me fast asleep with my babies on my shoulder.”View image in fullscreenTom Wenger, 79, and his daughter Lilly, 16, at home in North Carolina.Photograph: Jeremy M Lange/The GuardianNow 79, having retired from a career as a cardiologist, and living in North Carolina in the US with Lilly, his 16-year-old adopted daughter from his third marriage, he feels he not only has the benefit of time, but also of experience. “I’ve brought up a set of kids who are successful adults. I’ve seen what went right and what went wrong. That’s an incredible set of expertise to be able to bring to raising another child.”Nevertheless, he says he experiences frequent “momsplaining” from fellow parents at the school gate who doubt what a man born in 1945 could possibly bring to the life of a living, breathing gen Z teen. “If a woman says to me something about how I’m bringing up my daughter, of course I listen,” he says. “It’s only polite and caring. If I hear an idea that seems better than what I’m doing, I’ll grab that in a second. But I keep my own counsel – because I feel like I know what I’m doing.”There really is no such thing as a typical family. Lives follow unusual shapes; traumatic events intercede; love swoops up stealthily; very few of us are living the life we planned. Tom Wenger is, it turns out, not only a septuagenarian father, but a septuagenariansinglefather, having lost his third wife to suicide when Lilly was six. “I’m still in good health – heck I still play soccer with guys younger than you,” he tells me. “My worry was that I would die when she was young. I had to worry about getting cancer or having a heart attack or whatever. When my wife died, I knew that my daughter would need to live on her own at a much earlier age than most children.”As uncommon as late-stage fatherhood is, it is part of a trend. The age of both parents has been increasing steadily for the last 50 years. My mother was 25 when I was born, and recalls being described as an “elderly mother” in the maternity ward. Now that is well below thenational average for mothers of 30.9. The average age of fathers, meanwhile, was 33.8 in the UK in 2023. The mostrecent government datashows 10% of new fathers in the 40-44 age-range and 5.1% aged 45 or over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

This is a concern to those who work in the field.“There’s a lot of evidence about the impact of male age on children,” Allan Pacey, a professor of andrology at the University of Manchester, told me when I was researching the rise in “sperm freezing”. “The data has been around for 20 or 30 years. But we tend to ignore it, as it bucks what society wants.”There is indeed a growing body of research linking older men to a wide range of adverse outcomes, such as a greater likelihood of miscarriage and stillbirths, as well as higher risks of conditions including autism, ADHD, schizophrenia and leukaemia. Children with fathers over 40 at their birth are almost six times more likely to have autism than those whose fathers are under 30, according toone study.The things I enjoy the most? A child looking out of the window on a normal Tuesday afternoon. Picking them up from school on an autumn day. It’s those little moments. Nothing specialSuch risks were largely unknown to Gary Jenkins, whose son is neurodivergent. “It’s a facet of older parenting that I didn’t realise is so prevalent,” he says. Still, he doesn’t think this knowledge would have altered his decision one way or another. “You never know what’s coming. I’ve got a feeling that second chances with children are a lot more common than I thought. I’ve met loads of people who have unusual situations with their kids.”There are also the emotional risks attached to second-time fatherhood, particularly when it comes to families from earlier relationships. Paul – the man who happily stayed out drinking with colleagues when his daughter was young – did eventually come good as a parent, he assures me. “Don’t get me wrong. Those early years I wasn’t there so much, but when she was older, I was more present. We developed common interests. We’d go to football matches every week and became extremely close.”They were extremely close, that is, until he told his daughter that he was expecting another child with his second wife, and she cut him off. “My daughter didn’t like that at all. She responded extremely negatively. The justification she gave was: ‘You’re not going to be a proper grandfather to my child if you’ve a child of your own.’ I said: ‘It doesn’t need to be like that. I’ve got plenty of love to go round.’ Unfortunately, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy.”In all, Paul sounds conflicted about late-life fatherhood. “We’re lucky that we can cope with it physically just about. But mentally, I do struggle. There are times when I feel a bit guilty. Our son doesn’t yet realise that our family is a bit different. My mum died at 87; my dad was 89. The thought that my son will be in his early 20s when he’s dealing with all that … I feel like it’s something I’m putting on him that he wouldn’t necessarily have asked for.”There’s a lot more anxiety around parenting, too, he says: about the specifics of child rearing (“there are all these books, websites, WhatsApp …”) and about the world in general. “We had the miners’ strikes and the threat of nuclear Armageddon, and a country that was virtually ungovernable and all that – but we just sort of sailed through it. Whereas now, it feels like the world is coming to an end before my son’s even had the chance to grow up. I don’t know if this is something you just feel when you’re getting older – or if the world really is a worse place.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve weirdly got a slightly more flexible idea than a thirtysomething might because I’ve seen such a spell of history,’ says Tom Wenger, pictured with his daughter Lilly.Photograph: Jeremy M Lange/The GuardianTom Wenger, the 79-year-old widower, is in little doubt that things are getting worse. “As someone who was born in the US at the end of the second world war, I’ve just gone through nearly 80 years of the easiest living it is possible to have had for the average non-aristocratic person,” he says. “You can’t find a period in the history of humankind as good. I don’t think the next 80 years are going to be like that for my daughter. I can see war. Civil war. Enormous disruption. Beyond anything we’ve experienced.”The lesson he has taken from this is that his daughter will need to be able to cope with adversity. “I don’t think that telling children to work well in school and aim for a really good career is going to prepare them for an extremely disruptive world. I went to a private school and my first set of kids went to private school. I used to think that was the most important thing. But when I became a single father with a kid who had gone through emotional trauma, I knew that the most important thing was not to get her academics sorted out, but to get her emotions sorted out.”Overcoming difficulties is such an important part of growing up, he adds. “It doesn’t mean putting obstacles in people’s way, but it does mean accepting obstacles as a learning experience. So I think I’ve weirdly got a slightly more flexible idea than maybe a thirty- or fortysomething might have about what to expect, because I’ve seen such a spell of history.”He loves maths, electronics. Whatever he likes doing, I like doing with him. He’s an only child – and I have plenty of timeYet the thing about children is that they have no awareness of history, not at first. They are by their nature extremely present. They force you right into the moment. When I ask Paul what he enjoys most about his time with his young son, the phone line initially goes quiet. “It’s the very little things,” he says eventually. “A child looking out of the window on a normal Tuesday afternoon. Picking them up from school on an autumn day. Sorry, I’m getting quite emotional. It’s those little moments. Nothing special.”Gary Jenkins is also happy to spend his time doing whatever his eight-year-old wants to do. “I homeschooled him for five months and really enjoyed that experience,” he says. “He loves maths, electronics. I like it when I see him interacting with other people. I enjoy being surprised by what he talks about. Whatever he likes doing, I like doing with him. He’s an only child – and I have plenty of time.”Of course, he has one eye on the future – when he is no longer here. He has devoted far more time to putting his finances in order than he ever did when he was in his 30s. “Now I take it all a lot more seriously,” he says. But however particular the circumstances – however vast the hinterland – this is really just a hyper-intense version of what all of us fathers have to deal with. The uncertainty. The anxiety. The joys. That desperate attempt to impart what little wisdom we have before we give our children up to the world. They’re only yours to borrow.“What can you do, except try to make it the happiest place it can be?” says Gary. “When I’m gone, I want him to think: ‘Yeah, nice. Thanks Dad.’”Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Naomi Larsson PiñedaSat 8 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareChiara, 56I find pleasure in being wanted; there’s a primal, radical desire thereWhen Frank and I met more than 25 years ago, there wasn’t a lot of reading material around on BDSM. Looking back, we were doing things without knowing there were terms for them. We were partying a lot and sex was super kinky – we didn’t have a filter and it allowed us to be who we were.We began to notice that I have responsive desire, rather than proactive desire. For example, at the beginning Frank would check if I wanted to have sex and I told him just go for it, you never need to check with me. And it’s been that way ever since. Only in the past three years, when doing more research around BDSM, did we realise there is a name for this – “free use” – and that I have given him a blanket consent to sex.I’m not sure where the psychological motivation comes from, but my body responds to having sex this way. It is as if every cell in my body lights up and, even if I won’t have an orgasm, I feel great for the rest of the day, sometimes for the next few days. I find pleasure in being wanted; there’s a primal, radical desire there.It doesn’t come from a place of him wanting to “be the boss”, but from a place of care. Outside sex, for example, Frank takes care of the house finances.It doesn’t come from a place of him wanting to ‘be the boss’, but it comes from a place of careWe are parents, and while our kids were growing up we had sex, but it was more for survival than excitement. Now they are older and spend less time in the house, we’ve had more time to learn about BDSM and get in touch with the community. It’s been incredible to discover the things we’ve been doing instinctually are actually symbolic and meaningful. We now have this new vocabulary and set of tools, so we can channel our sexual energy into more experimentation.I am very powerful and independent in my work life – hardly anybody says no to me. So the fact that I have somebody who challenges me is brilliant. Our relationship makes me feel as if I’ve won the lottery of life because I have exactly what I need and want, with a person that I trust – and we have so much fun.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I also knew the sex I wanted to have, and that some people may have judged for it. I lacked self-confidence and felt as if I was hiding. It was frightening because I don’t want to harm anyone. But, of course, that point of view came from a lack of understanding. Then I met Chiara and what we were doing was risky and adventurous, but we didn’t have a name for it. We were just having fun.After three years together we had kids, and things calmed down. It was only when the kids went to university that we resumed having the kind of sex we’d had when we first met. With the benefit of 20 years’ experience, we’ve realised what we were doing was BDSM. It almost came as a shock to me.I came to terms with my role as a dom because it was something that the woman I love wantedThe bondage and masochism isn’t a big part of our sex life – it’s the dominance and submission that we work with. I came to terms with my role as a dom because it was something that the woman I love wanted. If she wants me to dominate her, I will. It brings her such happiness, and that makes me feel good. The sub has all the power. And for me, being the dom means getting a chance to celebrate and recognise my strength, but in a loving manner.We’ve got a trustworthy relationship, both sexually and in other areas of our lives. Chiara will do anything for me. We have a free use agreement where she doesn’t refuse sex, but I know not to take advantage of that, and she trusts me not to tell her to do anything she wouldn’t want to. For example, if we’re at a bar I don’t ask what she wants to drink, I’ll say: “You’re going to have a white wine.” It’s a 24/7 power exchange. I am pleased to do it, and I take it as a responsibility. It gives me a sense of worth. This kind of respect and trust is wonderful.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Parmesan, anchovies, kimchi, garlic, gochujang and sesame oil combine to create a “wow” dish that is savoury, complex, rich and deliciously spiced. Serve as a showstopping side, or turn it into a main meal by adding a fried egg, pickles and a lightly dressed green salad. A mandoline helps slice the sweet potatoes evenly, but a steady hand will also do the trick.Kimchi dauphinoisePrep20 minCook1 hr 30 min, plus restingServes6 as a light meal, 8 as a side20g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing70g parmesan, finely grated50g cheddar, coarsely grated800g sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced into thin rounds about the width of a £1 coin (3-4mm)½ tsp fine sea salt1 leek, root cut off and discarded, the rest thinly sliced6 garlic cloves, peeled and minced6 anchovies(8g), roughly chopped1 tbsp gochujang paste250ml whole milk150ml double cream400g kimchi,roughly chopped20g panko breadcrumbs1 tsp sesame or neutral oil1 tsp sesame seeds(optional)Spring onions, thinly slicedHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and grease a 20cm x 30cm baking dish with butter.

But some of Musk’s longstanding positions lead a straight line to his far-right sympathiesChris McGrealSat 8 Feb 2025 08.24 ESTFirst published on Sat 8 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTShareView image in fullscreenMusk’s embrace of the far right has raised urgent questions about what Musk’s political beliefs and how he intends to use his newfound power.Composite: Angelica Alzona/Guardian Design; Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty ImagesElon Muskis not a people person, as millions around the world will be able to attest after the planet’s richest man cut off food supplies, healthcare and probably evenlife itselfto some of the most vulnerable without so much as a fore- or afterthought.Musk sees himself as a data man, wielding numbers like a machete to slash and burn his way through government waste and corruption as he leads the rightwing charge to capture the US state.Within days of Musk dispatching his minions to kick down the doors of the US Agency for International Development (USAid) and rifle through its finances, the agency was in effect out of business. Musk claimed USAid was “a criminal organisation” and full of Marxists – an assertion called “laughable” by the agency’s former administrator under George W Bush, Andrew Natsios, who describes himself as a conservative Republican.Musk didn’t care. Less than three weeks afterDonald Trump’s inauguration, the head of the new “department of government efficiency” (Doge), a special group that Trump created, has built an extensive power base in Washington of a kind not seen before.Trump has given free rein to Musk to send his operatives into more than a dozen federal agencies to look for evidence of mismanagement and subversion, and to generally create chaos, outside of the usual bounds of oversight and regulation.Crucially, Musk now in effect controls the office of personnel management (OPM), which oversees federal employment. He immediately encouraged more than 2 million government workers to resign with the stated aim of forcing a few hundred thousand out the door.View image in fullscreenA supporter of Donald Trump interrupts an anti-Doge protest outside the Department of Labor in Washington on Wednesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIt’s clear who Musk thinks should be running the country instead, from his recruitment to Doge of “special government employees” from his own companies and the wider tech industry to storm the federal citadels. They include a significant proportion of young male software engineers of the kind who tend to worship tech billionaires like Musk, including a teenager who has gone by “Big Balls” online.Few, if any, have undergone the security clearances other government workers need to access sensitive and personal information. If they had, Doge might have been discouraged from hiring another recruit from Silicon Valley, Marko Elez, who was sent into the US treasury department, where he had access to taxpayer records. Elez resigned on Thursday after the Wall Street Journalrevealedhe had posted racist messages on social media and defended eugenics.“Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” Elez wrote onXin July.Hewas reinstatedon Friday.On the face of it, Musk is implementing Trump’s commitment to cut spending, “dismantle the deep state” and sack “rogue bureaucrats”. But his embrace of the far right, including an unrestrained endorsement of the German nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD), and what looked to much of the world like aNazi saluteat Trump’s inauguration celebrations, has raised urgent questions about Musk’s political beliefs and how he intends to use his newfound power.As it happens, much of what Musk is doing is also good for his businesses, including scrapping regulatory bodies and curtailing the power of unions and workers. The labor board, which upholds workers’ rights, has been frozen and agencies that regulated the financial industry have either been scrapped or told to abandon key parts of their work.Musk’s politics have been eclectic. In the past, he has backed universal basic income and a tax on carbon emissions. At the same time, he has a deep dislike of trade unions and public transport because it means being around “random strangers, one of whom might be a serial killer”. He espouses a visceral hostility to diversity programmes and appears to regard those who believe in helping the less fortunate as subversive.Thrown into this mix is Musk’s fascination with thepro-natalism movement, for which he has done his bit by fathering 12 children, and his hope that one day his rocket company, SpaceX, will help them colonise Mars.Raised in South Africaunder apartheid, Musk is clearly suspicious of democracy and the leaders it produces. His grandfather headed a fringe political movement in Canada in the 1930s, Technocracy Incorporated, which sought to abolish democracy in favour of government by elite technicians, but its overtones of fascism saw it banned during the second world war.Musk shows some of the same tendencies, as do other libertarian-leaningSilicon Valleybillionaires unhappy with the messiness of elected government. He has spoken in support of direct democracy, where policies and other issues are decided by popular referendums rather than elected representatives.In the meantime, Musk appears happy to embrace the US version of the “strongman” ruler through the Republican right’s “unitary executive theory”, which regards the authority of the president as paramount and Congress as an impediment to the implementation of his or her will.Over the years, Musk has described himself as “not a conservative” and “politically moderate”. He backed the Democratic candidate in every presidential election going back to Barack Obama’s victory in 2008 until he soured on the party in the past few years.View image in fullscreenBarack Obama and Elon Musk in 2010.Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters“In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party. But they have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican. Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold,” hewrote on Xin 2022.But there were clues to other motives, including a statement that he would be voting Republican because of Joe Biden’s support for trade unions and what he regarded as insufficient Democratic backing for his companies.Not long before last year’s presidential election, Musk declared that Trump would save American democracy from Democrats trampling on individual liberties. But he kept moving ever further to the right in public, with an open embrace of racist European political leaders, including the AfD, and the promotion of claims of a “white genocide” in the country of his birth, South Africa.Musk’s biographer, Walter Isaacson,has linkedhis shift from Obama voter to cheerleader for the AfD to the transition of his daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson.Wilson was 16 when she texted a relative: “Hey, I’m transgender, and my name is now Jenna. Don’t tell my dad.” The day after Wilson turned 18 in 2022, she changed her name because of “gender identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form”.Musk told Isaacson he was sanguine about the change but then Wilson became a fervent Marxist and wouldn’t speak to him any more, a situation he described as one of the most painful of his life.“She went beyond socialism to being a full communist and thinking that anyone rich is evil,” Musk told the author.Musk blamed Wilson’s progressive Los Angeles school and said he was disturbed at the “woke mind virus” holding back America.After Californiapassed a lawbarring school districts from requiring teachers to tell parents of changes to a student’s sexual orientation and gender identity, Musk announced he was moving the headquarters of his two largest companies, SpaceX and X, to Texas. He said that the law caused “massive destruction of parental rights” and put children at risk of “permanent damage”.Musk did not say that moving his companies also had significant tax advantages for himself and his businesses, which would additionally be subject to fewer climate regulations than in California.Still, his apparent anger over his daughter’s transition appears to have set in motion a broader hostility toward identity issues, and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes, a favourite target of the Trumpian right. Musk announced that the words “cis” and “cisgender” were considered slurs on X, and he came out against pronouns, tweeting that they “suck”.In late 2022, another tweet linked Musk’s hostility toward the way people choose to identify themselves – an odd position for a man who claims to be a champion of free speech – to his anger at the Biden administration’s Covid restrictions.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Elon Musk in November 2024.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersMusk mocked Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, who was instrumental in the lockdown and other measures to contain the crisis.“My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,”he wrote.Some saw the tweet as evidence that Musk was nowopenly identifying with the far right, which defied mask regulations and stay-at-home orders and called for Fauci to be locked up for intruding on their liberties.But while Musk’s hostility toward pronouns was personal, Covid regulations touched on his businesses and net worth.Muskrefused to closehis Tesla factory at the height of the pandemic, claiming without evidence that “panic” over the virus would do more damage than the disease itself. He disparaged social distancing, predicted that the virus would claim few lives in the US (it eventually claimed more than 1.2 million), and described the lockdown as “fascist” and “erasing people’s freedoms”. Musk tweeted a meme comparing Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to Hitler over his government’s Covid restrictions.Musk may have dressed up his position as a concern about people’s welfare but its immediate effect was to keep his factories rolling even if the people working in them were at greater risk of infection and death. And while Musk claimed a principled position in favour of individual liberty, he has a history of suppressing the rights of his own workers.In 2023, he said that he disagreed with the concept of trade unions.“I just don’t like anything whichcreates a lords-and-peasantssort of thing,” he told the New York Times Dealbook Summit. “Unions naturally try to create negativity in a company.”One reason Musk may not like unions is they tend to stand up for their members. He has faced accusations from former employees of aggressively using a secretive dispute-resolution process to fend off repeated claims ofsexual and racial harassmentwithin his companies, including accusations of women enduring a “frat house” atmosphere of groping and other abuses ignored and even perpetrated by high-level managers.Tesla haspaid outmillions of dollars to Black workers subjected toracial harassment.Yet, while Musk restricts the rights of his employees to seek redress from the courts, he and his companies filed at least 23 lawsuits in federal courts in the year to August 2024,according to Fortune magazine.They include a legal action by X against the Center for Countering Digital Hate overa reportaccusing the social network of making millions of dollars out of accounts spewing hate from “neo-Nazis, white supremacists, misogynists and spreaders of dangerous conspiracy theories”. A California judge threw out the lawsuit last year,sayingit was clear the “case is about punishing the defendants for their speech”.Musk will probably spend a lot more time being frustrated by the courts. Judges have already put on hold his push for mass resignations from the civil service and placed some restrictions on Doge’s mass collection of data. Federal workers, unions and civil rights organisations are lining up a flurry of lawsuits to challenge Musk’s actions.But the courts themselves may become a target for Musk as he works to tear down the old order.Isaacson in his biography wrote that Musk once described being in “a state of war at all times” as one of his default settings.No one thinks that, so long as Trump continues to regard the billionaire as more of an asset than a liability, Musk’s thirst for power will stop at gutting federal agencies. The question is where he will launch his next offensive."

While he is expected to report a 1.8% drop in annual pre-tax profits to £6.1bn on Friday, he will be able to hail the fact that the government’s stake is months away from disappearing.The Treasury spent nearly £46bn to bail out NatWest, then known as Royal Bank of Scotland, at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, leaving taxpayers owning about 84% of the lender. That stake has since dwindled to less than 8%, despite a campaign to sell shares to the public,fronted by Sir Trevor McDonald, having been ditched. Instead, Thwaite now expects to return the bank to private hands by June.NatWest bosses are alsoreportedly considering boosting the bonus poolby up to 25% to £450m, giving its bankers much to celebrate.There will be far less cheer at HSBC. Bankers at the high street rival are steeling themselves for a swathe of job cuts, with new chief executive Georges Elhedery due to reveal the details of a major restructuring plan, alongside its results on 19 February.First announced in October, the overhaul involves dividing the bank’s operations into eastern and western markets in a move that many believe could help the bank navigate competing political pressures from Washington and Beijing.And while Elhedery had alreadysaid he would cut jobs and let some of his most senior staff go, he shocked bankers last month by announcing plans to shut parts of its investment banking operations – including those handling mergers and acquisitions, and equity fundraising for listed companies – in the UK, US and Europe.Morale is horrible. Everyone is panicking, everyone has sent out CVsBanker at HSBCIt is unclear how many of its nearly 214,000 global staff, including its 40,000 UK workers, will be axed as part of those plans, and bankers fear their bonuses will also suffer.“Morale is horrible,” one UK-based HSBC investment banker told theObserver. “Everyone is panicking, everyone has sent out CVs.” And for those yet to jump ship, patience is waning. “What’s the motivation for me to work when I’m not going to be rewarded?” the staffer said.Fears over a combined £44bn compensation bill over the motor finance commission scandal could also cast a cloud over full-year earnings for UK banks, including Lloyds andBarclays.Lenders have been grappling with the fallout of a shock court judgment in Octoberthat vastly expanded a Financial Conduct Authority investigationinto motor finance commissions and sent compensation estimates soaring. The landmark ruling determined that paying a “secret” commission to car dealers who had arranged the loans without disclosing the sum and terms of that commission to borrowers was unlawful.Lloyds is expected to suffer a 15% drop in full-year profits to £6.4bn, according to average analyst estimates. But predicting future profits comes with an asterisk, given uncertainty over the outcome of a supreme court case in April where car finance companies hope to overturn the motor finance ruling.While Lloyds is not a party to the court case, it has the biggest exposure to car loans out of the UK’s high street banks. RBC Capital estimates that it could be on the hook for up to £4.6bn. Chief executive of Lloyds Charlie Nunn may struggle to drum up excitement over his progress towards his five-year strategic plan, which has involved branch closures and a major push into digital banking.There is one bright spot for UK bankers, though.Barclays is expected to post a 23% jump in annual profits to £8bn on Thursday, according to Shore Capital, leaving staff in line for large payouts. Its dealmakers are also set fair, as bankers step into the“go mode”some claim Donald Trump’s return to the White House has injected into Wall Street, where the UK bank has offices.Barclaysbulked up its half-year bonus poolfor the first time in three years in August, signalling that there could be larger payouts for bankers who can now earn 10 times their salarysince the EU bonus cap was scrapped. Only the motor finance payouts, estimated to cost it £442m by RBC, may provide a blemish for the bank, which may be the standout performer in a rocky reporting season.Explore more on these topicsBankingObserver business agendaNatWest GroupLloyds Banking GroupBarclaysExecutive pay and bonusesanalysisShareReuse this content"

The playlist skews towards nostalgic hits from the 80s, 90s and early 2000s. Cis men are politely asked to just stay away.Founded inChicagoby two friends in their 40s, the Earlybirds Club is a party designed for women and trans and non-binary people who have jobs and responsibilities that start early in the morning – but who still want a chance to dance crazily with their friends.The dancing starts at 6pm and ends around 10. Just a year after Laura Baginski and Susie Lee threw their first early-evening party in Chicago, the event has already started touring the country, from Brooklyn toLos Angeles. And the founders, whose clever idea has become a full-time business, keep getting more requests, from as far away as Dubai, Mumbai and Vancouver, as well as across the US, Baginski said. Earlybirds Club’s first anniversary party this weekend quickly sold out a Chicago venue that holds 1,000 people, she said.View image in fullscreenAttenders go all out for Earlybirds Club’s themed decades parties.Photograph: Meagan Shuptar“Everyone is smiling and screaming lyrics at the top of their lungs. It’s an experience that, especially in these times, feels so necessary and therapeutic,” Baginski said.By their 40s and 50s, many women are caretakers for others. “It’s important for us to remember to create joy for ourselves – because in this age group, we don’t do that,” Lee said.The two women, both 49, have known each other since high school, when they both worked on the school paper and were, in their words, “dorks”, though Lee also identified as a “goth new wave kid”. Neither has a background in party promotion: Lee was a makeup artist for 20 years, while Baginski was a journalist and then worked in marketing for non-profits.Both founders are definitively gen X; their DJ is a millennial, “so she understands what millennials want”, Baginski said. But their party has attracted a much wider range of generations than they expected.View image in fullscreen‘It’s important for us to remember to create joy for ourselves,’ said co-founder Susie Lee.Photograph: Kenzie Jean“We’ve had people bring their daughters,” Baginski said. “We’ve also had women in their 60s, sometimes in their early 70s, coming, which is so cool. I think younger women love to see that – I know I do.”They also did not expect just how enthusiastic partygoers would be about a chance to dress up, the founders said – devoting time to finding vintage outfits and doing their hair in decades-old styles. “We did a 90s prom where people bought prom dresses in a 90s style to wear,” Baginski said. “One woman wore the same dress that she wore to her 1989 prom, which is like, kudos, you win.”While the primary goal of the party is offering a fun night out that focuses on friends, not flirtation, the dancefloor experience often ends up being cathartic, the founders said. Lee is a cancer survivor still dealing with health challenges, and when the founders share her story at events, they often hear from participants who are also cancer survivors or in treatment.The Earlybirds Club’s first foray into Los Angeles in January ended up being disrupted by wildfires, but some partygoers showed up for the pair of parties anyway. “Was not feeling up for a dance party last night … but it turned out to be therapeutic and maybe exactly what people needed,” one woman at posted on Instagram after the event. “I saw ladies crying while dancing and it just made sense.”Explore more on these topicsCultureClubbingWest CoastChicagoLos AngelesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So they turned back to bison and mushroomsThe Siċaŋġu Nation in South Dakota is building community and climate resilience through traditional foodsSupported byAbout this contentGrace Hussain, Sentient MediaSat 8 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTShareOn a Wednesday summer evening on the Rosebud Reservation, members of the Siċaŋġu Nation arrange 12 tables to form a U in the parking lot of a South Dakota Boys & Girls Club. The tables at the Siċaŋġu Harvest Market are laden with homemade foods for sale: tortillas, cooked beans, pickles and fresh-squeezed lemonade.The market is one of many ways the non-profit increases access totraditional and healthful foodsthat also happen to come with alow climate impact. The Lakota, of which Siċaŋġu is one of seven nations, were traditionally hunters and gatherers, but today, theSiċaŋġu Co non-profitis building on both new and old traditions to fulfill its mission.The market is one component of the group’s food-sovereignty work, which also includes cultivating mushrooms and caring for a bison herd. Siċaŋġu Co is also working on housing, education and programs that support physical and spiritual wellness. But food came first.“We started with food because it’s so universal. Not just as a need but as a grounding cultural and family force,” said Michael Prate, who spearheaded the program in its initial stages. “It’s where people come together to build relationships.”The food inequities that Siċaŋġu Co is working to address can be traced back to the eradication of bison herds by white settlers during the 1800s. For many Lakota, bison are akin to family and play anintegral part in both their physical and spiritual lives. Millions of bison used to roam these plains, but when colonizers pushed west, theyslaughtered the animals en masse, both to make room for the cattle herds they brought with them, and to disrupt the Lakota way of life and force them on to reservations.Mushrooms for health and sustenanceAt the market, Siċaŋġu Co member Frederick Fast Horse shows off the mushrooms that he has foraged and raised to passersby. According to an important story passed down inLakota history, the Lakota were once cave dwellers, and mushrooms were key to their survival, Fast Horse says. These critical fungi are more than just calories, as Fast Horse believes mushrooms are part of what helpedLakota stay so healthy for centuries, until the effects of colonization, which shifted the nation’s diet to a heavy reliance on dairy and processed meats. “Every single mushroom actually coincides and targets a specific organ inside of your body,” he said.Every single mushroom actually coincides and targets a specific organ inside of your bodyFrederick Fast Horse, Siċaŋġu Co memberIn addition to being a skilled mycologist and forager, Fast Horse is the chef at the non-profit’s school, where he is reintroducing culturally significant ingredients to the students. Fast Horse makes breakfast and lunch for about 70 students and staff each day. The typical fare is pretty simple, he says: dishes made of just a handful of ingredients, plus a broth and spices.In collaboration with school leadership, Fast Horse is developing dietary guidelines that reflect more traditional foods and agricultural practices. This way of eating amounts to “living off of the land” – it means eating “all the foods that are already around us, everything that you grow, and very simplistic methods of preparing food and eating it”, said Fast Horse.The diet they’re launching at the school isn’t just culturally important; it’s also better for the students’ health, according to Fast Horse, who is critical of the modern, industrialized food system.A diet that leans more on mushrooms and plants also happens to be more climate-friendly than the typical US diet, in which beef is consumed four times more than the global average. Between12% and 20% of global emissionscomes from meat and dairy farms. While the goal of Siċaŋġu Co isn’t explicitly to eat less meat, it does aim to boost access to traditional foods. This includes both low-emissions plants and mushrooms that are locally harvested, and bison raised on a very small scale,treated as “kin”, in a way that looks nothing like a factory farm.Native-owned bison are familyRosebud Reservation is home to thelargest Native-owned bison herd, with more than a thousand animals roaming 28,000 acres (11,000 hectares). Bison are ruminants, like cattle, which means they, too, belch methane, butbison offer a variety of ecosystem benefitsthanks to the way they live on the land.Whileherds of cattle also grazenearby, the differences are stark. Siċaŋġu Nation member Karen Moore, who manages the food-sovereignty initiative and lives on the reservation, describes how grazing cows tend to concentrate together, sometimes feasting on a single type of plant until it’s depleted. Bison are more likely to cover more ground when they graze, eating a variety of plants, which has a gentler impact on the ecosystem.Last year, two animals from the nation’s herd were donated to the school. With that meat, Fast Horse says, he has been able to replace 75% of the red meat the school would otherwise have procured.Getting the students to eat more culturally significant foods is not without its challenges, however. If one popular student decides they don’t like a particular dish, then all the other kids follow suit, says Fast Horse. He avoids the problem by trying to make foods more palatable – for example, by grinding mushrooms into small pieces. “They get the flavor, but they don’t see the actual mushroom,” he said.Another Siċaŋġu Co member, Mayce Low Dog, teaches community cooking classes that instruct participants in how to use traditional ingredients in their dishes.‘A sanctuary’: how neglected Native American communities are organizing their own food hubsRead moreThe work is paying off. “It seems like more people are into trying weirder foods, not necessarily like your tomatoes and cucumbers,” said Moore. “It’s been really, really exciting to see.” Her co-workers raved about her stinging nettle pesto, made from plants she’d foraged.Harvesting local plants is also a critical part of the group’s work. The nation has “been in crisis for hundreds of years”, said Moore, but harvesting their own food is part of “getting back to being self-reliant”.On a brisk morning during my visit, Moore and Low Dog invite me to join them to harvest local plants that they’ll dry and turn into herbal teas, both for the farmers’ market and a community-supported agriculture program that subsidizes food shares for some residents. The teas are a way residents can reconnect with traditional foods even if they’re not skilled foragers themselves.Gravel crunches under the tires as we pull off the main road, and slowly roll along the banks of a pond. Along the way, Moore and Low Dog keep their eyes peeled for useful plants for tea. For both, foraging is a newer skill. As we walk, they consult each other about different plants, making sure they’re selecting the correct ones and that everything is ready for harvest. It’s a skill they’re intentionally learning from each other and their elders.Moore reaches down to gather some ceyeka, or wild mint, for the teas. She’s sure to leave behind about half of the plant, to ensure the plant continues to grow on the banks so there’s more when they come back again on a later day.Forging connection and communityVictoria Contreras was introduced to the food-sovereignty initiative as a high school volunteer. Now, two years later, she manages the Siċaŋġu Harvest Market, and has learned to be more intentional about incorporating Indigenous ingredients into her meals. “I’m actively looking for something that I can swap out, or a recipe that I can try,” she said.In addition to expanding community knowledge of traditional ingredients, the harvest market and other programs have brought community residents together. The market helps create new friendships and revive old connections, says Sharon LaPointe, who helps her daughter, Sadie, with her stand selling flavored lemonades and homemade pickles and bread. It’s a sentiment shared by many of the vendors there that Wednesday.They’re here to teach us how to be food sovereign because someday, food is going to get too expensive for our peopleBrandi Charging Eagle, Siċaŋġu CoMichael Prate, who helped get the group off the ground, remembers some nation members weren’t so sure about the group in the early days. “I think people have a skepticism that things are going to go away,” he said, “because that’s the trend,” as many programs that pop up on the reservation tend to be temporary. There are challenges, including growing crops under the harsh weather conditions in South Dakota, conditions that will become even more severe in a changing climate.The many shifting challenges facing the Siċaŋġu Nation are why food sovereignty is so critical. “They’re here to teach us how to be food sovereign because someday, food is going to get too expensive for our people,” said Brandi Charging Eagle, who is part of the Siċaŋġu non-profit, but also follows its mission in her own home, where she is teaching her children how to grow their own food. “The prices of food are going up, but our wages aren’t.”The Siċaŋġu Nation’s non-profit will have to stay nimble in order to survive. “There’s always going to be something else that the community is going to be weathering and adapting to,” Prate said. “That’s just reality.”This story is part of an ongoing serieson a just and climate-friendly food system, produced in collaboration with theGuardian,Nexus Media News, Sentient andYes!magazine, with funding from theSolutions Journalism Network, advisory support from Garrett Broad (Rowan University) and audience engagement throughProject Drawdown’s Global Solutions DiaryExplore more on these topicsFoodOur unequal earthNative AmericansIndigenous peoplesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Later photograph: Pål Hansen. Styling: Andie Redman. Grooming: Claire Woods. Archive image: John Stoddart/Getty ImagesBorn in London in 1968, Matt Goss was a member of Bros, the 80s pop group formed with his twin brother,Luke, and friend Craig Logan. The trio had hits including When Will I Be Famous? and I Owe You Nothing, before splitting in 1992. Matt went on to have a solo career, and recently concluded one of the longest residencies by a British artist in Vegas history. Bros reunited in 2017, coinciding with the Bafta-winning documentary Bros: After the Screaming Stops, which followed the fraught relationship between the twins, who are currently estranged. Matt will take his solo show on tour throughout March and April.This was taken in our biker jacket phase.I’m wearing one by Rebel Rockers of London and I’m happy I still fit into it; after turning 50 I could have been Fat Goss rather than Matt Goss. Was I happy about how I looked? I have always been confident about what’s inside my heart, less so my appearance, so I don’t think I felt great here. While I participated in certain aesthetic travesties over the years, the classic Bros look – the denim mixed with the jacket, the T-shirt and Dr Martens – is something that still feels relevant. As for the hair – I used Dax. Super greasy and thick. It was not kind on the scalp, but it looked fucking good.I’d describe myself back then as innocent and hopeful, but I can see in my eyes that I am wrestling with pain and smiling through it. My sister had been killed by a drunk driver the year before, and I was having to keep it together to do promo for Bros. I didn’t know where to put the grief, but somehow I managed it.I love my brother to my deepest core, but I’ve done my best to sustain the relationship, and now that is enoughAs much as I lived the lifestyle of a rock star, I was afraid to call myself one. I was born and raised a south-east Londoner and my mum would have clipped me around the ear if I got too big for my boots – but “Bros mania” was real, and it was absolutely global. In every country that we went to we experienced mayhem, and we had the record sales to back it up. As a young man, that was very exciting, and now I can feel proud of that, unashamedly.People don’t acknowledge that when it all ended, I lost my job. One half of the company – my brother – decided to fold. I had to go with it, and it was terrifying. As much as it was heart-wrenching, it also created good butterflies. The feeling of: what next? I had youth on my side, and I could be optimistic. Do I still want to jump on stage with him? Absolutely. I’d like another Bros experience. Something massive, Bros on steroids. Bigger, the biggest. I don’t think the stars are aligned right now. It needs to be something that’s organic, and I ain’t chasing it any more.I lost a stone during the filming of After the Screaming Stops.I was constantly chasing my tail, trying to make things right between me and my brother, but everything I said was wrong. I realised we had a lot of unfinished business, me and him. There was still a lot of pain. Together we endured our sister’s loss but had to keep working, get on with our lives while dealing with this deep tragedy. My bodyguard Johnny died of a brain tumour. Then Mum passed. All these important people were dropping away from us, and me and my brother had not even remotely addressed it, or any of our issues.The happiest years of my life were when we were growing up in Camberwell. That humble childhood shaped me as a person – it was very basic, but with lots of loveAfter I watched the documentary, I realised I was this guy who just wanted to make everything OK, but at my expense, and that’s not acceptable any more. I love my brother to my deepest core, but I’ve done my best to sustain the relationship, and now that is enough. That kind of dynamic can allow you to keep trying to bury yourself – and I got very close to that at one stage. Do I mean that literally? Yeah, I do. Thankfully, I’m much more relaxed and at peace with the situation now.While I had an incredible time in Bros, my residency at Caesars Palace was just as extraordinary. When I first did Vegas, I got a bit of criticism. But I know I am good at what I do. I always smash a show and the audience leaves elevated – there’s comedy, a bit of booze and lots of music. When I walked on stage, I’d get a wink from the people working on the show. They knew I was about to raise the spirit of the room.The happiest years of my life were when we were growing up in Camberwell– it was my grandfather, Aunt Sally, my brother, Mum and me. That humble childhood shaped me as a person – it was very basic, but with lots of love. It taught me never to underestimate the power of the roast potato with white pepper. I was obsessed with Thunderbirds and there was a stall on East Street market that used to sell the models. Lady Penelope was the first puppet I ever fell in love with.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’ve always loved fast cars. I’ve always loved women. I’ve always loved sex and rock’n’roll – not the drugs. The only thing that changed was that I finally felt like a real man. I definitely became more comfortable in my skin – even if I look different from the guy in 1989. Life has its way with you and I think that comes out in your face, even your posture.I have boxed for 22 years, I’m going back to the gym, doing a bit of tennis, too. I’ve heard that racket sports are the way to go for longevity. Philanthropy and music is a great healer for me also. But my real coping mechanism is, and always has been, kindness. I like to be around good people. I don’t like to be around anyone who is too cool for school. I’ve realised the people that don’t get me, I probably wouldn’t want to hang out with anyway.Chesney Hawkes looks back: ‘It’s only now I can appreciate that The One and Only is a great record’Read moreOne thing people don’t realise about me is that I’m very dry.My sense of humour is sarcastic, to the point that if you don’t know me, you might think I’m insulting you. I think we are all too PC today – I feel like we’ve become terrified of each other, and it’s making us lonely. The banter between a man and woman is phenomenal – there’s something magical about two people with a sense of humour. Obviously there are men who are predatory, but I’m not talking about that. To give somebody a hug or to say, “You look lovely today” shouldn’t mean you’re hitting on someone. We have to find a way to be more emotionally intelligent; to sustain a connection. Banter is everything for me, so if respect is in place, then we should all be a little less afraid of each other.As for the guy in the photo, I love him. He dealt with so much. Sold millions of records. Had the longest-running residency in British Vegas history. Was the youngest artist to sell out and headline Wembley Stadium. I have a United Nations humanitarian award – something I am incredibly proud of. I’m doing a movie this year – which is terrifying, but in the best way. I am ready to bloody my knuckles on it. I’ve landed in such a phenomenal place as a person and even with the Bros situation, I have learned to relax and be joyful. What more could I ask for? I am a blessed man.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rwanda denies military support for the M23.But a UN report said last year Rwanda had about 4,000 troops in the DRC and profited from smuggling out of the country vast amounts of gold and coltan – a mineral vital for phones and laptops.Rwanda has accused the DRC of sheltering the FDLR, an armed group created by ethnic Hutus who massacred Tutsis during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s total chaos,” they said.The UN rights chief, Volker Türk, said: “If nothing is done, the worst may be yet to come for the people of the eastern DRC but also beyond the country’s borders.”Türk said nearly 3,000 people had been confirmed killed and 2,880 wounded since M23 entered Goma on 26 January, and final tolls were likely to be much higher. He also said his team was “currently verifying multiple allegations of rape, gang-rape and sexual slavery”.M23 has already installed its own mayor and local authorities in Goma. The group plans to infiltrate the national capital, Kinshasa, situated about 1,000 miles away.The DRC army, which has a reputation for poor training and corruption, has been forced into multiple retreats. The M23 offensive has raised fears of regional war, given that several countries are engaged in supporting DRC militarily, including South Africa, Burundi and Malawi.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoRwandaAfricaTanzanianewsShareReuse this content"

It ordered the shutdown of 15 pieces of equipment that did not have proper authorization.Revealed: US hazardous waste is sent to Mexico – where a ‘toxic cocktail’ of pollution emergesRead moreAuthorities said they found improperly stored material – in some cases in broken and leaking bags – in the company’s yard in the open air and in direct contact with the ground. The agency has given the company 15 days to get the material into proper storage.“The first thing is that they have to prevent it from being in contact with natural soil and they must move it to a space that complies with the regulations,” said Profepa’s head, Mariana Boy, in an interview about the initial findings of the inspection carried out in January.The Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab, a Mexican investigative journalism unit, collaborated with toxicologist Martín Soto Jiménez, who conducted sampling in neighboring homes and schools and found high levels of lead, cadmium and arsenic in soil and dust samples taken within 2km from the plant – including inside some homes and schools.Boy said her agency was trying to determine whether there is contamination from the plant affecting the community.If necessary, the inspectors could return to the plant to carry out sampling, Boy said.“We are going to be very thorough in our inspections to have sufficient information and guarantee access to environmental justice in our country,” said Boy in a press release.Also in a press release, Zinc Nacional said it had been cooperating with officials from the federal agency and has also had visits from state health, labor and environmental agencies, as well as local officials from San Nicolás de los Garza, the municipality where it is located.“We have collaborated with all of them and we reiterate that we are fully willing to address any observations identified as part of this process,” said the release. “Some of these inspections have resulted in requests for action that are being addressed. As agreed after these visits, the material will be removed from operating yards and covered to minimize the environmental footprint of our activities.”‘A trash can for the US’: anger in Mexico and Canada over toxic waste shipmentsRead moreAccording to Profepa, Zinc Nacional told its inspectors that the contents of the thousands of sacks in that yard are the company’s finished product: zinc oxide.Zinc Nacional imports electric arc furnace dust, also known as steel dust, from the US. A byproduct of steel recycling, it is hazardous waste and contains high levels of lead, cadmium and arsenic. These are toxic metals that can cause health problems ranging from brain damage in children to cancer. At its Monterrey-area plant, the company recycles the steel dust to obtain zinc.Bruce Lanphear, an international expert on the health effects of lead and a professor at Simon Fraser University, said that to understand any possible dangers posed by the plant, independent testing will be needed.“Did officials test the 30,000 tons of improperly stored material? I hope so,” he said. “Did they conduct extensive sampling of soil and dust in nearby communities and measure it for heavy metals? Those steps are essential to assessing the risk to residents.”On Friday, two federal legislators called on Mexico’s Congress to press the country’s environmental regulators for a deeper investigation of Zinc Nacional, questioning whether recent actions, which included the shutdown of the 15 pieces of equipment at the plant, are enough.“They have already audited and put seals [on the plant], but the company is still operating,” said Irais Reyes of the Movimiento Ciudadano party in a video posted on X. Her party is a minority party at the federal level, but holds the governorship where the plant is located in the state of Nuevo León.In the same post, her colleague, the legislator Laura Ballesteros, questioned whether companies in the United States have a motive to send their waste to Mexico to avoid US regulation.“This company [Zinc Nacional] releases toxic substances such as lead, cadmium and arsenic into the air, putting health in Nuevo León at serious risk,” she said. “How long will they continue to operate without consequences?”Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmerica's dirty dividePollutionCancerSteel industryHealthAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But when I met with him actually he was very sincere and very powerful.”As they exchanged photographs, Trump praised the 68-year-old Japanese premier as “good looking” – typically one of the former reality TV star’s highest orders of praise.And the US president laughed and said “that’s a very good answer” when Ishiba said he could not respond to a “theoretical question” about whether he would retaliate to any US tariffs.Trump, meanwhile, said that Japan’s Nippon Steel would make a major investment in US Steel but not take over the troubled company as previously negotiated.“They’ll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase,” Trump said. His predecessor, Joe Biden, had blocked the deal.‘Bring me my tariffs’: how Trump’s China plan was 40 years in the makingRead moreThe two leaders also doubled down on decades-old US ties in security and trade – despite fears that Trump could turn on Tokyo as he has with other US allies.– Trump said they had agreed to fight “Chinese economic aggression” and in a joint statement they condemned Beijing for “provocative activities” in the contested SouthChinaSea.They also called for a denuclearised North Korea, although Trump – who met its leader, Kim Jong-un, during his first term – said he wanted to have “relations” with Pyongyang.Behind Trump’s expressions of support were Japan’s promises of a $1tn investment in the US and to boost Japanese purchases of US defence equipment.Ishiba said his country was the biggest investor in the US and would step up its spending.The soft-spoken, cigarette-smoking Ishiba had rushed to Washington hoping to blunt the edge of Trump’s “America first” policies.Under Abe, Japan was shielded from some of Trump’s more punishing tendencies, such as sudden trade wars and pressure to increase financial contributions towards hosting US soldiers.Days after Trump’s first election victory, Abe hurried to deliver him a gold-plated golf club. Trump also hosted Abe’s widow, Akie, for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in December.So far the US president has slapped tariffs on China and ordered them on Mexico and Canada before halting them for a month.He has also pledged tariffs on the European Union and said on Friday that he would announce unspecified “reciprocal tariffs” next week.Explore more on these topicsJapanDonald TrumpChinaSteel industryTrump administrationAsia PacificUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It all began in a spare bedroom in SydneyRead more“What actually made the difference here is that we had theLabor partymake a decision not to run a candidate in Prahran, which left the field open for a former Labor MP and unofficial Labor candidate to run and funnel preferences to the Liberals,” Sandell said.“To be honest, I think that progressive voters and Labor voters will be pretty disappointed.”Sandell said turnout was also low. She believed a high proportion of young people who rent in the area may have moved since the 2022 election or were away.“Our primary vote held up despite this [being] a byelection held during the uni summer holidays, when traditionally a lot of young people … weren’t around [and] weren’t able to vote,” she said.“It bodes very well for the Greens and I am looking forward to winning back the seat at the general state election next year.”The byelection was triggered by the resignation of the former Greens MP Sam Hibbinsafter an affair with a staffer.The premier, Jacinta Allan, also held a press conference on Sunday, in which she conceded there was “more to do” to restore trust in her government after a collapse of support in Werribee.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liam had been waiting about a year to access the treatment in Queensland when last month, the Crisafulli governmentannounced an immediate banon doctors in the public system prescribing puberty blockers and hormones such as testosterone and oestrogen to treat gender dysphoria in minors.When Liam saw the news, his father said he had never seen him more distressed. Chris stayed up all night to be with his son.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThat distress turned to elation after the family found a doctor in Victoria – a sexual health specialist, Darren Russell – willing to treat Liam remotely and held their first consultation via telehealth this week.“You could see the instant change in his mental health,” Chris said of the appointment.“He’s the happiest he’s been in a very long time, interacting, talking about future dates, talking [about] going out for Valentine’s dinner with a friend. There’s all sorts of future plans.”Russell, a former Queenslander who was Cairns hospital’s director of sexual health, said he had already been contacted by several parents with children in a similar position to Liam.“I’m sure other doctors around the country are already receiving inquiries. So yep, we certainly expect to get [a] bit busier as a result of [theQueenslandban],” he said.Being able to provide medical care that would otherwise be denied is “reassuring to a young person and to their family, and that’s what we’re aiming to do in this situation”, Russell said.Some of Queensland’s private clinics were at capacity and had closed their books even before the state government announced thehealth service directivebanning public clinics from prescribing stage 1 and 2 treatment to children with gender dysphoria while anindependent reviewinto their use is conducted.Google Maps changed the way we get around. It all began in a spare bedroom in SydneyRead moreThere are about 491 children on the waiting list at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s hospital’s gender clinic, which can now not prescribe puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones.Access to psychiatric and psychological support will remain available, and children on a treatment plan involvingblockers and hormones– nearly 600 – can still access the services. Doctors will still be able to prescribe puberty blockers to children to treat precocious puberty.Dr Fiona Bisshop said many had turned to her clinic, Holdsworth House, for care. It had closed its books before the ban but staff decided to work overtime to increase capacity.She said children were often desperate and the ban had increased concern.“I’ve seen a number of young kids come in who are patients of mine already, who are sobbing, terrified, just couldn’t stop saying, ‘Will I, will I be able to access treatment?’ or ‘Will I have to stop my treatment?’” she said.“And the other people we’ve been fielding calls from are people who aren’t our patients, who are desperate to find somewhere to help them.”Bisshop said there were relatively few clinicians who provided the treatments, particularly in regional parts of the state.The Australian Professional Association for Trans Health (AusPATH) list of providers includes just 10 general practitioners in the entire state, withonly two outside Brisbane.

But then a stranger, only known to Colville as Phoebe, pulled over, picked her stranded daughter up and drove her home.“How many hundreds of vehicles were on that road for the three kilometres she was walking … how many cars actually drove past and thought, ‘That’s weird, well, I’ll keep driving,’” Colville said.If drivers are concerned that someone is lost, a good strategy is to stop and ask if the person is OK, and even better to stay with them and call police.Still, Colville was very grateful her daughter was home – but she was in a bind.“I didn’t have any way of contacting Phoebe to say thank you,” she said.Instead, she posted an account of what had happened to aFacebookpage called the Kindness Pandemic, with the “hope the universe made it right with Phoebe”.“It’s comforting to know that the world is filled with humans who, when they see something not quite right or a person who might need help, step up,” she says..The Facebook page, created in 2020 at the start of the pandemic, now has more than 520,000 members who continue to share stories of kindness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She recalls the stockpiling of toilet paper and a story of a supermarket cashier who had bruises up their arms.At its peak, Barrett says she was told by Facebook that Kindness Pandemic was the fastest-growing group in the world, sometimes gaining 50,000 new members a day. It grew so quickly the page glitched out, she says, prompting Facebook to assist.“People came to our group because they were frightened and they needed each other, and we still do now.”Melissa Williams, who helps manage the page, says the power of social connectedness and its value to people is clear. “It’s more important now than ever,” she says.“If lockdown taught us anything, it’s how many people are experiencing social isolation and the detrimental effects that can have.”Williams runs the non-profit charity Positive Attitude Inc, formed to support men with HIV in the 1980s whose friends were “dying all around them” and who “didn’t know how long they had”.Now, the charity coordinates free weekly lunches, with about 20 regular attenders, and a Christmas lunch. Those who come are mostly older long-term HIV survivors and for many it’s a rare social outing, she says.“We’re like a family, their chosen family … they know we’re a safe space for them, and they’ll always get any support they need.”Another story shared in the Kindness Pandemic group is of a stranger mailing Sandy Roswell her lost wallet – with everything still in it.It reminded Roswell there are “still honest and kind people out there”.The wallet was mailed a few months after it was lost, by which point Rowsell had accepted it was gone.“It was a godsend, I couldn’t believe it.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaFacebooknewsShareReuse this content"

With a federal election fast approaching, we should be seeing bold commitments from all political parties to achieve this.”Explore more on these topicsHealthMedicare AustraliaAustralian politicsDoctorsMark ButlernewsShareReuse this content"

But voters doubt he’ll be able to do what he says [on immigration] and so the only way to really show they want change is to vote for us.”Merz’s centre-right CDU/CSU alliance is hotly tipped to come first in the 23 February election with about 30% support, while the anti-migrant, anti-Islam AfD has held second place for months in the polls at just over 20%.Merz’s dramatic ploy to court far-right support in parliament for his “uncompromising” migration policies has failed to lure back AfD voters, opinion surveys suggest, with only negligible movement in support.Meanwhile, his characteristically impulsive stunt has shifted debate away from what polls say is Merz’s strongest selling point: theparlous state of the German economy. At the same time, his mercurial tactics appear to be stoking doubts about how he would govern.View image in fullscreenYoung supporters of CDU leader Friedrich Merz gather in the town of Sankt Ingbert in Saarland, southern Germany.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAGerman voters across the spectrum said last week that the turbulent campaign has left them deeply sceptical over whether the political centre is capable of forming alliances to address their concerns, with the AfD ready to pounce if things fall apart.Weekly news magazineDer Spiegelheadlined its latest cover story: “After the taboo breach: isGermanystill governable?” A YouGov poll showed four out of five Germans worry about what Merz’s muddier stance on the AfD will mean for future coalition talks among the mainstream parties.Lunchtime approached in Schkeuditz, a town near Leipzig airport, where many work at the giant DHL air cargo hub. Local people picking up a bratwurst at the grill van on the neat market square stopped to chat with Bochmann and his campaign volunteers, who handed out anti-theft credit card sleeves emblazoned with the blue AfD logo featuring an eye-catching red swoosh. It was the only party present.Bernd Ullrich, 72, said he had long voted for the CDU (Christian Democrats), Merz’s party, after the Berlin Wall fell but turned to the AfD for its anti-immigrant stance.“After reunification, we were proud of what we had achieved but now things are heading south and it’s all a result of [Angela] Merkel’s migration,” he said, referring to the former CDU chancellor’s decision a decade ago to leave the border open tomore than 1 million people fleeing war and poverty. Merz has also blamed that policy for fuelling the AfD’s rise.Assuming he wins, Merz would almost inevitably require a party to the CDU’s left – the Social Democrats or the Greens – to form a viable majority, Ullrich noted. Because Merz has ruled out a formal coalition with the AfD, that would require compromise on his pledges to curb migration by, for example, turning “irregular immigrants” back at the border.“Merz talks a good game [on immigration] but when the election is over, he’ll govern with red or green and have to backtrack,” Ullrich said, referring to the centre-left parties’ colours. “That’s election fraud.”Grit E, a 50-year-old Green voter, said she had been shocked to hear many longtime friends and neighbours in recent years give up on democratic parties, and worried that her teenage daughter’s outspoken opposition to the far right could get her into trouble in town. She fears Merz would not keep his word to bar the AfD from government.“It’s all been so chaotic and confusing,” she said of Merz’s AfD overtures. “He’s slammed his foot on the gas but is racing in the wrong direction. The way things are going is scary.”German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s unpopular “traffic light” coalitioncollapsed in November, triggering early elections seven months ahead of schedule. Merz, who has never run a ministry or one of Germany’s 16 regional states, has long looked well placed to realise adecades-old dream of becoming chancellor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the decision by Merz to chisel away at the“firewall” between centrists and the far righthas left many Germans angry, disoriented and fearful as they prepare to cast their ballots in two weeks’ time.View image in fullscreenThousands marched in Berlin last weekend in protest at CDU leader and German chancellorship candidate Friedrich Merz’s plans to limit migration.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersReligious leaders, human rights groups andMerkel herselfhave condemned Merz’s strategy as “wrong”, whiletens of thousands have joined protestsagainst the conservative candidate’s flirtation with the AfD.In the small town of Teltow in Brandenburg state, about 200 protesters rallied outside an AfD gathering one evening last week after hanging a “refugees welcome” banner above the main square.Several voters recalled that the turbulent political conditions of the Weimar era a century ago had allowed the Nazis to steamroll moderate forces. Casandra Hölscher, 32, an elementary school teacher, called the last week “emotional” for many Germans and said she worried that Merz was playing with fire and had no clear plan of how to protect democracy.“He has made it incredibly difficult for the SPD [Social Democratic party] or the Greens to say they will work with him – that’s what scares me,” she said. “Merz has manoeuvred his CDU into a difficult situation, and with it, us as a society.”Compared with many of its neighbours, Germany’s far right has taken much longer to reach critical mass. Numerous analysts put that down in part to the country’sculture of Holocaust remembrance,which has kept the Nazi horrors alive in the public consciousness.Kerstin, 50, who declined to give her surname because she has a doctor’s surgery in town, said it sickened her to see asylum seekers used as political scapegoats and she worried that a broadly shared understanding of the limits of political discourse was crumbling. “The refugees aren’t the problem but rather our approach to them. Many of them have experienced war and don’t get the care they need in Germany – not medically and, above all, not psychologically, which we’ve seen in these attacks,” she said.“You saw the same thing after the second world war, where soldiers who returned made the same kind of trouble. I spend a lot of time studying the Nazi period and the moment things reached the point of no return. I’m afraid now that things could get very radical.”Christoph Noack, 58, a religious studies teacher, said he took Merz at his word when he ruled out formally cooperating with the AfD and encouraged the candidate to draw lessons from a “mistake that backfired”.“Now it’s my hope that the established parties can band together and form a front against racism and incitement,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGermanyThe ObserverRefugeesAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)EuropeThe far rightAngela MerkelEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

However, delays in bringing the case before a jury have allowed his lawyers to successfully argue for bail.The delays were condemned by Caruana Galizia’s family, who claimed the state and the justice system were “failing the victims”.Fenech and his family have pledged over €50m in cash and shares as security for his release.View image in fullscreenRelatives of Daphne Caruana Galizia take part in a protest march in Valletta, Malta, in 2023 on the sixth anniversary of her assassination.Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/ReutersCaruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb which was detonated as she was leaving her home in Bidnija, Malta. The case embroiled the governing party in scandal and accusations of a cover-up, while the spectacle of a violent assassination within an EU member state raised concerns over attacks on journalists withinEurope.Fenech walked out of Corradino Correctional Facility on Thursday evening, five years after he was first charged. In a navy zip-up jumper and jeans, clutching paperwork and accompanied by his defence lawyer, Fenech climbed into a van with blacked-out windows as film crews pressed towards him. He declined to comment, saying only “thank you” before the van moved away.Fenech is one of seven men who have either admitted to or been charged in connection with the killing. He denies the charges and is pleading not guilty.To date, none of the accused have been put on trial. Two brotherspleaded guilty to planting the bomband were sentenced to 40 years in prison. Their accomplice was given a reduced sentence after admitting his guilt and providing evidence for the prosecution. Two of the men accused of supplying the bomb are in custody awaiting trial.Melvin Theuma, a taxi driver who claims he acted as middleman, secured a presidential pardonin exchange for giving evidenceand is living under police protection.TheDaphne Caruana GaliziaFoundation, set up by her family, said after Fenech’s release: “The bomb blast that killed her was a warning: the justice system is failing the victims.”“While no one can be kept in prison without trial indefinitely, trials could and should be completed before bail becomes a concern. Defendants, prosecutors, and the courts should not be allowed to extend proceedings for years.”Judge Edwina Grima originally agreed to bail on Friday 24 January, but negotiations over the complex arrangements for the financial guarantees took two weeks to complete, delaying Fenech’s release.His aunt has pledged her shares in the family’s property business, Tumas Group, as collateral. The stake was reportedly valued at over €50m (£42m). Fenech has also paid an €80,000 (£67,000) deposit and is bound by a €120,000 guarantee, both of which will be forfeited should he breach his bail conditions.He is barred from going within 50 metres of the coast or airport, and from contacting witnesses in the case against him, including Theuma.He will have to sign a bail book at a police station every day and stay indoors between 5pm and 11am. He must only live at an address agreed with the court, and a police officer will be stationed outside his nominated residence 24 hours a day.Fenech’s passport and identification documents will be held by the court.The delays in bringing a trial have been criticised by Roberta Metsola, the president of the European parliament and an MEP forMalta, who wrote in a post on Facebook: “A system that forces those accused of the most heinous crimes to be allowed out of jail on bail because their trial by jury took more than half a decade to get under way, is a system that is broken. It is a system that cannot deliver justice.”The attorney general, who is leading the prosecution, argued against the release, citing flight risk and the possibility of witness interference. However, Maltese law allows defendants to leave prison if a 30-month period elapses without trial after their initial bill of indictment.Malta’s prime minister, Robert Abela, said he understood the family’s pain but rejected suggestions the government could have done more. Speaking last weekend he said the delay was due to constitutional cases and preliminary hearings brought by Fenech, and requests from the prosecution and family, such as anonymity for Caruana Galizia’s sources.“If you ask me whether the government could have done anything differently in this case, I would say it couldn’t,” Abela said.View image in fullscreenDaphne Caruana Galizia outside the Libyan embassy in Malta in 2011.Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/ReutersA newspaper columnist and magazine publisher whose political blog was widely read, Caruana Galizia was almost as well known in her home country as those she exposed in her scoops. She took aim at Malta’s then Labour prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and his ministers in her reporting.The journalist was associated closely with the opposition Nationalist party, and the struggle to bring her killers to justice has been hamstrung by political conflict.Muscat wasforced to resign in 2019amid the crisis.

The couple had moved to south-west France from Scotland about 10 years ago.Scottish-born actor Callum Kerr, 30, who played PC George Kiss in the Channel 4 soap, shared a statement on Instagram. It said: “At this time, Callum Kerr, Amanda Kerr, Tom Searle & Ella Searle are grieving the tragic loss of their mother and father, Dawn and Andrew Searle. No family member is available for media interviews or comments.“We kindly request that their privacy be respected during this difficult period. We will provide updates as appropriate.”Kerr has appeared in Netflix’s Virgin River and has released a number of country songs.Kerr walked his mother down the aisle when she married Searle at a ceremony in France. On social media, he said: “Not many people can say they walked their own mother down the aisle. What a pleasure. I love you, mum.”According to local media, Dawn was found outside the property with a serious head injury and jewellery around her. She was reportedly found by a neighbour, who thought she was unconscious and called emergency services.When police, accompanied by a helicopter, a drone, criminal investigation technicians and a forensic doctor, arrived at the property, they discovered Andrew Searle dead. Police say they have reached no conclusion and are keeping an open mind about the deaths.“Both died violent deaths, but I cannot establish that either was a homicide. All hypotheses remain open,” the public prosecutor, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said on Friday. Rigot-Muller told the BBC autopsies will begin on Monday.A spokesperson for the UK’s Foreign Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British couple who died in France and are liaising with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The change in 2023 allowed her to claim some backdated payments but excluded the period between October 2016 and August 2018, which Leigh Day said had cost the family £16,000.Byles lost his partner in 2017 after a cancer diagnosis 10 years earlier and was also unable to claim for the full period, with his family missing out on £14,000 as a result, the law firm said. The figures are based on the widowed parent’s allowance they would have received.Leigh Day said the pair wanted to highlight the harm caused by the cutoff date for eligibility and secure equal treatment for all bereaved children and parents.Gunnooa said: “My son has been a victim of discrimination simply because his parents weren’t married.“This money would have helped us navigate the financial challenges after my partner’s death. Instead, I’ve faced years of stress trying to make ends meet, all while grieving and raising my son, who has special needs. We cannot let this unfairness continue.”Byles said by the time of his partner’s death the family’s financial position had become very difficult.“I had to return to work almost immediately but was only able to get part-time work, as I needed to be free for school runs and also to be around to support my children through that very hard time. I had to take on debt so that I could continue providing for my family, which was very stressful,” he said.The court will now consider whether to admit the claim.Explore more on these topicsBenefitsConsumer affairsEuropean court of human rightsEuropeHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet she foresaw a dark and violent future forEuropeand gave voice to those fears in a 1934 novel that is now being hailed as “an electrifying masterpiece”.Carson’s book,Crooked Cross, predicted the scale of the Nazi threat and is to berepublished for the first time this spring, ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war. Controversial in its day, her novel had to tread a careful path to avoid the accusation that it was alarmist about the Führer’s aims. A stage adaptation was even censored, shorn of all its “Heil Hitlers”.The novel tells the story of a German family struggling in an uncertain economy, but looking forward to the marriage of their daughter, Alexa, to a young doctor – that is, until his Jewish background jeopardises their engagement.Taking its title from the shape of the swastika,Crooked Crosswas immediately recognised as essential reading and widely praised, including in the pages of theObserverof July 1934, where Gerald Gould judged it “a very good novel” that avoids any “propagandist tendency” by letting “the story stand on its merits”. Reading the manuscript last year, the contemporary author Rachel Joyce described it as an “electrifying masterpiece”.View image in fullscreenSylvia ‘Sally’ Carson often went to stay in Bavaria with friends in the 1930s. It was first in Germany and then back in England that she wrote the trilogy of novels that started with Crooked Cross.Photograph: PersephoneDespite its involving depiction of pre-warGermany, where Carson had spent time,Crooked Crosshad been consigned to the cultural archives. Then it was rediscovered by the biographer and founder of Persephone Books, Nicola Beauman.“Once she’d tracked down a rare remaining copy she was struck that such an extraordinary and important novel could have been lost to history,” a spokesperson for the publisher said this weekend. “To have the ­opportunity to rescue this literary masterpiece from being entirely lost is an immense privilege. As the lessons history has taught us seem worryingly close to being forgotten, now feels like the right time to share it with the world.”The novel opens on Christmas Eve in 1932 and charts the growing disaffection of a group of German young pople who feel lost and ignored, and so turn towards a new authoritarian leader. On the back of its critical success, the book was quickly turned into a stage play and performed first in Birmingham and then in London.A 1937 West End production was hailed by the theatre critic of theNew York Timesas the “tragedy of a Bavarian girl’s love for a Jewish doctor in the early days of the Nazi revolution” that captivated “without indulging in propaganda and without bias”.TheTimesalso praised Carson’s approach: “The real strength of the play lies in the nature of its criticism of its subject … Through it all she never preaches, or loses touch, through hate or prejudice, with the human beings she represents.“She has a point of view, but she is an artist, not a tub-thumper, with the consequence that all her people live and her truth is spoken in their nature and their suffering.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It called for every “Heil Hitler” to be cut from the script. Even in this censored form, the play went on to draw protest from rightwing factions in Britain, who viewed it as anti-German propaganda and argued it was too negative about the Nazi government.Persephone Bookswill now mount its own revival of the play, with a fully cast, professional public reading of the script in April to be held above its bookshop in Bath. It will be the first time audiences have heard the dramatisation since the curtain came down on the original London production.Sylvia “Sally” Carson was the youngest of three sisters brought up by a widowed mother in Dorset. As a young woman she taught dance, while also working as a publisher’s reader and spending her holidays in Bavaria with friends.She started writing the novel there, completing it in England and then penning two sequels,The Prisoner(1936) andA Traveller Came By(1938). She married the Bradford publisher Eric Humphries and had three children in three years – a twin son and daughter, and then another daughter. Carson died of breast cancer aged just 39 in June 1941, as the violence she had foreseen raged across Europe.Explore more on these topicsNazismThe ObserverPublishingSecond world warGermanyEuropeAdolf HitlernewsShareReuse this content"

I’m sure he will now receive the right treatment and he will get stronger … he has an amazing family, and we will all be there for him.”The handover included statements from the three on stage, in which they stated support for finalising the next phases of the Israel-Hamas truce.1:09Israeli hostages reunited with families after release – videoThe “disturbing images” from Gaza show that “we must get them all out”, said theHostages and Missing Families Forumcampaign group.The office of the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, whose dejected-looking portrait appeared on a banner at the Deir al-Balah handover site, said the images out of Gaza were “shocking”.Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, denounced the treatment of the hostages, who were paraded on stage “after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained” and “exploited in a cynical and cruel spectacle”.Sharabi, 52, and Ben Ami, a 56-year-old dual German citizen, were abducted from their homes in kibbutz Be’eri when militants stormed the small community near the Gaza border.Sharabi lost his wife and two daughters in the attack. Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival, where gunmen murdered his wife.In the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority, relatives and supporters gathered to welcome inmates released by Israel, embracing them and cheering as they stepped off the bus that brought them from nearby Ofer prison.Israel’s prison service said that “183 terrorists … were released” to the West Bank, annexed east Jerusalem and Gaza.The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club and the Palestinian Red Crescent said seven of them had been admitted to hospital in the West Bank.“All the prisoners who were released today are in need of medical care … as a result of the brutality they were subjected” to in jail, said the advocacy group, which has long complained of alleged abuses of Palestinians in Israeli custody.In a statement, Hamas accused Israel of “systematic assaults and mistreatment of our prisoners”, calling it “part of the policy of … the slow killing of prisoners”.Gaza militants have so far freed 21 hostages in exchange for hundreds of mostly Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails.Five Thai hostages freed last weekfrom Gaza were discharged on Saturday from a hospital in central Israel, where they had been treated since their release, and were headed back to their home country.The ceasefire, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the US, aims to secure the release of 12 more hostages during its first 42-day phase.Negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire were due to begin on Monday, but there have been no details on the status of the talks.Netanyahu’s office said that after Saturday’s swap, an Israeli delegation would head to Doha for further talks.Hama’s October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.Israel’s retaliation has killed at least 48,181 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry. The United Nations considers the figures reliable.Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesGazaMiddle East peace talksBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, was recently named president, but his forces are still declared a terrorist group by the UK and other countries.At least 6,600 Syrian asylum applications, each of which can include more than one person, are frozen in the UK system pending an initial decision and more claims are expected from those arriving on small boats, according to analysis by theObserverof official figures. Leading charities and lawyers have called for the government to resolve the situation.View image in fullscreenSyria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, at a press conference in Ankara on 4 February after talks with the Turkish president.Photograph: Ozan Köse/AFP/Getty ImagesMany of the claims that have been put on hold are thought to be from Syrians who fled Assad’s regime. In the House of Lords last month, the Home Office minister, Lord Hanson, said there was a “strong case” that the majority of Syrians who arrived before the fall of Assad “were fleeing the Assad regime”.However, several different groups have been accused of persecution and war crimes, and have controlled different territories since the outbreak of civil war in Syria in 2011.Hassan*, a former colonel in the Syrian Arab Army who defected and believes he remains at risk from people on all sides of the conflict, is among those affected.Hassan arrived in Britain on a small boat about two years ago and was granted asylum last year before the decision was withdrawn by the Home Office because of a spelling mistake. It was not corrected and reissued before the Assad regime fell and the pause on claims took effect.“People who arrived months after me have got residency and the right to reunite with their families, but I am still waiting,” Hassan said.“My wife and children are living in Turkey. I have not seen them for years and they are waiting for me to find them a safe country, a new life and a better future.”Hassan called the pause on decisions “arbitrary”, saying that al-Sharaa’s rebel faction remained a designated terrorist group and should not be recognised as a “legitimate authority ruling Syria”.He said that while he knew some Syrians who were planning to return to the country following the regime change, as a former colonel in Assad’s army, he fears being arrested and killed. “Me and my family, we do not have any possibility of returning to Syria,” he added.“I was never a supporter of the former regime and I lost everything, but I do not accept living in a country ruled by extremists and knowing that my fate will be death.”Al-Sharaa, who was named president for what state media called a “transitional period” on 29 January, has vowed to pursue people he called “criminals who shed Syrian blood”.While committing to holding elections and drawing up a new constitution, he has suggested to local media that the process could take years.A Home Office official, speaking on condition of anonymity, accused the British government of “putting people’s lives on hold for political reasons” amid internal indecision about how to treat Al-Sharaa’s new regime.“They are basically holding asylum applicants captive until the Foreign Office figures out what the international stance is,” they added. “It’s not needed, as they could grant asylum and then revoke it once they ascertain that the refugee no longer runs the risk of being persecuted in their home country.”The civil servant said that because those now in limbo cannot legally work, and the government has a legal duty to house and support them until a decision is made, the pause was driving up accommodation costs. It cannot lift the freeze until new guidance is drawn up for asylum applications. But the Home Office website shows all documents related to Syria as “withdrawn”.Hanson confirmed last month, answering questions in the House of Lords, that asylum interviews had been paused and that a timeline had not been set for resuming processing.“This was and remains a necessary step which several other European countries have also taken,” Hanson added. “The pause is under constant review. When there is a clear basis on which to make decisions, we will resume.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a very complex, moving situation.”The Refugee Council is urging the government to find an alternative way of processing claims, such as focusing on claims that are not reliant on persecution by the Assad regime or granting a form of humanitarian protection. Jon Featonby, the charity’s chief policy analyst, said the ongoing “limbo” was distressing for those affected and costly for the system.“We recognise that the situation has changed quite significantly but many people have already been stuck in the asylum system for a long time, and are now caught up in this uncertainty,” he added. “There doesn’t seem to be any clarity on how long the pause will be for. We recognise the Home Office needs to take a bit of time to ascertain what’s going on, but it could be some time before they get any clarity. It’s in everybody’s best interest for there to be a way of moving forward quite quickly.”Featonby said that Syrian refugees with existing rights, but who are approaching deadlines to apply for indefinite leave to remain, face “serious ramifications” because if their legal right to remain expires, they will lose eligibility for housing, employment and study.“It is understandably starting to cause worry and disrupt their lives, even if they’ve been in the UK for years and started to rebuild their lives,” Featonby added. “It doesn’t seem realistic that the situation in Syria is going to resolve itself any time soon and leaving people in limbo isn’t in anybody’s best interests.”Steve Smith, the chief executive of the Care4Calais charity, also called for the UK government to lift the pause. “The decision to pause the asylum claims of Syrian refugees is essentially an admission from the government that they cannot guarantee Syria is safe under the new political regime,” he said.“Those locked in limbo as a result of the pause sought safety in the UK and many have waited years for a decision on their asylum claim. We have a moral obligation to give them a decision so they can start to rebuild their lives.”Hassan voiced concern that the current fragile peace could give way to fresh conflict between the competing groups who still control different parts of Syria.“There is the possibility of escalation and civil war at any time, and the presence of many sleeper cells and extremist groups that are still carrying out attacks in different areas,” he said. “The path towards comprehensive security and stability will take a long time, and there need to be exceptions to the suspension of asylum decisions for Syrians.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Home Office has temporarily paused decisions on Syrian asylum claims while we assess the current situation. We are committed to delivering an asylum system that is responsive to all forms of persecution and which facilitates fair and sustainable asylum decisions.”* The name has been changed to protect anonymityExplore more on these topicsRefugeesThe ObserverHome OfficeSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Not far away, entire blocks have been reduced to rubble, but here, in this small corner of the city in the southernGazaStrip, the damage is less extensive. Raed al-Sawafiri, the owner and manager, stands in front of chicken rotating on a grill and smiles. Every one of his plastic tables is occupied.Al-Sawafiri had no experience of the restaurant trade until very recently. Displaced 10 times during the 16-month conflict in Gaza, the 23-year-old opened his first establishment in Rafah, the southernmost city in the territory, early this year, after sourcing old equipment and sending his father to the border with Egypt to buy meat.“The response from people was amazing, but we had to flee the [Israeli] attack on Rafah and move to the coast. Finally, I decided to try again in Khan Younis and, thanks be to God, we have had success,” he said.The restaurant is one of thousands of small businesses created during the war by desperate residents seeking to survive economically. Planners now hope such initiatives will help drive reconstruction efforts – if the ceasefire holds and Donald Trumprevises his planfor the US to “own” the territory, displace its population of more than 2 million and transform it from a “demolition site” into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.Al-Sawafiri risked death or injury to furnish his restaurant, scouring Gaza despite the Israeli offensive, which has reduced much of the territory to shattered ruins.“Sometimes, I had to walk long distances to fetch water, and at times, I would search in areas like Deir al-Balah and Rafah and buy the necessary equipment at any cost, and it was hard to find skilled chefs and quality spices, but I did not give up,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe al-Sawafiri restaurant in Khan Younis.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianOnly a handful of such establishments exist but their popularity is a testament to the resolve of Palestinians in Gaza, observers say, where more than 90% of homes have been damaged or destroyed, along with almost all basic infrastructure.Projections from 2024 estimate that justclearing Gaza’s rubble, which is contaminated by toxic chemicals and unexploded bombs, would take a fleet of 100 lorries 15 years.Yet many in Gaza say they are determined to rebuild, posting videoson social mediaof efforts to clear their homes of rubble, orpizza vansworking their way through the ruins.“They are heroes,” said Yara Salem, a former World Bank executive based in Ramallah who has worked with communities in Gaza on a new redevelopment plan. “It is superhuman, their ability to live and relive. We have this in our blood. We are not going to live on handouts in a refugee camp. I am a Palestinian and I have never seen such resilience like I see in Gaza.”In Khan Younis on Thursday evening, families sat down to share dinner in restaurants such as al-Sawafiri’s – some for the first time since the beginning of the conflict in October 2023.Nivin Qadeh, 38, said: “The last time we went out was three days before the war started. The whole family went out on a trip before the school year began for our children.“We used to go out often, and could give our children whatever they asked for. But now we have lost our house and all our savings, so it is very difficult. For this one evening, we can forget our troubles.”Qadeh’s family was displaced from their home east of Deir al-Balah at the start of the Israeli offensive, which has killed at least 47,000 people, mostly civilians. The war was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas into Israel that killed 1,200 people, also mostly civilians, with 250 taken hostage.Qadeh said: “There are still fears of the war returning because the ceasefire is conditional and not permanent. I am very afraid that … the war will return as before. What will happen next is unknown, but we make the most of every minute during the ceasefire to feel a little psychological stability and have life return to normal, even if just a little.”Despite the efforts of aid agencies, food in Gaza remains scarce. While some prices fell between December 2024 and January 2025, many basics are up to 12 times more expensive than before the war. And though a third of households surveyed reported improved access to food, according to the UN, many are still eating little more than bread and tinned vegetables. The most recent statistics revealmore than 1 million people are facing “emergency levels of food insecurity”or worse.Fuel is also a major problem, with no electricity and very little gas. For months, waste plastic and wood have been used for cooking, but these are scarce now, too.View image in fullscreenFahd al-Af, the owner of Fahd’s in Khan Younis.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThose with regular incomes can afford the occasional meal from a restaurant. Sihaam Abu Ghmeil, 29, who works for an international NGO, said he had come to the Fahd restaurant in Khan Younis to buy lunch for his family.“This was always one of my favourite restaurants. The last time I came was before the war, on the Thursday night just before the war began. We went out as a family, had dinner outside, and some sweets, and stayed until late at night. That was the last family outing,” Abu Ghmeil said.“I will delete all memories of the war from my mind completely. In the future, I do not want to remember anything from this time. I only want to hold on to the happy and beautiful memories of Gaza before the war, for fear that those days may not return.”Nearby, Ahmed Hamad, a 19-year-old from Beit Hanoun who was a member of a traditional dance company before the war, was enjoying a shawarma kebab.He said: “Now, we feel some relief thanks to the ceasefire, and we walk the streets feeling more at ease. We are now able to go out to enjoy shawarma or sit in cafes, which is really important because we need to find ways to release our emotions after such a long period of tension.”On the night before the war, Hamad was performing in a restaurant in the Jabaliya camp, now reduced to ruins. “The atmosphere was very nice during those days, and I can’t forget them. When I remember those moments, I feel deep sadness,” he said.He is not among those planning to rebuild Gaza, and is hoping for a life elsewhere: “I will be one of the first to leave when the crossing opens for travellers, because the situation here has become unsafe, and I prefer to go to a safer place.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

I felt sick in the stomach. It’s a band you’ll never experience or see again and it’s been on my bucket list for years. It just feels like my dreams have been completely crushed.”She said each ticket cost about £150 while a hotel stay cost £200 a person and a further £40 for travel.Marta Bonnet, a fan from Spain, said she spent more than £3,000 for herself, her husband and two teenage children to see Oasis at Wembley and received the same email on Friday.She initially thought the email was fake, but after realising it was from Ticketmaster she said she does not intend to buy tickets from the company in the future, despite being a loyal customer.Bonnet, 48, a lawyer from Tenerife, said: “At first we thought this email was fake or a spam email, but no, it was true.“We usually use Ticketmaster to buy our tickets … But now, how can I trust this page, which is supposed to be the official page? I really can’t believe what has happened.”Bonnet managed to buy four premium tickets for just more than £1,000 last August and spent about £2,082 (€2,000) on accommodation and flights, but said it is unlikely she will be refunded for her plane tickets.A spokesperson from Ticketmaster said: “Anyone who has been contacted and believes a refund was made in error has been sent a form to fill in for the tour’s promoters to review.”The Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigationinto Ticketmaster in September regarding the sale of Oasis tickets, including so-called dynamic pricing.Ticketmaster said at the time it does not set concert prices and its website states this is down to the “event organiser” who “has priced these tickets according to their market value”.PA Media contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsTicketmasterOasisnewsShareReuse this content"

The site could soon be turned into a Chinese embassy.China bought the site and has proposed turning the two hectares (five acres) of land into the largest embassy in Europe.Tower Hamlets councilrefused planning permissionin 2022, citing a range of concerns including the impact of large protests at the site. The Conservative governmentdeclined to intervene.Beijing resubmitted the application after Labour came to power and the government called it in after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, raised it directly with Keir Starmer. Cabinet ministersYvette Cooper and David Lammy have signalled their support for the proposaland a local inquiry hearing will begin next week.View image in fullscreenProtesters against the proposal for a Chinese super-embassy.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverThe final decision rests with Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary.Those protesting, including many people from Hong Kong who have sought refuge in the UK, expressed concerns that the embassy could be used to “control” and illegally detain dissenters.Tai, 50, a carer, said: “We come from Hong Kong. We are afraid that China will use this place to look over us, against us. In Hong Kong, we have many experience of China, the CPP, controlling the freedom and democracy and against the Hong Kong people. We all face this.”He expressed concerns that the embassy could be used by the Chinese government “to control the Hong Kong people who live in the UK”, adding that: “People leave Hong Kong because they are afraid of the CPP.”Another protester, who gave her name as Mitochondria, 20, expressed similar concerns. “It’s very possible that this building could be used for holding Chinese dissidents who are on British soil to be arrested in a non-legal way,” she said. “A mega-embassy would enable that to happen.”View image in fullscreen‘Mitochondria’ said a mega-embassy could be used for ‘non-legal’ arrests of Chinese dissidents.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverShe held a blue and white Uyghur flag. “The Chinese government has imperialist interest where they occupy the land of East Turkestan,” she said.“There’s a genocide ongoing of the Uyghur people, the Muslim people in East Turkestan. They shouldn’t be oppressed. This is why I am holding the flag because we are in the same fight against the same authoritarian government.”About halfway through the demonstration, officers dragged a woman to a police van. A large group of protesters dressed in black surrounded the van in an attempt to block it from leaving, shouting “let her go”.Another woman appeared to have become unwell and was seen lying on the rain-covered road.Fred, 29, an engineer, expressed concerns the building could be used “to catch people inside the embassy and do espionage”.“We are the beacon of freedom in the world. It’s a shame to see this beautiful compound, our legacy, our pride, fall into a dictator’s hands.”View image in fullscreenProtesters at the Royal Mint Court, site of the former headquarters of the UK’s coin maker.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverA number of high-profile politicians including Iain Duncan Smith, Tom Tugendhat andLabourMP Blair McDougall also spoke to protesters. Tugendhat, the former security minister, said allowing the embassy to go ahead would be a “grave mistake”.“It would be a very clear statement that our government had chosen the wrong side and not the side that was for the defence and protection of the British people and our economic future.”He said letting the plans go ahead would send a message to the world that the British government “hasn’t learned the lessons of the last decade” and “just hasn’t been listening”.Tugendhat told reporters: “The reality is some people made decisions in 2010, 2013, you can understand at the time. You can see the hopefulness and the optimism with which they approached it.“To have that same optimism in 2025? It’s not optimism any more, that’s just a wilful ignorance.”Explore more on these topicsLondonChinaUyghursPlanning policyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The Liberal Democrats are on 11% and the Greens 8%. Reform has risen from about 20% in Opinium’s polling shortly after the general election, while the other two main parties have fallen back.Among those who are backing Reform, the poll found that 37% say they do so because of its hardline policies on immigration and border controls.Separately, among people who are “Reform considerers” (thinking about backing the party), about 72% said they were doing so because of the party’s immigration and borders policies. This is more than twice the percentage cited for any other policy issue. Roughly 36% cited Reform UK’s anti-EU stance as the main reason for considering backing the party.At last summer’s general election two of Reform UK’s five main policy pledges were to do with migration. It said it would freeze non-essential immigration, with exceptions only for essential healthcare workers.On the issue of small boats smuggling migrants across the Channel, the party said it would “pick up illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France”, and added that “zero illegal migrants” would be resettled in the UK.The poll also shows disastrous falls in Keir Starmer’s personal ratings since the general election. His rating for being “in touch with ordinary people” has fallen from +4% in June last year to -34%. His rating for “representing what ordinary people think” has plummeted from +1% to -39%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Somebody’s stabbed the kids.’“I said: ‘What do you mean?’“She went: ‘It’s really bad. You need to get here.’“I just ran. I left the whole house open and got in the car.”Stancombe added: “It’s a five-minute drive from ours and we must have got there in a minute. We kept our hands on the horn, going faster and faster, jumping every red light on the road, we were on the other side of the road, people throwing their hands up to us.“I just didn’t care, I just kept whacking the horn. We got there and just deserted the car in the middle of the road and just ran.“And by that point police started trying to push people back.”Bebe King’s parents – who cannot be named for legal reasons – had been preparing for a wedding the following day.Her mother recalled being in Marks & Spencer when she received a phone call from her husband, who had arrived early to collect their daughter.She said: “I was about to put my card in the machine, and he called. ‘I can’t believe I’m telling you this but somebody has gone into the dance class with a knife.’She ran outside and jumped into a taxi. The driver dropped her off at the end of the street “and I just ran”.It emerged last month that Rudakubana, who was 17 at the time of the Southport attack,was referred three times to the Prevent programme.One of the referrals followed concerns about his potential interest in the killing of children in a school massacre, it is understood.Elsie’s uncle, Chris, told the newspaper: “The bottom line is the perpetrator was a child.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Notwithstanding some people are just born that way. But having access to such hateful information at their fingertips – from day one that’s what we said was a factor.”During sentencing, the court heard a summary of the prosecution’s evidence along with the judge’s sentencing remarks and details of the victims’ injuries which were broadcast live.Chris said: “The sentencing shouldn’t have been televised.”Bebe’s father added: “We know it has to be heard in court but why did the whole nation need to see it on television?”Bebe’s family did not attend court during the sentencing. “We didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of seeing us,” her father added.Both parents also paid tribute to their daughters.Stancombe said it was an honour to be Elsie’s mother“Everything she did was pure enthusiasm. It could be the most boring thing – even, like, David taking the bins out – and it was like: ‘I’ll come!’ She was grateful for life.”The Stancombes have set up a charity, called Elsie’s Story, to help children in need.King’s mother said of her daughter: “She would come out with the most random stuff. She would do it and look at you and laugh as if to say: ‘I’m dead funny, aren’t I?’ She would give you this hug and say: ‘I love you, momma.’“She was the best.”Explore more on these topicsSouthport attackChild protectionChildrenInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

They included apparent antisemitic remarks and demeaning comments about Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister.Gwynne, 50, is alleged to have made the comments in aWhatsAppmessaging group with other local party figures.Keir Starmer sacked Gwynne on Saturday after his party was presented with the messages by the Mail on Sunday.A government spokesperson said: “The prime minister is determined to uphold high standards of conduct in public office and lead a government in the service of working people. He will not hesitate to take action against any minister who fails to meet these standards, as he has in this case.”The Gorton and Denton MP’s alleged messages include one in which he joked that he hoped a 72-year-old woman would soon die after contacting her Labour councillor about her bins.“As you have been re-elected, I thought it would be an appropriate time to contact you with regard to the bin collections,” she wrote.When the letter from the resident was shared in the WhatsApp group, Gwynne wrote a suggested response: “Dear resident, fuck your bins. I’m re-elected and without your vote. Screw you. PS: Hopefully you’ll have croaked it by the all-outs.”His reference to “all-outs” refers to local council elections in which the whole local authority is up for election. In many cases, only a third of a council faces elections each year.Among the other messages, Gwynne is alleged to have said someone “sounds too Jewish” and “too militaristic” from their name. He also asked: “Is he in Mossad?”He is also said to have made comments about both Diane Abbott, the veteran Labour MP, and Rayner.In 2019 in the WhatsApp group, called Trigger Me Timbers, Gwynne is alleged to have said support for Abbott’s historic appearance as a black woman at prime minister’s questions was a “joke”, apparently adding that her appearance was “because it’s Black History Month apparently”.In March 2021, when Rayner faced criticism for claiming wireless headphones on parliamentary expenses, Gwynne reposted a tweet by a so-called parody account that referred to the incident and related it to a sex act.Gwynne said on Saturday evening: “I deeply regret my badly misjudged comments and apologise for any offence I’ve caused.“I entirely understand the decisions the PM and the party have taken and, while very sad to have been suspended, will support them in any way I can.”A Labour spokesperson said: “Andrew Gwynne has been administratively suspended as a member of the Labour party. We are investigating comments made in this WhatsApp group in line with the Labour party’s rules and procedures.“Swift action will be taken if individuals are found to have breached the high standards expected of them as Labour party members.”Explore more on these topicsLabourHealthWhatsAppnewsShareReuse this content"

This is a major reduction on what was previously allowed under the NIH grant system.“The United States should have the best medical research in the world,” the NIH said in astatementon Friday. “It is accordingly vital to ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead.”In the financial year of 2023, $9bn out of $35bn in awarded grants went to cover overheads, the NIH said, adding that the new rate will be more in line with requirements of private foundations.The move has been hailed by supporters of Trump’s attempts to slash government spending. The “department of government efficiency”, headed by billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk, welcomed the funding cut, tweeting that it was an “amazing job” by the NIH.However, researchers warned that the cut will imperil vital medical research. “This is a surefire way to cripple lifesaving research and innovation,” said Matt Owens, president of the Council on Government Relations, which represents universities and academic medical centers. “Reimbursement of facilities and administrative expenditures are part and parcel of the total costs of conducting world-class research.“America’s competitors will relish this self-inflicted wound. We urge NIH leaders to rescind this dangerous policy before its harms are felt by Americans.”Democrats also criticized the decision, which follows a broader freeze on some research grants imposed by the Trump administration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The same fights are re-emerging in the early days of Trump’s second term.“Californians are being threatened by an out-of-control administration that doesn’t care about the constitution and thinks there are no limits to its power,” said Democratic assembly speaker Robert Rivas, in a statement earlier this week. “That is why we are delivering legislation that will allocate resources to defend Californians from this urgent threat.”‘We don’t trust Trump’: California earmarks $50m to fight administrationRead moreThe move comes a day after the Democratic governor returned from Washington, where he met with Trump and members of Congress to try to secure federal disaster aid for the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires that ripped through neighborhoods in January, killing more than two dozen people.Newsom signed a $2.5bn package for fire relief into law last month to help fund the state’s disaster response including evacuations, sheltering survivors and removing household hazardous waste. His administration has said they expect the federal government to reimburse the state.Republican lawmakers have criticized the funding for lawsuits, saying the focus on Trump is distracting as the Los Angeles area recovers from the fires.“This slush fund isn’t about solving any real problems – it’s a political stunt designed to distract from the urgent issues our state faces and it won’t bode well for fire victims,” the Republican state senate minority leader Brian Jones said in a statement earlier this week.Critics have also said the legislation doesn’t ensure that funding wouldn’t be used to defend immigrants without legal status who have been convicted of serious felonies.After signing the funding into law, Newsom said the money wasn’t intended to be used for that purpose and he encouraged lawmakers to pass subsequent legislation if clarifying that is needed. He said in a statement that the funding will assist legal groups in “safeguarding the civil rights of California’s most vulnerable residents”.Newsom announced the plan to safeguard the state’s policies days after Trump’s election in November. He convened the legislature in a special session to pass the bills.The state is used to taking the federal government to court over Trump actions.California sued the Republican president’s administration more than 120 times during his first term, according to the attorney general’s office. The state spent about $42m overall on legal battles against the federal government, ranging from around $2m to nearly $13m a year.The headline on this article was amended on 8 February 2025 to clarify that California now has $50m both for legal battles against the federal government and for legal groups defending immigrants facing possible deportation, not solely for the latter.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaDonald TrumpGavin NewsomWest CoastUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

BACK TO PLASTIC!” The US president added in aseparate postthat Biden’s “mandate” for paper straws was now dead: “Enjoy your next drink without a straw that disgustingly dissolves in your mouth!!!”Trump appears to be taking aim at an effort by the Biden administration plan,unveiledlast year, to phase out all single-use plastics across the federal government by 2035. At the time, the White House said it was the first time it was “formally acknowledging the severity of the plastic pollution crisis and the scale of the response that will be required to effectively confront it”.Biden’s attempt to reduce throwaway plastics, such as straws and sachets, from the US government, which is one of the world’s largest single consumers of goods, was aimed at tackling a growing tide of plastic pollution. Other countries had already put bans in place – the European Union barred single-use plastic items such as plates, cutlery and straws, and will further extend this to plastic bags, toiletries and other items by 2030.But Trump, such a fan of drinking Diet Coke that he has installed abuttonin the Oval Office in order to summon staff to deliver the drink, has long railed against any restrictions upon plastic straws.Study finds microplastic contamination in 99% of seafood samplesRead moreWhen attempting to gain re-election in 2020, his campaignsoldreusable straws on its website claiming that “liberal paper straws don’t work”. On his first day back as president after returning to the White House in January, Trumprescindeda Biden order to phase out single-use plastics on federal lands, including US national parks, by 2032.The world is undergoing aglut of new plastic production, and a summit among countries last yearfailed to come to a deal to address thisdespite growing recognition of the harm caused by waste that takes hundreds of years to break down. Global annual plastic production doubled in the two decades since 2000 to around 460m tonnes and is expected to quadruple again by 2050.Less than 10% of this plastic wasteis now being recycled. The rest invariably ends up in the environment, with the equivalent of one truck filled with plastic dumping its contents into the ocean every minute, according to experts’ estimates. Much of this trash is composed of single-use plastics, such as straws, which make upabout40% of plastic production.The result of this boom has been a world riddled with plastics, with large or microscopic fragments of the material found in every corner of the planet,even in the air. Plastics choke and throttle marine creatures and birds and microplastics have been found deep within the bodies of animals, including humans.

Afrikaners are descended mainly from the Dutch, who began colonisingSouth Africain 1652, as well as French Huguenot refugees sponsored by the Dutch.More than three decades after white minority rule ended, South Africa remains hugely unequal, with land and wealth still largely concentrated among white people, who make up 7% of the population, about half native Afrikaans speakers, while black people are 81%.However, some white South Africansclaim they are discriminated against, often citing the country’s affirmative action laws.Trump’s executiveorder, signed on Friday, said there were “countless government policies designed to dismantle equal opportunity in employment, education, and business, and hateful rhetoric and government actions fuelling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners”.It added: “In addition, South Africa has taken aggressive positions towards the United States and its allies, including accusing Israel, not Hamas, of genocide in the international court of justice, and reinvigorating its relations with Iran to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.”Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire leading Trump’s efforts to slash the size of US government, including foreign aid spending, has criticised South Africa on his social media platform, X, for what he claimed were “openly racist policies”.South Africa’s foreign ministry said in astatementthat there seemed to be a “campaign of misinformation and propaganda”.“It is ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged, while vulnerable people in the US from other parts of the world are being deported and denied asylum despite real hardship,” it said. “We reiterate that South Africa remains committed to finding diplomatic solutions to any misunderstandings or disputes.”Conservative Afrikaner pressure groups said they were concerned about US aid to South Africa being cut and that South Africa would be excluded from the African Growth and Opportunity Act.The act is US legislation that needs to be renewed by the US Congress this year, which allows South African exporters, including farmers, to sell thousands of products to the US tariff-free.“This is indeed a crisis,” said Kallie Kriel, the CEO of Afriforum, which describes itself as a civil rights group for Afrikaners, but has been accused of racism. “If somebody is to blame it is the president and senior ANC [African National Congress party] leaders.”“We want to also show appreciation to President Trump … for recognising and identifying the discrimination that Afrikaners are experiencing through racial legislation … through threats to property rights,” Kriel told a press conference, adding: “We became a people here, we are Indigenous people in this country and we are going nowhere.”Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaTrump administrationCyril RamaphosaDonald TrumpElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Yet emails firstreportedon Monday morning by the Guardian, its reporting partner WWL Louisiana, the Associated Press and the New York Times establish how the Saints – owned by the devout New Orleans Catholic Gayle Benson – and team executives were far more involved in helping its local archdiocese spin media coverage of the abuse scandal than the organizations had previously acknowledged.The Saints and New Orleans’ archdiocese have each characterized the correspondence between them as well-intended public relations help that has been misconstrued by journalists.‘Crisis communications’: emails show how NFL’s Saints and NBA’s Pelicans helped New Orleans church spin abuse scandalRead moreNonetheless, Snap’s statement said the Saints “used their vast resources” as an NFL franchise “to support an organization that is accused of covering up sexual assault on innocent boys and girls”. The accusations to which Snap referred are contained in a sworn law enforcement statement filed in New Orleans’ criminal courthouse last April as part of a joint state and federal child sex-trafficking investigation focused on the archdiocese, which isallegedto have allowed clergymen to inflict sexual abuse on minors for decades and then successfully covered up most of those crimes.“TheNew Orleans Saints, the Catholic church, and every institution wielding influence over our communities must do more than protect their own reputations,” said a statement attributed to Letitia Peyton, the executive director of the clergy-abuse survivor support group TentMakers of Louisiana and the leader of Snap’s chapter in the state. “Prioritizing [public relations] over survivors perpetuates harm.”At a media briefing on Monday afternoon six days before New Orleans hosts Super Bowl LIX, the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell,hailedBenson and the Saints’ top brass as “great corporate citizens” when asked if the league would investigate the team’s use of its servers and logo in the emails with the church.“I’m confident that they are playing nothing more than a supportive role to help be more transparent in circumstances like this,” Goodell said of the Saints, who hadfoughtin court to keep the emails out of public view.Benson also owns the NBA’sNew Orleans Pelicans. The NBA – whose logo is also in the communications – has not responded to multiple requests for comment about the emails.In his own statement, the Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse (SCSA) founder Richard Windmann dismissed Goodell’s statement about the Saints and Pelicans emails with the church as “frivolous” and “avoiding the true issue”.“If the NFL has policies towards … sex abuse as they advertise publicly, we have not seen any action on them,” Windmann said. “Actually addressing this issue head-on would be a much better measure to maintain their reputations than using their PR teams to spin the story.”Snap, meanwhile, contended that Goodell “should use the power of his office to open an independent, thorough investigation into these disturbing revelations”.“We urge him to immediately undertake a probe of the New Orleans Saints, and when completed to make his findings public,” the Snap statement said.Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans clergy abuseNew Orleans SaintsNew Orleans PelicansCatholicismUS sportsNew OrleansLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

Musk claimed USAid was “a criminal organisation” and full of Marxists – an assertion called “laughable” by the agency’s former administrator under George W Bush, Andrew Natsios, who describes himself as a conservative Republican.Musk didn’t care. Less than three weeks afterDonald Trump’s inauguration, the head of the new “department of government efficiency” (Doge), a special group that Trump created, has built an extensive power base in Washington of a kind not seen before.Trump has given free rein to Musk to send his operatives into more than a dozen federal agencies to look for evidence of mismanagement and subversion, and to generally create chaos, outside of the usual bounds of oversight and regulation.Crucially, Musk now in effect controls the office of personnel management (OPM), which oversees federal employment. He immediately encouraged more than 2 million government workers to resign with the stated aim of forcing a few hundred thousand out the door.View image in fullscreenA supporter of Donald Trump interrupts an anti-Doge protest outside the Department of Labor in Washington on Wednesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIt’s clear who Musk thinks should be running the country instead, from his recruitment to Doge of “special government employees” from his own companies and the wider tech industry to storm the federal citadels. They include a significant proportion of young male software engineers of the kind who tend to worship tech billionaires like Musk, including a teenager who has gone by “Big Balls” online.Few, if any, have undergone the security clearances other government workers need to access sensitive and personal information. If they had, Doge might have been discouraged from hiring another recruit from Silicon Valley, Marko Elez, who was sent into the US treasury department, where he had access to taxpayer records. Elez resigned on Thursday after the Wall Street Journalrevealedhe had posted racist messages on social media and defended eugenics.“Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” Elez wrote onXin July.Hewas reinstatedon Friday.On the face of it, Musk is implementing Trump’s commitment to cut spending, “dismantle the deep state” and sack “rogue bureaucrats”. But his embrace of the far right, including an unrestrained endorsement of the German nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD), and what looked to much of the world like aNazi saluteat Trump’s inauguration celebrations, has raised urgent questions about Musk’s political beliefs and how he intends to use his newfound power.As it happens, much of what Musk is doing is also good for his businesses, including scrapping regulatory bodies and curtailing the power of unions and workers. The labor board, which upholds workers’ rights, has been frozen and agencies that regulated the financial industry have either been scrapped or told to abandon key parts of their work.Musk’s politics have been eclectic. In the past, he has backed universal basic income and a tax on carbon emissions. At the same time, he has a deep dislike of trade unions and public transport because it means being around “random strangers, one of whom might be a serial killer”. He espouses a visceral hostility to diversity programmes and appears to regard those who believe in helping the less fortunate as subversive.Thrown into this mix is Musk’s fascination with thepro-natalism movement, for which he has done his bit by fathering 12 children, and his hope that one day his rocket company, SpaceX, will help them colonise Mars.Raised in South Africaunder apartheid, Musk is clearly suspicious of democracy and the leaders it produces. His grandfather headed a fringe political movement in Canada in the 1930s, Technocracy Incorporated, which sought to abolish democracy in favour of government by elite technicians, but its overtones of fascism saw it banned during the second world war.Musk shows some of the same tendencies, as do other libertarian-leaningSilicon Valleybillionaires unhappy with the messiness of elected government. He has spoken in support of direct democracy, where policies and other issues are decided by popular referendums rather than elected representatives.In the meantime, Musk appears happy to embrace the US version of the “strongman” ruler through the Republican right’s “unitary executive theory”, which regards the authority of the president as paramount and Congress as an impediment to the implementation of his or her will.Over the years, Musk has described himself as “not a conservative” and “politically moderate”. He backed the Democratic candidate in every presidential election going back to Barack Obama’s victory in 2008 until he soured on the party in the past few years.View image in fullscreenBarack Obama and Elon Musk in 2010.Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters“In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party. But they have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican. Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold,” hewrote on Xin 2022.But there were clues to other motives, including a statement that he would be voting Republican because of Joe Biden’s support for trade unions and what he regarded as insufficient Democratic backing for his companies.Not long before last year’s presidential election, Musk declared that Trump would save American democracy from Democrats trampling on individual liberties. But he kept moving ever further to the right in public, with an open embrace of racist European political leaders, including the AfD, and the promotion of claims of a “white genocide” in the country of his birth, South Africa.Musk’s biographer, Walter Isaacson,has linkedhis shift from Obama voter to cheerleader for the AfD to the transition of his daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson.Wilson was 16 when she texted a relative: “Hey, I’m transgender, and my name is now Jenna. Don’t tell my dad.” The day after Wilson turned 18 in 2022, she changed her name because of “gender identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form”.Musk told Isaacson he was sanguine about the change but then Wilson became a fervent Marxist and wouldn’t speak to him any more, a situation he described as one of the most painful of his life.“She went beyond socialism to being a full communist and thinking that anyone rich is evil,” Musk told the author.Musk blamed Wilson’s progressive Los Angeles school and said he was disturbed at the “woke mind virus” holding back America.After Californiapassed a lawbarring school districts from requiring teachers to tell parents of changes to a student’s sexual orientation and gender identity, Musk announced he was moving the headquarters of his two largest companies, SpaceX and X, to Texas. He said that the law caused “massive destruction of parental rights” and put children at risk of “permanent damage”.Musk did not say that moving his companies also had significant tax advantages for himself and his businesses, which would additionally be subject to fewer climate regulations than in California.Still, his apparent anger over his daughter’s transition appears to have set in motion a broader hostility toward identity issues, and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes, a favourite target of the Trumpian right. Musk announced that the words “cis” and “cisgender” were considered slurs on X, and he came out against pronouns, tweeting that they “suck”.In late 2022, another tweet linked Musk’s hostility toward the way people choose to identify themselves – an odd position for a man who claims to be a champion of free speech – to his anger at the Biden administration’s Covid restrictions.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Elon Musk in November 2024.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersMusk mocked Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, who was instrumental in the lockdown and other measures to contain the crisis.“My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,”he wrote.Some saw the tweet as evidence that Musk was nowopenly identifying with the far right, which defied mask regulations and stay-at-home orders and called for Fauci to be locked up for intruding on their liberties.But while Musk’s hostility toward pronouns was personal, Covid regulations touched on his businesses and net worth.Muskrefused to closehis Tesla factory at the height of the pandemic, claiming without evidence that “panic” over the virus would do more damage than the disease itself. He disparaged social distancing, predicted that the virus would claim few lives in the US (it eventually claimed more than 1.2 million), and described the lockdown as “fascist” and “erasing people’s freedoms”. Musk tweeted a meme comparing Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to Hitler over his government’s Covid restrictions.Musk may have dressed up his position as a concern about people’s welfare but its immediate effect was to keep his factories rolling even if the people working in them were at greater risk of infection and death. And while Musk claimed a principled position in favour of individual liberty, he has a history of suppressing the rights of his own workers.In 2023, he said that he disagreed with the concept of trade unions.“I just don’t like anything whichcreates a lords-and-peasantssort of thing,” he told the New York Times Dealbook Summit. “Unions naturally try to create negativity in a company.”One reason Musk may not like unions is they tend to stand up for their members. He has faced accusations from former employees of aggressively using a secretive dispute-resolution process to fend off repeated claims ofsexual and racial harassmentwithin his companies, including accusations of women enduring a “frat house” atmosphere of groping and other abuses ignored and even perpetrated by high-level managers.Tesla haspaid outmillions of dollars to Black workers subjected toracial harassment.Yet, while Musk restricts the rights of his employees to seek redress from the courts, he and his companies filed at least 23 lawsuits in federal courts in the year to August 2024,according to Fortune magazine.They include a legal action by X against the Center for Countering Digital Hate overa reportaccusing the social network of making millions of dollars out of accounts spewing hate from “neo-Nazis, white supremacists, misogynists and spreaders of dangerous conspiracy theories”. A California judge threw out the lawsuit last year,sayingit was clear the “case is about punishing the defendants for their speech”.Musk will probably spend a lot more time being frustrated by the courts. Judges have already put on hold his push for mass resignations from the civil service and placed some restrictions on Doge’s mass collection of data. Federal workers, unions and civil rights organisations are lining up a flurry of lawsuits to challenge Musk’s actions.But the courts themselves may become a target for Musk as he works to tear down the old order.Isaacson in his biography wrote that Musk once described being in “a state of war at all times” as one of his default settings.No one thinks that, so long as Trump continues to regard the billionaire as more of an asset than a liability, Musk’s thirst for power will stop at gutting federal agencies. The question is where he will launch his next offensive."

She moved toLos Angelesin 1993 and to an apartment in the Altadena neighbourhood six years ago. The building was constructed by her landlord’s grandfather in the late 1930s.View image in fullscreenSandra French’s burned down house in Los Angeles.Photograph: Sandra French“It wasn’t just a square box, it was an apartment that had a lot of character,” French recalls by phone from a hotel near the Hollywood Hills. “My windows faced north and I had a view of the mountains every morning. I loved my apartment; I loved the community of Altadena. It was probably the best community I have lived in since I’ve been in LA. Everybody talks to everybody and helps everybody.”French was at home on the day the fires came, watching the winds pick up and following reports of fires in Pacific Palisades. At about 1.30pm the electricity went off so she could no longer watch the TV news. At around 6.30pm, in the dark, she happened to look out of her window and see the fire. She reckoned it was about 3 miles away at that point.French put some clothes and toiletries in a bag, but, assuming she would be back in a few days, did not take her computer. In high winds she drove her Honda Civic car to Pasadena and stayed at a friend’s house. When, days later, she returned to the site of her apartment, she was confronted with a scene of devastation.She reflects: “It’s quite an experience, waking up and one day you have everything, your home and all your possessions, and the next day you wake up and everything is gone. The building is basically just ash and rubble. The outside walls are standing but most of the windows are blown out and everything’s mangled. It was a two-floor building with a staircase: all of that collapsed so it’s just ash and rubble.“Driving through Altadena, it felt like a graveyard to me. Many neighbourhoods are wiped out. Entire blocks are gone. Then you’ll see the other neighbourhoods where most of the houses are standing: like three will be standing and one’s gone. But there’s a big majority of neighbourhoods in Altadena that did not survive the fire.”French, whose possessions were not insured, expresses gratitude to theInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees(Iatse),the union for below-the-line workers,and the Motion Picture Editors Guild for being supportive and generous to members who lost everything. Some were already struggling due to the economic shocks of recent years.Los Angeles musicians lost homes, studios and instruments: ‘A part of you is gone’Read more“It does feel different right now in Hollywood. So many people I know haven’t worked in a year, two years. For people in the film industry that have suffered this tremendous loss of their their home and possessions it’s a gut punch because we’ve already lost our livelihoods.“It’s overwhelming for me right now as a single person so it would be harder for families at this time. Now our homes and our possessions are destroyed, so I guess it’s a recovery and rebuilding time.”French is now pondering her future. She was ready to retire after being laid off by Paramount studios in 2022 and finding work scarce because of theactors’ and writers’ strikesthe following year.She adds: “I’m 65, so from now on out I’m going to probably live very minimally. At this point I’m trying to not rush into anything. I’m thinking about taking a trip and getting out ofCaliforniafor a little bit and regrouping and getting my thoughts together and seeing if I want to come back here or if I want to start anew somewhere.”The fires, one of the costliest natural disasters in American history, hit film and TV industry workers hard. Iatse reported that at one point, 8,100 of its members were in evacuation zones and more than 300 had lost their homes.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view shows homes burned in the Eaton Fire.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesThis comes on top of turbulent years in which Hollywood has endured Covid shutdowns, a pullback from the heady days of the streaming boom andincreased competitionfrom other states – such as Georgia, New York, New Jersey and New Mexico – and countries offering tax incentives. Work has not rebounded as hoped followingthe 2023 strikes, leaving many crew members unemployed and in financial hardship.Peyton Skelton, 51, a former gaffer on the TV medical drama Grey’s Anatomy and a director of photography, who lost his home of 25 years in Altadena, says: “The work situation in Los Angeles for film workers has been very slim. I’ve been working probably 60 to 70% less than I had been basically since the consolidation and the realisation by the studios and bigger companies that streaming as it was set up wasn’t profitable.“They started to do their condensing and realigning and cutting of business and taking the film business out of Los Angeles, out of the state and out of the country. That ended up being timed with when the strikes happened, though it’s not related to that. The strikes gave them a window to step back and look at a way to ‘fix’ their problem from a business standpoint.”Film and television production in Los Angeles had already fallen to a near-record low before the fires hit. The number of scripted series released last yeardropped by 24%. Location shoots in the Los Angeles region fell to its second-lowest total on record last year. Indeed, studio lots are so quiet that the actor Natalie Morales has called for studios to turn empty soundstages into temporary classrooms, erected by out-of-work craftspeople, for children whose schools burned down.Among those facing an uncertain future isJohn Dale, 40, a TV writer, and his wife Cameron Dale, 41, a costume designer, who have daughters aged eight, six and four. They had been renting a three-bedroom house in Pacific Palisades that was destroyed in the fire. Cameron lost a collection of costumes that represented a life’s work and is irreplaceable.Speaking from a family friend’s house, John Dale says: “We’re coming up on every two years something major impacts the industry, and even within less productions happening, you have the strike. You have this metaphorical win, but at the same time they say: ‘Yeah, we’ll give you all that but we’re just going to not produce anything for the next year.’ So you’re like, what did I really win? This contract is great for whoever can get it but those people are so few.“My wife’s show will come back in March, so hopefully at that point we’ll have a little bit more of a grasp on what our life will look like. But for me I’m just looking and trying to hope that there’s goodwill in that department. A lot of wheels are spinning.”View image in fullscreenAftermath of the Palisades fire in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood.Photograph: Allison Dinner/EPAThere are growing fears that the losses and difficulty of finding work in the city could lead to workers leaving Los Angeles. Dale adds:“I have friends that are pivoting. A lot of people talk about moving either ‘back home’ or doing something else. I’m considering getting a building contractor’s licence because I like to feel that sort of physical fulfilment as opposed to a writer’s room. If I can feel that sort of fulfilment within being somewhat responsible for bringing it back, I absolutely will.”Amid the devastation, there are signs of community rebuilding and industry resilience. Millions of dollars have been raisedto help fire victims. Efforts are under way to increase California’s tax credit programme to make it more competitive with other states and countries so that productions will be filmed locally. The Los Angeles city councilapproved a $1bn projectto enhance sound stages and production facilities at Television City.Mike Miller, Iatse international vice-president and motion picture & television production department director, says: “Covid was the first speed bump in what had been a significant period of growth. As we worked through the challenges that came with Covid we had a significant contraction in the industry. The streaming wars ended. The studios began producing less content.“Then there are many countries outside of North America that have continued to aggressively court this inherently North American industry by providing tax and other incentives to pull these jobs out of North America. I would love to see our federal government act to protect the entertainment industry the way it has to protect so many others.”And Miller remains optimistic that workers will overcome the fires, just as they have previous setbacks. “It’s been an incredibly difficult time for folks in our industry, many of whom have been struggling since Covid. It seemed like maybe we were heading back towards a little place of normalcy and then this happened. But I have to say I have not had a single person come in and say we’re giving up or we’re done with this business or we’re done with this town.”Explore more on these topicsCultureCalifornia wildfiresFilm industryCaliforniaLos AngelesUS televisionTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gambling revenue hit $99.4bn in 2022,accordingto the American Gaming Association (AGA), the industry lobby group.‘A serious disease’: Congress weighs federal gambling crackdown amid growing concernsRead moreSuper Bowl Sunday – the biggest sports event of the year – will be no exception. Even as TV networks have struggled to maintain audience numbers, with more people tuning in to video content online, the Super Bowl has continued to grow in viewership. In 2024, arecord123 million viewers tuned into the game, making it themost-watched telecastin history.The AGA estimated that $1.39bn worth of legal bets will be placed for Super Bowl LIX. This is the first year the trade association reported estimated bets solely from legal channels. In previous years, AGA relied on surveys that included all betting, including those placed illegally and casually among friends. Last year, research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gamingestimated$1.25bn of legal bets were placed for the Super Bowl last year.“No single event unites sports fans like the Super Bowl, and that excitement extends to sports betting, with this year’s record legal handle reflecting its widespread appeal,” said Bill Miller, the AGA president and CEO, in astatement.But as more Americans have wagered bets, and placing bets has become easier than ever, addiction experts and prevention advocates have warned about rising rates of gambling addiction.As gambling addiction rates rise, keep an eye on grandma this Super Bowl | Edith LangfordRead moreThere are an estimated 2.5 million adults in the US who meet the criteria for having a severe gambling problem, meaning their gambling behavior is damaging their life, relationships and career, according to theNational Council on Problem Gambling. Another 5 to 8 million Americans have mild to moderate gambling problems. Multiple problem gambling groups have reported an uptick in calls to gambling addiction hotlines after states legalized sports betting.Big game days such as theSuper Bowlare especially concerning for those who may be susceptible to problem gambling because the stakes are often higher.“For a person who has a gambling problem … they’ve been betting on games all season long, and they may have lost a lot of money, and the Super Bowl becomes kind of the ‘this is it, I’m going to make it or I’m going to break it’,” Rose Blocinski, executive director of Wisconsin Council of Problem Gambling,toldlocal news state WJFW.For Dr Tim Fong, a clinical professor of psychology and co-director of theGamblingStudies Program at the University of California at Los Angeles who studies gambling addiction, events including the Super Bowl can exacerbate potential addiction for those who are only in the early stages of problems.“By the time you see guys like me, things are really, really severe. What I’m worried about after this weekend: someone takes a bad loss, it hurts them financially. What are they going to donextweekend, after the Super Bowl?” Fong said. “Are they going to say, ‘You know what, I’m not going to do this again’, then just live their life? Or are they going to chase their losses and now bet on the NBA? And then bet on Major League Baseball in a month or so?“We can reduce the number of problems if we did more at an earlier stage,” Fong added.The Super Bowl and gambling are locked in a tight and dangerous embraceRead moreBetting companies have also become more aggressive at advertising. Last year, BetMGM, the sports betting arm of MGM Resorts, aired a star-studdedcommercialpromoting its platform during the Super Bowl. Fong said that it has all contributed to a normalizing of sports betting in American culture.Kids are seeing that “in America, this is just a part of what we do. There’s no questioning that this is harmful, this is dangerous, there’s a dark side to this. For the vast majority of people that bet on sports, it’s fun, it’s entertainment, it’s not damaging in any way,” Fong said. “But for the 1-2% that have this addiction, it’s really devastating.”Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LIXThe big betSport bettingSuper BowlGamblingUS sportsNFLnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, set to become the first incumbent president to attend a Super Bowl, it appears that the US’s most popular sport is genuflecting before him.Trump will reportedly attend the clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday in New Orleans as a guest of Gayle Benson, the owner of the New Orleans Saints. A pre-recorded interview conducted by a Fox News anchor will also air during the pre-game show of an event that last year was viewed bymore than 123m Americans. And while he watches the action, Trump will not have to stare at a message inspired by the kind of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) strategies that he is intent on bulldozing.The real-estate tycoon is back in the White House for the first time in four years and for the first time in aSuper Bowlsince 2021 the message “End Racism” will not be stencilled on to the field in one of the end zones. End Racism is a slogan the NFL began to promote after George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis in 2020. The phrase formed part of Inspire Change, a community social justice initiative the league launched in the wake of the former quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s activism against racism and police brutality.Super Bowl repeat or revenge? Whatever happens, history will be madeRead moreTrump, however, sought to use the protests to rile up his base during his first term, urging team owners to fire players who kneel during the anthem and encouraging fans to walk out. Thatdrew a ripostefrom the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, who said that “divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL”.Goodell told reporters on Monday that the league will continue its “diversity efforts” and an NFL spokesmantold The Athleticthat “Choose Love” and “It Takes All Of Us” will be written in the end zones as an appropriate response to the recent terrorist attack in New Orleans’ French Quarter, the Washington air collision and the Los Angeles wildfires.Still, the slogan change and the president’s planned presence in the Caesars Superdome are conspicuous at a time when American sports appear to be following the corporate sector in adopting policies ofappeasementor silence towards Trump, who has signed executive orders aimed ateliminating DEI initiativesin the federal government and pressurising private entities into stifling their programs. To his supporters this is a salvo in the“war on woke”.To his criticsthe tactic is a hallmark of a racist agenda.“President Trump loves a victory lap and this is certainly a victory lap over the NFL,” says Brandon Rottinghaus, a politics professor at the University of Houston and co-director of thePresidential Greatness Projectsurvey.The “Trump dance” became a viral celebration in the NFL after last November’s election, while on Wednesday the Chiefs’ biggest stars, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce,both said it will be “cool”to play in front of Trump. Kelce added that it will be “awesome” and “a great honor … no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited”. His enthusiasm raised eyebrows since he is in a relationship with Taylor Swift. The pop star endorsed Kamala Harris in the election and Trump responded by declaring “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” on social media.The basketball star LeBron James, who called Trumpa “bum”in 2017 and supported Harris last year, is among the previously outspoken high-profile athletes who have kept quiet so far in Trump’s second term. Of course, the administration is less than a month old. But Trump has been busy, issuing a flurry of directives on culture wars issues and inviting Elon Musk to eradicate large portions of the federal government. And Trump is explicitly using sports as a political tool, perhaps even more flagrantly than in his first term.At half time of the College Football Playoff National Championship on 20 January – Trump’s inauguration day – ESPN, the leading American sports network, aired avideo messagefrom Trump that amounted to a political broadcast in which he said Americans had “suffered greatly” under the Biden administration. ESPN said the gameaveraged 22m viewers, making it the most-watched non-NFL sporting event of the past year.View image in fullscreenTrump attended the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship game at the Superdome, where Sunday’s Super Bowl will be played.Photograph: Jamie Schwaberow/Getty ImagesAfter campaigning on a pledge to “keep men out of women’s sports”, on Wednesday, surrounded by young female athletes, Trump signed an executive orderbanning transgender athletesfrom taking part in women’s sports, the latest in a series of gender-related directives. The NCAA, US college sports’ governing body,fell in linethe next day with what its president, Charlie Baker, described as Trump’s “clear, national standard”.Though a sitting president’s Super Bowl attendance will be a novelty, American commanders-in-chief have a long tradition of attending baseball games: William Taft threw theceremonial first pitchon opening day in Washington in 1910. George W Bush, a former part-owner of the Texas Rangers, famouslytook to the moundbefore a 2001 World Series game at Yankee Stadium in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Trump, though, is probably more interested in other sports, and not merely because he wasbooedand subjected to a chant of “lock him up” in 2019 while attending a Washington Nationals World Series game only three miles away from the White House.Americans expected to place record $1.39bn in bets for Super Bowl LIXRead moreThe US will host the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games and Trump, who has achummy relationshipwith Fifa president Gianni Infantino, has a replica of the soccer trophy onprominent displayin the Oval Office. “I anticipate seeing the president very involved in the pop culture and sports worlds, it’s an easy way for him to connect to people,” Rottinghaus says.Barack Obama attended games and filled out an annual college basketball prediction bracket, but his relationship with sports seemed driven by passionate fandom more than political calculation. Trump sees sports as a vehicle with a value that goes far beyond photo opportunities with celebrities.“The infusion of sports culture and politics is a way that Donald Trump can demonstrate wins,” Rottinghaus adds. “It’s one thing to eliminate DEI at agencies in government that most people have never heard of, it’s another to get theNFLand individual teams to change the way that they message their product. That’s a different kind of win that’s really the kind of thing that his supporters want.”Trump’s fractious relationship with the NFL predates the anthem controversy. Long a frustrated wannabe team owner, he made a failed attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2014 in what turned into a fierce rivalry with a bidspearheaded by Jon Bon Jovi. And as the owner of the New Jersey Generals, a team in the defunct United States Football League, he led anill-fated anti-trust lawsuitagainst the NFL in 1986 with the aim of forcing a merger. But he wasfeted by fanson a visit to a Pittsburgh Steelers game last October, while in his previous term as president he named the co-owner of the New York Jets, Woody Johnson, as ambassador to the UK.The Republicanwrote on Fridaythat it “WILL BE A GREAT GAME!!!” However, the state of relative calm between Trump and the NFL might be contingent on the musical entertainment and whether the Chiefs win their third successive title. The half-time show is not usually overtly political but this year it is headlined by the rapper Kendrick Lamar, whose 2015 track Alright wasadoptedby Black Lives Matter demonstrators. In 2017 herapped: “Donald Trump is a chump”.Trump, meanwhile, hailed the Chiefs on social media after their AFC Championship Game victory over the Bills a fortnight ago: “Congratulations to theKansas City Chiefs. What a GREAT Team, Coach, Quarterback, and virtually everything else, including those fantastic FANS, that voted for me (MAGA!) in record numbers.”He also praised the Bills. But there was no mention of the Eagles thrashing the Washington Commanders earlier in the day. Philadelphia won the Super Bowl in 2018. That year Trump scrapped their invitation to the White House - an honor habitually afforded to the victorious team - after it became clear thatalmost none of the players or staffwere willing to attend as a result of his divisive conduct. Last year Trump depicted the heavily-Democratic city as acrime-ravaged dystopia. Another Philadelphia victory might re-ignite hostilities and explode what appears to be an uneasy truce – or else offer more evidence that the sporting climate has shifted from resistance to acceptance.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlDonald TrumpPhiladelphia EaglesKansas City ChiefsSuper Bowl LIXUS sportsNFLfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the Eagles kept winning, including all three NFC playoff games, Graham started to hint he could put on his No 55 jersey – he considered it a good luck sign when the Eagles scored 55 points in the NFC title game – in theSuper Bowl.Super Bowl repeat or revenge? Whatever happens, history will be madeRead moreGraham returned to practice as a limited participant last week and was listed as a full participant on Friday’s injury report. He was officially back on the 53-man roster Saturday.Graham said this week in New Orleans that he envisioned himself running out of the tunnel for Super Bowl introductions.“It’ll feel great because you worked your butt off to get back,” Graham said. “I know the team worked their butt off to get here and I want to be there for them.”Graham is one of two position players and four players overall left from the Eagles’ Super Bowl championship team in the 2017 season.The Eagles’ first-round pick out of Michigan in 2010, Graham said in training camp this would be his final season. His injury caused him to reexamine his choice, though his retirement decision isn’t final.He is responsible for one of the great moments in Eagles history with his strip-sack of New England’s Tom Brady in the Super Bowl with 2:21 left in the fourth quarter. Derek Barnett recovered and the Eagles hung on to win 41-33.Graham missed most of 2021 with a torn Achilles tendon, but came back the next season to get a career-high 11 sacks. Graham had three and a half sacks in 11 games this season before he was injured. He holds the franchise record with five and a half career postseason sacks.Graham played 18 snaps without a tackle or sack when Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs beat the Eagles 38-35 two years ago.The Chiefs on Saturday elevated linebacker Swayze Bozeman and cornerback Steven Nelson from the practice squad. They did not activate wide receiver Skyy Moore, who has been on IR but had practiced in the week leading up to the Super Bowl.Without Graham, the Eagles have enjoyed success using a three-player rush combination of Nolan Smith, Josh Sweat and Jalyx Hunt.“I don’t want to get in the way of the rhythm of what everybody already has,” Graham said. “If I can just add anything, I want to give everything I’ve got.”Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia EaglesSuper BowlSuper Bowl LIXKansas City ChiefsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Really good to see that after going through a surgery, now being back playing basketball.”But it’s far less than the Nets hoped when they acquired the three-time All-Star in a trade for James Harden at the 2022 trade deadline. He was never able to join Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving on the court that season after hurting his back trying to work his way back into shape after sitting out the first half of that season in Philadelphia.The injury problems, mostly due to lower back nerve damage, continued to limit Simmons. He made it through just half of the 2022-23 season, during which Durant and Irving were both traded, and played only 15 games last season.Simmons played in 33 of the Nets’ 52 games this season, starting 24, and averaged 6.2 points and 6.9 assists.Simmons is making $40m this season and would be a free agent afterward. ESPN reported that he would meet with Cleveland and the Los Angeles Clippers about signing with them for the rest of this season.Explore more on these topicsBrooklyn NetsNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

On the top step of the podium. A “Weltmeisterin” (world champion) in Austria, the home of ski racing.Not a bad way to earn your first victory.“I was psyched because I knew that I had skied my best,” the 29-year-old Johnson said. “I’m just going to enjoy this because I’ve had a lot of times where I gave my best and I didn’t win. … You have to be happy with your own skiing or your existence becomes very sad very quickly.”Johnson finished 0.15 seconds ahead of silver medalist Mirjam Puchner of Austria and 0.21 ahead of bronze medalist Ester Ledecká, the Czech athlete who has won Olympic golds in both skiing and snowboarding.Lauren Macuga, the American who took bronze in super-G two days earlier, finished fifth. And 40-year-oldLindsey Vonnwas 15th.As the victory began to sink in, Johnson grew emotional as she considered the past few years of her career.The Jackson Hole, Wyoming, native was on the verge of victory when she recorded three second-place World Cup results over a one-year period ending in December 2021. Then a crash a month later ruled her out of the 2022 Beijing Olympics with a knee injury.Before the next season, Johnson came out as bisexual. She posted on Instagram at that time: “To those people out there who feel a little different and want to see people like them at the top I am here to represent that we are out there, we are normal, and we can do whatever we want.”But Johnson was then sidelined again when she missed three anti-doping exams and violated “whereabouts” rules that oblige athletes to detail where they can be found for one hour each day to give samples. The violation resulted in a 14-month ban that expired two months ago.After her victory Saturday, Johnson said the first missed test “was my fault.” For the second one she said she texted her whereabouts to the wrong number. Then for the third missed test, she said “there was a glitch on the app.\"”“I think a lot of athletes would agree with me to say that it’s a very challenging system,” Johnson said. “I acknowledge that I could have done better.”Downhill standout Sofia Goggia was unforgiving in her assessment of Johnson’s ban, though.View image in fullscreenBreezy Johnson competes in the women’s downhill on Saturday.Photograph: Lisi Niesner/Reuters“We have availability every day. Every night, I have to say where I sleep and I have to give the time slot. I set it between 5 and 6 in the morning and this year at Christmas they came to ring my bell,” Goggia, who finished 16th, said Saturday. “We have rules to follow. We stick to the procedure. Period.”While she was out, Johnson was not allowed to train with the US team. So she funded her own training in Jackson Hole and in the Alps and hired her own coach, Stefan Abplanalp, as well as experts at setting up training courses.Lindsey Vonn’s ‘impossible’ comeback roars on with 2026 Olympics in frameRead more“Those people really helped me a ton and obviously it was a little bit lonely. But it brought more people into the village,” Johnson said. “So this is also for them.”Perhaps because of her ban, Johnson has no sponsor on her headgear.The gold medal might change that, though.The race was held exactlyone year before the Milan-Cortina Olympicswomen’s downhill, which will be on the track in Cortina d’Ampezzo where Vonn holds the record of 12 World Cup wins and where Jacqueline Wiles, another active American, has finished on the podium twice.Wiles was also fast before she went off course during her run Saturday.“We have such a strong team and it’s so cool to be able to do it on a world stage,” Macuga said. “Next year in Cortina … I think it might be pretty exciting.”The US team is also well poised for Sunday’s men’s downhill, with Ryan Cochran-Siegle having led two of the three training sessions.“When I’m feeling confident, I feel like I do a good job of stacking the ski at the top of the turn and really driving in and creating power,” said Cochran-Siegle, the Olympic silver medalist in super-G. “I feel like that the tempo is familiar to me. … The light is nice.

The bout was stopped in the ninth round and Cooney had subsequently undergone surgery after it was discovered he had an intracranial haemorrhage. The bout was his first defence of the Celtic super-featherweight title.A further statement was posted on Saturday night by Dunlop on behalf of the Cooney family, confirming that the boxer had died after a “week of battling for his life”.It read: “It is with complete devastation that we have to announce that after a week of battling for his life John Cooney has sadly passed away. Mr and Mrs Cooney and his fiancee Emmaleen would like to thank the staff at Belfast’s Royal Victoria hospital who have worked tirelessly to save John’s life and for everyone who has sent messages of support and prayers.“He was a much loved son, brother and partner and it will take us all a lifetime to forget how special he was. RIP John ‘the Kid’ Cooney.”Cooney won the title with a win over Liam Gaynor in Dublin in November 2023 but spent a year out of the ring with a hand injury. He returned in October with a victory over Tampela Maharusi.Explore more on these topicsBoxingIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

There were plenty of Brighton supporters who would have justifiably viewed this fixture with some trepidation given their abject performance in the record7-0 Premier League defeatat Nottingham Forest. But despite falling behind to a dreadful error from Bart Verbruggen when he spilled Cole Palmer’s cross into his own net after just five minutes, a rousing comeback inspired by Georginio Rutter, their record signing, made it a night to remember against opponents that are not the most popular in these parts given recent history between the two clubs.Brighton v Chelsea: FA Cup fourth round – liveRead moreThere were wild celebrations when Kaoru Mitoma – who was the subject of a £61m bid from Al-Nassr during the transfer window – put Brighton ahead midway through the second half after Rutter had equalised with a clever header, with Hürzeler enjoying his moment of redemption as his side recorded their first win here since beating Manchester City at the start of November.“It was just what the doctor ordered,” said the Brighton manager. “We’ve had a tough week and the guys showed real character to come back after the start we had. It’s important to stay calm and not overreact when things don’t go your way.”Enzo Maresca felt that there had been a handball in the buildup to Mitoma’s winning goal but this was another disappointing away performance from his expensively assembled side, who have now gone five matches on the road without victory.“For sure we need to learn how to win games 1-0,” said Maresca, whose side also took an early lead last week at Manchester City. “It’s a shame but if there is something positive about this it is that now we can focus on the Premier League and Conference League.”Hürzeler’s watchword this week following the humiliation against Forest had been “intensity”, with the Brighton manager admitting that there had been some honest exchanges with his players in training. He certainly got a response, with the lynchpin Carlos Baleba impressing in midfield on his return from injury and Rutter providing some of the cutting edge that has been missing in recent weeks.View image in fullscreenBrighton’s Kaoru Mitoma lifts the ball over Chelsea keeper Robert Sánchez to give the home side the lead.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAMaresca usually likes to rotate almost his entire side for cup matches but this was more a hybrid team that featured six changes from the comeback win against Graham Potter’s West Ham last week and they lacked cohesion throughout. With the strikers Nicolas Jackson and Marc Guiu both out injured, Christopher Nkunku was ineffective in attack as Brighton comfortably closed out the win.Potter was one of 11 players or staff poached byChelseain the space of 17 months and the antipathy towards them clearly remains among the home supporters, with Moisés Caicedo, Marc Cucurella and Robert Sánchez roundly booed from the first whistle until the last. But they and Hürzeler could not have had a worse start as Chelsea were handed the lead inside the opening five minutes by Verbruggen’s blunder. The Brighton goalkeeper had already been called into a save when he tipped Palmer’s shot over the bar and there seemed to be no danger when Palmer volleyed the ball across goal from Jadon Sancho’s pass. Yet Verbruggen took his eye off the ball and it somehow squirmed out of his grasp.Fortunately for him, Brighton were level six minutes later when Rutter’s precise header found the bottom ­corner from Joel Veltman’s cross. Nkunku surprisingly decided against shooting when he was played in on goal and Palmer’s looping header from his pass missed the target in the closest Chelsea had come to restoring their lead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A clever piece of improvisation from Rutter after Tariq Lamptey’s shot was blocked played in Mitoma and he managed to flick the ball into the net over the despairing Sánchez after chesting it into his own path.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Maresca responded by introducing Enzo Fernández off the bench and the Argentina midfielder’s first act was to strike a shot well off target.

Kylian Mbappé and Julián Álvarez had looked out from Madrid’s front pages on the morning of the city derby, the media turning Marvel Comic, and they will probably be there on Sunday too but this isn’t over. The man they liken to a Mutant Turtle and the striker they call The Spider scored one each as another derby finished 1-1, leaving these two great rivals first and second inLa Liga, a single point between them, left to fight another day.Between them Mbappé and Álvarez had already scored 37 goals in their debut seasons; on a night that took a while to get going but did eventually become a real contest if certainly not a classic, they took that to 39. Atlético started in the ascendency then Real were revived.Real Madrid 1-1 Atlético Madrid: La Liga – live reactionRead moreUltimately, though, neither delivered the decisive blow: there was no dramatic final scene, no epic end, just a title race getting ever tighter and a feeling that the real fights were put off for another day with a growing cast. A win on Sunday would leave Barcelona two points behind Real, one behind Atlético.“This was a draw in which we will both feel we could have taken the points,” Diego Simeone said.If Atlético started on the front foot, the first half was a slow burn; the visitors were in control but there was a caution about them. While Real had no shots on target by the break, Atlético had only one, although it was sufficient to give them the lead. It came when Javi Galán’s cross from the left ran through the area and Aurélien Tchouaméni put a leg out and trod on Samu Lino’s foot.Quick GuideEuropean roundup: Dortmund lose, Leverkusen heldShowBorussia Dortmundslumped to a 2-1 home defeat againstVfB Stuttgartand finished with 10 men in a disappointing first game as coach for Niko Kovac that dropped his team further away from the Bundesliga's Champions League qualification spots.Kovac took over after Dortmund sacked Nuri Sahin in late January. Last season’s Champions League finalists are on 29 points in 11th, while Stuttgart are on 35 in fourth, the last of the automatic Champions League qualification spots.Stuttgart took an unexpected lead when the Dortmund defender Waldemar Anton turned a cutback into his own goal in the 50th minute. They doubled it with Jeff Chabot’s header at the far post just past the hour.The hosts, who were dominant after the break, cut the deficit with Julian Brandt’s low drive from a tight angle in the 81st but their efforts to get an equaliser were derailed when the defender Julian Ryerson was sent off with a second booking.Bayer Leverkusenstumbled to a goalless draw atWolfsburgto drop eight points behind Bayern Munich, the leaders, though Xabi Alonso equalled the all-time coach record for the league's longest unbeaten away run.The Spaniard rotated heavily ahead of their ninth game in 26 days, leaving Florian Wirtz on the bench initially. The champions clearly missed his attacking spark as Wolfsburg got more shots on target. The hosts even hit the woodwork with Kilian Fischer's powerful drive in the 74th and despite some late pressure and a golden chance in stoppage time by the substitute Wirtz, Leverkusen could not find a winner.In Serie A, Sergio Conceição was pleased his decision to \"gamble\" by still going for a win whenMilanwere reduced to 10 men paid off againstEmpoli.After a goalless first half, the Portuguese coach brought on attacking players Santiago Giménez, Rafael Leão and Christian Pulisic, before his side went down to 10 men with Fikayo Tomori's second yellow card in the 55th minute. Empoli were also reduced following Luca Marianucci's straight red card before Leão opened the scoring with a header off a Pulisic cross in the 68th minute and Giménez sealed the 2-0 win eight minutes later.\"The temptation at that moment [after the red card] was to take off a striker, to put in a defender, but I didn't do it,\" Conceicao told DAZN. \"A draw here is like a defeat for Milan, so I had to take the gamble.\"ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.At first it had gone unseen but there was a pause as the referee, César Soto Grado, put his finger in his ear. It had looked light, a little lazy too, a leg put out for no real reason, but the contact was clear and when the referee eventually went to the screen, he decided it was enough. “People in football don’t understand this,” Carlo Ancelotti said.From the spot, Álvarez clipped in the opener. Atlético tightened their control; the frustration might have been that it did not lead to more goals. It wasn’t so much that they were missing opportunities: there was no catalogue of chances and not one save from Thibaut Courtois; it was more that the positions they worked were then wasted, an imprecision in those key moments, the touch lacking when it was needed most. “We didn’t have the clarity we normally have,” Simeone said of a flaw they would not shake off all night and one they paid for.The teams had gone off to a strange silence at half-time, maybe even a resignation, but when they came back out the noise levels soon rose and Real awoke.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Next Bellingham hit the bar and then had another header saved by Jan Oblak. It was not just that this was a different game now; it was that it wasagame, a derby the way it’s supposed to be, loud and open, a tension to it all. At least for a little while.Vinícius Júnior and Mbappé had been activated, Rodrygo an even more significant threat. Bellingham led them forward. Atlético were under pressure but did find their way out at times, usually on the right. A pattern had been set: Real pressing, Atlético waiting to counter. Giuliano Simeone slipped when Álvarez set up a superb opportunity, Marcos Llorente’s pull back was cut out by Tchouaméni and Álvarez so nearly provided for Antoine Griezmann.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.At the other end, Dani Ceballos shot at Oblak, who also saved a Tchouaméni header, a Rodrygo strike and Vinícius’s effort. An Mbappé shot lacked the power of the run that preceded it and the momentum slowed a little. But with eight minutes left Vinícius escaped two lunges and clipped a ball to Rodrygo whose volley flew wide, that shot count up from zero to eight, and with a single minute to go it might have been nine and the victory. Fede Valverde dashed through and slipped in Mbappé. It hadn’t been the greatest of games, but here was the Turtle’s moment.

Greed is football’s real shortcoming, not extra timeJonathan WilsonShootouts are the least bad way the game has found to settle drawn matches, but they should be a last resortSat 8 Feb 2025 15.00 ESTShareSo Uefa is consideringdoing away with extra time, at least in the knockout stage of the Champions League, another grand old tradition swept away as the arc of history bends towards the generation of revenue for the already wealthy. This is the way of the world and so it is the way of football, all that is great and glorious about the game desecrated to produce more content to be sold.But first, a caveat, an increasingly necessary one as middle age hurtles by. Is this about age? Are our responses to extra time conditioned by our formative years? My first FA Cup final was 1982, a drab game enlivened by Glenn Hoddle putting Tottenham ahead after 110 minutes and Terry Fenwick heading an equaliser five minutes later (Spurs then won the replay). TheSchumacher-BattistonWorld Cup semi-final in Seville came six weeks later: at 90 minutes it was 1-1, by the 98th minute it was 3-1 to France and by the end it was 3-3 and West Germany had won on penalties. The following year’s FA Cup final also went to extra time asManchester United drew with Brighton; although there were no goals in the added 30 minutes, there was the drama of Gordon Smith’s late miss.What becomes of diehard football fans who stop going to matches?Read moreBy the age of six, I was fully convinced extra time meant excitement and that it was a good thing, a view that has barely been challenged by the fact that five of the Africa Cup of Nations finals I’ve attended have finished 0-0 before being decided on penalties. Maybe this is just another example of football acting as a great nostalgic comfort blanket and everybody instinctively resisting any deviation from the game with which we fell in love.But what is the justification for scrapping it? That players are playing too much? How many periods of extra time do sides play over a season? Over the past two seasons, just oneChampions Leagueknockout tie has gone to extra time. That’s not why fatigue is such an issue. Players are playing too much because football’s authorities keep making tournaments bigger and inventing new ones. You want to spare players’ legs? Maybe don’t add two extra group games and a possible knockout round – the equivalent of 12 periods of extra time – to the Champions League. Maybe don’t create a Club World Cup, the winners of which would play the equivalent of 21 periods of extra time, plus any actual extra time.Is it so that everybody has a clearer time of when games end? Are we to believe that Uefa, the body that presided over the chaos of theChampions League finals of Parisand Istanbul and the Deutsche Bahn-fuelled farrago of Euro 2024, suddenly cares about fans?Do we want more football settled by something that is less than football?Is it to make scheduling easier for television companies? That’s possibly true, but it seems less of a concern when the video assistant referee is taking 10 minutes to determine when a ball has brushed an arm.And anyway, if this is television dictating such issues, it’s a clear case of placing the cart before the horse. Is it really a radical proposition to suggest the sport must always come first? The thought occurred afterTottenham’s victory over Tamworthin the third round of the FA Cup when some argued that not only had the abolition of replays denied the fifth-tier side a money-spinning replay, but their chances of pulling off a shock were significantly reduced by the tie going to extra time. On the one hand, that is true: a Premier League side will outlast a team of part-timers. But on the other, for the game to have gone straight to penalties would have felt gimmicky.No football, not even the third round of the FA Cup, should simply be about the generation of shocks. If that were the case, you may as well randomly select two games a round to be decided by the toss of a coin. Shocks are not good in and of themselves but because of what they say about the strength of the pyramid, and because of the real beauty of football, which is that diligence, application and organisation (and fortune), gives even much weaker sides a chance of eliminating a stronger side. Shocks must be earned, even if that just means the weaker team packing their box with 11 players and hurling bodies in the way of the ball.Nobody now can seriously believe that penalty shootouts are lotteries but, equally, they test one component of the sport. Penalties are a part of football but they are not football. They may be the least bad way football has found to settle drawn games, but they should be a last resort. Inevitably, the abolition of extra time means more games will be settled on penalties. Is that really what we want, more football settled by something that is less than football?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People watch football because they like football, and if they don’t like football, why are you trying to make them watch it? It’s not medicine for a child, to be forced down with a dollop of sugar and strawberry flavouring.There’s no footballing argument for doing away with extra time. This is not nostalgia talking. Shorter does not necessarily equal better. Like so much else, this feels like cosmetic change under consideration because of a refusal to address the biggest issue, which is the vast disparities in wealth and revenue distribution. Perhaps it is a conservative position, but it really shouldn’t be seen as reactionary to believe that when addressing the future of football, the most important consideration should be football itself.Explore more on these topicsUefaInside footballChampions LeagueFifaFootball politicscommentShareReuse this content"

He was 23 years old, had just arrived from Hull and considered himself in pretty good shape. Until, that is, he was made to run Jürgen Klopp’s sadistic pre-season gauntlet for the first time.Basically, you do laps of the training pitch. The required pace gradually quickens, in the manner of a bleep test. Unlike in a bleep test, however, at regular intervals a member of Klopp’s medical staff will come over, puncture your ear and – ew – extract a sample of blood from it. High lactate levels indicate fatigue; too high and you’re done. Pretty soon Robertson was feeling queasy. He started gagging. Full discharge followed soon after. It may not surprise you to know that James Milner won the Melwood lactate test eight years running.Liverpool’s Kelleher not guaranteed to start Carabao Cup final, Arne Slot admitsRead moreThe lactate test went with Klopp, but last summer the German’s replacement,Arne Slot, and his physical guru, Ruben Peeters, replaced it with something less auricularly intrusive but just as gruelling: the six-minute race test. Six minutes of full-pelt running around the pitches, in scorching heat, with no breaks. “Give everything you have for these six minutes,” Slot orders. This pre-season, a 32-year-old Mohamed Salah destroyed all comers.Liverpool’s annual orgy of summer suffering, originally under Klopp and now under Slot, has long held quasi-mythical status. “Pre-season is hard everywhere, but I never hadthreetraining sessions a day before in my life,”Dominik Szoboszlaibewailed of his first hazing after moving from RB Leipzig. And, of course, as both coaches understood, there was always more to this physical beasting than simply measuring VO2levels.For it is these moments – long before the start of the season and out of the public eye – that also forge character. That bond teams. It is no coincidence that Slot makes his players do the six-minute challenge in groups rather than individually. Something in shared agony seems to tie them closer. This is hell, but we’re in hell together. As the last seconds of the six minutes tick away, Slot’s charges collapse to the turf in pure exhaustion, but also a kind of euphoria: an emotional link that will sustain them through the long winter months.Anyway,Federico Chiesamissed all this. It wasn’t his fault. Hesigned from Juventusfor £10m right at the end of the window in August, missed the start of the season, missed the friendly tour, the bonding sessions, the card games on the plane, the visit tothe Rocky steps in Philadelphia. He missed the tactical drills, the chance to find his place in the system. And, of course, he missed the six-minute race test.Even in a profession obsessed by small details, Slot seems to dwell on this stuff longer than most: chemistry, team-building, how to think as a collective. One of his first moves asLiverpoolmanager was to institute a compulsory team breakfast. Team meetings are held almost on a daily basis, rather than weekly under Klopp.View image in fullscreenAgainst Accrington Stanley Federico Chiesa showed a glimpse of the talent that lit up Euro 2020 for Italy.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThis past week Slot was asked how his side has managed to improve as the season goes on, from an already impressive start. “The more meetings you have, the more training sessions you have, the better they know what they have to expect from each other,” Slot replied.And, of course, when your team are six points clear in the Premier League and your personal brand is impeccable, you can say pretty much whatever you want. By way of contrast, imagine the snorts of derision if Gary O’Neil, say, had insisted the secret to unlocking success on the pitch was having as many team meetings as possible.But when you are winning, every sentence you utter is a golden nugget of wisdom, every decision a stroke of genius, even the accidental decisions, even the ones that aren’t even really decisions. Ryan Gravenberch in midfield: a revelation, a masterstroke, and let’s not dwell too hard on the fact Liverpool spent most of the summer tryingto upgrade him to Martín Zubimendi.In this category you might also slot Chiesa. For most of the season, Liverpool’s only signing of Slot’s first transfer window looked predestined to join a long list – Alberto Aquilani, Fabio Borini, Mario Balotelli, Andrea Dossena – of Italian players who mysteriously never really did it at Liverpool. He’s played only 25 minutes in the Premier League in three substitute appearances.Naturally there was some interest from the Saudi Pro League in January, some idle talk of a loan move. Italian newspapers churn out plaintive pieces lamenting his fate. Juventus fans under his Instagram posts beg him to come home. The national team coach, Luciano Spalletti,urged him to return to Serie A– a little ominously – “so I could keep him under observation”.On the face of things, Chiesa’s prolonged absence has felt a little strange – even when you take into account his lack of a pre-season, the sparkling form of Salah in his favoured right-wing position. Yes, there have been niggling injuries in the autumn, but he’s still mostly been available. Yes, Liverpool are playing brilliantly, but four competitions offers plenty of scope for rotation. Yes, he came into the campaign undercooked. But it’s been more than five months and he’s still not even making league squads. Just how much pre-season does this guy still need?The answer, counterintuitively, lies on the pitch. In a league where the dominant tactical note is increasingly a kind of rampaging chaos, Slot’s Liverpool play complex, refined passing football: intricate rehearsed combinations, movement choreographed and drilled in painstaking detail, decision trees upon decision trees.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis is what all the meetings were for. This is why Slot mapped out those first weeks so meticulously. Because this is not the kind of football where you can just plug in and play. Of course this was often the case under Klopp, too: Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister previously arrived in early summer and integrated fairly smoothly. Gravenberch and Cody Gakpo, both mid-season signings, took months to get going. The less said about Arthur Melo, the better.View image in fullscreenFederico Chiesa made his fifth appearance for Liverpool against Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup in January.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAFrozen out by Thiago Motta at Juventus and now arriving at Melwood with no training block under his belt, Chiesa found himself, as Slot put it, “left behind”. The step up in intensity from Serie A to the Premier League also created its own challenges. And as the months rolled away, it was possible to view the Chiesa signing as a kind of misplaced opportunism, a bargain for the sake of a bargain, the footballing equivalent of those ready meals with a yellow sticker in the supermarket. You don’t strictly need it. But how wrong can a 39p beef rendang really go?For all his setbacks, this is still a player with a considerable upside: verve and flair, searing acceleration, the ability to take defenders out of the game. As Spalletti puts it: “There aren’t many players who are capable of looking you in the eye and breaking through defensive lines one on one.” And – whisper it – in recent weeks, Chiesa has been showing tantalising glimpses of the player who lit up Euro 2020.Miron Muslic: ‘We became refugees overnight. It was just devastating’Read moreHis first goal came off the bench against Accrington Stanley in the third round of the FA Cup. Then followed a full 90 minutes against PSV in the Champions League, a 3-2 defeat from which he still emerged with a great deal of credit,creating both goals for Gakpo and Harvey Elliott. It was his first full 90 minutes since Euro 2024. A trip to Plymouth on Sunday afternoon should offer another opportunity for minutes.And through it all, despite barely touching a football pitch, Chiesa has quietly charmed the fanbase. It helps that he is so clearly delighted to be there, already fluent in English, utterly transfixed by the Liverpool aura, the Anfield roar, the chance to scale the biggest pinnacles in the sport. It helps too that he has avoided the temptation to sulk or brood, has been happy to wait for his chances and smile through his frustration.Now, perhaps, Chiesa’s moment may be close. The second half of Liverpool’s season will stretch their resources to the limit. A potential 28 games remain, and Salah will not be able to play them all, and nor will anybody. Chiesa may not be a regular starter, and he may not be the heir to Salah, but he will certainly be needed: perhaps as an impact substitute, perhaps as a locksmith against lower-block sides, perhaps even as a modern-day Divock Origi, the man who just pops up with the memorable goal when it is required.Perhaps the defining theme of Slot’s time at Liverpool so far has been patience: patience on the ball, patience from fans and the club hierarchy, the patience required to stare a record-tying 20th league title in the eye and not to snatch at it. The patience to make only one summer signing, keep him out of the team for five months so he can do shuttle runs, and then unleash him fresh for the run-in. A shrewd stratagem, or simply a happy alignment of circumstances? When you’re in Liverpool’s position, it scarcely matters.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolThe ObserverArne SlotFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Spurs need something today | David HytnerRead moreThe teenagers Dane Scarlett – who is ineligible to face Villa after playing for Oxford in an earlier round while on loan – Oyindamola Ajayi and Mikey Moore all scored in the3-0 win over Elsfborgat the end of January that secured progress to the last 16 of the Europa League. But, having seen some of his more experienced players singled out for their poor performances against Liverpool, Postecoglou – who will be without Richarlison as a result of the calf injury he picked up at Anfield – stressed he has a duty to protect those who are taking the first steps in their professional careers.“It’s one thing to put them on late in a European game but I’m not going to expose young players to that … we saw what happened and our players are now getting criticised,” he said of the outcome at Anfield.“Most of them will be able to handle it but I wouldn’t want to expose a young player to something like that, especially the way the world is today. You know, we don’t want to make determinations in a snap instance and destroy careers. I’m not going to expose young players who I don’t think are ready for that.“So we don’t have the opportunity to rotate but I think it will be a similar kind of team that rolls out on Sunday. We’ve been doing this for quite a while now for the last three months and we have handled that pretty well at times and that’s what we will try and do on Sunday.”The new signings Kevin Danso and Mathys Tel both made their debuts at Liverpool, with the latter coming on as a second-half substitute.

A remarkable tie, played at remarkable pace, stuffed with incident and endeavour, and illuminated by a stunning goal from Tomoki Iwata, was settled in favour of the Premier League side by two goals from Joe Willock. Yet Birmingham will draw not merely a lot of pride from their performance but also encouragement that if they are promoted out of League One, they will be able to cope at the higher level.Birmingham might also wonder whether Willock’s first goal crossed the line. “It’s a 50-50 chance the decision goes in your favour and it didn’t,” said the Birmingham manager, Chris Davies. Although Bailey Peacock-Farrell’s feet were well behind the line when he reacted sharply to punch away Willock’s close-range shot, whether the whole of the ball had crossed the whole of the line was an extremely close-run thing. With no goalline technology, the decision fell to the linesman Nigel Lugg, a former warehouse operations manager from Croydon, and he judged it had.Birmingham City v Newcastle United: FA Cup fourth round – liveRead moreBut even if that was tight, there could be no real sense of grievance for the home side given that when Ethan Laird, in an extremely necessary moment of self-preservation, ducked his head to allow Iwata’s 25-yard shot to flash over him and into the top corner, he was in an offside position. It would have taken the stoniest of hearts to rule that effort out, but a video assistant referee probably would have done.This wasn’t a day for such modern concerns. The weather was ideal for the fourth round of the Cup, a thick veil of drizzle casting everything in an appropriately nostalgic soft focus, before yielding to heavy second-half rain. It was a game of robust challenges and boisterous old-fashioned excitement, filtered through a modern lens. Although promotion is clearly the priority for Birmingham, this was a game that mattered, something clear from the dozen or so lads in Burberry caps and scarves outside New Street station chanting unconvincingly about much how they hate Geordies to the pre-match light show featuring the local rapper Jaykae.View image in fullscreenTomoki Iwata (left) scores a spectacular second goal for Birmingham.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PASuitably whipped up, Birmingham were ahead within 43 seconds against a Newcastle side that featured only two players who had started Wednesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final win over Arsenal, Laird lashing in after Kieran Dowell’s corner had been headed back across goal by Keshi Anderson. For 20 minutes, Birmingham dominated and, had Nick Pope not made a fine save to keep out an Anderson volley, there might not have been a way back. “I thought we did well to navigate the early part of the game,” said Eddie Howe.But William Osula’s surges down the right always offered hope and contributed to two goals in the space of four minutes. After Willock’s controversial equaliser, Callum Wilson, boot raised to shoulder height, nudged in from even closer range after Osula, two yards out in front of an open goal, had somehow smacked the ball into the back of his standing leg.“He was in the right place at the right time,” said Howe. “I don’t see a huge number of players in world football who can do what Callum does. His movement and game management are second to none.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Newcastle never looked entirely comfortable, but ultimately they did find the winner, Willock pouncing to drill Sean Longstaff’s cross-cum-shot between the legs of Peacock-Farrell on 82 minutes. Birmingham, as Davies acknowledged, had just begun to tire, and while Willock’s run was not picked up, that does not at all detract from the quickness of the instincts or the sharpness of the finish.“I think he’s such a talented lad,” said Howe, who was delighted by how Willock had adapted to a more advanced role. “I really want to see him back to his best. It’s been a stop-start season. He’s got the running capacity to play in that position and play in those one-v-one actions.”It wasn’t Newcastle’s best performance but, given the changes, it was never likely to be: this was about getting the job done – and they did that.Explore more on these topicsFA CupThe ObserverBirmingham CityNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

No need for Pep Guardiola to worry about being sacked in the morning, as the home fans seemed convinced would indeed be the case. But Orient were exceptionally good here against the champions of England, and not in a spirit-and-sweat kind of way, but organised, clever on the ball and equal partners in an excellent Cup tie.Afterwards Guardiola seemed to relish both the win and the occasion. “We didn’t grow up playing at Wembley, we are born in these places, in these locker rooms,” City’s manager said. “I know it’s not the perfect conditions, but this is the FA Cup, any team has the right to fight against top teams.”Brisbane Road had been a boisterous, excitingly misty place at kick-off, packed to its 9,000 capacity. The last time these two teams played was two months before England won the World Cup. Orient’s all-time record buy is £200,000. But City still came here needing a win, and it filtered through into a fine lunchtime game.Guardiola made nine changes from the team thatlay down and waggled its legs in the airagainst Arsenal. Vitor Reis made his debut but was hooked at half-time. Nico González made his City debut in the key role of Rodri vacuum-filler but lasted only a quarter of the game before going off injured.Orient were unafraid from the first whistle, playing on the break and pushing hard down the left flank. After which the game settled into a pattern of calm, surgical City possession. Ilkay Gündogan air-kicked in front of goal, a startled prod after the ball trickled right across the box to get to him.But Orient were also sharp and focused in their attacks. Their first chance came on 14 minutes, the excellent Charlie Kelman haring away from City’s high line, but unable to find the right angle, his shot blocked by Stefan Ortega.Then with 16 minutes gone something wild happened. The ball was punted upfield from the left-back channel. González took possession in central midfield, but was robbed by Ethan Galbraith. The ball ran loose.

From there it bounced back out, hit City’s goalkeeper, and bounced back in. Brisbane Road went nuts, bodies tumbling in the stands. As Guardiola said: “When you see this you just have to congratulate the guy.”It was a big moment for González too on his debut, who injured his back in the leadup and was subbed off, replaced by Bernardo Silva. He could be back for Real Madrid in midweek according to his manager. For now, welcome to the pyramid. How was it for you?City pressed hard in waves, although often there was a sense of a team undecided which route to take while walking the ball into the net. Donley cleared a Silva shot off the line. Jack Grealish took the ball in space in the area at one point, coiled for shot, then passed backwards, which will at least help with the completion metrics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sonny Perkins shot just over after a surge down the left, another case of League One players preying on City’s high line with surprising ease. In stoppage time before the break Josh Keeley made a wonderful save, finding exactly the right spot to spread himself and block Omar Marmoush’s close-range finish with his legs and raised arm.Half-time arrived with a mild sense of disbelief around the ground. City kicked off after the break with a totally rejigged back three of Abdukodir Khusanov, John Stones and Nico O’Reilly. And Keeley continued to act as a one-man lime-green wall, saving from Marmoush, through on goal, with his face. But City equalised on 56 minutes. It came from a quickly taken corner, Grealish funnelling the ball to Rico Lewis, whose shot was deflected in off the back of the crouching Khusanov.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Orient almost struck back straight away, a set piece from the left deflected just past the post.Kelman made another half chance for himself, his powerful shot saved by Ortega.

Cup ties have been played at this famous old stadium for 132 years. There will never be another.Andoni Iraola’s tireless, intelligent team tormentedEvertononce again. After the dramatic comeback here in August and last month’s win at the Vitality Stadium, the final act for Sean Dyche, Bournemouth made it a hat-trick of victories over Everton this season to advance into the fifth round. The final FA Cup act for Goodison centred on two first-half mistakes from James Tarkowski, who conceded a penalty scored by the impressive Antoine Semenyo and lost possession for Daniel Jebbison’s strike. David Moyes’s side reacted strongly in the second half but hit a post three times and had another attempt cleared off the line.Jack Clarke stars as Ipswich send Frank Lampard’s Coventry packing in FA CupRead more“It’s not our day when it goes like that,” rued the Everton manager. “At least we showed bit of gumption in the second half and tried to get ourselves back into the game but we conceded two terrible goals.” Moyes put the Goodison angle into perspective. “Real Evertonians who have watched the club over many years will have seen great teams who got to finals and won trophies. They will remember them and not today.”The tie was a subdued, scrappy affair until a combination of Bournemouth’s polished approach play and Tarkowski’s leaden feet gave the visitors a penalty. Milos Kerkez, the Hungary left-back linked with a move to Liverpool, released Semenyo behind a static Everton defence with a lovely cushioned volley from Dean Huijsen’s long ball. The powerful forward advanced into the area where he was unceremoniously upended by Tarkowski’s foul. Semenyo picked himself up to convert a blatant penalty into Jordan Pickford’s bottom corner. Pickford went the right way but was beaten by the pace of Semenyo’s spot-kick.Tarkowski’s second costly mistake arrived shortly before the interval when, under no pressure after receiving a Pickford goal-kick, he pinged a pass straight to Marcus Tavernier. The Bournemouth winger’s shot deflected into the path of Jebbison, who bundled the ball past the Everton goalkeeper at the second attempt.View image in fullscreenJames Tarkowski fouls Antoine Semenyo to concede a penalty.Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersEverton had been careless in possession, culpable for their own downfall and unable to keep their feet at times, with Idrissa Gueye and Jesper Lindstrøm repeatedly slipping over. Even so, the boos that followed them down the tunnel at half-time – admittedly from a minority of the home crowd – were ridiculous. Rebuilding a connection between the team and fans is a priority for Moyes and, as he said before the game, key to players being able to perform with freedom. They were applauded off at full time, in fairness.The hosts’ improved considerably after the restart, performing with the intensity and positivity that had been absent before the break. The introduction of recent loan signing Carlos Alcaraz was a major factor, but there would be no reward. The frame of Kepa Arrizabalaga’s goal saw to that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The central defender just failed to connect with a James Garner corner that flew across the Bournemouth six-yard box. Alcaraz, fouled 25 yards from goal after a surging run from midfield, swept the resulting free-kick against a post with Arrizabalaga rooted to the spot. Iliman Ndiaye flicked an Ashley Young corner towards goal only for Semenyo to head off the line. Alcaraz kept the pressure on, fellow substitute Jack Harrison crossed to the back post and Jake O’Brien headed against the woodwork from two yards out. Another Harrison cross then sailed over the Bournemouth defence, hit the inside of the same post and rebounded into the grateful arms of the visiting keeper. The three attempts against the woodwork and Semenyo’s clearance were condensed into the space of five minutes.At the other end Pickford saved from substitute Justin Kluivert and at close range from Semenyo as Bournemouth looked to punish Everton on the counterattack. They had already inflicted enough. “This competition is not just about how you play, it is about soul, it is about belief and the willingness to sacrifice whatever is needed to go to the next round,” said a satisfied Iraola. “I trust we have that even in a young team.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupThe ObserverEvertonBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Now it is about retaining that status, although McKenna can evidently trust his second string on this evidence, even in all pink, for Cup duties.George Hirst opened the scoring, from a penalty earned after 20 seconds, and Jaden Philogene claimed his first goal for the club after his £20m transfer from Aston Villa. But it was Clarke, who signed from Sunderland for an initial £15m late in the summer transfer window, who took star billing with his second double in the competition and overall display.“The goals will be a boost for him, but I’ve got no doubt about Jack’s qualities,” McKenna, the Ipswich manager, said. “He’s shown it in training and his understanding of … the position, how he can affect a game, the demands of our group … is really growing.“You can’t underestimate the jump for someone like Jack – and we’ve got a few players in that category – arriving late in the transfer window into a new group, never played in the Premier League, joining a club that haven’t been in the Premier League for 22 years. Trying to settle into the toughest league in the world as an attacking player is not easy.“We know how talented he is as a player who signed for now and for the future. I’m sure he’s going to keep improving and today was not a big surprise to me.”View image in fullscreenIpswich’s Jack Taylor (left) and Coventry’s Josh Eccles vie for the ball.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersWhile Ipswich were humiliated by Maidstone United last year but gained promotion, Coventry knocked the non-league side out in the next round and went all the way to an epic Wembley semi-final shootout defeat by Manchester United. But their league form dropped off so much that Mark Robins, a legendary figure in these parts for leading the club from League Two to the lip of the Premier League in 2023,left in November. What price cup glory?Coventry had won four successive league games to move to within three points of the playoff zone, before the harsh reality check of defeats here this past week to Leeds, the Championship leaders, and now Ipswich. “I think there’s a lot of context at this game,” said Lampard. “Ipswich were absolutely fantastic last year and go and bring a lot of new players in to compete in the Premier League, which is a gap. So they’re going to have that squad [and] they can make changes. [Then] they played last weekend; we played on Wednesday night and we’ll play on Tuesday night.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So Ipswich can claim the Cup glory, albeit with their first team rested up for next Saturday’s game with Aston Villa, while Coventry must pick themselves up for Tuesday’s visit from QPR.

The tournament is now wide open with three rounds to play and Steve Borthwick believes there is more to come from his squad.The hosts were behind entering the final two minutes, only for Elliot Daly to deliver the game’s decisive try and Fin Smith to add the conversion that sealed only England’s second win in their last eight Tests. Itoje, the captain, hailed the victory as “a vindication” of his side’s hard work under Borthwick and praised their determination to keep attacking right to the end.England stun France as dramatic late Daly try clinches Six Nations classicRead more“Steve told the group to be ambitious and brave and to go out and score tries,” Itoje said. “Our backs were incredibly brave and ambitious and they took their opportunities where on other days we might have taken the conservative option.“The ambition and mindset was to go after the win. We knew we needed a score and credit to the boys. They were brave and were wanting to go after France. I’m very happy we were able to do it.”Borthwick also hailed the impact of his bench after a succession of games in which England had faded in the final quarter. “The difference today was the experience that came on,” the head coach said. “Jamie George and Elliot Daly increased our caps by about 170 and increased our average age by a few years. They brought all that intelligence and experience on to the grass.“I am delighted for the players because everyone wants that tangible reward. I’m also happy for our supporters. Hopefully they’re filling up the pubs of south-west London, having a good time and jumping up and down on sofas all across England. I thought the atmosphere was exceptional and the Test was a great spectacle for everybody, whether you are a France supporter or an English supporter or a neutral. We scored four tries against a very good defence. France are such a good team.”England’s next fixture is at home against Scotland on Saturday week and Borthwick says his team, calmly marshalled by Fin Smith at fly-half, still have plenty of improvement in them. “I was really pleased watching the composure at the end. It’s a team that’s growing. We’d all like everything to just suddenly be perfect. But that’s not the way teams build. The ceiling for this team is very high [but] unfortunately you take some pain along the way.”France’s defence coach, Shaun Edwards, was left to bemoan the costly number of potential tries squandered by the visitors. “We got the oopsies, didn’t we?” Edwards said. “Every time we got near the tryline we seemed to just drop the ball. I’ve never seen that happen before. The French lads are normally magnificent handlers of a rugby ball.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was reportedly rejected by the Welsh Rugby Union’s chief executive, Abi Tierney. Wales have not won a game since.When asked by the BBC why his team yet again failed to deliver, Gatland cited poor discipline and a lack of potency in attack. “It’s very frustrating,” he said. “We shot ourselves in the foot with the penalty count being 14-4. I know we got a few [penalties] at the end. We missed a couple of opportunities that we created and couldn’t finish off. So yeah, very frustrating.“I think we’ve been pretty clear on the messaging with the players. But when you look back at the replays and just think, [there were] a couple of soft penalties that were given away, a couple of kick chases were high [in contact], our scrum wasn’t as effective as it needed to be. But we created a few opportunities. We were also unlucky. Josh Adams had a couple of chances. So look, it’s very disappointing.“I think we’ve just got to be honest with ourselves. Some of the mistakes we made as a group, we have to focus on fixing those things. In a game like tonight, in those weather conditions, you’ve got to be as accurate as you possibly can. That means your discipline becomes really relevant, your kicking game and kicking to compete [become more important]. And then looking to take opportunities. They kept the scoreboard ticking over with the penalties.”On the future of Welsh rugby, Gatland was more upbeat, saying: “Hopefully there is an agreement with the union and the regions and I think its positive. We talked about the pathways and that is a plan for us going into 2027 and ’29. Hopefully that is implemented as soon as possible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet emails firstreportedon Monday morning by the Guardian, its reporting partner WWL Louisiana, the Associated Press and the New York Times establish how the Saints – owned by the devout New Orleans Catholic Gayle Benson – and team executives were far more involved in helping its local archdiocese spin media coverage of the abuse scandal than the organizations had previously acknowledged.The Saints and New Orleans’ archdiocese have each characterized the correspondence between them as well-intended public relations help that has been misconstrued by journalists.‘Crisis communications’: emails show how NFL’s Saints and NBA’s Pelicans helped New Orleans church spin abuse scandalRead moreNonetheless, Snap’s statement said the Saints “used their vast resources” as an NFL franchise “to support an organization that is accused of covering up sexual assault on innocent boys and girls”. The accusations to which Snap referred are contained in a sworn law enforcement statement filed in New Orleans’ criminal courthouse last April as part of a joint state and federal child sex-trafficking investigation focused on the archdiocese, which isallegedto have allowed clergymen to inflict sexual abuse on minors for decades and then successfully covered up most of those crimes.“TheNew Orleans Saints, the Catholic church, and every institution wielding influence over our communities must do more than protect their own reputations,” said a statement attributed to Letitia Peyton, the executive director of the clergy-abuse survivor support group TentMakers of Louisiana and the leader of Snap’s chapter in the state. “Prioritizing [public relations] over survivors perpetuates harm.”At a media briefing on Monday afternoon six days before New Orleans hosts Super Bowl LIX, the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell,hailedBenson and the Saints’ top brass as “great corporate citizens” when asked if the league would investigate the team’s use of its servers and logo in the emails with the church.“I’m confident that they are playing nothing more than a supportive role to help be more transparent in circumstances like this,” Goodell said of the Saints, who hadfoughtin court to keep the emails out of public view.Benson also owns the NBA’sNew Orleans Pelicans. The NBA – whose logo is also in the communications – has not responded to multiple requests for comment about the emails.In his own statement, the Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse (SCSA) founder Richard Windmann dismissed Goodell’s statement about the Saints and Pelicans emails with the church as “frivolous” and “avoiding the true issue”.“If the NFL has policies towards … sex abuse as they advertise publicly, we have not seen any action on them,” Windmann said. “Actually addressing this issue head-on would be a much better measure to maintain their reputations than using their PR teams to spin the story.”Snap, meanwhile, contended that Goodell “should use the power of his office to open an independent, thorough investigation into these disturbing revelations”.“We urge him to immediately undertake a probe of the New Orleans Saints, and when completed to make his findings public,” the Snap statement said.Explore more on these topicsNew Orleans clergy abuseNew Orleans SaintsNew Orleans PelicansCatholicismUS sportsNew OrleansLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

A regular at games since 1983, Matt Black cheered on KC through very little thick and and a whole lot of thin, an era marked mostly by a series of sports tragedies overseen by then head coach Marty Schottenheimer. Then, on one ordinary day in 2018, Black decided to shave his customary goatee leaving behind a mustache. He gazed into his bathroom mirror, and suddenly it wasn’t Black, a professional opera singer by trade, looking back at him. Instead, it was Chiefs head coach Andy Reid.“It was purely by accident,” Black told the Guardian via video chat, while donned in full Chiefs regalia, sitting in front of a press conference backdrop that would fool just about anyone into thinking you were speaking to the HC himself. “I had no idea that I looked similar to coach Andy Reid. My wife had booked some tickets for us for a Halloween ball and everybody started coming up to me taking pictures. And I thought, ‘Well, that’s interesting.’”View image in fullscreenMatt Black, aka Almost Andy Reid speaking to The GuardianPhotograph: David Lengel, via video chat/The GuardianBlack had transformed into his alias, “Almost Andy”, and at just the right time. Three titles and fourSuper Bowlappearances later, his life has changed in ways he couldn’t possibly have imagined. The “halo effect” that has been bestowed onto Black (and more on him in a moment), has also dramatically sweetened the status of KC, a middle-American city of 510,000 residents that forms the seventh smallest--television market amongst NFL teams.“What this run means to Kansas City is that we’re on a global platform,” KC mayor Quinton Lucas told the Guardian. “A year ago I was in Parisand had the chance to visit with [French national sports daily] L’Equipe, and they said, wow, ‘Patrick Mahomes, tell us about him. Tell us about Kansas City.’ I’ll be going down to New Orleans. You go there to interact with lots of people around the country and the world who make very big decisions. And so to me, this is why this is so special. This is why, you know, you try to take advantage of it and you realize that this is a unique opportunity to have this ongoing success for a Midwestern city that isn’t always thought about.”Kansas City wasn’t thought about in 1994 when host cities for the Fifa World Cup were selected, and while we can’t say for sure that the Chiefs putting KC on the global map is directly responsible for theirlanding 2026 World Cup games, the city’s enhanced profile couldn’t have hurt. Neither has the estimated $500m of direct benefit the mayor says came just from home playoff games during the run.Then there’s the unlikely ascent of the city’s television and film industry. Kansas City will never be confused with Hollywood, but it’s always had its share of feature film and commercial productions roll into town. Now thanks to the Chiefs and their quarterback, local crews benefit from an annual spring and summer ramp up that takes the industry to a different level.We call it Patrick season,” KC Film Office director Rachel Kephart told said. “We will film several of his national commercials in Kansas City and some of them are hiring up to 150 people … and it’s pretty special that he chooses to film his projects here. I would imagine he could film them wherever he wanted, but he’s always filmed them here. So we’re really grateful for it.”Kansas City film and television production crew members have a lot to thank Patrick Mahomes for.As American NFL audiences know full well, you absolutely can not miss Mahomes plugging a certainred-branded insurance company, or a blue shampoo or a pink phone company. Though they may have missed theHallmark Christmas film, centered around, you guessed it, a Kansas City Chiefs fan – Mahomes sat that one out. Even the Chiefs themselves are getting into the business, announcing theirnew production studiothis week.As for Black, aka, Almost Andy, he has to be one of the most improbable beneficiaries of the Chiefs’ success. He’s also landed on film sets, where he cozies up to KC’s football celebs as a stand-in for Andy Reid.“He was sitting there chatting with me one time, he says, ‘yeah, I get texts all the time from even my family members that say, hey, we saw you out at such and such a place.’ He’s like, nope, that wasn’t me.”Black has perfected the look on and off the field, donning Reid’s traditional threads, mimicking his gait, and impersonating his voice, which he claims has actually helped his on-stage baritone operatic voice.“I never, ever try to trick anybody. I walk on a plane, they just think that Andy’s there and the pilots and people will come up to me and thank me and stuff. But sometimes they just won’t listen. I can’t convince them otherwise.”View image in fullscreenMatt Black, aka Andy Reid, flashing his bling.Photograph: Unknown/Moxie Talent AgencyMatt’s head turning is more than just a party trick, it’s a living, or at least a pretty good side hustle. On Friday, Almost Andy was in Los Angeles, filming a Super Bowl segment for Fox, who are broadcasting the big game in the US. Then he’ll make the flight down to New Orleans, where he’ll be making a series of television appearances: so far ABC’s Good Morning America, NBC’s The Tonight Show and the BBC have made inquiries. He has over600k followers on social media,his own local endorsements and is currently ranked34th overall on Cameo, spending some two hours a night recording messages.Nothing can stop Almost Andy, except perhaps coach Reid’s recent weight loss.“That’s been a little bit of a challenge for me. I keep sending dozens of donuts out there. I don’t know what he’s up to, but he’s not following what I send because he’s been putting off the weight. So I got to take care of that.”When asked for a prediction forSuper Bowl LIX, Almost Andy was careful not to provide the Eagles with any bulletin board material.“All we need to do is get out there and focus on the job at hand,” he says. “And that’s what we’re going to do as a team.”Thanks, coach.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlNFLKansas City ChiefsUS sportsPatrick MahomesPhiladelphia EaglesSuper Bowl LIXfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first is the global icon and beloved royal family member, Diana, Princess of Wales. The other is a high school girls’ field hockey coach in Lower Merion, Pennsylvania. Both were reluctantly pulled into the spotlight by their husbands’ fame.Bothhaverockeda Philadelphia Eagles letterman jacket. But Kylie Kelce, the 32-year-old wife of the former Eagles centerJason Kelce, is the only princess of the two to figure out how to freely divulge what she wants to the people about motherhood, relationships and media.“If you’re gonna talk about our family, if you’re gonna talk about me, you might as well hear it from me,” Kelce declared in the inaugural episode of her podcast Not Gonna Lie (NGL), which launched this past December. Kelce’s impetus to podcast isn’t hollow:a lot of peoplearetalking about her. Through a fortuitous blend of athleticism (Jason is one of the most celebrated offensive lineman in recent NFL history; his brotherTravis Kelcehas similar bragging rights as tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs) and charisma (Jason’s 2018speechat the Super Bowl parade cemented him as a Philadelphia folk hero;Travis’s girlfriend, a little-known performer by the name of Taylor Swift, has only boosted his appeal), the Kelce boys have garnered a lot of old-fashioned goodwill from the American public.Chiefs v Eagles Super Bowl questions: when’s kickoff? Who is the halftime performer? Are Taylor and Trump going?Read moreIn 2023, theycompeted against each otherin the Super Bowl, and Kylie Kelce, 38 weeks pregnant with her third daughter, brought along her obstetrician in case she went into labor mid-game. It inspired a steady drumbeat of tabloid coverage since – abouther pregnancies,her miscarriage,her mothering styleandher marriage. Between Jason and Travis’s New Heights podcast, Jason’s ESPN talkshow, a Kelce documentary on Prime, a Kelce Christmas duet with Stevie Nicks, at least a dozen brand deals among them all and another Chiefs/Eagles matchup forSuper Bowl 2025(Jason retired in 2024), the Kelce ascendancy continues. Little did Kylie know that when she swiped right on Jason on Tinder in 2015, she’d end up part of an American dynasty.Still, when NGL skyrocketed to the top of Spotify and Apple podcast charts within two weeks of its debut and temporarily knockedJoe Roganfrom his throne, it caused tumult in the digital town square. That a suburban mom and wife, who has said her politics“aggressively lean” left, was able to unseat the pugnacious prince of the manosphere promptedskeptics to ask, both genuinely and crudely: “Who the fuck is Kylie Kelce?”But NGL v Joe Rogan Experience is an ill-suited comparison, and one that Kelce herself is decidedly not interested in making. “I couldn’t care less about the charts,” shetoldthe New York Times in a December profile, and besides, Rogan’s male listenership isn’t who she’s courting. Instead, a more interesting dynamic is unfolding in two spaces where Kelce has home-field advantage: female sports media and motherhood content. What’s more, she’s forging ahead with a tactic not common in the high-octane arena of podcasting: by being, it seems, the most normal woman in the world.View image in fullscreenJason and Kylie Kelce in 2023.Photograph: Cooper Neill/Getty ImagesOn NGL, Kelce introduces herself as a “soon-to-be mom of four” – the Kelce dynasty continues to expand – and a former field hockey player turned coach. “I have a husband that you might know about. He sort of, let’s be real, dragged me into this mess,” she says. Episodes of NGL are capped at 45 minutes to cater to an audience of moms and working women (even Mel Robbins’s clocks in at about an hour and a half). They feature segments like the self-deprecating “Places I have no business being” (Milan fashion week! A WWE event!) and “Five-ish questions” (“We’re not doing 20 questions. We’re doing five-ish questions, that’s what we have time for”). Nine episodes in, all of Kelce’s guest interviewees have been women and, more often than not, women in sports.“She seems very real, like a real, real person,” said Sara Isenhour, 40, a stay-at-home mother of three from Tennessee. Isenhour, who particularly loves NGL’s “Fuck around and find out” segment, calls Kelce “hilarious” and thinks she “has a very real take on motherhood”.Lee Wacker, 34, a philanthropy officer from Philadelphia, likes that Kelce is “seemingly not self-involved and is making herself open to these experiences in an accessible, everywoman sort of way.” Wacker, noting Kelce’s philanthropic work in the community, also pointed out thatfanshavecrownedher the “people’s princess of Philadelphia”.For the most part, Kelce’s Instagram feed doesn’t show the heavy hand of a PR team; she favors posts of the Jersey Shore, her dogs and kids, and her #mcm Jason. Bulk orders of paper towels are piled up throughout the Kelce home in the Philly suburbs, less than 10 miles from where Kelce grew up and went to college. Rarely dressed more formally than anyone you’d bump into running errands at Target, Kelce is undoubtedly one with the people. It turns out, the people love that.After launching at No 1 on Spotify and Apple’s top podcast charts, NGL, produced by Wave Sports and Entertainment, now sits at 47 and 37 respectively, outranking Travis and Jason’s show;NGL’s YouTube pagehas more than 250,000 followers.Wacker and Isenhour both say that Kelce’s championing of women in sports has kept them tuning in. “I connect most closely to the women in sports dynamic, or women interested in men’s sports, [with] these echoes of other worlds,” Wacker said. “That’s been what’s sustained my interest.” Kelce recently played host toAlex Morganfor an episode in which they talked about playing soccer during and after pregnancy, achieving equal pay for the US Women’s National Soccer Team, and the difficulty of choosing baby names. Wacker recalled her reaction to the episode: “Ding, ding, ding, that’s right on the target of what I was hoping we would see.”NGL’s arrival has coincided with ameteoric risein national interest in women’s sports, with sports’ female fandom in generalgrowingas well. Still, scroll through Spotify and Apple’s sports podcasts and it’s a sea of male hosts in baseball caps, baring their teeth for cover photos one can only presume were taken mid-verbal dunk. The handful of women-hosted or women-focused sports shows – and there are some! – have yet to become mainstays.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right: Sheinelle Jones, Ryan Hammond and Kylie Kelce in 2024.Photograph: NBC/Nathan Congleton/Getty Images“We all grew up in a world where, if you liked sports, it was a ‘name five players’ type deal,” said Lily Shimbashi, founder of Sports.ish, a company aiming to reshape sports media to be more inclusive of female athletes and fans. One of Shimbashi’s first jobs was as an NBA broadcast associate, and she said she picked up on hostility from male fans. “I wasn’t sure, as a very young woman embarking on my career, if I wanted to be judged by men on their couches for the rest of my life,” she said.In 2019, when Shimbashi started out, an estimated 5% of sports media was dedicated to covering women’s sports. Butresearchsuggests that surging interest could see that percentage rise to 20% in 2025, with NGL, though not explicitly a sports podcast, part of that landscape.Along with Morgan, Kelce has brought on the Fox Sports commentator Charissa Thompson to discuss her decision to not have children, the NFL sportscaster Erin Andrews to discuss her journey to parenthood through surrogacy after cervical cancer, and the Olympic sprinter Gabby Thomas to talk about imposter syndrome as an elite athlete. (Non-sports guests have included the social media personality Drew Afualo and the It’s Always Sunny inPhiladelphiaactor Kaitlin Olson.) According to Shimbashi, these are the interviews that give a female fanbase the “connection and emotional vulnerability” they crave. They offer a path into the sports world that doesn’t require them to obsessively recite stats or pass “name five players” tests.She is standing here admitting: ‘My child was throwing up yesterday.’Kelce claims she has “no business” talking to these women – a self-effacing sentiment that I don’t necessarily agree with – and is still honing her somewhat stiff interviewing skills. But her deep familiarity with the demands sports can make on women and families and a sporting attitude towards her guests allows conversations to flow. (As NGL has progressed, so has her ease with conducting interviews.)“A real key thing to growing the popularity and the fanbase of women’s sports is to have women’s sports just talked about in general culture and in mainstream media. And Kylie is doing that,” said Caroline Fitzgerald, the founder and CEO of Goals, a consultancy and media platform focused on the business side of women’s sports.If Kelce isn’t talking about sports on NGL, there’s a good chance she’s talking about motherhood. At the moment, the momfluencing arena is dominated bytrad wiveslike Hannah Neeleman of Ballerina Farm, who showcases an aesthetically aspirational lifestyle of tending to her rural Utah farm while raising eight children under 12, and Nara Smith, who can make chewing gum from scratch while wearing a silk chiffon blouse. These women make motherhood look selfless, virtuous and very, very beautiful. Kelce, while also a conventionally attractive woman, has no qualms discussing the uglier, messier side of parenting.She jokes about how mortifying it is to be driving a minivan, and how she fears her children will realize how lazy she is when it comes to Elf on the Shelf placement. In the podcast’s fifth episode, I was pleasantly surprised to hear congestion in her voice. “We’re a little under the weather in our house this week,” she announced through a cough. It’s a phrase I’ve heard mothers in my life say more times than I can count.“There are so many opinions about the right way to parent, so many pieces of advice for young moms on sleeping, on eating, on growth development, and it’s exhausting,” Shimbashi, who is also a mother, said. “To have a woman with Kylie’s influence come in and say: ‘Hey, being a mom is hard. My house isn’t clean ever’ – and this is a woman who has access to a lot of help and has access to a lot of childcare – but she is standing here admitting: ‘My child was throwing up yesterday.’”In general, Kelce presumes a millennial mama bear equanimity – a self-assuredness, rather than a stringent allegiance to traditional values or perceived morality to guide her parenting style. Yes, she curses in front of her kids. No, she’s not too concerned this is what’ll send them down a path of depravity. “I know a lot of people do a lot to prepare for having a child, including educational avenues,” Kelce said on a recent NGL episode. “Reading books, taking birth classes. I didn’t do any of it.” But before anyone could possibly accuse her of mom-shaming, she continued: “Good on ya. It’s not me.”Shimbashi also noted Kelce’s position as an athlete’s spouse. Athletes’ wives and girlfriends, or Wags, “were known as elite, they wore high fashion, they were untouchable”, she said. But she finds Kelce to be “relatable as a wife”. “No marriage is perfect and [Kylie and Jason’s] certainly isn’t, but it feels very real,” she said.“She seems so adjusted and so normal, for lack of a better word, compared to the tropes of football wives and girlfriends,” Wacker said. She doesn’t posture her “children as an accessory to a personified image of marital harmony, supporting your football player husband”.To hear her fans say it, Kelce is the platonic ideal of a friendly neighbor. She offers a familiar camaraderie that isn’t overly intimate (she loves her boundaries), and no woman will be made to feel inadequate in her presence; she’s someone to gripe with, whose voting record you don’t necessarily need to be concerned about, who can get into it about Sunday’s game. Consistently true to who she is, who she is is normal.Time will tell if Kelce’s normalcy will give way to monotony, or whether her growing fame will break the illusion. For now, for 45 minutes a week at least, folks are hooked.Explore more on these topicsUS newsPodcastingNFLUS sportsParents and parentingFamilyTravis KelcefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gambling revenue hit $99.4bn in 2022,accordingto the American Gaming Association (AGA), the industry lobby group.‘A serious disease’: Congress weighs federal gambling crackdown amid growing concernsRead moreSuper Bowl Sunday – the biggest sports event of the year – will be no exception. Even as TV networks have struggled to maintain audience numbers, with more people tuning in to video content online, the Super Bowl has continued to grow in viewership. In 2024, arecord123 million viewers tuned into the game, making it themost-watched telecastin history.The AGA estimated that $1.39bn worth of legal bets will be placed for Super Bowl LIX. This is the first year the trade association reported estimated bets solely from legal channels. In previous years, AGA relied on surveys that included all betting, including those placed illegally and casually among friends. Last year, research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gamingestimated$1.25bn of legal bets were placed for the Super Bowl last year.“No single event unites sports fans like the Super Bowl, and that excitement extends to sports betting, with this year’s record legal handle reflecting its widespread appeal,” said Bill Miller, the AGA president and CEO, in astatement.But as more Americans have wagered bets, and placing bets has become easier than ever, addiction experts and prevention advocates have warned about rising rates of gambling addiction.As gambling addiction rates rise, keep an eye on grandma this Super Bowl | Edith LangfordRead moreThere are an estimated 2.5 million adults in the US who meet the criteria for having a severe gambling problem, meaning their gambling behavior is damaging their life, relationships and career, according to theNational Council on Problem Gambling. Another 5 to 8 million Americans have mild to moderate gambling problems. Multiple problem gambling groups have reported an uptick in calls to gambling addiction hotlines after states legalized sports betting.Big game days such as theSuper Bowlare especially concerning for those who may be susceptible to problem gambling because the stakes are often higher.“For a person who has a gambling problem … they’ve been betting on games all season long, and they may have lost a lot of money, and the Super Bowl becomes kind of the ‘this is it, I’m going to make it or I’m going to break it’,” Rose Blocinski, executive director of Wisconsin Council of Problem Gambling,toldlocal news state WJFW.For Dr Tim Fong, a clinical professor of psychology and co-director of theGamblingStudies Program at the University of California at Los Angeles who studies gambling addiction, events including the Super Bowl can exacerbate potential addiction for those who are only in the early stages of problems.“By the time you see guys like me, things are really, really severe. What I’m worried about after this weekend: someone takes a bad loss, it hurts them financially. What are they going to donextweekend, after the Super Bowl?” Fong said. “Are they going to say, ‘You know what, I’m not going to do this again’, then just live their life? Or are they going to chase their losses and now bet on the NBA? And then bet on Major League Baseball in a month or so?“We can reduce the number of problems if we did more at an earlier stage,” Fong added.The Super Bowl and gambling are locked in a tight and dangerous embraceRead moreBetting companies have also become more aggressive at advertising. Last year, BetMGM, the sports betting arm of MGM Resorts, aired a star-studdedcommercialpromoting its platform during the Super Bowl. Fong said that it has all contributed to a normalizing of sports betting in American culture.Kids are seeing that “in America, this is just a part of what we do. There’s no questioning that this is harmful, this is dangerous, there’s a dark side to this. For the vast majority of people that bet on sports, it’s fun, it’s entertainment, it’s not damaging in any way,” Fong said. “But for the 1-2% that have this addiction, it’s really devastating.”Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LIXThe big betSport bettingSuper BowlGamblingUS sportsNFLnewsShareReuse this content"

Carrying out this hostile takeover are a team of staffers made up of wealthy executives, far-right ideologues and young engineers that have come to make up “Doge”.At government institutions such as the treasury department, General Services Administration andUnited States Agency for International Development, Musk’s allies havegained access to computer systems, including the sensitive personal data and payment information of tens of millions of Americans. His team is working toshut down USAid, the world’s largest single supplier of humanitarian aid, and members have been spotted at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Education and National Institutes of Health.To undertake this unprecedented andpotentially illegalguttingof public funding, Musk has assembled loyalists who largely lack government experience and who range from tech elites to Maga diehards, according to a review of the people publicly associated with Doge.Doge has not released any detailed account of who is working at the unofficial agency, and Musk, along with other staff, is technically a “special government employee”, which allows him and others to evade ethics and financial disclosures that would normally apply to government workers. The Doge team has taken steps to avoid public scrutiny, including limiting their online footprints.Doge v USAid: how Elon Musk helped his acolytes infiltrate world’s biggest aid agencyRead moreA lawsuit filed by unions of federal workers alleges that Musk’s allies in Doge have held calls and interviews in which they have withheld their last names in an effort to escape media scrutiny. These interviewers have also allegedly refused to answer questions while talking to federal employees.Musk shared a letter on X sent to him from the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor for Washington DC that vowed to pursue “any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people”, which includes identifying them.As hundreds of employees were put on administrative leave at USAid, several sources told the Guardian that Musk was directing Doge’s day-to-day operations personally.“This was just the Doge dudes just literally on the phone with Musk just getting directions from him,” one USAid employee said.Within the White House, Musk appears to be running Doge with a high degree of independence and with Donald Trump’s backing. The president briefly praised Musk’s team on Monday, although he said that he had not met with them personally.“They work, actually, out of the White House,” Trump said. “They’re smart people.”A Doge spokesperson did not respond to a list of questions concerning its staff and operations.Tech executives and engineers take over major agenciesSeveral people at Doge come directly from Musk’s private companies, including the Boring Company, Tesla and xAI. One executive taking a lead role overseeing the effort, according tomultipleoutlets, is Musk’s longtime lieutenant Steve Davis.Davis has worked for Musk in different capacities for about 20 years and is president of the tunnel-digging Boring Company. He was present on Saturday night at USAid when Doge staffers and agency security officials clashed over Musk’s team’s demands for access to restricted areas, multiple sources told the Guardian. When USAid officials attempted to block the team, two sources said that Davis threatened to bring in US marshals to the agency. The Guardian granted anonymity to those sources to protect them from retaliation.Davis is known for cost cutting and running fast-paced operations, which have at times resulted in clashes with safety regulators. While he was president of Boring in 2023, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) found that15 to 20 Boring employees in Las Vegas had been burnedwith chemical accelerants due to hazardous working conditions at the site. The company’s former safety managertold Fortunethat Davis had undercut and isolated him in ways that prohibited him from doing his job, while former employees said Davis imposed difficult deadlines and encouraged a breakneck pace. One Boring employee emailed the safety manager warning that workers “consistently flirted with death” while in the tunnels,according to Fortune. The Boring Company did not return a request for comment on these allegations.Elon Musk’s Doge staffers face protest over labor department visitRead moreAnother former Musk employee, Amanda Scales, worked at the billionaire’s artificial intelligence startup xAI before becoming chief of staff at the office of personnel management, which functions as the government’s human resources agency. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, the acting head of OPM instructed heads of agencies tosend Scales a list of employeeson probationary periods or administrative leave as the new administration seeks to make drastic cuts to the federal workforce.Allies of the world’s richest man have also been placed in key positions at the General Services Administration – which handles government real estate and federal IT structure – and the treasury department. The former Tesla engineer Thomas Shedd is now in charge of the GSA’s Technology Transformation Services, with404 Media reportingthat Shedd told workers he wants to implant artificial intelligence throughout government systems to write software and automate services. Musk himself has said he wants to deploy AI to review government payments for potential waste.Tom Krause, the CEO of themultibillion-dollar tech company Cloud Software Group, and a Musk ally, is now working within the treasury department. A judgeruled on Thursdaythat he was one of two “special government employees” associated with Doge who can access sensitive treasury data.View image in fullscreenMarc Andreessen.Photograph: Brendan McDermid/ReutersSeveral tech moguls have said they are collaborating with Doge, though it’s not always clear in what capacity. The billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen,who donated $2.5mto a pro-Trump political action committee and celebrated his re-election,told the New York Timeslast month that he was “helping Doge”. Andreessen did not go into detail on what his help entailed and said he was not speaking for Musk, but he appeared to have advance knowledge of Doge’s goals and told the Times it had plans for “the money side”, head count and regulation. Weeks after the interview, Musk’s lieutenants went after the money side of the federal government –the treasury department.In addition to the more established executives working at Doge or collaborating with the group,Wired reportedthat Musk had hired a group of young engineers fresh out of college or high school who possess little experience outside of tiny tech firms. These Doge staffers, who according to the outlet range from 19 to 25 years old, have at times been given huge amounts of access and power over the federal government –including sources telling Wiredthat the engineer Marko Elez had gained direct “write access” to treasury department payment systems.Elez resignedon Thursday afterthe Wall Street Journal askedthe White House about his links to a now-deleted social media account that promoted eugenics and racism. Among other racist posts, the account posted on X that “you could not pay me to marry outside my ethnicity” and called for repealing the Civil Rights Act, according to the Journal. Earlier that day,a judge had grantedElez and one other Doge employee the power to see sensitive treasury department data.Elezwas reinstatedon Friday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has reportedly been on calls with GSA employees as they are asked to defend their jobs.“These people are clueless, given how smart they’re supposed to be,” one USAid employee currently on administrative leave said of the young Doge team. “They’re under the impression that if you just say [to do something], then it will magically happen.”Maga world gets a role in DogeAlong with the staff working with Doge full-time, with some evensleeping in government buildings, Musk’s team has worked in tandem with Trump hardliners to dismantle or exert control over government agencies. Doge staffers showed up to USAid in the past week with Peter Marocco, who briefly served at several agencies during Trump’s first term and was accused bymultiple staffersof poor leadership and toxic workplace behavior.Marocco wasallegedly photographedinside the Capitol building during the January 6 riot, according to a widely cited, citizen-led investigation that has accurately named numerous other rioters. When Dallas’sD Magazine asked himabout the allegations last year, Marocco did not deny them but called the reports “smear tactics”.The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has now tapped Marocco to run USAid and review its programs as Musk continues work to shut down the agency entirely. Current and former USAid stafferstold the Guardian last weekthat Marocco represented a disaster for the agency, with one former official calling him “a destroyer”.“He’s the most unqualified person to be sitting in any seat of government, let alone the person who has the keys to our foreign assistance,” another former colleague at USAid who still works at the agency said.Also working with Doge is the far-right Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is head of a “delivering on government efficiency” group within the House oversight committee. Greene, who has espousednumerous extremist conspiraciesand in 2022spoke at a white nationalist event, has used her power to demand that NPR and PBS testify about their operations. Greene cited a PBS report that stated Musk gave “what appeared to be a fascist salute” during a speech last month as one of the reasons to compel the news outlet’s executives to appear at the hearing.The conservative ideology extends to Doge’s human resources department, where the head of HR is an employment attorney and consultant who has promoted a “non-woke” alternative to diversity, equity and inclusion programs,404 Media reported. Stephanie Holmes told the rightwingFederalist Society in 2022that she started her firm to counter the “really progressive ideology that HR was pushing into corporate America”.The spokesperson for Doge is Katie Miller, who is married to the deputy White House chief of staff, Stephen Miller. Before working at Doge, Miller was Mike Pence’s press secretary and a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, where she defended Trump’s anti-immigration policies, including during the period when it was separating families at the border. During Doge’s takeover of agencies on Sunday, Miller issued a statement on X claiming that no violations of security protocol had taken place. On Wednesday night, she told reporters that Musk would decide for himself when his actions constituted a conflict of interest.Stephen Miller has also begun working closely with Musk in the new Trump administration,according to the New York Times, and on Monday went on Fox News to defend the shutdown of USAid by decrying it as a “swamp nest of bureaucrats”. During Trump’s first term, Miller served as a key policy adviser and pushed for extreme policies such as banning immigration and travel from Muslim-majority countries. In 2019, more than 50 civil rights organizations and 20 Democratic senatorscalled for Miller’s resignationafter it emerged that he hadsent hundreds of emailsto far-right editors at Breitbart that included him citing information from prominent white nationalist websites.Changing staff and hidden identitiesSome of the people who had been associated with Doge in the months before Trump’s official order on 20 January have either been given roles elsewhere in the administration or pushed out entirely. The former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy was originally slated to co-lead Doge with Musk, trumpeting the agency in posts on X. He left afterreportedly facing internal tensionswith the Tesla CEO and announced a run for Ohio governor.The former Trump tech adviser Michael Kratsios was helping interview hires for Doge,according to Bloomberg, but has since been nominated as the president’s science adviser. The top Silicon Valley investment banker and Musk ally Michael Grimes wasalso reportedly in discussionsabout joining Doge. He’snow expectedto join the commerce department.Others hold unclear roles within Musk’s unofficial agency, such as the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Baris Akis, who,the New York Times reported, has become close to Musk and an integral part of Doge in recent weeks. Akis is a Turkish national who does not hold US citizenship,according to the Atlantic, which reported that Trump’s advisers declined Musk’s request to officially hire him because of his immigration status. It is unclear in what capacity, if any, he is still involved in the effort. The Doge spokesperson, Katie Miller, did not respond to a request for comment on whether Akis is still involved in Doge.Government watchdog groups have condemned the lack of transparency around Doge’s operations.“It’s inappropriate for the federal government to purposely hide the identities of senior officials who are shaping the policies and servicing the public,” said Scott Amey, the general counsel of the Project on Government Oversight. “These officials must be held accountable for their work, both by their colleagues and the public. It’s also crucial that these officials abide by ethics and transparency requirements to assure the public they are serving in the best interest of our communities.”Andrew Roth contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now he can move things with his mind. Should we be amazed - or terrified?An accident left Noland Arbaugh paralysed, but Musk’s Neuralink brain implant allows him to control computers with his thoughts. Is it a life-changing innovation that could help millions – or the start of a dystopia where a billionaire can access our thoughts?Jenny KleemanSat 8 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTShareNoland Arbaugh’s life changed in a fraction of a second in June 2016. He was a 22-year-old student, working at a kids’ summer camp in upstate New York, when he went swimming in a lake. He can’t tell me exactly what happened, but thinks one of his friends must have accidentally struck him very hard in the side of his head as they ran into the water and plunged beneath the surface.When he woke up face down in the water, unable to move or breathe, Noland immediately knew he was paralysed. But he didn’t panic. He felt no fear at all, he says. “You never know what you’re going to do in those high-stress situations. I found out that day that it’s hard to shake me. I am very, very calm under pressure.”Elon Musk would ultimately turn this quality to his advantage when, after nearly eight years of being quadriplegic, Noland agreed to allow the world’s richest man to implant an electronic chip into his brain. In January 2024,Noland became the first human recipientof abrain-computer interface (BCI)developed by Musk’s company, Neuralink. If it worked, it would allow him to control a computer using only the power of his mind.Only four months after he first heard about Neuralink, Noland was on an operating table, with a purpose-built robot poised to insert the N1 chip into his motor cortex. The stakes could not have been higher for him: he was risking infection, haemorrhage andbrain damage. “My brain is the last part of myself that I really feel I have control over,” he tells me from his wheelchair at his kitchen table in Yuma, Arizona. But the stakes for humankind, too, were very great: if Neuralink succeeds, the world’s most powerful billionaire will have fulfilled his science-fiction-fuelled dreams of melding minds with machines.What kind of person chooses to be Elon Musk’s guinea pig? And, once the experiment is over, what happens next – for Noland, and for the rest of us?Noland’s world is in a different universe to Musk’s. Now 30, he lives in the same simple, single-storey house in the dusty military town in the Sonoran desert where he grew up. He left for an international studies degree atTexas A&M University, only to move back after his accident so that his mother, Mia, stepfather and half-brother could take care of him. The words “Be grateful for small things, big things and everything in between” are stencilled on the kitchen wall. Goats, chickens and a plump turkey named Hope roam the back yard. Two golden retrievers and an enormous goldendoodle pad around the kitchen, occasionally pushing their noses into my lap.Noland has an electric wheelchair that he can operate using a mouthpiece; his forearms lie still on the brightly upholstered armrests. Every so often, Mia reaches forward to uncurl his fingers, or offer him a sip of coffee from a straw in a Big Gulp cup, or swat away the flies that buzz around his face in the merciless Arizona heat. He asks her to roll up his shirt to show me a sleeve of tattoos on his arm. “I got it done after my accident because it didn’t hurt,” he grins. Two bracelets are inked on to his wrist; a permanent rendering of ones given to him by the girls who pulled him out of the water in 2016.Before his accident, Noland was outdoorsy and athletic, playing football, American football, basketball, rugby and golf. He liked to go hunting and shooting deer with his family. He was musical, too, playing bass in a rock band, and he performed in high school theatre productions. He loved Xbox and PlayStation, but was never really into tech. A shelf next to us is still crammed with the board games he used to play: Settlers of Catan; The Game of Life.Mia worked at their church, and Noland was a student leader there. His faith was a huge part of his life, growing up. “I always wanted to make it through college as a Christian,” he says. “That lasted about a week. I was sleeping around, I was doing drugs, I was drinking a lot.” He sees his accident as divine intervention. “It was God pulling me back. I really do think that it was the best thing that could have happened to me.”View image in fullscreenNoland Arbaugh, with his mother, Mia Neely, at home in Yuma, Arizona.Photograph: Steve Craft/The GuardianThe blow to Noland’s head didn’t break his neck – it dislocated it, and his vertebra went back into place immediately – but it left his spinal cord severely damaged. The higher up a serious spinal cord injury is, the more extensive the paralysis. Superman actor Christopher Reeve shattered his first and second vertebra, and could not hold up his head without assistance. Noland’s injury was around his fourth and fifth vertebrae, so he can move his head and shoulders, and express himself with nods and shrugs, which he often does. He uses the word “luck” a lot. “I was really lucky that I wasn’t ventilated for my entire life,” he says. “I was really lucky that I didn’t have a traumatic brain injury.”At first, there were “a lot of promising signs” that his condition might improve, but he ultimately never recovered much movement. At the beginning of his adult life, he was facing a lifetime of dependency.“I have to rely on my family foreverything: to give me a shower, to help with bowel movements and urination.” Noland was a smoker, and if he wanted a cigarette he would have to ask someone to take him outside, put one in his mouth, light it and get rid of the ash for him. He liked to smoke weed, too (it’s legal in Arizona).“I didn’t like him smoking, but he’s an adult. It was hard,” Mia tells me. She looks over to him. “I’m your mom. Of course, I’m going to give my two cents.”“I’m a grown man,” Noland says. “To have to rely on other people to do it – it really,reallysucked.” He reluctantly gave up a couple of years ago, unable to bear the guilt of exposing his carers to secondhand smoke.“Another thing people take for granted, just being able to text someone privately, is not easy as a quadriplegic. If I want to dictate something, it’s like yelling out to the world what I’m saying …”“‘I love you!’” shouts Mia.“… I just didn’t have a way to build my life privately.”It’s extraordinary, but also totally unremarkable: Noland is using a computer like anyone else; he’s just not moving his body: ‘I forget how impressive it is, because it’s so natural to me’There was an iPad Noland could use. “I’d have a stick that I would hold in my mouth, with a little piece of conductive fabric on the end of it, and I would touch my iPad and use it in that way. I did that for years.” But it was frustrating. He had to be put into the right position by other people. Texting with the mouth stick was very slow, and if Noland wanted to use dictation he had to speak with the stick in his mouth. If it fell out, he’d have to call for help. “It’s not very easy. And then there wasn’t a whole lot I could do on it. I mean – it’s an iPad. You can’t do all the same things you can do on a computer.”He asks Mia to open his laptop in front of him on the kitchen table. He turns towards the screen.“Implant connect,” he says.And he begins to play chess, moving pieces across the board with swift, deft cursor movements, while his hands remain motionless on the armrests of his wheelchair. He’s been playing against some of the Neuralink engineers for a few months, he tells me as he takes someone’s pawn. “None of them are very good, so it’s not too hard.”Next, he’s browsing the internet, opening X, checking his DMs, composing a message by directing his cursor across a virtual keyboard. Now he’s slaying baddies, darting back and forth with a reaper’s scythe in a game called Vampire Survivors. “I love this game,” he says, looking over to me while keeping control of the cursor. He completes a level and digital confetti rains down the screen.It’s extraordinary, but also totally unremarkable: Noland is using a computer like anyone else does; he’s just not moving his body at all. “Sometimes I forget how impressive it is, because it’s so natural to me,” he says, shrugging again.In some respects, Noland isbetterat using a computer than the rest of us. When he first received the Neuralink implant, he tells me, all he wanted to do was play video games. He challenged his friends to a multiplayer version of Civilization VI, called Red Death. “It is absolutely a game of speed, a test of speed. Whoever’s quickest to the draw wins. And I was beating them.” His eyes are wide. “It blew my mind. Just that one little taste made me realise that this technology is going to change the world.”There’s nothing new about BCIs. The first experiments involving chips and animal brains beganin the late 1960s. The gold standard in human BCI design, the Utah Array – a square matrix of needles inserted 1.5mm into the brain – was developed in 1992. Two decades before Noland’s surgery, in 2004, a quadriplegic man calledMatthew Naglebecame the first person to have a chip implanted inside his skull. While no regulator has yet allowed BCIs to be used outside an experimental setting, enough people have them for anonline forum, BCI Pioneers, to exist for the community.But Noland is the first to try out the chip produced by an entrepreneur whose explicit aim is to find a way to feed informationintothe brain, as well as receiving from it – a man who has proved to be all too willing to tip the scales of social media to beam his thoughts into millions of people’s phones with real-world consequences, promoting far-right figures inthe UKand Germany, and fuellingriots across Englandlast summer.The theory behind BCIs is relatively simple: they read the electrical signals produced by neurons and turn them into computer commands. (The brain cells of a quadriplegic person are still firing, after all, but the signals are prevented from travelling down the spinal cord.) BCIs can connect to the brain either through a wearable device, such as a cap, or by being surgically attached to brain tissue. The closer the device is to the brain cells, the more accurately it can translate the signals.View image in fullscreenThe world’s richest man, Elon Musk, who conceived of and funded the chips.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesNeuralink’s N1 chip is wireless and aimed to be smaller and more powerful than any that had gone before. (It’s about the size of a 50p coin.) While the Utah Array had 100 electrodes reading signals from targeted neurons,the brochureused to recruit Noland – which resembles an ad for an Apple product – boasts of “1,024 electrodes distributed across 64 threads, each thinner than a human hair”. Those 64 threads are inserted “reliably and efficiently” 3.5mm into the cortex of the brain by Neuralink’s R1 surgical robot.In his authorised biography of Musk, Walter Isaacson describes how the billionaire first began thinking about implanting chips in brains in 2016, when he was travelling in a car with his chief of staff, Sam Teller, and became frustrated by how long it took for him to type a message on his iPhone. “Imagine if you could think into the machine,” Musk said, “like a high-speed connection directly between your mind and your machine.” Musk immediately asked Teller to find him a neuroscientist who could help him understand BCIs.Many of Musk’s ventures have been influenced by his love of science fiction, from reusable rocket ships (SpaceX), electric cars andhumanoid robots(Tesla) tohyperloops for mass transit in autonomous pods(The Boring Company). Neuralink is inspired by the Culture series of novels by Iain M Banks, which Musk hassingled outfor praise. Banks describes a brain implant called a “neural lace” that is implanted in childhood, and can read and store every thought and sensation a person experiences. “When I first read Banks, it struck me that this idea had a chance of protecting us on the artificial intelligence front,” Musk told Isaacson.“Everything that you’ve ever experienced in your whole life – smell, emotions – all of those are electrical signals,” hetold podcaster Lex Fridmanin August. “If you trigger the right neuron, you could trigger a particular scent. You could certainly make things glow. You can think of the brain as a biological computer.” As such, the brain could be harnessed – or hacked.People can not like Elon Musk for a lot of different reasons, but what he’s doing – pushing the boundaries of space travel, the cars, the internet – it’s incredibleMusk hopes the enhanced human brain will be able to keep one step ahead of – or at least keep up with – computers. “If we can find good commercial uses to fund Neuralink, then in a few decades, we will get to our ultimate goal of protecting us against evil AI by tightly coupling the human world to our digital machinery,” he told Isaacson. His first commercial target was augmenting people with quadriplegia.Of the eight-strong team of neuroscientists and engineers who co-founded Neuralink in 2016, only one remains. Former employees havecomplained of being under pressureto produce results within rushed timelines. But those who stayed with the company were able to create the kind of eye-catching stunts Musk was looking for.In an eventlivestreamed on YouTubein August 2020, Musk unveiled Gertrude the pig, who had been living with a Neuralink chip nestled under her skull for two months. He showed how Gertrude’s movements were being read by the chip and wirelessly transmitted to a computer. “I could have a Neuralink right now and you wouldn’t know,” Musk said. “Maybe I do.” (In response to the demo, MIT Technology Review saidNeuralink was simply “neuroscience theater”.) Eight months later, Neuralink released avideo of a macaque named Pagerplaying the video game Pong using only the power of his mind. When he scored well, he was rewarded with a sip of banana smoothie.The company was swiftlydogged with allegations of animal cruelty, with aWired investigationdetailing vet records containing “gruesome portrayals of suffering endured by as many as a dozen of Neuralink’s primate subjects”. (The US Department of Agriculture ultimately reported that itcould not find any violations of animal research ruleswhen it inspected the facilities in 2023.)In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)gave Neuralink an investigational device exemptionthat allowed them to recruit participants for the first ever human trials. Neuralink’sPrime studyaimed to demonstrate that the NI implant was “safe and useful in daily life”. All they needed was the right human being.In the years after his accident, Noland did whatever he could to increase his chances of regaining some of what he had lost. He added his name to the largest database for spinal cord injury studies in North America, but was never chosen to take part. He thinks it was because he was honest about being a smoker on the questionnaire. He was told that if he tried to move as much as possible – wiggling his fingers, rotating his wrists – his brain might create new neural pathways. Night after night, he’d lie in bed with his eyes closed, focusing on trying to move. “You think: ‘Oh, I’m finally moving – I can feel myself moving!’ You open your eyes and look, and nothing is happening. It’s really frustrating.”Then, on 19 September 2023, a friend rang him. “He’s a big Elon Musk fan. He knew all about Neuralink. And when he saw that the human trials had opened up, the first thing he did was give me a call.”At that time, Noland says he only knew “what the average person knows” about Musk: “Tesla owner, SpaceX, Starlink, richest man in the world sort of thing. Darling of the left for years, spoke out about a couple of things, the left basically turned against him, and then he started making his way towards the right.” He knew nothing about Neuralink, but his view on Musk was clear: “He is one of the most impressive men that have lived in my lifetime. People can not like him for a lot of different reasons, but what he’s doing – pushing the boundaries of space travel, the cars, the internet – it’s incredible.”His friend helped him fill out the online application on the day the trial opened. His first interview was just three days later, on a Friday. The following Monday, he had his second interview.Determined to stand out, Noland chose the first available slot for every interview, but he didn’t hold out much hope of being chosen. “Other quadriplegics go out and do things with their lives; I came home after my accident and lived with my parents. I thought they’d probably want someone more impressive.”View image in fullscreen‘I called it telekinesis,’ says Noland, ‘but Elon Musk called it telepathy.’Photograph: Steve Craft/The GuardianIt’s obvious to me that he is the perfect candidate: a warm, likable, earnest person whose future was taken from him by a twist of fate at the start of his adult life. From a PR perspective, he’d clearly be a fantastic choice. But Noland really doesn’t see it.There were several rounds of interviews and assessments. Noland was sent to the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, for eight hours of scans, blood tests, urine tests, memory tests and psychological evaluations. The Neuralink team spoke to Mia, too. “They asked if we had any concerns, questions, doubts or anything,” she says. “Noly used to send me stuff to read. I didn’t want to know every detail. I just wanted to be as supportive as I could.”Noland agreed to be part of Neuralink’s Prime study for six years; he had to sign a 35-page consent form, which included what he describes as a “laundry list” of risks. In early January 2024, he got the call telling him he had officially been selected to be the first person to have a Neuralink chip. His surgery would be in two weeks.Even though it all happened so fast, Noland said he was ready for anything. “I’m good at lying there and thinking through every possible scenario. I told my parents: ‘If I have any sort of brain injury, then I don’t want to live with you any more – I want you to put me in a home.’ I did everything I needed to do. I was so at peace.”“I got a little bit worried and nervous, because he’s already been through so much,” Mia tells me, making a twisting motion with her fists over her stomach. “But you just look at Noland and you think: ‘He’s got this; he’s excited.’ That helped a lot.”Musk was supposed to be at the Barrow Neurological Institute on the morning of Noland’s surgery, on 29 January 2024. “I guess something happened with his plane – a malfunction or something – so he couldn’t make it,” Noland says. They FaceTimed just before he went into theatre. “It lasted maybe a minute. ‘Hey, I’m really excited. Thank you. This is such a cool thing, what you’re doing, it’s awesome.’ That’s whatIwas saying tohim,” he says, smiling. “He was like: ‘You’re gonna be making history,’ things like that.” Noland was unfazed to be speaking to the world’s richest man. “He’s a regular guy – just much more impressive and a little bit more eccentric.”You’re not thinking about doing it – you’re just willing the cursor to go wherever you want. When I first moved it with imagined movement, it blew my mindThe surgery took less than two hours. He shows me a picture on his phone of the large L-shaped incision on his shaved head. There’s nothing to see now: shaggy dark hair covers the scar. “They took out a piece of my skull and then replaced my skull with the chip. My skin is over the top,” he says, letting me feel the spongy place on his scalp where there is no longer any bone.Musk arrived with his entourage when Noland was still groggy from the anaesthetic. He thanked Noland, and told him the surgery had been a success. A little later, a 10-strong Neuralink team came in to wake up the implant. When they switched it on and could see it had connected with a tablet that was receiving real-time information from Noland’s brain cells, some of them burst into tears. “I was trying to move my finger, like I’d done a million times, and I saw a big yellow spike [on the screen].” The whole room erupted with applause.Next, Noland and the chip had to learn how to work together: the human learning how to create the best signals with his mind, the computer how to correctly decode them. Noland still does four hours a day of what he calls “session” work for Neuralink, performing exercises such as clicking targets on a screen to fine-tune the cursor control.But it quickly became second nature to him. At first, he used what he calls “attempted” movements: he would try to move his hand and the cursor would move where he was trying to get his hand to go. But then he became able to direct it with “imagined” movements: he was no longer trying to move anything apart from the cursor itself.“You’re not thinking about doing it – you’re justwillingthe cursor to go wherever you want.” His eyes are wide. “When I first moved it with imagined movement, it blew my mind. It was crazy. That was two weeks in, and I was giddy all day. That was when it all became real to me.”It sounds like telekinesis, I say. Noland shrugs. “I called it telekinesis – you’re moving something with your mind – but Elon Musk called it telepathy, because I’m communicating with a computer through my mind.”Musk’s goal is not to allow quadriplegics to move things, after all – it’s for minds to have seamless interfaces with computers.But it has been far from seamless for Noland. At first, he was frustrated that he had to stop using the implant every five or six hours so he could charge it. But the Neuralink team managed to find a fix, and now he can use the N1 continuously, wearing a baseball cap fitted with a coil that has been charged from the mains whenever the battery is low.Then, a month after his surgery, the worst happened: the implant began to stop working. He started to lose control of the cursor. It came to a head when he travelled to Fremont to visit Neuralink’s California facility and demonstrate his new skills. Noland assumed the team must have tinkered with the software. “I was like: ‘You guys need to fix this. I’m here to play Mario Kart with Neuralink. I can’t have you guys messing around with things right before I do that.’”Just before he arrived, the team informed him that when they’d performed the surgery they hadn’t factored in how much his brain moves, pulsing with each heartbeat. The threads had started retracting as soon as they had been implanted; now 85% of them were out of place, their electrodes picking up nothing at all.View image in fullscreenA robot used in the implant surgery.Photograph: Neuralink“It was really bad. I was getting it all taken away from me. That wasreally, really hard,” says Noland.“He cried,” says Mia. “We gave him time. He didn’t want us around him.”Noland nods. “I cried in my van right before we went over to Neuralink.”He asked the team to “do whatever they needed to do to fix it. Go in and do another surgery.” But the neurosurgeon was reluctant to operate on him again, he says. Instead, Neuralink engineers tweaked the software, so that the remaining 15% of the threads read groups of neuron signals, instead of signals from individual cells. So far, it works.Noland’s main frustration now is how he types – by moving his cursor to click individual letters on a keyboard. It’s nowhere near the kind of mind-to-screen text output that Musk dreamed of when he founded Neuralink. “We have gotten up to almost 25 words a minute, but dictation is still better. We’ll see how that goes over time.”He knows that his Neuralink chip will always be the worst. In August 2024, thecompany announcedthat a second trial participant – an anonymous quadriplegic man who has chosen not to meet or speak to Noland – had received an implant. With his superior chip, “Alex” is able to design three-dimensional objects using the power of his mind. None of his threads have retracted. Last month,Musk revealedthat a third – also unnamed – person had now received a Neuralink chip.Is Noland envious of those who will come after him? “A little bit,” he concedes. “I’m really excited for them though.”Although relentlessly positive, Noland recognises the dark possibilities of the technology lodged in his brain. Neuralink says it doesn’t monitor his brain or track what he does online, but warned him that someone might be able to “reverse engineer” the data produced by his neurons to work out what he’s been looking at. “With that in mind, I keep it very PG,” he tells me.On the day of the US presidential election,Noland tweeted a headlinefrom the satirical website the Onion: “Neuralink Patient Unable To Stop Hand From Voting For Trump.” “So true,” he joked. (He voted for Trump of his own free will.) Five days later, heasked his followerswhat the “biggest moral and ethical concerns” of a Neuralink implant could be.“Kids might use it to cheat in school,” one responded.“Hacking them and taking over a user,” said another.“The ability for others to read your mind … and interfere with it,” said a third.Why ask the question? “It’s something I get asked constantly, and I don’t have good answers.” But he’s clearly thought about it. When I ask him what a bad use of a BCI might be, he reels off a list. “Mind control, body control. At this point, it’s only reading my signals, but it will be able to write at some point, and sending signals into the brain can bescary. You could make people see anything, experience different feelings, emotions, hallucinations …”Musk is excited about a future where Neuralink sends signals to the brain. He explored the possibilities with Isaacson. “Want to see infrared, ultraviolet? How about radio waves or radar?”In a presentation in 2022, Musk described how the ability for Neuralink to write on the brain would allow someone born blind to see. He also said he was “confident that it is possible to restore full body functionality to somebody who has a severed spinal cord” using chips implanted below the site of injury.Noland dreams of being able to connect to a Tesla car and Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot. ‘It would mean I could have a 24-hour caregiver that I can control, and be able to get around’The billionaire’s extraordinary ambitions have so far been able to go almost unchecked. Neuralink hasn’t registered its human trials at the publicly accessible database ClinicalTrials.gov, and has made very few details about its research public. This avoidance of external scrutiny has led medical ethicists todescribe Neuralink as “science by press release”. Musk’s impatience for eye-catching results is likely to increase now that Neuralink has serious competition from other startups, both inthe USandin China, where companies arefocusing on non-therapeutic BCIsthat could enhance cognition among the general population.In August, Musk said thathundreds of millions of peoplewill have a Neuralink implant within the next two decades. “If it’s extremely safe, and you can have superhuman abilities – let’s say you can upload your memories, so you wouldn’t lose memories – then I think probably a lot of people would choose to have it,” he added. This is either the ultimate in wearable tech or Black Mirror dystopia, depending on your point of view. “I might get it …” Joe Rogan, the US podcaster, remarked last year. “I don’t want to be the only person who can’t read minds.”It might all be hype and bluster. But it’s possible to imagine a future where the sum total of all human knowledge is available to anyone with a brain implant. They could switch off their anxiety – or their empathy – as required. With total recall of every moment in their lives and every piece of information they ever encountered, every problem solved before the conscious mind could consider it, life for these people would be pretty much frictionless. In that world, wouldn’t there be incredible inequality between those who had BCIs and those who didn’t?“If you think about all technology today, there are people who have the money to use things and people who don’t,” Noland says when I put this to him. “I know Elon wants to produce it to scale, and make it cheap and affordable.” He shrugs. “It’s not fair, but life isn’t fair.”FDA rules mean Neuralink can’t pay Noland for his participation in the research, or contribute to the cost of his care. His house isn’t fully accessible; for the last eight years, he has been showering outside in his back yard. “There’s no privacy. But we didn’t have the money to build a shower for me. That’s something that we’ve always wanted.”Since becoming the human face of Neuralink, Noland has amassed more than 128,000 followers on X. In November, he announced that he was going to do a72-hour fundraising livestream: people could watch him using the brain implant in real time and donate so his family could build a new house that would meet his needs. He raised $750,000 over those three days, he tells me, but most of it came from the “crypto community” and will be subject to huge taxes when he tries to cash it out. He’s still trying to raise funds.Noland dreams of being able to connect to a Tesla car and Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot. “It would give me the ability to have a 24-hour caregiver that I can control, to doanythingfor me, and I would be able to get around.”View image in fullscreenNoland got to keep the cast of his head which was used for the implant surgery and later signed by Elon Musk and the Neuralink team.Photograph: Steve Craft/The GuardianYou could start smoking again, I say.“I couldtotallystart smoking again. I could teach the Optimus robot how to roll cigarettes!”“What the heck are you encouraging him to do? Jenny, you can leave now,” says Mia, laughing.The reality of Noland’s future looks far more prosaic. When the study ends, Neuralink will either remove his implant or simply switch it off. Surely he will want an upgrade then?“They can’t promise me anything,” he says. “Any sort of promises would incentivise me to stay in the study.” He’d like to go back to college to complete his degree, and then use his skills as a spokesperson to become an advocate for the growing BCI community. If anyone ever works out a way to restore movement to people with quadriplegia, Noland says it will probably be too late for him: his muscles have already atrophied so much.“I’m content with my lot in life,” he says. “I was before Neuralink, and I will be again after. I’ll find a way.”As I pack up my things, Noland tells me that he calls his chip Eve. He’s always liked that name. “Neuralink and I, we’re on the eve of something great, so that works out perfect, too. Also – Adam and Eve. God created Adam, and then gave Adam a helper, who is Eve. I’m Adam, in this scenario, and Eve is my helper. Together they cursed humanity. Maybe I will do the same, with Eve.”He shoots me a bright grin. “I don’t think enough people enjoy that joke as much as I do.”Explore more on these topicsNeuroscienceElon MuskDisabilityEthicsHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The case, filed in federal court in New York city, alleges theTrump administrationallowed Musk’s team access to the treasury department’s central payment system in violation of federal law.Trump hints Musk ‘Doge’ team has free rein with Pentagon next in line for cutsRead moreThe payment system handles tax refunds, social security benefits, veterans’ benefits and much more, sending out trillions of dollars every year while containing an expansive network of Americans’ personal and financial data.Engelmayer, who was appointed by Barack Obama, also said anyone prohibited from having access to the sensitive information since 20 January must immediately destroy all copies of material downloaded from treasury department systems.He set a hearing for 14 February.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit being filed.The New York attorney general, Letitia James, whose office filed the lawsuit, said Doge’s access to the treasury department’s data raised security problems and the possibility of an illegal freeze in federal funds.“This unelected group, led by the world’s richest man, is not authorized to have this information, and they explicitly sought this unauthorized access to illegally block payments that millions of Americans rely on, payments for health care, childcare and other essential programs,” James said in a video message released by her office on Friday.James, a Democrat who has been one of Trump’s chief antagonists, said the president does not have the power to give away Americans’ private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress.Musk’s Doge was created to discover and eliminate what the Trump administration has deemed to be wasteful government spending. Doge’s access to treasury records, as well as its inspection of various government agencies, has ignited widespread concern among criticsover the increasing power of Musk, while supporters have cheered at the idea of reining in bloated government finances.Musk has made fun of criticism of Doge on his X social media platform while claiming it is saving taxpayers millions of dollars.States also included in the lawsuit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.The suit alleges that Doge’s access to the treasury records could interfere with funding already appropriated by Congress, which would exceed the treasury department’s statutory authority. The case also argues that the Doge access violates federal administrative law and the US constitution’s separation of powers doctrine.It also accuses the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, of changing the department’s longstanding policy for protecting sensitive personally identifiable information and financial information to allow Musk’s Doge team access to its payment systems.“This decision failed to account for legal obligations to protect such data and ignored the privacy expectations of federal fund recipients,” including states, veterans, retirees and taxpayers, the lawsuit says.Connecticut’s attorney general, William Tong, said it was not clear what Doge was doing with the information in the treasury systems.“This is the largest data breach in American history,” Tong said in a statement on Friday. “Doge is an unlawfully constituted band of renegade tech bros combing through confidential records, sensitive data and critical payment systems. What could go wrong?”The treasury department has said the review was about assessing the integrity of the system and that no changes were being made. According to two people familiar with the process, Musk’s team began its inquiry looking for ways tosuspend payments made by USAid, the US Agency for International Development, which Trump and Musk are attempting to dismantle. The two people spoke with the Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.Separately, Democratic lawmakers are seeking a treasury department investigation of Doge’s access to the government’s payment system.Also, labor unions and advocacy groups have sued to block the payments system review over concerns about its legality. A judge in Washington on Thursday temporarily restricted access to two employees with “read only” privileges.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, for the past two decades Ma, one of the four co-founders ofGoogle Maps, has buried himself in a big black hole of anonymity. But not because of any shame or regret – it’s just that he isn’t one to blow his own trumpet.“I tend to be a very private person,” Ma says in a rare interview. “I find the limelight uncomfortable.”In the years since launching on 8 February 2005,GoogleMaps has wormed its way into our daily lives, becoming – like water or electricity – an essential service. It’s a pocket atlas, compass, restaurant guide, bus timetable and the go-to search and recommendation engine for all our geospatial queries.Google owner drops promise not to use AI for weaponsRead moreGoogle Maps has become an online juggernaut boasting more than 2 billion monthly users worldwide that remains on a trajectory of relentless expansion in scope and scale. It also powers countless third-party platforms including Airbnb, Uber, real estate portals and food delivery and e-commerce platforms that rely on Google Maps’ locational and navigational prowess.The technology is now a key pillar of the Google/Alphabet technology complex, a company the author and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari describes as one of our “unfathomable, algorithmic overlords”.Now, on the eve of Google Maps’ 20th anniversary, the 54-year-old Australian software engineer has had a change of heart. He wants to write himself back into the foundation story – as well as acknowledge others whose contributions have been overlooked or undersold.View image in fullscreen‘I’m actually surprised how similar [the prototype] looks to what Google Maps looks like today,’ Ma says.Photograph: Isabella Moore/The GuardianBeing recognised as a Google Maps founder still garners a lot of respect from the Stem community – particularly in Australia, where Google Maps was born. It might not make you a household name but it can open doors.Ma’s story begins in the New South Wales country town of Cooma, where his family ran a Chinese restaurant. For 20 years until the mid-1980s, the Dragon’s Gate was a fixture on Cooma’s main street, serving Cantonese-Australian favourites including chicken chow mein and sweet and sour pork.It provided a livelihood for the extended family and everyone pitched in. When he wasn’t attending school, Ma worked the till, taking payments, bookings and takeaway orders. In all other respects, however, he remembers it as a normal childhood – much of which was spent in front of screens.“I did a lot of the stereotypical tech nerd things like playing video games and learning how to program on an Apple II computer,” he recalls.By 1998, Ma had graduated from university and was working in Sydney when he landed a job in Silicon Valley, just as the dotcom boom was careering towards peak insanity. Then the bubble burst and, by the early 2000s, Ma, along with thousands of others in the tech sector, found themselves unemployed.After returning to Sydney he was contacted by a former colleague and fellow Australian called Noel Gordon who invited Ma to join him and two other unemployed software engineers – the Danish brothers Jens and Lars Rasmussen – to work on a startup. Their big idea was to build a new type of mapping platform.At that time, the undisputed market leader in online mapping was MapQuest, which had been acquired by the internet giant AOL in 1999 for the then staggering sum of $US1.1bn.But MapQuest was clunky and lived halfway between the digital and analogue worlds: a user plotting a route had to print the turn-by-turn directions from their desktop or laptop computer. It was a digital dinosaur, completely unaware of the approaching cataclysm.Calling themselves Where 2 Technologies, the four partners based themselves in the spare bedroom of Gordon’s apartment in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill and began building a Windows application program they dubbed Expedition.A screenshot of the 2004 prototype Ma shows me has a familiar look and feel. There’s an address bar at the top and in the centre, a map of downtown San Francisco with a route following Interstate 80 over the Bay Bridge highlighted as a red line. Two location pins, in the form of a US-style letterbox on a pole, mark specific locations.“I’m actually surprised how similar it looks to what Google Maps looks like today,” says Ma, inspecting the screenshot for the first time in many years.View image in fullscreenThe Where 2 team was acquired in 2004 by Google; months later, Google Maps made its debut.Photograph: Algi Febri Sugita/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockThis was the demo they presented to Sequoia Capital, the legendary Silicon Valley venture capital firm that has been bankrolling some of the biggest names in the startup world since the 1970s. The Where 2 crew was hoping to secure some seed funding and take the pressure off their dwindling personal savings and maxed-out credit cards.But in March 2004 Yahoo Maps launched a new feature called SmartView, enabling users to conduct map-based searches for restaurants and entertainment venues. Today it’s a standard feature on all online maps; back then, it was groundbreaking enough to spook Sequoia into pulling the plug on the deal.As a consolation prize, the Where 2 team was introduced to Google, one of Sequoia’s star clients. And not just anyone at Google: they got to present their demo to Larry Page, one of Google’s co-founders.Google parent Alphabet’s revenues disappoint Wall Street amid stiff AI competitionRead morePage was impressed but had no interest in desktop software. “Wereallylike the web,” he told the Rasmussen brothers – meaning Google was only interested if the map features worked in the web browser.The Where 2 team scrambled together a web version of their program using a little-known set of web development techniques known by the acronym Ajax, short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, a web language. It meant an already loaded webpage could fetch new data – in other words, update itself – without needing to refresh the entire page.Instead of loading a massive image of a map, the webpage would load multiple smaller map tiles and display them as required. It gave the sense of dynamic, frictionless motion you now experience on all online mapping platforms.The demo was a hit. Google hired the Where 2 team and subsequently bought their intellectual property for an undisclosed price.“Google was very good at picking up good teams at very low prices because there was no competition in the acquisition space at that time,” says Ma.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would be have been split between multiple owners.Since then, shares in Google’s holding company Alphabet have surged. Adjusting for stock splits, a share was worth about US$2 when the company floated in 2004. This week, shares are trading in the US$190 to US$200 range.On 7 June 2004 the Where 2 crew turned up for work as Google employees at the company’s Sydney office, which at that time only comprised six salespeople. Eight months later, Google Maps made its debut.“It’s a great product and they did what they did very successfully,” says Prof Scott McQuire, a professor of media and communications at the University of Melbourne. “[But] Google Maps works on the basis of data extraction. It’s getting location information, so that’s very valuable data for all kinds of people who want to gather information about you.”Ma says commercialisation and data mining were not on the radar when he was working on the maps. These emerged after he moved on to other projects in 2006. “I don’t think we were thinking about it too much about it at the time,” he says.“The prevailing belief was that once you get the users on board, you could then figure out a strategy.”He acknowledges the privacy concerns: the task of keeping companies honest and transparent is partly in the hands of the user and partly the responsibility of governments, he says. “The biggest issue is the fact that the technology landscape changes so quickly. It’s very hard for these regulatory mechanisms to keep up.”It’s not just privacy that is raising red flags. There’s also an emerging anxiety about the effect over-reliance on satellite navigation – and by inference, Google Maps – is having on brain function.View image in fullscreen‘Knowing that so many people are using something that I helped build, that’s probably the most satisfying part of it.’Photograph: Isabella Moore/The GuardianScientific studies show that extended reliance on these drivers’ aides may be associated with a reduction in the hippocampus, the part of the brain dealing with spatial memory. This could be a factor in cognitive decline.Ma acknowledges that there are potential dangers in the uptake of many new technologies but believes we should be aware more than concerned. “I think as humans, we are very adaptable. But are we adapting it in a way that is overcoming the potential detriment? I don’t know.”Ma is not the type of garrulous, big-vision character usually associated with the startup scene. He’s a bit unkempt, a bit traditional and not one for chit-chat. But he is proud of the role he played in getting Google Maps off the ground.“There are ways to feel rewarded,” he says. “It could be monetary, it could be recognition. But knowing that so many people are using something that I helped build, that’s probably the most satisfying part of it.”In terms of who gets the credit, Ma says while there were originally four people behind Where 2, most of the kudos should go to Jens and Lars Rasmussen: it was their idea in the first place.But there are others whose contributions have been overlooked. In particular, he cites Bret Taylor, James Norris, Andrew Kirmse and Seth LaForge, whose names were included on the original Google Maps patent. If there are any arguments about Google Maps’ origin story, Ma says this list should settle the dispute.“I think it’s important because quite often the perception is that one or two people are responsible for the majority of the work, whereas almost always it’s going to be a team.”Noel Gordon, Ma’s Google Maps co-founder, describes Ma as a “rockstar software engineer” who can write beautiful code with “no fat on it”.“Stephen is one of those people who gets straight to the point that needs to be solved, really quickly. He’s just one of a kind.”These days, Ma is working with a partner in a venture called Reggie Health. It uses AI to automate administrative tasks for healthcare providers and anyone else who needs to juggle appointments, manage patients and send reminders.Since leaving Google 14 years ago, Ma has only ever worked in startups: up to this point, none has been successful. But that doesn’t deter him. He’s someone who gets a thrill from tackling problems and finding solutions.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorGoogle MapsGoogleAlphabetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But some of Musk’s longstanding positions lead a straight line to his far-right sympathiesChris McGrealSat 8 Feb 2025 08.24 ESTFirst published on Sat 8 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTShareView image in fullscreenMusk’s embrace of the far right has raised urgent questions about what Musk’s political beliefs and how he intends to use his newfound power.Composite: Angelica Alzona/Guardian Design; Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty ImagesElon Muskis not a people person, as millions around the world will be able to attest after the planet’s richest man cut off food supplies, healthcare and probably evenlife itselfto some of the most vulnerable without so much as a fore- or afterthought.Musk sees himself as a data man, wielding numbers like a machete to slash and burn his way through government waste and corruption as he leads the rightwing charge to capture the US state.Within days of Musk dispatching his minions to kick down the doors of the US Agency for International Development (USAid) and rifle through its finances, the agency was in effect out of business. Musk claimed USAid was “a criminal organisation” and full of Marxists – an assertion called “laughable” by the agency’s former administrator under George W Bush, Andrew Natsios, who describes himself as a conservative Republican.Musk didn’t care. Less than three weeks afterDonald Trump’s inauguration, the head of the new “department of government efficiency” (Doge), a special group that Trump created, has built an extensive power base in Washington of a kind not seen before.Trump has given free rein to Musk to send his operatives into more than a dozen federal agencies to look for evidence of mismanagement and subversion, and to generally create chaos, outside of the usual bounds of oversight and regulation.Crucially, Musk now in effect controls the office of personnel management (OPM), which oversees federal employment. He immediately encouraged more than 2 million government workers to resign with the stated aim of forcing a few hundred thousand out the door.View image in fullscreenA supporter of Donald Trump interrupts an anti-Doge protest outside the Department of Labor in Washington on Wednesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIt’s clear who Musk thinks should be running the country instead, from his recruitment to Doge of “special government employees” from his own companies and the wider tech industry to storm the federal citadels. They include a significant proportion of young male software engineers of the kind who tend to worship tech billionaires like Musk, including a teenager who has gone by “Big Balls” online.Few, if any, have undergone the security clearances other government workers need to access sensitive and personal information. If they had, Doge might have been discouraged from hiring another recruit from Silicon Valley, Marko Elez, who was sent into the US treasury department, where he had access to taxpayer records. Elez resigned on Thursday after the Wall Street Journalrevealedhe had posted racist messages on social media and defended eugenics.“Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” Elez wrote onXin July.Hewas reinstatedon Friday.On the face of it, Musk is implementing Trump’s commitment to cut spending, “dismantle the deep state” and sack “rogue bureaucrats”. But his embrace of the far right, including an unrestrained endorsement of the German nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD), and what looked to much of the world like aNazi saluteat Trump’s inauguration celebrations, has raised urgent questions about Musk’s political beliefs and how he intends to use his newfound power.As it happens, much of what Musk is doing is also good for his businesses, including scrapping regulatory bodies and curtailing the power of unions and workers. The labor board, which upholds workers’ rights, has been frozen and agencies that regulated the financial industry have either been scrapped or told to abandon key parts of their work.Musk’s politics have been eclectic. In the past, he has backed universal basic income and a tax on carbon emissions. At the same time, he has a deep dislike of trade unions and public transport because it means being around “random strangers, one of whom might be a serial killer”. He espouses a visceral hostility to diversity programmes and appears to regard those who believe in helping the less fortunate as subversive.Thrown into this mix is Musk’s fascination with thepro-natalism movement, for which he has done his bit by fathering 12 children, and his hope that one day his rocket company, SpaceX, will help them colonise Mars.Raised in South Africaunder apartheid, Musk is clearly suspicious of democracy and the leaders it produces. His grandfather headed a fringe political movement in Canada in the 1930s, Technocracy Incorporated, which sought to abolish democracy in favour of government by elite technicians, but its overtones of fascism saw it banned during the second world war.Musk shows some of the same tendencies, as do other libertarian-leaningSilicon Valleybillionaires unhappy with the messiness of elected government. He has spoken in support of direct democracy, where policies and other issues are decided by popular referendums rather than elected representatives.In the meantime, Musk appears happy to embrace the US version of the “strongman” ruler through the Republican right’s “unitary executive theory”, which regards the authority of the president as paramount and Congress as an impediment to the implementation of his or her will.Over the years, Musk has described himself as “not a conservative” and “politically moderate”. He backed the Democratic candidate in every presidential election going back to Barack Obama’s victory in 2008 until he soured on the party in the past few years.View image in fullscreenBarack Obama and Elon Musk in 2010.Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters“In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party. But they have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican. Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold,” hewrote on Xin 2022.But there were clues to other motives, including a statement that he would be voting Republican because of Joe Biden’s support for trade unions and what he regarded as insufficient Democratic backing for his companies.Not long before last year’s presidential election, Musk declared that Trump would save American democracy from Democrats trampling on individual liberties. But he kept moving ever further to the right in public, with an open embrace of racist European political leaders, including the AfD, and the promotion of claims of a “white genocide” in the country of his birth, South Africa.Musk’s biographer, Walter Isaacson,has linkedhis shift from Obama voter to cheerleader for the AfD to the transition of his daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson.Wilson was 16 when she texted a relative: “Hey, I’m transgender, and my name is now Jenna. Don’t tell my dad.” The day after Wilson turned 18 in 2022, she changed her name because of “gender identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form”.Musk told Isaacson he was sanguine about the change but then Wilson became a fervent Marxist and wouldn’t speak to him any more, a situation he described as one of the most painful of his life.“She went beyond socialism to being a full communist and thinking that anyone rich is evil,” Musk told the author.Musk blamed Wilson’s progressive Los Angeles school and said he was disturbed at the “woke mind virus” holding back America.After Californiapassed a lawbarring school districts from requiring teachers to tell parents of changes to a student’s sexual orientation and gender identity, Musk announced he was moving the headquarters of his two largest companies, SpaceX and X, to Texas. He said that the law caused “massive destruction of parental rights” and put children at risk of “permanent damage”.Musk did not say that moving his companies also had significant tax advantages for himself and his businesses, which would additionally be subject to fewer climate regulations than in California.Still, his apparent anger over his daughter’s transition appears to have set in motion a broader hostility toward identity issues, and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes, a favourite target of the Trumpian right. Musk announced that the words “cis” and “cisgender” were considered slurs on X, and he came out against pronouns, tweeting that they “suck”.In late 2022, another tweet linked Musk’s hostility toward the way people choose to identify themselves – an odd position for a man who claims to be a champion of free speech – to his anger at the Biden administration’s Covid restrictions.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Elon Musk in November 2024.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersMusk mocked Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, who was instrumental in the lockdown and other measures to contain the crisis.“My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,”he wrote.Some saw the tweet as evidence that Musk was nowopenly identifying with the far right, which defied mask regulations and stay-at-home orders and called for Fauci to be locked up for intruding on their liberties.But while Musk’s hostility toward pronouns was personal, Covid regulations touched on his businesses and net worth.Muskrefused to closehis Tesla factory at the height of the pandemic, claiming without evidence that “panic” over the virus would do more damage than the disease itself. He disparaged social distancing, predicted that the virus would claim few lives in the US (it eventually claimed more than 1.2 million), and described the lockdown as “fascist” and “erasing people’s freedoms”. Musk tweeted a meme comparing Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to Hitler over his government’s Covid restrictions.Musk may have dressed up his position as a concern about people’s welfare but its immediate effect was to keep his factories rolling even if the people working in them were at greater risk of infection and death. And while Musk claimed a principled position in favour of individual liberty, he has a history of suppressing the rights of his own workers.In 2023, he said that he disagreed with the concept of trade unions.“I just don’t like anything whichcreates a lords-and-peasantssort of thing,” he told the New York Times Dealbook Summit. “Unions naturally try to create negativity in a company.”One reason Musk may not like unions is they tend to stand up for their members. He has faced accusations from former employees of aggressively using a secretive dispute-resolution process to fend off repeated claims ofsexual and racial harassmentwithin his companies, including accusations of women enduring a “frat house” atmosphere of groping and other abuses ignored and even perpetrated by high-level managers.Tesla haspaid outmillions of dollars to Black workers subjected toracial harassment.Yet, while Musk restricts the rights of his employees to seek redress from the courts, he and his companies filed at least 23 lawsuits in federal courts in the year to August 2024,according to Fortune magazine.They include a legal action by X against the Center for Countering Digital Hate overa reportaccusing the social network of making millions of dollars out of accounts spewing hate from “neo-Nazis, white supremacists, misogynists and spreaders of dangerous conspiracy theories”. A California judge threw out the lawsuit last year,sayingit was clear the “case is about punishing the defendants for their speech”.Musk will probably spend a lot more time being frustrated by the courts. Judges have already put on hold his push for mass resignations from the civil service and placed some restrictions on Doge’s mass collection of data. Federal workers, unions and civil rights organisations are lining up a flurry of lawsuits to challenge Musk’s actions.But the courts themselves may become a target for Musk as he works to tear down the old order.Isaacson in his biography wrote that Musk once described being in “a state of war at all times” as one of his default settings.No one thinks that, so long as Trump continues to regard the billionaire as more of an asset than a liability, Musk’s thirst for power will stop at gutting federal agencies. The question is where he will launch his next offensive."

Who would have thought that sentence would ever be written? And yet, less than three weeks into Donald Trump’s second term, it is barely controversial to many people looking on from shell-shocked democracies beyond America’s shores. By his destructive, vindictive, illegal and irrational actions, Trump sets himself beyond the pale. In place of American exceptionalism, theworld must now learnto manage, and if necessary confront, a gross American objectionablism.Proof of these assertions is to be found in the White House’s daily outpourings. Seeking revenge against those who tried to punish his attempted 6 January 2021 electoral coup, Trump is weaponising the justice department by executive order. Political opponents, FBI agents, prosecutors,media outlets and journalistsare in his sights. In contrast, about 1,500 convicted Capitol Hill rioters have been pardoned. He has even had the gall towithdraw the security clearanceof his predecessor, Joe Biden, citing mental incapacity.Trump is treating federal government agencies like enemy territory to be stormed and purged of deep state, so-called woke and liberal elements. To this end, he has recruited the sycophantic billionaire, Elon Musk,and teams of youthful, unaccountable acolytesto physically take over offices and computer systems, suspend, lock out or sack civil servants and seize control of programmes and budgets. The treasury, the education department, the federal election commission and independent government watchdogs are all under the hammer wielded, principally, by Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”. Nor has the CIA and the wider “intelligence community” escaped Trump’s vendetta. It, too, faces mass firings under theproposed leadershipof Tulsi Gabbard, a Russia apologist. Putting theanti-vax conspiracy theorist, Robert F Kennedy Jr, in charge of health and human services demonstrates how little Trump really cares about ordinary people’s welfare.Diversity, equity and inclusion polices, in particular transgender rights, are under siegeTrump’s arbitrary,often unlawful ordersindulge other far-right obsessions. Diversity, equity and inclusion polices, in particular transgender rights, are under siege. He has demanded a halt to the rollout of EV charging stations, declared open season on wildlife and the environment by relaxing oil and gas drilling regulations, and withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement. He even wants to ban paper straws, preferring plastic. From an immediate international perspective, Trump’s decision to eviscerate USAid, the world’s biggest foreign aid provider, and the attempted sacking of nearly all its staff, is the most savagely objectionable misdeed of all.His freezing of USAid’s $42.8bn (£34.5bn) budget spells death or renewed suffering for millions of dependent people, from Sudan to Bangladesh to Ukraine. The US accounts for about $4 in every $10 spent globally on humanitarian aid. To the instant human toll, as Britain’s former prime ministerGordon Brown points out, must be added a loss of US global influence that will benefit authoritarian rivals China and Russia. “The era when American leaders valued their soft power is coming to an end,” Brown wrote. His view wasechoed by foreign secretary David Lammy, who described Trump’s mindless aid vandalism as a “big strategic mistake”.Trump’s egotistic rampage is causing widespread additional international damage and confusion. His on-off tariff wars with China, Canada and, prospectively, the EU; his militarisation of migration policy along the US border with Mexico; his imperialistic vow to seize Greenland by force from Nato ally Denmark; and his disdain for the UN, typified byhis withdrawal from the World Health Organizationand the UN Human Rights Council, are all decisions underscoring his broader contempt for the multilateralist, rules-based international order. Nothing more damningly illustrates that contempt than yet another outrageous executive ordersanctioning the international criminal court(ICC).Trump’s ICC attack was prompted in part by a wish to protect Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister and court-indicted war crimes suspect, who was feted at the White House last week. He used this occasion to unveil hismost absurd, most dangerous ideato date: a forcible “clean-out” of the 2 million inhabitants of Gaza and a US-owned “Riviera” real estate development amid the ruins of their Palestinian homeland. This wheeze is too ignorant, too insulting and too inhumane to be taken entirely seriously. Yet that has not stopped Israeli and US rightwingers using it as potential justification for wrecking the ceasefire, resuming the war and laying the ground for annexations in Gaza and the West Bank.Trump, the convicted felon, proves each day that he is unfit for the high office he holds. He aims to destroy the fundamentals of American democracy: the separation of powers, civil and voting rights, secularism, free speech and equality under the law. He is a menace to global peace, stability and prosperity.Pushback has begun, largely through the courts. Yet afew defiant judgescannot win this huge, rapidly developing struggle. The Democrats, stunned into virtual silence, must wake up. Meanwhile, Britain and the western democracies must take a united stand. So far, Keir Starmer and his ministers have been too circumspect. They must be bolder and braver in their criticism and in upholding British values.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Every day we hit them with three things. They’ll bite on one, and we’ll get all of our stuff done. Bang, bang, bang.”Since his re-election,Donald Trumphas been following this script to the letter, and the media, not to mention the entire world, are feeling punch-drunk. Which is, as Bannon pointed out, enabling other members of the Trump crew to get their stuff done. Really bad stuff too, to which the world has not been paying enough attention.Prime suspect in this respect is Elon Musk, whom Trump has chosen to slash $2tn off US government spending. Late on Friday 31 January, he and a few of his goons gained access to the Department of Treasury payments system – the system that processes the federal spending that makes up more than a fifth of the US economy. More importantly, Musk and a 25-year-old engineer named Marko Elez, who has previously worked for two of his companies,were given the abilityto make changes to the payments system, thereby enabling them to stop disbursements of taxpayers’ dollars to recipients that the Trump crowd decide are illegitimate – for examplea $367m paymentto an outfit called Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service Inc.He has signalled an intention to do to the federal bureaucracy what he did to Twitter in 2022: hollow it out and subject it to intensive personal controlIt’s conceivable, of course, that this payment was an example of the wasteful federal spending that Musk and co are pledged to root out and eliminate. But that is not the point. The point is that all the spending passing through the system constitutes expenditure that has been authorised by Congress. Traditionally, the system was run by apolitical civil servants who had no authority to decide whether a particular payment was unwise or unacceptable. Now, suddenly, that power has been appropriated by an unelected billionaire who spent a quarter of a billion dollars to ensure that Trump was elected.But the Treasury coup is just one part of a bigger story. Musk is not just going after payments, he’s also going after jobs, salaries and the employment status of federal employees. And his strategy mirrors what he did to Twitter after being forced to buy it. At around 5pm on 28 January, millions of US government employees received anemail from Musk with the subject line “Fork in the Road”. The message in the email was stark: accept a sweeping set of workplace changes or resign within nine days. It was more or less a replica of theemail that Twitter employees received in November 2022and it signals an intention to do to the federal bureaucracy what he did to Twitter in 2022: hollow it out and subject it to intensive personal control.It’s worth pondering the immensity of what’s happening while Trump blathers on about tariffs, acquiring Gaza, buying Greenland, trolling Justin Trudeau and generally “flooding the zone” with crap. As Mike Masnick, a distinguishedtech commentator, puts it: “A private citizen with zero constitutional authority is effectively seizing control of critical government functions. The constitution explicitly requires Senate confirmation for anyone wielding significant federal power – a requirement Musk has simply ignored as he installs his loyalists throughout the government while demanding access to basically all of the levers of power, and pushing out anyone who stands in his way.”Musk’s arrival at the heart of American power signals a new, sinister kind of technocracy – an obnoxious blend of obscene wealth, narcissism, arrogance, determination, IQ and the kind of “solutionism” that believes there is no problem that cannot be solved by technology. He reminds Masnick of “a toddler ‘fixing’ a grandfather clock by removing its pendulum. Yes, the clock needed maintenance – but now it can’t tell time at all. The federal government absolutely needs reform, but what we’re seeing isn’t reform – it’s vandalism dressed up as innovation.”The strange thing is that what most people expected from Trump 2.0 was his usual performative chaos: perhaps a bit less than last time, but chaos nonetheless. What no one saw coming was a tech bro who spotted an opportunity to use AI to re-engineer the US government in the name of the “efficiency” that Silicon Valley worships, and was able to pay hundreds of millions to get into the driving seat. In the bad old days, insurgent colonels would surround the presidential palace with tanks and capture the radio station. Thanks to Trump, Musk didn’t have to worry about the palace, and he already had his own radio station (X), so he went straight to the heart of the matter – the Treasury.

The press should handle him like parents with an ornery childSat 8 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 12.47 ESTShareTwo weeks into the Trump administration, I’m still being asked by foreigners about the new president’s “political vision”.Some of them, especially the French and the British, might be excused for excessive politeness toward a country that in many respects they still envy and admire. But on most of the news programs and podcasts to which I’ve been invited, I’m still encountering earnest interviewers struggling to understand Trump from a conventional political perspective, no matter how contradictory, irrational, or stupid his statements and actions may be. How can this be and what does it augur?The investigative psychiatrist Robert J Lifton once explained to me that Trump is a solipsist, as distinct from the narcissist that he’s often accused of being.A narcissist, while deeply self-infatuated, nevertheless seeks the approval of others and will occasionally attempt seduction to get what he wants (I think of the French president, Emmanuel Macron). For Trump the solipsist, the only point of reference is himself, so he makes no attempt even at faking interest in other people, since he can’t really see them from his self-centered position.Trump’s absence of external connection is self-evident: his treatment of the “other” – from his own family to his tenants,his political rivals, the victims of the Los Angeles fires or the displaced people of Gaza – displays not only a lack of empathy, but also an emotional blindness. How else could he tease out loud aboutdating his own daughter, Ivanka? How else could he socruelly insultformer president Biden in his inauguration address, with Biden seated just a short distance away?Trump’s solipsistic character was on full display on 20 January in the Capitol Rotunda. After stating, absurdly, that houses had burned “tragically” in Los Angeles “without even a token of defense”, the president seemed to turn philosophical and then appeared to ad-lib: “Some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country … they don’t have a home any longer. That’s interesting.”What could be better for a solipsist than to be criticized across the full spectrum of America’s limited ideological bandwidth?I suppose it’s better than his reaction to a 2018 fire in Trump Tower that killed a resident, Todd Brassner. Trump’s tweeted response: “Fire at Trump Tower is out. Very confined (well built building). Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU!” No condolences for the dead man or his family. That’s also interesting.None of this is to say that Trump’s policy directives don’t suggest disturbing political predilections that need to be discussed and challenged. He is the president, after all, not just a coldhearted landlord. His firing of 17 inspectors general, attempt to end birthright citizenship and temporary halt of “all federal financial assistance” are certainly causes for concern, and possibly alarm. So, also, are his threats to slap high tariffs on Canada and Mexico, friendly nations that normally are happy to kowtow to their vastly more powerful neighbor no matter who occupies the White House.But this misses the point of Trump, malevolent though he may be. He delights in being attacked because it keeps him at center stage. What could be better for a solipsist than to be criticized across the full spectrum of America’s limited ideological bandwidth?In an editorial, the New York Times denounced Trump’s “first assertions of executive power” that “blatantly exceed what is legally granted”. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal ridiculed an unprovoked “trade war” that “will qualify as one of the dumbest in history”. Already, Trump has changed the script by “pausing” the tariff increases, but he got the Journal worked up enough to pay him a lot of attention. Federal judges blocked Trump’s two most obviously unconstitutional orders, but the Times still got into a dither about his threats to the constitution.View image in fullscreen‘Humor, sarcasm and ridicule can be useful tools, though as we learned from Barack Obama’s famous roast of Trump in 2011, they can also motivate the target to run for president.’Photograph: Will Oliver/EPAOne can’t just ignore Trump’s blathering, but like parents dealing with an ornery child, editors, reporters and columnists need to temper reprimands and raised voices with self-restraint, calmness and even studied indifference. Humor, sarcasm and ridicule can be useful tools, though as we learned from Barack Obama’s famous roast of Trump in 2011, they can also motivate the target to run for president.Covering Trump, like bringing up children, is an art, not a science.Of course, none of Trump’s tariff actions or anti-immigrant edicts will bring factories back from Mexico (the cheap labor and investment protections under our current trade agreement with Mexico and Canada are too good for a rational businessman to pass up). Neither will they quickly raise wages for working-class citizens, since creating a labor shortage through deportations will take much longer to affect pay scales than if Congress simply raised the federal minimum wage, or legalized the “illegals”. Also, ironically, Trump’s tariff threats and military border bluster may backfire and encourage fentanyl production to move to the United States from south of the border.However, it’s a fair bet that Trump the solipsist doesn’t care if his policies fail to help the ordinary people who voted for him, and we anti-Trumpers should fear his supporters’ rage if they conclude that they’ve been duped by their hero. The backlash is more likely to be felt by liberals than by Trump, who will retreat safely to Mar-a-Lago and resumecheating at golf.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s always collateral damage when somebody starts a war.On the eve of the inauguration, in the Watergate Hotel, I attended the “Coronation Ball”, where “populist” and royalist rightwingers packed the Moretti Grand Ballroom to drink and dine on French champagne and red wine, as well as Gallic cuisine that included amuse-bouches. I was there at the invitation of an open-minded business consultant, an unfanatical Trump partisan who may not have understood that I wanted to cover the event, though he knows the world of journalism.‘He’s become America’s assignment editor’: US media owners bend to TrumpRead moreIt was indeed amusing to meet a guy wearing a Gen Douglas MacArthur button. So was hearing Steve Bannon’s rip-roaring speech, which flattered the black-tie and evening dress crowd as the “vanguard of a revolutionary movement” that was “just in the top of the first inning”. Bannon warned his rightwing Jacobins not to “flinch” or “question” Trump’s mission of ending “any of these forever wars” and accomplishing “the deportation of all 15 million illegal aliens”.And when Bannon called for “no mercy, no quarter, no prisoners”, he apparently was including Rupert Murdoch and Fox News: “Murdoch sent a memo: ‘We’re going to make [Trump] a non-person’ … and [Trump] knew it. And he still came back like Cincinnatus from the plough, who saved his country.” (Bannon might have mentioned that the Roman patrician, according to legend, was twice dictator of the Republic, but I quibble.)It wasn’t all amuse-bouches, however. Later in the evening, when the jazz band took a break, the far-right personality Jack Posobiec launched a diatribe against the cliques surrounding the former presidents Clinton, Obama and Biden, who, he said, would never return to power “because they’ll have to come through us”. Meanwhile, a lot of political prisoners would be freed, and not just the martyrs of January 6. “Derek Chauvin will be freed!” he declaimed.Two guests in military dress uniforms standing nearby looked at me, laughing with incredulous astonishment. “You’re going to tell us who he is ?” one said. Once I found out from other journalists in the crowd that it was Posobiec – he of “stop the steal” fame and other conspiracy theories dear to Trump and Maga – I could better appreciate the foreign journalists’ difficulty understanding the president. With no political vision, no long-range goals, it’s quite possible that it never occurred to Trump to pardon George Floyd’s murderer. But now that an influential courtier has serviced the monarch with a concrete idea – an idea guaranteed to slake a solipsist’s thirst for attention – we should all be worried about the short-term whims of the king.John R MacArthur is president and publisher of Harper’s MagazineExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS press and publishingUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

I diligently cut it backMore summer essentialsSat 8 Feb 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 19.38 ESTShareIn the late 1970s when my parents built the house I still live in, there was no forest. The property was a disused cow pasture, full of scrappy grass and weeds. My parents began planting trees before they began the house build, and now – in my lifespan, 47 years – it has grown into a forest. When I was a child we called my parent’s plantings “the garden”, implying a place managed by us. Cultivated, civilised. Somewhere along the way we renamed it “the forest”. A self-managed ecosystem we occasionally impinged upon – cutting back, cleaning up debris – but only when it made incursions into our actual house.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsIn the original house design, the garden was supposed to be the main feature. The rooms were all separate wooden modules built along an open central walkway, the garden growing between them. Almost half a century later, the house has been submerged in forest. We live in the undergrowth, far below the canopy. Staghorns and elkhorns and mosses and lichen grow on the tree trunks, the bromeliads endlessly reproduce. The tallest trees in our forest are more than 45 metres. They look ancient though they are not yet 50. My parents planted the forest but it feels timeless, eternal. They had a vision when they began but I don’t think they could have imagined just how big or beautiful or interconnected each tree they lovingly patted soil around could grow.An orchard: a place where you tame trees, or try to – an act of hope | Helen SullivanRead moreMaintaining a wooden house submerged in subtropical rainforest can sometimes feel like a full-time job. We once discovered a leaking pipe beneath our kitchen sink had moistened all the particle board shelving. When you opened the cupboard below the sink, it appeared normal but it had become suspiciously spongy to the touch. All the shelving would need replacing.We looked on – agog – as our handyman removed wheelbarrow loads of roots and composted soil from beneath our sink. Our kitchen cupboard was alive! The roots of the trees outside had grown between the slab and the wall, taking over the dampened particle board. Our forest had breached the boundaries of the house. Since then, we’ve been watchful. We dug trenches around the slabs so we could see if the roots were encroaching. The other day, lying in bed, I spied a thick tendril of philodendron spiralling inside an open wardrobe. How long had it been there? When did it break through?View image in fullscreenThe house was once ‘a disused cow pasture, full of scrappy grass and weeds’, Jessie Cole writesWhat is gardening if not a constant battle for control? Nature, rearranged. It is not uncommon for visitors to remark, “If this was my place, I would get rid of some of these trees.” The subtext being,this has gotten out of hand.For the most part, they are right. We have surrendered to the forest. Years back, we raised the white flag.Nowadays, we diligently preserve the house itself but there is no dominion over the trees. When I was little, the trees were little too, saplings – and we all grew together, from nothing much to something. We are close, we are kin. The trees are not ornamental, they are beings, our lives entwined. We try to live in harmony. Nonetheless, it takes a day to clean the gutters, and, of course, the leaf drop is unremitting, so it is also a surrender to the work of keeping the house safe and clean. Sometimes, a branch grows so low and bushy that it blocks access to my room. I diligently cut it back. Give a little, take a little.

Yes, we’ve had them. We’ve learned our house is sturdy enough to stand solidly beneath their weight, though one once lopped off our brick chimney on its way down. The crash it made was frightening – but the world is full of frightening things.There are parts of our property that have become truly wild. In my childhood, across a bubbling stream, we had a pristine Japanese garden, with a pond and a small pergola. There were giant boulders, artfully arranged, and manicured pathways. The forest has taken back this section. We could not preserve it. It was engulfed. In its heyday it was perhaps a folly, though we recall it fondly: the pond of flashing goldfish, the speckled trunks of the crepe myrtles. A vision once made manifest, if only for a decade or so. It lives on in our memory. You cannot, it turns out, hold everything.I never envisaged I would spend a lifetime embedded in a forest my parents planted, but sometimes you have to stick around to see things come to fruition. Some trees live hundreds of years. The magnitude of those lifespans is hard for the human mind to comprehend. How can we know, when we plant those seeds, just how extraordinary the trees might become?You can grow a forest in a lifetime. It can be grander and more sustaining than you could ever imagine. Visitors may gasp when they come to your home. Things may get out of hand. It is not too late to start something from scratch. It is not too late to dream. Plant a tree. Nourish it. We can’t know what the future may bring, but the trees know how to be a forest and – when we’re gone – they will prevail.Jessie Coleis the author of four books including the memoirs Staying and Desire, A ReckoningExplore more on these topicsTrees and forestsOpinionHousingRural AustraliacommentShareReuse this content"

There is something not right about surrogacy. The furore started with anInstagram post by Lily Collins: a picture of her new daughter, Tove, in a little basket, under which theEmily in Parisactor expressed “endless gratitude for our incredible surrogate”. Reaction split along predictable lines – those in favour of surrogacy, and those against.What was striking was that it also split along another fissure: Collins’s possible motives. It was OK, some felt, to use a surrogate if you have infertility problems. But not in order to keep your figure, help your career, or because pregnancy is taxing and you are rich enough to outsource it.People were also divided on the motives of the surrogate. All well and good if she was driven by a desire to help Collins and her husband. But not if the true reason was the need for money.Collins’s husband, Charlie McDowell,hit back at “unkind messages”, writing: “It’s OK to not know why someone might need a surrogate to have a child. It’s OK to not know the motivations of a surrogate regardless of what you assume.”But he would be wrong to think motives are irrelevant here. This row touches on a central problem with surrogacy. As with assisted dying, motives do matter. If surrogates are being coerced by financial need or by other people, that is a problem. If the rich are delegating pregnancy to others merely because they can, that is another.The trouble is – as with assisted dying – there are few ways to guarantee that someone is doing something for the right reasons. You cannot peer into people’s souls, divine their true reasons and legislate accordingly.There is a defensible version of surrogacy, involving commissioning parents who are genuinely in need and a “gestational carrier” who was not pressured by her circumstances. But there are many, many indefensible versions, and no sure way to guard against all of them. If some reasons for surrogacy are morally unacceptable, then so is the practice itself.Advocates tend to focus only on infertile couples yearning for a child. But there is no getting away from the fact that outsourcing childbirth is the preserve of the rich. It is increasingly common in Hollywood, for example:Sarah Jessica Parker,Nicole Kidman, Paris Hilton,Grimes, Khloé and Kim Kardashian, Priyanka Chopra, Rebel Wilson, Lucy Liu and Naomi Campbell have all reportedlyused a surrogateto have children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIf infertility is a good enough reason to use a surrogate, then why not preserving your career?Liu has said that her decision wasnot driven by infertility: “It just seemed like the right option for me because I was working and I didn’t know when I was going to be able to stop.”This may sound reasonable. If infertility is a good enough reason to use a surrogate, then why not preserving your career? But it is in this way that a “need” for a surrogate transforms into a “right”. If career goals entitle you to a surrogate, then how about failing to find a good enough relationship? Increasing numbers ofsingle men are employing surrogateson that basis. One Japanese businessman has accumulated16 surrogate children“because he wanted a large family”. Rational step by rational step, you enter a dystopian world.Motives also matter when it comes to the surrogate herself. For the vast majority, the driving force is unquestionably the need for money: most surrogates are hard-up young women in poverty-stricken countries paid to rent out their wombs. Some countries, the UK among them, have attempted to change the equation by only permitting “altruistic” surrogacy, where expenses may be paid and nothing more. But ethical pitfalls remain; potential wrong reasons abound.What if a surrogate is driven by the belief she is building an important bond with a couple, only to be cut off once her service is complete? There is every reason for clinics and would-be parents to encourage a special feeling of connection but no obligation to continue it after the baby is handed over. The “best” reason for surrogacy is the halo of pure altruism, which does not depend on how the commissioners then treat you. But we should question that motive in a world where female self-sacrifice has traditionally been glorified. In almost every country, women are far morelikely to be kidney donors, and men the recipients, even though kidney disease is more prevalent among women.At the root of the problem with surrogacy is the fact that human emotions, attitudes, connections and relationships are vitally important, but they cannot be controlled or enforced. We cannot ensure that the relationship between surrogate and would-be parents stays sweet. Neither can we diminish the bond that forms between birth mother and child.Surrogates suffer as a result. And so do children: without that immediate emotional bond, parents seem to find it easier to abandon them. There are too many babiesdumped with the surrogateor in orphanages when commissioners change their minds.Surrogacy is a booming industry – globally it is estimated at £14bn. Between 5,000 and 20,000 babies are handed over every year. British would-be parents are increasingly turning to commercial surrogates incountries blighted by poverty, where it is cheaper. The numbers ofBritons using both commercial and altruistic surrogatesis rising. We should view all this as a problem. Surrogacy can work well, but there are far too many risks it doesn’t.Martha Gill is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On Friday morning, I sat with a group of young renters in a community centre in London. They shared their heartbreaking stories of mould and damp in their homes. Previous governments refused to stand up for them, in part because they didn’t want to ask landlords to make a fair contribution. But this government believes in a basic principle – that every renter deserves a safe and warm home.That is why we announced thatwe will ask landlordsto invest in energy efficiency upgrades that will make homes warmer and cheaper to run. Half of landlords are already doing this and we think it is only fair and right that we ask all landlords to offer decent standards.In doing so, yes, we cut emissions by making homes more efficient, but the real prize is about confronting the cost-of-living pressures families face – standing up for renters and lifting hundreds of thousands of people out of fuel poverty. People voted for change and we are determined to deliver it. This is the climate policy this government believes in.Last Thursday, I was with the prime minister at the UK National Nuclear Laboratory in Preston, announcing aplanning statementto speed up the rollout of nuclear power. This is the route to economic growth, enabling our country to seize the opportunities of AI and clean tech. It is also about wages – many of the workers at the lab came on to the site as apprentices and now have skilled jobs with good pay. These jobs are all too few and far between in Britain, but clean energy offers us a route to bring them back.The net zero economy is the economic growth opportunity of the 21st century. That is why the chancellor has shown such leadership in driving forward with clean energy industries, establishing a national wealth fund to invest in cable factories and clean steel, supporting publicly owned Great BritishEnergyand backing investment in carbon capture jobs in the north-west and Teesside.Despite these facts, it is undeniable that the climate debate is more contested than it has been for years. Siren voices in the Conservative party and Reform UK say we should give up on action. But the truth is that we face a choice as a country: transform our societies with good economic growth in the interests of current and future generations, or give in to those who defend the economic and social injustices of the status quo as we hurtle towards climate disaster, with the Los Angeles wildfires andrecord January temperaturesjust the latest evidence.With the prime minister’s mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower, this government is taking a clear position in this fight. Every family has suffered during the cost-of-living crisis because of our dependence on fossil fuels. Unless we change, our country remains stuck on the rollercoaster of global markets, with wholesale gas prices in January 60% higher than a year ago, prices that will feed through to the bills of the British people.That is why we are racing to protect families with homegrown clean energy that we control – lifting the onshore wind ban, delivering a record-breaking renewables auction and giving the go-ahead to almost three times as much solar in seven months as the previous 14 years combined.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many people believe our country does not work for them. And they are right. From renters in London to apprentices in Preston, the British people support action to protect future generations if we also show that this is a pathway to energy security and good jobs today.

We’re told this again and again, and the warnings might be right – America’s Authors Guild has even just announced plans for a trust mark to be stuck on book covers to show that the book waswritten by a human.Well, I’m going to turn the tables. My publisher is anxiously waiting for me to finish my new novel, a sequel to my previous thrillerThe Turnglass. So let’s see if AI can take the faff – the actual writing bit – out of creative writing.A quick check withChatGPTassures me that yes, it knows my previous book, so I inform it that the sequel begins with Shakespeare investigating the real-life murder of his friend Christopher Marlowe. Early on, Shakespeare encounters a Scottish villain beside a canal. So let’s fire up the AI.“‘Jamie MacIntosh,’ Shakespeare muttered, his hand instinctively moving toward the hilt of his poniard. ‘What foul wind has blown you into my way?’”So far so good.“MacIntosh grinned, his teeth flashing white in the dimness. ‘I might ask the same of you, Bard.’ MacIntosh stepped forward, his broad shoulders filling the alley. ‘Not so fast, Shakes. Word is you’ve been asking the wrong questions to the wrong people. That makes you a problem.’”Nice one, ChatGPT. That’s the stuff. One note, though: MacIntosh isn’tScottishenough. Try again.“MacIntosh stepped forward. ‘No sae fast, Shakes. Word is ye’ve been speirin’ th’ wrang questions tae th’ wrang folk. That maks ye a problem.’”Better! Now. A bit of gratuitous violence, please.“They slammed against the brick wall, dust and mortar cascading around them. Shakespeare brought an elbow down onto MacIntosh’s shoulder. He grabbed MacIntosh’s collar and twisted, using the man’s own weight to roll them both sideways – straight into the canal… ‘Damnation,’ MacIntosh spat. ‘Ye fecht like a deil.’”Not bad. Not bad at all. But, well, MacIntoshstillisn’t Scottish enough, if you ask me. One more try? ChatGPT is happy to oblige.“‘No sae fast, ye preenin’ Sassenach gobshite.’” Blimey.“Word is ye’ve been speirin’ th’ wrang questions.’ The two men circled each other, breath steamin’ in the cauld night air. MacIntosh roared an’ surged, only tae step on a particularly slithery haddock, which sent him flailin’ like a spooked highland coo afore he crashed onto Shakespeare.“Shakespeare shoved MacIntosh straight intae the edge o’ the canal… The Scot let oot a wheeze that sounded like a deflatin’ bagpipe. ‘Ach, Christ’s knees!’ he spat, wipin’ water frae his eyes. ‘Ye fecht like a deranged wild haggis wi’ a grudge.’”Right. Yes, I think that’s sufficiently Scottish.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Monday, the French government, led by François Bayrou, our fourth prime minister in a year, did not fall. Our expectations have sunk so low since the July 2024 snap elections derailed our politics that we are grateful when catastrophes foretold don’t materialise. When Michel Barnier’s government fell before Christmas, it had been in power for just three months and had not managed to pass any sort of legislation. It was the first time since 1962 that a government had been toppled after a vote of non-confidence.The current government did not fall again last week thanks to the Socialists, who seem to be finally “decoupling” from the chaos-hungry far left of Jean-Luc Mélenchon. The Socialists are now the kingmakers and quite enjoy the limelight. Let’s hope they will continue to think with their head and not be tempted by futile revolutionary impulses.Franceneeds a little pragmatism, for a change. Bayrou, a centrist and smooth operator, has achieved one thing: France now has a budget. And even if this budget doesn’t tackle the huge public deficit (6% of GDP), at least it exists. Now we can all return to our favourite pastime: feeling morose.Role modelView image in fullscreenLa Chambre Bleue (1923) by Suzanne Valadon. The first retrospective of the artist in 60 years can be seen at the Pompidou Centre in Paris.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesAn antidote to French morosity can be found at the Pompidou Centre, which is exhibiting the first retrospective in almost 60 years of the great painterSuzanne Valadon. What a fitting tribute to such a strong and unyielding artist before the museum closes its doors for the next five years (those big colourful tubes need a serious overhaul).Valadon, the daughter of an illiterate laundress in Montmartre, first modelled for Renoir, Puvis de Chavanne and Toulouse-Lautrec, before taking to painting. She learned her craft from observing them at work and constantly sketching and drawing from the age of nine. The Pompidou Centre is showing more than 200 of her works in which she spares no one – especially not herself, in unflinching self-portraits that document her slow addiction to alcohol. Championed by Edgar Degas, Valadon’s style transcends all the art movements of her time. In the end, Valadon is Valadon, her own woman. In his affectionate letters, Degas called her “my terrible Maria” (her real first name). On 8 January 1896, he wrote to her: “I love seeing those big and supple brushstrokes of yours. Happy new year.”La belle dameView image in fullscreenNotre-Dame cathedral reopened to the public in December 2024, five years after it was devastated by a fire.Photograph: Andrea Renault/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockFrom the Pompidou Centre, you can hear the bells of Notre-Dame cathedral now ringing many times daily. What a joyful soundtrack to our life after five years of silence in the heart of Paris. Long queues have resumed on the parvis in front, and last week the Paris Tourism Office revealed that the cathedral has already welcomed 800,000 visitors in its first month of reopening, an average of 30,000 a day.A third booked in advance; the others chose to queue, sometimes for hours, to enter. The average time they spent inside, marvelling at the restoration work of artisans, is 32 minutes.Beyond statistics and figures, here is an extraordinary feat of craftsmanship, one that PresidentEmmanuel Macronlast week promised to deliver again by giving the overcrowded Louvre a second entrance by 2030. An international architectural competition will be launched soon and judged before the end of the year. Good luck to the architects who will try to measure up to the genius of IM Pei’s glass pyramid, in front of the world’s largest and most popular museum.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I urge the government to put it back where it belongs – at the heart of the curriculumShirley Ballas is president of the Imperial Society of Teachers of DancingSat 8 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 13.00 ESTShareThe government has promised toput creativity backat the heart of school life, and people across the arts sector who have been campaigning for curriculum change for years will soon learn just how serious it is. For those of us working in dance, publication of theinterim review reportin the coming weeks will be a particularly big deal – or at least, it has the potential to be.Every day we are lucky enough to see how dance changes lives – how it makes us fitter, healthier and more confident, how it takes us into new worlds, brings us together, and keeps us active, physically and mentally. TheSocial Value of Movement and Dancereport found that participating in dance uplifted mental wellbeing for 1.2 million participants, and resulted in 2.7m fewer GP and psychotherapy visits – creating £430m in savings on physical and mental health. Crucially, movement and dance have been found to reach and retain girls, women, and disabled people equally or better than any other forms of activity.Throughout my life, first as a child dancer and then as an adult competing around the world, I have seen how dance inspires creativity and transforms people’s lives, but there is a cost. I always tell people how my mum worked her fingers to the bone so that I could have the classes and gorgeous costumes that I needed to take part. It was hard work then but, in so many ways, it’s even harder for kids today – not just because of the financial cost, but because there are fewer opportunities. As the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy,said last year: “Talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not.”For all the obvious benefits that it brings, and for all the sparkle and glitter ofStrictly Come Dancing, dance in Britain today is in the doldrums and a generation of young people are being denied the life-enhancing experiences that it brings. Dance may be thriving in the private sector, with consistently high numbers ofyoung people participating, but it has all but disappeared in statutory and higher education sectors. Only 16% of schools currently enter pupils for GCSE dance and entries have declined by 59% since 2008, to just 6,723 entries in 2024. Similarly, A-level dance entries have reduced by 58% to just 960 entries in 2024. Dance is a statutory part of the PE curriculum in key stage 1 and 2 (5-11 years) but it is frequently not taught, and where dance is offered it is usually taught by a non-specialist.It is commonly understood that a focus on “core subjects” and a “knowledge-based curriculum” has led to the erosion of creative and practical subjects, particularly dance.The government can put this right by delivering a curriculum that allows dance to do what it does so brilliantly – inspire unique opportunities for creativity by getting children experimenting with movement and using their imaginations to create and interpret stories in new ways. For me, this means promoting it to a core subject able to command the curriculum attention from schools that it – and pupils – genuinely deserve.But realising the power of dance is not just about developing a curriculum. Government policy and funding must go further to recognise these wider opportunities for impacting on the lives of people and the nation beyond the world of education – fromimprovements in mental health, toboosting the confidenceof young people,preventing cardiovascular disease, helping withweight lossandreducing social isolation. Dance has beendescribed as a superpowerand that’s exactly what it is for me and so many other people.The dance sector must play its part too. That is why I am acting in my capacity as president of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) by urging the sector – and everyone who understands the power and potential of dance – to come together and act for its future growth and development.The ISTD is one of the biggest dance exam boards in the UK, but we don’t have all the answers. So we are making a commitment to collaborate with dance agencies, companies, venues and schools, policymakers and funders, to learn from what works, and innovate to build a dance sector in which everyone, no matter who they are, has access to dance. We are ambitious because we want to get the whole of Britain up on its feet and dancing.There’s a lot that we, as a sector, can do to build on these ambitions by mapping everything that’s already happening in dance, and get better at telling the world about the benefits of what we do. Across the country, we see studios becoming dance hubs, and teachers working together, building relationships and making connections with schools and community groups. We can build on these great foundations by exercising our own creativity, coming up with exciting new ideas.Those of us who care about dance should demand a commitment from the government to develop a broad and balanced school curriculum that acknowledges and values its creative and physical benefits. We want to see every child provided with the opportunity to experience a high-quality dance performance before they reach the end of key stage 3 to inspire both the dancers and audiences of the future.Schoolsshould be supported to connect with local dance education experts and institutions. And every school should have a specific dance policy in place, monitor their dance teaching, and provide opportunities for children to achieve dance qualifications with facilities that are clean, safe and fit for purpose.Together we look forward to the results of the curriculum review and to working with the government to help realise the full extent of what we know dance can truly deliver: a fitter, healthier, happier and more confident Britain.Shirley Ballas is head judge on the BBC’sStrictly Come Dancingand president of the Imperial Society of Teachers of DancingExplore more on these topicsDanceOpinionStrictly Come DancingGCSEsA-levelsHealthFitnessSchoolscommentShareReuse this content"

Cheers to that!Lauren O'NeillIt was once a left-field choice but now, like the Aperol spritz before it, my favourite pint has lost its lustre. Anyone for a Murphy’s?Sat 8 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 12.59 ESTShareI’m not sure I can remember exactly when I sensed it. Maybe it was when some of the more gimmickyLondon pubs introduced “stamp cards” to ration out Guinnessafter news of a shortage; maybe it was when I was served the 500th London Guinness rating video by my Instagram algorithm. Regardless of the precise moment the notion arrived, however, I have felt for a while that we are heading for a change when it comes to the pintdu jour. For a few years now, Guinness has been the fashionable choice for millennial and gen Z drinkers, swept up in the aesthetic renaissance of the Good Old-Fashioned Bloody Pub. But I think the tide is turning. This will probably be the year that the Irish stout stops being cool.I’m pretty sure that what will finally usher the Guinness hype train back into the station will be the same thing that came for Aperol spritzes and truffle: overexposure. The Aperol, once a genuinely trendy, vaguely Sex and the City-ish aperitivo-style drink is now a cultural behemoth in its own right – delicious, certainly, but definitely no longer “cool”. And truffle, well … would you like a side of truffle fries for that truffle mac and cheese garnished with truffle oil?Overexposure, of course, is the death knell for cool in most cases (or at least self-conscious, trend-following “coolness”, as I mean it here). This is particularly true amid the one-upmanship of contemporary food and drink culture which, as defined by social media, is always about being the first to find the undiscovered or most novel thing – the “hidden gem”, the bakery and “pasta space” in London’s zone 6 or what have you (“Come with me to the pub in Richmond that regularly floods”). And while Guinness’s current round of popularity began because it was once viewed among younger pubgoers as a left-field choice – an “if you know, you know” order – it now couldn’t be less of a secret.Undeniably, Guinness is everywhere. For the 2024-25 season, it shafted Budweiser to become the official beer of the Premier League, and will hold this honour for the next four years. It is the official beer of rugby’s Six Nations tournament (meaning that for the next month, it is also the official beer of people called Henry). And a few months ago, news broke that the brand will be opening a Guinness Storehouse attraction, described as a “microbrewery and culture hub”, in Covent Garden – despite the fact that London has nothing to do with Guinness or its 250-year-old heritage. Add to this the countless Hinge prompts about“splitting the G”, and the impenetrable gaggle of gilets that pretty much always surrounds Soho’s Guinness Disneyland, otherwise known as the wildly successful Devonshire pub, and you have to admit that the brand’s cool stock is sinking.I don’t speak as a Guinness naysayer. On the contrary, I grew up with a Dublin man and former pub landlord for a grandfather, so reverence for the stout is all but in my blood. As such, Guinness is pretty much the only pint I regularly drink, and I’ll even admit that I’m One Of Those People who has long-winded opinions about their favourite Guinness in London, and who really does believe that it differs in quality depending on where you order it (it’s all in the gas, the installation and the line-cleaning).While Guinness may be at significant risk of losing its edge among, say, people who queue outside bakeries, this hardly matters to its bottom line. It has surpassed cult status, and has in essence become too big to fail. Debra Crew, chief executive ofDiageo, the drinks conglomerate that owns the brand, told press this week that demand for the stout in October and November 2024 had surpassed even the amount called for during St Patrick’s Day celebrations, noting that the clamour was “unprecedented”. Crew also stated that Diageo is spending €200m (£170m) on a new Guinness factory in Kildare to keep supplies up to the level now required.Music to my ears, really – I’m just pleased that while years ago you could walk into a pub and reasonably expect that Guinness wouldn’t be served there, these days I can pretty much get my preferred pint anywhere. And, among all of the arguments to explain the surge in approval for the drink, it is important to acknowledge the obvious one: its smooth texture and subtly rich taste do just combine to offer something genuinely delicious, even when you get a mediocre one.Ultimately, I’m more than happy to let the hype move on to a less obvious drink (over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been in two south-east London pubs that have recently installed the rival stout Murphy’s, owing to local demand – go figure). Because as annoying as social media Guinness chat might be, and despite the extent to which the Schooner Scorer’s camera angles haunt my nightmares (I mean it, don’t Google it), it’s like a wise man called Robbie Williams once sang: “You can’t argue with popularity. Well you could, but you’d be wrong.”Lauren O’Neill is a culture writerExplore more on these topicsBeerOpinionFood & drink industryDiageocommentShareReuse this content"

Saving its mosques and churches would defy himRaja ShehadehThe US president’s real-estate fantasies rely on the erasure of Gaza’s people and culture. Now we must act to preserve themSat 8 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 02.09 ESTShareIt might already be too late to save the homes where many of the people of Gaza have been living and have memories of lives spent there. Or the recollections of people in Ramallah who spent their honeymoons in Gaza by the Mediterranean. Like many others, I too have strong and beautiful experiences of time spent in Gaza. Yet, at this time of almost unimaginable destruction of homes and lives, I turn my mind to thedestruction of cultural heritagesuch as the Great Omari mosque, opened in the seventh century and also known as the Great Mosque of Gaza, whose minaret was partially destroyed and parts of its structure severely damaged. Or the historic Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyrius church, one of the oldest churches in the world, which narrowly escaped destruction for a second time after being struck by an Israeli missile that did not detonate. The fact that consideration is not given to their reconstruction only points to how readily it is accepted that Palestinians in Gaza are not a people who deserve to have their heritage preserved, but a pariah group who can be shunned with impunity.Donald Trump’s announcementis a continuation of Benjamin Netanyahu’s policy of destroying the Gaza Strip pursued during the past 16 months. During Joe Biden’s term as president, the US supported Israel with arms and ammunition; now Trump is supporting it by proposing ethnic cleansing of its people. Without a country of their own, the Palestinians are deemed disposable and stateless, people who have no country and belong to no land, and have no memories and no attachments. If proof were needed of the Palestinians’ attachment to their land, the sight of tens of thousands of them returning to their destroyed homes in the north as soon as they were allowed without a moment’s hesitation, despite knowing that they were returning to devastation and ruin, should suffice. They were aware of Israel’s objective to forcibly remove them from the north and relocate them, and by their immediate return were collectively expressing their refusal to allow this to happen.That all the crimes committed inGazashould be wiped out, forgotten, left unpunished, as Trump envisages through his real estate deal for Gaza, is horrendous and too painful to consider. I am still reeling under the thought of the losses of my human rights and those of my colleagues in Gaza who lost their offices, files and homes. Years of hard work and documentation perishing under the rubble. It is also alarming that ethnic cleansing should be proposed so casually by the leader of one of the strongest countries in the world.For Netanyahu, such an outcome would mean that all the crimes that his policies have led to would be wiped away with the destruction, forgiven and forgotten. That’s what he wants and that’s what he should never get. The fantasy that Palestinian refugees would be absorbed by the countries around them is not new. It was David Ben-Gurion in 1948 who predicted that in a generation or two the refugees would forget. They never did. Now many of the Palestinians from the areas that becameIsraeland who took refuge in Gaza are being threatened with expulsion.Enforcement of Trump’s proposal looks unlikely. Yet, as long as Israel is in control of the borders of the Gaza Strip, and if the US does not lend its support tothe third phase of the ceasefirewhen reconstruction is due to start, Israel can in effect stop any funding directed to reconstruction, as well as prevent the importation of material needed for reconstruction of the Strip from entering. This would leave the Palestinians living under intolerable conditions. It was the failure to reconstruct what was destroyed by Israeli bombardment in the 2014 war that led to future wars against the Strip.View image in fullscreenPalestinians pray at the Great Omari mosque in 2017.Photograph: Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/ReutersThe present war has not ended, but there is no mention yet of any negotiations for resolving the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. I had some hope that after witnessing the gravity andextent of the destructionIsrael has caused to its Palestinian neighbours, and the suffering that the Israeli hostages endured over the long period of their incarceration in Gaza, the people in Israel would be brought to their senses and there would be revulsion on both sides against the continuation of the ravages of war and military conflict. Yet this seems far fetched.An international effort at reconstructing the Great Omari mosque and Saint Porphyrius church would indicate that the world is refusing Trump’s attempt at turning the fate of Palestinians in Gaza into a real estate project. A more humane approach than to transform Gaza into a Riviera would be a patient reconstruction of these two monuments of world heritage, as the start of rebuilding the devastated Strip. It would be a partial symbolic expiation for what was done to the people of Gaza and the world.Raja Shehadeh is a Palestinian lawyer and writer, and founder of the human rights organisation Al-Haq.

I have witnessed this exchange in a plodding crime drama:Dad: What kind of sicko fucks their stepmom?Son [aggrieved]: I introduced you to her!Within seconds of this dialogue a knife will fly through the air and mortally wound someone in the head, setting off a violent shower of gunfire. Bodies will fall; audiences will weep. I have watched every 0% film on Rotten Tomatoes’ list of theWorst Movies of All Timeand have lived to tell the tale.View image in fullscreenTurkey crowned … Theo James and Billy Bob Thornton in London Fields.Photograph: Steffan Hill/Head Gear Films/AllstarCurrently 40 films on Rotten Tomatoes have earned two ignoble distinctions. First, they’ve received a 0% approval rating. Second, they’ve been reviewed 20 or more times, meaning they’re usually larger productions, not small indie misfires, thus granting them a position on the website’s Worst Films of All Time list (take away that second criteria, and the net widens; at the time of writing, 572 films available on streaming make the cut). I discovered this list last winter, after reading Martin Amis’s novel London Fields and learning of its ill-fated film adaptation, a curious project that began in 2001 under David Cronenberg, and after nearly two decades and many false starts – including a brief time under Michael Winterbottom – resulted in a 2018 film by Hollywood music video director Mathew Cullen that boasted a starry cast (including Billy Bob Thornton and Amber Heard) and debuted to uniformly negative reviews: “A trashy, tortured misfire from beginning to end,” ruled theNew York Times.I wondered just how bad it was. I wondered just how bad they all were. And so this winter, a routine was established. I would settle on my sofa and load up a stinker. I thought it would be fun, in the way that indulging in things that are generally bad for you is fun, but instead I found my heart growing heavier each time, my critical faculties grinding to dust. My attitude to films began to resemble the feeling one has towards food after a particularly vigorous session at an all-you-can-buffet: no more. After I watched film No 34, I was convinced I had seen a masterpiece, before realising it merely had a basic understanding of suspense. But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me take you back to the start.September 2024. The first film I watched was Cabin Fever, a 2016 remake of director-actor Eli Roth’s 2002 cult horror. Five university students venture into the country for a weekend away, only to be terrorised by a deadly flesh-eating virus. The townspeople are unlovely caricatures of unsophistication, with a habit of saying things like: “What did I tell you about biting city folk!” (admonishing a cannibalistic child) and, “Got to get me another hog!” (checking on their hogs). The film’s gender politics could be described as “spicy”: around the living room fire the first night, the two female students talk about masturbation in front of the gawping boys, and I could not tell if this was empowering or not, though it passes the Bechdel test in a very literal way.The 2016 Cabin Fever was ruled a forgettable remake that did not add anything to the original. Pointlessness was a defining feature in the next few films, which seemed like lifeless approximations of better ones in their respective genres. Hard Kill, a 2020 Bruce Willis action vehicle, sees the star as a CEO who has to save his kidnapped science genius daughter (played by Lala Kent of reality TV show Vanderpump Rules fame). There’s the usual trappings of the genre: gun battles, a showdown between rivals, and a mission to “save the world” by preventing a technology called Project 275 falling into the wrong hands, though it’s never clear what Project 275 is. Watching the film, you get a vague approximation of what it’s trying to do, but its true meaning eludes you.I found my heart growing heavier each time, my critical faculties grinding to dustDark Crimes, meanwhile, is a gritty noir with Jim Carrey as a Polish detective whose investigations bring him into the orbit of a mysterious woman played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. With stylish cinematography, it’s one of the more technically accomplished works – within the 0% club, the quality of films varies wildly – but is boring and takes itself too seriously. I was more excited to watch Homecoming, a kidnapping drama featuring Mischa Barton as an obsessive ex-girlfriend. It was not great – a far less interesting version of Misery – but I did feel invested in the plot and characters, and such things were beginning to feel rare and special.I had anticipated funny glorious failure; what I saw were things that fell into the forgettable middle. But that makes sense. After all, Rotten Tomatoes is not a reliable indication of quality. As an aggregator of reviews that have been flattened into binary judgments of “fresh” or “rotten”, it doesn’t distinguish between films that are mediocre or divisive. A film that is merely good but uncontroversial can emerge as a 90% masterpiece; a 0% film can be blandly fine, but fail to prompt any enthusiasm. Not all films on the worst-ever list have been reviewed by the Guardian, but the ones that have often fell into the blandly mediocre camp, receiving two out of five stars – a rating that amounts to “bad, but not worth a panning”. Some of the most beloved worst films of all time – Tommy Wiseau’s The Room, so silly that it still attracts rowdy audiences all over the world, to the Hitchcock-inspired misfire Birdemic: Shock and Terror – have eked out some positive reviews (Birdemic,Variety ruled, has “a goofy, almost surrealist charm”) and so don’t make the list.The famously slated Staying Alive, the Sylvester Stallone-directed sequel to Saturday Night Live with John Travolta, is featured in many bad film lists, but viewed against the otherRotten Tomatoes0%-ers – where it has also earned a place – it seemed competent, if uninspired.Another unloved sequel was Return to the Blue Lagoon, the follow-up to the 1980 film that starred a 14-year-old Brooke Shields as one half of a telegenic duo marooned on a tropical island. The original Blue Lagoon was criticised for its shallowness, sentimentalism and for sexualising minors; the sequel repeats the same formula, with a 15-year-old Milla Jovovich in Shields’ place. It features the same cerulean-blue vistas and romanticised snapshots of life in the wilderness. The only drama happens in the last 10 minutes of the film; everything else washes over you like a designer perfume TV advertisement, all glamour and gorgeousness and a total void of meaning. My hypothesis that the 0% fims were ultimately more boring than offensive was soon tested by 2003’s National Lampoon’s Gold Diggers. It is dismissive and mean-spirited about nearly everybody, from its weedy young protagonists, who marry a pair of rich older women in the hope of killing them and collecting the money; to the women themselves, ghoulish in their “old age” (fiftysomething); to the side characters who are racist caricatures. Bad comedies are the most difficult to sit through. Terrible films in other genres can become accidental comedies, but a thing that tries and fails to make you laugh tends to fill you with hate. And so it was with Adam Sandler’s The Ridiculous 6, a western satire with the lethal combination of being stupid and charmless (another Blazing Saddles-inspired 0%-er, Wagons East – the last film that featured beloved comedian John Candy – seemed full of heart in comparison).View image in fullscreen‘A critic. Scatter!’ … Taylor Lautner, Luke Wilson and Adam Sandler in The Ridiculous Six.Photograph: Netflix/AllstarDid any comedies rise above the crowd? Some, at least, seemed to soften with time. 1993’s Look Who’s Talking Now – the third instalment in the Look Who’s Talking comedies, with John Travolta and Kirstie Alley – attaches the voices of Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton to live-action dogs, a practice that seemed very dated, and so oddly charming. It was maybebecauseof this, and the fact that the film was fairly inoffensive, that made it seem generally unobjectionable. Meanwhile, reviews at the time ruled 1990’s Problem Child, a comedy about a dastardly orphan as too insipid and too mean. But 30 years later, at a time when “TikTok prankster arrested after allegedly spraying bug killer on grocery store produce” is alegitimate news headline, these seemed neither excessively stupid nor cruel but in fact rather mild.It was the horror films that I had been dreading – I am a coward – but it turns out a bad horror isn’t frightening at all. A successful horror requires careful world-building and attention to logic and suspense; fail to do that and the result is underwhelming and even funny. Kate Beckinsale’s game turn as an architect in a haunted house couldn’t save The Disappointments Room from becoming one long music video featuring creepy children. One Missed Call (2008), a remake of the cult Japanese horror, meanwhile, is undone by unintentional hilarity. In it, a ghost trapped in a mobile phone wreaks havoc on the living. “What if her spirit’s there, moving through the phones, attacking people?” one character asks to no one’s great interest, as elsewhere a lone ghostly hand bursts out of the pavement brandishing a mobile. It’s true that we would soon all become haunted by our phones – but just not like this. Not like this at all.Among the films on the list, one is known as the worst of the worst: 2002’s terribly named Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever. It’s been reviewed 118 times, the most for a film with a 0% rating, and so tops Rotten Tomatoes’ Worst Movies of All Time list, where it’s deemed a “startlingly inept film” featuring “wall-to-wall action without a hint of wit, coherence, style, or originality”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu play secret agents – Ecks and Sever – who team up against a rogue boss. (Why the film’s title pits them against each other is another mystery in a bottomless pit of mysteries.) Ballistic is a parade of explosion after explosion, shootout after shootout, with plenty of scenes of a taciturn leather-clad Liu strutting around, a beleaguered Banderas seeking revenge, all thinly tied together by a barely there plot.In general, high-concept action films were the best to watch; whatever inanity was going on could be allayed by high-paced action set-pieces, ambitious stunts and campy villains. Not every one delivered, though: take Gotti, the biopic of mafia crime boss John Gotti with John Travolta (the actor appears three times on this list). With its frenetic pacing and multiple time jumps, it’s impossible to follow. Watching it in a post-lunch haze, I rewound the first 10 minutes about 10 times before realising I wasn’t the problem, it was the film. The 2014 thriller Left Behind stepsinto the very big shoes of Con Air– Nicolas Cage, at the helm of a plane ride that goes wrong – and spectacularly fails to fill them. A Christian action film that explores the aftermath of the rapture, it is funny when it wants to be serious. When passengers from his plane disappear mid-flight – ie the blessed ascending to heaven – Cage tells his colleagues, “It was God”, with perhaps 30% conviction. Why did he agree to do it? “My brother Marc is a Christian pastor,” Cage has explained. “he said, ‘Nicky, you’ve really got to do this.’ When I saw how passionate he is, I wanted to do the film for my brother, too.”I gave myself until December to complete the list. By then, I turned to the 13 films that weren’t available on streaming, which involved ordering DVDs and rescuing an old Xbox One from the attic (five films weren’t available on UK streaming or DVDs at all). In total, I watched too many films to name here, but the theme that emerged was one of brutal downfalls. Hollywood can be a miserable business, where the highs are fleetingly high and the lows can be mercilessly low, and some of the films here proved it. Italian film-maker Roberto Benigni charmed Hollywood with his 1997 triple Oscar-winning Life Is Beautiful. His next project, a live-action version of Pinocchio, bombed in the US, where reviewers were put off by not only the premise – an adult Benigni gallivanting around as a boy puppet – but also the awful dubbing. Chinese director Chen Kaige stormed Cannes with Palme d’Or-winning Farewell My Concubine before making his first English-language production, Killing Me Softly, with Heather Graham and Joseph Fiennes, an erotic thriller that plays like questionable fanfiction. And while toy giant Mattel might like us to believe it debuted triumphantly into the world of cinema with 2023’s Barbie, its first attempt – the 2016 superhero film Max Steel – was a washout.I saved London Fields, the film that led me down this path, for the end. It felt like a poetic conclusion. It was an unusually sunny morning – it was as if the weather knew – but on screen, Martin Amis’s London looked defiantly ugly, shrouded in a gothic oversaturated fog and teetering on social collapse as Billy Bob Thornton, Theo James and Jim Sturgess’s characters vie for the attention of clairvoyant-seductress Nicola Six, played by Amber Heard. Filled with gravelly lines pulled straight from the novel such as “This is London. There are no fields, only fields of operation and observation” set to self-serious montages, the film strives to be a sexy noir and comes across more like a 2000s pop-metal music video.“It was the hardest movie I ever did,”Billy Bob Thornton saidahead of its release. “We were squeezing 10lb of shit into a 5lb bag. We didn’t have enough money or enough time […] We hope we do you proud with the film. If we let you down, I apologise in advance, but we sure gave it our best.” It’s a moving quote, all the more so considering the outcome (the director and producers fought for control over the film. As was the case with other films on this list, the director lost, and has distanced himself from the final result.) Some films soar, others fall, but all are sprawling endeavours involving great amounts of work. To have it fail, after all that, is tragically human.Ripe for a kicking: Hollywood’s love-hate relationship with Rotten TomatoesRead moreAs the credits to London Fields rolled, I wondered what I had learned from this three-month odyssey through the boring and the bad, the underwhelming and the outrageous, the generic and the questionably unique. It was difficult to compare them, but the worst of the worst, for me, was National Lampoon’s Gold Diggers. It is hard to compete with a comedy that lands no jokes and is outright offensive (the same could be said of The Ridiculous Six, though that at least that had the money to produce interesting sets). The worst action film was, for pure incomprehensibility, Hard Kill, while 2011’s Beneath the Darkness was the worst horror, as the killer (a magnificent scenery-chewing Dennis Quaid) is identified early on, with the rest of the film dedicated to the uninteresting logistics of catching him.While good art can be transcendent and awe-inducing, bad art at its best reminds us of our humility and vulnerability and the inevitability of failure. We all feel the desire to create; we all see grand ambitions fall apart. Plenty of the films in this list were corporate cash-grabs and paint-by-numbers productions that could have been generated by AI. Beyond them, it’s those moments of humanity – funny, absurd, too close to home – that will stay with me. That bizarre piece of dialogue; the performance that tries too hard; Nicolas Cage signing up to a questionable script because it would make his brother happy. It’s said that great art reveals something about the human condition. The best bad art does the same thing, too. I probably won’t revisit any of these films, and did not find a great misunderstood gem, but have been given a crash course in the ways things just go simply and gloriously wrong. There are so many.Explore more on these topicsFilmRotten TomatoesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now it is to be knocked down as part of a huge developmentRowan Moore’s viewMorgan OforiSat 8 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 11.25 ESTShareWhen judges awarded Salford’s Centenary Building the inauguralStirling prizein 1996, they declared it “a dynamic, modern and sophisticated exercise in steel, glass and concrete”.The recognition as Britain’s best new building from the Royal Institute of British Architects cementedSalfordas an emblem of emerging northern architecture.But last month Salford city councilapproved the demolitionof the Centenary Building – which has not been in use since at least 2021– despite vocal opposition from preservation campaigners and the architecture industry.The Crescent partnership, which includes Salford city council, English Cities Fund (ECF) and Salford University, which owns the building, said in a joint statement that while “careful consideration has been given to the history of the building with multiple options explored”, it will be demolished next month as part of the comprehensive development of Adelphi village, an area surrounding the university. The project is part of a £2.5bn plan that aims to deliver housing. “While the Centenary Building has been part of the university estate for a number of decades, it is now unecological to run, with major structural, heating and ventilation flaws throughout,” the partnership said.Critics, however, say the decision is “wasteful and irresponsible” and are urging the partnership to change their minds. The Twentieth Century Society criticised the decision not to list the building and said it wasn’t too late for the university to reconsider its plans. “The decision has allowed the local authority to wave through demolition without adequate scrutiny,” said its director, Catherine Croft. Opened in 1995 by the Duke of Edinburgh, in the area east of the River Irwell, and originally designed for the University of Salford’s school of electrical engineering department, the building was used by the faculty of art and design technology upon completion.Centenary Building locatorStephen Hodder, the architect responsible for the Centenary Building, said he was disappointed, and felt that history was being erased, as it had been built to mark 100 years since the formation of the university. “The question has always got to be, has that building outlived its usefulness? Georgian buildings were candle lit, and then electricity was introduced,” Hodder said. “So a building has got to be capable of being upgraded in its life.“It was part of the brief that the building needed to be flexible. There’s a servicing strategy within that building to allow it to be changed and upgraded.“My reading of the situation is somebody’s taking the commercial decision over the cost of it being upgraded.”The Twentieth Century Society tried to have the building listed by Historic England, but the public body concluded in its initial assessment report that, when considered against the high standard required for buildings of its age, the Centenary Building lacked the special interest in a national context required to merit listing. Previous attempts to adapt the building for a different use have also failed – proposed plans to convert it into a primary school were shelved in 2018. Until 2021, the Channel 4 reality seriesThe Circlehad editing suites in the building while filming in a residential block opposite.The Twentieth Century Society has described the demolition as “wasteful and irresponsible”, and critics point to the carbon footprint of the construction industry. In 2022 England generated 63m tonnes of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste. Making bricks and steel creates vast amounts of CO2, with cement alone causing 8% of global emissions.AHistoric England studyin 2019 stated that embodied emissions from refurbished or retrofitted buildings accounted for a minimum of 2% of a building’s total emissions over 60 years. That figure rises to 28% in demolished and new buildings. Salford city council has a target of 2038 for net zero carbon emissions. Last month, Scott Anderson, a mature construction student at Salford University walking by the Centenary Building, said there were other buildings on campus that were not fit for purpose. “The construction industry is a beast that needs to be fed,” he said. “If you drive around central Manchester long enough you’ll see a new [building] going up every two minutes. If anyone had any sense in councils, they would just strip some of the old works out, put something new in. But there’s more money to be made when you tear the whole thing down and build another big thing. Everybody makes money off that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has now been vacant for a third of its built life.“The [redevelopment] project is part of the £2.5bn Crescent Salford masterplan which will deliver housing, to cater to a broad range of residents.

In others, she is reading, relaxing and sleeping, most often with a high-neck blouse, a ribbon or a scarf covering a tracheotomy scar.While her face is familiar, little else is known of the artist’s eldest child. Despite her fragile health, Marguerite joined the French resistance, was tortured by the Gestapo, faced deportation to a Nazi concentration camp, and remained a discreet and comforting presence in Matisse’s life until the day he died in November 1954, aged 84.An exhibition opening in April at the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris will bring together more than 110 works – paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures and ceramics – featuring Marguerite, many from private collections and never before seen in public inFrance. “We think we know all there is to know about Matisse, but here we have an image of him that is completely unknown to the public,” Charlotte Barat-Mabille, one of the exhibition curators, told theObserver.View image in fullscreenHenri, Amélie and Marguerite Matisse in 1907.Photograph: Archives Henri Matisse“And while Marguerite’s face is very familiar around the world from Matisse’s portraits of her, apart from art experts and historians, very few people know much about her.”Henri Matisse, the son of a wealthy grain merchant from northern France, was working as a court administrator inPariswhen he was confined to bed after an attack of appendicitis at the age of 20. To combat the boredom, his mother bought him art supplies and he discovered what he called “a kind of paradise” in art, much to his father’s deep disappointment.Marguerite was born in 1894 during the painter’s relationship with one of his models, Caroline Joblau, when he was in Paris studying art. Unusually for the time, Matisse recognised the child when the couple split. Four years later, when he married Amélie Noellie Parayre, he brought Marguerite to live with his new family, where she was brought up with two half-brothers, Jean and Pierre.At the age of six, Marguerite contracted diphtheria and had an emergency tracheotomy. The damage to her larynx caused pain and discomfort for the next 20 years, interrupting her schooling and leaving her confined to home, where she spent hours with her father in his studio.Matisse’s portraits from this time show Marguerite wearing a black ribbon or high-neck blouses to cover the scar. The most familiar of these isMargueritewith a Black Cat, completed in 1910, and hailed as bold and radical when exhibited in Berlin and New York. Matisse preferred to keep the work rather than sell it.Matisse’s paintings and drawings of his daughter proliferated during the first world war and portray an elegant young woman, stylishly dressed and wearing elaborate hats. In 1920, Marguerite, then aged 26, underwent a final, painful operation to repair the scar on her neck and was subsequently painted without any accessories.View image in fullscreenMatisse’s Marguerite with a Black Cat, completed in 1910.Photograph: Georges Meguerditchian/RMN-GPThree years later, Marguerite married the writer and art critic Georges Duthuit. Although she had taken up painting and succeeded in being included in group exhibitions during the war, she stopped producing her own work in 1925, and devoted herself to being Matisse’s assistant and agent, meticulously overseeing the printing of his engravings, supervising exhibitions, cataloguing his work and dealing with demands for it.“As Matisse’s daughter, she was brought up with painting and it was natural to her. However, being Matisse’s daughter wasn’t easy, and although she had a natural talent and a good eye, she gave it up,” Barat-Mabille said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are very touching,” Barat-Mabille said.In 1935, separated from Duthuit and living alone in Paris with their toddler son, Claude, Marguerite attempted to forge a career as a fashion designer with a collection sent to be shown in London. It was not a success.During the second world war, she and her stepmother were active in the French Resistance. In 1945, Marguerite was denounced to the Gestapo in Rennes, and was arrested and tortured. After several months in prison, she was placed on the final deportation to the Ravensbrück concentration camp when Allied bombing disrupted the train carrying her and the other prisoners, and she escaped before reaching Germany.Matisse’s final portraits of Marguerite date from 1945, and reflect his concern over the danger and suffering she endured during the war.Marguerite Duthuit Matisse died in Paris in 1982, aged 87, while still cataloguing her father’s work.“As well as being an occasion to pay tribute and rediscover Matisse the artist, this exhibition allows us to see a more personal side to him.

I left at 15 and learned my craft by playing pianos in pubs.Buddy’s Songkickstarted my career. I starred with Roger Daltrey. Acting wasn’t what I wanted to do – I went for the part because I thought there might be a record deal at the end of it, which there was. I’d been sending cassettes of my songs to record labels and been turned down. The One and Only came from the soundtrack to the film.When I performedonTop of the Popsmy life became crazy. Suddenly, everywhere I went there was a gaggle of girls and paparazzi. The One and Only got to number one all over Europe and into the Top 10 in the States. Things turned upside down.I understandwhen I see young artists have their exhaustion moment – I once went to seven countries in one day. Very instantly your life is not your own. You have success in different territories all at the same time and you have to go and visit them. My brother and I were away from home for two years.I never reallyunderstood the hysteria of fame. I’d come face to face with a fan and they’d just scream in my face. Things are different now.Once the record labelsdropped me, I went off the rails. I drank and took drugs to escape the fact I thought I was a washed up has-been at 22. I closed the lid on my feelings, which wasn’t very healthy.It was pretty instantwhen I met Krissy. She was 20, I was 22. She walked into a pub in Mortlake, London, near where I lived, to celebrate 4 July – she’s American. I asked if I could buy her a drink. She said, “I’ll have a pint of lager.” In my head I thought: “Marry me.”Our secret?Spending time away from each other. It’s true that absence makes the heart grow fonder. But there are many other secrets. Communication is crucial: we don’t hide anything from each other.My dad once said,“Don’t believe the hype – none of it’s real.” I didn’t really take that in at the time, but I do now, especially as I’m a father myself. Our kids are 23, 21 and 18 – they are what’s important in life.I have no regrets.There are things in my career I’d have done differently but they don’t keep me up at night. I believe everything brings you to where you are.I’m happy to be home.I’ve been living in the desert of LA for the past 12 years, but we’re now in leafy Surrey, near where I grew up. Life has come full circle. I used to do a paper round nearby.We’ve not lived herelong and every day is a blessing. You have to look at life that way and take it by the horns. That’s what age has done to me. I’m loving being in my 50s. I feel liberated. I’m having the time of my life.Chesney Hawkes releases his new album, Living Arrows, on 28 February.

Bacchanalia, bust-ups, romance and raging parties, apparentlyCharlotte EdwardesSat 8 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 12.56 ESTShareImagine a hospital room: in the bed is a cheerful man, white hair in a Tintin quiff. His eyes are Swedish blue, his lashes a fine blond fan. He has a nebuliser strapped to his face, he’s taking deep breaths so that the steroid can loosen the bronchitis that has seized his chest. Outside is the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai and beyond, hills of tropical rainforest. But our patient is focused inward, mind ablaze. He is watching scenes unfold – a hotel, flame-lit, characters in frenzied dialogue. There are monks, mafia. Somewhere, echoing gunshots, causing his limbs to twitch. Over the next two nights the entire season ofThe White Lotus3 rolls before him, “as a fever dream”. The patient is Mike White, creator, writer and director of the HBO blockbuster. “By morning, I’m like, I just came up with the storyline! It was wild. I felt like I’d done crack.”White – wiry, smiley, with a voice that vibrates emotion – immediately got on to his producer, David Bernad. Bernad has worked with White for nearly 20 years and is a solid, unflustered man, the perfect foil for White’s creative mania. As White relayed how he’d hallucinated the new season’s plot, and the stories had come cosmically through the magic of Thai spirits, Bernad thought “interesting” and turned his mind to casting, locations and crew. “Mike is a very singular film-maker,” he says.For those unfamiliar, The White Lotus is a prickly satire, set in a luxury resort, with a superb ensemble cast – most memorably Jennifer Coolidge as Tanya, a pampered alcoholic, forever on the brink. Commissioned as a one-off in lockdown, the surprise hit pulled in 10 million viewers per episode, eclipsing Succession and winning a sweep of Emmys and Golden Globes. There’s a framing device: each season opens with a body, then rewinds so the action can slow-boil over seven days, but the content, as White puts it, “shape shifts”. The first season, set in Hawaii, focused on wealth privilege (who can forget Olivia and Paula with their Freud andFanon, and looks like well-aimed grenades). The second, in Sicily, was a bedroom farce (with a sensational side order of “high-end gays”).This time, White, 54, draws on his obsession with spirituality, west versus east, “kind of a heaven and hell”, Bernad says. The first seasons cost an estimated $3m an episode, but three is a monster: eight episodes and a sprawling cast including Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the “I’m-done-with-rich-white-people” spa manager from season one. The new hotel guests are three midlife blondes (Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Leslie Bibb), an upstanding southern family (Jason Isaacs, Parker Posey, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Sarah Catherine Hook and Sam Nivola) and a raddled misery guts with his young, Mancunian “let’s get fucked up” girlfriend (Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood). Probably most famous in the lineup is Lisa of K-pop bandBlackpink(real name Lalisa Manobal), making her acting debut in the Thai cast, alongside London-born Tayme Thapthimthong, who trained with the military before moving to Thailand as a singer and bodyguard.View image in fullscreenSarah Catherine Hook on set …View image in fullscreen… and with White Lotus family members (from left) Jason Isaacs, Parker Posey, Patrick Schwarzenegger and Sam Nivola. Photographs: Fabio Lovino and HBOTo say the show is hotly anticipated is to understate the frenzy around the franchise. Where else could you see a story about families on holiday so perfectly crescendo into a ketamine-fuelled gay orgy? When the latest trailer dropped, however, fans had questions. Why does it look like an action thriller? Where is the subtlety, the knowingness, the gleeful digs at the very class in whose point of view the show is framed?Mostly, though, they are still in mourning for Jennifer Coolidge, whose character was killed off in the season two finale. Mike White, too. “I miss her a lot,” he says. “Not just as an actress, but as a person on the set. She was such an emotional part of the show.” So Mike White bottled lightning twice. The question is: can he do it again?All of which brings me to Thailand, midway through filming. This season’s White Lotus is the Four Seasons in Koh Samui, but it’s the first day of shooting at the Rosewood in Phuket, where the restaurant scenes take place. It’s hot – so hot that on a boat the previous day, one crew member’s Crocs melted into the floor.In the press tent, a handful of writers are watching a monitor while we wait for the cast to be brought over. Bernad raises his voice over thecicadasso he can explain to us the scene being shot. Isaacs, Posey and Hook, of the family from North Carolina, are having dinner. Their two sons (played by Schwarzenegger and Nivola) are elsewhere “on an adventure”. There’s a conversation about Buddhism –“boo-dism” in Posey’s character’s southern drawl – but it’s clear from Isaacs’s face that something is very awry. Across the table Posey, in an off-­the-shoulder orange blouse, seems oblivious, consulting a menu and ordering wine. Her husband, she says, wants something not too spicy. “It’s his I-B-S.”Then Posey stumbles in her pronunciation of a Thai dish and there’s a shout: “Cut!” Posey fans herself furiously. “I am burning up,” she says, looking around. An ice pack is passed. She puts it in her armpit and asks someone to scratch her back. We watch White scuttle over to the table. “Awesome!” he’s saying; they’re all doing great. As he’s returning to his directing area, he pauses, turns. “What do you think?” he says, one finger raised to his lips. “Is there a world where maybe … ?” We can’t hear his next instruction, but he’s animated, his expressions elastic. In the tent, Bernad is saying Posey’s character thinks she’s better than everyone else.We watch the scene go again, and then what feels like 23 times, White sometimes squawking with laughter from behind his monitor. “Mike will not move on until he’s happy,” Rothwell explains when she visits to chat about the show. “That’s what I find myself saying to each of the actors. Because everyone wants to show up and do the job and not fail Mike. And I’m like, ‘Listen: he will not move on until he’s happy. You can take that to the bank.’ And you see everyone’s shoulders go down, like, OK.”The actors have signed NDAs, so instead of plot, we hear about life on set, the outbreaks ofdengueand food poisoning. There are monitor lizards as big as crocodiles in one hotel; snakes, monkeys, tarantulas. There are frogs the size of your thumb, which interrupt takes with a sound “likePavarotti”. Many seem relieved with a change of scene in Phuket – they’ve been months in Koh Samui, which can get “claustrophobic.”View image in fullscreenFellow cast members Walton Goggins, Aimee Lou Wood …View image in fullscreen… Dom Hetrakul and Natasha Rothwell. Photographs: Fabio Lovino/HBOIndeed, for the entire seven-month duration of filming, actors do not live in rented accommodation, as they might on other films. They live on set. That’s right, they live in the White Lotus hotel, with one other, cut off from their worlds, in the searing heat. Isaacs says, “It’s a kind of crucible, a five-star gilded cage. There’s no question that sometimes it is absolutely fabulous, and sometimes it’s Lord of the Flies.”Although The White Lotus is filmed in relative luxury, with housekeepers and personal butlers and an open bar, actors are expected to pick up incidentals. Goggins toldStephen Colberthe was shocked to discover a bottle of prosecco cost $150. “Six weeks into filming, I go to pay my bill. You’re telling me Thai-spiced cashews cost that much? I thought I had maybe, like, five. And they said, ‘No, you had 30.’”Bernad calls it an “adult summer camp” and says he’s never been on a set like it: “Everyone there is just part of the production, but there’s kids and spouses running around, too.” Arnas Fedaravičius, who plays the hot Russian yogi assigned to the three midlife women, says there’s “a weird, disconnected feeling. I’m here for work but it’s a very vacation atmosphere.”Some days, the heat makes work difficult. They can’t use air conditioning because of the noise while shooting. On film, they have to look as if they’re having a good time on holiday, when in truth they can barely function.View image in fullscreenShooting poolside.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOBut it’s not all work. There’s swimming, boats, boxing school. They can learn Thai – or Italian, Bernad says, as many crew came with them from Sicily. “Some people’s project is their body,” Isaacs says, “building a 10-pack or losing half their weight. Others work on spiritual things; meditating, looking deep inside. I’m a tennis player, so rather shallowly I spend whenever I can on a court.” And in the evening? “People are away from home and, you know, there’s a lot of bacchanalian behaviour going on. I’m not telling stories out of school. It’s just grownups doing whatever we like. Thailand is a place full of parties, and we are not immune.”Of things most often said about Mike White, the first must be that he’s “obsessed” with reality TV. “He’s very inspired by it,” Bernad says. So much so that he’s been a contestant on Survivor – and not a wafty celebrity version, but the hard-nosed real show. He proved a wily tactician and won second place. Parallels with The White Lotus are not hard to see: the conceit is premised on characters thrown together in a closed-off world with the heat turned to boil.The second is that he runs an unusual set. So, unlike most big-budget US TV shows, there is no writers’ room, just White. Every sparking word comes from his own brain. Also: all cast, no matter how famous, must audition. Isaacs, who played Draco Malfoy’s dad in Harry Potter (and whom Bernad suggested to White, having watched Death of Stalin on a plane), was surprised. “I went, ‘Tape? With Mike?’ And they go, ‘No, with a casting director.’ ‘Really? OK.’ I don’t want to get too big for my boots, but I walked through Times Square and my face was on like five different billboards.’” But Isaacs did it, as he’d done aged 25, straight out of drama school, and admits, “I was incredibly nervous.”The third thing said about Mike White? To a man, they call him a genius.At sundown, White comes to the press tent and sits on a plastic stool. He says Thailand was a good canvas to get into the “conflict” people have when they seek “some kind of spiritual experience but get caught up in baser impulses”. This is especially true of Bangkok, he says: “An everything-goes kind of city.”He wasn’t sure until his hospital bed epiphany what the show would be about, but he knew Buddhism would feature. He had a “little Buddhist self-help phase” in 2004, after he suffered a breakdown while making a show for Fox – coincidentally called Cracking Up. “I got really into the concepts,” he says, forehead shining in the heat. “So I just thought maybe that would be something that was rich. But I didn’t know what the characters were, how to organise the ideas. I was just sort of hoping I would find inspiration.”For the first season, HBO approached White because they knew he was a fast writer. “It was, like, gun to my head, ‘Come up with something’ and I was so bored during the pandemic, I thought, ‘I’ll do anything.’ I don’t usually do this, but I just started writing … I was like, ‘I have three weeks to write these scripts.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He thinks about this for a second. “There are some elements that are very personal, and there are some parts that I’m just like, ‘Wow, who wrote this?’ So, yeah, who knows where shit comes from.”While his work is not autobiographical, he certainly draws on experience. After his breakdown, he wrote and directedEnlightened, starring Laura Dern, about a sales executive who unravels after an affair and has an epiphany while swimming with turtles in Hawaii.When White was 11, his father, a minister at the Covenant church, in Pasadena, California, came out to the family but stayed closeted to the outside world for another decade. “I guess it made me very skeptical about how people present themselves,” he told the New York Times. “What’s really the truth. But in a way, it was also really liberating, especially for me to be given the idea that there is no way to live this normative lifestyle.” He went to an east coast university, but returned to LA and secured a job as a writer on Dawson’s Creek. He appeared on the reality TV show Amazing Race twice (with his dad). He wrote The Good Girl, starring Jennifer Aniston, and School of Rock for his friend Jack Black. Later, on the advice ofShirley MacLaine, he consulted a past-life regression guide and afterwards commissioned portraits of his 14 past lives. One was a medieval soldier who died in battle, another a Maori tribesman. Another still was a Gatsby-era alcoholic whose boat sank, and there was a Cuban waitress who he said “slept with all my friends’ boyfriends and I got an STD and no one would help me and I died in a flophouse”.View image in fullscreenBeach buddies (from left) Morgana O’Reilly, Arnas Fedaravičius, Christian Friedel, Dom Hetrakul and Lalisa Manobal.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOWhite has said he identified with Armond (Murray Bartlett), the put-upon hotel manager in the first season of The White Lotus, and with Quentin (Tom Hollander), the English expat queen in season two. He also relates to Quinn Mossbacher, the 16-year-old boy who jettisons a life of screens and privilege to run away with a Hawaiian canoe crew (“Maybe it’s my Survivor experiences”).But in his life, White has also been – like all of us, he believes – the terrible man-brat Shane Patton (Jack Lacy), who even on honeymoon is obsessing that he’s been given an inferior room. That people can see themselves in all his characters is part of the show’s success. And while he doesn’t retread storylines, he often returns to the symptoms of our modern malaise – screen addiction, porn, prescription meds, identity narcissism: humans in crisis, the crisis it is to be human.Asked what else makes the show loved, White shrugs. “Honestly, I have no idea. I’ve done so many other things where I’m like, ‘This is cool’ and nobody watches. I feel like a surfer. I’ve been in the water a long time and I caught a wave. I am still riding that wave. So it’s nice.”White doesn’t shy away from the seamier side of Thai tourism. Some of this season’s action unfolds on a superyacht whose crew were thrilled to be rented by the White Lotus team, “because they were so used to Russians with prostitutes and guns”. Isaacs says, “To be honest, what I saw with the older European men and the young Thai girls is disgusting and turns your stomach. The scale of the prostitution and that people are sold into it is horrendous.” White says he noticed all the Russians as he travelled around Thailand, so wrote them in: “Hopefully they don’t feel like stock parts.”View image in fullscreenParker Posey, Sam Nivola, Sarah Catherine Hook and Jason Isaacs on set.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/HBOIsaacs says White never stops thinking about the show. Even on set he’s writing all the time. “He’ll text at odd hours, always wanting to work on it, always wanting to make it better.” White says he wants actors to feel they can approach him with their thoughts, that there are no hierarchies on set: “I don’t want to be somebody who’s niggly about every word.” He wants the characters to feel “lived in” by the actors, “natural”. But adds, “Every once in a while, I’ll think, no, I want them to say it how I wrote it. Some words are important.”All this freedom is because he doesn’t like sets that are “uptight”. “I try to make it fun as best as I can. But if you want to get something, you want to have an intentional approach. So it’s figuring out when to be mellow and when to care.”White apparently sees no contradiction in being “mellow” and also one of the most competitive people anyone has ever met. He’s training as if for a triathlon, arriving in the gym at 4.30am and where possible going to bed at 8pm. On set he has instigated a Whoop competition – as in the wristband that monitors sleep and exertion – encouraging those in the Whoop group to compare daily stats. Not just Bernad, whose Whoop registered an extreme workout, so terrified was he on the speedboat yesterday, but the young, muscle-bound actors such as Schwarzenegger.“Mike is always asking me how many grams of protein I’ve had today,” Schwarzenegger, 31, says when he pops by the tent in an I Heart LA cap. “And what’s my heart rate variability, and how many hours of sleep did I get. He’s like the only other person who, if I have a 6am call time and I go to the gym at 4.45 or 5, he’s already there.” Fedaravičius, 33, is also in the gym. In addition to practising muay thai and yoga, “I lift a lot of weights,” he says. Also, “I eat only once a day.” Usually that’s breakfast at 7am, because the hotel puts on such a good spread, but sometimes a steak or three burgers at supper. He says White’s most useful note has been “just relax”: “What Mike is asking is for us to bring in more of ourselves; uniquely ourselves. Which as an artist and an actor is a one-of-a-kind experience.”View image in fullscreenWhite Lotus newbies Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan, Leslie Bibb …View image in fullscreen… and Patravadi Mejudhon. Photographs: Fabio Lovino/HBOMost of the actors here agree that if White gives you a note, you’d be a damn fool not to take it. That’s not to say everyone does. There’s a huge clash of acting styles on set. Some are method actors, staying in character between takes and even for days between scenes. Others shake it off when the director says cut. When Isaacs, who is British, comes out of his scene with Posey, he’s asked how they differ. “She has a completely different attitude to how to be on a set and how to bring a script to life. She’s a very idiosyncratic individual. And we’re from very different schools of acting.”In Sicily, reports that Aubrey Plaza (Harper) and Michael Imperioli (Dominic) disagreed on improvisation were batted away. Plaza joked Imperioli has “intense method energy” but said they had a collaborative relationship on set. It was also suggested that in Hawaii, the onscreen friction between Bartlett and Lacy spilled on to set, something both actors denied.After season three has wrapped, I ask Bernad, back in Los Angeles, to reflect on this aspect of the show. He says, “Whether it’s subconscious or conscious, people take on the persona of their character. Like any workplace, if you spend that much time together, people start to get annoyed with one other. The heat starts to get turned up, on and off set, just naturally [because of the storylines]. That’s another aspect of the show that’s unique. On normal productions, you work, then you go home to your family. Here you work, and you go home to the same people.” Who’s in charge of HR, so to speak? “I mean me, unfortunately, yeah. It’s usually stupid things, little grievances that I have to manage.”Carrie Coon told one magazine of her six months in Thailand, “It’s something I’ll be processing for a long time.” Isaacs says, “It was a theatre camp, but to some extent an open prison camp: you couldn’t avoid one other. There are tensions and difficulties, I don’t know if they spilled from on screen to off-screen, or if it would have happened anyway. There were alliances that formed and broke, romances that formed and broke, friendships that formed and broke. It’s a long period of time for people to be away from their family with an open bar and all the wildness being in Thailand allows.“I can’t pretend I wasn’t involved in some off-screen drama. Dave has seen it before, twice, and so has Mike. I can’t speak for them, but I imagine they think it feeds into the on-screen drama, and they might well be right. I think the heat contributed to these fissures appearing. We’ll all see one other again [for the premiere] and I’m sure we’ll be hugging and kissing and remembering it fondly. But there were times when things were not quite so fond. I was in some ways used to it, but within a couple of weeks my wife [who was with him on set and used to be an actor] went, ‘Some of these people are fucking mad.’ I said, ‘No, it’s just a bunch of actors away on location, love. You’ve forgotten what it’s like.’”Still, Isaacs says he would follow Mike White off a cliff. Bernad, too. “I’ll go anywhere for Mike. I feel like everyone who works for him feels the same way.”Maybe it could be somewhere not so hot? Bernad shakes his head. “Mike doesn’t like the cold.”The White Lotus season three is on HBO from 16 February.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusTelevisionDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the mid-2010s she took some time away from music, studying to become a mental health therapist and starring in film and TV roles includingThe OAandTwin Peaks: The Return. She lives in Los Angeles with her husband, musician Zeke Hutchins, and their son. Her latest album,Sharon Van Etten & the Attachment Theory, named after her new band, is out now on Jagjaguwar; they tour the UK in March.1.MusicThe Cure at the Hollywood BowlView image in fullscreenRobert Smith and the Cure performing at the Hollywood Bowl in 2023.Photograph: Gary Coronado/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesMy band and I got to see the Cure when we were in the writing process of this new record. They were obviously a huge influence on us when we were kids and through our creative lives. Watching Robert Smith on stage, you can just tell he still loves performing so much – it’s a high bar he has set for us as artists. They did Plainsong, which was the song I walked down the aisle to, and being able to sing classic songs like Friday I’m in Love with my bandmates – there’s a magic in that kind of performance.2.FilmNightbitch(dir Marielle Heller)View image in fullscreenEmmett Snowden and Amy Adams in Nightbitch.Photograph: Searchlight Pictures/Everett/ShutterstockAs an actor, Amy Adams is so relatable and vulnerable, and really believable in every role I’ve seen her in. Here she plays a mother who, by “choice”, gives up her creative career to stay home with her child after daycare proves too expensive and unmanageable. It brings up conversations that I think couples have when they have a kid, how it changes the dynamic, even if you have a healthy relationship – sometimes you have to make hard choices. I feel lucky I’m in a relationship where my husband doesn’t want me to give up that part of myself.3.TVThe Bear, Disney+View image in fullscreen‘She commands the screen’: Jamie Lee Curtis in The Bear episode Fishes.Photograph: FXI think anyone that has been a creative has worked in the service industry, to some degree – I was more of a barista. This show really captures the family dynamic that exists in any working environment, and the stress that comes with opening a restaurant and keeping it afloat. They brought in chefs and people that have worked in the industry to make it feel sometimes stressfully relatable. Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays Jeremy Allen White’s mother, isn’t a regular character but she just commands the screen when she’s on – especially in the episode Fishes, where they have a family dinner.4.PlaceSedona, ArizonaView image in fullscreenFrank Lloyd Wright’s house near Scottsdale, Arizona.Photograph: Chon Kit Leong/AlamyMy husband and son are huge basketball fans, and we went on a family trip to the Final Four tournament in Phoenix, which we combined with a visit to Sedona. We went mountain biking, off-roading in a Jeep, and went to see Taliesin West, Frank Lloyd Wright’s winter home and studio. There’s a “Sedona vortex”, they call it: some kind of unique geological and energetic phenomenon which is believed to have an effect on physical and spiritual insight. I don’t know if I had enough time to experience that myself, but our mountain bike guide swore it changed her life.5.CafeLittle Ripper, LAView image in fullscreen‘A neighbourhood hub’: Little Ripper restaurant, Los Angeles.Photograph: https://www.littleripper.la/When I first moved to LA from New York, one of the things we talked about was that I needed a place to be able to walk to. LA is very spread out, so this was a haven for us. The couple [who run it] are from Australia, and they’re really sweet. They employ a lot of musicians, and a coffee shop naturally brings together so many people – it’s a neighbourhood hub. They bring so much to our little part of town.View image in fullscreen6.BookThe Beauty of What Remains by Steve LederA Jewish friend of mine recommended this book, written by a rabbi who goes to people’s bedsides to be with them in their last days, and he finds words of peace for them and their family. My husband’s father died this past year, and we’d been preparing for a long time, because he had dementia, but no matter how much you think you’re prepared, you’re not – it’s not like there’s a “how to grieve” process. It’s a really beautiful, uplifting book. I handed it directly to my partner after I read it, and he’s reading it now.Explore more on these topicsSharon Van EttenOn my radarTelevisionRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when I started writing at the age of 23, all I seemed to possess was an increasingly urgent impulse in my head and an unaccountable blankness where I’d assumed the conduits of inspiration would be. The inner insistence began picking words and persistence required me to follow them up, but how to expand beyond those first fragmentary bursts?Although largely ignorant of what producing fiction might require, I didn’t arrive at the page by myself. I brought Stanislavski with me. More precisely, three years’ training in his acting method at the then notorious and now defunct Drama Centre London, where I’d been taught how to make a person, from the inside out. Initially, I didn’t connect the worlds. Acting is action. Writing, words. Acting is necessarily collaborative, novels are not.Fictiontends to be made in private, while acting when all alone points to the psychiatrist’s couch rather than the silver screen. On top of that, method actors are regularly mocked for their seemingly over-the-top efforts to inhabit their characters; Robert De Niro’s 60lb weight gain to play the ageing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull or Forest Whitaker learning Swahili for playing Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland. That said, whatever scepticism surrounds the method process, the proof remains in the performance and there’s no denying it often produces emotionally intense, even revelatory experiences for the audience. Naturally enough, I wanted to take that possibility with me.Novelists who gloss over complexity for the sake of instruction make people no one else has ever knownI wanted to see the world through others’ eyes. More, I wanted to experience their experience of life. Then share it, unmediated and from their perspective rather than from the difference, or distance, of mine. As an actor, voice and body had been the vehicle for this. As a writer, language would have to do the heavy lifting instead. But repurposing that same intimate, closed-circuit perspective has become the method’s real legacy for me. Because, setting aside tales of self-indulgent actors insisting on being called their characters’ names off set or getting roughed up to better simulate a physical state, the ambition to access another’s unguarded humanity remains at the heart of it.Although Drama Centre taught me many things, the most important “how to” of this technique was introduced right at the start and drummed in until the very end. Even now I hear it being said: “Leave your instinct to judge at the door.” Which makes sense because characters, like people, are not constructed from moral positions. A character needs to be left alone to pursue their own ends. To hover above, directing attention to their flaws, is to make a mere puppet with no real life of its own. It cannot be filled with its own thoughts and repressed emotions or driven by irrational fears and self-sabotaging judgments. As with actors who delve no deeper than caricature, novelists who gloss over complexity for the sake of instruction make people no one else has ever known.Anyone who has ever had to survive their own bad choices can find examples to work from withinOf course, not judging others is unnatural to us. People who do bad things are bad people. Except if they are us, or those we love. Then we punish, forgive or justify with finer gradations of thought, feeling, memory and belief. So this must also be the catalyst for understanding those unlike us, or whose behaviour is alien to our own. It’s called “substitution” and, I think, is most readily explained in the quote from the Roman playwright Terence: “I am a human being, and I think nothing human is alien to me.” This means not only knowing who we are but who else, given a change of circumstances, might be found to be dwelling within. Rather than focus on points of difference, substitution attempts to identify similar or shared impulses, even if they spring from different roots. This intimate knowledge facilitates a richer understanding of what has led the character to become who they are and make the choices they have. Once found, it can be used as an imaginative springboard from which to extrapolate out into their entirely different actions and outcomes, while remaining embedded in truth.For example, I am neither Eily nor Stephen from my new novel The City Changes Its Face and my previous one,The Lesser Bohemians, yet the struggle against brokenness is something I understand. What it is to fail, to try, to need forgiveness, to want to be loved. It doesn’t matter if that understanding derives from other sources because once a shared truth is spliced – or substituted – into the fictional story, its logic will remain intact. Same goes for the girl from my debut,A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing, who refuses passivity even when the outcomes of her decisions prove carnivorous. Anyone who has ever had to survive their own bad choices, made on the back of unhelpful circumstances, can find examples to work from within. Or my woman fromStrange Hotelwho wants to let no one – even the reader – in, but who life happens to anyway. Identifying my own attempts at control, and subsequent helplessness at its loss, created enough imaginative energy that she could grow out in wildly differing directions from me yet remain credible in her own right. More challengingly, of course, this also applies to characters who have harmed and subjugated others, for example Stephen’s mother, or the uncle in A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing.I have never done what they did, but to write them I had to find the places of compulsion within myself. Make note of its insatiable selfishness and how easily it can run out of control. So, even in the terrible things those characters had done, there was something not alien to me.Essentially, substitution is about employing a kind of radical empathy. Without empathy, art is nothing more than a flapping mouthpiece for whichever aesthetic, ideology or political point has been placed above the duty to truth. Little wonder then that the method has become so unfashionable of late; in direct opposition to the many locked boxes of contemporary society, which claim we cannot know each other, even in imagination, the method suggests otherwise. That when we allow empathy to lead us down uncomfortable roads and accept that self-knowledge does not always set the heart aglow, we can come to recognise and know one another, deeply, through all the imperfect humanity we share.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Because the obligation to make works of honesty is one all artists are bound to fulfil. For me, using an adaptation of the method has proved invaluable. Others get there in other ways. Ultimately each artist creates their own process. But the method taught me how to see in the dark, then to recognise the components of all kinds of other people in there.The City Changes Its Faceis published by Faber on 13 February.

But the events of 5 September 1972 – the Black September terrorist attack and hostage crisis at the Munich Olympics – were not a story that the men and women covering the Games for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) expected to be telling. Nor was it, arguably, one that they were fully equipped to tackle. Tim Fehlbaum’s gripping real-life newsroom thriller deftly cuts between the nervy dramatised events behind the scenes and actual archive footage from ABC’s coverage of the tense standoff that saw two members of the Israeli team murdered and a further nine held at gunpoint in the Olympic village.This lean media procedural, which is so tautly directed that you can practically feel the panic-sweat trickling down the back of your own neck, is a stark contrast to Steven Spielberg’s rather bloated and cumbersome version of the same events and their aftermath in his 2005 pictureMunich.Brisk, jittery and predominantly filmed with hand-held cameras,September 5features a standout performance from a laconic Peter Sarsgaard as American TV veteran Roone Arledge, as well as a tightly wound John Magaro (recently seen inPast Lives) and Leonie Benesch (who excelled last year inThe Teacher’s Lounge) as unflappable and resourceful German studio assistant Marianne. Led by Magaro’s greenhorn producer Geoffrey Mason, the team of sports reporters wrestle with dinosaur-sized studio cameras, contested satellite broadcast slots, security lockdowns and the professional and ethical minefield of setting the news agenda.

It allows players to connect with other gamers around the world.The outage began in the UK at about midnight on Friday.About 71,000 gamers reported the outage to PlayStation’s website. Many users can no longer access online gaming lobbies, the PlayStation Store or their online accounts.The PSN runs a model that costs £13.49 a month, £39.99 for three months or £119.99 for 12 months for its premium subscription. Many gamers have pointed to these costs when complaining to Sony.The weekend is when certain games host special tournaments and online events. FC 25, Electronic Arts’ popular football simulator, hosts Championship matches, known colloquially as “weekend league”, on its Ultimate Team platform. Gamers spend hundreds of hours and often hundreds of pounds investing in their Ultimate Team squads.The outage also means Call of Duty fans will be unable to play during its promotional weekend and will not benefit from double XP (experience points) in Black Ops 6 and Warzone.Thousands of angry PlayStation users have expressed their frustration with the outage on social media in memes, jokes and rants.“Let’s be real; everyone deserves this month’s PS Plus for free. Paying monthly for the network to be down on a weekend is belligerent. Did someone fall asleep during their night shift? Heading into hour 5,” one X user wrote.“I work a 9 to 5 and come home just to see the PlayStation servers are down on a Friday,” another posted.“PlayStation network down, time to get to know my wife of 5 years,” joked another.Sony responded to confirm the problems with its digital service. On its support webpage, PlayStation said it was aware of the issue and that it was working to resolve it as soon as possible.The Guardian has contacted PlayStation, FC25 developer Electronic Arts, and Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard for comment.Explore more on these topicsPlayStationOnline multiplayer gamesnewsShareReuse this content"

Why not just destroy it?The clock that sits on the side of a former school has been at the centre ofa culture war in Stroud since 2021, when Guthrie asked the local council why the figure, who has large red lips and is wearing a golden leaf skirt, was still present in the town.He said: “We’re in a cost of living crisis and the cost of removing this object and putting it in a museum would come to about £30,000. Why would you spend that much money to keep a racist object alive in perpetuity – why not destroy it?”That idea is at the heart of a new piece Guthrie has created atSpike Island in Bristol. During Empty Alcove / Rotting Figure, two video pieces show an empty space after the clock and the figure have been removed, as the sound of car traffic, birdsong and children playing is heard in the background.In the other video, it is slowly destroyed. “It’s a process I’ve called ‘radical unconservation’,” adds Guthrie. “It’s like controlled demolition.”In reality the clock and the figure are still present in Stroud, despite widespread support for their removal. In summer 2021, the council launched a consultation and received more than 1,600 responses. Nearly 80% of respondents said the clock should be removed, while 22% thought it should remain in place.View image in fullscreenDan Guthrie: ‘Why would you spend that much money to keep a racist object alive in perpetuity?’Photograph: Nadine PersaudIn April 2022, district councillors agreed to pursue removal of the clock and attempt to place it in a local museum, but the situation was complicated because the clock is not owned by the council but in the possession of a trust, which restored the object in 2004.“If the trust wants to remove it, the decision has to be signed off by HistoricEngland, who in turn need to know where it is going to go. But local museums only want to accept an item with no strings attached – so it’s a huge catch-22,” said Guthrie.The town’s former Conservative MP, Siobhan Baillie, also waded into the debate and criticised local anti-racist campaigners, saying “a certain minority of people with loud voices have an unquenchable desire to be constantly finding things to be outraged at” in astatement published in the local press and on her website.After the consultation period and the council’s decision to pursue the clock’s removal, Guthrie was warned by anti-fascist groups thatthe far-right group Britain Firstwere planning to doorstep him. They didn’t turn up, but the threat showed how charged the debate had become.Stroud district council told the Guardian that it had no legal authority to remove the objects. “The conversations about the clock and the systemic issues of racial injustice and discrimination facing people from many different backgrounds in the Stroud district should continue to help ensure our local area is inclusive and welcoming to everyone,” a spokesperson added.“The council continues to explore moving the clock as well as acting on other initiatives that came out of the consultation and recommendations.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was rotting in the 1970s and in the 00s; why are we keeping it alive? Let it rot away.

Over the past five years, the German capital has seen a thriving jazz scene flourish in its clubs, spanning the soulful vocals of Douniah, the sweeping compositions of Zacharias S Falkenberg and the electronic productions of Abasé. Leading the pack is keyboardistMoses Yoofee and his groove-forward trio, who have garnered a European following thanks to their intricate and often explosive live shows, which draw on everything fromRobert Glasper-style hip-hop fusion to lightning-speed drum breaks and modal melody.On the 13 tracks of their debut album,the do not disappoint. Drummer Noah Fürbringer fires on all cylinders, driving a heavy groove on the synth-focused Push and playing in frenetic double time on Bond, while bassist Roman Klobe-Barangă provides a steady foundation, peaking on the thundering distortions of Deep, and Yoofee manages to find pockets of soulful melody throughout. The group present a remarkably confident sound, but with most tracks running at under three minutes,MYTcan feel too tightly wound and brief.

All in black, including a cowboy hat and long leather coat, the maverick rapper swaggers around looking like the negative personification of Beyoncé’s glittery country takeoverCowboy Carter, whichscooped two Grammys last week.Jpeg’s music, though, casts him as a bad guy in a post-apocalyptic genre meltdown – one in which no sound is too weird to rap to. Aphex Twin beats and a wordlessly ululating male voice? That’sReal Nega, from Jpegmafia’s breakout 2018 albumVeteran.Japanese advert samples and chiptune video game sonics? They feature prominently onGarbage Pale Kids, a brilliant cut from Jpeg’s collaborative album with fellow hip-hop left-fielder Danny Brown,Scaring the Hoes, which made many 2023 year-end lists.As genre barriers come down across the industry, guitars have become increasingly prominent in Jpegmafia’s boundary-pushing output too. More specifically, they form the backbone of his most recent solo album,I Lay Down My Lifefor You(2024), just reissued in a bumper “director’s cut” version. Here are heavy riffs, buoyed up by innard-shaking bass and sledgehammer beats. Rap-rock has a deservedly knuckle-dragging reputation, but Jpeg’s shredding bricolage has much more in common with the mischievous extremism of hyperpop producers such as Sophie than it does with Limp Bizkit.Undaunted, the crowd rearrange themselves into a series of moshpits – egged on by the man on stage, who, at 35, has come to terms with the fact that his cleverly deconstructed, polemical hip-hop draws a largely white, young male crowd. He’s leaning into it and will be supporting Linkin Park at Wembley Stadium this summer.View image in fullscreenMan in black: Jpegmafia on stage in Camden.Photograph: Sophia Evans/the Observer“This next song means ‘without fear’, Jpeg declares, introducing his 2024 trackSin Miedo. It explodes with a mixture of rapid-fire retro hip-hop samples, electric guitar hooks and lyrical grandstanding that resolves into a pumping club-music finale.Next up isDon’t Rely on Other Men, which revolves around a sample fromSuccession– Brian Cox muttering “I hear you went down” – allied to thudding kick drum, church bells, found sound and a swell of guitar arranged like a string section.Although parallels exist with fellow hip-hop-inspired noisemakers such asDeath Gripsand rapid-fire sample fiends like the lateMF Doom, Barrington DeVaughn Hendricks pretty much occupies a hip-hop sub-genre all his own. Originally from Brooklyn, via stints in Alabama and Baltimore, and now based in LA, his stage name riffs on the .jpeg image file format and his fans call him Peggy for short – just one of the many amusing contrasts thrown up by his work. Whenever he grows weary of stalking around tonight, he retires to a large lectern decorated with a Jpeg logo wreathed by palm leaves, as though the rapper were heading some international agency.In between tracks he plays the solicitous emcee, introducing songs, thanking the crowd for their support and throwing out water bottlesHendricks was honourably discharged from the US air force for reporting abuse. During his five-album solo career as Jpegmafia – more if you count the collaborations and emotional pre-Jpeg mixtapes as Devon Hendryx – it feels like this fierce artist now has all sorts of targets in his sights: other rappers, public figures, rightwingers, pearl-clutchers, phonies – and his own fans too.Veteranfeatures a song calledI Cannot Fucking Wait Until Morrissey Dies, just one early clue that Hendricks’s frame of reference goes well beyond hip-hop.“First off, fuck Elon Musk,” Jpeg raps at the start ofLean Beef Patty, aScaring the Hoestrack that goes down a storm tonight. On inauguration day last month, he released a video for his trackProtect the Crossfull of flags, explosions and anger at white people not voting for Kamala Harris. The track is present tonight. “2025, your politics is a gang sign,” he spits derisively.Although the surface impression of Hendricks is that of a noisy irritant whose tone and content are very online, his breadth of reference can be as dizzying as his fast-cut productions, from the NBA to Kenny Rogers. Accordingly, he released a pictogram-filled image of Protect the Cross’s lyrics last month that specified which lines were and weren’t Drake disses. (Other categories included “ask a black friend to interpret this” and “not about Taylor Swift”.)Watch the video for Protect the Cross by Jpegmafia.If there is one drawback to tonight’s forceful performance, it’s that all the punitive maximalism irons out Jpegmafia’s subtleties and production nuance. The emotional heft in some of his work suffers too. There is only the briefest glimpse of his thoughtful side onEither on Or Off the Drugs, a bittersweet relationship song. Peggy may be angry, but he can be disappointed, considered and even lovelorn as well.There are chuckles to be had, too, in how he rains down verse after scabrous verse, accompanied by the sort of noise that the Geneva conventions might deem in breach of human rights. But in between tracks,Jpegmafiaplays the solicitous emcee, introducing songs, thanking the crowd for their support and throwing out water bottles. Most extreme of all perhaps, this contrarian covers Carly Rae Jepsen’s Call Me Maybe, completely straight-faced.Explore more on these topicsJpegmafiaKitty Empire's artist of the weekHip-hopRaplive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

(Photo by Mahmoud Bassam/Anadolu via Getty Images)Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHistory booksReviewThe World After Gaza by Pankaj Mishra review – legacies of violenceThe shadow of colonialism looms large in this erudite yet flawed analysis of the Gaza war and Israel’s place in the worldCharlie EnglishSat 8 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTShareReading Pankaj Mishra’s The World After Gaza, I thought of no one so much as Ian Black, a former colleague who led this newspaper’s Middle East coverage for many years before taking up a fellowship at the LSE. Black was keenly aware, after decades of careful reporting from Israel-Palestine, of the tendency to adopt one cause or another and cherrypick facts to support it. In 2017, he poured his knowledge intoEnemies and Neighbours, a definitive history of the “twice promised land”, which drew praise from both sides. The source of the conflict, he wrote, came down to the diametrically opposed narratives Israeli and Palestinians told themselves. Israelis described “a quest for freedom and self-expression after centuries of antisemitic persecution”, while Palestinians thought of themselves “the country’s indigenous inhabitants who [had] lived peacefully for centuries as a Muslim majority alongside Christian and Jewish minorities”. These stories were utterly irreconcilable, since “justice and triumph for the Zionist cause meant injustice, defeat, exile and humiliation for the Palestinians”.It feels now like another era. In October 2023 Hamas launched its surprise attack, provoking an Israeli response that has killed more than 46,000 people, according to estimates, mostly women and children. As Mishra states in the introduction, he “felt almost compelled to write this book, to alleviate my demoralising perplexity before an extensive moral breakdown”. It is a seething and erudite indictment of the west’s role in the creation of Israel and everything that has flowed from it. Even prior to publication, the book has been controversial. Mishra views history through the lens of race and “decolonisation” – a word Elon Musk has tried to ban from X.Mishra is a relative latecomer to the Palestinian cause. It was Israeli heroes, not Arabs, with whom he was infatuated as a boy growing up in India: he even had a picture on his wall of Moshe Dayan, Israel’s defence minister during the Six Day War. Conversion came during a 2008 visit to Israel-Palestine, where Mishra was shocked to witness the humiliations heaped on the inhabitants of the West Bank. “Nothing prepared me for the brutality and squalor of Israel’s occupation,” he writes, “the snaking wall and numerous roadblocks … meant to torment Palestinians in their own land … the racially exclusive network of shiny asphalt roads, electricity grids and water systems linking the illegal Jewish settlements to Israel.”Crucially, he felt a strong racial bond with the Arabs. “Here,” he writes, “was a resemblance I could not deny.” They were “people who looked like me”. It is in this connection – their shared presence on the darker-skinned side of what WEB Du Bois identified as the “colour line” – that Mishra locates both his credentials and the origins of his critique. India had freed itself of western white supremacism, but the Palestianians “now endured a nightmare that I and my own ancestors had put behind us”.The evils of western colonialism, then, form the foundations of this analysis. “All Western powers worked together to uphold a global racial order,” he states, “in which it was entirely normal for Asians and Africans to be exterminated, terrorised, imprisoned and ostracised.” Nazism, in this view, was simply an extension of colonialism, which Hitler imported to mainland Europe, and the Shoah flowed naturally from other genocides committed by white people around the globe.Curiously, the Holocaust was little memorialised after the war. Citing Hannah Arendt and others, Mishra argues that it was only during the Eichmann trial in 1961 that the Shoah came to embody the political case for Zionism, with Israel as the only state that would guarantee Jewish safety. At the same time, Israeli leaders increasingly painted Arabs as Nazi collaborators who threatened a new genocide. The collective memory of the Shoah, he states, “did not merely spring organically from what transpired between 1939 and 1945, [but] was belatedly constructed, often very deliberately, and with specific political ends”. Now, as Mishra puts it, many see its memory as having been “perverted to enable mass murder” and give Israel impunity. A “widening circle” of people around the world, he writes, “level the charge that Israel is a cruel settler colonialist and Jewish-supremacist regime supported by far-right Western politicians and fellow-travelling liberals”.Supporters of Israel will doubtless level the charge of antisemitism at the idea of the Shoah being “deliberately” manipulated, although this won’t mean it isn’t partially true, or that Israel’s extremist government isn’t more politically dependent than ever on the Holocaust’s memorialisation. Many people would accept the depiction of Israel as a rampaging, supremacist regime. But there are problems with Mishra’s analysis, too. The paradigm of Israel as a settler-colonialist state fails to encompass the Jewish religious-national connection to Eretz-Yisrael, the historic Israelite homeland that is central to Zionist philosophy, or the presence in Israel of Mizrahi Jews, who have deep historical roots in the Middle East.Mapping an ideological critique on to world events, as Mishra does, requires some intellectual cartwheels to keep the theory from collapseMore widely, mapping an ideological critique on to real world events, as Mishra does, demands some intellectual cartwheels to keep the theory from collapse. To maintain the paradigm, he must airbrush all the racist colonialisms committed by nations outside the west. Japan offers a stark example. Millions of Chinese, Koreans and indigenous Taiwanese were murdered, raped, tortured and forced into sex slavery by imperial Japanese troops, but Mishra skips over these atrocities, writing instead that the island nation “humiliated European imperialisms across Asia”.The broad thesis is imbued with a reverse-colonialist rhetoric, in which millions of individuals are stereotyped and lumped together into likeminded white supremacist blocs. But the most glaring lacunae, given the subject matter, relate to Israel’s enemies, in the shape of Iran and its proxies. The first mention of Hamas in the main text comes on page 34, and then only in passing. A brief treatment of the 7 October assault appears near the book’s conclusion, where Mishra writes with some approval that “Hamas destroyed, permanently, Israel’s aura of invulnerability”. The attacks were seen as another Pearl Harbor by “shocked and horrified white majoritarians”, he concludes, in which “white power” had been “publicly violated”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Plus, the spellbinding return of Daniil Trifonov, and Figaro as farceFiona MaddocksSat 8 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 8 Feb 2025 08.54 ESTShareDetermining the success of an opera production used to be a straightforward matter: was it good, did it work. What happened on stage was paramount. Those questions remain key, not least to honour the artists taking part. When, as increasingly happens, a spokesperson comes on at the start with the verbal equivalent of a begging bowl, we cannot look away or block our ears. Nor should we. This was the case at Opera North last week, apologetically wrapped into a cast change announcement, before the company’s new production of Wagner’sThe Flying Dutchman. At this critical point in the UK’s artistic life – a new week,a new cut– that desperate line of the poet Rilke comes to mind: “Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels’ hierarchies?” For hierarchies, to interpret freely, read local authorities, funding bodies, ministers of state, the government, the prime minister. Silence.Even Opera North, exemplary in so many ways, awarded “Theatre of Sanctuary” status in 2022 “for going above and beyond to encourage understanding and compassion”, has not escaped the blade. Last autumn it announced restructuring and job losses. Performance numbers are down. No one yet knows what impact English National Opera’s partial relocation from London to Manchester will have. All these issues were constantly in mind during a musically strong, thoughtful but fragmentary production ofDutchman, conducted by Garry Walker, directed by Annabel Arden. The chorus and orchestra were magnificent throughout, as if straining every ounce of their collective energy to show what an opera company, working together, can do.The production’s central idea is to harness the limbo of asylum to the curse that condemns a Dutchman to wander the seas for eternity unless saved by that slippery entity, the love of a good woman. For reasons that felt more like unfinished business than misconception, the two stories refused to forge and left aspects of the plot less than clear. Since the whole bizarre tale is mythical, this shouldn’t matter: a ghost ship can exist in any time, any place, including dry land. Each of the three acts is prefaced by words of locally based refugees, expressing the terrors and hopes of arrival in the UK. Action is switched from high seas to ship of state, namely the Home Office, with Daland, the prosperous sea captain, now home secretary. The role was delivered with sharp detail by that seasoned actor-singer Clive Bayley, in business suit and ID tag, wading through a sea of asylum-seeker admin.Noisy piano chords hurtle down the keyboard before the soloist falls silent then enters again, as if in a change of coat, in soft, reflective moodIn her cut-off denims, black tights and waistcoat, Layla Claire looked streetwise and potent as his obsessed daughter Senta, crazed with the belief that she alone can save the Dutchman. Alas, Claire’s house debut was thwarted by illness: the Welsh soprano Mari Wyn Williams, with impressive conviction, sang from the side. Robert Hayward, an imposing and world-weary stage presence, conveyed spooky menace as the “pale man” of the title. Molly Barker made much of the cameo role of Mary. The Lithuanian tenor Edgaras Montvidas, bright-toned and lyrical, was outstanding as Erik/Steersman, his arias a reminder of the Italianate elements in the score, so formative for Wagner at this point in his career. Joanna Parker’s minimal designs included a video of a grey-green sea, the image itself static, the waves frozen in turbulence. This bleak ocean suggests the Baltic that the young Wagner encountered on a stormy voyage from Riga, an inspiration for this, his first mature masterpiece, premiered in Dresden in 1843.View image in fullscreen‘Singular virtuosity’: Daniil Trifonov performs Schumann’s Piano Concerto.Photograph: Mark Allan/PhilharmoniaWagner and Robert Schumann, wary rivals, lived briefly in that city at the same time. It was here, two years later, that Schumann’s only piano concerto was first heard, with his wife, Clara Schumann, as soloist. The Russian star pianistDaniil Trifonovperformed the concerto at the Barbican last Sunday, with theLondon Symphony Orchestraconducted by Daniel Harding. This was Trifonov’s hotly anticipated return to the UK stage after an absence not of his making (visa delays have caused cancellations). Structured more as fantasy than standard concerto, the work starts with exuberance, noisy piano chords hurtling down the keyboard before the soloist falls silent then enters again, as if in a change of coat, in soft, reflective mood: Schumann’s two personalities, fiery and introspective, cast in a few moments of music. Trifonov’s singular virtuosity, muscularity and tenderness, this last so ingrained in Schumann’s generous but vulnerable imagination, made for a spellbinding account. Prominent woodwind solos added lustre.The enlarged orchestra squeezed on stage for Mahler’s Symphony No 7, an 80-minute epic at once awkward and rumbustious, expansive and charming, now mawkish – those twingly-twangly guitar and mandolin passages, here unusually muted – now thunderous. Whip-crack pizzicatos, stratospherically high trumpet fanfares, echoing horn calls, rustic dances, sleazy waltzes, trundling cowbells like unintended noises off, a dazzling viola solo: how to make sense of a work that lurches from foreground to long shot in this quixotic, ungraspable manner. It can convince, or leave you baffled. I was somewhere in between in Harding’s intense, at times hard-driven performance, played with vigorous brilliance by the LSO.ENO’sThe Marriage of Figaro, conducted by Ainārs Rubiķis, directed by Joe Hill-Gibbins, designed by Johannes Schütz, in Jeremy Sams’s skilful translation, had one performance in March 2020 before pandemic lockdown. A revival, with a characterful cast – Mary Bevan (Susanna), Nardus Williams (Countess) and Hanna Hipp (Cherubino) leading the way – could not overcome the difficulties of playing this work as light farce. The fixed set consists of four doors, opening and shutting. Repeat. (It’s a long work. Calculate.) Still it’s worth it. Mozart’s music, tears and laughter in one note, one chord, one key change, always wins out.View image in fullscreenMary Bevan (Susanna), David Ireland (Figaro) and Cody Quattlebaum (Count Almaviva) in ENO’s The Marriage of Figaro.Photograph:  Zoe MartinStar ratings (out of five)The Flying Dutchman★★★★LSO/Harding, Daniil Trifonov★★★★The Marriage of Figaro★★★The Flying Dutchmanis at Leeds Grand Theatre until 21 February, then touring until 28 MarchThe Marriage of Figarois at the London Coliseum until 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsClassical musicThe ObserverOperaOpera NorthLondon Symphony OrchestraEnglish National Opera (ENO)live music reviewsShareReuse this content"

As freelance digital creatives, their Neukölln flat is affordable, their windowsills are plant-lined, their armchairs are Danish mahogany. Meanwhile, their social lives are curated around gallery openings for art they do not much care about, cooking and the occasional attempt at an orgy.Perfection is Berlin-based Italian writer Vincenzo Latronico’s fourth novel, his first to be translated into English, here by Sophie Hughes. The book artfully lays out detail upon detail of Anna and Tom’s quotidian existence in forensic, deadpan style, from the limited edition of Radiohead’s In Rainbows facing outwards in their LP collection to their reclaimed-wood dining table, lain with raw cotton cloth. Theirs is a life defined through a keen outward projection of taste. Over a period of about 10 years, as Berlin becomes increasingly gentrified, we observe this couple through their many possessions.Latronico’s book is modelled closely on Georges Perec’s 1965 novel, Things: A Story of the Sixties, in which another young couple, this time in Paris, lead a life in thrall to objects. Perfection follows a similar narrative structure, opening with an idealised description of an apartment before detailing the values and desires of its inhabitants, named inseparably together, their personalities subsumed within their milieu of tastes, habits and home furnishings.Anna and Tom’s early years in the city are defined by a miasma of dissatisfaction depicted as endemic to a generationYet where the “things” in Perec’s book are distinctly and evocatively material – a silver fob watch, a jade ashtray – the objects that Latronico’s protagonists desire are just as often apparitions, mediated through images posted on Instagram. It’s a crucial difference; indeed, an existential difference for a whole generation. Anna and Tom’s lives oscillate between things and images of things, material and immaterial, or at least a kind of remote materiality that manifests in undersea cables and vast warehouses of servers in the Arctic Circle. The description of a perfect boho Berlin apartment that opens the novel is actually a series of carefully curated images Anna and Tom use to attract short-term subletters, the mess of their real lives carefully hidden out of shot.But where is reality, Latronico asks in this sharp, deliciously pessimistic novel. Anna and Tom can’t seem to escape a feeling that it’s always out of reach. They hunger for authenticity at Berlin’s warehouse parties and, while home cooking, they capture these things for social media, and yet it all ends up feeling unsatisfying, only quasi-real. When reality with a capital R does arrive, it too is folded into this life-curation. At one point the 2015 migration crisis bursts into their Berlin circle. “Something was taking place that they didn’t want to miss,” we’re told, Latronico deftly layering the couple’s sincere outrage with self-serving geopolitical Fomo. All the while, the fantasy of Berlin they have helped to create is being undercut by rising prices and an influx of US tech bros.The creep of gentrification is the backdrop to Perfection, but the novel avoids nostalgia for cheap rent and bohemian community. Anna and Tom’s early years in the city are defined less by happy abandon than by a miasma of dissatisfaction depicted as endemic to a generation. Stylistically, there are pitfalls here. By keeping the reader at arm’s length from the characters’ individuality, we’re denied the distinctiveness that might sharpen our interest in their existential dissatisfaction. Depicting Anna and Tom as emblematic of a social group is clearly Latronico’s aim, as it was for Perec, but it does at points lead to a shrug for their plight. “Enthusiasm eluded them,” we’re told, “always out of reach.” Boo hoo, the reader may be forgiven for muttering. Poor privileged millennials.Yet Perfection transcends its satire of 2010s hipsterdom through the depth of Latronico’s sociological observations. This chronicle of contemporary Berlin is strongest in its articulation of how a certain kind of globalisation dislocates us from our surroundings. Anna and Tom’s actions, plainly stated, devastatingly illustrate a homogenisation shown to colonise minds and bodies as much as cities. In one standout section, Latronico describes the couple’s efforts at sexual experimentation, taking them to a club where propositions are whispered. Do they want this? They are ultimately unsure if what they feel is “desire or more a desire to desire”. This alienation from the self is at the hollow, restless heart of Anna and Tom’s lives: constantly yearning, empty of meaning. Latronico’s thought-provoking book is anything but.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

After all, just how different can a tin of beans be? To my surprise, I discovered very striking disparities between the ones I tested, so if you’re someone who routinely decants excess juice or reduces the sauce to achieve that authentic school dinner effect, you might be better off simply switching allegiance. Similarly, the sugar content varied between 9% of your recommended daily allowance to 13%, so if that’s a concern, look out for reduced- or no-sugar brands instead.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There’s a significant price difference between supermarket own labels and the leading brands, too. If you’re after a gourmet experience, I’d recommend theBold Bean Co’s rich tomato baked beans(£3.50), because they remind me of those homemade beans you sometimes get with a fry-up at fancy cafes: intensely savoury and packed full of herbs. They don’t qualify here, because they are to ordinary baked beans what rye sourdough is to white sliced, but they’re bloody lovely all the same. That said, you can’t go wrong with any of our best buys served on buttered toast with a light dusting of grated cheddar. Small pleasures don’t come much cheaper.Best all-rounderM&S baked beans in a rich tomato sauceView image in fullscreen50p for 400g at Ocado★★★★★These have a very appetising, rich colour and, like all the best baked beans, a dash of vinegar to balance out the sweetness. There’s lots of sauce (the tin holds only 49% beans), but when said sauce tastes this good, who cares? (Note that, though these are the only ones I try that aren’t thickened with modified maize starch, they do contain various extracts and flavourings. Organic varieties are a better bet if you’re trying to avoid ultra-processed ingredients.)Best bargainMorrisons baked beans in tomato sauceView image in fullscreen45p for 410g at Morrisons50p for 410g at Amazon★★★★☆Large beans in a thick, tangy sauce with a well-rounded, almost savoury flavour – this has more seasoning than most of its rivals, and you can taste it. Classic baked beans at a good price, but beware the high sugar content.Best splurgeBranston baked beans in a rich, thick, tomatoey sauceView image in fullscreen£1 for 410g at Ocado£1 for 410g at Tesco★★★★★Quite simply, the king of beans. Twice the price of the own-brands, but worth every penny, especially in comparison with its better known and more expensive rival. If you like your sauce thick, deliciously savoury and generously seasoned with salt and sugar, give these a try – once you taste them, you’ll never go back.And the rest …Heinz BeanzView image in fullscreen£1.40 for 415g at Ocado£5.25 for six 415g cans at Amazon★★★★☆It can’t be denied that the brand synonymous with baked beans knows how to woo the eye with plump, perfectly cooked beans in a sauce that’s thin enough to show them off in all their creamy beauty. That sauce, however, doesn’t live up to the premium price tag – it’s thin and sweet. I think Heinz is riding off its reputation at this point.Bramwells baked beans in a rich tomato sauceView image in fullscreen41p for 410g at Aldi★★★☆☆Winner of ablind tasting last year by consumer group Which?, these have a thick, almost gloopy sauce but a nice colour and a decent, if unexciting flavour, which is perhaps what people want from their morning beans.

I can’t taste the onion powder or paprika, though from the colour of them, there’s a lot of the latter. If you have a sweet tooth, these are the beans for you.Waitrose Essential baked beans in tomato sauceView image in fullscreen55p for 420g at Waitrose★★★☆☆The most highly seasoned tin I try, but the watery orange sauce is definitely second fiddle to the real stars: the nicely cooked beans. That said, I pick up a weirdly meaty aftertaste that puts me off a bit, but I’ll be honest, with some grated cheese, I probably wouldn’t notice.Sainsbury’s baked beans in tasty tomato sauceView image in fullscreen40p for 400g at Sainsbury’s★★☆☆☆Copious amounts of sauce with a fairly one-dimensionally sweet flavour, despite the fairly average sugar content. Nothing offensive here, just a wee bit underwhelming.Tesco baked beans in tomato sauceView image in fullscreen43p for 420g at Tesco★☆☆☆☆Unusually soft, mushy beans in a sauce that, given the relatively high sugar and salt content, is oddly bland, and thickened with maltodextrin as well as the usual modified maize starch. Just dull.Ocado baked beans in tomato sauceView image in fullscreen43p for 420g at Ocado★☆☆☆☆There are lots of small, broken beans in here, suggesting they’ve been overcooked, and they come floating disconsolately in a pallid, thin sauce. Really disappointing. (On the plus side, these have the lowest sugar content of all the beans I try, so if you’re looking for haricot beans on a budget, just give these a rinse: they’re a lot cheaper than the plain kind.)Explore more on these topicsBeans, pulses and legumesThe FilterVegetablesBritish food and drinkFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Transfer the beetroot stock to a large pan and add the hot vegetable stock.Melt 50g of the butter in a casserole dish on a medium heat and, when it’s melted and hot, add the shallots, garlic, ginger and a teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring frequently, for eight to 10 minutes, until the mix starts to turn golden.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Add the rice, stir-fry for a couple of minutes, then pour in the marsala and let it sizzle away.

Open the chilled tin of coconut milk, spoon out the solid cream from the top and stir this into the rice (save the coconut liquid for a smoothie). Take the pan off the heat and cover to keep warm.Meanwhile, dice the remaining beetroot into 1cm cubes. In a frying pan, melt the remaining 25g butter on a medium heat, then add the mustard and cumin seeds, the curry leaves and the chopped chilli, and leave to splutter for 30 seconds. Add the diced beetroot and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, stir-fry for six to eight minutes, then take off the heat and stir in the lime juice and zest.Check the risotto for seasoning, and stir in a little more water to loosen, if need be.

She also noted that only 22% of us know how to test if an egg is fresh and safe to eat.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

To test a raw egg’s freshness, put it in a bowl of water: if it sinks and lies flat, it’s fresh; if it stands upright, it’s safe but needs eating soon; and if it floats, it’s past its best, so feed it to the compost monster.If you have a surfeit of eggs, you can boil them to prolong their life for a further four or five days in the fridge, but to preserve them for even longer, I like to make pickled eggs using a few spices to give them lots of flavour.Pickled eggsI grew up in a small village in Dorset where there wasn’t a whole lot to do: when we weren’t cycling around and rambling through the forest, my best friend, Luke, and I would frequentThorncombe sports club, where we’d play endless games of darts and pool. As minors, our main refreshment was a pint of Coke with a bag of salt-and-vinegar crisps and a pickled egg.Pickling is one of the simplest forms of preservation, and pickled eggs are a true British classic. Like most pickle recipes, they taste much nicer when you make them yourself. Free-range or organic eggs, half-decent vinegar and an interesting combination of herbs and spices will take your pickled eggs to a whole other level.I tested a few different flavour combinations beyond a classic pickled egg, using up some spices from my kitchen cupboards. One batch I made with beetroot cooking liquid instead of water, which I’d saved from a boiling some beetroots that morning, and then infused it with cumin and fresh dill; I also made a batch with turmeric, peppercorn and ginger, and another spicier batch with lots of chilli flakes and a lime, which was my favourite of the three, though the beetroot and turmeric eggs were both very pretty.6 eggs2 heaped tsp sugar1 level tsp sea salt150ml vinegar– apple cider, malt or wine vinegar150ml water, or beetroot cooking liquidOptional aromatics1 garlic clove, peeled1 dried chilli, or 1 heaped tsp chilli flakes2 tsp mixed spices, such as mustard seeds, peppercorns, star anise, cardamom, curry powder, cumin, coriander seeds, turmeric)2 sprigs fresh herbs, such as bay leaf, thyme, oregano, coriander, or 1 tsp dried herbsOther optional ingredientsSliced gingerLime or lemon wedgesBeetroot stalksPut six eggs in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil.

Add the vinegar, then gently drop in the six peeled hard-boiled eggs and your chosen optional aromatics (use whatever you have). Seal the jar, making sure the eggs are submerged, then refrigerate for up to a month. They’re ready to eat immediately, but, to guarantee the best flavour, leave them to pickle for at least a few days.Explore more on these topicsEggsWaste notFoodFood wastePickling, fermenting and preservingSnacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"
