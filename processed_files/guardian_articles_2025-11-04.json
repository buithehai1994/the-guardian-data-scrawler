Outside election campaigns, press conferences usually signal major set piece events or a national emergency. Now you can’t move for them. Reform have had four inside a week with another one lined up for tomorrow. EvenKemi Badenochhas been at it with a bizarre outdoors show-and-tell last Thursday. Blink and you would have missed it.Tuesday wasRachel Reeves’s turn. Her Lance Corporal Jones “Don’t Panic! Don’t Panic!” moment. Normally a chancellor takes a vow of silence in the weeks leading up to the budget. Locked away in the Treasury, head down over economic forecasts, anxious to give nothing away.But not this year. Now Rachel wanted to give as many clues away as possible. Call it the budget performed in interpretative dance. Nothing actually spelled out but the message was clear. Not least in the timing. A press conference that takes place at 8.10am in Downing Street and is broadcast on nearly every terrestrial channel screams: “Help! Things have gone seriously tits up!” Anyone watching would have been well advised to run for cover. You could see the bad news coming a mile away.This was Reeves trying to catch a break. Hoping to get in the bad headlines early so that, come 26 November, she will get an easier ride. Let people imagine the worst and be pleasantly surprised when it turns out not to be so terrible as expected. We are rapidly approaching the point where words no longer have meaning.A speech that was delivered as code. Twenty minutes of white noise in which the thing she was trying to tell us was never actually mentioned. How to tell your audience you are going to raise income tax without actually telling them you are planning to raise income tax. Something she and Keir Starmer have been practising relentlessly for the last couple of months. There can’t be many people left who aren’t preparing to be worse off. So you could call it job done.“I want to be honest with the country,” Reeves said. Really? It didn’t feel that way. For a start, there was the inability to say the one thing that was on her mind. Around which everything else was just padding and self-justification. Then there were the more philosophical questions. If she was being honest now, how come she hadn’t been able to be honest with us previously? Was themanifesto pledge not to raise income tax, VAT and national insurancenever meant to be taken seriously? Just some bullshit to win an election. And why repeat the promise to the CBI when she must have known she was unlikely to be able to keep it?Next we were into Schrödinger’s economy. At last year’s budget, Reeves had fixed the foundations of the economy and yet somehow failed to fix the foundations of the economy. Everything was both tickety-boo – we were the fastest growing economy in the G7, borrowing costs were going down etc – and yet she somehow now had another hole in the public finances to fill that she hadn’t anticipated. Nor should we be too bothered by the forecasts of the Office forBudgetResponsibility because their forecasts were not forecasts. They were forecasts that looked backwards. We’ll have to take her word for that.Anyone would be facing these choices that could not be named, Rachel continued. And she was proud of what she had done. There would be no return to the austerity of the Tories. Reform had no solutions either. We all just had to bite the bullet and suck it up. She just hadn’t anticipated quite how much damage Brexit and the Liz Truss budget had done to the economy. Basically, she was just being courteous and doing us all a favour. We should be happy to pay a bit more to protect our public services. Look at it this way, this was far more painful for her than it was for us. We are all so broke we won’t notice becoming even more broke.“A brighter future is within our grasp,” Reeves concluded. At which point you could feel everyone’s heart sink. Politicians have been saying that repeatedly over the past 15 years and every time things have only got worse. It’s the reverse Midas touch.Understandably most of the questions cut straight to the chase. Why couldn’t she just admit she was planning on raising taxes and why did she find it so hard to keep her promises? Rachel stonewalled. She had said all she had come to say. Now she just wanted to get the hell out of the room. It had been an excruciating 40 minutes for her. Still, at least almost no one was talking about her embarrassing rental faux pas. Bank the small wins while you can.1:48Rachel Reeves avoids answering question on tax rises in pre-budget speech – videoReeves wasn’t the only one having a press conference. Kemi Badenoch was also up and about in front of the cameras. Only whereas the chancellor’s had some tangental purpose, Kemi’s had none whatsoever. Though the Tory leader has clearly got the taste for them. Her very own echo chamber where she can stand up in front of a small gathering of her shadow ministers and say things that are totally irrelevant to the rest of us straight to camera. Gone and quickly forgotten.With four union jacks behind her, Kemi proceeded to deliver the director’s cut of the speech she had given last week. No one had listened then and no one was paying much attention now. Just an exercise in existential self-indulgence. This time she droned on for twice as long. Sending twice as many people to sleep.Tory patience wears thin as Badenoch’s critics count down to May electionsRead moreHer theme was the familiar one. Like Nigel Farage, she is a broken record. The country is broken and only she could save it. Primarily by cutting benefits and a return to austerity. She hasn’t yet realised that as much as people have doubts about Reeves’s ability to turn the country around, the last thing anyone wants is a lecture from the Tories. After all, it was theConservativeswho brought the country to its knees and there is no enthusiasm for their return. The kindest thing they could do is give us all a break and self-destruct in private.A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.On Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back with special guests at another extraordinary year, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025The politics sketchRachel ReevesKemi BadenochLabourReform UKConservativesNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, it was a subpoena. He had been sued in federal court for illegally downloading 80 movies. Some of the titles sounded cryptic – Do Not Worry, We Are Only Friends – or banal, like International Relations Part 2. Others were less subtle: He Loved My Big Ass, He Loved My Big Butt, and My Big Booty Loves Anal.Brown, who had spent decades investigating sex crimes, claimed he had never watched any of them. His years “dealing with pimping”, he wrote in a court filing, left him “with no interest in pornography”. He had been married for 40 years, he did not need to download Hot Wife, another title in the list. But the subpoena did not seem like something he could laugh off. It said he could face damages of up to $150,000 per movie – as much as $12m for all 80 films. If he did not respond promptly, the letter said, Comcast would identify him to the plaintiff in the case: a company called Strike 3 Holdings.‘I didn’t start out wanting to see kids’: are porn algorithms feeding a generation of paedophiles – or creating one?Read moreStrike 3 is not a name that Brown, or most people outside the world of copyright law, would recognize. The Delaware-based corporation, formed in 2015, owns the intellectual property rights to a catalog of about 2,000 adult films, mostly made by Vixen Media Group, its porn production subsidiary. It had very little online footprint; no social presence to speak of. But its associates were better known. The company was co-founded by Greg Lansky, the French porn director whose recent pivot to the art world has yielded works such as Algorithmic Beauty,amarble reproductionof the Venus de Milo with breast implants taking a selfie.Lansky, a 42-year-old Parisian, was something of a celebrity in the adult industry, having formed Vixen, the production company behind some of the porn world’s most popular brands: Vixen, Slayed, Wifey, Milf-y, Tushy, Tushy Raw, Blacked, Blacked Raw. The studio’s commitment to high-production value had attracted dozens of awards in adult media and write-ups from outlets outside it.

His free videos regularly ranked among the most-viewed scenes on PornHub, pushing viewers towards a paid tier. And his websites, Lansky has said, follow the “same business model as HBO”: premium subscription services, charging between $9.95 and $29.95 a month.What Lansky left out was that, since September 2017, Vixen’s owners had been pursuing another revenue stream: filing thousands of boilerplate copyright lawsuits against individual “John Does” and collecting millions in settlement fees – a mass litigation campaign one federal judge likened to “a hi-tech shakedown”.Brown, who was sued in November of 2017,numbered among Strike 3’s earliest targets. But in the eight years since, Strike 3 has become the most prolific copyright plaintiff in the country – filing, bythe Guardian’s analysis of Pacer data, more than 20,000 federal copyright cases since September 2017.[Strike 3] treats this Court not as a citadel of justice, but as an ATMJudge Royce C LamberthMore recently, Strike 3 has been in the news for a higher profile case: a $350m copyright lawsuit against Facebook’s parent company Meta. Meta is a rare corporate defendant; the overwhelming majority of Strike 3’s suits are aimed at anonymous users across the country. Lansky, who sold his stake in Vixen Media in 2020, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, nor did a representative for Vixen Media Group. A spokesperson for Strike 3 declined to answer specific questions about its legal strategy, but provided a statement to the Guardian: “Strike 3 is a legitimate film studio, that has created award-winning content, distributed through paid subscription platforms,” she wrote, “and has resorted to litigation only when necessary to protect the livelihood [sic] and its paying subscribers from widespread piracy.”Some judges are furious at just how many cases Strike 3 are filing. Armed with “hundreds of cut-and-pasted complaints and boilerplate discovery motions, Strike 3 floods this courthouse (and others around the country) with lawsuits smacking of extortion”, district judge Royce C Lamberth wrote. “It treats this Court not as a citadel of justice, but as an ATM.”The sheer number of lawsuits has spawned a cottage industry of defense attorneys looking to take on the John Does’ cases. “I see new ones popping up all the time,” said attorney Steve Vondran, who is something of an influencer in this community, having defended more than 500 Strike 3 cases. He answers questions on YouTube and LinkedIn like: “Am I going to lose my house?” or “Will I have to file for bankruptcy?”Thousands of lawsuits follow a similar formula: Strike 3 claims to use a proprietary software called VXN Scan to track IP addresses that have downloaded porn they own. The software cannot identify the user beyond a rough geographic location, so Strike 3 files suit against an anonymous John Doe, and subpoenas their internet service provider (ISP) to unmask the user. The ISP in turn alerts the subscriber – which is when most people find out they have been sued.These people are often keen to settle, being cheaper than litigation and the only way to ensure their anonymity.That was certainly the case for Ken Jones*, a 28-year-old mental health worker, who received his own subpoena earlier this year. (Jones was the only defendant out of the dozen the Guardian contacted who was willing to discuss his case on the record, and he agreed to do so only on the condition of anonymity and without specifics to his settlement agreement.) “I remember being terrified. I had no idea what to do,” he said. “My mind kept going to the worst case scenario: life savings gone because of a few downloads. It felt unreal. I was unable to eat or sleep for some time.”Though he maintained to the Guardian he had never seen any of their films, Jones decided to settle because “it was the quickest way to leave this in the past”, he said.The “shame and taboo” made “the decision to fight the allegations a bit more challenging”.As Strike 3 tells it, these lawsuits are merely a defense against piracy. Its films, the company claims, “are among the most pirated content in the world” (though they did not provide data to support that claim).Critics see Strike 3 differently –the country’s leading “copyright troll”, or a rightsholder who treats litigation as a business model, rather than a means of protecting their work. Strike 3 does not disclose how much it makes from lawsuits, but several defense attorneys who spoke to the Guardian estimated that the company makes millions each year. Though copyright law allows for statutory damages of up to $150,000 per film, in reality, most defendants pay about $750 per title, according to Vondran. But for several dozen titles, that can quickly become settlements that range between $20,000 and $30,000.“They want usually, minimum, what I call ‘five-figure settlements’: $10,000 or more,” Vondran said. “It’s why I think they wait to get at least 24 movies before they sue you, because that takes them right into that zone.” Even if only half of their cases settle in a given year, Strike 3 could collect between $20m and $30m in fees.The rise of the‘copyright trolls’Copyright trolls, a category which many have argued includes Strike 3, have skirted much notice outside legal circles, in part because they are seen as a relic of a bygone era.The copyright troll emerged from the 2000s internet, when the proliferation of peer-to-peer sharing tools first gave the public unprecedented access to almost any copyrighted work – be it My Little Pony Crystal Princess: The Runaway Rainbow(2006) orbootleg footage of the heavy metal Fuck Christ Tour ‘93.Between 2003 and 2008, the Recording Industry Association of America responded by filing more than 35,000 lawsuits against music pirates. Their campaign focused more on deterrence rather than revenue, but they created a model others soon copied. By the new decade, the courts were inundated by a new kind of mass copyright litigation – what law professor and part-time trolling historian Matthew Sag called, the “BitTorrent era”, after the sharing protocol popularized by sites like the Pirate Bay.View image in fullscreenThe homepage of the Pirate Bay, the popular filesharing website.Photograph: FocusDigital/AlamyThese suits were perfectly legal; any copyright owner is entitled to sue for infringement. But between 2011 and 2014, several entities emerged as what Aaron Moss,author of the Copyright Lately newsletter, calls “frequent flyers”– plaintiffs who seemed more interested in a “sue and settle” approach, rather than earnestly deterring pirates. Theserepeat litigants tended to come from struggling industries such as newspaper and independent movies (Voltage Pictures, the production company behind The Hurt Locker and later, Dallas Buyers Club,is notoriously aggressive for pursuing lawsuits against individual John Does).But the vast majority came from porn companies – so many that the subset earned its own name: “porno-trolling”.[Most] reluctantly pay rather than have their names associated with illegally downloading porn ... For these individuals, resistance is futileJudge Otis WrightPorno-trolls had “discovered the nexus of antiquated copyright laws, paralyzing social stigma, and unaffordable defense costs”, Judge Otis Wright wrote in the opinion that coined the term. “They exploit this anomaly by accusing individuals of illegally downloading a single pornographic video. Then they offer to settle – for a sum calculated to be just below the cost of a bare-bones defense.” Most “reluctantly pay rather than have their names associated with illegally downloading porn”, he went on. “For these individuals, resistance is futile.”Porn was itself a struggling industry; the proliferation of free streaming sites cut into producers’ profits. But the early porno-trolls seemed to stretch the bounds of what copyright law allowed. The bulk of these cases were represented by a firm called Prenda Law, many of whose clients, it turned out, did not exist.The firm, prosecutors later alleged, had ahabitof creating “sham” porn companies with fake executives and suing on their behalf. (One of the “officers” of their supposed clients was in fact, per theLos Angeles Times, “the unpaid caretaker of Steele’s cabin in rural Minnesota” who had been promoted to fake porn executive without his knowledge.) By 2016, partners at Prenda Law, John Steele and Paul Hansmeier, were arrested by federal authorities and charged on 18 counts of fraud, perjury, and money laundering. At times, the complaintalleged, Steele and Hansmeier went so far as to film low-budget porn themselves and upload it to torrent sites “in order to lure people to download the movies”. Steele was eventually sentenced tofiveyears in federal prison; Hansmeier to14.Not every porno-troll went to such overtly illegal lengths. If Prenda Law invented the model, Malibu Media professionalized it. The most prolific of the porn plaintiffs, Malibu Media was the legal arm of softcore website X-Art, run by the pornographer couple Colette Pelissier and Brigham Field. The couple’s prolific caseload attracted national press and aprofilein the New Yorker.(The headline read: The Biggest Filer of Copyright Lawsuits? This Erotica Website.) In 2014, the couple had filed a third of all US copyright litigation that year: 1,300 infringement cases.By the end of the Obama administration, however, it seemed that copyright trolling had peaked. BitTorrenting was on the wane, as streaming platforms took over popular entertainment. Many of the biggest players seemed to burn out: the Prenda partners went to jail, and Malibu imploded into infighting. (In late 2016, Malibu’s founders sued their own lawyer, Florida attorney Keith Lipscomb, for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty; the case was later dismissed). The era of copyright trolling appeared to be winding down. “Filesharing lawsuit numbers drop by more than half,” Ars Technicareportedthat year. Sag, the field’s most-cited scholar, moved on to other research. “My gut says that it has decreased in volume somewhat,” one IP attorney told me, “but that’s just my gut feeling.”But in reality, the field was merely changing shape. In 2017, a lawyer from the Lipscomb firm, which had led Malibu Media’s copyright campaign, found a new job as general counsel at Vixen Media Group. Strike 3 filed its first copyright claim three months later. These days, bulk copyright cases still account for the majority of federal copyright filings; the field of participants has merely become more concentrated. According to Westlaw and Pacer data from the past three years, Strike 3 accounted for 50% of the federal copyright docketall on its own.I first heard about Strike 3 in September, when some legal clerk friends mentioned that nearly every judge on their circuit was handling a stack of Strike 3 cases – which are now so consistent as to have become routine. One would be hard pressed to find a federal judge in America who has not encountered the porn company; in a 2022 article about intellectual property experience in the western district of Texas, for example, half of the justices explicitly cited Strike 3:Chief judge Orlando Garcia: “The chief judge’s docket features a hefty amount of trademark and copyright work, particularly from a litigious porn studio, Strike 3 Holdings.”Judge Fred Biery: “Judge Biery’s docket, like the chiefs, is full of copyright suits filed by Strike 3.:Judge Robert Pitman: “His docket is likewise filled with cases from Strike 3.”Judge Jason Pulliam: “Judge Pulliam … like several of his colleagues, has Strike 3 filing up a big portion of his intellectual property work.”Judge Xavier Rodriguez: “And like some of his peers, he has faced a series of copyright suits from Strike 3.”The vast majority of Strike 3’s cases are settled or voluntarily dismissed for undisclosed reasons. None of the lawyers I spoke to could name a single claim that had gone to trial, and according to Westlaw’s litigation analytics, no case ever has.Only 10 or so people have even tried – one of them was Brown, the retired cop. Shortly after receiving his subpoena, he countersued the company for negligent emotional distress. He hired the intellectual property lawyer J Curtis Edmondson, a recurring figure on the Strike 3 circuit. Of the maybe 10 cases that “have gone the distance”, as he puts it, to litigate Strike 3’s allegations, Edmondson has represented all but one.Edmondson’s interest in litigating Strike 3 cases stems from the fact that, despite the company’s broad success in bringing copyright infringement claims, there remain several open questions about its methods. For one, IP addresses are notoriously fickle; it is easy to spoof an IP address through a virtual private network (VPN) or to use someone else’s address via malware that bypasses passwords. More to the point, as Mitch Stoltz, IP litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, puts it: “In a lot of cases, many, many people are using the same IP address.” Any given address may be shared between roommates, colleagues or members of a family.The prevalence of shared IP addresses has yielded some high-profile misfires; in 2011, for example, a porn company called Hard Productions sued a grandma in her 70s for torrenting hours of hardcore. (The retired widow “doesn’t know what BitTorrent is”, SF Gatereported at the time, though she did live next to “a handful of young men”.) A few years later, the production company behind the 2014 Adam Sandler film The Cobbler sued an Oregon man for allegedly downloading the film multiple times. The defendant, it turned out, ran an adult foster care, and his internet was regularly accessed by his residents. The case, Cobbler Nevada v Gonzales, went up to the ninth circuit, which ruled that IP addresses alone were insufficient for identifying infringement. In order to state a claim, the justices wrote, the plaintiff had to allege “something more” – some additional evidence to establish “a reasonable inference that a subscriber is also an infringer”.Brown found himself in a similar situation. As it turned out, the retired cop had an adult son who lived at home, who had not held a job in 10 years and lived with a social anxiety so absolute it prevented him from “talking to strangers” or driving, during which he would “constantly worry about how other people on the road can run into me”. As a result, the son later wrote in a legal filing: “I rarely leave my house and spend most of the time in my own room.” As the case progressed, Strike 3 found their “something more” – namely, the son’s profile on a uTorrent forum, where he wrote things such as “utorrent is a keeper.” But in this case, that was neither here nor there; they had sued Brown, not his son. Strike 3 quickly dropped the claims, and in 2020, a judge sided with Brown on his countersuit, affirming that he had not infringed any copyright and awarding him $47,777.26 in attorney’s fees. It remains the biggest victory any John Doe has notched against Strike 3, and yet for many critics, somewhat bittersweet.The black box suing softwareFor Edmondson, the real question at the heart of Strike 3’s cases, and others like it, concerns the detection software used to identify those downloading Vixen’s porn videos. As part of a case, Strike 3 and its peers submit records that a given IP address is linked to specific downloads. But the software that produces those records is shrouded in mystery. “The corporate entities, people, software, and processes relied upon to prove infringement,” Sag wrote, “are somewhat shadowy and opaque.”And there are many reasons, Edmonson argues, to doubt their accuracy. When geolocation services cannot match an IP address with a specific location, as Vondran has noted, they may “randomly assign addresses to a general location”. In one prominent example from 2017, for example, Venice PI, the company that owns the copyrights to the Bruce Willis film Once Upon A Time in Venice, filed two suits against the same defendant: a 91-year-old man named Wilbur Miller who was not only deceased but had, as his widow attested, “suffered from dementia” for at least five years, rendering him “both mentally and physically incapable of operating a computer”.For a time, nearly every John Doe copyright case in the US claimed to use a suite of detection services based in Germany. These companies went by many names – Guardaley, IPP International, Maverickeye UG, Excipio Gmbh or Crystal Bay Corp – but they employed many of the same staff, filed many near-identical declarations in court cases, and seemed on the whole to be, per Sag, “essentially the same entity”. At the very least, they seemed to all be controlled by the same few people, though who those people were exactly was somewhat unclear. Crystal Bay Corp, for example, filed more than 500 declarations signed by an expert witness identified as “Darren M Griffin” – a man who, as Edmondson laterwrote, “is in fact a completely fictitious person”. (Griffin did, however, have two flesh-and-blood colleagues at Crystal Bay, who variously attested to work at Guardalay, IPP and Maverickeye.)We were all waiting to see ... What was their technology going to show?Steve Vondran, attorneyStrike 3 relied on these same services until 2018,when they debuted their own tracking software, VXN Scan. In legal filings, Strike 3 claims it functions much like a BitTorrent client – downloading pieces of a given work from peers within the torrent network, and tracing those pieces back to the IP addresses seeding them. But Edmondson and others argue that the new detection tool, like its German predecessors, is a “black box”. As Edmondson put it: “Nobody knows how it works.”Because none of Strike 3’s cases have ever gone to trial, the company has never had to disclose the source code, or submit the software to closer scrutiny. In 2023, the Strike 3 legal community watched as one Florida defendant, a defense contractor and another Edmonson client, got closer than anyone ever had. After three years of litigation, a jury trial had been scheduled that spring. “We were all waiting to see – what was going to be the outcome?” Vondran recalled. “What was their technology going to show?” They never found out; on the eve of trial, the parties reached a confidential settlement.Strike 3’s critics may now get another chance. The company’s lawsuit against Meta, first filed in July, takes its copyright litigation to new heights, and a much larger target.The case emerged amid a flood of copyright lawsuits against the AI firms that now dominate the US economy. Meta and its peers have argued their use of copyrighted material is “transformative”, meaning it changes the original work enough to amount to fair use. But in a lawsuit filed by a group of authors, Meta emails revealed the company had torrented as much as 81.7 terabytes of pirated books and academic papers from such sites as Anna’s Archive. (A district judge later ruled against the authors on procedural grounds, without determining if Meta’s use of copyrighted work was lawful).The case prompted Strike 3 to examine its archive of recorded infringement, where it claims to have identified 47 different IP addresses owned by Meta. Strike 3 alleges that, over the course of years, Meta torrented at least 2,396 of its films for training artificial intelligence – infringements which could, if proven, amount to $350m in damages.‘Would love to see her faked’: the dark world of sexual deepfakes – and the women fighting backRead moreThe tech company is fighting the case – filing a motion to dismiss last week that argued Strike 3 had failed to show that Meta “was aware of the downloads” or “directed this activity”. The motion instead pointed the finger at Strike 3’s more common target: “unidentified users” who downloaded porn for “private personal use”. In a statement to the Guardian, Strike 3’s spokesperson contested that characterization: “This case is not about isolated personal activity,” she wrote. “This complaint reflects coordinated, corporate-scale conduct and the unauthorized distribution of creative works across multiple networks and jurisdictions.”)For Strike 3 defense lawyers, the larger case presents a new opportunity to scrutinize the porn firm’s piracy detection practices because, according to the complaint, the company tracked Meta’s downloads the same way they had the Does’: VXN Scan. If the case proceeds to trial, it may finally let the public look inside Strike 3’s black box.Strike 3’s spokesperson indicated they are keen to fight the case. “If the Meta case represents anything, it is Strike 3’s belief in its company and confidence in its technology,” she wrote. “Meta will undoubtedly bring the most powerful legal team to bear, but that does not change the facts or the law.”For Edmondson, the concern is the precedent it sets in a world where digital records are easy to falsify. “I kind of look 10 years into the future when it will be ridiculously easy to fabricate information,” he said. As he sees it, the courts should “take a stand now, at the beginning of a case, as to whether the evidence is good evidence or not”, because in the future, “you could just create that all using AI.”*Using a pseudonym"

You wonder where Mo Salah left his shooting boots, or why Virgil van Dijk seems to have forgotten the whole concept of tackling. But this isn’t on the players, it’s on you – or so you’ll tell the press – as you stare at the tactics screen trying to figure out which of the dozens of potential tweaks will change the tide of this depressing spectacle.Football Manager was always the data-driven alternative to the visually opulent Fifa series (now EA Sports FC), but the latest instalment starts to bridge the graphical gap. The 3D-rendered match highlights have been given an upgrade via the new Unity engine, and the results are impressive. Premier League derbies, Champions League finals, and even away matches in the north-east have visual gravitas now, even if the replays and so-called important moments often overstay their welcome. There are no Fifa-style authentic chants ringing around the stadia, but the atmosphere is palpable and your imagination fills in the blanks.View image in fullscreenA tangible impact on tactics … Football Manager 26.Photograph: SegaThis new engine and the elevated matchday experience are the biggest signs of Football Manager’s vision of the future. However, the visual upgrade is about more than spectacle – there is a tangible impact on tactics. While watching a game, you can study your players’ movement on the pitch, making changes accordingly. But when you desperately need to turn things around in front of 45,000 raucous Mackems, data-driven metrics are still king. You might want to switch your build-up strategy to play through the press, or overload one flank with overlapping runs. There are myriad possibilities and you will experiment with them all.The biggest change is the separation of tactical strategies for when you have possession of the ball and when you don’t. It’s the most significant overhaul in a decade, properly representing the intricacies of the modern game. Now you can completely change formation, swap player positions, and give granular instructions that shift depending on which team has the ball. Want your fullback inverting when you reach the final third? It’s not only possible, but they’ll dutifully head back to their rightful position when Alexander Isak is bundled to the floor on the edge of the box.But thereareissues. After a fallow year to manage the transition to the new engine, Football Manager 26 remains remarkably unpolished. It has already received numerous hotfixes to tackle the worst bugs, but many remain, from overlapping UI and subs running on to the pitch in their tracksuits, to menu errors that prevent progress completely.Between matches, the new UI will take some getting used to, especially as some important screens are multiple clicks away when they used to be more accessible. You have all the same information at your disposal (even more, with the addition of women’s leagues), it’s just found in slightly different places. Relearning a lifetime of muscle memory is frustrating and more customisation would be preferable, but it’s a minor gripe that time will soothe.And despite these issues, this is still Football Manager, with all of its delicious tactical minutiae to get lost in. Thanks to the modernised tactics and match engine, making the perfect tactical tweaks to kickstart a stoppage time comeback and silence those oh-so-confident home fans has never felt better. Football Manager 26 provides tangible feedback to your split-second decisions and lets you conceive fictional rivalries that can last for seasons. And when you beat Sunderland with three goals in the final five minutes, the thrill remains unsurpassed.Football Manager 26 is out now, £49.99Explore more on these topicsGamesSports gamesPCPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XNintendo Switch 2Simulation gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

A survey by Sky Mobile has revealed that getting a LOL in a message gives 26% of 18- to 28-year-olds the ick. Their second biggest gripe, in fact.What’s topof the icks?Sluggish replies. Related, and not far behind, is an impatient “??” if you don’t get an immediate reply to the first message.

And I am probably not replying to that, that’s what I’m doing.Rly?Really.

Going back to that Sky Mobile survey, 58% of these gen Zs confessed they have considered dumping their partner because of what they see as bad phone etiquette.

Or perhaps I was more likely to smile atthem, while feeling content and dry-headed under the canopy.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.We Britons have loved brollies – previously an aristocratic luxury – since about the turn of the 19th century. Today, they’re a broad tent covering tight budgets and expensive tastes alike. You’ll see them sprout like mushrooms whenever rain hits the high street.Most decent umbrellas will succeed in keeping you dry(-ish), but there are differences to be found when you peer under the canopy. Some have a stronger and smoother mechanism of ribs, stretchers, runner and frame; others are lighter and nicer to hold; and certain models reveal exceptional craft in details such as a smooth wooden handle or a shiny tip.Of course, many of us care about the appearance of our umbrellas, too. Excellent finishing is an aesthetic consideration, as well as a clue as to the brolly’s longevity.At a glanceBest umbrella overall:London Undercover Classic£115 at London UndercoverBest budget umbrella:Doppler Zero 99£29.99 at AmazonBest folding umbrella:Blunt Metro Umbrella£74.70 at AmazonBest-looking umbrella:Oswin Hyde Joseph£49 at DebenhamsBest mini umbrella:Davek Mini£60 at DavekBest golf umbrella:Fulton Titan 1£29.87 at AmazonWhy you should trust meAs a regular umbrella carrier, I use these contraptions to stay dry on my soggy travels around the north of England. The best ones keep the rain off and are convenient to carry, whether in hand or inside a bag. I’m also selective about colourways, materials, design and construction.If I’m under a brolly, there’s a good chance I’m either on my way to field-test a product or nipping to the library where I do much of my writing. I’ve extensive experience reviewing useful things, fromtravel pillowstoreusable cups, for titles including the Filter. For the past decade or so, I’ve devoted much of my time to working out what differentiates one product from the next, and what really matters to the user.How I testedPete Wise stands on a rural hill holding various umbrellas – some have reversed in the windAs well as using them in the rain, we tested all the brollies’ wind resistance on top of the Peak District’s Mam Tor. Video: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianThroughout October 2025, I carried each umbrella and used it in daily life, noting how effectively it sheltered me from rain and wind. I considered how convenient each model was to use and carry. Did it cover my head, shoulders and torso adequately? Was it comfortable to hold? And would a sudden gust of wind turn its canopy inside out?For a sterner test of resilience and wind resistance, I opened the umbrellas in strong winds (and clung on for dear life) near the summit of Mam Tor, a highly exposed, 517-metre hill in the Peak District, which overlooks part ofthe newly minted Steel Cotton Rail Trail. At an altitude greater than the height of any building in Europe, this seemed like an adequate testing ground to see how the brollies would handle a stiff breeze. (Thanks to photographer Christian Hopewell for capturing the fun, and to Alice Ostapjuk-Wise for helping it run smoothly.)Of course, not all umbrellas are designed for use in extreme conditions. Each of the reviews below reflects the umbrella’s performance against the manufacturer’s claims, as well as how it fared during hilltop testing.I assessed 15 umbrellas in total, and have featured the best selection here. After testing, I took the wind-buffeted brollies to my localMindcharity shop.The best umbrellas in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianBest umbrella overall:London Undercover ClassicView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£115 at London UndercoverThe London Undercover Classic emerged as the top performer in both day-to-day use and hilltop testing.Why we love itIt’s a beautifully finished item with exceptional components, right down to the frilly, orange rosette on the runner. Each design has a pleasant colour contrast on the underside to add some cheer to your under-brolly microclimate, which proved impressively dry in this umbrella’s case. I found the slim, elegant maple hook handle very comfortable to hold, with just the right hint of tangible grain to add grip to its smoothness.The canopy is made entirely from recycled polyethylene terephthalate fabric. It comprises two layers of material – a dual-layer design– and this is key to the Classic’s exceptional wind resistance. During my hilltop testing, it withstood very strong gusts without inverting, and even when I held it high into the air, it only inverted slightly at one side.As the canopy is fairly deep, there’s very good coverage of the head and shoulders. For taller users, a wider model might be better for the torso and legs.It’s a shame that …at £115, this umbrella is a serious investment, although I would argue that you’re getting outstanding quality in return. Still, most of the other brollies featured here cost far less.Weight:500gLength (folded):91.5cmCanopy diameter:105cmWarranty:one year (and exceptional cases considered over a longer period)Best budget umbrella:Doppler Zero 99View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£29.99 at Doppler£29.99 at AmazonAre you the sort of person who sometimes ends up buying an ultra-cheap brolly from a cut-price shop on unexpectedly rainy days? I suspect many of us are.Why we love itThis fairly priced, pocket-sized brolly from Doppler is a better, eco-friendlier solution for those who want convenient access to a brolly, without ladening themselves down. The weight and size are negligible, so you can pop it inside your bag for permanent storage and pluck it out with satisfaction whenever rain starts to fall. When I used it on the sodden streets of Leeds, it proved a helpful companion during moderate showers, although the small-ish canopy diameter meant my legs received a dousing.Its features are cleverly designed to minimise the heft, especially the small, circular grip at the bottom of the pole, which is just as clutchable as a knob but a fraction of the size. For the price you’re paying, the design is outstanding.It’s a shame that…this lightweight umbrella is highly prone to inverting in the wind, and coverage is relatively limited. It could keep your head and shoulders dry in a shower, but as I discovered on the windy peak of Mam Tor, it’s not suitable for challenging weather.Weight:99gLength (folded):21cmCanopy diameter:90cmWarranty:three yearsBest folding umbrella:Blunt Metro UmbrellaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£75 at Blunt Umbrellas£74.70 at AmazonThe Blunt Metro is a statement piece that will bring sunshine to a rainy day – especially if you’ve chosen the citrus yellow colour I received for testing.Why we love itIt feels very sturdy and durable, and the sweetly shaped canopy proved broad enough to keep my head and shoulders dry. The automatic opening action is very smooth, although I did find that the button was easy to press accidentally, as it’s incorporated so deftly into the handle.Victorian Londoners were crying out for this brolly: an initial brake on their uptake of umbrellas was the risk of collisions on crowded streets – so argued William Sangster in his book of 1855, Umbrellas and Their History.The Metro has a unique and brilliant solution for this continuing problem: it can spin freely through 360 degrees when open, so it rolls breezily away when knocked.Like every other folding umbrella I tested, the Metro soon inverted once held open to strong wind on the hilltop, but it popped back into shape easily enough. It stood up well against sudden gusts in day-to-day use, with no inverting where other small brollies failed.It’s a shame that …this umbrella has the odd trait of sending a shower of droplets back towards you when you try to shake it dry. You’re better off letting it drip.Weight:385gLength (folded):37.5cmCanopy diameter:100cmWarranty:two yearsBest-looking umbrella:Oswin Hyde JosephView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£49 at Debenhams£49 at BurtonThis Oswin Hyde umbrella is remarkable for its currently reduced price of £49 (RRP: £75). It looks beautiful, with a many-ribbed, rounded shape that’s reminiscent of traditional Indian state umbrellas (calledchatra). Most of the components feel of good quality (although they’re not at the premium end of the market), and the brolly rolls up prettily for carrying or storage inside its protective sleeve.Why we love itI found this a very pleasant umbrella to shelter under, with broad coverage and pleasing acoustics that made my voice sound uncharacteristically interesting while recording notes, mid-review. It’s broad enough to prevent vertical or near-vertical rain from hitting most parts of the body, although I’d recommend something with a deeper canopy for sideways rain. It’s wide enough for two people to shelter under, and the attractive shape and detailing might make it a romantic choice for shared use.While this umbrella did invert in the wind, without needing as much blustery coercion as some of its competitors, I was impressed with how it bounced back from these episodes. It’s clear that the ribs are highly flexible, which should help them to resist damage.It’s a shame that …this isn’t quite as robust as some of the higher-end brollies we’ve reviewed. I found that the tip can be dented easily.Weight:658gLength (folded):92cmCanopy diameter:112cmWarranty:six monthsBest mini umbrella:Davek MiniView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£60 at DavekA charming little helper that lives happily in a handbag or rucksack, the Davek Mini is the finest miniature umbrella I’ve ever unfurled. I enjoyed admiring its elaborate frame (fibreglass reinforced for wind resistance) from beneath its brightly hued canopy. In ferocious winds at the summit of Mam Tor, it held up for longer than other folding models before turning inside out. However, I wouldn’t recommend it for use in blustery weather.Why we love itThis brolly feels incredibly light, and if you study the fine details, you’ll appreciate how it came to be so. For instance, the handle is tiny and hollow, but it’s surprisingly comfortable and nicer to grasp than many of its more bulbous rivals. I’d suggest using the slightly elasticated wrist strap at the same time, since this allows a more casual grip without fear of dropping.The canopy is broader than you might expect, with a diameter that rivals some mid-size umbrellas. It kept my head dry during rain showers, although the same can’t be said for my gangly legs.It’s a shame that …it costs £60, which is steep for a mini umbrella. However, factoring in the lifetime guarantee, this could be a prudent choice in the long term.Weight:225gLength (folded):17cmCanopy diameter:86cmWarranty:unconditional lifetime guaranteeskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The windproof, vented canopy proved highly effective at resisting inversion in strong winds, even when gusts were so powerful that I started to lose my footing.Why we love itFulton describes this canopy as “supersize”, and at 136cm in diameter, it’s certainly the largest I’ve tested. There’s ample coverage for two people to shelter without catching the runoff from the umbrella’s sides. Its fabric, with the concave dips between the rib tips, nicely frames your view of the world.The Titan 1’s construction is impressive, too, especially considering the affordable pricing. Its lightweight, fibreglass frame has remarkable flexibility and gives the brolly a bouncy feel in hand.Rather than a sleeve, the Titan comes in a carry case with a shoulder strap, allowing for easier, hands-free transportation.It’s a shame that …this umbrella can sometimes make your forearms ache. Holding it by the straight grip (which is undoubtedly comfy), I found it easy to rest back on my shoulder, but quite strenuous to hold forwards into the wind.Weight:950gLength (folded):98cmCanopy diameter:136cmWarranty:all manufacturing faults consideredThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Resisted inversion impressively’: the Davek Elite.Photograph: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianFulton Minilite2View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£26 at John Lewis£12.05 at AmazonBest for:a pocket umbrellaFulton makes this Minilite 2 style with various printed canopies, including retro stripes, art prints and the glitter bow version shown.It’s a cheerful, affordable option, and I enjoyed seeing the shimmering pattern through the material as I walked under streetlights on a rainy night.It was prone to inverting in the breeze, although the aluminium frame proved wind resistant, as promised, with no signs of damage after a sojourn in powerful winds. The folded size is suitable for handbags and backpacks.It didn’t make the final cut because …it feels quite rickety compared with the other options featured here.Weight:236g;length (folded):25cm;canopy diameter:96cm;warranty:all manufacturing faults consideredPaul Smith compact umbrellaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£120 at Paul Smith£120 at John LewisBest for:a designer umbrellaWould you like an umbrella with ample coverage and a classic aesthetic, or one that fits inside a rucksack? Where most brands make you choose, this one from Paul Smith covers all the bases. Its canopy is wide and deep, and the telescopic pole allows it to fold down to a manageable size.My favourite touch here is the wooden crook handle – a rarity in folding umbrellas. There’s just the right degree of irregularity to the finishing around its edges.It didn’t make the final cut because …although it’s mid-size, this umbrella fared little better than smaller folding models when used in strong winds. It inverted quickly during my stress test in the Peak District.Weight:433gLength (folded):47cmCanopy diameter:100cmWarranty:two yearsKnirps T200 DuomaticView image in fullscreen£69.99 at Knirps£61.98 at AmazonBest for:automatic opening and closingI was impressed with this smart-looking, meticulously engineered folding umbrella from Knirps. While not quite as small as some mini or pocket folding umbrellas, it will fit comfortably inside a good-size backpack or handbag. The automatic open-close mechanism is supremely smooth, and the bright, red button that activates it positively begs to be pressed.It has a dual-rib assembly that gives it strength when inverted by the wind, as well as when held head-on, and apparently this has been tested in a wind tunnel at up to 150km an hour.It didn’t make the final cut because …while the frame could indeed withstand a battering from the wind, the T200 was just as quick to invert as other lightweight models. So, while it might not sustain damage in windy weather, it’s perhaps not the best brolly to use in these conditions.Weight:320g;length (folded):28cm;canopy diameter:98cm;warranty:five yearsLifeventure Medium TrekView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£21.99 at Lifeventure£22 at Cotswold OutdoorBest for:UV protectionBefore umbrellas were used to keep off rain, parasols shielded people from the sun. A growing trend among trekkers and mountaineers has seen small, lightweight umbrellas added to packing lists for both purposes, making brollies just as relevant on the mission to base camp as they are on the walk to work.This Lifeventure model is a good example of the type, with automatic open-close, a grippy pleather handle and – here’s the important part – UPF50+ sun protection. I thought it felt strong and light, and the opening mechanism is excellent.It didn’t make the final cut because …the Trek’s wind resistance is modest (although not bad for a folding model), so it’s best suited to sun or rain protection on still days.Weight:380g;length (folded):32cm;canopy diameter:97cm;warranty:three yearsDavek EliteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Hopewell/The Guardian£159 at DavekBest for:a formal occasionThis sleek city umbrella (or “cane umbrella”) from luxury brand Davek is a perfect match for smart outerwear or suiting. In this black colourway, it has a slightly “goth winter” feel to it, with a stitched leather handle and elongated rib tips.During our high-winds testing, the Elite resisted inversion impressively, and it soon returned to the desired shape once turned back to face the wind. The fibreglass frame proved highly flexible and resilient to stress.It didn’t make the final cut because …personally, I preferred other umbrellas in a similar price range. That’s not to say this isn’t a great brolly, though.Weight:708g;length (folded):89cm;canopy diameter:112cm;warranty:unconditional lifetime guaranteeWhat youneed to knowPete Wise stands on a rural hill holding various umbrellas – some have reversed in the windStormproof umbrellas fared best in the hilltop tests. Video: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianFeatures to look out forAutomatic opening(and sometimes closure) is a nice-to-have feature that makes using an umbrella that little bit easier. It’s common in golf umbrellas and even more so in folding umbrellas, which employ a telescopic pole (or shaft) for compact portability.Stormproofor windproof umbrellas have vents or dual layers of fabric to allow gusts through. Models with these features clearly proved to be the best at resisting inversion (or dragging me towards a cliff edge) during my testing in high winds. Another feature widely used in windproof models is a double ribbed frame, which tends to make the umbrella more resilient to the push and pull of high winds.What types of umbrellas are there?City umbrellasare the traditional choice in the UK, with a long, solid pole and a wide canopy. Most have a curved handle called a “hook” or “crook” – interchangeable terms in umbrella anatomy.Sportier and often with brighter-coloured canopies,golf umbrellasare another large, non-folding option. For some reason (perhaps in an aggressive move towards caddies), many have straight grip handles.Folding umbrellas– also known as portable umbrellas or even pocket umbrellas – have been around since the Victorian period. The best modern examples are made with super-lightweight materials and can endure blustery conditions without breaking. Thanks to their telescopic shafts, they’re easy to slip into a rucksack or handbag, so you can keep one handy for unexpected showers.What’s the difference between an umbrella and a parasol?In the UK, it has been largely unfashionable to use handheld umbrellas for sun protection since Victorian times. This is a shame, since blocking potentially harmful rays is one of an umbrella’s strengths.An umbrella especially for sun protection is called a parasol. These far predate modern (rain-focused) umbrellas, as evidenced by records from ancient Egypt and Assyria, to name a few early parasol hotspots.The two types, or uses, of an umbrella-shaped item are now practically inseparable in terms of silhouette and construction.

I’m really shocked at the way this is now impacting on NHS staff,” he said.He also criticised unnamed politicians who condone racism, adding: “I’m disgusted that a level of racism last seen when Britain was a very different country, 50 years ago, has made an ugly comeback and I’m frankly shocked by those in parliament who’ve leaned into it.”His remarks come a week after the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) revealed that thenumber of racist incidents that nurses suffer at work has surgedover recent years.Streeting added: “I had a Labour [MP] colleague whose daughter – a resident doctor – works in a hospital where a man said he only wanted to be treated by white staff. Although she was Asian, she had slightly fairer skin. And a colleague said: ‘Will you go and see if maybe he’ll accept you?’ And rightly she turned around and said: ‘No, I won’t, actually. Go and tell him that he either wants our care or he doesn’t, but he doesn’t get to racially discriminate.’ She made the right call.“The NHS is not immune from the prejudices of wider society but we’ve got to take a zero tolerance [approach]. Your right to free healthcare in this country does not come with the freedom to abuse our staff on any grounds.“We’ve got to call time on racism in this country and we’ve got to put that ugly racist sentiment that’s found expression in our country back in its box and once again create a climate in this country where it is not socially acceptable to be racist.”Prof Nicola Ranger, the RCN’s chief executive, endorsed Streeting’s remarks about politicians inflaming racial tensions. “The rise in the racist abuse that staff face is a stain on society and a stain on our NHS.“Racism is an issue across society and is particularly pertinent in health and care services, with such a diverse workforce. We have to recognise that the increasing use of anti-migrant rhetoric in politics is emboldening racist behaviour.”Prof Habib Naqvi, the chief executive of the NHS Race andHealthObservatory, said: “It’s shocking to see the levels of racism within our communities and across modern Britain today – levels that we have not witnessed for decades. We know our NHS is not immune from this scourge because it is a microcosm of wider society – what happens on our streets and within society does play out in the 1.5 million people that work in the NHS.”Mackey and Streeting admitted that, despite the NHS in England preparing more thoroughly for winter than ever before, some trusts would “struggle” to maintain normal service during the cold spell, in which A&E units are expected to see record numbers of people seeking care.“I want to be upfront with people, especially at a time when trust in politics is in even shorter supply than money. When there are problems this winter, and there will be problems this winter, there will be hospitals where there are people on trolleys in corridors.”Mackey added that corridor care –highlighted graphically by Age UK last week– is “one of the things that keeps me awake at night” and “one of the horrible, visible signs of drifting standards over recent years. It’s completely unacceptable.”He added that: “I’m really hopeful that we’ll manage it [winter] well. But it’s important to be realistic. There’s a lot of flu around, there’s been a lot of Covid around and the industrial action issue is a complexity we could do without.”Nearly 150,000 aged 90 and above wait 12 hours in England’s A&Es each yearRead moreThe four hospitals in Bristol and Weston-super-Mare have been on a “critical incident” – meaning emergency-footing – and receiving help from other NHS trusts since last Thursday because of an “exceptionally high demand” for care.Some hospitals, such as those in Lincolnshire have told patients, visitors and staff in some care areas to wear a face mask from next week to curb the spread of viruses.Resident – formerly junior – doctors in Englandwant a 29% pay rise. Tens of thousands of them are due to go on strike for five days from 14 November in pursuit of their claim, in what will be their 13th walkout since March 2023. Their last strike in July cost the NHS an estimated £250m.Streeting urged the British Medical Association, the main doctors’ union, to call off next week’s action. It is unjustified because resident doctors’ salaries have risen by 28.9% over the last three years, he said.“The impact it [strikes] will have on winter really worries me. Everyone is going to lose if this goes ahead. Patients are going to suffer because of the disruption and impact on the service. Doctors and other NHS staff will suffer because they have to pick up the pieces of the disruption. And this time it will be taking place against the backdrop of winter. But resident doctors themselves [will also] lose”, he added.Explore more on these topicsNHSWes StreetingRaceHealthTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

So I’m being honest with people.”But she added that easing the cost of living would be one of her three main priorities, alongside reducing the national debt and protecting the NHS.At the early morning Downing Street event, Reeves hinted at tax rises, adding that “each of us must do our bit” for the country’s future. “If we have to build the future of Britain together, we will all have to contribute to that effort.”“I have to face the world as it is, not the world that I want it to be. And when challenges come our way, the only question is how to respond to them, not whether to respond or not.”View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves told the media this morning that she had to face ‘the world as it is’.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAThe chancellor added the economic challenges facing the UK – including global tariffs, sticky inflation, volatile supply chains and defence spending – had got worse since last year’s financial statement.Cabinet ministers, braced for a consequential tax-raising budget later this month, warned that the public needed to feel the direct benefit of any increases.“We have to be absolutely crystal clear if we’re doing this about how we link it to what it delivers for voters. What are we doing for them if we do this?” one minister said. “I’m not saying it’s not high stakes. But it had better fucking work,” another added.A third minister said they had concluded that voters wanted Labour to fix public services even if they did not like how it was paid for. Several told the Guardian they believed the election pledge on tax was “stupid” for an opposition party.In a sign of internal government concerns over the possible market reaction, Labour has organised a series of pre-budget “economic insight sessions” for Labour MPs with economists and former ministers in recent weeks.Reeves and the prime minister have identified high energy bills as being a major source of financial pressure for voters and are planning a relief package likely to cost about £3bn a year.Keir Starmer is understood to be particularly worried about the impact of an expected £100 rise in energy bills next spring, and wants to do enough to eliminate that and bring down costs even further.A major part of the plan, insiders say, will be eliminating the 5% VAT rate on part or all of domestic energy bills, in a move that experts say would cost £2.5bn a year and bring down bills by an average of £86.Some economists warn such a move would risk benefiting those with larger homes and encouraging people to use more energy, but the Treasury is understood to be keen on the idea because it is simple and quick to implement.Alongside the VAT reduction, Reeves is planning to reduce or eliminate some of the green levies on bills, which could reduce costs for householders and undercut Reform’s promise to do the same.However, energy industry insiders say raiding energy efficiency funding to help pay for the move would be “disastrous”.Prospect of breaking 50-year income tax taboo shows scale of Reeves’s challengeRead moreThose consulted on the plans say the chancellor is particularly looking at reducing or eliminating the energy company obligation, under which energy firms help pay for home improvement measures such as insulation and new heating schemes. Last year, the National Audit Officewarned offraud and poor quality in some of the work undertaken under the scheme.If the programme is reduced or cut entirely, the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, could choose to reallocate money from the £13bn warm homes plan, much of which is earmarked to pay for subsidies for electric heat pumps.The government decidedas recently as Juneto protect the scheme, but the chancellor is thought to be willing to see it reduced to help bring bills down now.Reeves is also weighing up cutting other levies, such as the renewable obligation certificate programme, which currently goes up by retail price inflation but could be tied instead to the lower consumer price index.The Treasury declined to comment on budget speculation, but those in the energy industry say the plans could backfire in the longer term.1:48Rachel Reeves avoids answering question on tax rises in pre-budget speech – videoIn her speech, the chancellor also accused previous governments of putting “political convenience” before “economic imperative”, raiding capital budgets intended to support the public services to balance the books.“The problem of the last 14 years is that political expediency always came above the national interest. And that is why we are in the mess that we are in today,” she added.The cost of UK borrowing fell slightly as the chancellor reiterated her “iron-clad” commitment to her fiscal rules, reassuring the bond markets.After the speech, Starmer told his cabinet the budget would neither starve the state of cash nor take “risks with more borrowing”, inferring that tax rises are the only option.Government sources said the prime minister had accepted the necessity of the move. “Even if everything is exploding around him, he has a plan and knows the direction we’re going in,” they added.Dhara Vyas, the chief executive ofEnergyUK, said: “Billions of pounds of investment have been on hold while we await the warm homes plan – all of which could be jeopardised by any sudden change of direction. So hijacking the plan’s budget and effectively abandoning its original purpose would be a shortsighted and disastrous move.“We’ve had ample previous experience showing how kneejerk cuts to investment in warmer homes have resulted in customers paying billions of pounds more on their energy bills, while also damaging supply chains and businesses with knock on impacts to investment and job losses.”Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Rachel ReevesBudgetEnergy billsEnergyHousehold billsTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

While the review recommended keeping Progress 8, the DfE said it wants to reform the measure.The changes would “encourage students to study a greater breadth of GCSE subjects including the arts, humanities and languages alongside English, maths and science”, according to a government spokesperson.Phillipson said: “It has been over a decade since the national curriculum was updated, and it’s more crucial than ever that young people are equipped to face the challenges of today, so they can seize the exciting opportunities that life has to offer.”The DfE also used its response to announce new proposals including “a new set of enrichment benchmarks” that would require schools to offer “access to civic engagement, arts and culture, nature and adventure, sport, and life skills”, to be inspected by Ofsted and advertised to parents through a new “school profiles” information service.The department’s response also mentioned that it was “exploring a new language qualification which banks progress and motivates pupils to want to continue studying, complementing existingGCSEsand A-levels”.Di’Iasio said: “We see that the education secretary has now randomly announced that a new set of enrichment benchmarks will be added to the many expectations over which schools are judged without a word about how this will be resourced.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This will help the next generation to be better informed and choose their own future path. It will put young people, and the UK economy, in a stronger position to benefit from the green transition that the world is already going through.”Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, described the proposals as “education vandalism” on the part of Phillipson.“Labour’s idea of boosting social mobility is to teach primary school children about climate change instead of making sure they can read, write and add up properly.“These reforms will mean children moving towards an ‘enrichment entitlement’ and see fewer children studying history and languages, post-14. This will leave children with a weaker understanding of our national story and hide standards slipping in schools.”The government said it aimed to publish the revised national curriculum by spring 2027, for teaching in classrooms from September 2028.Explore more on these topicsNational curriculumSchoolsGCSEsDepartment for EducationCurriculumsExamsSatsShareReuse this content"

Radiohead haven’t recorded a studio album since 2016, and each of the band members has been involved in other successful and creatively stimulating projects, so fans were beginning to wonder if they might never hear from them again.But there was excitement last year at the news the band had reconvened for casual rehearsals, then a frenzied rush for tickets when new shows were announced in September, and finally a rapturous reception in Madrid for this concert in the round.With little chat with the crowd beyond the occasional “gracias”, the British quintet played 21 songs, opening with Let Down from 1997’s OK Computer and adding other songs from the highly lauded first half of their career including Paranoid Android, Karma Police, Fake Plastic Trees, Idioteque and No Surprises.But while they didn’t shy away from well-known songs, it was no greatest hits set, bringing in numerous album tracks and drawing heavily from 2003’s Hail to the Thief.View image in fullscreenFans queue outside Madrid’s Movistar Arena on Tuesday.Photograph: Ashifa KassamAn hour or so before the sun rose over Madrid, Francesco Puddu had staked out a prime spot in front of the city’s hulking Movistar Arena. He was among the first Radiohead fans to arrive at the venue, buzzing with expectations.“I’m incredibly excited. Like, I don’t think it’s real,” said the 27-year-old, who had travelled from Italy. “It’s been so long that even if they play the same song 20 times in a row, I’ll be happy.”The hours passed quickly as fans plotted where to position themselves in front of the circular stage, and revelled in the fact that they were among the privileged ones who had scored tickets for a tour that had sold out in minutes.The war in Gaza was another topic that had come up throughout the day, given that the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israelhad calledon people to boycott the tour, citing band member Jonny Greenwood’s 2024 performance in Tel Aviv.The topic seemingly remains sensitive for the band: after the Guardian reported onthe boycott callin September, its journalists were blocked from receiving tickets to review the Madrid concert. The band have not commented on the decision.In Spain, wherehundreds of thousandshave taken to the streets in solidarity with Palestine, the band’s actions had left some fans conflicted.“It would have been nice if they had spoken out about it much earlier,” said Lola, 22, who asked that her last name not be published. “As a fan of Radiohead, I was a little bit disappointed. But at least I think they learned their lesson.”View image in fullscreenAlessandra Fossati: ‘They always change from one record to another, they never do the same thing.’Photograph: Ashifa KassamShe pointed to the incident last year in Melbourne, when the band’s frontman, Thom Yorke, brieflywalked off stageduring a solo gig after a pro-Palestinian heckler shouted: “How many dead children will it take for you to condemn the genocide in Gaza?”It was not the right way to respond, said Lola. “I didn’t like that reaction.” In the end, however, the music had won her over. “I obviously can’t control what I feel when I listen to music … I really wanted to come and listen to the voices and sounds that I’ve been listening to since I was 12 years old.”Yorke laterreleased a statementsaying the incident in Melbourne left him “in shock that my supposed silence was somehow being taken as complicity”, describing the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his administration as “extremists” who “need to be stopped”.Before the European tour, Yorketold the Sunday Timesthat he would “absolutely not” perform in Israel. “I wouldn’t want to be 5,000 miles anywhere near the Netanyahu regime,”he added.Some defended the band, citing their long history of activism. “They’ve always stood for peace, they can’t have changed now,” said Alessandra Fossati. “I think the people who know them, know that they are on the right side.”Tuesday’s concert was to be the 50th time she had seen Radiohead perform, after becoming hooked when she first saw them live in 1995.This time she had tickets for five of the shows: opening night in Madrid and every single performance in her home country of Italy.“They always change from one record to another, they never do the same thing,” she said as she showed off her two Radiohead-themed tattoos. “I mean, I used to be a U2 fan but they kept doing the same things. And after a while you get bored.”For some, the fact that the band had gone seven years without performing together had injected a sense of urgency into the new tour.“There might not be another opportunity, Radiohead is pretty old at this point,” said Luka Arreaza, 20, prompting laughter from those waiting in line beside him. “So it was really worth it to come here and share this moment.”The band, formed when they were at school in Oxfordshire in 1985, have become a byword for cerebral, atmospheric – and non-fans would say morose – rock music. They are still easily able to fill arenas thanks to a run of nine studio albums ranging from solid to utterly classic.View image in fullscreenRadiohead in 1997.Photograph: Roger Sargent/ShutterstockTheir debut, 1994’s Pablo Honey, contained their breakthrough hit Creep, which has spent much of the last four months back in the UK Top 100 as the band earn a new generation of fans. Let Down, from third album OK Computer, also re-entered the charts this year.OK Computer is regarded by many critics as the greatest rock album of the 1990s, though if anything the esteem is even higher for its follow-up Kid A, for which the band stretched out further into electronic music.Their sixth, 2007’s In Rainbows (made available via a download that fans could set their own price for) is regarded as another creative pinnacle, but the band’s sense of adventure was clearly still felt on the albums since, The King of Limbs (2011) and A Moon Shaped Pool (2016).Yorke has put out a series of solo and group albums, mostly recently with his trio the Smile, alongsideJonny Greenwood(lead guitar/keyboards).Greenwood has found huge success as a film composer, earning two Oscar nominations for Phantom Thread and The Power of the Dog, and may get a third for the critically adored One Battle After Another, the fifth of his collaborations with director Paul Thomas Anderson.Guitarist Ed O’Brien released his debut solo album in 2020, and drummer Phil Selway released his third in 2023. Bassist Colin Greenwood has been a sideman for artists including Nick Cave, and in 2024 he published How to Disappear: a Portrait of Radiohead, a book of his photographs of Radiohead taken between 2003 and 2016.Another waiting fan was Sergio Zapater, who had arrived luggage in hand after taking a morning train from Valencia.The last time the 53-year-old had seen Radiohead was 22 years ago. This time, he had arrived at the venue more than nine hours before the concert was due to start, certain that he would be the first in line.Instead he found himself confronted by the fact that a new generation – one that seemingly did not mind early hours or queues – had fallen for Radiohead’s “evolved, elaborate, soul-touching” tunes.“I was surprised to find all these young people here,” he said with a laugh. “How annoying, I thought I would be first in line because older people don’t do these things. But now I’m 25th.”After four nights in Madrid, Radiohead’s tour will travel to Bologna, London, Copenhagen and Berlin, concluding on 12 December.Explore more on these topicsRadioheadSpainThom YorkeJonny GreenwoodEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Two models from different generations discuss the highs and lows of the industry, from the joy of travel and dressing up to predatory behaviour and physical pressuresLucy KnightTue 4 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 06.02 ESTShareIt’s easy to think of models as people whose lives are full of glitz and glamour, who “don’t wake up for less than $10,000 a day”. But according to New York-based Danielle Mareka, 27, and 62-year-old Dee O, who lives in London, the reality for most models is a constant hustle to get noticed.That’s not to mention keeping up with the fashion world’s changing landscape: since O began modelling in 1983, the internet and social media have transformed the way the industry operates. And models are now navigating innovations such asAI models appearing in Vogueand theimpact of GLP-1 weight-loss drugson the sector. O and Mareka met to discuss their careers past and present.How did youget into modelling?Dee O:I came from an Irish immigrant working-class background, and grew up in Birmingham. My boyfriend, without me knowing, entered me into a Face of 1983 competition. I think I was 17 or 18 at the time. Then I suddenly heard from Look Now magazine, saying we’d like you to be part of the Birmingham finalists. I won the Birmingham final, so I, along with girls from all over the country, went to London for a weekend and they put us up in a hotel. I didn’t win Face of 1983, but the agency running the prize still asked to represent me. So I started commuting back and forth from Birmingham, catching coaches from Victoria at 2am after eating some horrible sandwich.View image in fullscreenComposite: Christian Sinibaldi for The GuardianDanielle Mareka:I was born in New York to Guyanese-American parents, and grew up watching America’s Next Top Model. That really influenced me wanting to be a model, but my family said I had to wait until I got to college. I kind of dabbled in my teens, but if it interrupted school that was a huge no-no. When I was at NYU studying for a public health degree, I ran track and someone on my team was into photography. That’s how it started – we were in one of the dorm rooms taking photos and then, for fashion week, I would look on Instagram to find casting directors or designers. Then I joined this boutique agency WeSpeak, which was started by a model and is all about models speaking up for themselves.How have your careersgone since then?DO:When I was about 29, I drifted out of modelling and decided I needed to get a real job. I went to university and then worked in education. Then my daughter, who’s 27 now, started modelling, and she encouraged me to get back into it. I was really reluctant to do it. Anyway, here I am five years later – I signed with the Grey agency, which has very diverse models, and jobs still come along. I actually love doing it now because I don’t have that same stress I had when I was younger.DM:After five years, I took a break from WeSpeak because I wasn’t sure if I’d peaked out. I tried this new agency for a year and a half, which was more traditional and corporate. We really did not connect, and we both thought it was best for us to go our separate ways. I found myself back at WeSpeak, and while I’m in London doing shows with one of my New York clients, I’ve been shopping around for a UK agent. A lot of people don’t give feedback – they just said I’m not quite right for them.View image in fullscreenDanielle wears Christopher John Rogers, pre-autumn 2023 collection.Photograph: César BuitragoDO:It’s always so vague! It’s so hard because you want to grab them and go, can you just be honest with me? And say, you’ve just signed 20 other girls and five of them are my fucking twin.Dee, how has being a model changed since you started out?DO:Back then, you weren’t talking to anybody, the agent talks to everybody – it’s like: that’s why I’m giving them 20% – you just shut up and turn up on the day with a clean face. A lot of models now, they’re writers, they’re stylists, no one is one thing. Using social media and finding your own work is how it needs to be done now.In 2020 Black representation in modelling felt like a renaissance. Now a lot of Black models have been droppedDM:Yeah, I have a pretty solid social media presence, and during Covid I had some viral moments. A lot of my career has been me just being online and finding the person to contact.Does being a model change the way you see yourself?DM:Some shoots have made me think: do these people even like how I look? Do I like how I look? For a while, I honestly did not even think I was beautiful – it takes a toll on you.DO:Very subtly, if we are constantly putting our own needs and desires and identity aside, it’s got to have, over the long term, some kind of impact on your mental health. When I started in the early 1980s, we weren’t far after the debutantes, and the mindset was very class oriented – I felt like an interloper. There’s also the very personal side of it, when you’re comparing yourself to other women.View image in fullscreenComposite: Christian Sinibaldi for The GuardianI suppose, by definition, models are seen and not heard, but does constantly having to bend to someone else’s will mean that people take advantage of models?DO:I saw a bit of predatory, pre-MeToo stuff in the 80s. I was fairly lucky because I was a bit gobby so I think they kind of stayed away from me. But I felt it. I also felt that if I had gone out for dinner with that guy or gone to that party, I might have got more jobs. The power was with a lot of men and you definitely felt like you were disposable.DM:I’ve always been super liberal. At NYU I was working with Planned Parenthood and giving talks about reproductive justice and women’s rights. But when I was with my previous [more corporate] agency, I found myself getting quieter about things because I was scared I would get dropped. Since then, I’ve worked with theModel Alliance, which is the closest thing we have to a union. They have been working on theFashion Workers Act, which was passed in New York last year, which gives models more protection. But even after that, I’ve met models who have been asked by their agency to sign another agreement on top of the law. I think there are people who still prey on young people and their lack of knowledge.DO:Yeah, the naivety and the dream and the desperation.DM:When you join the worker council at Model Alliance, they have you sign something just to let you know that getting dropped by your agent because of your connection to the organisation is a possibility. I did not have any idea it was that serious or that taboo.I haven’t had Botox or plastic surgery and I have fought against itThe Fashion Workers Act isan amazing achievement. Is progressbeing made in other areas?DO:There’s still a lot of very stereotypical six-foot-something, size eight or six models on runways – you see the odd show where they throw somebody different in. There’s a designer I’ve worked with calledAshish Gupta, who deliberately uses a very diverse group of models. In fact, his show at London fashion week was all dancers and they danced around the catwalk. It’s things like that that really excite me. The other bit I am very happy to see now is people looking at where clothing comes from, what it’s doing to the planet and what [workers are] getting paid. I love fashion, but I am a vintage secondhand queen, and I’m really proud of that.View image in fullscreenDee models for JD Williams.Photograph: JD WilliamsDM:In terms of Black representation in modelling, in 2020 it felt like this renaissance. After the Black Lives Matter protests, I was making so much money and I was booking so many campaigns and it felt like everyone was being represented. And now, it does feel like things have pulled back. A lot of the Black models have been dropped. The other thing on shoots is that stylists often aren’t trained to work with Black hair – I’ve ended up getting heat damage.We hear a lot about the pressure on models to be thin. Have you experienced that?DO:There was a girl I shared a flat with in my early days. She was naturally about a [UK] 12 [US 8]. She lived on apples and rotted her teeth, and was bulimic, just to try to make the agency she was with accept her and get down to the size they wanted. In the end she got really sick and fell apart and went back home, and that was the end of that. I’ve never forgotten that, and she’s not the only one.DM:Naturally this has been my figure for years, and I feel like because of that I might not know or perceive as much of that demand to be thin because I already fit. But when I first started pursuing this, because I was running track I was a lot more muscular, and I remember a meeting when I was told: “You’re going to have to change your measurements,” and that wrecked me mentally.DO:It has a massive impact on your psyche. But at the same time you’re seeing such huge diversity out there in sizes and shapes now. Although it still seems to be, even when you see the curvaceous girls, they’re still pigeonholed – they’ve got to have that hourglass figure.There are now countless ways to change your appearance, from Botox to weight-loss jabs. Have you noticed these innovations making an impact?DM:When it comes to weight-loss jabs, my curve model friends are saying there’s a shift there and they haven’t been booked for as many runway jobs.‘Drinking was big!’ Pub landlords – one gen Z, one 66 – discuss how they stay open in an age of sobrietyRead moreDO:At one job they stuck those strips of tape on my face to pull back the skin. I was like, if you don’t want my face, why don’t you just book someone a bit younger? I think they’re just as confused as we are. I haven’t had Botox or plastic surgery and I have fought against it. Other models of my age group on shoots have said: “Oh yeah, I’ve just had a bit.” That feels like a massive contradiction to me. But I kind of get it, I feel it sometimes, when I look in the mirror and think: “Maybe if I just …”Are you worried about images of you being used in deepfakes or for training AI?DM:Model Alliance have put a provision in the bill that you need written consent from the model. I do worry that my images will be used, but I don’t know how you grapple with that, because if I post on Instagram, I’ve already made myself very vulnerable.Would you recommend modelling as a career?DM:Yes, it’s just so rewarding and going to work is dress up and play – it gives you this inner-child feeling. But if I had a daughter or son doing it, I would want them to be older; I wouldn’t want them to start when they were 15 or 16.DO:With my daughter, I did what your parents did: “You’ve got to finish college!” I was a little bit apprehensive because obviously I knew what she was going into, but she was very determined. I’m happy she did it. What is wonderful is that she and I do jobs together now.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianDM:I would recommend building a self outside modelling, because for a long time people would recognise me in the street from my TikTok and I kind of made it my only identity for a while. For a long time I felt so lost.DO:I’ve travelled all over the world: for that bit alone, it’s kind of worth it. But you definitely shouldn’t let it be the only thing you’re about, because it can be taken away from you overnight.Explore more on these topicsAll agesModels#MeToo movementAgeingWomenDrugsMedical researchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I assumed that there was some sort of baseline, some inescapable bedrock knowledge of how to do it that now prevents any entry into the art form from falling below a certain standard. But I was wrong. The new series from Ryan Murphy, All’s Fair – starringKim Kardashian, Naomi Watts and Niecy Nash as the founders of an all-female law firm delivering divorce-y justice to incredibly rich but slightly unlucky women under the azure skies of California – is terrible. Fascinatingly, incomprehensibly, existentially terrible. While I try to get my thoughts in order after bearing witness to the first episode, I’m going to give you a few direct quotes, so you can see why I’m struggling.“Let’s put the ‘team’ in ‘teamwork’.”“My flight was turbulent and so is my mood,” says Liberty (Watts) to a man barring her way to a client.“He’s wolf-like in his possessiveness,” says a client of her husband.It’ssoawful, it feels almost contemptuous.‘I wanted to scrape it from my eyeballs’: critics on their zero-star savagingsRead moreI looked for Julian Fellowes’ name in the credits, but apparently this is all the responsibility of Murphy and his co-creators, Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken.They are also executive producers, along with Kim K, her mother Kris Jenner, Watts, Glenn Close (who also has a small role as the protagonists’ early mentor – I cannot imagine what kompromat the Kardashian clan have on her that led to her participation in this dreadful business), Nash and many, many more. The list goes on for ages. I suspect a variation of the bystander effect (whereby the more witnesses there are to a mugging – for example – the less likely any one is to intervene) is in operation. Thus, the more exec producers linked to it, the worse the show.View image in fullscreenSo awful it feels almost contemptuous … Niecy Nash, Glenn Close and Kim Kardashian in All’s Fair.Photograph: Ser Baffo/DisneyStill, there’s worse and then there’s All’s Fair. Beyond the embarrassment of the script, there is the embarrassment of the performances; although I take the point that when someone – in this case, Murphy stalwart Sarah Paulson as psychopathic rival “lady” lawyer Carrington – is required to scream “Are you calling me an ugly duckling? So what if I give myself home perms? It’s economical!”, while smashing up her mentor’s office, they are probably not going to be able to give their best.View image in fullscreen‘Beyond the embarrassment of the script, there is the embarrassment of the performances’ … Kim Kardashian and Naomi Watts in All’s Fair.Photograph: Ser Baffo/DisneyKim K as Allura, married to a football star who is resentful of the shadow cast over his own success by hers, is as expressionless as you might expect, but is at least inoffensively useless. Watts preens and pouts and poses in search of a character, and reminds you of nothing so much asAlly McBeal at her very worst, delivering her lines so archly that you can almost hear her joints cracking. The guest stars are worse. Nash – an unstoppable onscreen force – fares better in a role where the comic intent suits her well. But how parts for Black women are still being written as nothing more than Loud! And Sassy! I do not know. The one good thingAnd Just Like That …ever did was seem to be the nail in that coffin. But All’s Fair makes it look like Heimat.View image in fullscreenDo not even be tempted to watch … Kim Kardashian in All’s Fair.Photograph: Ser Baffo/DisneyIf this was all part of a lurid, camp drama played with gusto by all and narratively stuffed with treats, Murphy might have got away with it. But no one seems to know what they’re doing; the performances seem to respond to about nine different ideas of what the show is and the plots are dismal. The trio (“You’re the best divorce lawyers in town – maybe the country”) wrap up multiple cases in the time it takes Kim K’s nail varnish to dry. There’s the younger wife who falls in love with the woman her husband hires for a threesome, then walks off 10 minutes later with a $210m settlement once Nash acquires video evidence of his extensive perversions. (“Sow teats” is all I’m prepared to say here. Do not let this tempt you into watching.)View image in fullscreenIts concept of female empowerment would have shamed the Spice Girls 30 years ago … Kim Kardashian and Niecy Nash in All’s Fair.Photograph: Ser Baffo/DisneyThere’s the older wife caught cheating (“He wasn’t even attractive! He just looked at me the way you used to look at me!”) and about to be thrown out of the New York marital home by her billionaire husband (“The guy who, like, owns all of cosmetics”) until Liberty flies out on the private jet to tell her she can take the $40m worth of jewellery she owns with her. These are fitted in around a couple of the worst kissing scenes ever seen on screen, the collapse of Allura’s marriage, a jarringly unfashionable obsession with brand names (“Let’s get those Goyard travel cases and start stuffing!”) and conspicuous consumption (“Oh my God – didn’t this belong to Elizabeth Taylor?”). All this, and a concept of female empowerment (“I settled … Did I not love myself enough?”) that would have shamed the Spice Girls 30 years ago.So bad it’s not good.

Released by the White House and housed in theNational Archives, it commemorates the start of their time in office but also carves out a sense of their identity and style.Michelle Obama 2.0 – the reinvention of the former first ladyRead moreNow, 16 years sinceMichelle Obamaappeared in hers wearing a black sleeveless shift dress from the American designer Michael Kors, the former first lady has spoken about the particular outrage caused by her bare arms.Writing in The Look, a new photo book released on Tuesday that documents her style throughout her time in the White House, Obama describes how the media and public’s “fascination” with her bare arms was used as a tool to “otherize” her.The book – which also includes insights from Obama’s stylist Meredith Koop, as well as designers who dressed her for events – aims to offer an insight into how Obama used fashion as a tool for visibility and representation. The American academic Farah Jasmine Griffin writes in a foreword that Obama’s choice of skirts and slacks, and her support of emerging Black, Asian and Latina designers, “lent style to her substance, for always she was a woman of substance – a highly educated woman of ideas and opinions, a woman who reads, listens to music, dances, and has a sense of what our country could be and how to help it get there”.View image in fullscreenFormer first lady Michelle Obama’s second official White House portrait is displayed in the East Room of the White House on 7 September 2022.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/APObama’s preference for a sleeveless silhouette had been well documented. “Michelle Obama goes sleeveless again” read a story in the New York Times as it highlighted how four out of seven of her looks in a single week had been without sleeves, including a pink dress on the cover of Vogue and a blue one as she was pictured chatting to chefs in the White House kitchen.However, it was the appearance of her biceps before Congress as she accompanied her husband, Barack, to his first address to a joint session that really upset her critics, who derided it as everything from “too informal” to “inappropriate” and “out of season”. “Up In Arms,” read one headline. Another tried to coin “Sleevegate”.Although previous first ladies, including Jacqueline Kennedy, had worn sleeveless dresses, Obama notes that they never caused what she calls an “uproar”.“While I am certainly not the only First Lady to get scrutinized – Hillary was constantly dinged for her preference for pantsuits, and Nancy Reagan was lambasted for her love of haute couture – this felt different,” she writes.View image in fullscreenFrom the book Michelle Obama Style published by Penguin.Photograph: Chuck Kennedy/The White House“Barack and I were being portrayed as Black people who didn’t understand the ‘rules’ of the rarefied world we had found ourselves in and were not unequivocally welcomed into.”It was one of many incidences where her style choices were deemed to be “un first lady like”, Obama writes. In 2009, while on a trip to the Grand Canyon to highlight the country’s national parks, she wore shorts, a tank top, an oversized shirt and hiking trainers, attire she felt appropriate for both the rugged terrain and hot weather.The Washington Post fashion reporter Robin Givhan was scathing, calling it “common” in an article that Obama says “I found particularly painful”.“I’d grown to expect this kind of commentary from men and political opponents, but it was upsetting to me that a fellow Black woman would contribute to the pile-on. We were seven months into a brand-new administration, and I was the first Black First Lady trying to find my way.”Obama also reveals struggles within her own team around the “the angry Black” woman stereotype. At one point on the campaign trail, the Obamas’ communications team suggested she modify her facial expressions.View image in fullscreenFrom the book Michelle Obama Style published by Penguin 2025Photograph: Chuck Kennedy/The White House“I’d proven to be an impactful solo orator, and in some places, I was drawing even bigger crowds than Barack’s opponents. And so I was shocked when our communications team shared notes, rather sheepishly, that I should be careful of my tone and facial expressions, because my passion and humor could be weaponized against me.“I can’t remember the first instance I was described as ‘angry’ by the press, only that it was often enough that articles and academic papers have since been written about the phenomenon. While I intellectually understood how that ‘angry Black woman’ trope could be used against me – and frankly, why Black women should be angry – in these instances, I was simply speaking my truth.”Despite her critics, Obama was hailed for many of her choices and for creating opportunities for emerging designer names. For the inaugural ball she was expected to wear Oscar de la Renta, a designer with a long history of dressing first ladies. However, Obama instead chose a gown from Jason Wu, an up-and-coming Taiwan-born and New York-based designer who was raised in Vancouver.View image in fullscreenFormer first lady Michelle Obama attends Becoming: An Intimate Conversation with Michelle Obama at State Farm Arena on 11 May 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia.Photograph: Paras Griffin/Getty Images“Wearing his dress would signal to the world that I was willing to buck the establishment by silently countering the edict ‘this is how it’s always been done’ in the White House,” she writes, adding: “We can’t change history with that attitude.” Images of Obama in Wu’s white silk chiffon one-shoulder gown is now housed in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, and instantly amplified his career.Obama also writes how serving during the height of a US recession led her to make different choices. While Nancy Reagan was known for her love of haute couture and Kennedy favoured Chanel, Obama became known for her “high-low” approach. Alongside designer labels she wore high street fashion labels including H&M, Target and J Crew. “As First Lady, you’re put on a de facto pedestal because the role has historically carried so much ceremonial significance, representing the notion of womanhood itself, of femininity and the spousal ideal,” she writes. “I knew that I had to define my own fashion philosophy, and I was not interested in a “look, don’t touch” approach. If anything, I wanted to invite people in: for an embrace, or a meaningful conversation, and even into the White House, which, from the day we moved in, I wanted to be as open and welcoming as possible (and as security would allow). My clothing had to reflect that.”Explore more on these topicsMichelle ObamaRaceWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This marks a shift fromDonald Trump’s first term, when more celebrities seemed not just comfortable speaking out against the administration, but obligated to do so. Now voters will no longer be able to so easily consult with Notes-app-made posts on Instagram to decide who and what they care about before they head to the polls. The era of movie-star-swung electionshas come to an end.Jennifer Lawrence says speaking about Trump would ‘add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart’Read moreOf course, this era didn’t really exist in earnest. Celebrity opinion doesn’t seem to hold much genuine sway over the public, with thepossible exceptionof the segments of each that belong toTaylor Swift. (Call that an extremely vocal plurality, if not necessarily a majority.) If it did, the George Clooney/Jennifer Lawrence/Tom Hanks/Scarlett Johansson party would soundly thump the Dean Cain/Tim Allen/James Woods/Chuck Norris party in every contest. In her recent interview, Lawrence is speaking to precisely that point, albeit without invoking any catty status differences: “As we’ve learned, election after election, celebrities do not make a difference whatsoever on who people vote for,” she continues. “So then what am I doing [when speaking out against Trump]? I’m just sharing my opinion on something that’s going to add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart.”Lawrence still isn’t actually shy about confirming her feelings (“The first Trump administration was so wild and just, ‘how can we let this stand?’” she says earlier in the interview, and she alludes to the dispiriting feeling when some voters actively chose a second term after seeing the results of the first). Sweeney, for her part, is more genuinely evasive. (“I’m just here to kind of open their eyes to different ideas. That’s why I gravitate towards characters and stories that are complicated and are maybe morally questionable, and characters that are – on the page – hard to like, but then you find the humanity underneath them.”) But the effect is similar: putting the work first and doing that shut-up-and-sing thing that has been thrown around, in some form another, for half a century or more but felt particularly amped-up around the George W Bush administration, when applied to the artists formerly known as theDixie Chicks, among others.View image in fullscreenSydney Sweeney.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesTo some extent, Lawrence is correct to advocate for her work as more potentially meaningful than issuing a statement that underlines her celebrity status, noting that her political views are pretty easy to read in terms of what her production company puts out into the world (including adocumentary about abortion bans), and what she does as a performer: “I don’t want to start turning people off to films and to art that could change consciousness or change the world because they don’t like my political opinions,” she says elsewhere in the interview. “I want to protect my craft so that you can still get lost in what I’m doing, in what I’m showing.” In other words, it’s the artistic principle of “show, don’t tell” bleeding over into politics.More personally, who wouldn’t grow exhausted by the expectation that these opinions should be publicly expressed and available for judgment and nitpicking, and prefer instead to speak through art, if that alternate platform was available to them? Trump doesn’t consume art, but he does perform the old-media equivalent of constant name-searching, which means he is likely to name-check any celebrities with high-profile opposition to him – or even those he senses are somehow aligned with his movement, like Sweeney, whose jeans ad henonsensically praised. Getting dragged into the Trump sphere is a real lose-lose proposition for anyone who wants a genuinely interesting career in the arts. If that sense of self-preservation spares us some cookie-cutterawards show speechesthat don’t move the needle outside of the auditorium applause-o-meter, or Clooneyrelitigatingthe specifics of Democrats’ mistakes and pitfalls in the 2024 election, all the better.The other side of that strategy, though, is a form of quivery brand management that doubles as faulty market research, implying a tidy split between Trump supporters and those who oppose the president’s policies. In fact, 77 million voters pulling the metaphorical lever for Trump in 2024 out of approximately 258 million adults in the US equals a less-than-robust 30%, not 50 – a percentage his approval rating has rarely crossed. Currently, that number continues tosit below 40%by most estimates. Maybe that’s splitting hairs; 77 million voters is a hell of a lot of people, and 37% of 258 million is even more than that, even if it’s not a majority. But the gesture toward “lowering the temperature”, as so many including Lawrence allude to, feels less noble and more businesslike capitulation. Personal politics becomes a choice between allowing people to read between the lines (as Lawrence does) or an outright opacity (like Sweeney’s) that is, ironically, very politician-like. It also fits with an executive mindset that treats audiences more like shareholders than human beings.View image in fullscreenRobert De Niro.Photograph: NBC/Rosalind O’Connor/Getty ImagesAs little as celebrity advocacy tends to move the needle on broad political decisions, and likely more effectively moved toward particular issues rather than tilting at the windmills erected by specific politicians, it’s also cathartic to see which folks aren’t backing down. It is telling, too, that some of the most outspoken figures are those closer to Trump’s advanced age.Harrison Ford, for example, had no compunction abouttelling the Guardianthat he considers Trump one of history’s biggest criminals.Robert De Nirohasgonefurtheras an anti-Trump spokesperson, recently noting that he was “very happy” to see so manymobilizing againstTrump at recentNo Kings protests, and repeatedly bringing up his concern that Trump will not abide by the legal term limits on his presidency: “We cannot let up because he is not going to leave the White House. Anybody who thinks, ‘Oh, he’ll do this, he’ll do that,’ is just deluding themselves.”Does anyone need to hear this alarm sounded by De Niro in particular? Probably not, and surely some former fans will dismiss him as an anti-Trump crank. But at 82, the actor is too late in his career to spend much time calculating what is best for business, which also inures him from charges of empty virtue-signaling. He is clearly saying this stuff because he fully believes it. It’s not that De Niro needs Lawrence, Sweeney or whoever else to stand alongside him, but for all the strangeness of a legendary actor reinventing himself as a cable-news staple, it does seem like De Niro better understands his fellow baby boomer New Yorker. He especially seems to get that Trump is a poisonously ironic figure to inspire this kind of celebrity silence.This president is himself a celebrity first, a corrupt politician second, and an actual political strategist in a distant and possibly accidental third. He may well survey his presidency and secretly conclude that his greatest triumph was asserting that celebrity over others – to get away with literally telling people how to think and how to vote (or maybe in the future, that voting is no longer necessary) while cowing others from expressing their opinions on the matter. If celebrities had no political sway at all, Trump would be doddering and leering his way around a TV studio. Lawrence and Sweeney are right to aspire toward their work saying more than they do – but maybe not for the reasons they think. Celebrity without art is what gets youDonald Trumpin the first place. For this administration, it’s not the singing that’s important; it’s the shutting up.Explore more on these topicsCultureUS politicsJennifer LawrenceRobert De NiroSydney SweeneyGeorge ClooneyHarrison FordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But on the ground in Sierra Leone, the latest betrayal was not unexpectedByMara Kardas-NelsonTue 4 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 00.19 ESTShareEarlier this year, Donald Trump appointed a 28-year-old Doge alumnus, Jeremy Lewin, to oversee his administration’s approach to global aid. Lewin’s primary task has been to gut the US’s aid funding. In an interview withthe New York Times, Lewin argued that the traditional approach, which he termed the “global humanitarian complex”, didn’t help poor countries “progress beyond aid”, instead keeping them dependent. The system, he continued, has “demonstrably failed”.This isn’t just the Trump administration’s view. For decades, there has been a robust debate in academic and policy circles, discussed over drinks by development practitioners, written about by critical economists and postcolonial independence leaders, and percolating into the broader consciousness, that aid isn’t working, or at least not as promised. When the news of Trump’s USAID cuts broke this year, PresidentHakainde Hichilema of Zambiatold the Financial Times that cuts in aid were “long overdue” and would force countries such as his to “take care of our own affairs”.This spring, a few weeks after the Trump administration began dismantling USAID, I visited the small west African nation ofSierra Leone. I had worked there as a global health practitioner from 2015 to 2018, and in the years since I had returned often, this time as a journalist. The more I visited, the more I wondered about the effectiveness of foreign consultants deploying technocratic approaches to entrenched poverty. Not long before my spring visit, I had published a book about microfinance, once hailed as a solution to world poverty, but which I had begun to see as deeply problematic.Despite these reservations, I knew that suddenly cutting off US funding would have huge – and in many places disastrous – consequences. In the months since USAID has been slashed, there have been reports ofchildren starving in Myanmarand pregnant women unable to getantenatal care in Malawi, among many bleak examples.One studysuggests that 14 million people could die because of the aid cuts.Reading these reports, I worried about my friends and former colleagues in Sierra Leone. Would they be able to get their medicines? Would they be able to access a doctor when they needed one? Would panic have set in, the way so many of us felt panicked in the US?What I found on my visit was different. Talking to friends and colleagues, the feeling they most often expressed was not panic but resignation. All of the Sierra Leoneans I spoke to – from mango sellers and electricians to health workers and senior politicians – expressed fear and uncertainty about the cuts. But they also framed the precarity of their situation as normal, even predictable. The potential catastrophes – a shortage of HIV drugs, or vaccines – were mentioned with a flippant, what-do-you-expect shrug.One NGO driver I spoke to, who worked for a US organisation, had lost his job when the cuts were first announced in January 2025, then regained it when some funding began to flow again in April. This kind of stop-start aid didn’t surprise him. He had first become a driver for an NGO in 2014, when the world’s largest Ebola outbreak hit westAfrica. Hundreds of millions of dollars were pledged by foreign donors to stop the virus, and foreign NGOs went on a hiring spree. In the years since, he had seen many of his colleagues let go as the money dried up and NGOs contracted or closed up shop entirely. Why should he expect anything different?Mustapha Kabba, the deputy chief medical officer at Sierra Leone’s ministry of health and sanitation, told me that he couldn’t be too worried about the cuts because he didn’t actually know how much money the US government gave to Sierra Leone: the funding was so byzantine, funnelled through so many different NGOs, each with their own budget and timeline and priorities, that he didn’t have a comprehensive picture of what would be affected and therefore which gaps he’d have to fill.There was one person I was eager to speak to in order to better understand the quiet sufferance I encountered. David Kpakiwa was born in 1961, the year his country gained independence from Britain, and the year John F Kennedy launched USAID and the Peace Corps. David’s life, and his country’s life, had been mapped on to the history of modern aid. He met early Peace Corps volunteers, watched as they became government consultants, then saw a wave of foreigners intervene during Sierra Leone’s civil war, which lasted from 1991 to 2002, before a different set of foreigners turned up to help during theEbolacrisis in 2014.I first met David while on a trip to the eastern part of the country, where he lives, in 2016. It was the weekend, and we went for a long walk on the outskirts of the town of Koidu, in Kono district, a place known for its diamonds but which I was learning to love for its rainforest and its rocky hills. David and I connected immediately. We both find solace in wandering for hours on meandering roads. I felt as if David saw through me. Not in an unkind way, but as if he saw something I didn’t. When I told him I was part of a group of people trying to make Sierra Leone’s health system stronger, he said a group of people had come to do the same thing after the civil war ended. He observed that the same promises, sometimes even the same projects, had been offered and withdrawn, and then offered again.David is not unusual, not a hero figure saving lives or a politician navigating this complicated aid system. He is a farmer and a gardener, often unemployed. He has never worked for an NGO. It is exactly his outsider status that made me want to hear his perspective. I wondered: what does someone like this, who has observed various forms of aid his whole life but whose life has not been dramatically altered by it, make of the apparent end of aid as we know it?When I first met David, I had been in Sierra Leone for about a year, at the end of the Ebola outbreak in which more than 14,000 Sierra Leoneans were infected and nearly 4,000 died. At the height of the crisis, hundreds of millions of dollars of aid were poured into the country’s health system in a matter of months, to help stop the spread of the virus and treat those infected.I was part of a small army of policy consultants who had been hired to help the health system “build back better” to ensure it was robust enough that this would never happen again. I had worked in global health before, primarily in HIV and TB advocacy and policy. I had experience in Africa – but primarily in South Africa, a country thousands of miles away and wildly different in its history, economy, cultural context and health system. Still, I felt deeply committed, moved by the devastation I saw all around me. I was angered by the fact that Ebola had spread so fast – in large part because for decades the country’s health system had suffered from underinvestment by its own government, corporations who had mined the country’s diamond fields, its former colonial power, Britain, and foreign donors.In my first few weeks in the country, I met dozens of other foreigners at government and NGO offices around Freetown, the capital. Almost all were young, upbeat and overworked, furiously drafting policies that were intended to change the lives of millions of Sierra Leoneans. Some of these people were paid, in part, byUSAID. The plans they drew up were at once specific, ambitious, diffuse. Within a matter of months, we were meant to figure out how to help the country’s agriculture sector recover, re-invigorate tourism and “strengthen government, justice and security”. Basically: fix Sierra Leone.View image in fullscreenNurses in Sierra Leone receiving Ebola PPE training from a WHO medic in 2014.Photograph: Michael Duff/APOne evening a few months into my stay, I was invited to a planning session at a consultant’s home, a gated white house with gleaming floors and new leather couches. On behalf of Sierra Leone’s government, a small group of us were to outline, in just a few hours, a city-wide programme that would be paid for by foreign donors and be endorsed by the highest levels of the ministry of health. The programme would start the next day.Food was ordered and champagne opened to help us get through the night. On a personal level, I liked my colleagues. They were hard-working and seemed to genuinely care about creating a better healthcare system. Still, I had an out-of-body feeling for much of the evening, thinking: a group of five foreign people, drinking champagne and sketching, on a white board, a plan for Sierra Leone’s ministry of health? This can’t be right.There were other things that made me uncomfortable. I found it strange that, as a foreign worker, three meals a day were cooked for me and I had access to a driver 24/7. I was housed in an apartment with a balcony, from which I could see the Atlantic Ocean. I made about 80 times what some of my local counterparts did.I was thrilled to be in Sierra Leone. I desperately wanted to help. But as the months ticked by, it became increasingly clear I had little idea what I was doing.David met his first white person in primary school in the late 1960s. Although Sierra Leone had become independent from Britain nearly 10 years earlier, British teachers, administrators and managers still dominated the country’s schools. David was a bright student. He came from a family that had political clout in eastern Sierra Leone and, as one of the eldest sons, was expected to become learned and respected, too.Early in his schooling, David was sent to Koidu, his district’s largest town, where he would receive the best education from these foreign educators. From a young age, his teachers praised him. He liked their stories and their books, but he wondered why they insisted on bringing so much of their lifestyle with them to west Africa. He also struggled to tell the white people apart: which ones were there to educate, which to mine the country’s diamonds.So far as he could tell, all of the white people – teachers and miners alike, along with their wives and children – spent their weekends together on golf courses they had made by clearing out paddy fields, cassava farms and forests, or at a swimming pool at the “club house”, which also had a billiard room, tennis courts, squash courts and a library, and hosted weekly movie nights. “They called Koidu something like ‘Little Paris’ during this time,” said David. It was the height of the country’s diamond boom, and the district accounted for nearly 70% of the country’s gems. The small city “had almost all the facilities you would think that any big city would have”.It was in secondary school when David noticed that, at lunch, the containers holding oil and bulgur for “school feeding” programmes were stamped with the USAID logo. When establishing the agency in 1961, Kennedy had hailed a “historic opportunity for a major economic assistance effort by the free industrialised nations”. The aim was to promote growth in less developed countries and to bring about the day when they “will no longer have to depend on outside assistance”.This was the height of the cold war, when newly independent countries across the developing world were considering whether to align with the Soviet Union or the US. In this struggle, USAID was an instrument of soft power. Radio shows, educational programmes, agricultural training and food distribution would demonstrate the benevolence of the US and the power of its free market.View image in fullscreenDavid Kpakiwa near a health project in Koidu Town.Photograph: Saidu Bah/The GuardianIn its first decade, USAID focused on large infrastructure projects meant to spur development: dams, roads, industrial farming. Almost immediately, there were criticisms: that dams flooded nearby communities and degraded the local environment, that poor local farmers were being displaced by hi-tech farms USAID was promoting. Many of the programmes were funded by loans, not grants, meaning poor governments were on the hook for projects that often didn’t show much evidence of success. African and Latin American leaders voiced their concern about what they saw as a new form of colonialism, and what it would do to their newly independent countries.So American aid changed. By the time David came across USAID lunch rations in the 1970s, the agency had shifted away from big-ticket, state-level programmes towards a “basic needs” approach that targeted the individual through nutritional assistance, education and healthcare. Such grassroots, community-based efforts would be supported by the Peace Corps, also set up by JFK. The programme would send Americans overseas for two years to support “the great common task of bringing to man that decent way of life which is the foundation of freedom and a condition of peace”, Kennedy proclaimed. He envisaged that the corps would demonstrate to the world the goodness of the US. But he also wanted young Americans to learn about the world. Corps members would be volunteers, not government employees. They were expected to eat local food, learn the language. Thousands of idealistic young Americans signed up.On school holidays, when he went back to his village, David began to notice unwashed young Americans hanging out with his friends and family. Most wore loose fitting clothing, or sometimes African prints. They wandered around, going to different villages, where they would cook and eat with Sierra Leoneans, take forest walks, play with children. “They tried to live a simple life, make friends, learn [local] ways of life,” David remembers. “They advised our people, but they learned a lot from our people, also.”As a game, David and his friends would get themselves very dirty, rolling around in the dust, “and then we’d say, ‘Hey, we’re doing Peace Corps style!’” Some of the Americans gave David their old novels. Others paid the school fees of local kids, helped them with their lessons and gave them extra food. But beyond long walks and lazy days reading, “I couldn’t figure out what they were actually doing,” David recalls. “They didn’t seem to be too busy.”Even though JFK had pledged to send men and women qualified to carry out specific jobs, the volunteers David met “were just doing small things. Not what really needed to be done. Their effort wasn’t even going to begin to tackle the problem [of poverty]. We didn’t understand what they were actually bringing us.”David was not alone in his observation. One Peace Corps director,reflecting afterwards onthe work of the agency in the 1960s, noted that “projects throughout the world were not sufficiently oriented to the immediate needs of the country”. In 1967, the director wrote, Pakistan decided not to request additional volunteers because it “determined that its needs were for technicians and specialists of a more sophisticated level than the Peace Corps generally provides”.Despite his early educational aptitude, David was forced to drop out of school at 16 when his father became a prominent figure in the opposition party in the eastern region, and as such found himself shut out of jobs and contracts. David moved back home to his village, where he became bored and restless. In the 1980s, looking for new opportunities, he moved to neighbouring Liberia with his brother. There, he met a Peace Corps volunteer I’ll call Duncan.David had heard of Duncan even before he met him. Everyone knew about Duncan, it seemed. Legend had it that Duncan loved Liberia so much that he served for two Peace Corps terms, then decided to stay, setting up life in a village. Duncan married two African women, fathered seven children, and was a missionary who translated the Bible into Gbandi. In his village, Duncan “was like a king, he was like a god, his word was like law in the area”, David said. “He made sure the people there had hydroelectricity in their small community.”David was going through a rough patch when he met Duncan. In exchange for tutoring his kids, Duncan let David live with him for a while. They ate dinner together every night. To this day, David remains touched that Duncan made a point of never starting without him. During these meals, David watched as Peace Corps volunteers new to the country sought Duncan’s advice. Duncan had begun to work with the Liberian government, although David was not sure in what capacity: “the ministry of local government or something like that, even though he was a white man”. David said he was paid by the US government. (From 1962 to 1980,Liberia received the most US aidper capita of any African country.)David’s time with Duncan coincided with his own internal political awakening. He embraced the anti-colonial, Pan-Africanist ideology that dominated Africa and the Caribbean throughout this period. Then in his 20s, David would sing along to Bob Marley’s Zimbabwe while walking, or doing chores: “Every man got a right to decide his own destiny / And in this judgment there is no partiality / So arm in arms, with arms, we’ll fight this little struggle …” David wondered whether foreign influence, such as the Peace Corps volunteers and Duncan’s role in a government with strong ties to the US, was a continuation of colonialism under a different guise.View image in fullscreenA USAID billboard in Koidu Town, Sierra Leone.Photograph: Saidu Bah/The GuardianIn December 1989, Charles Taylor, a Liberian political figure who had been educated in the US, invaded Liberia from the Ivory Coast in order to overthrow the government. After fighting reached the streets of Monrovia, David made his way back to Sierra Leone. But the war followed him. In 1991,with support from Taylor, a rebel group tried to topple Sierra Leone’s president, kicking off a decade-long civil war. The conflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia were largely funded by the diamond trade. David’s home of Kono was a diamond mining district, and it brought violence to the area. He left his home again, moving west this time, to the capital, Freetown.As the conflict dragged on, David started seeing different foreigners coming to the country: more people involved in the military and mining, fewer young people coming to live languorous lives in “the bush”.Foreigners intervened sporadically in the conflict. In 1994-5, the government hired aprivate army run by a South African security firm, with the extraordinary name Executive Outcomes. The group had contracts with the mining industry in Kono and was initially hired to capture diamond mines from the rebels. According to Sierra Leone’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, an IMF loan was used to pay Executive Outcomes.The government also deployed achaotic forceof west African troops from various countries against the rebels, nearly 12,000 strong and staffed largely by Nigerians. Reports of horrendous atrocities against civilians, primarily by rebels but also the army, got the world’s attention. There had been widespread reporting of the horrors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, after the UN and other forces had been woefully slow to react. By 1997, Sierra Leone receivedthe largest UN peacekeeping forcein existence at the time, made up of Russians, British, Nepalis, Ghanaians, Germans, Jordanians and others. In 2000,British troopsarrived to reinforce the UN and government forces.It was hard for David to tell what motivated these various players, or even to understand what it was they were doing or whom they answered to. Foreign soldiers would be in the streets of Freetown one day, then gone the next. Who was in charge of them? They were meant to be fighting the rebels, but Human Rights Watchreported that someof the Nigerian soldiers allegedly killed women and children, too. In Freetown, David regularly saw violence perpetrated by fighters affiliated with all sides of the conflict. Where did they get their weapons? Their food? The conflict seemed connected to a network of powerful people far beyond Sierra Leone. He became distrustful of everyone he met, journalist or aid worker, sure that “one way or the other they were mercenaries”.The war officially ended in early 2002. A new government promised reconciliation, justice, accountability. The end of the conflict ushered in grand promises of global aid, including the launch of policies to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, and achieve universal primary education within 15 years. The international community pledgedhundreds of millions of dollarsto rebuild Sierra Leone. Foreign consultants, military experts, doctors, lawyers and engineers would help reform the government, courts, education and healthcare.David saw dozens of new NGOs and initiatives spring up. Training schemes for farmers and empowerment programmes for women, new schools for orphans and settlements for people whose arms or hands had been cut off by the rebels. Houses were erected, community halls built, water pumps installed. The scale and ambition were dizzying. At times, the projects were disjointed and ill-planned, and there was little oversight. “Just after the war, there were a lot of [NGO] projects that did not do anything for anyone,” Ibrahim Tommy, executive director of Sierra Leone’s Centre for Accountability and the Rule of Lawtold the UN news servicein 2014. “Donors just wanted to fund anything that made them sound like they were involved in Sierra Leone. There was that period of madness.” By 2009,according to a government report, aid made up 18% of the country’s GDP.After the war, David moved back to Kono. He set up a small homestead on his family’s land on the outskirts of the district’s main city, not far from a new town created for amputees. The NGO that erected it built a concrete structure, installed an outdoor gym and sunk a borehole to signify the founding of a village; positive moves, although the population still lived in poverty. Down the road, David surrounded his farm with tropical flowers.One day in 2012, David walked by a spot selling palm wine and heard an American accent. A foreign man was trying to chat to some locals over drinks, but it wasn’t easy, since he could not speak Krio, the country’s main language. David stopped at the bar and interpreted for a bit. He learned the man was an anthropology professor from a US university. David invited the professor to his place to talk more.View image in fullscreenThe Single Leg Amputee Sports Association football team, which was created at the end of the civil war in Sierra Leone in 2002.Photograph: John Wessels/AFP/Getty ImagesDavid was pleased that the professor seemed impressed by the flowers he had grown. He learned that soon the man’s students would be coming to Sierra Leone. Interest in global health was at its peak, and after effective Aids treatment programmes were established – such as the Global Fund and the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, or Pepfar – many NGOs began using aid money to support affiliated health programmes: not just HIV testing and treatment, but building new hospitals, caring for pregnant women and newborns, and trying to strengthen health systems more broadly. By 2010, foreign aid was funding millions of healthcare workers and researchers, at least in part, and HIV was no longer a death sentence. In this moment of optimism, many of the world’s top universities, particularly those in the US and UK, set up global health programmes.David learned that the professor’s students would be coming to help at a struggling clinic half an hour’s walk from his house. The clinic was hoping to tap into this vast global funding apparatus to expand into treating HIV and malaria and improving maternal and child health.When the students arrived, they gravitated towards David’s place. In the evenings, he brewed “jamba tea”, made of weak marijuana stalks, and cooked dinner while they talked on the front porch. David thought they were smart and perceptive. He enjoyed explaining Sierra Leone to the kids. He wanted them to understand its complicated history and local customs – whom to greet when first entering a village, the importance of showing respect. Now in his 50s, David was the one holding court. His warmth towards these young people coincided with him rethinking the harsh way he had viewed the “unwashed” Peace Corps volunteers from years before. He remained unsure of their usefulness, but he was moved to hear that several former volunteers had set up an organisation to support some families in Kono, such as paying school fees, decades after they had left Sierra Leone.David spent several summers with these students. Then, in mid-2014, one told him he had heard news of a virus breaking out in nearby Guinea. They were anxious that since Kono bordered Guinea it might spread there, too. Soon, it did. People started showing up in clinics and hospitals with high fevers and severe diarrhoea, vomiting blood. The local health system was quickly overwhelmed. Sierra Leonean clinicians cared for patients as best they could, offering water to rehydrate and painkillers for fever. Some, fearful, refused to work at all. Patients filled hospital corridors, where some died. People began to avoid health centres, since it seemed you had about as good a chance of dying there as dying at home. The disease spread; soon, thousands across the country were infected.A few months into the outbreak, foreign medical teams arrived, bringing much-needed supplies, expertise and personnel. Although extremely deadly, Ebola is not especially complicated to treat. It requires a clean environment, lots of rehydration, isolation and careful monitoring over time. The foreigners set up treatment centres with beds, needles, IV fluid, gloves – basic things, but things that many Sierra Leonean health centres didn’t have. After several weeks, in Kono, even those on the high risk list – little babies and old grannies – were surviving.Thenearly $1bnspent on fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone went not just on treatment, but also on salaries, apartments and drivers for foreign medical staff, flights, conferences, food, mobile phone bills. Many of the clinicians received hazard pay, to incentivise and reward life-threatening work, and lived in gated compounds, where they had meals cooked for them and comfortable spaces to rest and, if necessary, quarantine.All this made sense on paper: if they were to go abroad and risk their lives, foreign medical workers needed assurances they would be safe. But to Sierra Leoneans observing the influx of foreign workers and the way they lived, it could be hard to draw a line between necessity and excess. David felt shocked when he learned that one foreign worker with whom he had become friendly had saved up so much hazard pay she’d bought a new car back in the US. “They come and take the money and go,” said David. “It’s the same problem with the ones who come in for the minerals and then leave.”David was not alone in viewing the foreign aid workers with some mistrust. According toone study, “scepticism and resistance were widespread”, as some members of the public suspected that “Ebola was a crisis manufactured for external benefit”. In response, national education campaigns, funded by foreign dollars, were launched to encourage people to call a new hotline, use ambulances, trust health workers. Military-style “mop up campaigns”, encouraged by the UN and some foreign NGOs, swept communities, identifying sick people and bringing them in for treatment. The campaign was effective in reducing the transmission rate. It could also be scary: soldiers manning checkpoints and yelling at market women felt far too reminiscent of the civil war.Then, as Ebola drifted into memory, foreigners left, as did much of their money. Within a matter of months, Sierra Leone’s foreignaid halved. A few years later, as David and I were taking a ride around Freetown in apoda-poda, a public minibus, we heard fellow passengers half-joking that, as the economy worsened, the country needed “another Ebola” if money was ever going to flow like that again. David looked at me and shrugged.In the years since I first met David, he’s begun a relationship and had two children. We speak weekly, by WhatsApp, about the world, the books we’re reading, our lives. When I visit him in Sierra Leone, we always try to go to the beach, a place of calm and reflection for both of us.During my visit this spring, David and I found ourselves again on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, on Freetown’s peninsula, the city’s green hills bordering our view. It was a perfect day: crisp, bright, blue. It happened to be the 64th anniversary of the country’s independence. David lit up a joint, blew out some smoke, coughed, then mused: “It just crossed my mind, if you’re dependent too much, you’re not going to be happy. We’re still very much in-dependence. So, we can’t really be happy.”David is not a Trump fan, but he told me that he is not against the idea of a global aid shake-up. “Sometimes I think, we’ve tried those old ways,” he said. “I don’t think that I’ve really seen anything [in my life] that’s made any difference. If anything, it’s just gotten worse.” But, he continued, “we can learn from those things and see how we have to change. We have to learn why these other people failed, you know?”Whether the Trump administration is truly interested in learning from past failures is another matter. Listening to the New York Times interview with Lewin, I thought of a conversation I had recently had with a source for an article about the Trump administration’s restrictions on federal student loans. We talked about how ironic it was that people like her, who had been sounding the alarm about rising student debt, were now concerned that Trump would make getting loans harder. On its face, Trump’s policy seemed to address her concerns: if there was too much debt, then limit lending. But, she continued, in every executive order she had read, the administration would have one sentence correctly identifying the problem, followed by a “batshit crazy solution”. The solution isn’t to restrict loans. It’s to fix the way higher education is funded.Haiti and the failed promise of US aidRead moreSomething similar applies to aid. It is reasonable to say that the global approach to humanitarian aid needs to change. But abruptly ending projects that sustain lives and upending economies that have, over decades, become dependent on aid is so far from a solution that it undermines any part of the analysis that might be correct.At what may be the end of a grand experiment in global aid, David, now in his 60s, is used to its ebbs and flows. He seems to be watching the current slashing of contributions with a sort of distant calm, the way one may absent-mindedly watch the tide going in and out: you don’t have to follow too closely, because you already know the pattern.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readUSAIDSierra LeoneAfricaDonald TrumpEbolafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is there anyone outside Planet Rachel who couldn’t see that truth two years ago?Tue 4 Nov 2025 08.42 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 15.24 ESTShareThis would actually have been quite an understandable day for Rachel Reeves tocry at work. “I’m really clear,” the chancellor told the CBI less than a year ago, “I’m not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes.” Can I shock you …? “We did wipe the slate clean,” she continued less than 12 months ago. “[We] put public finances and public services on a firm footing, and as a result we won’t have to do a budget like thisever again.” Again: can I shock you …?So, then, to Reeves’s podium appearancefrom Downing Street this morning. Vibes-wise, it was like knowing you were going to be very incompetently mugged in three weeks’ time, but having to listen to a speech from the mugger about the context of it all. Or maybe a speech from an asteroid trying to get out in front of what people are going to say about it when it craters the West Midlands.Reeves’s delivery is more wooden than the panelling behind her today, and has all the verve of being informed that we’re experiencing higher than normal call volumes. Your estimated wait time to the budget is 22 days. There were moments in this outing where it felt like the chancellor’s job had already been automated. She must have been absolutely unplayable on the complaints line at HBOS.Anyhow, please listen carefully as her menu options have recently changed. “The world has thrown even more challenges our way,” Reeves explained, with the air of someone who spent the four months between the general election victory and her first budget last autumn telling everyone how utterly abysmal the situation was, and then being blindsided by the collapse in consumer,businessandinvestor confidence, and a desperately unhelpful economic climate of foreboding about what was to come. Luckily Reeves had a cunning plan up her sleeve back then:raising employers’ national insurancecontributions, which took care of any last remaining traces of optimism.Yet once again this morning, the government was opting to serve as Cassandra for its own forthcoming fiscal event. Maybe because it went so well last time. Having absolutely sworn before the election that there were “no ifs, no ands, no buts” to her tax pledges, Reeves today really wanted to introduce you to Mr If, Miss And and President But. We just need Mrs Fully Costed to complete the set.A lot of things seemed to have eaten Reeves’s homework, but one of the biggest bites was apparently taken by budget watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR’s decisionto downgradeits productivity forecasts for the economy was treated as a serious curveball, as opposed to an arguably belatedly realistic engagement with the facts. For someone who spent half this speech and the Q&A after it announcing that she had to deal with “the world as I find it”, Reeves certainly gave the impression that she could dismiss gravity or the first law of thermodynamics as just an opinion by some unelected physics.Another of the challenges the world seems to have thrown her way is the discovery that you cannot get a single spending cut through the parliamentaryLabourparty. Again, if only there’d been signs. Reeves didn’t put it that way, obviously. She said she didn’t think it was fair “to blame the parliamentary Labour party for the OBR’s supply-side review”. And I don’t think it’s fair that a good half of the parliamentary Labour party would not have the first clue what the words “supply-side” even mean. So we’re all having to live with injustice.Other omissions? It was disappointing that no one asked the chancellor if she defines herself as a “working person”, one of that mythical tribe on whom taxes were never, ever, ever going to be raised. Last week, Sam Coates at Skygot hold of the definitionof “working people” that the Treasury is supposedly working around ahead of the budget later this month, which is apparently the bottom two-thirds of earners – which is to say, no one earning more that £45,000 a year. “Extraordinary if true,” the former IFS director Paul Johnsonobserved drily. But aspirational, surely, for many experienced plumbers and train drivers to learn that they are no longer working people, and have passed with immediate effect into Labour’s upper category: those with the broadest shoulders/the privileged few/fat cats. Under this definition, a chancellor definitely isn’t a working person, even though Rachel is always telling you she’s working tirelessly to do this or that for the country.Then again, the chancellor does love a simplistic way of putting things – black holes, fixing house foundations – so here’s one for her. Why does she seem to be catching up only now with things many people told herbefore the last election? Why is the long-term state of the British economy a surprise only to Reeves and to the cadre of full-time dreamers who believed Starmer’s Labour were “the grownups”? As so many made clear before the general election, Labour’s promises on tax and blandishments about growth were totally unrealistic and un-thought-through. In fact, they were such obvious obfuscations or deliberate misdirections that for my money they amounted to lying. Can it genuinely be that the chancellor didn’t catch herself on to the glaring realities of “the books” – which are effectively always open, as the IFSpointed out at the time? No, it can’t. As she put it about the details of the public finances during the run-up to last year’s election: “We’ve got the Office for Budget Responsibility now … You don’t need to win an election to find out.” Halloween might have passed, but huge numbers of these quotes are going to haunt Reeves for the foreseeable future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Clearly, Reeves would love to think otherwise, but it feels already too late for her to be successfully honest. The run-up to a general election it was going to win by a landslide was Labour’s moment to be honest. In terms of its public standing on the economy, almost everything since has flowed from that conscious decision not to level with voters about things it honestly must have known at the time. By way of some speech filler today, Reeves droned vaguely about making the UK an enticing investment for futuristic industries like AI and biotech. No doubt we’re all in favour of that – but for her own personal future, the chancellor would be a lot better off attracting a time machine firm.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistA year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa CrerarOn Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back at another extraordinary year, with special guests, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.

When our very handsome (much better-lookingthan Zohran Mamdani!) and very high-IQ leader Donald Trump gives me a personal shoutout to commend me on what a wonderful job I’m doing. As we all know, a good journalist should always make the rich and powerful feel comfortable.While I wait for that day to come, I’m watching and learning from the head honchos at CBS.Trump appeared on CBS News’s 60 Minuteson Sunday night for his first sit-down with the show in five years and commented on how much better the network has become after its owner, Paramount, was taken over by his billionaire allies, the father-and-son duo Larry and David Ellison.If you watched the interview on TV, you might have missed that particular bit because (weird!) itdidn’t get aired. Nor did the bit where Trump said the network’s new editor-in-chief,Bari Weiss, who according to the FT was picked by David Ellison for herpro-Israel views, was a “great new leader”. Nor did a bit where Trump boasted how “60 Minutes paid me a lotta money,” while referencing his $16m settlement from Paramount for what he called a “deceptively” edited interview with Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes in 2024. Also not fully aired on the TV broadcast: a segment in which the president claimed hedidn’t know a crypto tycoonwho went to prison for breaching money laundering laws, despite the fact that Trump pardoned him. That bit, along with all the others, did appear in thefull text transcriptpublished online.Interviews are edited for length and clarity all the time. But the Trump-friendly editing of an interview conducted by a network now owned by the president’s allies, with a head of news that he thinks is “great”, is part of a broader trend of US media outlets lying down and rolling over for Trump.Look, for example, at all thecorporate donorsthat have rushed to show their fealty to Trump by donating to his extravagant ballroom project. These include Amazon, Apple and Meta, as well as Comcast, which is the parent company of NBCUniversal. Look at Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post, whose editorial board recently published adefence of Trump’s teardownof the White House’s east wing for his ballroom. “Strong leaders reject calcification,” the editorial board wrote. That’s the same Washington Post, of course, thatrefused to publishPulitzer prize winner Ann Telnaes’s cartoon of billionaire Bezos kneeling before Trump.Authoritarians have always sought to control the media. But what’s so terrifying about the current moment isn’t flattering interview edits, it’s the way that Trump and his friends are seeking to edit our relationship with reality. Take Elon Musk, who helped propel Trump to his second term. First Musk bought Twitter – a very convenient way of controlling online discourse – and now he has launched hisown AI-poweredversion of Wikipedia called Grokipedia. “The goal here is to create an open source, comprehensive collection of all knowledge,” Muskposted on Xlast week. “Then place copies of that etched in a stable oxide in orbit, the Moon and Mars to preserve it for the future.”Forget stable oxides – the real goal here, you could argue, is instability; to muddy truth and knowledge so thoroughly that reality itself is up for debate. Grokipedia, I’m sure I don’t need to tell you, is already being found to be riddled with factual errors; largely because it pulls from unreliable sources. “Chatroom contributions are given equal status with serious academic work,” one academictold the Guardian. When you make it difficult to separate opinions from facts, it becomes a lot easier to manipulate people.AI-generated videos take the muddling of reality to a whole new level. Fox News, owned by the Murdoch family, recently reported on videos circulating on social media in which Black food stamp beneficiaries were threatening to ransack stores if the US government shutdown stopped their benefits. There were various clues that the videos were AI-generated racist rage-bait, but Fox ignored all those and presented them as real. Eventually it corrected its story to note the videos were AI-generated, but the lie had already travelled halfway around the world. And no doubt Musk’s Grokipedia will soon etch that lie in a stable oxide in orbit, to preserve it for the future.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskSocial mediaTikTokArtificial intelligence (AI)Jeff BezoscommentShareReuse this content"

Already a music industry veteran at 23, she had spent five years as a member of Southern Comfort, a group of singers regularly employed as backing vocalists at the renowned Fame studios in her native Alabama. But she was rigidly unimpressed with her San Francisco friends’ undying devotion to Jerry Garcia and co. She hated the band’s name and loudly opined that the only reason people liked them was because they were invariably out of their minds on drugs when they went to see them live. In fact, she could prove she was right: she offered to attend a Dead show sober, certain she would hate it.It proved a fateful decision. By the end of the Dead’s set at the Winterland Ballroom, Thatcher – ostensibly retired from music – had announced: “If I sing again, it will be with this band”. Through attending other Dead shows she met a local pianist named Keith Godchaux, whom she subsequently married, and after meeting Garcia and angling for him to give her new husband a job, she found herself hired as well.On one occasion during the Europe ’72 tour, Godchaux took to the stage having taken 15 hits of LSDIt says something about the Grateful Dead’s unique position in American rock that Godchaux’s eight-year tenure with the band came to define her. It wasn’t as if her CV were lacking before she joined. Fame Studios was notoriously spotty when it came to crediting backing vocalists, so no complete record of her performances there exists, but she sang on Elvis Presley’s Suspicious Minds and In the Ghetto; Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman, and Warm and Tender Love; and with Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding and Dionne Warwick among others.Her timing in joining the Dead was fortuitous: their sound had taken a turn for the rootsy with 1970’s Workingman’s Dead and American Beauty – two key texts in the development of what would come to be called Americana – but the band’s usual source of traditionally soulful vocals, the blues-influenced keyboard player Ron “Pigpen” McKernan, was ailing, stricken by the alcoholism that hastened his death in 1973. Steeped in a different musical tradition to the rest of the band, Godchaux’s voice swiftly became part of their sound, as evidenced by her contributions to guitarist Bob Weir’s solo debut Ace – a Dead album in all but name – and Europe ’72, the triple-vinyl live set that documented the band’s visit to the continent in the spring of that year, and a strong contender for the title of greatest Grateful Dead album of all.But Godchaux’s apparently seamless integration into the band wasn’t quite as straightforward as it looked. She was a studio singer rather than a live vocalist, and the nightly high-wire act of the Grateful Dead’s live shows was quite the baptism by fire. Their three-hour-plus gigs were performed without a setlist, with members either calling for songs on stage in the style of jazz musicians at a jam session, or else by steering improvised passages towards the next track on the spot. In addition, it was a high-wire act that, in the early 70s at least, was often performed on acid. On one notable occasion during the Europe ’72 tour, Godchaux took to the stage having taken 15 hits of LSD, unaware that the band’s supply – which had been weakening in strength as the tour progressed – had been replenished with fresh, undiluted provisions. In her account, she spent most of the show lying prone under her husband’s piano, but somehow still made it to the microphone in time to sing.Furthermore, while there were certainly some formidable women within the Dead’s inner circle – including Garcia’s partner Carolyn Adams, audio engineer and producer Betty Cantor-Jackson, and drummer Bill Kreutzmann’s wife Susila, who more or less singlehandedly started the band’s merchandising empire – its core was exclusively male and, as their biographer Dennis McNally tactfully put it, “not a bastion of feminist liberation”. But Godchaux, the only female member of the Grateful Dead during their 30-year history, was clearly made of stern stuff. She seldom took a lead vocal but demurred at the label “backing vocalist”, preferring the term “ensemble singing” – which certainly fits the sound of Godchaux and her band members belting out the choruses of Playing the Band or Eyes of the World en masse.Still, she proved a controversial figure. The culture of fans obsessively taping Grateful Dead shows meant that mistakes as well as transcendent moments were captured for posterity, and the mistakes often involved re-creating complex vocal harmonies on stage. But it seemed hugely unfair that Godchaux’s voice was singled out for criticism given how pitchy the other members could sound. And Godchaux was often magnificent in concert, as the belatedly released live albums One from the Vault or The Closing of Winterland proved.View image in fullscreenShe never really left the band behind … Godchaux performing with Dead & Company in 2016.Photograph: Amy Harris/ShutterstockIn the studio, her voice was unimpeachable. Hear the depth her harmonies bring to Row Jimmy and Stella Blue, two impossibly beautiful ballads from 1973’s Wake of the Flood, the raw soulfulness of her voice on 1975’s The Music Never Stopped or her fantastic contributions to 1977’s slick Terrapin Station. And if you want to venture away from the Grateful Dead per se, her vocals on Palm Sunday and the brief Down Home from the Jerry Garcia Band’s 1978 album Cats Under the Stars are incredible.Keith and Donna Godchaux both left the Grateful Dead after 1978’s patchy Shakedown Street, an album that sounded distinctly coked-out. The couple moved to Alabama to deal with Keith’s worsening drug problem, and he had apparently conquered his addictions when he was killed in a car crash in 1980.Grateful Dead: where to start in their back catalogueRead moreDonna Jean married bass player David MacKay in 1981, becoming Donna Jean Thatcher Godchaux-Mackay, and formed a succession of other bands, but she never really left the Grateful Dead behind. She still performed their songs. Her version of Crazy Fingers is a highlight of the 2014 album she recorded with Jeff Matson, and Matson is a member of the Grateful Dead tribute band the Zen Tricksters, with whom Godchaux also recorded an album. She also happily sat in on stage with the Dark Star Orchestra, a band dedicated to recreating classic Dead shows live, became involved with the unending stream of archival Grateful Dead releases, and occasionally appeared on stage with various former band members.Once a controversial addition, her role in the band seemed to be burnished by the passing of time. Deadheads can argue for hours about which of their lineups was the best, but the Godchaux-bolstered 70s version is always in strong contention. It was something that the band’s official statement about her death seemed to touch on: “Her contributions will forever remain part of the tapestry that continues to be woven.”Explore more on these topicsGrateful DeadPop and rockPsychedeliacommentShareReuse this content"

The chancellor will have to submit her major decisions to her official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), this week. This means no more discussion, debate and seat-switching between No 10 and No 11 – once the spreadsheet is sent it is rarely changed. I hope that it includes an increase in the basic rate of income tax, something we haven’t seen since the 1970s. It is hard to see how else Reeves can navigate the three trials of this budget: fixing the bottom line, supporting growth and distributing the pain fairly.First, the hole in the public finances must be filled. New Resolution Foundation analysis estimates that borrowing is on course to be£14bn higher than it was in March– enough to break her fiscal rules. That’s smaller than some have speculated but still leaves a mountain to climb. And the chancellor will need to do more than match this shortfall – and build a far stronger financial buffer against her fiscal rules – if she is to reassure the markets and avoid coming back for even more tax rises or spending cuts at the next budget. Doing so would be unusual – typically chancellors under-react to bad economic news and overreact to good news. Only one budget in the past 14 years has responded to a worse underlying forecast by more than making up for the deterioration (George Osborne, in 2012).Second, the budget must be pro-growth. The biggest cause of higher borrowing is expected to be the judgment by the OBR that the UK’s post-financial-crisis stagnation will persist. The government is right to try to find policy that might turn this around. But even the OBR’smore pessimistic viewof growth is likely to be better than we’ve seen since the pandemic. So, as the Queen of Hearts said to Alice, the OBR will say to the chancellor: “It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.”Third, the chancellor will have to distribute the pain fairly. Families have barely emerged from a cost of living crisis. Food prices remain high and energy billsare risingjust as the temperature falls. While we no longer have “crisis” levels of inflation, that crisis was scarring and inflation is still high, atalmost double its target rate. So, a budget that lowers rather than stokes inflation is good politics and good economics. With inflation already uncomfortably high, the Bank of England might well respond to tax measures that further increase priceswith higher interest rates, raising the interest payments that both households and the government must make. So forget any increases to VAT at this budget.That leaves the chancellor needing to find around £25bn of tax rises, according to our analysis, and in a way that doesn’t damage investment, and that supports growth.Clearly, increasing income tax can help raise money. On its own, each 1p rise in income taxraises £10bn. Preferably, if income tax was increased 1p while employee national insurance was cut by the same amount, then pay packets would be unaffected, while everyone who doesn’t pay national insurance would see a rise. There are a fair chunk of those people and so substantial sums can still be raised this way.Those who would pay more include pensioners, who should bear some of the cost of this budget. After all, they have been one of the biggest beneficiaries from the increases in public spending. An astonishing £9 in every £10 of the additional day-to-day departmental spending from this Labour governmentwent to the NHS, a public service used disproportionately by older people. Yet pensioners currently pay lower rates of tax on their income than those in work. An income tax rise would only affect those who have enough to pay it. The bumperrise in the basic state pensionnext year would still leave all pensioners on less than £40,000 a year better off, even after a 2p income tax rise. Nor does this unreasonably punish those who saved, as savings into a pension can be made free of income tax.In thinking about the effects of tax rises, we must avoid comparing them to a fantasy world in which no pain is needed. But the economic case against raising income tax – reducing the enthusiasm of employees to earn more – can be mitigated by reducing national insurance at the same time. Landlords would face higher tax bills, but with the total supply of housing unlikely to be affected we should not expect a big change in rents. The tax advantages of self-employment over payrolled employment,now at a record high, would be reduced. Tackling this distortion would be good for growth.We must stop hoping we will magically wake up from the nightmare of a country beleaguered by low growth. There is no cheap route to world-class universal healthcare in an ageing society. It’s time to face reality. None of this is politically easy, and manifesto pledges should not be broken lightly. But an income tax rise would be a response sufficiently serious to meet the moment Britain faces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I spent four weeks lying, cheating and murdering friends and colleagues in our office version of The Traitors.I almost lost my mind.Everyone watches The Traitors and sees the contestants, Traitors and Faithfuls alike, act irrationally and make poor decisions and thinks: “That wouldn’t be me. I’d be rational. I wouldn’t beLinda from series three, immediately giving the game away. I’d be Harry from series two,emotionally manipulatinga girl with a colostomy bag.”Reader, I was once like you. I was so certain of my rationality that on New Year’s Day Itweeted my confidenceI would be “extremely normal” if I were ever on the show.Little did I know that one of my colleagues was donning metaphorical eyeliner and fringe to act as Claudia Winkleman. Just a week later, I received a Slack explaining that three of my colleagues and I had been selected as Traitors in a game in my office. I’m not sure why God chose this example to teach me a lesson about being careful what you wish for. Or was it about pride? I’m just glad the stakes were so low. And maybe his message should have been clearer.The rules were simple. Everyone in the office had been made either a Faithful or a Traitor. In the morning, the Traitors’ latest victim would be announced on Slack. In the evening, we’d vote on who we wanted to banish. If there were any Traitors left at the end of the game, the Traitors would win the grand prize, a day of annual leave. On paper, it all seems like a low-stakes team-building exercise. No one was competing so they could afford a bionic hand, asNicky did in season one. And I’m sure the colleague who donned the metaphorical eyeliner as our Claudia didn’t intend to induceMcCarthy-level paranoiain me. But she did.I left the Slack channel we were in at once. The idea of forming a brand-new group called “Project costs”, with four people from entirely different parts of the business, seemed too suspicious to me. We moved to a WhatsApp group, our digital turret. It was easier than trying to have hooded meetings in the supply cupboard after work.We called the group “Nan’s birthday” so that it could be open on our work laptops without attracting suspicion. To make it seem more authentic, I made the group photo an actual photo of my nanna at her 90th birthday. Only when I’d saved my fellow Traitors’ numbers under fake names was I happy that the digital level of OpSec was high enough.In person, it was a different story. We were subjected to a 24/7, cross-platform interrogation. WhatsApps, pitch meetings, client lunches – all became accusatory terrain. Lying became second nature. I lied to colleagues as I warmed up my lunch in the microwave, I lied at work drinks, I even lied to my manager who worked in a different office, and wasn’t even playing the game.I spoke about almost nothing else. I’d wake my girlfriend up, boring her stupid about what Faithfuls had which theories, and who had nearly been caught, and who we were going to murder next. I dreamed about it.There was a farcical moment where I discussed the game with some colleagues on my PoliticsJOE podcast. Through gritted teeth, I claimed to be a Faithful. Now I wasn’t just lying to people I knew. Ifelt like Richard Nixon.On the way up to Manchester with two Faithful colleagues, we didn’t talk about anything apart from who we thought were Traitors and Faithfuls. We turned the spotlight on one another, each subjected to about 45 minutes of scrutiny. After my turn, my colleagues looked at each other.“You’d have to be some sort of psychopath to be able to lie like that,” one said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

D is severely mentally ill and – this is the not-bad bit – everyone at universal credit is incredibly helpful and understanding about who they’re dealing with. They respect his privacy and take the time to make sure P and I are authorised to help, while not erecting needless barriers around talking to us. They’ll sit on the phone listening to all three of us bicker, they’ll put up with P absolutely refusing to be known by her given name, even though that’s the one on all her bank accounts. They are nice.The online forms are very plainly written, except for odd bits of language. There are stark warnings about losing all your benefits with a wrong answer, which is needlessly stressful. You wouldn’t do that on a GCSE. There are unnecessary cliffhangers, such as “Have you been out of the UK in the past two years?” – you have to click “yes” even if it’s just a day trip to Calais, with no way of knowing whether the next page will say, “Wrong answer, chum, you are no longer entitled to anything.” (In fact the next page is full of modifiers, such as “for less than two weeks”, and everything is fine.)They talk constantly about “migrating” to universal credit; the necessity of migrating in a timely manner; the dire consequences of non-migration. But this is a pretty loaded word now, so after a couple of hours of this, D was asking whether he was going to get sent to Rwanda, and yes, initially he was joking, but once the anxiety had planted itself, he wasn’t.Find me anyone with a severe mental illness in which one of the components is not anxiety. Find me anyone who relies on benefits of any kind, after the past 15 years of random acts of political vandalism, media demonisation, and one lot pandering to another lot with tough talk, who isn’t made anxious enough already by any interaction, without the language of yet another demonised out-group getting thrown into the mix.It’s made bearable by the people on the end of the phone, but it shouldn’t have to skate so close to unbearable in the first place.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now we’re letting Moscow beat us at our own gameJoseph PearsonThe Berlin airlift was a cold war victory that relied on a persuasive story about starving civilians. But was it true?Tue 4 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 11.57 ESTShareWe in the west used to play dirty – and during the cold war, we were good at it. Nowadays, we leave grey-zone tactics and hybrid warfare to Russia, which is winning the disinformation war. Europe’s pride in playing by the rules might just be democracy’s achilles heel.The Berlin airlift is a good example ofwhat we once did well– and have since forgotten. The cold war arguably began and ended in Berlin, bookended by the 1948-9 airlift and the fall of the wall in 1989. The former was the largest air reliefoperation in history. It supplied Berlin when Stalin tried to force out the western allies. In parallel, the west used radio (RIAS, or Radio in the American Sector, a precursor tothe CIA-fundedRadio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty), and strengthened soft power with cultural missions such as the British-stagedShakespeare in the rubble, and education through American-runlibraries and courses.The biggest western tool, however, was disinformation. The allied airlift cost the equivalent ofalmost $3bn today, and needed a persuasive narrative to win public support. It’s one that almost everyone still believes today: Berlin was blockaded, its land routes sealed, and women and children were starving.Except, while there was an airlift of supplies, there was no Berlin blockade.In the National Archives at Kew, I found documents from 1948 showing, in the Foreign Office’s words, “the blockade of Berlin is NOT a siege” and that “movement in and out of Germans is possible all the time”, for example to obtain food. A press campaign, however, pushed for “a massive and sensational story of air power applied to humanitarian ends”. The US secretary of state, George C Marshall,argued via telegramto “utilize to the utmost present propaganda advantage our position”, “stressing [Soviet] responsibility for … threatened starvation of civilian population”. The story was so effective, it became a cold war myth that stuck. In the UK, teenagers stilllearn for their GCSEsthat Berlin was blockaded by Stalin and risked starvation.Was it right to mislead the public in 1948 and 1949? No. Did it win full support in the UK and US? Yes. The airlift even won Harry Truman an unexpectedre-election that November.What have we learned – and unlearned – since then? European democracies pride themselves on being more truthful than the Russians (and the US). The integrity of information – transparency, facts, and evidence – builds trust.Western media need to be better than rumour mills and bots. And what’s happening inRussiais bad enough without embellishment.Our tactics, however, could be tougher. We are losing the information war to Russia because tools we relied on during the cold war – many from the time of the airlift–are dying quiet deaths. Radio and news agencies set up to broadcast to eastern Europe are in the crosshairs: Trumptried to killRFE and Radio Liberty. UK ministers are rightly accused of being “asleep at the wheel”, with the threats to soft-power funding, such as to the British Council. The German counterpart in cultural diplomacy, theGoethe Institut, is being stripped of funds.In the US, the Global Engagement Center,set up in 2016 to expose disinformation,was shut downby Trump earlier this year.EU counterparts, such as theEuropean External Action Service(EEAS) and theEast StratCom Task Force, focus more on monitoring threats than taking offensive action. As the Royal United Services Institutewarns, the west has failed “to come up with a meaningful response or strengthen its public outreach …to counter Russian disinformation efforts.”Because Russia is winning hearts and minds, not just in Europe but also in theglobal south. Troll factories, cyber-attacks,deepfakes, and fake news campaigns – aboutdirty bombs and bioweaponsbeing developed in Ukraine, for example – tip public opinion in regions where the west has lost its moral high ground. Putin calls the west’s tactics a “dangerous, bloody, and dirty game”,but he’s projecting. It’s the game he’s playing.View image in fullscreenA Russian MIG-31 fighter jet flying above the Baltic sea after violating Estonian air space in September 2025Photograph: FORSVARSMAKTEN/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat would playing dirty look like? It would mean acting with the same zeal and guts that helped the west stand up to Stalin – and win. It would mean decisive action on the same lines as the EU’s 2022suspension of Russian propaganda broadcasters, RT and Sputnik, and the US Cyber Command’s 2018attack on a Russian troll factory, the Internet Research Agency, in order to stop midterm election interference. It would mean engaging hacktivists – because we rarely hear about western cyber victories against Russia – although this may be because they make “less noise”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But as Russia sends outmenace drones, testing Europe’s borders, we spend our time worrying rather than pushing back.What we’ve lost most since the airlift, when the US and UK poured into Europe money, information power, and military might for the first time in peacetime, is mojo. We held back Stalin with a remarkable resilience, and one damn great, if not entirely true, story. It’s good we’ve grown more truthful, but not that we’ve lost fighting spirit. Many seem too weary and disenchanted to fight for democracy’s advantages.That’s why, when it comes to (dis)information, the Russians can confidently say: “We’re winning.”Joseph Pearson is a historian who lectures at the Barenboim-Said Akademie and New York University in Berlin.

The credibility gap between Labour’s political theatre and the fiscal arithmetic has been obvious for weeks. The economic fundamentals haven’t changed for the chancellor, only the politics have – notably with Reform UK and the Tories makingausteritypolicies central to their pitch.Ms Reeves wants the coming argument to be that Labour is committed to protecting public services and jobs, while portraying her rightwing opponents as ideologically committed to shrinking the state. This is not a bad idea – if the wealthy fund it. And if a promise has to be broken, she has picked the politically optimal one – as even her shadow,Mel Stride, has conceded.Chancellors don’t usually give speeches before budgets – and if they do, they tend to say nothing. But Sir Keir Starmer needed a line to bat away awkwardquestionsfrom the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, and Ms Reeves provided it. She has also given cover for the leadership’s ideologically conservative fiscal policies, now enforced in parliament through a three-line whip on the two-child benefit cap during anopposition day debateabout welfare.Ministers could have tabled a neutral government amendment which talked about “keeping the two-child limit under review”. It would automatically have superseded oppositionamendments, avoiding a potential rebellion. But the government wanted a showdown with its critics. In the end, the Commons speaker did not call theamendments, but Ms Reeves took a chance to show the markets she wouldn’t bend to her MPs. Thepoundand stocks fell anyway, suggesting traders weren’t paying attention.This is a pyrrhic victory. This year the government is probably going to be spending close to6% of GDPmore than it gets back in taxes. Around half of that goes to the banks and pension funds viainterest paymentson gilts as well as throughquantitative easing. That’s double theamountinjected into the real economy that voters see. The rest is for public investment which brings long-term not short term benefits.This strategy runs a significant risk of blowing up in the government’s face. Ms Reeves is assuming that the private sector – either households or corporations – will take up the slack. But the only plausible way they will do that is through a borrowing binge, not productive expansion. The danger of such anunstable modelis that it produces similar conditions to the crash of 2008 – only this time with families starting from a weaker position.Many households are already highlyindebtedand facing acost of living crisis. They are unlikely to be splashing the cash. Companies have shown no sign of investing, preferring financial accumulation andshare buybacks. Banks arehoarding,not lending. If a government in a country that imports more than it exports insists on running too small a deficit, and the private sector is unwilling or unable to borrow and spend more than its income, then stagnation – or even recession – becomes the inevitable outcome.Ms Reeves calls this stability. But it is a gamble – one that rests seemingly on households borrowing what the state will not spend, and on markets believing in a confidence that never arrives. If New Labour’s tragedy wasdebt-fuelled growth, then the farce is pretending it can happen again.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A coming Brussels plan for affordable housing must be boldTue 4 Nov 2025 13.46 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 13.50 ESTShareAn entrenched housing crisis was one of the dominant themes in last week’s Dutch election, and it is not hard to understand why. House prices in the Netherlands havedoubledin the past decade, and a new-build home costs 16 times the average salary. Across the EU, affordability is not just a life-limiting problem in notoriously expensive property markets such as Lisbon, Madrid or Dublin. Speculative investment and a chronic supply shortage have also led to soaring prices inemerging areaswhere bigger, faster returns are attainable.Belatedly, this pan-European pattern is to be addressed by a Europe-wide response. Socialist MEPs made action on housing aconditionof their continued support for the two-term European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Next month, Brussels will publish its first affordable housingplan, which will target the destructive growth of the Airbnb-style rental market and aim to make it easier for governments to subsidise the building of new homes.That plan needs to be bold. As the first-ever EU housing commissioner, Dan Jørgensen, noted in aninterviewwith this newspaper last month, spiralling house prices and rents constitute a modern social crisis. The inability of societies to provide a decent home for first-time buyers making their way in life, and the pricing out of key workers from areas where they contribute every day to the common good, breaches the social contract in the most basic way. Politically, the issue has become a recruiting sergeant for the anti-immigrant far right, as asylum seekers and migrants arescapegoatedover a shortage which is in reality a market failure.Brussels has previously enshrined arightto social housing for vulnerable people and those on very low incomes, but generally stayed out of housing policy. Mr Jørgensen, a Danish Social Democrat, is right to suggest that a crisis that now encompasses vast numbers of middle-income earners needs to be seen with “fresh eyes”. Among the options being considered is a revision of state aid rules to allow greater public investment alongside private capital. The commission should also listen to mayors from across Europe, who have jointlylobbiedfor government spending on affordable housing to be exempt from EU debt and deficit ceilings.As a Guardianseriesof dispatches last year underlined, the origins of Europe’s housing crisis are multiple and complex. A growth in urban populations, and increased numbers of people living alone or in smaller family units, has played a part. The cumulative effects of the 2008 crash, the Covid pandemic and rising constructioncostshave disincentivised private developers. Perhaps most fundamentally, the financialisation of a property market in which housing is viewed primarily as a commodity, rather than as an essential public good, means profit has been prioritised over the interests of communities.The result is an age of housing anxiety, which restricts the horizons and thwarts the aspirations of millions of people, especially the young. The ability to buy or rent an affordable home is the starting point for living a fulfilled life. But almost one in 10 of the EU population spend a crushing 40% or more of their disposable income on rent or mortgages. Having rightly identified the corrosive impact that this is having on the social fabric, and the related political peril, Brussels should be ambitious and radical in its proposals next month.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Coolness resides in those people who are whole in themselves, who do not stop to question whether they are cool, but simply do, love what they do, and are generally excellent at it. Authenticity is cool. Less is more is cool. By definition you, Elle, are cool (you write for the Guardian).Celebrities: mostly pseudo-cool. Manicured cool, manufactured cool, is not cool.Miles Davis, for a large chunk of his existence, bathed in cool, personified cool and damn near invented cool.Cate Blanchett has a fair claim to cool. Billie Eilish, Charli xcx – in-your-face cool. Lorde – quirky cool. Daniel Craig, Brad Pitt, George Clooney – elder cool. Keanu Reeves – woman-of-his-own-age cool.Lewis Hamilton– openness, resilience, aching self-honesty; mega-cool. (Whereas Lando Norris is not cool. Oscar Piastri is cool, but Lando never.) Colson Whitehead is cool.And cool should not be confused with style. Style might mimic cool, desperately want to be cool, but style is merely a byproduct of cool; the love child of cool. Monty Don and his jacket are cool. Elegance, however – elegance is cool’s defiant lover; understated elegance, its inseparable companion.Silence can be cool, but not when it is cold. Listening more than speaking is cool.People who care more about others are cool. People who speak out against injustice are cool. Destroying the planet for financial gain is not cool. Killing civilians is not cool. Invading others’ countries, killing children or enabling the killing of children is not cool. Belief in supremacy is not cool. Hatred is not cool. Love is cool. Forgiveness is cool.Not everyone can be, but almost everyone could try to be, a little cooler.Denis BakerNyon, SwitzerlandThe coolest person ever to have existed was, of course, Miles Davis. Capitol Records brought out the album The Birth of the Cool under Davis’s name in 1957. Cool jazz became a thing after the end of the second world war, replacing bebop with a less frenetic sound.The music for the album was recorded in the late 1940s and arranged by the very cool Gil Evans. Sumptuous sounds of double instruments, singing the tunes. Maybe the music and the title are disconnected, being conceived at different times and amalgamated to fit the emergent cool jazz scene.I saw Davis perform in London in the 1970s and 80s. He never spoke to the audience; he came on the stage in dark glasses, played (often with his back to the audience), and then left while other musicians continued improvising on the theme. Later on I discovered that he was not a kind human being. Still cool, though.Robert BarnesHenley on Thames, OxfordshireThe research study mentioned by Elle Hunt missed the most important quality: it’s cool to be kind.David JeffreyWest Malvern, WorcestershireElvis was cool.Dolly PrenzelNashville, Tennessee, USThere is another reason we brown and black people are in the ads Sarah Pochin detests: we’re cool (Nigel Farage defends MP’s complaint about TV adverts as ‘ugly’ but not ‘deliberately’ racist, 27 October). I know that sounds flippant, but she’s attacking the soft power of those who are public-facing (and seen as caring in a time of crisis) in the NHS, and those who entertain. Music, publishing, acting, fine art – we’re there, producing work that appeals to the young – who will be voters very soon.Roshi FernandoAvening, GloucestershireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This is particularly the case when the crime is committed in an area identified as one with a high ethnic minority population. If there is a headline “Brixton rapist”, how many white people will assume the suspect is white if he is not identified by ethnicity?The reporting of ethnicity only when non-white creates the impression that a disproportionate amount of crime is committed by ethnic minorities. This, combined with the nebulous concept of “British values” – which apparently I do not share unless taught – suggests that those of my Caribbean heritage have a “criminal gene”, rather than being seen as a logical intersectionality between lack of opportunity, racism and social position.So let us create a level playing field and reveal the background of every suspect.Martin Forde KCLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The Liverpool of Arne Slot’s title‑winning debut season was the answer and, on their second successive November visit,Real Madriddid not have one of their own.Alexis Mac Allister opened the scoringlast season in the 2-0 defeatof the Spanish giants – though giant would be a huge exaggeration of their latest display on Merseyside – and settled the reunion of the European heavyweights as Liverpool, all controlled aggression and clear‑eyed intent, ignited their Champions League campaign and potentially their entire season. Another clean sheet and set-piece goal heightened Slot’s satisfaction on a raucous, reaffirming night at Anfield.Arne Slot turns focus to Manchester City clash after ‘impressive’ Real Madrid winRead moreXabi Alonso’s team were a distant second, the stellar names of Kylian Mbappé, Jude Bellingham and Vinícius Júnior confined to the margins throughout, and only Thibaut Courtois’s latest commanding display againstLiverpoolprevented a more emphatic victory. Alonso was booked on his return to Anfield. Trent Alexander-Arnold, his mural near Anfield vandalised earlier in the day, had his every touch booed after an 81st‑minute introduction.A late passage of play encapsulated the enjoyment Liverpool took from the game. An aimless cross by Alexander-Arnold was shepherded out of play on the opposite side of the pitch by his successor as Liverpool right back, Conor Bradley. The outstanding Bradley bumped Vinícius up in the air and out of his way for good measure.Fun was not the only feature to return at Anfield. Liverpool performed with an intensity, belief and organisation reminiscent of when they met Real 12 months ago. On that occasion Slot’s side carried with them the momentum from 13 wins in a 14-game unbeaten run. The circumstances were far removed here. This was a test of whetherthe win against Aston Villaon Saturday represented a fleeting recovery or one with substance. The signs were immediately encouraging for Slot and they would be sustained.Real did not get out of their half for the first five minutes as Liverpool started on the front foot. Florian Wirtz was to the fore on his recall and created the first chance when dispossessing Dean Huijsen near the corner flag. Mac Allister side-footed over, to his obvious disgust, but the tone for a thoroughly committed performance had been set.Bradley also laid an early marker in his personal battle with Vinícius. The Northern Ireland international again thrived against the illustrious names from Madrid. Last season he ignited the Anfield crowd with a thunderous challenge on Mbappé. Now he engaged in a running feud with Vinícius that drove the Brazilian to distraction at times. The Real forward was booked for hauling down Bradley as he surged into the visitors’ half and later performed a pathetic dive inside the Liverpool area when accidentally, and lightly, touched in the face by the full‑back.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold was booed after being introduced as a substitute.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters“One Conor Bradley” reverberated around the stadium although, of course, for more reason than the young defender’s finest display of the season. Alexander-Arnold’s first appearance at Anfield since his acrimonious summer departure added another intriguing subplot. The boos were mild when he appeared for the warm-up but cranked up in volume and venom when he entered the contest.For almost an hour it seemed that Liverpool’s ghost from the 2022Champions Leaguefinal, Courtois, would haunt them again. Wirtz seized on a careless touch by Huijsen to break free and squared perfectly for Dominik Szoboszlai as he arrived unmarked in the area. The midfielder connected cleanly but Courtois spread himself superbly to save at point-blank range.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Hungarian’s drive struck Aurélien Tchouaméni on the hand as he dived in to block. The referee, Istvan Kovacs, awarded a free-kick on the edge of the area but the France international was clearly inside when making contact with the ball. A spot-kick appeared imminent when Kovacs was sent to the pitch‑side monitor but he rejected the penalty claim and overturned the free-kick. Tchouaméni’s arms were in a natural position, apparently. Anfield reacted with understandable fury.The controversy emboldened Slot’s side more than the Spanish league leaders. Giorgi Mamardashvili saved from Bellingham and Arda Guler in quick succession but Courtois remained the busier keeper by far. Szoboszlai was denied twice by Real’s No 1 before the break, Mac Allister too, and Courtois’s one-man stand continued after the restart. Virgil van Dijk could only laugh when his close-range header from a Wirtz corner was tipped over. Courtois repeated the trick when the resulting corner from Szoboszlai was headed goalwards by Hugo Ekitiké.Courtois’s resistance was finally broken after Bellingham picked up a booking for fouling Ryan Gravenberch on the right. Conceding cheap free‑kicks was Real’s biggest failing on the night, according to Alonso. Szoboszlai swept over a powerful set‑piece – Alexander‑Arnold might have taken it had he stayed – and the improving Mac Allister bulleted a header through the goalkeeper’s guard. VAR intervened again to check a potential offside against the goalscorer. Anfield would not be enraged this time.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueLiverpoolReal MadridEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This time it included one that stretched back more than 55 years, when Leeds were the last English team not to concede a goal in their opening four matches, in the 1969‑70 European Cup campaign, under Don Revie.A determinedSlavia Pragueside, that came into this game unbeaten in all domestic competitions, gave it their best shot and thought they had been awarded a late penalty, only for the referee to overturn his decision after the video assistant referee called him to the pitchside monitor. The Czech champions finally recorded a shot on target in stoppage time. It meant Arsenal made it eight successive clean sheets in all competitions for the first time since 1903, when they were in what was the Second ­Division. A penalty from Bukayo Saka and two second‑half goals from the makeshift striker Mikel Merino sealed a 10th successive victory for Mikel Arteta’s ruthless side.Tottenham v Copenhagen, PSG v Bayern Munich, and more: Champions League – liveRead more“The most pleasing thing probably is not the record, it’s the mindset of the players. They are talking there about how we can still do better,” the delighted Arsenal manager said. “It’s one or two situations where we could have resolved better. If we do that we can keep improving and that record will have a bigger meaning.”There was also a special moment for Max Dowman as he became the youngest player inChampions Leaguehistory at 15 years 308 days when he was brought on to replace the excellent Leandro Trossard with the points already firmly in the bag.“What he’s done on the pitch, the first ball he takes, he takes people on, he starts to dribble, gets a foul,” Arteta said. “That’s personality, that’s ­courage and you cannot teach that. You have it or you don’t. It doesn’t matter what his passport says. You throw him in this context and he’s able to adapt.”It has been to Arsenal’s immense credit that they have maintained their winning run with so many attacking players missing through injury, with Viktor ­Gyökeres becoming the latest when he limped offagainst Burnley on Saturday. There are fears that the Sweden striker has injured a hamstring but it is hoped he could return with Gabriel ­Martinelli and the captain, Martin Ødegaard, in time for the north London derby againstto play Tottenham after the international break.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka scores from the penalty spot in the first half against Slavia Prague.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APIn the meantime, Merino was back in the role that he filled so ­admirably last season and showed he has lost none of his sharpness in front of goal with two well-taken finishes. ­Christian Nørgaard performed well in place of the suspended Martín ­Zubimendi and Piero Hincapié and Ethan Nwaneri also impressed on rare starts as Arteta rotated his squad.Jindrich Trpisovsky, the Slavia manager, is an experienced character who has won four league titles and he rated Arsenal beforehand as one of the best teams his side have faced, as well as describing Declan Rice as the best free‑kick taker in the world.However, it was the hosts who made the more encouraging start as Arsenal were unsettled by their all‑action pressing game, with 6ft 6in Czech international striker Tomas Chory providing a stiff physical test for their defence. Gabriel Magalhães needed treatment for a facial injury midway through the first half but there was never any chance of him coming off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another Saka shot was just as close and Gabriel was able to make first contact on the resulting corner, with the VAR spotting that Lukas ­Provod’s left arm had been in an unnatural position when he blocked the Brazilian’s goalbound header. Saka made light of the protestations from the home supporters behind the goal and stepped up to coolly give Arsenal the lead.Slavia Prague 0-3 Arsenal: Champions League – live reactionRead moreSlavia thought they should have had a penalty as well just before the break for handball by Hincapié but this time the referee from Azerbaijan was not interested. Any hopes that they could find a way back into the game were dealt a major blow within 40 seconds of the restart. Rice picked out Trossard in acres of space and his cross was volleyed in emphatically at the near post by Merino. This was Arsenal at their clinical best.Merino’s second was a real ­poacher’s finish as he beat ­Markovic to Rice’s cross to loop his header into the empty net. And it has been some week for Dowman, who became the ­youngest player to start a game for Arsenal in the Carabao Cup win against Brighton and has now surpassed Youssoufa Moukoko of Borussia ­Dortmund and his record of 16 years and 18 days set in December 2020. He looked totally at home in these ­surroundings and not even a late scare, when Ben White was penali­sed for a high boot before the VAR intervened again, could stop Arsenal on another perfect evening.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueSlavia PragueArsenalEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Gardner, the No 4 overall pick in the 2022 draft, has quickly established himself as one of the league’s premier defenders, earning All-Pro honors in each of his first two years.“New York it’s been real,” Gardner posted with a green heart emojion X.New York it's been real💚— SAUCE GARDNER (@iamSauceGardner)November 4, 2025The move comes just months after Gardner signed a four-year, $120.4m extension with the Jets – a deal that made him one of the highest-paid cornerbacks inNFLhistory. His departure signals a major shift for New York’s defense, which was built around his lockdown coverage skills. The Jets look set for a rebuild after slumping to a 1-7 record this season. The franchise has not made the playoffs since the 2010 season, the longest drought in the NFL.For the 7-2 Colts, the trade represents a clear push toward Super Bowl contention. With Gardner joining a secondary that already ranks among the league’s top units, Indianapolis are betting big on an elite defense to power their playoff run.It was the first of two massive trades by Jets general manager Darren Mougey before the deadline Tuesday. New York also agreed to trade defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys for a second-round pick in 2026, a first-round pick in 2027 and defensive tackle Mazi Smith, two people with knowledge of the deal told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the teams hadn’t announced the trade.Elsewhere, the Cowboys acquired linebacker Logan Wilson from the Cincinnati Bengals for a seventh-round pick on Tuesday. Hours beforethe Cowboys lost to the Arizona Cardinalson Monday night to fall to 3-5-1, owner Jerry Jones said the team had a deal in place to add a player who could improve the defense.Wilson had requested a trade after his playing time decreased for the Bengals, who have the league’s worst defense. The Cowboys traded two-time All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons to Green Bay before the season, leaving a huge void that Wilson doesn’t fill.“Some guys have the ability to see a certain key and, at the same time, take a step up in the hole,” Jones said on his radio show on 105.3 The Fan. “He knows how to get in the gaps right now. ... For what we need right now, he can come in immediately and help us at linebacker.”Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman, who led the Cowboys to three Super Bowls in the 1990s, mocked the deal during the ESPN broadcast of Monday’s loss to the Cardinals.“He may want to cancel that trade,” Aikman said. “I don’t think one player from what I’ve seen tonight is going to make a difference for this group.”NFL teams had until 4pm EST on Tuesday to make a trade.Meanwhile, the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles have been aggressive. General manager Howie Roseman continues adding players to a talented roster to improve the team’s chances for a repeat.Since the Eagles (6-2) last played a game, they’ve acquired edge rusher Jaelan Phillips and cornerbacks Michael Carter II and Jaire Alexander.Phillips, who came from Miami on Monday for a third-round pick, immediately bolsters the pass rush. The 2021 first-round pick had three sacks in his last five games for the Dolphins. All of Philadelphia’s edge rushers combined have three sacks this season.Carter gives the defense a veteran slot cornerback to allow defensive coordinator Vic Fangio more flexibility to use Cooper DeJean outside. Alexander, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, is a low-risk, high-reward acquisition.The Baltimore Ravens also added an edge rusher, getting Dre’Mont Jones from Tennessee for a conditional fifth-round pick. Jones has 4.5 sacks this season so he’s an upgrade for the Ravens (3-5) at a position of need.Several trades already went down last month. The Bengals acquired Joe Flacco. The Rams got cornerback Roger McCreary. Defensive end Keion White went to the 49ers. Safety Kyle Dugger was traded to the Steelers. The Jaguars and Browns swapped cornerbacks Greg Newsome II and Tyson Campbell.The Chargers added edge Odafe Oweh in a deal that sent safety Alohi Gilman to the Ravens.There are some high-profile players who could be on the move. Bengals All-Pro edge rusher Trey Hendrickson and Jets running back Breece Hall are among the biggest names being mentioned in trade speculation.Explore more on these topicsNFLIndianapolis ColtsNew York JetsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Their team had been too good for Copenhagen, who showed virtually nothing – certainly not in a positive sense.Spurs were 2-0 up after Wilson Odobert’s goal but there was a glitch when Brennan Johnson, who had opened the scoring, was sent off in the 57th minute. The foul on Marcos López was more clumsy than sinister yet when the referee, Erik Lambrechts, was advised to go to the pitchside monitor, Johnson’s involvement was over.Mac Allister sinks Real Madrid to ruin Alexander-Arnold’s return to LiverpoolRead moreEnter Micky van de Ven. The centre-half has becomesynonymous with the swashbucklingand he was at it again when he seized possession on the edge of his own penalty box and started to motor. It was a blur as he left four Copenhagen players in his wake, twisting initially to get through the first couple but picking up an inexorable head of steam when he straightened up.Nobody was going to catch him and there was an inevitability, too, about the finish once he got to the edge of the other area, the ball lashed home left-footed past the hapless Copenhagen goalkeeper, Dominik Kotarski. Spurs have their goal of the season already and it was possible to wonder whether it might compete for the more prestigious individual prizes in this area. There were shades ofSon Heung-min versus Burnleyin 2019 – and that one won the Puskas award.It was Van de Ven’s sixth goal of the season and it set Spurs up for a confidence-boosting win, one that took them to eight points from four unbeatenChampions Leagueties. João Palhinha, on as a substitute, added the fourth and they could even shrug off a late penalty miss from another replacement, Richarlison, his shot bouncing down off the crossbar and away.Were the crowd unhappy he took the kick rather than Dane Scarlett, another substitute, who had won it? The pre-match theme had been the ability of those fans to become a little vexed. There were boos for Richarlison as he prepared to step up. But this was not a night for those sort of musings, rather one to celebrate.Xavi Simons needed a performance and delivered; it was just a shame that he was withdrawn after Johnson’s dismissal, Thomas Frank sending on Palhinha. Johnson was good, too, before the red card and if Randal Kolo Muani missed a couple of sitters, he redeemed himself with a fine assist for Odobert.Spurs had been desperate for something on their own turf, the match framed by the horror of the Premier League defeat hereagainst Chelsea on Saturdayand everything that went with it – the continuation of the dismal home league form, the negativity of the fans, a furious Van de Ven blanking Frank at full time, as did Djed Spence. “Micky can keep walking past me if he’s angry after a game,” Frank said with a smile. “It seems like we had Lionel Messi turned into Micky.”View image in fullscreenBrennan Johnson takes the ball past Dominik Kotarski before giving Spurs a first-half lead.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersSpurs made the breakthrough in the 19th minute; the start of a more enjoyable occasion for them. Johnson had blown an early half-chance with a poor first touch but he got everything right when he darted in behind a couple of Copenhagen defenders and was found by a lovely curved ball from Simons.Copenhagen had been caught on a quick transition after Gabriel Pereira misplaced a simple pass. Worse was to come as Johnson surged onto the ball, Kotarski bolting from his line; a race he was never going to win. Johnson touched around him and finished from a tight angle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They arrived in London with a single point from their previous three Champions League ties. In short, all is not well with them. Their threat was minimal and there was too much looseness. They struggled sorely to build up against the Spurs press.Simons sniffed out spaces from the No 10 role; his turns were sharp, he probed with menace. He created two huge chances for Kolo Muani towards the end of the first half, which the on-loan Paris Saint-Germain striker fluffed. First, after Simons had worked a slick give-and-go with Odobert, Kolo Muani dragged wide from close range. And then, following a perfect Simons cross, he headed over when unmarked from six yards.Copenhagen had issues all over the pitch but they began in goal and Spurs’s second also had Kotarski’s prints on it. He looked odds on to get out to a long ball only he was so slow, offering Kolo Muani hope. The Spurs player kept running and he was able to make the block, the ball spinning high towards the empty neat. Whereupon Kolo Muani brought it down with a sumptuous touch before teeing up Odobert.The red card for Johnson never threatened to derail Spurs. If anything, they were more menacing with 10 men, counterattacking in waves, Copenhagen completely losing their way. Johnson’s challenge looked worse on the relays but he did catch López down the achilles with his studs. It led to Frank withdrawing Simons, who could not suppress his unhappiness. The scene was set for Van de Ven.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueTottenham HotspurFC CopenhagenEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Until now, LIV has proudly operated over 54 holes and three days, with the name itself partly based on a Roman numeral reference point. Could a rebrand to LXXII be imminent?The dramatic shift, which is believed to have come after pressure from players, means LIV will soon mirror the schedule traditional golf tours it once tried to upstage. LIV will, however, continue to run both individual and team competition elements.Jack Nicklaus wins $50m verdict in defamation case over LIV Golf allegationsRead more“The most successful leagues around the world – IPL, EPL [English Premier League], NBA, MLB, NFL – continue to innovate and evolve their product,” said Scott O’Neil, LIV’s chief executive. “And as an emerging league, we are no different. LIV Golf will always have an eye towards progress that acts in the best interest of LIV Golf and in the best interest of the sport.”A LIV statement added: “For each regular season event, the individual competition will be decided over 72 holes of stroke play, while the team competition will continue to run concurrently, with each team’s cumulative individual stroke play scores determining the team’s result.”The degree of “innovation” to which O’Neil refers will raise eyebrows given four days and 72 holes had been the model in golf’s existing ecosystem before LIV blasted onto the scene, coaxing household nameswith exorbitant contracts. It is understood some players in the LIV environment felt under-prepared for major championships due to the abbreviated nature of their standard playing domain. Umpteen players own equity in LIV teams. Golf’s official world-ranking system has also failed to recognise LIV, a matter which may change under the 72-hole model.“LIV Golf is a player’s league,” said the two-time major winner Jon Rahm. “We are competitors to the core and we want every opportunity to compete at the highest level and to perfect our craft. Moving to 72 holes is the logical next step that strengthens the competition, tests us more fully, and if the growing galleries from last season are any indication, delivers more of what the fans want.”Dustin Johnson added: “Playing 72 holes just feels a little more like the big tournaments we’ve all grown up playing.” Johnson, also a double major winner, has not finished in the top 10 in one of the big four events since 2023.All of this presents something of a public relations quandary. O’Neil’s predecessor, Greg Norman, explained two years ago why LIV had been given that precise name. The Australian said: “It is the Roman numeral for 54, which has two meanings: 54 is the lowest score you could shoot if you were to birdie every hole on a par 72 course, so there is an aspirational aspect to the thinking. It is also the number of holes to be played in each event.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marcus Smith, Henry Arundell and Ollie Lawrence are all in contention to be involved, with Manny Feyi-Waboso potentially the solitary starting back-three survivor fromthe victory against Australialast Saturday.The head coach, Steve ­Borthwick, had been hoping to announce his starting XV early this week only for that plan to be mothballed when Roebuck limped out of training prematurely on Tuesday with an ankle problem. Steward has not trained so far this week after sustaining a finger injury late in the win against the Wallabies, opening the way for Smith to replace him at full-back.Steward injury could offer Smith the chance to start for England against FijiRead moreRoebuck was an influential figure against Australia, his aerial skills contributing to two of England’s four tries, but if he is ruled unavailable England are not short of options. In an ideal world the management are keen to continue their ­experiment of deploying Tommy Freeman at ­centre, which leaves Arundell and Cadan Murley vying for slots in the ­matchday 23. And if the dancing Smith starts at 15, a ­bigger ­ball-carrying presence such as ­Lawrence would offer useful midfield balance.Arundell, meanwhile, has not played for England since ­departing for the French Top 14 following the 2023 World Cup, during which he scored five tries in asingle game against Chile. He has been in ­excellent form this season for Bath and, with his 23rd birthday looming on Saturday, is ­itching for another chance to show off his startling pace at the highest level.“It’s great to have him back and to see him score a crazy amount of tries already in the Prem,” the ­England assistant coach Kevin Sinfield said. “He’s been good in training and is banging on the door.”If Arundell, Feyi-Waboso and Smith do all start they would rank alongside the most elusive and attack-minded back three England have fielded. Sinfield is also convinced that Smith can develop into a top international full-back if he is not needed at fly-half, particularly in the absence of the injured George Furbank and Elliot Daly. “I think he is a world-class full-back,” Sinfield said.View image in fullscreenMarcus Smith could take advantage of the injuries to England’s attack.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters“A big part of his Lions inclusion, so I am told, was down to the fact he could cover 15. So we have got a world-class 10 but also a world-class 15. He is different to a lot of other ­full-backs worldwide but as you know he can beat people and he can be that second ball player for us.“Marcus’s preference, and I totally understand this, would be to play at 10 but you look across rugby, rugby league and football and there is an understanding that people play out of position from time to time to try and get your best players on the field.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was 84.Cheney at various times held the roles of member of Congress, White House chief of staff and secretary of defense, but it was as one of the country’s most powerful vice-presidents that he had the biggest impact, wielding great influence over the less experienced Bush.Dick Cheney remembered as steady, influential force in US politicsRead moreCheney was in office on 11 September 2001 during the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. While Bush was hurried to safety, Cheney worked with the defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, toassume policy control. Troops were soon in Afghanistan, fighting the Taliban and hunting al-Qaida.But Cheney’s place in history will be dominated by the decision to invadeIraq. He had been defense secretary during the first Gulf war against Saddam Hussein, in 1990 and 1991, but now Cheney and Bush’s public rationale for war was that the Iraqi dictator was linked to al-Qaida and thus 9/11, and possessed weapons of mass destruction. By March 2003, when US and coalition forces invaded, no proof had been found for either charge, and both were soon proved false.Although Cheney sought international cooperation, he also thought,he later wrote, that the Bush administration “had an obligation to do whatever it took to defend America”.View image in fullscreenGeorge W Bush and Cheney embrace following Bush’s acceptance speech during the final night of the Republican national convention in 2004.Photograph: Charles Dharapak/APThe death toll was high.Accordingto the Watson School of International and Public Affairs at Brown University, since 2001 “at least 800,000 people have been killed by direct war violence in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and Pakistan”.The treatment of prisoners taken by the US in its “war on terror” also provedhugely controversial. Out of office, Cheney continued todefendthe use of torture against detainees after 9/11.A Yale dropout who avoided service in Vietnam, Cheney nonetheless became a giant of Republican politics.He was a White House aide under Richard Nixon; the youngest ever White House chief of staff, to Gerald Ford; a member of Congress under Ronald Reagan; secretary of defense toGeorge HW Bush, and vice-president to George W Bush.When the younger Bush plucked him from theHalliburton corporationto be his running mate in the 2000 presidential election, Cheney had already survived three heart attacks. Nor was he immune to mishap: once, while vice-president, heshot a hunting partnerin the face.2:04A look back on the legacy of former US vice-president Dick Cheney – videoCheney underwent a successful heart transplant in 2012, after suffering premature heart disease, but was an “incredibly easy” patient to deal with, his long-term physician Jonathan Reiner told CNN.The former-vice president was “never concerned about what people knew about his heart disease. He was very open about it,” Reiner said. “He was the easiest patient, unbelievably compliant. And I think that’s one of the reasons why he was able to live such a long and full life.”Cheney’s daughter, Liz Cheney, followed him into Republican politics as a US House representative from Wyoming in the same seat her father had held while a congressman, but she was censured by the party after strongly criticising Donald Trump over the January 6 insurrection.View image in fullscreenDick Cheney and his daughter Liz arrive to vote at the Teton county library, Wyoming, during the Republican primary election in August 2022.Photograph: Jabin Botsford/APThe elder Cheney also attended an event to mark the first anniversary of the attack alongside his daughter, where he expressed “deep disappointment” in Republican party leadership, saying: “It’s not a leadership that resembles any of the folks that I knew when I was here for 10 years” and that “you can’t overestimate how important [January 6] is”.Cheney announced in 2024 that he would vote for Kamala Harris rather than the Republican nominee Trump, saying that “in our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump” and that he felt a duty to “put country above partisanship to defend our constitution”.Speaking to the Guardian in 2018, on the release of Vice, a darkly comic biopic starring Christian Bale, the Cheney biographer Jake Bernstein said: “There has been some rehabilitation with George W Bush. In comparison with Donald Trump, everyone starts to look better. ButDick Cheneyliked the fact everyone called him Darth Vader. I don’t think there’ll be an effort on his part to soften his image.”Explore more on these topicsDick CheneyRepublicansGeorge BushGeorge HW BushRonald ReaganRichard NixonUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Until recently, no frogs, toads, newts, or salamanders waddled or hopped on its volcanic islands.In the late 1990s, that changed. Some small tree frogs made their way from mainlandEcuadorto the islands, likely as stowaways on cargo ships.View image in fullscreenFowler’s snouted tree frogs arrived in the 90s and have become established on Isabela and Santa Cruz islands.Photograph: Rashid Cruz/Charles Darwin Research StationGenetic studies suggest that, over the years, there have been repeated accidental introductions to the archipelago, and the frogs now have a strong foothold on two islands: Isabela and Santa Cruz. The population is growing so fast that scientists have been struggling to keep track, estimating numbers in the hundreds of thousands on each island, across urban and agricultural areas, but also in the protected Galápagos national park.When San José marked frogs and tried to recapture them in the following 10 days – a technique commonly used to make estimates of animal populations – she could find just one marked frog every once in a while, suggesting their populations were huge. They estimated 6,000 frogs in a single pond. “Our estimates are still very conservative,” says San José. “I am pretty sure there are even more.”The frogs’ abundance is clear from the acoustic chaos they cause. “The amount of frogs and the noise – it’s really insane,” says San José.For the scientists, their nightly mating calls are helpful in estimating their presence in far-flung areas, using recorders like the one outside San José’s office. But local farmers say the calls are so raucous they keep them up at night.“During the wet season, I constantly hear their calls and they’re really loud,” says Jadira Larrea Saltos, a coffee farmer at Finca La Envidia on Santa Cruz.“At first it was a surprise, seeing the first frogs in the area,” says Larrea Saltos, who started noticing their abundance about three years ago when one jumped on her hand as she was walking out of her front door. Now she has more poultry on her property, which she thinks has helped keep the populations relatively at bay.The noise isn’t the fundamental problem, though. While the species has been in the Galápagos for almost 30 years, scientists still know very little about its impact on the archipelago’s delicately balanced land and water ecosystems.View image in fullscreenScientists are finding out more about the frogs, including that they can remain as tadpoles for as long as six months.Photograph: Joshua Vela Fonseca/Charles Darwin Research StationOn islands, it is very common for invasive species to thrive, as they have none of their natural predators. The Galápagoscounts 1,645 invasive species, many of which are seriously disrupting the safety of its endemic ones. Avianvampire flies are bleeding rare bird hatchlings dry, and the hardy blackberry plant is encroaching on the Scalesia forests.A2020 study suggests the invasive frogs are voracious insect eaters, and might be disproportionately consuming rare insects found only on the archipelago, or depleting the food sources of the islands’ rare birds, disrupting the food chain. Since the frogs’ diet is dominated by moths, they could even be affecting pollination on the islands, according to ecologistMaría del Mar Moretta-Urdiales, who was involved in the study.Bonobos transformed how we think about animal societies. Can we save the last of the ‘hippy apes’?Read moreThe Galápagos frogs have exhibited some unusual traits, including living in brackish water, which is uncommon for amphibians. Their metamorphosis process is also extremely variable, with some tadpoles turning into frogs very quickly and others taking a long time: San José observed one which remained as a tadpole in her lab for six months.“We really don’t know this part,” she says, worried the tadpoles could be affecting the islands’ freshwater, a very scarce resource in Galápagos. And even though studies show that the Galápagos diving beetle now eats large numbers of tadpoles in its diet, it doesn’t seem to be making a dent in their populations.View image in fullscreenMore research is needed to determine the best way to control the frogs without harming other species.Photograph: Rashid Cruz/Charles Darwin Research StationMethods to curb the frogs in the early 2000s were largely unsuccessful. Park rangers tried capturing large numbers by hand and gradually increasing the salinity of lagoons in vain. Researchsuggests spraying coffee– which is highly toxic to frogs – or using electrocution could help, but these methods aren’t necessarily safe for other rare Galápagos species.Without answers to more of the basic questions about their biology and impact, culling the frogs might not even be the right way to go, says San José.While she hopes the growing use of environmental DNA techniques and genetic analysis will help her team make sense of the invader, funding for the project has been hard to come by. “Everybody wants to give funding for preserving frogs,” says San José. “But it’s harder to find funding for an introduced frog that you might want to control for.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsAmphibiansThe age of extinctionInvasive speciesGalápagos IslandsConservationEcuadorAmericasWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Crops withered in fields nationwide, part of an estimated $60bn in damage ($160bn in 2025). Dust storms swept the midwest and northern Great Plains. Cities instituted water restrictions. That summer, unrelentingly hot temperatureskilledbetween 5,000 and 10,000 people, and Yellowstone national park suffered the worst wildfire in its history.‘How is this possible?’: a new film looks inside the appalling abuses of the Alabama prison systemRead moreAmid the disaster, George HW Bush, then Ronald Reagan’s vice-president, met with farmers in Michigan reeling from crop losses. Bush, the Republican candidate for president, consoled them: if elected, he would be the environmental president. He acknowledged the reality of intensifying heatwaves – the “greenhouse effect”, to use the scientific parlance of the day – with blunt clarity: the burning of fossil fuels contributed excess carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, leading to global warming. But though the scale of the problem could seem “impossible”, he assured the farmers that “those who think we’re powerless to do anything about this greenhouse effect are forgetting about the White House Effect” – the impact of sound environmental policy for the leading consumer of fossil fuels. Curbing emissions, he said, was “the common agenda of the future”.That clip – startling to anyone even glancingly familiar with Republican orthodoxy in the years since – appears early in The White House Effect, a new all-archival documentary that examines the evolution of the climate crisis from non-partisan reality to divisive political issue. The 96-minute film, now available onNetflix, takes its name from Bush’s unfulfilled guarantee of environmental action during his four years as president, a pivotal missed opportunity – if not, as the film implicitly argues,thepivotal missed opportunity – for bipartisan US leadership on the climate crisis. “There was this moment in time when the science was widely accepted, when the public was all about tackling this,” co-director Pedro Kos told the Guardian. “It was a mom and pop issue, as American as apple pie. Flash forward to four years later, and you have a completely split electorate. How do we get there?”The film, directed by Kos with Jon Shenk and Bonni Cohen, first rewinds the clock from Bush’s uncontroversial campaign promise back to the 1970s, when the science on the greenhouse effect became a public talking point. In news footage from the late 70s, ordinary Americans react to Jimmy Carter’s exhortation to face “a problem that’s unprecedented in our history” with patriotic enthusiasm; sacrifices, they confirm, may be necessary. By the early 1980s, faced with a gas shortages and hours-long lines at the pump, some of that enthusiasm had crumbled. As the Republican presidential candidate, Reagan responded to the discontent by blaming the government and calling for authority to be transferred back to the private sector (or, to use a Reagan euphemism, “experts in the field”) – setting the stage for the Republican party’s symbiotic relationship with large oil companies well aware of the impact of emissions on the climate. (To quote an internal Exxon document from 1984: “We can either adapt our civilization to a warmer planet or avoid the problem by sharply curtailing the use of fossil fuels.”)But the film largely focuses on Bush, a blue blood east coaster who made his fortune in the Texas oilfields, and who nevertheless began his term in office in 1989 determined, at least outwardly, to break from his predecessor on the environment. Bush appointed an environmental activist, William Reilly, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency; he exhorted Congress that “the time for action is now.” The White House Effect illustrates the political forces that eroded such purpose: the corporations that, according to their own internal documents, sought to downplay and discredit scientific evidence to protect their profit; the power games by White House chief of staff John Sununu, an ally of corporate lobbyists who outmaneuvered Reilly by encouraging climate skepticism in the aftermath of disasters such as Hurricane Hugo and the devastating Exxon-Valdez oil spill.The film works exclusively with meticulously edited archival footage – the team sorted through more than 14,000 clips from more than 100 sources, including VHS tapes stored in the New Jersey garage of a former Exxon Mobil publicist and a memo from a confidential “Global Warming Scientific ‘Skeptics’ Meeting” convened in 1991 by Sununu to empower media appearances by prominent climate contrarians. The reliance on archival was part of an effort to “immerse the public in a time when this wasn’t a political football – where we experience the politicization of the issue, rather than being told it”, said Kos. “Whenever you turn on a camera and interview someone in the present, that’s automatically going to come with the political connotations that the present brings.”View image in fullscreenA still from The White House Effect.Photograph: NetflixCohen and Shenk are veterans of climate change films; the married couple directed An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, the follow-up to Al Gore’s groundbreaking documentary on looming climate catastrophe. But with The White House Effect, “we wanted to do something very different from what we’ve done in our past work and what we think of as the ‘climate change genre’ of documentaries: we wanted to just drop the truth bomb of history,” said Shenk. “We need that, right? We just need the truth.”With archival, there’s “an opportunity to expand the conversation”, Cohen added. From man-on-the-street interviews to standard network broadcasts from the period, “hopefully you can see yourself in the film no matter who you are as an American, and feel that you’re part of the conversation, rather than some liberal film-makers preaching at you.”The platforming of climate skeptics on mainstream media and Sununu’s counsel seemed to have an effect on Bush. By 1990, speaking at a White House conference on the climate crisis, he equivocated where he once held firm: “One scientist argued that if we keep burning fossil fuels at today’s rate, by the end of the next century, Earth could be 9F warmer than today. And the other scientist saw no evidence of rapid change,” he said. “Two scientists, two diametrically opposed points of view. Now, where does that leave us?” It left the US hamstrung by political division. Two years later, the “environmental president” reluctantly attended the 1992 Rio “Earth Summit”, a major United Nations conference to set international targets for emissions reductions, advocating against such measures in the name of economic development and stability. The move, from the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, angered other countries, but Bush chided the international coalition: “I don’t think leadership is going along with the mob.” The seeds for outright climate denial, and the Republican party’s unfettered and open alliance with corporate interests, had been sown.View image in fullscreenA still from The White House Effect.Photograph: NetflixNearly three decades later, in 2019, Reilly rued how the US missed an “incalculably important” opportunity at Rio. “The advantage we might have had if president Bush had committed to seriously undertake the reduction of greenhouse gases is that we might have removed the partisan nature of the dialogue in the United States,” he said. If that prospect, in the era of hyper-partisanship, increasingly absurd natural disasters and the Trump administration’s dismantling of environmental regulation, feels deeply infuriating – well, Cohen argued, that’s the point. “Climate change films, at least in the last 10 years, have been trying to spoon-feed the medicine of the climate crisis, and then have a ‘hope bucket’ at the end, where you can feel OK,” she said. “Our job is to create the rage. We can’t shy away from the rage. And if this film, in all of its irrefutable archival historical glory, can create that rage, then we’ve succeeded.”The hope, she added, is that “you can feel the rage and you can feel the intolerance for the denial of truth, and that you’ll actually do something about at the ballot box. The hopelessness is when you feel like you can’t do anything. But we have a large electorate in this country – let’s get out there.”Kos, having overseen the mass archival effort, encouraged viewers to look at “the overall arc of history” – even in the face of the Los Angeles fires, the Texas floods, the rapid and unprecedented intensification of hurricanes like the one that devastated Jamaica just last week – “what good is despair going to do?” The truth of political power, for good and for ill, is “right there in front of our eyes.”“The choice is in our hands,” he added. “We’ve shown you a what-if moment from 1988. We’re now in another what-if moment.”The White House Effect is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsNetflixGeorge BushClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fact, many are making no profit at all, with 35% of the farmers reporting making a loss or breaking even.The report found this was true even for the highest-valued farms, with 28% of farmers with farms valued at £2.5m or more reporting a loss or no profit in the past year.When the UK was part of the EU, subsidies from the bloc for UK farmers made up as much as half of their income annually. After Brexit, the devolved British nations designed their farming payments regimes differently. In England, automatic payments were sharply cut and instead a scheme was introduced wherefarmers are paid for looking after natureunder the environmental land management scheme (Elm).This money is less than the subsidies they received from the EU, farmers say. The government recently cut England’s farmingbudget by £100m. The nature schemes have been beset by delays and the application process has been unpredictable. In March the schemeabruptly closedbecause the government said the budget had been allocated.Some farms have lost out under the new scheme. Asurvey by the National Farmers’ Unionfound that on average, upland farming businesses lost 37% of their support payments under the current Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) – the first component of Elm – and Countryside Stewardship (CS) options.The government’s decision to introduce inheritance tax for farms worth more than £1m led to outrage and protests as farmers said they would be unable to pass down the land to their children.Farmers are also on the frontline of climate breakdown, in recent years facing extreme floods and droughts that have led to some of the worst harvests on record.The McCain report reveals that 51% of farmers have considered leaving the industry in the past year due to financial strain, while only 4% believe current government support is adequate. More than six in 10 farmers (61%) say their work negatively affects their mental health, while more than a third endure 70-hour-plus working weeks during peak seasons.James Young, the vice-president of agriculture at McCain GB&I, praised farmers’ “unwavering resilience” and said the findings must serve as a wake-up call.He said: “As a company founded by farmers, we’re proud to stand alongside our 250 growers across the UK. It is crucial that industry bodies, the government and businesses work together to heed the warning signs in the Farmdex and take action to support farmers.”A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Farming plays a central role in our mission to kickstart economic growth, with farmers acting as stewards for our nation’s food security.“We know there are challenges in the sector and prolonged dry weather, followed by heavy rain, has hit some harvests. We are backing our farmers with the largest nature-friendly budget in history to grow their businesses and get more British food on our plates and are working with all food producers to make sure farmers get a fair deal.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingRural affairsBrexitnewsShareReuse this content"

Anational investigationlaunched into NHS maternity services across England, due to conclude at the end of this year, will be looking at racial disparities within maternity care, among other issues.The study also found that babies born to Asian mothers had a 36% higher risk of death than their white counterparts, even after adjusting for other factors that could contribute towards the higher rate of death.The research concluded: “There are stark socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities in babies admitted to and who die in neonatal units in England and Wales.”Rachel Drain, the quality and standards adviser at the Royal College of Midwives, said that the findings were “deeply concerning” and that “urgent, coordinated action” was needed to tackle the root causes of the disparities.“That means investing in the maternity and neonatal workforce, providing equitable and culturally safe care, and ensuring services are designed with women at their heart,” Drain said.“Every baby deserves the same chance of survival regardless of their ethnicity, background or circumstances.She added that the findings “point to systemic issues in how care is delivered and in the wider social conditions that shape women’s health before, during and after pregnancy. It is unacceptable that mortality rates in neonatal units are rising and inequalities are widening.”David Taylor-Robinson, professor of public health and policy in the Institute of Population Health at University of Liverpool, said: “Our Labour government has pledged to create the healthiest generation of children in our nation’s history.“Yet our findings reveal, in stark detail that, even in 2025, too many children face significant challenges from birth – and for some, even before they are born.He added: “I hope this evidence drives real action to address the wider factors that shape health outcomes.“Our research also highlights how existing biases and injustices in society are reflected in clinical settings, disproportionately affecting women and babies. These are inequalities we cannot afford to ignore.”Explore more on these topicsRacePremature birthHealthSocial exclusionChildrenUniversity of LiverpoolNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s why I stopped and promised I would never go near her again and I have kept that promise and I always will,” Carrick wrote.He offered never to be seen again, adding: “Sorry to you and especially sorry to (the girl) but she does not have to worry ever again. Please do not try to talk about it.”More than 20 years later, he allegedly raped and sexually assaulted a woman with whom he was in a “toxic relationship”.Opening the trial on Tuesday, Tom Little KC, prosecuting, said: “This case that you are now trying is primarily about sexual offending committed many years apart by this defendant.“But in respect of all the offending, whenever it was committed, the defendant was, we say, very predatory and controlling. This was not isolated offending but part of a pattern which the defendant perpetrated over many years.”Little said that, in 2022 and 2023, Carrick pleaded guilty to a “large number” of sexual and other offences relating to a significant number of women, nearly all of whom he knew.The first complainant in the trial was aged about 12 when she was sexually assaulted by the defendant, it was alleged.The woman was raped “on a number of occasions” and subjected to a sex act to which she did not consent, Little said.He told jurors: “Much of this offending occurred during the course of what was a toxic relationship between the two of them and which was controlled by him.”Little added: “It is also relevant for you to know that he was at the time of that relationship, as he was for many years, a Metropolitan police officer.”Neither of the alleged victims in the case can be identified for legal reasons. The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has asked parents who have received the letter to call the phone number on it, promising swift resolution by a new dedicated customer service team.It also said it was confident the majority of payments had been correctly suspended.Hillier wants to know what assurances parents will have that this will not happen again.“Is anyone who did not board a flight, train or ferry leaving the UK this year at risk of being considered to have emigrated?” she asked.Addressing many people’s concerns that individuals’ tax records have been tainted, she added: “Will HMRC’s assessment of emigration status affect individuals for the purposes of immigration, or non-domiciled tax status?”HMRC pauses child benefit crackdown after 23,500 families caught up in data errorRead moreOther questions in the list of 14 demands include how long was HMRC using travel booking data to “establish emigration status”. MPs also want to know why it used booking data, and not boarding data.They have also asked how HMRC came to determine emigration status when travel operators have no idea who is resident in the UK or not: “Given travel operators do not hold the national insurance numbers of passengers, how did HMRC verify it was halting payments of the correct recipients?”The committee, which will publish the answers, also wants to know what level of seniority was involved in the signoff of the anti-fraud initiative and what safeguards had been put in place to stop innocent victims being caught up in the crackdown.This week, several parents told the Guardian they had received a letter from HMRC despite not receiving child benefit for months, or in one case years.Several complained that they felt they were “being treated like criminals” when they had paid tax all their lives and HMRC could have simply checked tax records to see if they were living and paying tax in the UK.Another woman, who had previously suffered a stroke, said the letter was very distressing.“This kind of traumatic situation can cause a severe health breakdown with people like me who already had a minor stroke. Having to deal with providing A to Z information to prove that I haven’t been abroad is a lot of weight on top of tons of stress which is already part of our lives,” said Rachel.An HMRC spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry to those whose payments have been suspended incorrectly. Having reviewed our processes, we are now checking claims with customers first before suspending any payments, giving them one month to call us or write back.“We have a duty to protect taxpayers’ money, but we have also listened to our customers and taken swift action to ensure claims are only suspended when appropriate.”If you have beenaffected by this and want to share your story, email: lisa.ocarroll@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsChild benefitsBenefitsWelfareHMRCCommunitiesParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

Some of its troops have posted videos of civilians being shot, including in the town’s maternity hospital.As criticism grows, is UAE ready to walk away from Sudan’s RSF militia?Read moreThe two-year civil war between the Sudanese armed forces (SAF) and the RSF has created what the UN has described asone of the worst humanitarian crisesof the 21st century.More than 150,000 peoplehave been killed andmore than 14 milliondisplaced from their homes.Prosecutors at the international criminal court said on Monday that they werecollecting evidence of alleged mass killings, rape and other crimes in El Fasher.Guterres urged the warring parties to “come to the negotiating table, bring an end to this nightmare of violence – now”.“The horrifying crisis inSudan… is spiralling out of control,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the World Summit for Social Development in Qatar.“El Fasher and the surrounding areas in North Darfur have been an epicentre of suffering, hunger, violence and displacement. And since the Rapid Support Forces entered El Fasher last weekend, the situation is growing worse by the day. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped by this siege. People are dying of malnutrition, disease and violence.”His call at the Doha conference came as the SAF, based in Port Sudan, discussed whether to support a US-proposed truce, or to insist any ceasefire be dependent on the RSF withdrawing from Sudan’s cities, including El Fasher.View image in fullscreenA satellite image shows smoke rising from fires near El Fasher airport.Photograph: ©2025 Vantor/EPAThe fall of El Fasher gives the RSF control of all five state capitals in Darfur, raising fears that Sudan could in effect be partitioned along an east-west axis, but the Sudanese ambassador to the UK, Babikir Elamin, said there was little support for partition in Darfur itself.He said the priority was not a ceasefire, but action to end the massacres in El Fasher.The US has been trying since September to persuade the two sides to back a peace plan agreed by Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia that would start with a three-month humanitarian pause, followed by a permanent ceasefire that would start a nine-month transition to a civilian-led government.Washington is hoping that with the two-year civil war finally attracting greater world attention, the publicity may force the warring parties and their external supporters to relent on their maximalist positions.Initial signs from a lengthy SAF security and defence council meeting, however, are that there is strong resistance to the US plan developed by Donald Trump’s envoy toAfrica, Massad Boulos.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not clear how such RSF withdrawals could be enforced.Speaking in London, Elamin called on Washington to designate the RSF a terrorist organisation and for a ban on all arms sales to the UAE.The UAE denies supplying weapons to the RSF.Elamin said: “The RSF are now openly and publicly vowing to commit yet further crimes in cities and parts of the country. They have named the cities, the communities and the ethnic groups they are targeting.“Parts of the country that have never witnessed violence are now threatened. They are proudly making videos of themselves murdering innocent civilians. Some of them admit they have lost count of the number of people they have killed.”He said that as the SAF leadership had been exploring the US peace plan, the RSF were attacking El Fasher.“What is the reason for getting engaged in talks while they are still committing these kind of atrocities,” he asked. “Before we can discuss the kind of proposal, the international community should show some kind of seriousness in dealing with these atrocities that are still taking place in El Fasher. The priority now must be to stop the atrocities and this kind of genocide.”Explore more on these topicsSudanUnited NationsAntónio GuterresAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The EU enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, said Moldova, which has a population of 2.4 million, had made the greatest progress of any country in one year, “despite the continuous hybrid threats and attempts to destabilise the country on its EU course”.But there was sharp criticism of authorities in Georgia, which Kos said was an EU candidate country in name only. EU leaders halted Georgia’s accession talks last year, aftera violent crackdown on peaceful protesterswhen they took to the streets against the government’s Russian-inspired “foreign agents” law, which requires civil society groups to register under this stigmatising label if they receive funds from abroad.The European parliament reported in July that after the protests, more than 500 people had been detained under “administrative procedures”, 300 of whom were then subject to torture or other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment.Addressing Georgian government leaders directly, Kos said they were dragging people away from the EU: “If you are serious about the EU, then listen to your people and stop putting the opposition leaders and journalists and people who think differently than you into jail. Then we can talk.”Officials said the outlook was mixed for Serbia, whose authoritarian president, Aleksandar Vučić,has faced a year of mass protests against corruption,triggered by the Novi Sad railway station disaster, in which a collapsing roof canopy killed 16 people. The commission, long accused of being too soft on Serbia, has recently taken a stronger line against the government. Kos criticised “backsliding on freedom of expression and academic expression” and said Serbian authorities needed “to make their strategic choice clear” by avoiding anti-EU rhetoric.EU enlargement requires unanimity of the existing 27 member states, including Hungary. The Hungarian government is blocking the next step in accession talks for Ukraine, with the inadvertent effect of halting Moldova’s progress, as the two processes are linked.To evade the Budapest veto, officials are studying how to advance on negotiations without getting formal signoff from all 27 countries.Some politicians have called for the EU to reform itself before admitting new members, amid concerns a union of 35+ countries would be a recipe for political paralysis. This could mean, for instance, abolishing the veto on foreign policy that has been blamed for the EU being “held hostage” by one member state.Kos suggested it was not necessary to reform the EU before admitting Montenegro, population 624,000 orAlbania, which has 2.7 million people, according to World Bank data. She said there would be “no big financial implications” or for any area that is important to existing members of enlargement to these countries.Privately officials concede Ukraine, which had a prewar population of 41.4 million and has huge reconstruction needs, is a different story and entering the EU will pose tough choices for some of Kyiv’s staunchest allies, especially net recipients of EU funds, such as Poland.Asked about ending foreign policy vetoes, Kallas said the EU had a chance to discuss how it functioned, adding: “The world order is changing as we speak and it’s a question for us, what is our role there, and whether we are able to play this geopolitical game, and we are only able to play this game if we are able to adopt decisions.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionMontenegroAlbaniaBelgiumSerbiaUkraineMoldovanewsShareReuse this content"

Jared’s passion forSpace, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era. Congratulations to Jared, his wife Monica, and their children, Mila and Liv,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday.The move comes several months after Trumpwithdrew an initial nominationof Isaacman – an ally of the billionaire Elon Musk – for the same role back in May. Just one week before Isaacman’s confirmation, Trump posted: “After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head Nasa. I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be mission aligned, and put America first in space.”Isaacman’s initial nomination removal was just days after Musk’s officialdeparture from the White House, the SpaceX CEO’s role as a “special government employee” leading the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) having created turbulence for the administration and frustrated some of Trump’s aides.The president later appointed Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, to be actingNasaadministrator instead, pending the choice of a permanent space agency chief. In his renewal post, Trump addressed Duffy’s service briefly, writing: “Sean Duffy has done an incredible job as Interim Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).”Isaacman, the former CEO of the payment processor company Shift4, has broad space industry support but has drawn concerns from lawmakers over his ties to Musk andSpaceX, where he spent hundreds of millions of dollars as an early private spaceflight customer.He donated to Democrats in prior elections. In his confirmation hearing in April, he sought to balance Nasa’s existing moon-aligned space exploration strategy with pressure to shift the agency’s focus on Mars, saying the US can plan for travel to both destinations.As the soon-to-be leader of Nasa’s 18,000 employees, Isaacman faces a daunting task of implementing that decision to prioritize Mars, given that Nasa has spent years and billions of dollars trying to return its astronauts to the moon.In response to Trump’s renomination, Isaacman shared a note of thanks on X andsaid: “The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming. I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.“To the innovators building the orbital economy, to the scientists pursuing breakthrough discoveries and to dreamers across the world eager for a return to the Moon and the grand journey beyond--these are the most exciting times since the dawn of the space age-- and I truly believe the future we have all been waiting for will soon become reality.“And to the best and brightest at NASA, and to all the commercial and international partners, we have an extraordinary responsibility--but the clock is running. The journey is never easy, but it is time to inspire the world once again to achieve the near-impossible--to undertake and accomplish big, bold endeavors in space...and when we do, we will make life better here at home and challenge the next generation to go even further. NASA will never be a caretaker of history--but will forever make history.”Explore more on these topicsNasaDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsSpaceSpaceXElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Those who refused to return could face deportation “in the near future”.He appeared to contradict his foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, who after a visit to Damascus last week expressed doubt that many Syrians would choose to return given the devastation and ongoing instability, which he said made a dignified existence hard to imagine.Wadephul had previously taken a tougher stance, supporting the government’s line as it seeks to stave off the rise of the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).His apparent rethink drew criticism from some of his colleagues in the Christian Democratic Union, some of whom said he was discouraging the return of those who would be needed to rebuild their country.What few politicians want to touch on is the effect deportations might have on Germany, where hundreds of thousands of Syrians haveintegrated successfully, learning the language and joining the workforce– which is crying out for recruits at a time when the German population is rapidly ageing.More than 7,000 Syrian doctors are employed in the health sector, often in rural regions that have been poorly served in recent decades.Many of the 1.3 million Syrians living in Germany, almost a quarter of whom were born in their adopted home, have obtained citizenship, though the majority only hold temporary residence permits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The incident was the latest in a series of prominent events that have triggered public concerns over security and migration.Wadephul’s empathetic remarks towards Syrians were seized upon by the AfD’s co-leader Alice Weidel, who called them “a slap in the face to the victims of Islamist violence”.Merz said on Monday he had invited Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, to Germany to discuss the deportation of Syrians with criminal records, which has been a topic of debate in Germany for some time.Wadephul sought to paper over the perceived differences between his and Merz’s position, saying on Tuesday that he was actively involved in pursuing the goal shared by the entire government of increasing the number of deportations of migrants, including of people from Syria.Explore more on these topicsGermanySyriaEuropeMigrationRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

However, launching a single rocket into space emits hundreds of tonnes of CO2.Objections could be raised by astronomersconcernedthat rising numbers of satellites in low orbit are “like bugs on a windshield” when they are trying to peer into the universe.The orbiting datacentres envisaged under Project Suncatcher would beam their results back through optical links, which typically use light or laser beams to transmit information.Major technology companies pursuing rapid advances in AI are projected to spend $3tn (£2.3tn) on earthbound datacentres from India to Texas and from Lincolnshire to Brazil. The spending has fueled rising concern about the impact on carbon emissions if clean energy is not found to power the sites.“In the future, space may be the best place to scale AI computers,” Google said.“Working backward from there, our new research moonshot, Project Suncatcher, envisions compact constellations of solar-powered satellites, carrying Google TPUs and connected by free-space optical links. This approach would have tremendous potential for scale, and also minimises impact on terrestrial resources.”TPUs are processors optimised for training and the day-to-day use of AI models. Free-space optical links deliver wireless transmission.Elon Musk, who runs the Starlink satellite internet provider and the SpaceX rocket programme, last week said his companies would start scaling up to create datacentres in space.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery. If you like reading our newsletter, forward this email to five friends with a demand they sign up like it’s a chain letter warning of bad luck for five years. In this week’s news, AI companies hit mind-boggling financial milestones such as a $5tn valuation, a $100bn quarter, and a string of deals worth nearly $600bn.The AI boom’s incomprehensibly vast numbers make it hard to criticizeLast week, the chipmaker Nvidia hit a valuation of $5tn. Just three months prior, it became the world’s first $4tn company. Microsoft reached a $4tn valuation last week, as did Apple. On a smaller scale, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet all reported their quarterly earnings. The sums were vast. Google’s parent reaped its first $100bn quarter. Amazon reported stellar growth in its cloud computing unit and added 13% to its stock price. Meta faced an unexpected tax bill of $16bn. All of the tech giants, except Apple, revised their capital expenditure figures upward, declaring to their investors that they would spend billions more on the real-world infrastructure that underpins artificial intelligence. The revisions added tens of billions to a total that’s already in the hundreds of billions. Alphabet alone estimated its capital expenditure at between $91bn and $93bn for the upcoming year. That estimate is up from an original declaration of $75bn in February and a revised figure of $85bn announced in July.Not to be outdone by its publicly traded rivals, OpenAI,recently converted to a for-profit enterpriseand mulled an initial public offering at a valuation of $1tn. The world’s most valuable startup has been on a dealmaking spree, signing agreements with Nvidia, which committed to investing $100bn in OpenAI in September; Microsoft, which signed an agreement in early October for OpenAI to spend $250bn on Azure cloud services; and Oracle, another cloud computing giant that OpenAI agreed to spend on in September, this time $300bn. On Monday, the ChatGPT-maker announced a deal with Amazon Web Services for $38bn. In total, OpenAI has promised to spend $588bn in the coming years.Nvidia’s valuation is now larger than Germany’s entire annual economic output in 2025 ($4.66bn). Put another way, the market capitalization of Nvidia is two and a half times the market capitalization of every publicly traded company in Germany put together, roughly $2.04tn in 2024, per the World Bank. How can one company be worth more than the world’s third largest economy, a nation of 83.5 million people, a country whose economy forms the financial backstop of an entire continent?Read more:Boom or bubble? Inside the $3tn AI datacentre spending spree | Artificial intelligence (AI) | The GuardianThe difficulty in comprehending the financials of the AI boom makes it difficult to criticize with clarity or force. What could I say to an avalanche? Even the most insightful analysis seems like it will be bowled over and crushed beneath the weight of a billion-dollar datacenter. All of these numbers buck understanding. There is nothing in your individual human life that you could compare them with. How would I spend $91bn? How would I make hundreds of billions of choices? Thinking about them feels bizarre. Describing Meta’s earnings as “mixed” is strange, though they were, by Wall Street experts’ estimates.The circular, multibillion-dollar deals between the companies atop the boom have given rise to fears of overinflated value and financial fragility. Should one company falter, it seems the others might follow suit and bring the US economy down with them. So far, they show no signs of stopping their joint rampage.View image in fullscreenAn Nvidia Blackwell GPU is displayed at Computex in Taipei, Taiwan, last year.Photograph: Ann Wang/ReutersOn the more populist side of that criticism are reports that AI has yet to find an essential use case other than cheating on homework assignments. It can’t adequately replace workers, no matter how many of them a CEO might lay off. About 95% of AI pilots conducted in businesses to date have failed,MIT researchers foundin August.The financials of the AI boom are so enormous as to defy comprehension; its digital size is immense as well. Large language models such as ChatGPT, Claude Sonnet and others function in part via parameters, variables that define how the model makes predictions of what word should come next. These unseen knobs tweak the response number in the hundreds of billions, with some reports indicating GPT-5 might make use of a trillion of them.AI’s physical imprint on the world matches the magnitude of the technology’s financial scale. Dara Kerr, one of the Guardian’s technology reporters, visited the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, home to the largest data center in the US and several of its smaller siblings, on a reporting trip last week. Here she describes its unbelievable scale:The Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center stretches from Interstate 80 up into the dry Nevada desert mountains. The complex spans tens of thousands of acres and is home to nearly 200 companies, both for fulfillment and logistics operations and tech data centers. That includes Google, Microsoft and Tesla. Some businesses have several data centers, each multiple football fields long, that snake up the desert valleys. The industrial center’s landmass makes up 65% of the county’s territory. It’s so big, it’s almost hard to comprehend.Should you buy that gadget?How do Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 compare against hearing aids?

The Trump Media and Technology group will introduce its “Truth Predict” feature, which will allow users “to trade prediction contracts related to major events and milestones, such as political elections, interest and inflation rate changes, commodity prices on gold and crude oil, events across all major sports leagues, and more” using the new product, though when it will go live is unclear.Devin Nunes, TMTG’s head, said of the feature: “For too long, global elites have closely controlled these markets – with Truth Predict, we’re democratising information and empowering everyday Americans to harness the wisdom of the crowd, turning free speech into actionable foresight.” In classic Trumpian fashion, Nunes hypocritically gnashes his teeth at “global elites” from a perch high in the eyrie of US power.Something feels off about this arrangement, like if the boxer in the fight was also the bookie. Trump is the president of the United States and is asking his constituents to put money on the outcome of elections that he will be campaigning in. He is in control of the policies that can determine the rates users bet on. Though he’s heading towards his two-term limit in the presidency, he hasflirted with an unconstitutional third term. Would US citizens bet on whether he can make it happen?Even the creation of the Truth Predict feature feels like inside basketball (more on that sport in the next paragraph). Crypto.com has donated $11m to Trump’s causes, theFinancial Timespoints out. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has closed an investigation during Trump’s term, and the company has applied for a banking charter with the regulator. Trump Media and Technology group signed a deal to buy billions of dollars’ worth of Cronos, Crypto.com’s token.Gambling pervades US society more than ever. Trading on election outcomes was legalized just last year. Betting volumes on the prediction market Kalshi have reached $1bn per week, according to another Financial Times analysis. The infection began with sports betting, which has reached a fever pitch. My colleague Bryan Armen Graham describes the implications of scandal, dubbed Operation Nothing But Bet by FBI investigators, that rocked professional basketball in the week before Halloween, with an NBA player, a head coach and 30 others arrested:The NBA gambling scandal represents a culmination of the years-long embrace between professional leagues and the multibillion-dollar gambling industry that has now crossed the line from synergy into scandal. It’s the most significant corruption crisis to hit a major American league since betting was legalized in most US states, and the most revealing picture yet of how deeply gambling has fused itself into the bloodstream of professional sports.When will politics face its own version of Operation Nothing But Bet?The wider TechScapeNHS hospitals to test AI tool that helps diagnose and treat prostate cancerIn Grok we don’t trust: academics assess Elon Musk’s AI-powered encyclopediaUkrainian computer game-style drone attack system goes ‘viral’Character.AI bans users under 18 after being sued over child’s suicideRevealed: Israel demanded Google and Amazon use secret ‘wink’ to sidestep legal ordersExplore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterArtificial intelligence (AI)newslettersShareReuse this content"

It now employs more than 150,000 people worldwide.The family empire expanded via a series of big acquisitions including the 1987 purchase of the Ashok Leyland group, which included parts of the defunct British automotive business British Leyland. The group also bought Gulf Oil from the US oil company Chevron in the 1980s.Gopichand Hinduja was embroiled in controversy in 2001 when it came to light that he had written toPeter Mandelson, a government minister at the time, about obtaining a UK passport for his brother Prakash.The brothers alsodonated £1m through their charitable foundation to the Millennium Dome project in London, which Mandelson was then overseeing.The brothers’ late father, Parmanand, began trading carpets, tea and spices in 1914, in a part of what was then British India but is now Pakistan. He later took the business to Iran.The family’s London home is an 18th-century mansion on Carlton House Terrace, overlooking St James’s Park and close to Buckingham Palace. Their property portfolio also includes the historic Old War Office (OWO) building in Whitehall, which they have turned into a luxury development.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Carmakers in the EU warned last weekthey were “days away” from production stoppages.The trade tensions with the EU are in contrast to the truce struck between China and the US last Thursday.The White House said in its readout after the agreement that Chinawould “eliminate” all “current and proposed export controls on rare earth elements and other critical materials” and end the semiconductor “retaliation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Court documents show the US Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation told the Dutch foreign ministry in June: “The fact that the company’s CEO is still the same Chinese owner is problematic … It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced.”The dispute escalated last week when Nexperia told customersall supplies to its Chinese factory had been suspended. Although Nexperia’s chips are manufactured in Europe, about 70% are packaged in China before distribution.Wingtech said the actions of the Dutch government “appear to be aimed at allowing a new Dutch-owned company to take Nexperia”. It warned that “any Nexperia-successor company is doomed to fail”, adding that “80% of Nexperia’s back-end capacity is within mainland China”.A spokesperson said: “If this matter is not resolved very soon, there will be no company left for customers to return to, and hundreds of people in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK will lose their jobs with many more affected indirectly across Europe. Nexperia’s European employees are very concerned about this, but the company’s senior Dutch management appears oblivious to these concerns.”The Dutch economic affairs ministry told Reuters that talks between the two governments were still under way. “We remain in contact with the Chinese authorities and our international partners to work toward a constructive solution that is good for Nexperia and our economies,” a spokesperson said.The dispute adds to the turmoil that UK auto manufacturers have faced after a cyber-attack forced Jaguar Land Rover, Britain’s largest carmaker, to halt production in September.JLR has resumed production, supporting asmall boostto UK factories in October.

Premiered in Berlin this summer, and here receiving its first UK performance from the composer andPierre-Laurent Aimard, Divisions packs an enormous amount of concentrated musical thought and pianistic imagination into its 15-minute span.That’s exactly what we would expect from the famously meticulous Benjamin. His focus in the new piece is the interaction between two players at a single instrument as they counterpose an ever-changing variety of rhythms, dynamics and pianistic effects. The exploration is ingenious and compelling, from the enigmatic opening to an abruptly ambiguous ending which brought smiles all round.There are moments of Ravel-like delicacy and of great emphasis along the way, as well as some almost cosmic silences. But it works not just because of Benjamin’s musical inventiveness but because the human dialectic between the two players creates a sense of freedom and possibility lurking within the work’s scrupulously crafted pages. The occasional need for air in Benjamin’s music, whichRobin Holloway identifies in his spectacular new survey of western classical music, would not be a fair complaint here.View image in fullscreenGeorge Benjamin and Pierre-Laurent Aimard at the Wigmore Hall, 3 November 2025.Photograph: Darius WeinbergThe Benjamin premiere came as the climax to what was already a characteristically ambitious recital by Aimard. He had opened with the imposing and sacramental Révélation, written in 1915 byNicolas Obouhow, a piece and a composer whom Aimard has often championed for his mystic modernism. Pierre Boulez’s groundbreaking first piano sonata of 1946 followed, with the toccata-like second movement electrifyingly played.The contrast between the Boulez and Benjamin’sShadowlines, the intricate and delicate set of canon-based pieces written for Aimard in 2001, which brought the first half of the recital to a close, could hardly have been greater. Aimard’s performance after the break of Ravel’s graceful 1917 wartime invocation of 18th-century France, Le Tombeau de Couperin, provided further evidence that he remains equal to most challenges and continues to be one of the essential keyboard advocates of our era.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicGeorge BenjaminWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

But as well as the sounds of war, which continue three and a half years into Russia’s full-scale invasion, music still plays, clubs remain open during the day (closing well before the midnight curfew), and electronic dance music remains an intrinsic part of many Ukrainian lives.Kyiv’s iconic clubs,such as K41, became bomb shelters before transforming into frontline fundraisers. Parties doubling up ascleanup operationsare held at strike sites. New venues such asAbo Records– the first of many creative spaces to set up shop in an abandoned liquor factory – have emerged as gathering points where you might share a cigarette with a sniper or combat medic as easily as with a DJ. But the rehabilitative power of dance music is most evident at the Superhumans centre, near Lviv in the west of Ukraine. Here, the most critically war-wounded are treated with prosthetics and reconstructive surgery, and psychological support is given to children and adults affected by the war. And within the range of treatment is music therapy.Howard Buffett, the son of Warren Buffett and one of the centre’s chief funders, suggested forming a Superhumans band, so the centre teamed up with music charityVictory Beats, which was set up one year into the war to provide veterans with relaxation and a nonverbal outlet for emotional expression.“We were working with a 25-year-old soldier with severe brain damage and limited use of his hand,” the charity’s founder, Volodymyr Nedohoda, remembers. “We started with a [sound-based] relaxation session designed to calm the nervous system, but stopped almost immediately because the low frequency triggered pain. When he started to feel better, he asked for a DJ console.”If I go two days without playing music, that’s when the phantom pains and bad thoughts startRoman CherkasHaving witnessed the efficacy of electronic music as therapy firsthand, Negodada and Vlad Fisun – a DJ and former editor-in-chief of Playboy Ukraine – partnered to create theEnterDJprogramme, which teaches veterans the basics of mixing. All that users require is a laptop, headphones and an internet connection; some tune in from home, others show up to a dedicated space in the Superhumans centre. “Immersed completely in the process, playing track by track without paying attention to low or high frequencies, the soldier started to use his injured hand,” Negodada says. The patient remained with EnterDJ for the duration of his stay at Superhumans, and Negodada saw him perform a DJ set a year later: “He still has health issues but remains passionate about DJing.”Speaking with the same stoicism that underpins most of my conversations with Ukrainians, another veteran, Oleksandr, tells me about the incident that led him to Superhumans and EnterDJ. “I was serving in Poltava when a missile destroyed my leg,” he says. “I remember everything about it. The blast, phoning my commander to say I was alive, realising I’d have to drive an automatic car, worrying about the blood in my car after the evacuation.” He laughs at the absurdity, and continues. “In hospital, I lost nearly all my blood and had to be resuscitated. I woke up knowing my leg was gone, but thankful the rest of my body and brain were OK. That’s most important.”View image in fullscreenOleksandr Ivanko performing.Photograph: Solomia GavrylyakFor Oleksandr, EnterDJ became a daily routine, “to get some good moments if the day was hard, or to celebrate if I gained something in rehabilitation”. Within six months, he was performing alongside the Lviv Philharmonic Orchestra, using a Midi controller to layer sounds over a composition written with British composer Nigel Osborne.Oleksandr had started off using singing bowls in a sound therapy session. “Then I saw the DJ console and it reminded me of my school days, trying to mix music on a laptop.” Before being fitted with a prosthetic leg, EnterDJ “helped distract me from the trauma and rehabbing”, he says, holding his kind gaze steady. “I now listen more deeply, breaking music into parts for mixing, and even composing. We have composed ambient music for therapeutic purposes; I added electronic effects to live classical instruments. The audience relaxed deeply; some even fell asleep. So we met our goal!” Most recently, Oleksandr played for Prince Harry on a visit to Kyiv.EnterDJ’s students are encouraged to find their own DJ style. They are able to pull tracks from a catalogue of music donated by record labels across the world, including Lyon’s Hard Fist, Sao Paulo’s Tropicana, and Lisbon’s Disco Extendes, as well as Ukrainian labels such as Mystictrax, 2064, Regulardisco, and Trance Pandemic.Roman Cherkas, who served in the Third Tank brigade in eastern Ukraine, has gravitated towards drum’n’bass. He joined the EnterDJ programme after months of surgeries, prosthetics and rehabilitation at the centre, after losing both of his lower limbs in a mortar strike. He speaks to me on a call from his home, ready with a drum’n’bass mix. “Right now, I still don’t feel mobile, I can’t move around normally. Music has become energy for me, life energy,” he says. “If I go two days without listening or playing, that’s when the phantom pains, bad thoughts, and even depression start. For me, music is a normal task, my remedy.”After six months in the programme, Roman performed in Lviv at a showcase by one of the world’s leading drum’n’bass labels, Hospital Records. He speaks slowly and thoughtfully about how music shifts his headspace. He becomes completely absorbed by it, sometimes sitting in his chair mixing for six-hour stretches. “I tried working with psychologists but it didn’t work for me. You have to consciously switch your brain on and imagine lifting your legs, which is very difficult. With music, it’s the opposite, it switches my mind automatically and makes me feel better.”View image in fullscreenRoman Cherkas performs live.Photograph: Yury StefanyakOlga Rudneva, chief executive of Superhumans, is proud of how veterans who pass through Superhumans are performing on big stages, but underlines what she finds most important about the program: “Positive healing effects for patients; reduced phantom pain; positive mood and more socialisation.”However, the EnterDJ programme is used not just by injured veterans but by children and adults across Ukraine, and its creators highlight its broader power. Chief executive Yevhen Skrypnyk introduced techno to his hometown of Sloviansk in eastern Donbas with Shum Rave(“shum” meaning noise in Ukrainian), a party with the purpose to rebuild the city and its culture after liberation from Russian occupation back in 2014. “We all grew up too early,” he says. “We know what it means for a friend to die in the war, or what it means to wait for your friend in captivity. I’ve been in the events industry for more than 10 years, but it was never just about the party; it’s about how we could connect people and destroy stereotypes. In Ukraine, we are fighting for our lives, and for our culture.”Andreas Boesch, partnership curator at EnterDJ, agrees, saying that music and culture are the best means Ukraine has to fight against Russian propaganda. “It’s an international language, it can be understood everywhere, by everyone. You can try and convince people of everything that’s happening here, but it’s hard to touch them in a big way because they’re so far away and it can be difficult to understand. But with music, you can pass on greatness.”Explore more on these topicsElectronic musicDance musicUkraineEuropeRussiaHealthHospitalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No: this is actually the umpteenth iteration of the Predator franchise, which has a roach-like unkillability itself, having started in 1987 with Arnold Schwarzenegger facing an extraterrestrial creature rustling and snarling in the Central American jungle.Predator: Badlands is just about kept from flatlining by Elle Fanning’s effortless charm, though it shows what happens when the Predator in question must, in the service of narrative development, be humanised and made sympathetic and vulnerable and … kinda … nice? What happens is that it ceases to be the Predator, so something or someone else has inevitably to fill the Predator role.So now there is a youngling from the unsightly Predator tribe called Dek (played in heavy prosthetics by New Zealand actor Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi); a creature with those distinctively horrendous choppers with a sort of cluster of mandible claws on it. (A real horror film would also show us what his genitals look like.) Dek’s alleged softness and weakness mean that he is about to be killed by his stern Predator father, but he escapes to go on a mission to reclaim his predatorial honour by killing a far-off fearsome monster called the Kalisk, which even his father is supposedly afraid of.Monster munch: can Predator: Badlands survive the removal of its unashamedly ultraviolent roots?Read moreBut Dek finds that two robot-human bioclone twins known as “synths” are on the Kalisk’s trail as well, both played by Fanning. One is goofy, cutesy, fallible Thia, a kind of manic pixie dream synth who winds up having an odd-couple friendship with Dek. The other is a ruthlessly efficient dead-eyed Stepford ninja who winds up being the real hunter-killer and effectively negates the franchise’s whole identity.The sheer pointlessness of everything that happens subtracts the oxygen and even Fanning’s imperishable star quality can’t save it.Predator: Badlands is out on 6 November in Australia, and on 7 November in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsScience fiction and fantasy filmsHorror filmsElle FanningreviewsShareReuse this content"

WhilePicnic at Hanging Rockremains his finest work, his foray into Hollywood culminated in the utterly transfixing, intermittently horrifying Jim Carrey vehicle The Truman Show. Almost 30 years after its theatrical release, the film has only grown in stature and prescience.Ostensibly a dark satire on voyeurism and the inexhaustible manipulations of the media, The Truman Show predated the television juggernaut Big Brother by a single year, and it’s hard not to see something causal in that. Both are about surveillance and the murky line separating reality from entertainment; both involve hidden cameras watching the participants’ every move. The key difference – the one that gives the film such moral potency – is that Truman doesn’t know he’s on TV.The film follows Truman Burbank, an insurance salesman whose entire life takes place not on the island of Seahaven as he believes, but on an elaborate film set. His family, including his perky wife, Meryl (Laura Linney), best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich), and even his mother (Holland Taylor), are paid actors desperate to keep the illusion alive and the show on air. Pulling the strings is the God-like Christof (Ed Harris), who directs the show from the “moon”.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWhen the film begins, Truman already longs for a way out while pining for Sylvia (Natascha McElhone), the girl who got away – or rather was shipped off set for screwing with Christof’s casting plans. Seahaven’s antiseptic cleanliness and sunny palette may obscure its insidious, monocultural grip. But as Truman’s suspicions grow, and the community conspires to keep him both ignorant and imprisoned, things get very dark indeed. It’s the creepiest film in full light I know (and yes, I’ve seen Midsommar).View image in fullscreenJim Carrey as Truman Burbank and Laura Linney as his wife, Meryl, in The Truman Show.Photograph: Ronald GrantThe first sign comes, in the opening minutes, from the heavens: a large stage light falls from the sky, smashing on to the street outside Truman’s cookie-cutter house. The interruptions continue from a mixed radio signal to a false elevator, and we find ourselves cheering Truman on as he forces open the doors of perception. Christof – with a fascistic tendency to throw his actors under the bus – tries the soft power of diplomacy first, sending Truman’s wife and mother as agents of compliance. When they fail, Christof sends the deadliest weapon in his arsenal: the best friend.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Marlon placates Truman with the undeniable lure of fraternity: “Think about it, Truman. If everyone was in on it, I’d have to be in on it too.” But he’s being fed his lines directly by the repugnant Christof. We are in the world of the Stasi, of an authoritarianism that infects the domestic sphere, poisons the very words coming out of our mouths, and Emmerich, as Marlon, brilliantly captures the moral price the conformist pays to maintain the status quo. All the horrors of political supplication are written on his face.View image in fullscreen‘Carrey’s precision as a comic performer creates a flawless carapace under which his existential essence seethes’: Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank.Photograph: Cinetext/Paramount/AllstarCarrey is sublime, and we can be thankful Weir waited a full year in pre-production to secure him. His cheesy grin and “good afternoon, good evening and good night” evoke the gee-willikers optimism of 50s middle America, and he’s so perfectly in sync with the simulated world around him that his doubt and determination once the veil drops feel almost revolutionary. Carrey’s precision as a comic performer creates a flawless carapace under which his existential essence seethes.One of the miracles of The Truman Show is the way it trades in both the allure and the artifice of cinema; it’s like a magician revealing mid-trick what’s up their sleeve. Production designed to within an inch of its life and equally emotionally contrived, Seahaven still seduces because it plays as much on our fears as our dreams. It’s no accident Christof has to invoke lifelong phobias in Truman to keep him “safe”.Rewatching it now, Weir’s masterpiece feels less about voyeurism and the entertainment industry and more about the individual and their relationship to the state. We’ve created a world of pure solipsism, where we are all our own Truman and Christof combined, endlessly editing and curating our lives in the hope someone’s watching. But we are still in thrall to an economic model that sees everything for sale; remember The Truman Show can only exist because its world is littered top to toe with product placement. It’s a hermetically sealed ecosystem of wealth promotion that rides roughshod over the rights of the individual.

Yet it remains a key influence for film-makers from Sofia Coppola to Celine Song, James Ivory to Greta GerwigJames HarveyTue 4 Nov 2025 02.03 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 12.37 ESTShareThe first time David Lean’s 1945 romantic masterpiece was shown to the public, the audience were in stitches. It not being a comedy, this was far from ideal. The director was so embarrassed, he returned to his hotel planning to break into the film lab and burn the negative at the earliest opportunity.Eighty years on, the legacy of Brief Encounter has proved anything but. First, its train station setting and ubiquity on British TV led to parodies by everyone from Victoria Wood to Birds Eye ready meals.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Greta Gerwig hascalledit “the most romantic movie ever made”. Its central struggle – the pull of doomed, unconsummated love, of yearning between two people putting responsibility before happiness – has become the template for some of the greatest romantic stories committed to the big screen.Getting there has not been an easy ride. Set in a noirish and literally (if not figuratively) steamy 1930s, the film stars Celia Johnson as Laura - perfectly ordinary, perfectly married, and painfully middle-class. Laid low by a piece of grit in her eye at a train station, she’s attended to by a passing doctor, Alec (Trevor Howard). The pair begin a whirlwind romance – despite their better natures.View image in fullscreen‘Pleasant, but rather stupid’ … Trevor Howard with Everley Gregg (left) and Celia Johnson in Brief Encounter.Photograph: Album/AlamyThough based on Noël Coward’s pre-war 1936 short play, Still Life, Brief Encounter was conceived and shot in the less film-friendly environment of wartime Britain. The changes made from stage to screen would change the story’s soul. A year-long affair would become a seven-week infatuation. A tale of extramarital guilt became one of middle-class self-restraint. It was a sort of wish-fulfilment Lean, for one, could relate to: his accountant father had abandoned his family in similar circumstances 22 years earlier.Location filming in early 1945 was cold but happy, despite the misgivings some were beginning to have over the male lead. Howard was “pleasant, but rather stupid”, Johnson wrote. Lean agreed: “He later became a wonderful actor, but oh dear, there were a lot of things that went straight over his head.”Carnforth railway station – now a Lancashire tourist attraction complete with replica tearoom – stood in for the Home Counties setting, chosen to give the crew time to cover their lamps in the event of a German air raid. Filming was still ongoing when the crew heard the UK’s supply of Technicolor cameras was being diverted to Buckingham Palace – Johnson remembered running to the wireless between takes to hear Winston Churchill announce Germany’s surrender.View image in fullscreenRebuilding British prestige … filming Brief Encounter.Photograph: Album/AlamyThis meant that by the time Brief Encountermade it in front of an audience it was a wartime film, set before the war, playing to a postwar crowd. Perhaps that explains its curiously muted reception: despite critical adoration and Coward’s pedigree as a writer, it did solid but unremarkable business at the UK box office. Posters in the country’s industrial heartlands resorted to singing its praises “in spite of the wild praise of the London critics”.For some, the film came to embody a kind of Britishness now lost in its pre-war origins. Lord Mountbatten, writing to Coward in 1947, said: “There is no doubt in my mind that films of this sort must help to rebuild British prestige which is now temporarily eclipsed.” Months later, Mountbatten oversaw the partition of India, which left the British empire in tatters and as many as two million dead.For others, the film’s story now felt too close to home. The constant wartime movement around the country’s rail network and abroad had triggered any number of “brief encounters” all on its own – affairs without the film’s determination to stay unconsummated. Despite the story’s pre-war setting and conception, it nonetheless now conjured spectres of guilt some audiences would rather have forgotten.Adoration in certain circles, though, kept the Brief Encounter flame alive long after it left cinemas. One of 11 Grand Prix (the predecessor to the Palme d’Or) winners at the 1946 Cannes film festival, it escaped from that year’s Academy Awards with three nominations but no statuettes. The first of Sight & Sound’s now infamous critics’ polls in 1952 placed it a rung above Citizen Kane.View image in fullscreenDavid Lean and Celia Johnson arrive at Paris’s Gare du Nord station en route to pick up their prize at Cannes.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesAnd its reputation among the public grew over time. Lean remembered, coincidentally, waiting for a train when a man approached threatening to punch him. “Do you realise, sir,” Lean recalled he said, “that if Celia Johnson could contemplate being unfaithful to her husband, my wife could contemplate being unfaithful to me?” Divorce still a touchy subject in the UK, Brief Encounter’s popularity would rise as public attitudes liberalised.In the meantime, the film received an indirect boost in the US, where Billy Wilder was feeling inspired by one of Brief Encounter’s smallest characters. Valentine Dyall’s uncredited turn as a man whose empty flat almost serves as the couple’s love nest would morph into a career-best, sad-puppyish turn from Jack Lemmon.View image in fullscreenShooting the film.Photograph: Album/Alamy“I think that the interesting character is the friend who returns to his home and finds the bed still warm,” Wilder said. His more risque American take on forbidden love – 1960’s The Apartment – transplants the story from a social ladder to a corporate one, winning the best picture Oscar for which Brief Encounter had failed to secure a nomination.In the UK, the film’s recurrent place on those newfangled TV schedules meant that, by the 1970s, ad man director Alan Parker could use it to advertise Birds Eye roast beef dinners. Rachmaninov’s Second Piano Concerto – which recurs throughout the film – regularly topped polls as the UK’s favourite piece of classical music, as it continues to do today.Other influences are more subtle. Kazuo Ishiguro’s 1989 Booker prize winner The Remains of the Day bears a striking resemblance to Coward’s dialogue of middle-class repression. Its mid-century butler has internalised the same lessons of duty and propriety to such an extent he may have forgotten how to feel love at all. And the shot-reverse-shot of When Harry Met Sally’s diner scene perfectly mirrors Alec and Laura’s first lunch in a Kardomah cafe, as does the film’s conceit of a relationship built over repeat chance encounters.Following Coward’s death, too, the film’s LGBTQ+ resonances have been brought to the fore. His penchant for packing his scripts with affairs, love triangles and secret crushes had hardly gone unnoticed among the gay community of 1945.View image in fullscreenRe-encounter … Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson in Remains of the Day (1993).Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyDying just six years after homosexuality was first decriminalised in 1967, the writer’s post-mortem exit from the closet only confirmed that the film’s study of forbidden love may have meant something more to its author than the social stigma that scared Alec and Laura into obedience.In the 21st century, Sofia Coppola cited itas an inspiration for her 2003 film Lost in Translation. “You feel so much in just a gesture or a pause,” she said. “It’s so emotional but everything’s under the surface. Maybe that’s very English? But I love that.”Brief Encounter’s ideas have proved more universal than Johnson’s cut-glass accent suggests. Wong Kar-wai’s In the Mood for Love explores similar themes of buttoned-up infidelity, as much about the social pressure imposed on a relationship as the infatuation itself.View image in fullscreenTrain dreams … Teo Yoo and Greta Lee in Past Lives.Photograph: Twenty Years Rights/A24 FilmsCanadian director Celine Song explored its “what if?” question through the Korean concept ofinyeon(the romantic mystery of a sense of connection between two strangers) in her 2023 film, Past Lives. Its opening shot of a love triangle spotted across a bar mirrors Alec and Laura’s last moments together.Today, Brief Encounter holds an odd place in the lives of both Lean and Coward: a tearoom romance from a director famed for his bombastic epics, and the last great film from a writer who never thought much of the medium anyway. Still, of all their works, it might just be the one that’s lasted the longest. For 80 years, we’ve never been able to stop asking: “What if?”The National Film Theatre, London, hosts an 80th anniversary screening of Brief Encounter on 16 NovemberThis article was amended on 4 November 2025 because in an earlier version, the caption to the second picture said the person on the left was Joyce Carey, when it is a different actor in Brief Encounter, Everley Gregg.Explore more on these topicsDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How can this rot be real? If I recreated the idea in my local park, I’d surely end up in prisonHannah J DaviesTue 4 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 03.01 ESTShareThere’s missing the point, and then there’s Netflix making its capitalism-skewing Korean hit about a ruthless contest intoan actual gameshow.The producers of Squid Game: The Challenge have previouslydenied that’s what happened here, stating that, in fact, the series is also about camaraderie and how people work under pressure, and is, I quote, “a critique of how we are ingrained from childhood to be ultra-competitive”. Come on – it’s a reality show about people doing humiliating things because they’re desperate for money, based on a drama about people doing humiliating things because they’re desperate for money. If I rounded up a load of debt-ridden people and recreated Squid Game: The Challenge in my local park, I’m pretty sure I’d be put in prison.The thing about Squid Game: The Challenge that makes it all OK (although really, none of it is OK) is that everyone here is completely mesmerised by the amount of money on offer. Its prize is among the largest in gameshow history, with the winner of series one, Mai Whelan, cashing a cheque for an extremely cool $4.56m (£3.47m). It’s the sort of money that makes people go gaga from the off, and the treachery is off the charts.For series two, they’ve made it meaner than ever, with the twists coming in thicker and faster and the sob stories more abject. If there was a brief moment in series one where it felt as if maybe this whole “critique” thing was, perhaps, not a clear bid to have one’s cake and eat it, that moment has definitely passed.The undoubted stars of this first batch of episodes (Netflix will release another lot on 11 November, before the finale on the 18th) are British twins and TikTok personalities Jacob and Raul Gibson. The Gibsons, AKA players 431 and 432, are charming schemers who have the other betracksuited competitors under their spell during a challenge to count 456 seconds exactly – that is, until they eliminate three other players to keep themselves in the game. People are outraged as the losers fall to the ground in mock-death but, well, there’s $4.56m dollars on the line here, guys!View image in fullscreenNever has a fun pastime been so unpleasant to watch … Squid Game: The Challenge.Photograph: NetflixLike The Traitors – which is made by the same production company, Studio Lambert – Squid Game: The Challenge has a dark campiness to it (at a pivotal moment in episode one, Nina Simone’s Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood plays, cocking a snook at the players’ differing tactics and opinions). But unlike The Traitors, Squid Game: The Challenge doesn’t always feel like fun. Sure, watching someone assemble a house of cards should be low-stakes enough. But when that person is physically shaking, sweat pouring off their face like water running from a tap, while their team’s chances of staying in the game are on the line? Not so much. Never has catching a ball in a cup been so urgent – or so unpleasant to watch.Perhaps, as viewers, we’re supposed to find the “critique” in just how quickly players turn on one another, using words like “dorky” and, er, “fraudalent” to describe each other, and judging who should stay or go based on what they would use the prize money for (leukaemia research – good! Yacht party – bad!). People say things like “it’s just a game” while gritting their teeth in a way that says “this is very muchnotjust a game”. There is the occasional air of theStanford Prison Experiment, and seeing how quickly power corrupts.But I feel all of this is giving Squid Game: The Challenge far too much credit. The last episode of this batch, Mingle, is particularly grim, and is based on a game from the original drama that was described as one of its most brutal and upsetting. At the very least, it will be very triggering for anyone who was ever picked last in PE.For a brief moment, I do consider whether Squid Game: The Challenge could be so bad that it is good, but I think that would be letting its makers off too lightly. The way many of its contestants conduct themselves is dreadful, but then again, this is a dreadful contest. Still, I don’t blame the people who signed up to win $4.56m. Don’t hate the player – hate the utterly grotty game.Squid Game: The Challenge is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewSquid GameGame showsTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sure, they might bedeck their album sleeves with ghouls, goblins, manacled maidens and brawny barbarians, but did a member of Cirith Ungol ever have to retrieve a missing unicorn horn from a snowy field in the depths of winter? Has Yngwie Malmsteen spent time squinting in the back of a tour bus, repairing his own chainmail?Formed in 2019, Brooklyn’s Castle Rat have had to face both these scenarios and more as they live out their epic fantasies. From heraldic, earworm-heavy anthems to eye-popping live shows, costume design, videos and album art, they’re not so much a metal band as a full immersive experience.“Castle Rat wasn’t meant to be a costumed concept band,” says singer, guitarist, sword-wielder and creative overlord Riley Pinkerton as the band’s tour van speeds from a sold-out gig in Cologne to another in Aschaffenburg – they’re also doing five gigs in the UK this week. “We played two shows and got booked on a Halloween gig, where I made a last-minute decision to dress up. It was all super-DIY, but we had so much fun and the feeling in the room was electric. I thought, ‘What if we could have this much fun every time?’”Since then, the band – which features Pinkerton as the “Rat Queen” alongside a plague doctor (Charley Ruddell, bass), haughty vampire (Franco Vittore, guitar) and mysterious druid (Joshua Strmic, drums) – haven’t looked back. The Bestiary, the band’s second album, conjures visions ofBlack Sabbath,Iron Maidenand Manowar joining forces to battle their way through a Frank Frazetta fantasy world – a heroic opus that places them on the brink of far grander things.The Bestiary was a first for Pinkerton in that she opened the floor to her bandmates. “It made it a lot stronger,” she says of the collaborative process. “I struggled at first – I’d always felt a certain amount of pride being a woman in music going it alone. There’ve been so many times where I’ve got off stage and some guy will say, ‘Those guys write great riffs!’ and I’m like, ‘Hey –Iwrote all that.’”As the band’s stature has grown, so has the scope of their production design. “My motto is always that if it’s worth doing, it’s worthoverdoing,” Pinkerton laughs. She was originally on course for a fine art degree before balking at the prospect of so much debt. “The fun thing about Castle Rat is there’s so many different ways to apply artistic expression,” she says. “Whether it’s making masks, costume design, learning how to edit music videos … it’s all stuff I don’t know how to do, but it’s fun to figure it out on the fly.”As if building the band’s intricate lore (“Everyone’s urging me to write it down because it’s all in here,” Riley says, tapping her head) and stitching garments wasn’t enough, the singer taught herself how to make chainmail – no mean feat, though she admittedly left her all-new scalemail look to a New York-based specialist. “It feels like actualarmour,” she beams.View image in fullscreen‘There’s not an alternative version of the show where I don’t have a sword’ … Riley Pinkerton.Photograph: Peter BesteAs for audiences? They took to the fake blood, foam swords and papier-mache rat skulls with as much gusto as the band. “We played a show in Detroit and it looked like a Renaissance fair,” recalls Riley fondly. “Everyone was in cloaks, sheepskin, chainmail.”This isn’t to say, however, that life on the road as sword’n’sorcery vagabonds has been plain sailing. “Everything is constantly breaking and ends up duct-taped together,” Riley says. “Plus I’ll have endless ideas as to how I want things to look, but we’re travelling in a van with only so much space. It’s an interesting challenge to make it feel like a larger-than-life story, then pack it down into nothing.”There have been other logistical problems that would never have plagued Conan the Cimmerian or Dark Agnes de Chastillon. “We did have an ‘oh shit’ moment when we played SonicBlast festival in Portugal and my luggage – which had my sword in it – got lost,” says Riley. “That was a worst-case scenario, because there’s not an alternative version of the show where I don’t have a sword.”Like a true warrior queen, Riley is gung-ho about the future. “I want to go all the way – let’s do stadiums,” she says. “The only thing that’s really important to me is keeping the DIY aesthetic, making sure everything is handmade. That’s an element I want to keep true, no matter what we scale to. Oh, and I want to ride out on a unicorn every night. You know howRob Halforddoes the motorcycle thing? That, but with a unicorn.”Castle Rat’s UK tour commences at Concorde 2, Brighton, on 4 November.Explore more on these topicsMetalPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Weighing in at more than 1,200 pages of closely printed text, the novel contains, I would hazard, about half a million words – roughly two Ulysses. It’s also, for that matter, about twice the length of Danielewski’s debut,House of Leaves, which secured cult status for its author on publication 25 years ago. Tom’s Crossing is so big that when I got it out on the tube, I felt like that character on Trigger Happy TV with his enormous mobile phone. “Look,” I seemed to be telling the passengers scrolling Instagram on their devices, “I’m reading a book!”The novel is not merely long, it’s also a challenging, deliberately arcane work that insists on its own epic status, yet has at its heart a straightforward and compelling story. Kalin March, a 16-year-old nerdy outsider in the town of Orvop in Utah, is a preternaturally talented horse rider. Through a shared love of horses, he strikes up an unlikely friendship with handsome and popular Tom Gatestone.When Tom dies of cancer, he extracts a promise from Kalin to save the two horses they love from the knacker’s yard. The bulk of the novel tells the story of Kalin’s quest to take these horses, Mouse and Navidad, to safety in the wilderness beyond the Isatch mountain range. Along the way, Kalin is joined unexpectedly by Tom’s plucky adopted little sister Landry and, even more unexpectedly, by Tom’s ghost. A violent series of events raises the stakes: the evil Orvop patriarch, Orwin Porch, owner of Porch Meats, and mortal enemy of the Gatestones, sets off to foil Kalin’s already difficult mission.There are so many choric figures that I wondered if they belonged to Danielewski superfans who had crowdfunded the novelThis bald summary doesn’t do justice to the ambition of the book or the brilliance of its plotting. The events take place over a five-day period leading up to Halloween, 1982. Purely as story, Tom’s Crossing hits a western-inflected cinematic sweet spot, with a 1980s setting, young central characters and sweeping landscapes. There are guns, horses, ghosts, a primal struggle for survival in hostile terrain, family feuds and a steadily intensifying sense of mortal threat, as Old Porch’s ambition and psychopathy escalate the drama. And the compressed timeframe of the story ticks down to a hugely satisfying climactic encounter in the mountains.And yet, for all its obvious virtues, I found Tom’s Crossing a baffling and often infuriating experience. Danielewski is a writer of enormous power and vision. He has invented a gripping story with mythic undertones that need no extra emphasis. Yet he makes a number of aesthetic choices that seem deliberately designed to frustrate normal enjoyment of the novel. One of these is the conceit, established on page one, that the epic events described in the book are already widely known. At umpteen points in the novel, we cut away from the action and explore the thoughts and attitudes of a vast chorus of named characters who have used moments in the story as the basis for their own artworks: opera, songs, sculptures, drawings, art installations. We hear about these in mindboggling detail. There are so many of these choric figures – at one point, a thousand or so names are simply listed in the text without comment – that I wondered if they belonged to Danielewski superfans who had crowdfunded the novel.The other decision that struck me as perverse is the narrative voice of the book. The novel purports to be the transcription of an oral account of the events it relates. The voice reproduced on the page is a weird mixture of Homeric and hayseed, dropping terminal “g” on participles, using double negatives, now and again renderingforasfer, yet conversant with arcane words such as cynegetic, rupestral, epicrisis, noctilucent and teichoskopia. The result is prolix and wandering and makes a long book feel much longer.“Earlier that afternoon, when for some reason Allison’s thoughts had angrily returned to the curse she’d laid upon Kalin before he’d left, warnin him from guns, makin it clear by insubstantial decree that even handlin a gun might cost him the horses he loved, and for the rest of his life, she and Sondra had returned to the Isatch Canyon parkin lot, where they’d promptly learned about the great rockfall.”This passage is one of the shorter and less challenging sections of the novel, but there’s still something characteristically inconsiderate about the way it’s constructed. The warning about the guns – though pertinent to the plot – has nothing to do with the unfolding action. In fact, it just distracts the reader from the essence of this paragraph which is:Allison and Sondra went back to the Canyon and learned about the rockfall.Why not say it like that? Well, the narrator’s voice is committed to its special idiolect, with repetition, slang and its own winding rhythms. Space prevents me quoting the weirdest examples at length, but at times it reads as though the Stranger from the film The Big Lebowski is channelling the brambly 17th-century prose of John Milton or Thomas Browne. The Stranger, you’ll remember, has a gravelly voice and a big hat, and is prone to saying things such as: “I guess that’s the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin itself down through the generations. Westward the wagons, across the sands of time, until we – ah! Look at me, I’m ramblin again.” Throw in a reference to the Iliad and an obscure adjective, say, quaquaversal, and this is basically the voice of Tom’s Crossing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There is deep knowledge about – off the top of my head – horse riding, geography, geology, myth, Mormon scripture, card games, land development, 1980s music, modern art, guns, outdoor survival and the conventions of classical literature. Furthermore, every moment in the story is exploded into second-by-second detail, irrespective of its importance to the plot. On occasions, this is sublime and thrilling. Danielewski’s ability to visualise and convey unfolding action is amazing. At other times, I was scratching my head as we disappeared down another extended digression, wondering why I was being told so much about minor characters and their irrelevant enthusiasms.In the end, Tom’s Crossing feels as though it’s been written with at least one eye on the literary immortality bestowed by academic study. Its aesthetic decisions seem designed to stimulate seminars rather than enjoyment. And to be fair, Danielewski doesn’t hide the book’s challenges: a glance at the novel’s first page will let readers know what they’re in for. Less obvious is that beneath the carapace of difficult writing and literary allusion, there’s the gratifying gooey centre of a blockbuster PG western, with limited nudity, violent scenes and oddly simple moral choices.Tom’s Crossing by Mark Z Danielewski is published by Pantheon (£30).

So why are they so terrifying?Jonathan JonesTue 4 Nov 2025 12.22 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 15.24 ESTShareHe looks like he’s up to no good. In the depths of the night, under trees and clouds turned silver and black by the full moon, a man is at work with a shovel. Is he burying a body or digging bits up for a Frankensteinian experiment? After all, this painting was done by Joseph Wright of Derby, a friend of pioneering scientists and industrialists in the Lunar Society of Birmingham, leaders of the new science that would inspire Mary Shelley.But the man beside the foaming river Derwent is not collecting body parts. He’s doing something just as nefarious by 21st-century moral standards: blocking a fox den so the foxes can’t get back in and will be easy game for the hunt tomorrow. Maybe Wright shares my compassion for foxes, because An Earthstopper on the Banks of the Derwent genuinely is a bit sinister. Yet it has a hypnotic beauty. Two light sources – a lantern and the moon – make this night anything but dead as we almost hear leaves rustle, white water rush and the earthstopper’s spade clunk. It’s one thing to paint a landscape by day. Wright makes one come fantastically alive by night.The National Gallery’s close look at Wright’s paintings of darkness and illumination reveals him as the first gothic artist. The gothic novel was invented when Horace Walpole published The Castle of Otranto in 1764; Wright painted his journeys into the horrors of the night in the 1760s and 70s. But the bloodcurdling secret at the heart of these paintings is scientific not supernatural.View image in fullscreenBloodcurdling secrets … Earthstopper on the Banks of the Derwent, 1773, by Joseph Wright of Derby.Photograph: © Derby MuseumsInA Philosopher by Lamplight, two young travellers have found more than they bargained for. Stumbling over a moonlit stream to a cave lit by a lonely candle, they look in terror upon an old man playing with a skeleton, lifting a bony leg as its skull stares from hollow eyes. The hermit is a philosopher trying to puzzle out what happens when we die. But the answer is nothing. For as science took hold in 18th-century Europe as a way of rationally understanding nature, God might be dead, according to radical minds like Wright of Derby’s friend Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles.InThe Blacksmith’s Shop, the glowing metal on which the blacksmith is working lights up a ruinous building: the workshop is inside a classical temple with Corinthian pilasters. This is an unmistakable reference to Renaissance paintings of the nativity where the stable is often a dilapidated Roman temple, symbolising the death of paganism and rise of Christianity. What can it represent here except the modern material world being born in turn from Christianity’s wreckage?Open your eyes to the nature of the universe, the true magic of science, urges this artist of Enlightenment in his spectacular canvasA Philosopher Giving That Lecture on the Orrery in which a Lamp Is Put in Place of the Sun. The National Gallery provides a real orrery, a mechanical model of the solar system, for comparison.View image in fullscreenDifferent scales … A Philosopher Giving That Lecture on the Orrery in Which a Lamp Is Put in Place of the Sun, 1764-1766, by Joseph Wright of Derby.Photograph: Joseph Wright of Derby/© Derby MuseumsOne reason Wright’s painted orrery is so bewitching is that you see it at different scales from the perspectives of the audience gathered round the model in a shadowy library. Go close to the enthralled faces of the children and it seems vast; stand further back and it’s a scientific toy, small compared with the lecturer and the gentleman beside him who assiduously takes notes. The scientist looks at him sceptically; a woman in a hat and jewels seems a little blank-eyed. Compared with the children, these adults are less electrified by curiosity.Maybe shock tactics are needed. Wright’s Orrery, like other paintings here from the superb collection of his work at Derby Museum, is reunited with his other great science spectacle, the National Gallery’sAn Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump.Painted two years after his Orrery, it shifts the focus from wonder to dread. One girl hides her face, too appalled to look – for the lecturer is about to create a vacuum in a glass chamber, killing the white cockatoo inside.Wright gives this experiment hard-edged reality. It’s the summit of his use of light cutting through darkness to define objects and spaces. The machine at the heart of the action is a formidable structure, its wooden column and brass fittings suggesting the steam engines being perfected by Lunar Society members. In the immortal words of the society’s co-founder Matthew Boulton: “I sell here, Sir, what all the world desires to have: power!”The audience in Wright’s painting includes members of the local gentry in a Georgian country house, but the power is not in their hands. It is a new kind of power possessed by the scientist. This 18th-century Oppenheimer gazes at us as he prepares to crank the handle, kill the bird, detonate the bomb. Wright isn’t rejecting science but intuiting that it will change these people’s world – and ours – as surely as that bird will die. Candlelight from behind fills a glass vessel with liquid light as if it were radioactive, illuminating a human skull. This is meant to be a rational exposition of the vacuum, but has become a nightmarish theatre of science, power, cruelty and death. Perhaps the youngest girl, who can’t take her eyes from the horror, is plotting a gothic novel of her own.Wright of Derby: From the Shadows is atthe National Gallery, London, from 7 November to 10 MayExplore more on these topicsArtNational GalleryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Talk about setting the tone.Ethel Smyth’s Der Wald (premiered in Berlin in 1902) and Ottorino Respighi’s Lucrezia – first performed in 1937 although this, remarkably, was its UK premiere – will have been new to most in the Silk Street theatre. Yet both scores could have “RW woz ’ere” graffitied on them, such is Wagner’s impact on their musical language.Der Waldveers into total fandom. Here’s a dark, Romantic forest inhabited by innocent lovers. There’s a dramatic soprano wreaking social havoc. “Tod und Liebe” – death and love – sings the female innocent at the end in her own miniature Liebestod. InStephen Barlow’s production, the lighting is set at “gloomy” and the action is in 1950s North America, the woodlanders clad in denim and plaid while Iolanthe the pseudo-Valkyrie arrives on a motorbike.View image in fullscreenPalpably having fun: Ethel Smyth’s Der WaldPhotograph: David Monteith-HodgeThe cast was palpably having fun. The chorus and smaller roles were an energetic, vibrant presence, Sonny Fielding’s turn as the peddler andRedmond Sanders’ as local landowner Rudolf (here an all-mouth-and-trousers cowboy) especially persuasive.Avery Lafrentzmanoeuvred her huge, hard-edged soprano effectively as Iolanthe, Harry Jacques was a warm, sympathetic Heinrich andSeohyun Gowas excellent as his fiancee Röschen, her tone both generous and carefully controlled. If the impassioned climax of the opera’s love duet felt underheated as Röschen took off her cardigan, it was partly down to the orchestra, conducted byDominic Wheeler. The lush string tone of the opening never quite returned and, despite some shapely woodwind solos, the playing lacked the polish and amplitude needed to make this opera truly compelling.The orchestra fared better in Respighi’s Lucrezia, where Wagner lurks behind the twin filters of Puccini andStraussin a score that embraces extremes of harshness and beauty. There were moments of tactile earthiness from the cellos and basses, terrifying, febrile activity in the woodwind and hefty slabs of brass, while the strings eked out slow, traumatised drags as the heroine (better known to operagoers viaBrittenand to classicists viaLivy and Ovid) narrates how she had been raped.Barlow’s staging places the ever-shocking plot in a modern US courtroom, the men in suits and sandals, the women in toga-like dresses. Gabriella Giulietta Noble demonstrated a gift for storytelling as La Voce (here a black-suited legal professional providing periodic commentary), while Manon Ogwen Parry’s Venilia and Hannah McKay’s Lucrezia stood out from the impressive cast in their assured dramatic and vocal intensity. It was a powerful argument for a work we should clearly know better.Further performances on 5, 7 and 10 November,Silk Street theatre, Barbican, LondonExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

The luscious pale yellow walls of the first two galleries immediately immerse you in what Ancher is most known for: her remarkably radical practice of painting light.Ancher was born Anna Brøndum in 1859 and raised in Skagen, a wild region at the northern tip of Denmark known for its windswept beaches, ethereal light and wild seas. The area became a destination for artists in the late 19th century, one of whom, Michael Ancher, became Anna’s husband. Her exposure to working artists from her early teenage years put her on the path to becoming an artist herself, something that her parents and future husband both, unusually, unequivocally supported. She became part of what was eventually known as theSkagen Painters; as the only member who was actually from Skagen, her work had a depth of connection to place unmatched by her peers.View image in fullscreenAnna Ancher, Sunlight in the blue room, 1891. Oil on canvas.Photograph: Image courtesy of Skagens MuseumRather than being a rehabilitation of a “forgotten” woman artist, this exhibition is a long overdue introduction to British audiences of one of the most famous artists in Denmark to this day. Ancher was never lost to art history the way that many 19th-century women were, but her international reputation (and that of her peers in the Skagen Group) has never been as great as she deserves. Part of the “modern breakthrough” movement in Scandinavian art, Ancher and her friends strove to paint what they termed the truth, shedding the confines of the academic tradition – which was still inaccessible to women in Denmark, in any case.She spent time in Paris in the 1880s, where she and her husband were exposed to the work of the impressionists, which greatly influenced her own approach to painting. But her work is unique in its particular devotion to the tones of light that flooded her very northern home, from pale butter to rich gold and bloody rose. Her assured, smooth brushstrokes trace her gestures across each canvas, with textured, layered impasto marks building up a tactile, staccato pattern of light crossing a room. Most of her works depict her home or that of other members of the Skagen community. In revisiting the same spaces again and again, she was able to experiment with form and material, particularly through depicting the repetitive pattern of light coming through window panes.Some of the most moving works here are Ancher’s paintings of her mother, Ane Møller Brøndum, a paradoxical figure who was both part of a conservative Christian sect and also deeply supportive of her daughter’s determination to pursue an artistic career. In one, her shawl-swathed figure dissolves into abstracted tones of red and eventually into raw canvas. In another, she leans over the coffin of her daughter Agnes, drenched in shadow while Agnes is almost completely washed out in white, two chromatic poles in a portrait of grief. And finally, she lies on her own deathbed, painted with such profound tenderness by the daughter who had cared for, and been cared for by her, all her life.View image in fullscreenA Field Sermon, 1903.Photograph: Courtesy of Skagens Museum.The exhibition makes clear just how dependent Ancher’s success was on her vast support system. Her parents, extended family, husband and network of friends encouraged her, helped with childcare for her daughter Helga, and generally did not blink at her refusal to follow many of her female peers in giving up painting to focus on the roles of wife and mother.The rather small, narrow galleries that form the temporary exhibition space at Dulwich Picture Gallery lend themselves well to work like Ancher’s, which is relatively small-scale and intimate. Her paintings hit a sweet spot of being both radical but legible, crowd-pleasing but novel, foreign but familiar.Leaving the exhibition, one wonders how one had avoided her work for so long. It is extraordinarily beautiful, propelling viewers to look more closely both at the paintings in front of them and at their own everyday spaces. Perhaps we could all find as much to see as Anna Ancher did.Anna Ancher: Painting Lightis at Dulwich Picture gallery, London, until 8 March.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtDulwich Picture GalleryExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

She described Hollinghurst as “one of the most daring, stylish, witty, humane and influential novelists writing in the English language today”.Hollinghurst told the Guardian he was “overcome with emotion” on hearing of his win. “It has always, to my mind, been the most significant British literary prize.” The award, often described as the UK and Ireland’s Nobel in literature, is awarded biennially to a writer from either country for their entire body of work.“It takes account of everything a writer has done, and the writers it has rewarded in the past have been huge inspirations,” he said. “I went nearly 30 years ago to the ceremony to see Muriel Spark receiving the award, and later Harold Pinter – these figures are godlike to me, and it’s extraordinary now to find myself joining that list.” Winning “feels to me like the greatest encouragement to keep going,” he added.Hollinghurst, 71, is best known for his Booker prize-winning 2004 novel The Line of Beauty, a social and sexual panorama of Thatcher-era London that has been adapted into a stage production which opened last month at London’s Almeida theatre. His other works include The Swimming-Pool Library (1988), The Folding Star (1994),The Stranger’s Child(2011) andOur Evenings(2024). He was knighted for services to literature earlier this year.Lee praised Hollinghurst’s “pioneering boldness and candour” in writing about gay lives and English identity over nearly four decades.Alan Hollinghurst: ‘I wrote letters to my schoolfriends in dwarfish runes’Read more“In seven remarkable novels,” she said, “he has written about society, class and race, biography and memory, art and literature, childhood, love and friendship. He’s equally brilliant at creating gripping plots full of suspense, secrets and mysteries, and at moving personal stories of longing, joy, obsession and loss.”Lee was joined on the judging panel by the novelist Tessa Hadley, poet Seán Hewitt, critic Maya Jaggi and biographer Ruth Scurr. Hadley said Hollinghurst “makes the reader see some solid thing – a room, a face, a landscape – with thrilling exactness”, while Hewitt praised his “vivid, elegant novels of gay English life that have changed the way we see ourselves”.“From the start, I set out to write about gay life in England,” said Hollinghurst. “I just felt very lucky, in the 1980s, to have this whole fascinating field of social history and behaviour to explore in fiction, because it hadn’t really been done in this country before.”His most recent novel, Our Evenings, was praised for its portrayal of a mixed-race narrator in contemporary Britain, a perspective Hollinghurst said he approached with care.“It gave me pause,” he said. “I’d been wanting to write about racial discrimination for some time, but it was a question of how to look at it and find a way that was tactful and true.”He added that he is working on a new novel, though he is “at a very early stage. I’ve always been horribly slow with formulation – about every seven years I produce something.”As part of the David Cohen tradition, the winner also selects the recipient of the Clarissa Luard award, a £10,000 prize for emerging talent the winner wishes to support. Hollinghurst chose the Congolese-British playwrightBenedict Lombe, whose play Shifters moved from the Bush theatre to the West End this year, earning her two Olivier nominations.“Shifters was the best new play that I saw last year,” Hollinghurst said. “I saw it at the Bush theatre before it transferred, it was so remarkable. I long for her next play, and I thought she was an obvious person to give this award and encouragement to.”“It’s an honour and a joy to have my work recognised and championed by such an accomplished – and exquisite – storyteller as Alan,” said Lombe. “At a time when many voices are being silenced and funding is being cut, this award is a precious thing indeed.”First presented in 1993 and named after its founder, the David Cohen prize celebrates writers whose work has made a lasting contribution to British and Irish literature. Previous winners include Seamus Heaney, Hilary Mantel and Colm Tóibín.Explore more on these topicsAlan HollinghurstFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

Now she’s made an acclaimed film taking aim at this Taiwanese superstitionTue 4 Nov 2025 10.46 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 13.09 ESTShareThe teenage Shih-Ching Tsou was at home in Taipei cooking a meal one day when she picked up a knife with her left hand. “My grandfather told me the left hand is the devil’s hand. He said: ‘You should not use that.’” Up until then, the Taiwanese-American film-maker hadn’t even realised she was left-handed. “I was already ‘corrected’, probably in kindergarten, by the teacher.”That conversation – and the lingering sense of shame – stayed with her, Tsou says. She spoke to her mother about it. “She told me she was left-handed too and got corrected” – forced to use her right hand – “because at the time, they said you had to do the same as other people.”View image in fullscreen‘I was very rebellious’ … Shih-Ching Tsou.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images for BFIDecades later, she has turned that childhood incident into a scene in her new film, Left-Handed Girl, which follows a sweet-natured Taiwanese five-year-old, I-Jing (Nina Ye), grappling with what she believes to be her own “devil’s hand”. Her mother, Shu-Fen (Janel Tsai), a noodle stall owner, is struggling with money problems while I-Jing’s rebellious older sister, I-Ann (Shih-Yuan Ma), is dealing with the fallout from an affair with her married boss. I-Jing starts to shoplift, her left hand taking on a sinful life of its own.Tsou found Nina, who started acting in commercials when she was three, through a casting director friend. “When I cast her, she was six, so she was really experienced,” says the director over a video call from the Zurich film festival. “She knows exactly what to do in front of the camera.” She was surprised to find out that her young star had also been left-handed but had been corrected by her grandmother. “We had to retrain her to use her left hand. When I heard, I was like, ‘Oh, my God, this still exists.’”Shot entirely on iPhones, Left-Handed Girl is a raw and empathic story about family secrets, resilience and the struggles of being an Asian woman in a society that still prizes sons over daughters. Tsou recounts how she once went back to Taiwan for the annual Qingming festival, where families clean their ancestors’ graves. “My mother was talking only about my brother, because she thinks I’m already married off, so I’m not part of the family any more. That’s very traditional thinking.”Tsou grew up in Taipei and moved to New York to do a master’s. “I actually moved out of my parents’ home when I was 14 so I was used to being alone,” she says, explaining how she left after getting into fights with her “very strict” dad. “I was very rebellious. I would talk back.” Emigrating to the US years later, she was glad to get away from what she calls the “limitations” of Taiwanese society. “I have darker skin,” she says, gesturing to her arm. “But they expect girls to have pale skin to be considered pretty.” In the summer, she would avoid wearing short sleeves. “Because my mum would say, ‘You don’t want to get tanned.’”It was at the New School that she metSean Baker, the Oscar-winning Anora director, who was then a fellow student. She brought up her experience of being left-handed in Taiwan. “That was actually the very first idea I wanted to make into a film.” The pair bonded over their love of Dogme 95 films and Korean cinema.Tsou went on to co-direct, co-write and co-produce her first film with him, 2004’s Take Out, a gritty look at the life of an illegal Chinese immigrant. Since then Tsou has worked on many of Baker’s films as a producer, including Tangerine andThe Florida Projectas well as taking on other roles on set such as costume designer and even making the odd cameo. She co-wrote the script for Left-Handed Girl, her first solo feature as a director, with Baker, who also edited and co-produced the film.The script was finished in 2010, but the pair struggled to get funding. Tsou found working on Baker’s films “so fulfilling” that she didn’t have much urge to follow up Take Out. She is also a busy mum. “I want to spend as much time as I can with my daughter, because once she turns [into a] teenager, she will probably never talk to me again.”Left-Handed Girl has been a hit on the festival circuit since it premiered at Cannes, and has been selected as Taiwan’s submission for best international feature film at the Oscars. Tsou has been approached by many left-handed people who have told her how they, too, had been corrected. Returning to Taiwan this summer to see her family, she met up with Nina’s mother, who said that the actor’s grandmother had a change of heart. “She said: ‘OK, I don’t want to correct you any more.’ So Nina got her left hand back.”Tsou hopes that the film will help to clear away the absurd superstitions that still persist. “I want people to watch the film and think: is there any outdated tradition I should reinvent to create a new one that’s fair to everybody?” As a plea for change, Left-Handed Girl is a gentle one, but it takes hold and doesn’t let go.Left-Handed Girl is released in the UK on 14 November and on Netflix from 28 NovemberExplore more on these topicsFilmTaiwanDrama filmsSean BakerAnoraThe Florida ProjectTangerineinterviewsShareReuse this content"

They have allocated £285,000 in funding since starting out.View image in fullscreenAssembly member Rudy, 70, a volunteer support worker, making a point at a progress report meeting.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian“Without citizens and community around the table shaping the direction and showing the horizon, we would quickly become an average organisation,” says Saad Eddine Said, chief executive and artistic director at NAE, which is the UK’s largest gallery dedicated to African, Caribbean and south Asian artists.“This neighbourhood is such a huge treasure of culture and of talent so we wanted it to play a key role, not just in terms of consultancy, but in real terms of coleadership.”A street gallery outside the building, designed to entice people in, was removed after assembly members said it was intimidating and off-putting, and more money was invested in making the cafe a welcoming space that would bring people through the door instead.After reporting that a major problem in the area was a lack of places to socialise on a Friday evening, NAE started hosting socials, such as poetry and DJ events, which draw large crowds.“We believe in [the assembly] and we don’t want it to become just a trendy thing, just ticking boxes,” says Said. “Removing the street gallery felt counterintuitive to us. But straight away that street gallery was in the bin, and in the bin for ever.View image in fullscreenThe cafe area at the New Art Exchange. The citizens’ assembly made the cafe a welcoming space that would bring people through the door.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian“It didn’t matter whether we understood it. There is no compromise in that conversation.”Adam Roe, the gallery’s executive director, says: “I’ve been asked: ‘Do you think that you’ve lost power as a result of this?’“Actually, I think I’ve gained power. Collectively, we’ve got so much more knowledge because we’re doing the things we know we need to do.“And some of the artists and the performers we work with now we probably would never have known about before.”Citizens’ assemblies have long been used in local democracy and public policy to gauge national opinion, but in recent years they have spread into other sectors – and cultural institutions are the latest to try using them.In August, the National Gallery announced it was creating a citizens’ assembly of 50 people from across the UK who will make recommendations that will be built on by a smaller citizens’ panel over the next five years.Birmingham Museum &ArtGallery recruited a citizens’ jury in 2024 which published several recommendations, including later opening times and promoting the work of young people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She brought an authentic, undiluted American screen-acting flavour to everything she was in, and ran hugely successful movie and TV careers in parallel for decades, playing waitresses, neighbours, moms, sirens and daughters, and ranging from comedy to drama.She was famously the mother of screen actor Laura Dern and wife of Bruce Dern, and repeatedly acted with Laura in a remarkable mother-daughter partnership in which the two women’s closeness always shone through. You might compare it to Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli, or Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher — although Diane Ladd and Laura Dern were far more trouble-free and without that kind of angst. They were Oscar-nominated together for their joint appearance in Martha Coolidge’s Depression drama Rambling Rose from 1991. And they also both appeared in David Lynch’s Wild at Heart and Inland Empire, Alexander Payne’s Citizen Ruth, and in Mike White’s HBO drama Enlightened – and in three of these they played, naturally, a mother and daughter. In Joel Hershman’s 1992 comedy Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Ladd acted alongside her own mother, the stage actor Mary Lanier.View image in fullscreenMother-daughter partnership … Ladd (left) with Laura Dern in Rambling Rose.Photograph: Carolco/Rambling Rose/Midnight Sun/Kobal/ShutterstockShe had a minor but potent, mysterious part in Polanski’s Chinatown as Ida Sessions, the woman who has posed as Faye Dunaway’s character Evelyn as part of a sinister conspiracy. But more prominent was her role in the classic and time-honoured role as the brassy, heart-of-gold diner waitress in Martin Scorsese’s Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore – playing a slightly different part in the TV spinoff – whose job is to deliver down-home banter and hard-won unimpressed wisdom with Ellen Burstyn’s Alice and to be the witness of the latter’s budding romance with Kris Kristofferson. In Bill Duke’s silver-years comedy The Cemetery Club from 1993, Ladd was reunited with Ellen Burstyn and Olympia Dukakis, to play one of three widowed women who are determined to get some enjoyment out of life.But it was perhaps Ladd’s destiny to play more in an intergenerational context, portraying older characters and mothers and sisters, in various comic or forbidding forms. In Bob Rafelson’s Black Widow she was the sister of one of the murderer’s black-widow predations; in National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation she was Chevy Chase’s mom; and in Mike Nichols’ Primary Colors she was the mother of John Travolta’s Clintonesque Governor Jack Stanton.View image in fullscreenLadd in Wild at Heart.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyDavid Lynch tapped into the sharpness, the astringency and the darkness within or behind the all-American veneer that Ladd could present to the camera. In Wild at Heart (opposite Laura Dern), she got one of her three Oscar nominations in the very sensual role of Marietta, who conceives a sexually ambiguous resentment against her daughter’s association with the smouldering Sailor (Nicolas Cage) and tries different ways to sabotage their relationship and murder him. In Lynch’s far more complex and experimental Inland Empire, again of course with Dern, she plays the host of a TV celebrity gossip show which is very preoccupied with Dern’s actor character: again, Ladd is vivid, cartoony, but not satirical or grotesque; she is an effortlessly Lynchian character.Explore more on these topicsFilmLaura DernDavid LynchMartin ScorsesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The new Watch SE 3 costs from £219 (€269/$249/A$399), making it one of the cheapest brand-new fully fledged smartwatches available for the iPhone and undercutting the £369Series 11and the top-of-the-line £749Apple Watch Ultra 3.The Watch SE line is updated only every few years and has been good value but was missingsome crucial thingsthat make Apple’s other watches great. The Watch SE 3’s biggest upgrade is an always-on display, which brings it up to par with the Series line, allowing you to see the time and notifications at a glance without having to twist your wrist to turn the screen on.View image in fullscreenThe screen on and active with the flow watch face (left) and in its idle always-on position (right) with the time still visible.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe SE 3 has the older Apple Watch design from 2020’sSeries 6with smaller screens, larger bezels and a choice of 40mm or 44mm case sizes compared with the current Series watches. The screen is also not quite as bright as the more expensive watches, but that is noticeable only in bright direct sunlight. It is still sharp and good looking.The SE 3 has the same S10 chip as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, and is just as responsive. It also has the same excellent touch-free gestures, including double tap and wrist flick, which allow you to dismiss notifications, timers and alarms easily.The watch also supports all the rest of the general Apple Watch features inwatchOS 26, including Apple Pay contactless payments, rich notifications, music control, third-party apps and a range of watch faces.View image in fullscreenThe SE 3 runs all the same apps and services as its more expensive siblings.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery life of the SE 3 is a little shorter than the Series 11, lasting about a day and a half of general use, including sleep tracking overnight. Most will have to charge it every other day, particularly if they track any workouts. The SE 3 will last up to seven hours of running tracking with GPS and heart rate, which should be long enough for a marathon. A full charge using the magnetic puck takes about an hour, hitting 70% in 30 minutes.SpecificationsCase size:40mm or 44mmCase thickness:10.7mmWeight:about 26g or 33gProcessor:S10Storage:64GBOperating system:watchOS 26Water resistance:50 metres (5ATM)Sensors:HR (2nd-gen), skin temp, NFC, GNSS, compass, altimeterConnectivity:Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 4, NFC, optional 5GHealth and workout trackingView image in fullscreenThe SE 3 has the same crown and side button as the Series 11 but lacks the metal contacts on the back for taking ECGs.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOne of the biggest cuts for the SE 3 is the removal of the electrical sensor from the back of the watch, which enables electrocardiograms (ECG) of your heart on the Series and Ultra watches. It also lacks a blood oxygen sensor and hypertension monitoring but it still has an accurate optical heart rate sensor that covers most bases, including high and low heart rate notifications.The SE 3 also has a skin temperature sensor, which is used as part of theVitals app, the sleep tracking and forretrospective ovulation estimatesfor the cycles tracking app. The watch also does a good job of tracking general workouts, including walks, runs, cycles and other common sports and activities with its GPS.The watch also supports offline music playback via Bluetooth headphones, including from subscription services such as Spotify. And it has offline Apple Maps, should you get lost without your phone.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe recycled aluminium body is available in starlight (as pictured) or midnight (black).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple says the battery should last more than1,000 full-charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for£95. Repairs costbetween £195 and £229depending on the model.It contains more than 40% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, rare-earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impactin its report.PriceThe Apple Watch SE 3 costs from£219(€269/$249/A$399) for the 40mm version or£249(€299/$279/A$449) for 44mm.For comparison, theApple Watch Series 11costs£369and theApple Watch Ultra 3costs£749.VerdictTheApple WatchSE 3 is the best deal in Apple’s smartwatch line this year, offering almost everything that’s great about the Series 11 but at a significantly cheaper price.The new always-on display, S10 chip and watchOS 26 make the SE 3 just as good day to day. The only meaningful feature you miss out on is the ability to take ECGs, but if you know you don’t need it then that’s no loss. The 1.5-day battery life of the 40mm isn’t too bad but the larger 44mm should last a little longer.The limited choice of colours is easily remedied with a bright strap, while the older design with smaller screens, larger bezels and a thicker body is easy to live with for the price.Pros:great value Apple Watch, always-on screen, Apple Pay, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, decent health and fitness tracking, long software support, recycled materials, 50-metre water resistance.Cons:no ECG, no blood oxygen monitoring, no hypertension alerts, old design, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, screen not super bright in sunlight.View image in fullscreenThe new Exactograph face from watchOS 26 looks good on the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsApple WatchAppleWearable technologySmartwatchesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Much online brouhaha and frustration ensued at yet another Hollywood misrepresentation of modern day Ireland. The trailer was eventuallyrevealed to be an elaborate rusebyEpic, the Irish Emigration Museum in Dublin, to call out the tired stereotypes and “to find out who the Irish really are”.Fanad lighthouse map and surrounding areaIreland, and the Irish, are many things. The country’s economic and social structures have changed rapidly in recent decades but that doesn’t necessarily mean the culture has altered unrecognisably. What has changed is the increasing draw to connect with Ireland’s natural landscapes. Writers such as the lateTim Robinson,Manchán Maganand the popular podcasterBlindboyboatclubhave been pivotal in mining the connection between the natural world and the country’s past. TheIrish language has seen a renaissancein the past few years for the same reason. In his 2020 bestselling bookThirty-Two Words for Field, Magan writes: “Irish has a rich store of words that offers a more soulful and nature-connected way of seeing the world. It lets you live more deeply in your environment.”To test Magan’s hypothesis, I travelled with my family to the Fanad peninsula in theGaeltacht(Irish speaking) area of County Donegal this summer. The bilingual road sign that welcomed us to Fanad/Fánaidimmediately delivered a geographical context, fána being the Irish word for sloping ground. Knockalla mountain (Cnoc Colbha– the hill of the edge) loomed to the east, calling to mind images of the ice sheets that carved the ridge along the twin peaks about 14,000 years ago.View image in fullscreenFergal and family enjoy having the beach to themselves.Photograph: Fergal McCarthyThe ice age also had an impact on Fanad’s coast. The rocks that still line the foreshores of its pristine beaches were left behind by retreating glaciers and pounded ever since by the North Atlantic to make sand. We sought out one of those white beaches at Ballyhiernan Bay (Bá BhaileUíThiarnáin –the townland of Tiarnán). My phone offered no details of shadowy Tiarnán’s biography, but I wanted to find out more about why a whole bay was named after him – Robinson was right: “place names tell stories”. We were alone on the beach, our only company the swallows that surfed the air currents above the crashing waves. My 16-year-old son and I had spent the past year attending “pop-upGaeltachts”in Dublin pubs in preparation for his stint working at an Irish college, a rite of passage for Irish teenagers, yet the Irish word for swallow eluded him. It isfáinleog, probably fromfánmeaning to wander or to leave, perfectly capturing the penchant of these summer visitors for travelling to Africa in the winter.Irish has a rich store of words that offers a more soulful and nature-connected way of seeing the worldManchán MaganThe process of anglicising Irish place names began in the early 19th century, following the 1800 Act of Union, with towns being renamed as part of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, which began in 1824. This act of cultural erasure was soon followed by the great famine, from 1845 to 1852, which decimated the Irish-speaking population. In 1980, decades before the recent resurgence of interest in Ireland’s linguistic past, the Donegal playwright Brian Friel mined this pivotal era for his 1833-set opus Translations. The play’s erudite schoolmaster Hugh, who refers to Irish as “a syntax opulent with tomorrows”, might have smiled warmly at the idea of musicians such asCMAT,Fontaines DCandKneecapreleasing songs in the language nearly two centuries later.Settling in for our stay at acottage within the grounds of Fanad lighthouse, the view from our sitting room looked west to the towering cliffs of Tory Island (Toraigh– place of steep rocky heights), another far-flung corner where the native language maintains a grip, and famous for having akinguntil 2018. Ascending the vertiginous steps to the lantern room afforded us an even better view, with Malin Head (Cionn Mhálanna– high headland), Ireland’s most northerly tip, clearly visible across Lough Swilly (Loch Súilí– lake of eyes or shadows). The enormous expanse of sea to the north created a sense of the earth’s curvature, and Scotland and Iceland seemed almost within reach, somewhere in the distance.The next morning, whilekayakingunder the nearby cliffs and blowholes with knowledgable local guide Hugh Hunter, oystercatchers dived overhead, calling out angrily as we paddled by their nesting grounds. These black and white seabirds with orange, chisel-like beaks migrate here from the neighbouring Nordic countries every autumn. My son is none the wiser about the Irish for oystercatcher:Roilleach an Giolla Brighde, meaningthe servant of Saint Brigid. The story goes that Ireland’s patroness saint was hidden from an angry mob by a flock of oystercatchers who covered her in seaweed.View image in fullscreenKayaking with knowledgable guide Hugh Hunter.Photograph: Fergal McCarthyThat afternoon, we joined the throng in theLighthouse Tavernto watch the All-Ireland football final between Donegal and Kerry. There was a loud cheer in a mixture of Irish and English each time the home team scored. At half-time we joined a group of local teenagers as they discussed their impending university courses in Dublin. I wondered how their lives would change and who among them might come back, like the swallows and oystercatchers, to this far-flung peninsula.Later in the week, stopping for directions to Port Na Ling (harbour of the ships) beach, a local man engaged us in conversation, explaining he hadn’t spoken a word of English until he went to secondary school. He pointed out the house where he grew up with 11 siblings, among a constellation of white-washed bungalows on the hillside the other side of Mulroy Bay (An Mhaoil Rua– meaning the bare hill). Ireland’s pre-famine, largely rural population, peaked at about 8.2 million and a sense of how the country’s built environment looked back then is somehow still tangible in many coastal Donegal communities. Gweedore (Gaoth Dobhair– estuary of water), an hour away to the west, is described as one of Europe’s most densely populated rural areas. In the aftermath of the famine, people in Donegal largely survived by travelling to Scotland as potato pickers, and this seasonal work allowed the county’s population to remain relatively buoyant, with locals returning home in the winter months rather than emigrating permanently.View image in fullscreenView over the coastline of Gweedore, described as one of Europe’s most densely populated rural areas.Photograph: Gareth McCormack/AlamyWe finished our time in Fanad by following theWay of the Crossup Knockalla to an outdoor altar with three crosses looking out across the peninsula. Blindboyboatclub explains that “the Irish landscape itself acts as a storyteller, whispers tales of the past”. The pathway we had just ascended has been a place of spiritual significance for millennia, long before being co-opted by Christianity. The many standing stones and ancient sites strewn across the fields are signifiers of a secret history. We were the only people to climb the mountain that morning, and what a privilege to have this sacred site to ourselves.Our time in Fanad had been a portal to viewing the landscape afresh. Magan was right: the Irish language is an extraordinary conduit to the past and offers us a better understanding of the present.Two-nightstays atFanadlighthousefrom€350.

Dana Ellis Hunnes, a senior clinical dietitian at UCLA Health, says her local grocery store often stocks more non-dairy milk options than dairy ones. She’s tried various options, including a brief phase with coconut milk (“It was too creamy and too watery at the same time”). Now, she enjoysoat milk, which adds the right amount of creaminess to her coffee.The best choice depends on individual needs and preferences, says Hunnes. One person might want to add more protein to their diet, while another might be looking to increase their calcium intake. Flavor and mouthfeel are also important considerations.While dairy milk remains the most popular option in theUnited Statesand theUnited Kingdom, alternatives are here to stay. Here’s what experts say about how to select the right one for your lifestyle.How to pick your alternative milkAdults who use alternative milks do so for various reasons, including pursuing a plant-based diet, reducing theircarbon footprintor managing lactose intolerance.“The question of ‘what’s healthy or not?’ is a personal one,” says Abigail Johnson, an assistant professor and associate director of the Nutrition Coordinating Center at the University of Minnesota School of PublicHealth. “You need to think about what nutrients you need and consider the milk that can best add those to your diet.”Johnson is the lead author of a 2025studythat assessed the nutrient content of plant-based milks available in the United States. The study, which examined 219 plant-based milk alternatives from 21 brands, found that these alternatives were generally lower in protein and saturated fatty acids than dairy milk. Nutrients are often added to help alternative milks compete with dairy milk; 70% of the products were fortified with calcium and vitamin D, and otherresearchshows alternative milks are sometimes also fortified with vitamins A and B12.View image in fullscreenChecking the label is important when determining which product is right for you.Photograph: SolStock/Getty ImagesAdults likely don’t need to choose an alternative milk that matches dairy milk’s nutrient profile exactly, because they get those nutrients from other parts of their diet – unless they are especially concerned about their calcium intake, explains Dr Joan Sabate, a professor and executive director of the Center for Nutrition, Lifestyle and Disease Prevention at Loma Linda University.Checking the label is important when determining which product is right for you. The study found that the nutrient content of alternative milks varied. For instance, soy milk brands can contain different amounts of protein. “You can’t just pick a plant-based milk off the shelf and assume it’s going to meet your calcium needs,” says Johnson.Hunnes does “strongly recommend that people try to go for the unsweetened varieties” to minimize their sugar intake.“If someone is trying to get more protein, but with as minimal amount of sugar as possible, I might suggest they go for unsweetened pea protein milk or unsweetened soy milk,” she says.For most people, alternative milks will only make up a small part of their overall diet, says Hunnes. With that in mind, these milks “won’t make or break someone’s healthfulness”, says Hunnes. “People should focus on what kind they like best.”Do alternative milks contain seed oils?Because many alternative milks lack fat, manufacturers may add seed oil to give the liquids a smooth taste and consistency. Seed oils may also be used as emulsifiers to prevent ingredient separation.Experts sayresearch does not support claims that seed oils are toxic or drive chronic disease. But claims like Maha figurehead Robert F Kennedy Jr’s – that Americans are “unknowingly poisoned” by these products – have led some consumers to avoid them.RFK Jr says they are poisoning us, influencers call them unnatural – but what is the truth about seed oils?Read moreSome seed oils can be pro-inflammatory if consumed in very high amounts, explains Hunnes, but the amount of seed oil in some alternative milks isn’t enough to warrant concern, since people are likely to consume only half to a full cup daily.“Unless people are drinking a half a gallon of these non-dairy milks a day, it’s not something I would be concerned about,” says Hunnes.Research also suggests plant-derived oils may mitigate cardiovascular disease risk factors, says Johnson. “There’s not necessarily anything wrong with wanting to avoid seed oils and emulsifiers, but some perceived risks might not be accurate,” she says.Studies generally show that these oils are associated with lower mortality than butter, and experts haveobservedthat the purported adverse effects of seed oils have been conflated with the unhealthy foods they are sometimes used in.What are the pros and cons of each alternative milk?Soy milk: Johnson’s study found that soy-based products were most nutritionally similar to dairy milk. This is why Sabate recommends soy milk over other alternatives for children. It is also so similar to dairy milk in that it is the only alternativeincludedin the dairy section of the US dietary guidelines for Americans.Soy also has various beneficial, naturally occurringchemical compounds, says Sabate. These can support heart, kidney and liver health, she says. These include isoflavones, which are structurally similar to estrogen. This similarity may be why soy milk is linked to a lowerrisk of breast cancerandreduced hot flashes(although the evidence is mixed).This similarity has led to a false assumption that drinking soy milk could have feminizing effects on men, despitestudyafterstudyshowing that’s not true. For example,a reviewof 38 clinical studies found no adverse effects of soy on men. In one extremelyrare case, in which a man’s breasts grew after drinking soy milk, he was consuming 1.2 liters of daily for three years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to a 2022 UC Davisreport, it is the most popular alternative after almond milk, and demand is growing. This may be because oat milk’s sensory qualities are similar to dairy milk; oat milk also oftencontains more sugarthan almond, soy, pea and coconut milks.It also containsphytates, compounds with antioxidant properties that can help prevent bone loss and kidney stone formation. Someresearchsuggests that oat milk may be an appropriate dairy substitute for individuals with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Oat milk also hasmore fiberthan many alternative milks, except for rice milk.Phytates canimpairthe absorption of iron, zinc and calcium; however, consuming oat milk along with a balanced, nutrient-rich diet should minimize any adverse effects.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Almond milk:Those looking for something low-calorie or who are concerned about their blood sugar might want to try unsweetened almond milk, says Hunnes. It might also appeal to consumers who prioritize foods with fewer ingredients; there’srising interestin simpler ingredient lists, so consumers can better understand the health impacts of a product.That said, 2023researchfound that almond milk has less protein than cashew, hemp, pea and soy milk. It has more protein than coconut and rice milk.Production of almond milk also involves morewater usethan other plant-based milks – though dairy production still uses significantly more water.Coconut milk:Coconut milk has high levels of saturated fat, and is thus often marketed as having a mouthfeel similar to whole milk, explains Johnson.View image in fullscreenThere’s some evidence that coconut milk contains antioxidative compounds.Photograph: jayk7/Getty ImagesCritically, the American Heart Associationadviseslimiting saturated fats to less than 6 % of your total calories, so expertsrecommendmoderation.More research on coconut milk is needed to understand its health effects. But there is some evidence that it contains antioxidativecompoundsthat protect against DNA oxidative damage, which is linked to ageing-related diseases.Rice milk: Rice milk is made from milled rice and water, and isoften fortifiedwith calcium and vitamin D. Because it is very low in protein – oneservingmay contain 0.9 grams of protein, compared with 2.4 grams in oat milk and 1.7 grams in almond milk – experts recommend combining it with other protein-rich foods.Rice milk may appeal to some because it’s low in saturated fat and cholesterol, and it’s theleast allergenicof milk alternatives. It’s sometimes the choice of athletes and others with high energy needs because it containsmore carbohydrates.All rice canpotentiallycontain arsenicbecause rice plants absorb the element from the soil. There are no dietary limits for arsenic in rice milk, but some reportsadvise cautionaround intake for children. Because young children eat three times more food for their size than adults do, they are more likely to take in higher amounts of inorganic arsenic from their diet. For instance, the FDArecommendsthat infant rice cereals not contain more than 100 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic.There’s a need formore researchto know the health effects of consuming arsenic via rice milk, though exposure is likely very low unless you’re drinking a lot of rice milk. Peopleconsumean estimated 5 to 25 micrograms of arsenic daily as part of their diet.Blended milk: Blended milks are relatively new and need further study. One 2024papersuggests blended milks have a more similar mouthfeel to dairy milk than non-blended alternatives.Some alternative milk products combine various plant protein sources, and may be fortified with calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients.If you want a product with a higher protein content, opt for soy or pea, which naturally contain protein, or blended products with those ingredients, says Johnson. Pea milk, for example, may have7 gramsmore protein per one-cup serving than almond milk, and also naturally contains vitamin A. Researchsuggeststhat blending different plant proteins can create a more nutritious product.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyMilkFoodHealthSeedsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Keep frying in small batches until you have used all the mixture.Arrange the croquettes on a serving dish and serve with a dollop of Greek yoghurt and a squeeze of lemon.This is an edited extract fromThessalonikiby Meni Valle, photography and styling by Stephanie Stamatis ($50; Hardie Grant Books).Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkGreek food and drinkFoodAustralian lifestylerecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Every Christmas I’m given chutney, and I still have four barely used jars. What to do with them before the next lot arrive?Christine, OxfordThis sounds like a job for Claire Dinhut, author ofThe Condiment Book, who also goes by the moniker Condiment Claire. She would approach this meal by meal, starting with breakfast. “It might not seem so obvious,” she says, “but I put Branston pickle on my avocado toast. If you think about it, you often add acidity, which is usually lemon, but chutney is punchy and has that same tang, as well as a bit of texture.” Regardless of what jars Christine has hanging around, Dinhut would also consider the breakfast bap: “Whether it’s spicy mango, peach, chilli or tomato chutney, that would be so delicious with an egg yolk.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Roger Pizey, executive head of pastry atFortnum & Mason, is no stranger to Christine’s chutney conundrum: “Sometimes we’ve got so much left over that I’m at my wit’s end knowing what to do with it.” And, often, the best solution is the simplest, which is why Pizey often spoons a good dollop of, say, fig and fennel chutney into a golden, gooey toastie. “You can geta lotof chutney in there with a few generous layers of Ogleshield [a raclette-style cheese], which takes the tart, acidic flavour of chutney really well.”Of course, chutney also plays very well in other sandwiches and wraps (ham, turkey, coronation chicken), or use it as a glaze or marinade for meat. “It’s already balanced,” Dinhut says, “so you don’t necessarily need to add anything else. If you’re putting chicken breasts in the air fryer, for example, smear mango chutney [peach also works well] all over the meat, which will give it a really nice glaze.” Cyrus Todiwala, author ofModern Indian: Small Plates, Big Flavours, Fabulous Feasts, meanwhile, puts his mango chutney in a blender and purees it: “That’s the ideal glaze for brushing on chicken, turkey or pork before roasting.”Soup is hot right now, so if you’re having a bowl of squash or pumpkin soup, you could do a lot worse than spreading a piece of baguette with soured cream and chutney and using that for dunking, Dinhut says. She also has form for adding chutney (think apple or tomato) to salad dressings instead of honey: “It brings that bit of texture, vinegar and sweetness, which is especially good in a rice or barley salad with roast sweet potato, dried cranberries and goat’s cheese.”But do remember to keep things clean. “It burns me up when people take a spoon and scrape it around the sides of the jar,” Todiwala says. “That’s the place where fungus will start to grow, so keep the lid and edges of the jar clean by wiping them with a dry cloth or some kitchen paper after use.” That way, no jar will ever be left behind: “When you do finish a jar, use up the last few bits of chutney by cracking in a couple of eggs, sealing the jar and giving it a good shake. Then use the contents to make scrambled eggs,” Dinhut says. And those will happily do you for breakfast, lunch or dinner.Got a culinary dilemma?

The account was reinstated byTfL with a different spelling of his surname, sohis appeals of his PCNs were refused because he was deemed to be a “third party”.TfL has refused to let him pay the debts through anindividualvoluntaryarrangement. He has dyslexia and a serious chronic autoimmune disease triggered by stress. His mental health is at the point where he has mentioned suicide.LM,LondonIt seems misunderstandings, miscommunication and panic has caused your brother-in-law’s situation to spiral out of control.TfL insists it informed him of alternative ways to pay when his auto pay account was suspended over a disputed payment last December. In a recorded call to customer services in February, he was told that his appeals against the PCNs were rejected because the misspelled surname suggested he was an invalid third party.TfL subsequently corrected its error.Another recording from the summer shows how hard he tried to set up an affordable payment plan but was repeatedly given conflicting information.All the while, the PCNs continued to come thick and fast and he lacked the funds to keep up with payments.It is the responsibility of drivers to ensure they pay all official charges due. It is not in dispute that your brother failed for many reasons to do so on multiple occasions, so I believe the PCNs were technically legitimate.Ethically, I’m not so sure. It seems that TfL’s system obstructed rather than helped him. TfL, when informed of his deteriorating mental health, hastily cancelled all outstanding PCNs, which removes the terror of never-ending debt, but not the hole in the family finances from the thousands already paid. His auto pay is now active again.“We will always try and support people who are struggling to pay penalty charges,” said a spokesperson. “We have been in contact with him and have agreed to accept the amount he has paid to resolve the matter.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

One day they’re full of life; the next they look like tumbleweed left on a radiator. Fern fronds crisp up at the first hint of dry air, and once they turn brown, most think it’s game over.ThehackPut the plant inside a clear plastic bag – but don’t seal it as it still needs some airflow – and place it in bright but indirect light.Houseplant clinic: why is there a chalky crust on my plant’s soil?Read moreThe TheoryThe bag creates a mini terrarium, trapping humidity around the plant. Think of it as recreating the rainforest atmosphere – the moist microclimate where ferns thrive. It doesn’t water the plant for you, but it drastically slows down evaporation and encourages fragile new fronds to unfurl.ThetestI used this trick on a Boston fern that looked beyond saving. After 10 days in its misty cocoon the soil was still damp and tiny green curls began to appear.

Some of its troops have posted videos of civilians being shot, including in the town’s maternity hospital.As criticism grows, is UAE ready to walk away from Sudan’s RSF militia?Read moreThe two-year civil war between the Sudanese armed forces (SAF) and the RSF has created what the UN has described asone of the worst humanitarian crisesof the 21st century.More than 150,000 peoplehave been killed andmore than 14 milliondisplaced from their homes.Prosecutors at the international criminal court said on Monday that they werecollecting evidence of alleged mass killings, rape and other crimes in El Fasher.Guterres urged the warring parties to “come to the negotiating table, bring an end to this nightmare of violence – now”.“The horrifying crisis inSudan… is spiralling out of control,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the World Summit for Social Development in Qatar.“El Fasher and the surrounding areas in North Darfur have been an epicentre of suffering, hunger, violence and displacement. And since the Rapid Support Forces entered El Fasher last weekend, the situation is growing worse by the day. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are trapped by this siege. People are dying of malnutrition, disease and violence.”His call at the Doha conference came as the SAF, based in Port Sudan, discussed whether to support a US-proposed truce, or to insist any ceasefire be dependent on the RSF withdrawing from Sudan’s cities, including El Fasher.View image in fullscreenA satellite image shows smoke rising from fires near El Fasher airport.Photograph: ©2025 Vantor/EPAThe fall of El Fasher gives the RSF control of all five state capitals in Darfur, raising fears that Sudan could in effect be partitioned along an east-west axis, but the Sudanese ambassador to the UK, Babikir Elamin, said there was little support for partition in Darfur itself.He said the priority was not a ceasefire, but action to end the massacres in El Fasher.The US has been trying since September to persuade the two sides to back a peace plan agreed by Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia that would start with a three-month humanitarian pause, followed by a permanent ceasefire that would start a nine-month transition to a civilian-led government.Washington is hoping that with the two-year civil war finally attracting greater world attention, the publicity may force the warring parties and their external supporters to relent on their maximalist positions.Initial signs from a lengthy SAF security and defence council meeting, however, are that there is strong resistance to the US plan developed by Donald Trump’s envoy toAfrica, Massad Boulos.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not clear how such RSF withdrawals could be enforced.Speaking in London, Elamin called on Washington to designate the RSF a terrorist organisation and for a ban on all arms sales to the UAE.The UAE denies supplying weapons to the RSF.Elamin said: “The RSF are now openly and publicly vowing to commit yet further crimes in cities and parts of the country. They have named the cities, the communities and the ethnic groups they are targeting.“Parts of the country that have never witnessed violence are now threatened. They are proudly making videos of themselves murdering innocent civilians. Some of them admit they have lost count of the number of people they have killed.”He said that as the SAF leadership had been exploring the US peace plan, the RSF were attacking El Fasher.“What is the reason for getting engaged in talks while they are still committing these kind of atrocities,” he asked. “Before we can discuss the kind of proposal, the international community should show some kind of seriousness in dealing with these atrocities that are still taking place in El Fasher.

His mother and father had become “increasingly concerned” for his safety in the year prior, fearing he was “becoming involved in the gang culture which was prevalent in the area”.Videos, photos and messages, which made them fear he was involved in theft, fraud and possessing knives, had been found on his phone by his parents, while his mother had found a kitchen knife hidden at the home.The judge said since his parents did not want him to return home soon, the risk of relationship breakdown would be “very high” if he did, with the likelihood he would be exposed to “the very serious risks” they had tried to protect him from.Before being taken to Ghana, the boy had become “secretive and dishonest about his whereabouts and possessions,” with his parents struggling to manage “deteriorating behaviour” that was “influenced by peer pressure”.His mother still “considers him at risk of serious physical harm or death” if he returns, her barrister, Michael Gration, KC told a hearing last month.In her judgment, Mrs Justice Theis said while there was “very real concern” about the effect of him remaining in a country where he felt abandoned, he had “more of an understanding of why his parents took the steps they did”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We should have put our foot down collectively. We did not call it a coup.”It is a striking reversal. The UAE had actively undermined the idea of a strong civilian democratic government in Sudan in the aftermath of the popular uprising that led to the downfall of the 30-year, Islamist-aligned dictatorship of Omar al-Bashirin April 2019.Throughout 2019, “in the interests of a stable transition”, the UAE and Saudi Arabia tried to enhance the role of the military and marginalise civilian rule, including by promoting the idea that the RSF commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, should be in charge of economic policy.In a piece of bailout diplomacy, Saudi Arabia and the Emiratis quickly agreed a $3bn loan to the transitional military council that initially tried to succeed Bashir. In late 2019, when the civilian side of the government had the upper hand, further payouts from the loan were stopped.Jonas Horner, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote recently that the loss of the loan not only critically undermined the civilian government but also led directly to the coup in 2021, followed by the civil war that broke out between the army and the RSF in 2023.“The fate of the transitional government would likely have been dramatically different had the Gulf backed them with the billions they had pledged to the military,” Horner wrote.Finger of blameFour years on from the coup, the Gargash admission is a sign that in public at least the UAE acknowledges that itsSudanpolicy has gone wrong and that it must distance itself from the RSF, the force it so nurtured.That the Emiratis covertly armed the RSF is clear fromevidence compiledby the UN, independent experts and reporters, even though the UAE denies it. In January, the Biden administration pointed the finger of blame when it imposed sanctions on Hemedti and seven UAE-based companies funding him.View image in fullscreenMohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, centre, in 2019.Photograph: Mahmoud Hjaj/APSudanese civilian groups warned for more than 18 months that the RSF would commit ethnically targeted mass killings if it took El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur. That placed a special obligation on the UAE, the country with the greatest ability to restrain Hemedti. Although the UAE has condemned the atrocities in El Fasher, it also put the blame for what happened on the army’s failure to compromise.The UAE’s response to international criticism is to insist that it is being traduced and that it is the victim of a disinformation campaign fuelled by Islamists inside the Sudanese army and by leftwing NGOs long opposed to the Gulf state.A Sudanese massacre foretold: the grim familiarity of the RSF’s rampage through El FasherRead moreIt insists it wants a transition back to a civilian-led Sudanese government, and says both the RSF and the army have disqualified themselves from shaping Sudan’s future.Figures such as the UAE foreign affairs minister, Lana Nusseibeh, say the country is not the primary sponsor of the war but rather a neutral party seeking to mediate a return to the civilian, Islamist-free rule that started with the 2019 uprising and ended with the 2021 coup.Yasmine Ahmed, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, said a minimum test of the UAE’s sincerity about breaking with the RSF would be pro-active cooperation with the UN expert panel policing the arms embargo on Sudan.As Cameron Hudson, a former chief of staff to successive US special envoys on Sudan, puts it: “What we see is a complete and total denial by the UAE authorities they have any role or involvement whatsoever in this conflict. Until we can agree on a basic set of facts about what is happening and who is driving it, it is going to be very difficult to resolve.”What happens next will also depend on whether the UAE thinks that the RSF – and its tainting brutality – are still indispensable to its two keys goals in Sudan: accessing resources and deterring the influence of Islamism, the belief that Islam is innately political and that it should influence political systems. The UAE in particular regards the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood as a threat to security in the region.Natural resourcesThe UAE is just one of the Gulf states to have been drawn to Sudan’s natural resources for decades.Jaafar Nimeiri, Sudan’s president from 1969 to 1985, promised that in return for Gulf investment Sudan could become the breadbasket of the Arab world, as well as a source of a badly needed and sometimes highly educated workforce.Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE all responded, each arriving with different political agendas. Saudi Arabia and the UAE both made multibillion-dollar agricultural investments in Sudan to secure food for their populations, first under Nimieri and then through the authoritarian rule of Bashir, who seized power in 1989 and worked in alliance with Islamists.The fact that Bashir came to be heavily sanctioned by the US proved little constraint as the Gulf states poured money into Sudan. “For these young, wealthy monarchies – which import upwards of 80% of all the food they consume – securing access to Sudan’s agriculture, livestock and mineral resources is a virtually existential concern,” said Horner, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.Sudan’s strategic location on the Red Sea made it highly attractive place for the UAE to build ports, and in December 2022 the state-owned Abu Dhabi Ports Group and Invictus Investment signed a $6bn deal to invest in the Abu Amama port, 125 miles north of Port Sudan. The contract has since been cancelled by Sudan’s de factor leader, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, but the UAE will be keen to revive the scheme under any successor.Emirati banks hold stakes in Bank of Khartoum, the largest commercial bank in Sudan, whose digital platform facilitates money transfers for millions of displaced Sudanese and public institutions. However, it is Sudan’s gold reserves that are of particular importance, not just to the RSF and the army, which operate as businesses as much as fighting forces, but also to the UAE.View image in fullscreenRSF fighters display gold bars seized from a plane that landed at Khartoum airport in May 2019.Photograph: Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah/ReutersGold represents about 49% of Sudan’s exports. In February, the state-owned Sudan Mineral Resources Company said gold production in army-controlled areas reached 74 tonnes in 2024, up from 41.8 tonnes in 2022. The Central Bank of Sudan reported that in 2024 almost 97% of official gold exports (from army-held areas) went to the UAE, earning $1.52bn.Official exports are a drop in the ocean, however. An estimated 90% of Sudan’s gold production, amounting to approximately $13.4bn in illicit trade, is smuggled out of the country, often passing through transit routes in Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and South Sudan before reaching the UAE.In areport last monthfor Chatham House, Ahmed Soliman and Dr Suliman Baldo wrote: “The UAE continues to benefit from Sudan’s conflict gold, as the enforcement of restrictions on artisanal gold imports from countries where there is war or where gold is controlled by armed groups remains limited.”The UAE’s conduit is Hemedti, with whom they forged a special relationship when he agreed to send RSF troops to Yemen in support of Emirati and Saudi forces fighting the Houthis. He owns many of the mines in Darfur through his family firm Algunade.Politics, as well as profit, also drive the Emirati interest. As with its parallel interventions in eastern Libya and south Yemen, the UAE wants to contest the Islamism with which Bashir was allied.Collective pressureNow that its support for the RSF seems so perilous reputationally, there is an onus on the UAE to contribute to a resolution of the crisis.The US hopes the solution lies in Sudan’s two key external players, the UAE and Egypt, which backs the army and wants keep the conflict within Sudan’s border, finally agreeing they will collectively press their proxies into a ceasefire. The statement agreed by the US, Saudi, Egypt and UAE – four countries engaged in mediation efforts collectively known as the Quad – on 12 September was a breakthrough in that regard in that it set out a course for a three-month humanitarian truce, leading to a permanent ceasefire, and within nine months the establishment of an independent, civilian-led government with broad-based legitimacy and accountability.It added: “Sudan’s future governance is for the Sudanese people to decide through an inclusive and transparent transition process, not controlled by any warring party.”One other passage in the joint statement protected UAE interests: “Sudan’s future cannot be dictated by violent extremist groups part of, or evidently linked to, the Muslim Brotherhood, whose destabilising influence has fuelled violence and instability across the region.”Talks on these proposals in Washington – so far excluding Sudanese civilians – have not yet borne fruit, suggesting it may yet require more senior US officials to engage before the protagonists of Sudan’s civil war and their supporters accept that further fighting offers only more misery.Explore more on these topicsSudanUnited Arab EmiratesAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The dead included a 14-year-old and a 19-year-old who was decapitated and had his head exhibited on a tree. One police victim had his leg amputated after being shot.‘This was a slaughter, not an operation’: the favela reeling from Rio’s deadliest police raidRead moreThere has been widespread public support for the carnage, with Rio’s rightwing governor, Cláudio Castro, hailing the operation as a severe blow to the Rio-born Red Command drug faction, one of Brazil’s biggest crime groups.But speaking in the Amazon city of Belém on Tuesday, Brazil’s leftwing president said that while “some might see the operation as a success from the point of view of the number of deaths” he believed it had been “disastrous” as an action of the state.“There was a massacre, and I think it’s important to verify the conditions under which it occurred,” Lula told foreign journalists after arriving in Belém for the start of the Cop30 climate summit.“The judge’s order [authorizing the operation] was for arrest warrants to be executed, not a massacre. And there was a massacre,” Lula said in Belém, which despite being nearly 2,500km north of Rio, has also become a major Red Command hub as the faction has pushed deeper into the Amazon. Police say 19 of those killed during Tuesday’s operation were from Pará state of which Belém is capital.Lula said he wanted to see federal police forensic investigators involved in an inquiry into the killings.Polls show broad public approval for the raid, which had by far the highest death toll in Rio’s history and was even deadlier than 1992’s Carandiru prison massacre in Sāo Paulo, when 111 inmates were killed.But security experts and activists argue it will do nothing to fundamentally weaken the Red Command or solve Rio’s four-decade conflict, which has seen heavily armed drug traffickers occupy poor areas abandoned by the police.“If killing people fixed the problem, Brazil would be Switzerland,” one of the world’s safest countries, said security specialist Cecília Olliveira, whose group, Fogo Cruzado (Cross Fire), tracks armed violence.The massacre has overshadowed the start of Brazil’s climate summit and a visit Prince William is making to Rio ahead of those talks.

But no,Mexicois a free, independent and sovereign country,” Sheinbaum said.Mexico and the US have long collaborated in tackling drug-trafficking groups, with the US at times sending CIA, military and Drug Enforcement Administration operatives to support Mexico’s efforts to combat organized crime.But the incursion of US troops into Mexico to directly confront the cartels, particularly without Mexico’s agreement, would be an unprecedented step that would almost certainly fracture an already tenuous bilateral relationship.Mexico president dismisses US claim of cartel bounties on immigration officialsRead moreThe Trump administration has made confronting drug-trafficking groups a central pillar of its foreign policy: in February, Washingtondesignated six Mexican cartelsas foreign terrorist organizations.It has also launched a series of attacks against alleged drug-trafficking boats, most recentlystriking vessels in the eastern Pacificthat killed 14 alleged traffickers in late October.Although Mexico rescued one of the survivors from the attack, Sheinbaumcondemned the strikesand ordered officials from her government to discuss them with the US ambassador to Mexico.On Tuesday, Sheinbaum also noted that Mexico had reached a security agreement with the United States that was negotiated over several months.“We are going to continue working within this framework of understanding, which has very clear principles … which respects our sovereignty and our territoriality.”The Mexican president has also appeared cooler on militarised anti-narcotics tactics than her predecessors: on Monday, she ruled out any changes to the country’s security strategy despite the recent brutal killing of a mayor in western Mexico.“Some are calling for militarization and war, as happened with the war on drugs,” Sheinbaum said. “That didn’t work.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoDonald TrumpClaudia SheinbaumDrugs tradeDrugsAmericasTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The office of Peru’s president, José Jerí, issued a statement accusing Mexico’s government of repeated interference in his country’s internal affairs.Authorities have accused Chávez of participating in a failed effort in 2022 by the then president,Pedro Castillo, to declare a state of emergency and dissolve Peru’s parliament as legislators prepared an impeachment vote against him. Castillo failed to get the military’s support for his move, and parliament swiftly deposed him. He was arrested after prosecutors accused him of trying to promote a coup and he remains in custody.‘We’ll march as many times as necessary’: Peru’s youth protesters defy state of emergencyRead moreThe Peruvian attorney general’s office has accused Chávez of being an accomplice in the crime of rebellion against the powers of the state, and is seeking a jail term of up to 25 years. Chávez has denied knowing about Castillo’s plan to dissolve the legislature.“Today we learned with surprise and deep regret that the former prime minister Betssy Chávez, the alleged co-author of the coup attempted by the former president, Pedro Castillo, is being granted asylum at the residence of the Mexican embassy in Peru,” De Zela told reporters.The Mexican government said it regretted Peru’s decision, noting Mexico granted Chávez asylum in compliance with international law.“Mexico rejects Peru’s unilateral decision as excessive and disproportionate in response to a legitimate act by Mexico consistent with international law, which in no way constitutes intervention in Peru’s internal affairs,” the country’s foreign ministry said in a statement.Castillo’s wife and children are in Mexico, where authorities have expressed sympathy for the former Peruvian president, who came to power on a leftist platform.Mexico’s left-leaning president,Claudia Sheinbaum, reaffirmed her support for Castillo last month, insisting he had been the victim of a coup. She called for his release from jail and and for him to receive a fair trial.The Peruvian foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday that since the events of December 2022, “the Mexican government has been interfering in an inadmissible and systematic manner in Peru’s internal affairs”.It said Mexico had not changed its “unacceptable position” despite the Peruvian government repeatedly demanding respect for its sovereignty.Explore more on these topicsPeruMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Carmakers in the EU warned last weekthey were “days away” from production stoppages.The trade tensions with the EU are in contrast to the truce struck between China and the US last Thursday.The White House said in its readout after the agreement that Chinawould “eliminate” all “current and proposed export controls on rare earth elements and other critical materials” and end the semiconductor “retaliation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Court documents show the US Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation told the Dutch foreign ministry in June: “The fact that the company’s CEO is still the same Chinese owner is problematic … It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced.”The dispute escalated last week when Nexperia told customersall supplies to its Chinese factory had been suspended. Although Nexperia’s chips are manufactured in Europe, about 70% are packaged in China before distribution.Wingtech said the actions of the Dutch government “appear to be aimed at allowing a new Dutch-owned company to take Nexperia”. It warned that “any Nexperia-successor company is doomed to fail”, adding that “80% of Nexperia’s back-end capacity is within mainland China”.A spokesperson said: “If this matter is not resolved very soon, there will be no company left for customers to return to, and hundreds of people in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK will lose their jobs with many more affected indirectly across Europe. Nexperia’s European employees are very concerned about this, but the company’s senior Dutch management appears oblivious to these concerns.”The Dutch economic affairs ministry told Reuters that talks between the two governments were still under way. “We remain in contact with the Chinese authorities and our international partners to work toward a constructive solution that is good for Nexperia and our economies,” a spokesperson said.The dispute adds to the turmoil that UK auto manufacturers have faced after a cyber-attack forced Jaguar Land Rover, Britain’s largest carmaker, to halt production in September.JLR has resumed production, supporting asmall boostto UK factories in October.

Teachers, principals and school boards have said the change risks sidelining Indigenous children and damaging social cohesion.In a statement provided to the Guardian, Stanford said the treaty obligation “made no difference to raising the achievement of Māori [children]” and that it was unfair to place the obligation on school boards.School boards are made up of elected representatives including teachers, parents and sometimes students.“Parents who are effectively volunteers, already responsible for the governance of their local school, were suddenly expected to interpret and implement a treaty obligation that rightfully sits with the Crown,” Stanford said.School boards would now be required to “seek to achieve equitable outcomes for Māori students”, take steps to provide for teaching and learning in Māori language (te reo Māori) to students whose parents and caregivers request it, and take steps to ensure the school reflects cultural diversity.But teachers, principals and school boards say that while they might still choose to include Māori culture in their schools, removing the legal requirement for it risked making Indigenous culture, education and language less visible.“The suggestion that this clause makes no difference simply isn’t true,” the president of the school boards association, Meredith Kennett, said in a statement.The treaty clause helped school boardsimplement policies that reflected the needs of Māori and all New Zealanders, she said.It had been a unifying influence in schools, not a divisive one, Kennett said.“It causes no harm to have it there, but causes plenty of harm – including to social cohesion – by removing it.”The president of the principals’ federation, Leanne Otene, said school boards had embraced the treaty obligation and it had helped to create school cultures where Māori children felt reflected, and where their language and culture was valued and respected.Examples included schools learning about their local history from iwi (tribes), singing and performing traditional song and dance, and incorporating Māori language in signs and greetings, Otene told the Guardian.“There is rich historic knowledge that is passed down from generation to generation which builds a culture and a uniqueness about why our land … is different from any other country,” Otene said.Other countries looked up to New Zealand for reviving Indigenous language and culture and the change would put the country “completely out of step as global leaders”, she said.Since taking office, the coalition government has said it wants to end “race-based policies”. It has ushered insweeping rollbacksto policies that are designed to improve health, wellbeing and representation outcomes for Māori.The Labour leader,Chris Hipkins, described the move as a “step backwards”, saying on Tuesday: “[The government] would far rather have culture wars than focus on the mess they are making with the economy.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Just one centre remains open.First person arrives on Nauru triggering Australia’s $2.5bn deal with island nationRead moreWhen asked about the deportation, the home affairs minister,Tony Burke, said: “If people have had their visas cancelled, we expect them to leave.”Last month, when Burke was asked how many of the 350 people in the NZYQ group had been re-detained before deportation, he said estimates – which ranged between “high teens to 20s and beyond” – were roughly correct.The $2.5bn deal between Australia and Nauru was expected to last 30 years and would allow Australia to apply for 30-year long-term visas on behalf of the cohort to enable their deportation from the country.About $20m of the first instalment would become immediately available for the Nauruan government to “facilitate the settlement”, while the remaining $388m would go into a sovereign trust fund, which was expected to co-governed by both the Nauruan and Australian governments.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIan Rintoul, a spokesperson for Refugee Action Coalition Sydney, accused the government of trying to “replace indefinite detention in Australia” with “indefinite detention on Nauru”.“The government also seems to be trying to thwart the high court again by sending people before the high court can consider an upcoming challenge to their new deportation laws,” he said.Ogy Simic, the advocacy head for the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the deportations were happening under a veil of secrecy.“Once again, we are all piecing together fragments of information to try to find the truth of what is being done in our name,” he said.“And meanwhile, people are being deported in secret, locked up on a remote island and given what is essentially a life sentence with no recourse and no right to justice.”Another human rights lawyer, Sarah Dale, the Refugee Advice and Casework Service centre director, said she was “incensed by the cloak of darkness that this process remains hidden under”.“To not know if they were afforded due process, access to legal advice, appropriate health assessments or otherwise only echoes every single concern we have flagged with this process, let alone the repugnance of the policy itself,” she said.Details of the agreement between Nauru and Australia remain a secret.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An offence is committed if someone behaves in a way that “intends that conduct to materially assist a foreign intelligence service in carrying out UK-related activities”, or in conduct likely to assist that service.In October the university apologised and said it was lifting the ban on Murphy’s work on China and forced labour.A spokesperson for Sheffield Hallam said the decision to halt the academic’s work was “based on our understanding of a complex set of circumstances at the time, including being unable to secure the necessary professional indemnity insurance”.“Following a review, we have since approved Prof Murphy’s latest research and are committed to supporting her to undertake and disseminate this important work.“We have apologised to Prof Murphy and wish to make clear our commitment to supporting her research and to securing and promoting freedom of speech and academic freedom within the law.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also had no shoes or socks. Neither his family nor his lawyer were told he would be moved across the state; his lawyer found out after calling the previous cells to be told he’d been moved.The man was relocated as part of a process called “decanting”: the shuffling of people across prisons and police cells inVictoriaas the state balances its tougher bail laws with a shortage of beds and corrections workers.Victorian police have an agreement with Corrections Victoria that nobody will be housed for more than 14 days in police cells, as both authorities recognise these cells are not equipped to hold people longer than necessary.‘When I came out of prison, I couldn’t wait to create’: leading artists and inmates team up to break the prison cycleRead moreThe agreement is regularly breached. This means that people on remand – those who have either not been found guilty of any offence, or have not been sentenced – are typically housed in cells for 23 hours a day, with less access to healthcare, and less chance of being able to be visited or contacted by family and lawyers, than those in prisons.In cases from the past six months uncovered by Guardian Australia, people have been moved from Melbourne to cells in Bendigo and Geelong.People are even regularly completing entire prison sentences in police cells.There are also unconfirmed reports of people being released from police custody in towns hundreds of kilometres from their homes, with no clear way for them to return.Last month there were about 30 people in police cells who had been there for more than 14 days, according to evidence by senior officers to the inquest of Cody Dwyer, who died in custody in 2021.The inquest had also heard police wanted to renegotiate the agreement with corrections from 14 to seven days, aware of the human rights implications of keeping people in inappropriate cells for longer than necessary.But no agreement could be reached, as the state’s justice system sags under the weight of record demand for remand beds, while the newly appointed police commissioner, Mike Bush, also pushes for more police to return to the streets.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailGeraldine Veneziano, Corrections Victoria’s acting general manager of the sentence management team, told the Dwyer inquest that the police cells were needed when prisons “bottleneck”.The regularity with which this occurs meant little could be done to meet the police request of reducing the number of days people can spend in their cells.Lawyers have taken to emailing Corrections Victoria, when they are concerned about their clients having been moved to police cells across the state or held longer than the 14-day agreement.Corrections Victoria refers them to Victoria police, saying that if people are in their cells, they’re not corrections’ responsibility.Sometimes, it will forward the email to Victoria police’s custody management division.In the emails, seen by Guardian Australia, the opening of Western Plains prison is seen as a possible solution to the issue. The 1,200-bed prison opened on 26 June but there remains a shortage of staff across the corrections system.“If I talk about today’s custody landscape, we do have people that are in excess of 14 days in custody at a police detention facility,” Jacki Kline, a Victoria police superintendent in the custody management division, told the Dwyer inquest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He died two days laterRead moreThe Dwyer inquest also heard that as of early October, about 20 people were completing prison sentences in police cells.In a statement, a police spokesperson said the force could only transfer a certain number of people each day to corrections, based on their capacity.“These numbers vary and Victoria police prioritises the transfer of individuals taking into account those who require medical support or other relevant circumstances including those from vulnerable community groups.“Victoria police will continue to work with Corrections Victoria to ensure offenders are placed in appropriate detention facilities in a timely manner.“Nobody is placed in a police cell until the relevant risks, management requirements and considerations for the individual have been assessed.”A Department of Justice spokesperson tied the higher demand to beds to the bail reforms.“Corrections Victoria is working closely with Victoria police to ensure that offenders are managed as quickly as possible,” they said.In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

Radiohead haven’t recorded a studio album since 2016, and each of the band members has been involved in other successful and creatively stimulating projects, so fans were beginning to wonder if they might never hear from them again.But there was excitement last year at the news the band had reconvened for casual rehearsals, then a frenzied rush for tickets when new shows were announced in September, and finally a rapturous reception in Madrid for this concert in the round.With little chat with the crowd beyond the occasional “gracias”, the British quintet played 21 songs, opening with Let Down from 1997’s OK Computer and adding other songs from the highly lauded first half of their career including Paranoid Android, Karma Police, Fake Plastic Trees, Idioteque and No Surprises.But while they didn’t shy away from well-known songs, it was no greatest hits set, bringing in numerous album tracks and drawing heavily from 2003’s Hail to the Thief.View image in fullscreenFans queue outside Madrid’s Movistar Arena on Tuesday.Photograph: Ashifa KassamAn hour or so before the sun rose over Madrid, Francesco Puddu had staked out a prime spot in front of the city’s hulking Movistar Arena. He was among the first Radiohead fans to arrive at the venue, buzzing with expectations.“I’m incredibly excited. Like, I don’t think it’s real,” said the 27-year-old, who had travelled from Italy. “It’s been so long that even if they play the same song 20 times in a row, I’ll be happy.”The hours passed quickly as fans plotted where to position themselves in front of the circular stage, and revelled in the fact that they were among the privileged ones who had scored tickets for a tour that had sold out in minutes.The war in Gaza was another topic that had come up throughout the day, given that the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israelhad calledon people to boycott the tour, citing band member Jonny Greenwood’s 2024 performance in Tel Aviv.The topic seemingly remains sensitive for the band: after the Guardian reported onthe boycott callin September, its journalists were blocked from receiving tickets to review the Madrid concert. The band have not commented on the decision.In Spain, wherehundreds of thousandshave taken to the streets in solidarity with Palestine, the band’s actions had left some fans conflicted.“It would have been nice if they had spoken out about it much earlier,” said Lola, 22, who asked that her last name not be published. “As a fan of Radiohead, I was a little bit disappointed. But at least I think they learned their lesson.”View image in fullscreenAlessandra Fossati: ‘They always change from one record to another, they never do the same thing.’Photograph: Ashifa KassamShe pointed to the incident last year in Melbourne, when the band’s frontman, Thom Yorke, brieflywalked off stageduring a solo gig after a pro-Palestinian heckler shouted: “How many dead children will it take for you to condemn the genocide in Gaza?”It was not the right way to respond, said Lola. “I didn’t like that reaction.” In the end, however, the music had won her over. “I obviously can’t control what I feel when I listen to music … I really wanted to come and listen to the voices and sounds that I’ve been listening to since I was 12 years old.”Yorke laterreleased a statementsaying the incident in Melbourne left him “in shock that my supposed silence was somehow being taken as complicity”, describing the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his administration as “extremists” who “need to be stopped”.Before the European tour, Yorketold the Sunday Timesthat he would “absolutely not” perform in Israel. “I wouldn’t want to be 5,000 miles anywhere near the Netanyahu regime,”he added.Some defended the band, citing their long history of activism. “They’ve always stood for peace, they can’t have changed now,” said Alessandra Fossati. “I think the people who know them, know that they are on the right side.”Tuesday’s concert was to be the 50th time she had seen Radiohead perform, after becoming hooked when she first saw them live in 1995.This time she had tickets for five of the shows: opening night in Madrid and every single performance in her home country of Italy.“They always change from one record to another, they never do the same thing,” she said as she showed off her two Radiohead-themed tattoos. “I mean, I used to be a U2 fan but they kept doing the same things. And after a while you get bored.”For some, the fact that the band had gone seven years without performing together had injected a sense of urgency into the new tour.“There might not be another opportunity, Radiohead is pretty old at this point,” said Luka Arreaza, 20, prompting laughter from those waiting in line beside him. “So it was really worth it to come here and share this moment.”The band, formed when they were at school in Oxfordshire in 1985, have become a byword for cerebral, atmospheric – and non-fans would say morose – rock music. They are still easily able to fill arenas thanks to a run of nine studio albums ranging from solid to utterly classic.View image in fullscreenRadiohead in 1997.Photograph: Roger Sargent/ShutterstockTheir debut, 1994’s Pablo Honey, contained their breakthrough hit Creep, which has spent much of the last four months back in the UK Top 100 as the band earn a new generation of fans. Let Down, from third album OK Computer, also re-entered the charts this year.OK Computer is regarded by many critics as the greatest rock album of the 1990s, though if anything the esteem is even higher for its follow-up Kid A, for which the band stretched out further into electronic music.Their sixth, 2007’s In Rainbows (made available via a download that fans could set their own price for) is regarded as another creative pinnacle, but the band’s sense of adventure was clearly still felt on the albums since, The King of Limbs (2011) and A Moon Shaped Pool (2016).Yorke has put out a series of solo and group albums, mostly recently with his trio the Smile, alongsideJonny Greenwood(lead guitar/keyboards).Greenwood has found huge success as a film composer, earning two Oscar nominations for Phantom Thread and The Power of the Dog, and may get a third for the critically adored One Battle After Another, the fifth of his collaborations with director Paul Thomas Anderson.Guitarist Ed O’Brien released his debut solo album in 2020, and drummer Phil Selway released his third in 2023. Bassist Colin Greenwood has been a sideman for artists including Nick Cave, and in 2024 he published How to Disappear: a Portrait of Radiohead, a book of his photographs of Radiohead taken between 2003 and 2016.Another waiting fan was Sergio Zapater, who had arrived luggage in hand after taking a morning train from Valencia.The last time the 53-year-old had seen Radiohead was 22 years ago. This time, he had arrived at the venue more than nine hours before the concert was due to start, certain that he would be the first in line.Instead he found himself confronted by the fact that a new generation – one that seemingly did not mind early hours or queues – had fallen for Radiohead’s “evolved, elaborate, soul-touching” tunes.“I was surprised to find all these young people here,” he said with a laugh. “How annoying, I thought I would be first in line because older people don’t do these things. But now I’m 25th.”After four nights in Madrid, Radiohead’s tour will travel to Bologna, London, Copenhagen and Berlin, concluding on 12 December.Explore more on these topicsRadioheadSpainThom YorkeJonny GreenwoodEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Over the decades, it has becomea major touristdraw for Bavaria’s state capital.Largest during the winter months – when ice melt can push the wave up to one metre high – the river is now officially managed, including being drained once a year to clean away debris and inspect the streambed.View image in fullscreenPeople look at the spot where there once was the Eisbach wave in Munich.Photograph: Michael Nguyen/NurPhoto/ShutterstockBut after torrents were released back into the canal following its cleanup on Friday, the Eisbach wave did not form as usual, instead leaving unstable white water rapids.“We’re at a loss,” surfer Klaus Rudolftold Stern magazine. “I was standing at the edge with my board on Friday evening and couldn’t believe it.”Authorities were looking into the cause of the wave’s disappearance, including whether it could be due to the cleaning or a lack of water.“No structural changes were made to the Eisbach wave or its banks during the cleanup,” the city said. An inspection of the site on Monday also did not reveal any damage.On Tuesday, Mayor Dieter Reiter said in a statement that the city administration was “working with the Water Management Office and surfers to find a quick solution so that the famous surf wave will soon be available again as usual”.Officials now plan to divert more water into the canal in hopes of a reappearance of the Eisbach, which SurferToday.comdescribesas “the mother of all river waves”. Standing waves require delicately balanced water levels and speeds.The Eisbach wave closed earlier this year for several months after the death of a 33-year-old Munich woman who became trapped under the surface at night. Since it reopened, new rules have banned night-time surfing.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeSurfingRiversnewsShareReuse this content"

So,it’s now really up to the EU to adopt a decision and to move forward,” Sandu said.“There are solutions, but again, these are to be taken by the EU member states and by the EU institutions. It’s not easy, butif the EU becomes a little bit more creative and if you want to solve this issue. I’m sure it can solve it,” she said.In a stark warning, she said the pro-EU politicians managed to beat Russian disinformation and win the EU referendum, the presidential election and the parliamentary election in the last 24 months, but “if we don’t deliver in the next three years– we have the presidential elections in three years – …then what’s going to be the message to the people?”ShareUpdated at09.39 EST"

Those who refused to return could face deportation “in the near future”.He appeared to contradict his foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, who after a visit to Damascus last week expressed doubt that many Syrians would choose to return given the devastation and ongoing instability, which he said made a dignified existence hard to imagine.Wadephul had previously taken a tougher stance, supporting the government’s line as it seeks to stave off the rise of the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).His apparent rethink drew criticism from some of his colleagues in the Christian Democratic Union, some of whom said he was discouraging the return of those who would be needed to rebuild their country.What few politicians want to touch on is the effect deportations might have on Germany, where hundreds of thousands of Syrians haveintegrated successfully, learning the language and joining the workforce– which is crying out for recruits at a time when the German population is rapidly ageing.More than 7,000 Syrian doctors are employed in the health sector, often in rural regions that have been poorly served in recent decades.Many of the 1.3 million Syrians living in Germany, almost a quarter of whom were born in their adopted home, have obtained citizenship, though the majority only hold temporary residence permits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The incident was the latest in a series of prominent events that have triggered public concerns over security and migration.Wadephul’s empathetic remarks towards Syrians were seized upon by the AfD’s co-leader Alice Weidel, who called them “a slap in the face to the victims of Islamist violence”.Merz said on Monday he had invited Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, to Germany to discuss the deportation of Syrians with criminal records, which has been a topic of debate in Germany for some time.Wadephul sought to paper over the perceived differences between his and Merz’s position, saying on Tuesday that he was actively involved in pursuing the goal shared by the entire government of increasing the number of deportations of migrants, including of people from Syria.Explore more on these topicsGermanySyriaEuropeMigrationRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

We call for the defence of the same democracy as they did at a time when it is under threat around the world.”This month is the 50th anniversary of the death ofFrancisco Franco, whose coup in July 1936 triggered the three-year conflict.Jim Jump, the chair of the International Brigade Memorial Trust in London, said: “The Spanish government’s decision underlines its determination to erase the toxic legacy of the Franco dictatorship. Many families of International Brigaders continued to campaign for the restoration of democracy inSpainduring those dark years.“Spanish citizenship for them fulfils the spirit of the historic pledge made by the Spanish Republic to offer a home for the Brigaders.”One of those to receive citizenship is Peter Crome, a retired professor of geriatric medicine and son of Len Crome, who served as a doctor in the International Brigades at Jarama, near Madrid, and during the Battle of the Ebro.View image in fullscreenLen Crome served in the second world war after his time with the International Brigades.Photograph: Peter CromeCrome was born in Latvia, then part of the Russian empire, and came to Britain in 1926 where he studied medicine in Edinburgh.“He was what today you’d call a lefty but he wasn’t a member of a political party,” Peter Crome said. “He was concerned about the rise of fascism and antisemitism. In common with many others, those were the factors that led him to Spain.”Len Crome was a polyglot who spoke Russian and German among other languages and so was able to communicate with many of the volunteers who came from all over the world. As a result, by the time the brigades were withdrawn late in 1938, he had been promoted to chief medical officer.On his return to Britain, he anticipated the war with Germany and applied to join the territorial army. However, he was rejected on the grounds that he didn’t have a British father and as such “was now eligible for removal from the UK”.Peter believes that rejection and his experiences in Spain were what led his father to join the Communist party.His suspect parentage did not stop him from being conscripted later in the war where he once again served as a doctor and was awarded the military cross for bravery in Italy at the Battle of Monte Cassino.Peter Crome said this recognition of the volunteers’ descendants is the fruit of a long campaign by groups in Spain and elsewhere. Between 2009 and 2013, citizenship was granted to 23 of the then surviving members of the International Brigades.View image in fullscreenVolunteers of the International Brigades being trained in Albacete, Spain, in 1937.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyThe government has alsotaken further steps to outlaw the National Francisco Franco Foundation, giving it 10 days to refute the accusation that its goals and activities run counter to the spirit of the democratic memory law because they promote “an apologia for Francoism” and “demean the victims’ dignity”. Once the deadline has passed, judicial proceedings will begin.The government is expected to pass a royal decree later this month calling for the removal of pro-fascist symbols and other relics of the dictatorship “so that they can be removed once and for all from our streets, squares, villages and cities, without excuses or delays”, Sánchez said.Spain expresses regret over ‘injustice’ suffered by Mexico’s Indigenous people during conquestRead moreIn addition to honouring the international volunteers, the government also recognised its “debt of gratitude” to 18 victims of the dictatorship, among them the poetFederico García Lorca, who was murdered in 1936, and the film-maker Luis Buñuel, who was exiled and had his work censored in Spain.Laura García Lorca, the poet’s niece, said: “On receiving this recognition today, we think not only of Federico but also the tens of thousands of women and men who lost their lives, their freedom or their freedom of expression, who were shot by firing squads, imprisoned, exiled, purged or condemned to silence.”Among the lesser-known figures honoured during the ceremony were Margot Moles Piña, a pioneer of women’s sport in Spain, and the trade unionist Antonio Menchén Bartolomé. María Luisa Ramos Barril, 98, who was deported to the Mauthausen concentration camp in 1940, was present to receive the award.Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropeFrancisco FranconewsShareReuse this content"

He was 84.Cheney at various times held the roles of member of Congress, White House chief of staff and secretary of defense, but it was as one of the country’s most powerful vice-presidents that he had the biggest impact, wielding great influence over the less experienced Bush.Dick Cheney remembered as steady, influential force in US politicsRead moreCheney was in office on 11 September 2001 during the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. While Bush was hurried to safety, Cheney worked with the defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, toassume policy control. Troops were soon in Afghanistan, fighting the Taliban and hunting al-Qaida.But Cheney’s place in history will be dominated by the decision to invadeIraq. He had been defense secretary during the first Gulf war against Saddam Hussein, in 1990 and 1991, but now Cheney and Bush’s public rationale for war was that the Iraqi dictator was linked to al-Qaida and thus 9/11, and possessed weapons of mass destruction. By March 2003, when US and coalition forces invaded, no proof had been found for either charge, and both were soon proved false.Although Cheney sought international cooperation, he also thought,he later wrote, that the Bush administration “had an obligation to do whatever it took to defend America”.View image in fullscreenGeorge W Bush and Cheney embrace following Bush’s acceptance speech during the final night of the Republican national convention in 2004.Photograph: Charles Dharapak/APThe death toll was high.Accordingto the Watson School of International and Public Affairs at Brown University, since 2001 “at least 800,000 people have been killed by direct war violence in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and Pakistan”.The treatment of prisoners taken by the US in its “war on terror” also provedhugely controversial. Out of office, Cheney continued todefendthe use of torture against detainees after 9/11.A Yale dropout who avoided service in Vietnam, Cheney nonetheless became a giant of Republican politics.He was a White House aide under Richard Nixon; the youngest ever White House chief of staff, to Gerald Ford; a member of Congress under Ronald Reagan; secretary of defense toGeorge HW Bush, and vice-president to George W Bush.When the younger Bush plucked him from theHalliburton corporationto be his running mate in the 2000 presidential election, Cheney had already survived three heart attacks. Nor was he immune to mishap: once, while vice-president, heshot a hunting partnerin the face.2:04A look back on the legacy of former US vice-president Dick Cheney – videoCheney underwent a successful heart transplant in 2012, after suffering premature heart disease, but was an “incredibly easy” patient to deal with, his long-term physician Jonathan Reiner told CNN.The former-vice president was “never concerned about what people knew about his heart disease. He was very open about it,” Reiner said. “He was the easiest patient, unbelievably compliant. And I think that’s one of the reasons why he was able to live such a long and full life.”Cheney’s daughter, Liz Cheney, followed him into Republican politics as a US House representative from Wyoming in the same seat her father had held while a congressman, but she was censured by the party after strongly criticising Donald Trump over the January 6 insurrection.View image in fullscreenDick Cheney and his daughter Liz arrive to vote at the Teton county library, Wyoming, during the Republican primary election in August 2022.Photograph: Jabin Botsford/APThe elder Cheney also attended an event to mark the first anniversary of the attack alongside his daughter, where he expressed “deep disappointment” in Republican party leadership, saying: “It’s not a leadership that resembles any of the folks that I knew when I was here for 10 years” and that “you can’t overestimate how important [January 6] is”.Cheney announced in 2024 that he would vote for Kamala Harris rather than the Republican nominee Trump, saying that “in our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump” and that he felt a duty to “put country above partisanship to defend our constitution”.Speaking to the Guardian in 2018, on the release of Vice, a darkly comic biopic starring Christian Bale, the Cheney biographer Jake Bernstein said: “There has been some rehabilitation with George W Bush. In comparison with Donald Trump, everyone starts to look better. ButDick Cheneyliked the fact everyone called him Darth Vader.

The Israeli prison service has repeatedly denied the use of torture in its jails.View image in fullscreenPeople in Gaza gathering to greet freed Palestinian prisoners after their release from Israeli jails last month.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APSpeaking by phone from Egypt, Abu Srour also described the “dizzying shock” of being driven straight from the brutal conditions of Israeli incarceration to a five-star hotel in Cairo as guests of the Egyptian authorities.As a young man, Abu Srour took part in the first intifada, the Palestinian uprising between 1987 and 1993, when he was charged as an accomplice in the death of an Israeli Shin Bet security police officer who had been trying to press Abu Srour’s cousin into becoming a collaborator.View image in fullscreenNasser Abu Srour.Photograph: GallimardOn the basis of a confession he made under torture, Abu Srour was sentenced in 1993 to life in prison without parole. During decades marked by extended periods of solitary confinement, he gained a bachelor’s degree and then a master’s in political science and began to publish poetry and other writings that were smuggled out of prison.His prison memoir,The Tale of a Wall: Reflections on Hope and Freedom, was mostly dictated in phone conversations with a relative over more than two years. It has been translated from Arabic for publication in seven languages and is a finalist for theArab literature prizeawarded each year by the Institute of the Arab World in Paris.Appeals for his release went unheeded over the decades, so when officials came to the prison after the 10 October ceasefire with a list of prisoners to be freed, Abu Srour tried to ignore them.“They were calling out cell numbers and I was sitting on my bed in room No 6 feeling like I am not part of it,” he said. “There were so many times when I should have been part of it over all those years. But the whole thing is so huge and so painful, I didn’t want to interact. It was a defence mechanism. I was saying it has nothing to do with me.“But then they came to my cell and they said: ‘Nasser, prepare yourself.’ God’s grace finally reached me. My friends were hugging and kissing me and I was in disbelief.”Abu Srour said that after the outbreak of the Gaza war, triggered by the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, the treatment of long-term Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails worsened significantly.“Any place where there are no cameras was a place for brutality,” he said. “They would tie our hands behind our heads and throw us on the floor and then they would start trampling on us with their feet.”Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has boasted that under his control Israeli prisons areno longer “holiday camps”. Abu Srour said all reading and writing materials were withdrawn under the regime.View image in fullscreenVehicles outside the Israeli Ofer military prison before last month’s prisoner release.Photograph: Ammar Awad/Reuters“All cultural life in the prison ended in the last two years, so there was only biological life. Everyone tried to survive in their own way. And we were always hungry,” he said. Daily rations were maintained at the level of bare survival and he said he lost 12kg in weight.Prisoners were allowed only one set of thin clothes, so they were always cold on winter nights. “Our bodies were weak. We couldn’t handle even a medium temperature,” he said. “Whenever someone was leaving prison, everyone would try to become their friends so they would get their T-shirt or underwear, or anything.”Abu Srour said that in the 24 hours before the prisoners to be freed under the ceasefire were named and boarded buses to leave, they were subjected to a particularly intense final round of beatings.On the 48-hour journey that followed, they were not allowed to open the curtains on the buses that crossed Israel and then drove along the southern edge of Gaza to the Rafah crossing with Egypt. It was only after entering Egypt that he saw the sky for the first time outside prison confines.The buses deposited the 154 freed prisoners at a luxury Cairo hotel, which brought shocks of its own. “I’d never been to a hotel before. I did everything for the first time like a child, to get in and out of a lift, to learn about room service, how to perceive or use a shower,” Abu Srour said.Part of the shock was meeting four of his sisters and a brother for the first time in decades. “This was another reason for stress for me … We’ve been apart for like 33 years. It felt cruel because it had been denied for so long,” he said. He remembers thinking: “Is it OK to hug them?”The freed prisoners were watched by Egyptian security officials as they mingled with tourists, and took their cues from them on how to act.“In the morning we saw the buffet and we saw all that food. So the guys all put 2kg of food on their plate. It was a surreal scene. We were embarrassed. We did not know what to do with our knife and fork,” Abu Srour said. “All my feelings were mixed and tense. I was embarrassed. I am at a loss with my language, unable to give meanings for things around me.”On Saturday, after the Daily Mail published a story revealing the presence of freed Palestinian prisoners among western tourists in what it called the “Hotel Hamas”, the group were given two hours to pack their things before being bussed to another hotel in the desert, an hour’s drive from the capital.That abrupt move, of being ordered on to buses to be taken to an unknown location chosen by others, was a reminder for Abu Srour that they were not yet free.He has been offered several options of third countries willing to accept him on a longer-term basis and is trying to decide where to go on the grounds of accessibility for his family, and whether he will be able to continue writing.“I don’t want a comfortable country,” he said. “I don’t want a country without questions or a country without a cause.”Explore more on these topicsPalestineIsraelIsrael-Gaza warEgyptMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It has asked parents who have received the letter to call the phone number on it, promising swift resolution by a new dedicated customer service team.It also said it was confident the majority of payments had been correctly suspended.Hillier wants to know what assurances parents will have that this will not happen again.“Is anyone who did not board a flight, train or ferry leaving the UK this year at risk of being considered to have emigrated?” she asked.Addressing many people’s concerns that individuals’ tax records have been tainted, she added: “Will HMRC’s assessment of emigration status affect individuals for the purposes of immigration, or non-domiciled tax status?”HMRC pauses child benefit crackdown after 23,500 families caught up in data errorRead moreOther questions in the list of 14 demands include how long was HMRC using travel booking data to “establish emigration status”. MPs also want to know why it used booking data, and not boarding data.They have also asked how HMRC came to determine emigration status when travel operators have no idea who is resident in the UK or not: “Given travel operators do not hold the national insurance numbers of passengers, how did HMRC verify it was halting payments of the correct recipients?”The committee, which will publish the answers, also wants to know what level of seniority was involved in the signoff of the anti-fraud initiative and what safeguards had been put in place to stop innocent victims being caught up in the crackdown.This week, several parents told the Guardian they had received a letter from HMRC despite not receiving child benefit for months, or in one case years.Several complained that they felt they were “being treated like criminals” when they had paid tax all their lives and HMRC could have simply checked tax records to see if they were living and paying tax in the UK.Another woman, who had previously suffered a stroke, said the letter was very distressing.“This kind of traumatic situation can cause a severe health breakdown with people like me who already had a minor stroke. Having to deal with providing A to Z information to prove that I haven’t been abroad is a lot of weight on top of tons of stress which is already part of our lives,” said Rachel.An HMRC spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry to those whose payments have been suspended incorrectly. Having reviewed our processes, we are now checking claims with customers first before suspending any payments, giving them one month to call us or write back.“We have a duty to protect taxpayers’ money, but we have also listened to our customers and taken swift action to ensure claims are only suspended when appropriate.”If you have beenaffected by this and want to share your story, email: lisa.ocarroll@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsChild benefitsBenefitsWelfareHMRCCommunitiesParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

It heard more than 7,000 responses from the public, with evidence considered by an expert panel appointed by Francis, leading to the publication of its 197-page report.Key recommendations include:1.Shorten GCSEsThe length of GCSE exams should be shrunk by 10%, which could shave about three hours off for each pupil. The review found evidence that England is an international outlier in the “excessive” length and number of exams taken by its 16-year-olds, and argues that exams could be shortened without any loss of rigour.2.Slim down GCSE contentIndividual GCSE subject content should be slimmed down, particularly in history and sciences, to give pupils more time for non-assessed but mandatory subjects such as PE, citizenship and relationships, sex and health education.3.Scrap the English baccalaureate suiteThe English baccalaureate suite of GCSE subjects introduced by Michael Gove, which was designed to steer pupils towards eight core academic subjects but excluded arts or vocational subjects, should be scrapped. The measure has long been opposed by arts and creative educators.4.More focus on social diversityStronger representation should be made of “the diversity that makes up our modern society, allowing more children to see themselves in the curriculum”.5.Expand REReligious education should be made part of the national curriculum at all stages, taking its content out of the hands of local advisory councils. The review heard evidence that RE provision in many schools “is not good enough and does not prepare pupils adequately for life beyond school”.6.New diagnostic test in maths and EnglishA new diagnostic test in maths and English to support teachers in identifying gaps in pupils’ knowledge at year 8 should be introduced, ensuring more students are supported to progress successfully. Teaching unions, however, oppose such a move, and the government has recently proposed its own national reading tests to take place in year 8.7.Statutory citizenship classesThe government should introduce a statutory measure to ensure that all children are taught citizenship classes at primary school, which should include elements of financial and media literacy, and climate change and sustainability.8.Review primary grammar teaching and testingGrammar teaching and testing in primary school should be reviewed to determine what content should be removed entirely to enable a greater focus on grammar and writing rather than grammar in theory.9.Replace computing science GCSEThe current computing science GCSE should be replaced with a broader GCSE in computing that prepares young people “for applying digital technology and data across a wide range of fields”, including the use of artificial intelligence.10.Allow students to take ‘triple science’ at GCSEThe government should introduce an entitlement that allows any student to take “triple science” of individual biology, physics and chemistry courses at GCSE, rather than double science.Explore more on these topicsNational curriculumPrimary schoolsSecondary schoolsCurriculumsSchoolsTeachingEducation policynewsShareReuse this content"

Jared’s passion forSpace, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era. Congratulations to Jared, his wife Monica, and their children, Mila and Liv,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday.The move comes several months after Trumpwithdrew an initial nominationof Isaacman – an ally of the billionaire Elon Musk – for the same role back in May. Just one week before Isaacman’s confirmation, Trump posted: “After a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head Nasa. I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be mission aligned, and put America first in space.”Isaacman’s initial nomination removal was just days after Musk’s officialdeparture from the White House, the SpaceX CEO’s role as a “special government employee” leading the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) having created turbulence for the administration and frustrated some of Trump’s aides.The president later appointed Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, to be actingNasaadministrator instead, pending the choice of a permanent space agency chief. In his renewal post, Trump addressed Duffy’s service briefly, writing: “Sean Duffy has done an incredible job as Interim Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).”Isaacman, the former CEO of the payment processor company Shift4, has broad space industry support but has drawn concerns from lawmakers over his ties to Musk andSpaceX, where he spent hundreds of millions of dollars as an early private spaceflight customer.He donated to Democrats in prior elections. In his confirmation hearing in April, he sought to balance Nasa’s existing moon-aligned space exploration strategy with pressure to shift the agency’s focus on Mars, saying the US can plan for travel to both destinations.As the soon-to-be leader of Nasa’s 18,000 employees, Isaacman faces a daunting task of implementing that decision to prioritize Mars, given that Nasa has spent years and billions of dollars trying to return its astronauts to the moon.In response to Trump’s renomination, Isaacman shared a note of thanks on X andsaid: “The support from the space-loving community has been overwhelming. I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.“To the innovators building the orbital economy, to the scientists pursuing breakthrough discoveries and to dreamers across the world eager for a return to the Moon and the grand journey beyond--these are the most exciting times since the dawn of the space age-- and I truly believe the future we have all been waiting for will soon become reality.“And to the best and brightest at NASA, and to all the commercial and international partners, we have an extraordinary responsibility--but the clock is running. The journey is never easy, but it is time to inspire the world once again to achieve the near-impossible--to undertake and accomplish big, bold endeavors in space...and when we do, we will make life better here at home and challenge the next generation to go even further. NASA will never be a caretaker of history--but will forever make history.”Explore more on these topicsNasaDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsSpaceSpaceXElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Inside the $3tn AI datacentre spending spreeRead moreThe warning from Norges Bank, which is the seventh biggest single shareholder in Tesla with a stake worth $17bn, comes two days before the carmaker hosts its annual shareholder meeting.On Thursday, investors will vote on proposals for anunprecedented incentive package that could make Elon Musk the world’s first trillionaire.If Musk increases the value of Tesla from about $1tn to $8.5tn over the next 10 years, Musk will receive new shares that would push his stake in the company from nearly 16% to more than 25%.This would increase the fortunes of the world’s richest man to more than $2tn.The Tesla chair, Robyn Denholm, has argued the vote is essential to retain the 54-year-old Musk as chief executive of the company, writing in a letter to shareholders that the company risks losing “significant value” if he were to leave.Last year, the Norwegian oil fund voted against what was then the biggest pay package in US corporate history of $56bn for Musk. The deal was approved by shareholders in June but wasrejected for a second time by a court in Delaware in December.Nicolai Tangen, the chief executive of the Norwegian fund, invited Musk and other chief executives to dinner in Oslo last year. However, Musk turned down the invite after the fund voted against the $56bn pay deal.A text exchange between Tangen and Musk was revealed in a freedom of information request by the Norwegian business publication DN. It reported that Musk wrote to Tangen in October last year: “When I ask you for a favour which I very rarely do, and you decline, then you should not ask me for one until you’ve done something above nothing to make amends. Friends are as friends do.”Shareholders are divided on the new deal, although two influential shareholder advisory groups – Glass Lewis and ISS – have both recommended that investors reject the $1tn package.Some big pension funds have also opposed the pay package, including the American Federation of Teachers and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest public scheme in the US.Musk, who is Tesla’s biggest single shareholder, can also vote on the proposal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which of those CEOs would you like to run Tesla? It won’t be me.”Tesla has been trying to find ways to keep Musk as chief executive as it grapples with falling sales – global vehicle deliveries fell 13% in the first half of the year. That was partly due to the disruption from the redesign of its popular Model Y car.The carmaker reported a 7% rise in its most recent quarter, as many US consumers rushed to buy electric cars before a $7,500 government purchase incentive ended in September. However, now these tax credits have expired, and the company faces a potential slowdown in its home market.Tesla sales have also been falling across much of Europe: new car registrations dropped 89% in Sweden, 86% in Denmark, 50% inNorwayand 48% in the Netherlands in October, according to local industry data.France was an outlier, where the company made a small gain in sales for the second month in a row.Meanwhile, data from the Chinese Passenger Car Association released on Tuesday, showed that shipments from its Shanghai factory continued to decline, with 61,497 units shipped in October, down about 10% compared with last year.Tesla was approached for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Carmakers in the EU warned last weekthey were “days away” from production stoppages.The trade tensions with the EU are in contrast to the truce struck between China and the US last Thursday.The White House said in its readout after the agreement that Chinawould “eliminate” all “current and proposed export controls on rare earth elements and other critical materials” and end the semiconductor “retaliation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Court documents show the US Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation told the Dutch foreign ministry in June: “The fact that the company’s CEO is still the same Chinese owner is problematic … It is almost certain that the CEO will have to be replaced.”The dispute escalated last week when Nexperia told customersall supplies to its Chinese factory had been suspended. Although Nexperia’s chips are manufactured in Europe, about 70% are packaged in China before distribution.Wingtech said the actions of the Dutch government “appear to be aimed at allowing a new Dutch-owned company to take Nexperia”. It warned that “any Nexperia-successor company is doomed to fail”, adding that “80% of Nexperia’s back-end capacity is within mainland China”.A spokesperson said: “If this matter is not resolved very soon, there will be no company left for customers to return to, and hundreds of people in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK will lose their jobs with many more affected indirectly across Europe. Nexperia’s European employees are very concerned about this, but the company’s senior Dutch management appears oblivious to these concerns.”The Dutch economic affairs ministry told Reuters that talks between the two governments were still under way. “We remain in contact with the Chinese authorities and our international partners to work toward a constructive solution that is good for Nexperia and our economies,” a spokesperson said.The dispute adds to the turmoil that UK auto manufacturers have faced after a cyber-attack forced Jaguar Land Rover, Britain’s largest carmaker, to halt production in September.JLR has resumed production, supporting asmall boostto UK factories in October.

A spokesperson told the Agence France-Presse news agency the ban applied globally.Outrage in Paris as Shein prepares to open its first permanent storeRead moreShein’s executive chair, Donald Tang, said: “These publications came from third-party vendors but I take personal responsibility.”Only days before Shein was due toopen its first physical store in Paris, France’s finance minister threatened to ban the retailer from the country if it continued selling the childlike dolls.The Paris prosecutors’ office said it had opened investigations against Shein and other online retailers over the sale of sex dolls. France’s anti-fraud unit reported on Saturday that Shein was selling “childlike” dolls of a likely pornographic nature.The French daily Le Parisien published a photo of one of the dolls sold on the platform. The pictured doll measured around 80cm (30in) in height and held a teddy bear.Shortly after the fraud watchdog’s statement, Shein announced that the dolls had been withdrawn from its platform and it had launched an internal inquiry. Soon after, it announced the ban on sex dolls.Shein said it was setting up a dedicated team to ensure the “integrity” of content on the sales platform.Shein is due on Wednesday to open its first physical store in the world inside the prestigious BHV Marais department store in central Paris, a move that hassparked outrage in France.Frédéric Merlin, the director of the company that owns BHV, said selling the childlike dolls was “unacceptable”, but on Monday he defended his decision to allow Shein into the department store.“Only clothes and items conceived directly by Shein for BHV will be sold in store,” he said.Shein, a Singapore-based company that was founded in China, has facedcriticism over working conditionsat its factories and the environmental impact of its ultra-fast-fashion business model.France has already fined Shein three times in 2025 for a total of 191m euros ($220m). Those sanctions were imposed for failing to comply with online cookie legislation, false advertising, misleading information and not declaring the presence of plastic microfibres in its products.The European Commission is also investigating Shein over risks linked to allegedly illegal products, while EU lawmakers have approved legislation aimed at curbing the environmental impact of fast fashion.Explore more on these topicsSheinFranceRetail industryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Liverpool of Arne Slot’s title‑winning debut season was the answer and, on their second successive November visit,Real Madriddid not have one of their own.Alexis Mac Allister opened the scoringlast season in the 2-0 defeatof the Spanish giants – though giant would be a huge exaggeration of their latest display on Merseyside – and settled the reunion of the European heavyweights as Liverpool, all controlled aggression and clear‑eyed intent, ignited their Champions League campaign and potentially their entire season. Another clean sheet and set-piece goal heightened Slot’s satisfaction on a raucous, reaffirming night at Anfield.Arne Slot turns focus to Manchester City clash after ‘impressive’ Real Madrid winRead moreXabi Alonso’s team were a distant second, the stellar names of Kylian Mbappé, Jude Bellingham and Vinícius Júnior confined to the margins throughout, and only Thibaut Courtois’s latest commanding display againstLiverpoolprevented a more emphatic victory. Alonso was booked on his return to Anfield. Trent Alexander-Arnold, his mural near Anfield vandalised earlier in the day, had his every touch booed after an 81st‑minute introduction.A late passage of play encapsulated the enjoyment Liverpool took from the game. An aimless cross by Alexander-Arnold was shepherded out of play on the opposite side of the pitch by his successor as Liverpool right back, Conor Bradley. The outstanding Bradley bumped Vinícius up in the air and out of his way for good measure.Fun was not the only feature to return at Anfield. Liverpool performed with an intensity, belief and organisation reminiscent of when they met Real 12 months ago. On that occasion Slot’s side carried with them the momentum from 13 wins in a 14-game unbeaten run. The circumstances were far removed here. This was a test of whetherthe win against Aston Villaon Saturday represented a fleeting recovery or one with substance. The signs were immediately encouraging for Slot and they would be sustained.Real did not get out of their half for the first five minutes as Liverpool started on the front foot. Florian Wirtz was to the fore on his recall and created the first chance when dispossessing Dean Huijsen near the corner flag. Mac Allister side-footed over, to his obvious disgust, but the tone for a thoroughly committed performance had been set.Bradley also laid an early marker in his personal battle with Vinícius. The Northern Ireland international again thrived against the illustrious names from Madrid. Last season he ignited the Anfield crowd with a thunderous challenge on Mbappé. Now he engaged in a running feud with Vinícius that drove the Brazilian to distraction at times. The Real forward was booked for hauling down Bradley as he surged into the visitors’ half and later performed a pathetic dive inside the Liverpool area when accidentally, and lightly, touched in the face by the full‑back.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold was booed after being introduced as a substitute.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters“One Conor Bradley” reverberated around the stadium although, of course, for more reason than the young defender’s finest display of the season. Alexander-Arnold’s first appearance at Anfield since his acrimonious summer departure added another intriguing subplot. The boos were mild when he appeared for the warm-up but cranked up in volume and venom when he entered the contest.For almost an hour it seemed that Liverpool’s ghost from the 2022Champions Leaguefinal, Courtois, would haunt them again. Wirtz seized on a careless touch by Huijsen to break free and squared perfectly for Dominik Szoboszlai as he arrived unmarked in the area. The midfielder connected cleanly but Courtois spread himself superbly to save at point-blank range.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Hungarian’s drive struck Aurélien Tchouaméni on the hand as he dived in to block. The referee, Istvan Kovacs, awarded a free-kick on the edge of the area but the France international was clearly inside when making contact with the ball. A spot-kick appeared imminent when Kovacs was sent to the pitch‑side monitor but he rejected the penalty claim and overturned the free-kick. Tchouaméni’s arms were in a natural position, apparently. Anfield reacted with understandable fury.The controversy emboldened Slot’s side more than the Spanish league leaders. Giorgi Mamardashvili saved from Bellingham and Arda Guler in quick succession but Courtois remained the busier keeper by far. Szoboszlai was denied twice by Real’s No 1 before the break, Mac Allister too, and Courtois’s one-man stand continued after the restart. Virgil van Dijk could only laugh when his close-range header from a Wirtz corner was tipped over. Courtois repeated the trick when the resulting corner from Szoboszlai was headed goalwards by Hugo Ekitiké.Courtois’s resistance was finally broken after Bellingham picked up a booking for fouling Ryan Gravenberch on the right. Conceding cheap free‑kicks was Real’s biggest failing on the night, according to Alonso. Szoboszlai swept over a powerful set‑piece – Alexander‑Arnold might have taken it had he stayed – and the improving Mac Allister bulleted a header through the goalkeeper’s guard. VAR intervened again to check a potential offside against the goalscorer. Anfield would not be enraged this time.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueLiverpoolReal MadridEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Gardner, the No 4 overall pick in the 2022 draft, has quickly established himself as one of the league’s premier defenders, earning All-Pro honors in each of his first two years.“New York it’s been real,” Gardner posted with a green heart emojion X.New York it's been real💚— SAUCE GARDNER (@iamSauceGardner)November 4, 2025The move comes just months after Gardner signed a four-year, $120.4m extension with the Jets – a deal that made him one of the highest-paid cornerbacks inNFLhistory. His departure signals a major shift for New York’s defense, which was built around his lockdown coverage skills. The Jets look set for a rebuild after slumping to a 1-7 record this season. The franchise has not made the playoffs since the 2010 season, the longest drought in the NFL.For the 7-2 Colts, the trade represents a clear push toward Super Bowl contention. With Gardner joining a secondary that already ranks among the league’s top units, Indianapolis are betting big on an elite defense to power their playoff run.It was the first of two massive trades by Jets general manager Darren Mougey before the deadline Tuesday. New York also agreed to trade defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys for a second-round pick in 2026, a first-round pick in 2027 and defensive tackle Mazi Smith, two people with knowledge of the deal told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the teams hadn’t announced the trade.Elsewhere, the Cowboys acquired linebacker Logan Wilson from the Cincinnati Bengals for a seventh-round pick on Tuesday. Hours beforethe Cowboys lost to the Arizona Cardinalson Monday night to fall to 3-5-1, owner Jerry Jones said the team had a deal in place to add a player who could improve the defense.Wilson had requested a trade after his playing time decreased for the Bengals, who have the league’s worst defense. The Cowboys traded two-time All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons to Green Bay before the season, leaving a huge void that Wilson doesn’t fill.“Some guys have the ability to see a certain key and, at the same time, take a step up in the hole,” Jones said on his radio show on 105.3 The Fan. “He knows how to get in the gaps right now. ... For what we need right now, he can come in immediately and help us at linebacker.”Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman, who led the Cowboys to three Super Bowls in the 1990s, mocked the deal during the ESPN broadcast of Monday’s loss to the Cardinals.“He may want to cancel that trade,” Aikman said. “I don’t think one player from what I’ve seen tonight is going to make a difference for this group.”NFL teams had until 4pm EST on Tuesday to make a trade.Meanwhile, the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles have been aggressive. General manager Howie Roseman continues adding players to a talented roster to improve the team’s chances for a repeat.Since the Eagles (6-2) last played a game, they’ve acquired edge rusher Jaelan Phillips and cornerbacks Michael Carter II and Jaire Alexander.Phillips, who came from Miami on Monday for a third-round pick, immediately bolsters the pass rush. The 2021 first-round pick had three sacks in his last five games for the Dolphins. All of Philadelphia’s edge rushers combined have three sacks this season.Carter gives the defense a veteran slot cornerback to allow defensive coordinator Vic Fangio more flexibility to use Cooper DeJean outside. Alexander, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, is a low-risk, high-reward acquisition.The Baltimore Ravens also added an edge rusher, getting Dre’Mont Jones from Tennessee for a conditional fifth-round pick. Jones has 4.5 sacks this season so he’s an upgrade for the Ravens (3-5) at a position of need.Several trades already went down last month. The Bengals acquired Joe Flacco. The Rams got cornerback Roger McCreary. Defensive end Keion White went to the 49ers. Safety Kyle Dugger was traded to the Steelers. The Jaguars and Browns swapped cornerbacks Greg Newsome II and Tyson Campbell.The Chargers added edge Odafe Oweh in a deal that sent safety Alohi Gilman to the Ravens.There are some high-profile players who could be on the move. Bengals All-Pro edge rusher Trey Hendrickson and Jets running back Breece Hall are among the biggest names being mentioned in trade speculation.Explore more on these topicsNFLIndianapolis ColtsNew York JetsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Until now, LIV has proudly operated over 54 holes and three days, with the name itself partly based on a Roman numeral reference point. Could a rebrand to LXXII be imminent?The dramatic shift, which is believed to have come after pressure from players, means LIV will soon mirror the schedule traditional golf tours it once tried to upstage. LIV will, however, continue to run both individual and team competition elements.Jack Nicklaus wins $50m verdict in defamation case over LIV Golf allegationsRead more“The most successful leagues around the world – IPL, EPL [English Premier League], NBA, MLB, NFL – continue to innovate and evolve their product,” said Scott O’Neil, LIV’s chief executive. “And as an emerging league, we are no different. LIV Golf will always have an eye towards progress that acts in the best interest of LIV Golf and in the best interest of the sport.”A LIV statement added: “For each regular season event, the individual competition will be decided over 72 holes of stroke play, while the team competition will continue to run concurrently, with each team’s cumulative individual stroke play scores determining the team’s result.”The degree of “innovation” to which O’Neil refers will raise eyebrows given four days and 72 holes had been the model in golf’s existing ecosystem before LIV blasted onto the scene, coaxing household nameswith exorbitant contracts. It is understood some players in the LIV environment felt under-prepared for major championships due to the abbreviated nature of their standard playing domain. Umpteen players own equity in LIV teams. Golf’s official world-ranking system has also failed to recognise LIV, a matter which may change under the 72-hole model.“LIV Golf is a player’s league,” said the two-time major winner Jon Rahm. “We are competitors to the core and we want every opportunity to compete at the highest level and to perfect our craft. Moving to 72 holes is the logical next step that strengthens the competition, tests us more fully, and if the growing galleries from last season are any indication, delivers more of what the fans want.”Dustin Johnson added: “Playing 72 holes just feels a little more like the big tournaments we’ve all grown up playing.” Johnson, also a double major winner, has not finished in the top 10 in one of the big four events since 2023.All of this presents something of a public relations quandary. O’Neil’s predecessor, Greg Norman, explained two years ago why LIV had been given that precise name. The Australian said: “It is the Roman numeral for 54, which has two meanings: 54 is the lowest score you could shoot if you were to birdie every hole on a par 72 course, so there is an aspirational aspect to the thinking. It is also the number of holes to be played in each event.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So why the panic about trans players?Lesley RyderAngel City’s Elizabeth Eddy was rebuked by her own teammates for an op-ed on trans players. It’s easy to understand their objectionsTue 4 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 09.12 ESTShareOn 26 October, Angel City FC’s Elizabeth Eddy made her first post on X in nearly two years. In it, Eddy in essence responded to the Guardian’s report that the NWSL hadquietly droppedits inclusion policy for trans and intersex athletes, leaving the league’s future stance on the matter undecided.The New York Post gave Eddy’s writing a signal boost the next day,republishing it in full.“I’m concerned that without clarity about who the league is for, it will lose its identity and its momentum,” Eddy wrote in the piece, which broadly advocated for a ban on trans athletes from theNWSL, to protect “the integrity of women’s sports” so the league does not lose “its identity and its momentum.”The US’s biggest pro women’s sports unions have found strength togetherRead moreIt’s unclear how Eddy thinks the NWSL’s integrity has been harmed – either under its former policy that allowed trans athletes in the league, or its current lack of one. The league, now in its 13th season, has developed a clear identity. It’s highly competitive. It’s commercially and culturally powerful. It’s, well, anintegralpart of the global women’s soccer scene. The league’s momentum appears to be largely fine, too – to pick just two data points, viewership has grown every season, and in 2026 the league will expand to 16 teams, nearly doubling its size in the last five years.Eddy cites the English FA’srecent banon transgender athletes from women’s soccer as a success story. Yet England’sbanis believed to affect only 20 or so grassroots players out of 5.5 million registered athletes. There’s reason to believe the effect would be similarly negligible here in the US. In 2021, when the league’s trans inclusion policy took effect, the NWSL hadtwotrans players: Quinn and Kumi Yokoyama. Both have since left, and no out trans players currently play in the league. On the 2025 season’s opening weekend, the league welcomed its1,000thplayer. That’s just two out trans players out of over 1,000 in league history.Eddy’s piece is written as if there is a pipeline of trans players set to take over the league at a moment’s notice. There is no such thing. There are currently no out trans players competing at a professional level in the United States. Federal legislation expresslyprohibitstrans players from competing in NCAA college soccer. And aside from all that, multiple peer-reviewedstudieshave shown that trans athletes have no biological advantages over cis athletes.In the absence of out trans people, transphobic attacks have continued along racial lines. When the Orlando Pride’s Barbra Banda was named the BBC’s player of the year, a wave of online abuse followed. The NWSL waspainfully slowto act in support of their star player. The Kansas City Current’sTemwa Chawingaand her sister Tabitha have experienced similar abuse. It’s all derived either from the fraught world of gender testing standards, the players not looking outwardly feminine enough to some, or some combination of both those factors.In her piece, Eddy does manage to identify that there is harm in legislating bodies in this way, saying “This uncertainty serves no one, as questions and controversy abound over intersex and transgender athletes.”But she doesn’t seem to realize how her op-ed further enables those harms. AsSuzanne Wrack put itin the Guardian earlier this year: “What the hysteria over an almost impossible hypothetical situation does is open the door for transphobic and racist targeting of female football players and creates an environment that makes trans people, young trans people, or those questioning their gender identity at grassroots level feel as if they don’t belong in football or sport.”This harm is exponentially increased by the New York Post’s shameful decision to run Eddy’s op-ed with a photo of Banda, who like many athletes of color are frequently targeted by transphobic attacks. And Eddy’s own teammates know it.“That article does not speak for this team in this locker room,” Angel City FC captain Sarah Gorden told reporters on Thursday. “We don’t agree with the things written for a plethora of reasons, but mostly the undertones come across as transphobic and racist as well. The article calls for genetic testing on certain players, and it has a photo of an African player as a headline. And that’s very harmful. As a mixed woman, with a Black family, I’m devastated by the undertones of this article … And there are players in this league and in this locker room that are directly harmed by what was written in the article.”Even if one were to ignore all that and believe that trans inclusion constitutes a real problem for the NWSL, it’s hard to see how it would outrank any number of other issues that have actually blunted the league’s momentum and affected its integrity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On-field play resumed, even though players were visibly distraught. The NWSLPA called on the league torevisittheir medical protocols. Then, in August, when a nationally televised match between the Orlando Pride and the KC Current faced an extreme heat delay, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman reportedlythreatenedto fine the Current over a disagreement in the league’s extreme heat procedures.There are more pedestrian, on-field issues too, as European leagues like the WSL grow in financial might enough to start attractingsome of the NWSL’s best playersaway from the league and country where they made their careers.Trans athletes did not factor into any one of these issues.

It’s the beauty of this tournament, you have another chance to prove yourself. Hopefully I can do well in my next one to give myself a chance to stay in this tournament.”Paolini is eliminated having not won a set while Gauff is likely to need to beat world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka to give herself a chance of reaching the semi-finals.Sabalenka prevailed in a tough contest against Pegula to claim her second group match victory of the tournament.The Belarusian earned a straight sets win over Paolini in her opening game, but faced a tight battle against Pegula and eventually clinched a 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 victory.Of her opponent, Sabelenka saluted “an incredible player. She always pushed me to the limit... I was thinking, I’m gonna go after my shots, stay aggressive, put all of that speed back on her and hope that I get my chance.”The US Open champion grew frustrated as she made 13 unforced errors, nearly twice as many as Pegula, as the American got two breaks to build a 5-2 lead before saving two break points to secure the second set.Sabalenka struggled with double faults as Pegula broke early in the third set. However, the world No 1 responded with returns near the sidelines to get two straight breaks, building a 4-2 lead that proved unassailable for Pegula.Sabalenka now has two wins in the Stefanie Graf Group and will face Gauff next, while Pegula comes up against Paolini.PA Media and ReutersShareUpdated at14.23 EST"

This time it included one that stretched back more than 55 years, when Leeds were the last English team not to concede a goal in their opening four matches, in the 1969‑70 European Cup campaign, under Don Revie.A determinedSlavia Pragueside, that came into this game unbeaten in all domestic competitions, gave it their best shot and thought they had been awarded a late penalty, only for the referee to overturn his decision after the video assistant referee called him to the pitchside monitor. The Czech champions finally recorded a shot on target in stoppage time. It meant Arsenal made it eight successive clean sheets in all competitions for the first time since 1903, when they were in what was the Second ­Division. A penalty from Bukayo Saka and two second‑half goals from the makeshift striker Mikel Merino sealed a 10th successive victory for Mikel Arteta’s ruthless side.Tottenham v Copenhagen, PSG v Bayern Munich, and more: Champions League – liveRead more“The most pleasing thing probably is not the record, it’s the mindset of the players. They are talking there about how we can still do better,” the delighted Arsenal manager said. “It’s one or two situations where we could have resolved better. If we do that we can keep improving and that record will have a bigger meaning.”There was also a special moment for Max Dowman as he became the youngest player inChampions Leaguehistory at 15 years 308 days when he was brought on to replace the excellent Leandro Trossard with the points already firmly in the bag.“What he’s done on the pitch, the first ball he takes, he takes people on, he starts to dribble, gets a foul,” Arteta said. “That’s personality, that’s ­courage and you cannot teach that. You have it or you don’t. It doesn’t matter what his passport says. You throw him in this context and he’s able to adapt.”It has been to Arsenal’s immense credit that they have maintained their winning run with so many attacking players missing through injury, with Viktor ­Gyökeres becoming the latest when he limped offagainst Burnley on Saturday. There are fears that the Sweden striker has injured a hamstring but it is hoped he could return with Gabriel ­Martinelli and the captain, Martin Ødegaard, in time for the north London derby againstto play Tottenham after the international break.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka scores from the penalty spot in the first half against Slavia Prague.Photograph: Petr David Josek/APIn the meantime, Merino was back in the role that he filled so ­admirably last season and showed he has lost none of his sharpness in front of goal with two well-taken finishes. ­Christian Nørgaard performed well in place of the suspended Martín ­Zubimendi and Piero Hincapié and Ethan Nwaneri also impressed on rare starts as Arteta rotated his squad.Jindrich Trpisovsky, the Slavia manager, is an experienced character who has won four league titles and he rated Arsenal beforehand as one of the best teams his side have faced, as well as describing Declan Rice as the best free‑kick taker in the world.However, it was the hosts who made the more encouraging start as Arsenal were unsettled by their all‑action pressing game, with 6ft 6in Czech international striker Tomas Chory providing a stiff physical test for their defence. Gabriel Magalhães needed treatment for a facial injury midway through the first half but there was never any chance of him coming off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another Saka shot was just as close and Gabriel was able to make first contact on the resulting corner, with the VAR spotting that Lukas ­Provod’s left arm had been in an unnatural position when he blocked the Brazilian’s goalbound header. Saka made light of the protestations from the home supporters behind the goal and stepped up to coolly give Arsenal the lead.Slavia Prague 0-3 Arsenal: Champions League – live reactionRead moreSlavia thought they should have had a penalty as well just before the break for handball by Hincapié but this time the referee from Azerbaijan was not interested. Any hopes that they could find a way back into the game were dealt a major blow within 40 seconds of the restart. Rice picked out Trossard in acres of space and his cross was volleyed in emphatically at the near post by Merino. This was Arsenal at their clinical best.Merino’s second was a real ­poacher’s finish as he beat ­Markovic to Rice’s cross to loop his header into the empty net. And it has been some week for Dowman, who became the ­youngest player to start a game for Arsenal in the Carabao Cup win against Brighton and has now surpassed Youssoufa Moukoko of Borussia ­Dortmund and his record of 16 years and 18 days set in December 2020. He looked totally at home in these ­surroundings and not even a late scare, when Ben White was penali­sed for a high boot before the VAR intervened again, could stop Arsenal on another perfect evening.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueSlavia PragueArsenalEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Their team had been too good for Copenhagen, who showed virtually nothing – certainly not in a positive sense.Spurs were 2-0 up after Wilson Odobert’s goal but there was a glitch when Brennan Johnson, who had opened the scoring, was sent off in the 57th minute. The foul on Marcos López was more clumsy than sinister yet when the referee, Erik Lambrechts, was advised to go to the pitchside monitor, Johnson’s involvement was over.Mac Allister sinks Real Madrid to ruin Alexander-Arnold’s return to LiverpoolRead moreEnter Micky van de Ven. The centre-half has becomesynonymous with the swashbucklingand he was at it again when he seized possession on the edge of his own penalty box and started to motor. It was a blur as he left four Copenhagen players in his wake, twisting initially to get through the first couple but picking up an inexorable head of steam when he straightened up.Nobody was going to catch him and there was an inevitability, too, about the finish once he got to the edge of the other area, the ball lashed home left-footed past the hapless Copenhagen goalkeeper, Dominik Kotarski. Spurs have their goal of the season already and it was possible to wonder whether it might compete for the more prestigious individual prizes in this area. There were shades ofSon Heung-min versus Burnleyin 2019 – and that one won the Puskas award.It was Van de Ven’s sixth goal of the season and it set Spurs up for a confidence-boosting win, one that took them to eight points from four unbeatenChampions Leagueties. João Palhinha, on as a substitute, added the fourth and they could even shrug off a late penalty miss from another replacement, Richarlison, his shot bouncing down off the crossbar and away.Were the crowd unhappy he took the kick rather than Dane Scarlett, another substitute, who had won it? The pre-match theme had been the ability of those fans to become a little vexed. There were boos for Richarlison as he prepared to step up. But this was not a night for those sort of musings, rather one to celebrate.Xavi Simons needed a performance and delivered; it was just a shame that he was withdrawn after Johnson’s dismissal, Thomas Frank sending on Palhinha. Johnson was good, too, before the red card and if Randal Kolo Muani missed a couple of sitters, he redeemed himself with a fine assist for Odobert.Spurs had been desperate for something on their own turf, the match framed by the horror of the Premier League defeat hereagainst Chelsea on Saturdayand everything that went with it – the continuation of the dismal home league form, the negativity of the fans, a furious Van de Ven blanking Frank at full time, as did Djed Spence. “Micky can keep walking past me if he’s angry after a game,” Frank said with a smile. “It seems like we had Lionel Messi turned into Micky.”View image in fullscreenBrennan Johnson takes the ball past Dominik Kotarski before giving Spurs a first-half lead.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersSpurs made the breakthrough in the 19th minute; the start of a more enjoyable occasion for them. Johnson had blown an early half-chance with a poor first touch but he got everything right when he darted in behind a couple of Copenhagen defenders and was found by a lovely curved ball from Simons.Copenhagen had been caught on a quick transition after Gabriel Pereira misplaced a simple pass. Worse was to come as Johnson surged onto the ball, Kotarski bolting from his line; a race he was never going to win. Johnson touched around him and finished from a tight angle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They arrived in London with a single point from their previous three Champions League ties. In short, all is not well with them. Their threat was minimal and there was too much looseness. They struggled sorely to build up against the Spurs press.Simons sniffed out spaces from the No 10 role; his turns were sharp, he probed with menace. He created two huge chances for Kolo Muani towards the end of the first half, which the on-loan Paris Saint-Germain striker fluffed. First, after Simons had worked a slick give-and-go with Odobert, Kolo Muani dragged wide from close range. And then, following a perfect Simons cross, he headed over when unmarked from six yards.Copenhagen had issues all over the pitch but they began in goal and Spurs’s second also had Kotarski’s prints on it. He looked odds on to get out to a long ball only he was so slow, offering Kolo Muani hope. The Spurs player kept running and he was able to make the block, the ball spinning high towards the empty neat. Whereupon Kolo Muani brought it down with a sumptuous touch before teeing up Odobert.The red card for Johnson never threatened to derail Spurs. If anything, they were more menacing with 10 men, counterattacking in waves, Copenhagen completely losing their way. Johnson’s challenge looked worse on the relays but he did catch López down the achilles with his studs. It led to Frank withdrawing Simons, who could not suppress his unhappiness. The scene was set for Van de Ven.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueTottenham HotspurFC CopenhagenEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We need to assert ourselves and play better. We faced a well organised team, especially physically. We couldn’t get our game going,” the PSG captain, Marquinhos, said.PSG, who had beaten Bayern 2-0 in the Club World Cup quarter-finals in July, came out flying with their trademark high pressing but were caught cold in the fourth minute when Díaz smashed home after Lucas Chevalier had parried Michael Olise’s effort.Dembélé thought he had levelled midway through the half only for his goal to be ruled out for offside, as PSG pressed but looked unusually fragile at the back.Bayern stayed a step ahead and, after Serge Gnabry struck the post, Díaz pounced on a sleepy Marquinhos to steal the ball and slot home a second in the 32nd minute.View image in fullscreenLuis Díaz scores his and Bayern’s second after picking Marquinhos’s pocket.Photograph: Matthieu Mirville/DPPI/ShutterstockDíaz’s evening ended abruptly just before half-time when he was shown a straight red for a brutal lunge on Hakimi, who limped off in tears with a suspected ankle injury.Neves reduced the arrears with a scissor kick and came close to levelling a few minutes later with a header.Juventusare still without a win in the competition after they were held to a 1-1 draw in Turin bySporting, when Maximiliano Araújo put the visitors ahead and Dusan Vlahovic equalised for the hosts.An eight-game winless run in all competitions led to the recent sacking of the Juventus coach Igor Tudor and, after two victories on the bounce since then, another draw in Europe, this time under Luciano Spalletti, put the Italian side on three points from four matches.Sporting, who move on to seven points, went in front in the 12th minute when Francisco Trincão played the ball wide to Araújo who drilled a low shot off the far upright and into the bottom corner.Vlahovic’s glancing header from the edge of the six-yard box was saved by Rui Silva. The Serbian had another effort parried away for a corner, and was rewarded in the 34th minute when he toe-poked Khephren Thuram’s pin-point pass to the net.In Athens, Ricardo Pepi scored in stoppage time forPSV Eindhovento secure a 1-1 draw withOlympiakosand deny the Greek club a first win in the Champions League this season.

Keir Starmer called it the “wrong” decision and the opposition leader, Kemi Badenoch, said it was a “national disgrace”.On the streets of Aston, and close to the Villa stadium, lamp-posts are covered with Palestinian flags and some local businesses display posters of a rally scheduled on Thursday in support of Palestine and calling for Israel to be suspended from Uefa and Fifa.Abul Lase, who owns an accountancy firm in Aston, said someone had approached him to ask whether they could display the poster in his window. He agreed, although he has no plans to attend the protest.“There’s a lot of anxiousness around here,” Lase, 50, said. “For me, I don’t want [the match] to happen. But local people don’t want it to happen – a lot of them because [of what is happening in] Palestine right now. You probably see a lot of Palestine flags here, so you see the feelings for it.”Afsar Miah, an Aston resident, said he was going to attend the pro-Palestine protest on Thursday, and that the match should not go ahead due to “social issues”.Miah, like Lase, said the Maccabi fans had caused “trouble” in other countries. “In Holland, they played. These sort of fans, they’re causing problems.”According to West Midlands police, the fixture on Thursday was classified as “high risk” based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including “violent clashes and hate crime offences” that occurred aroundthe 2024 Europa League matchbetween Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam.View image in fullscreenAbul Lase has put up a poster for the pro-Palestine rally in the window of his accountancy firm but does not intend to attend himself.Photograph: John Robertson/The GuardianYehuda Fink, the managing director of Stand With Us UK – which describes itself as a “non-partisan Israel education organisation” – said the decision to ban Maccabi fans was “shocking and disappointing”.A petition to overturn the ban, set up by Stand With Us UK, now has more than 17,000 signatures. Fink said: “We had I think within 72 hours over 10,000 people support the petition that the decision should be reversed, and a full explanation as to why that decision was made should be revealed.”Jack Angelides, the chief executive of Maccabi Tel Aviv, described the ban as “unfair” and told the BBC in October the team had travelled to places such as Turkey where the sentiment is “not so kind towards Israeli teams”, but the police “were out in force” and there were no incidents.Shah Zaman, a 76-year-old Birmingham resident who was not previously aware of the ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, said the decision by local authorities was wrong. “Everybody [has the] right to enjoy the game, whatever country is playing,” he said.View image in fullscreenShah Zaman said the decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans was wrong: ‘Everybody [has the] right to enjoy the game, whatever country is playing.’Photograph: John Robertson/The GuardianLarissa Shaw, a 30-year-old Aston resident, said she was aware there was going to be a heightened police presence around the stadium on Thursday but that “there always is when there’s anAston Villamatch on”.She believes the situation around the stadium may be “worse this time” owing to the ban on the fans. “I’ve heard a few people say: ‘It’s going to be bad, there’s going to be a lot of police.’”West Midlands police declined to provide further comment.In a statement on Monday the Birmingham police commander, Ch Supt Tom Joyce, said: “We are experienced at policing high-profile football matches and demonstrations, and for many weeks now, we have been working closely with different faith and local community groups to listen to their views and concerns.“Our goal throughout planning for this match is to ensure people can enjoy the football fixture while we continue to keep everyone in Birmingham safe, facilitate peaceful protest and maintain the King’s peace.”Explore more on these topicsAston VillaMaccabi Tel AvivEuropa LeagueEuropean club footballPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Deals under the spotlight, highlighted in a2023 investigation by the Guardian and international media partners, include the transfers of star players Eden ­Hazard, Willian and Samuel Eto’o.On Tuesday, Fordstam Limited, the corporate vehicle that housedChelseaFC during Abramovich’s tenure, revealed that it does not expect to receive £150m of the proceeds from the sale of the club.It said this was owing to a “holdback amount”, a clause inserted into the takeover deal by BlueCo 22, the subsidiary through which Clearlake bought the club.As a result of the clause, a portion of the total payment is withheld for five years, to cover the cost of “any proceeding in relation to events which took place before the acquisition date, up to a value of £150m”, accounts for 2022 show. The figure is higher than the £100m buffer that had previously been reported.View image in fullscreenTodd Boehly led the consortium that took ownership of Chelsea in 2022.Photograph: Rafal Oleksiewicz/PAFordstam’s accounts reveal for the first time that it has written off the prospect of receiving the sum from Chelsea’s new owners, owing to “doubts about its recoverability”.Sources close to Chelsea said such a clause was not unusual in buyouts of companies and that it also covered costs such as lost revenues during a period when sanctions against Abramovich meant Chelsea could not sell tickets or merchandise.But football finance experts said Fordstam’s admission that it does not expect to receive the holdback amount could indicate that a sporting sanction on Chelsea – such as a points deduction or suspension from competition – is more likely than previously thought.“There’s a question mark there as to why the size of the provision is so big,” said the football finance expert and lawyer Stefan Borson.“The holdback amount will not just indemnify any financial penalty from a fine. It may also cover claims for consequential losses from any sporting sanctions, such as a loss of a European place or [Premier League] merit payments.”Borson added that the scale of the holdback amount meant that Chelsea and Clearlake would feel limited impact from a fine.“There’s no penalty for the football club at all if the sanctions are purely financial and all are effectively recovered from the sale proceeds to Fordstam,” he said.Kieran Maguire, an associate professor in football finance at the University of Liverpool and the co-host ofThe Price of Football podcast, said: “It [any fine] has effectively been taken into consideration in the offer price for the club.“The club will physically have to pay the penalty, so there would be a financial consequence, but the owners can in theory put an extra £150m into the club and be no worse off than if they’d paid the full agreed sum of £2.5bn.”Chelsea FC has previously raised funds byselling its women’s team to BlueCo 22.The club has indicated that it expects to receive a financial penalty from the FA, if found to have breached the rules. Spokespeople for Chelsea have highlighted the fact that it self-reported some transactions to the FA, Premier League and Uefa, after analysing Abramovich-era data.If Chelsea are guilty over Abramovich payments a fine would make a mockery of the rules | Rob DaviesRead moreFordstam’s results, filed at Companies House, also reveal the huge fees banked by executives and lawyers involved in the sale.Eugene Tenenbaum, a longtime associate of Abramovich, received a £4.8m bonus from Chelsea FC for his role in the takeover, the accounts show. BlueCo 22 covered the cost of £41.6m in legal fees incurred by Fordstam, according to the documents.The accounts also confirm that the £2.35bn proceeds of the deal are still frozen in a bank account, three years after Abramovich pledged to donate the sums to people affected by the conflict in Ukraine.The UK has said it isprepared to sue Abramovichto release the money. Fordstam’s accounts state that discussions with the Treasury “continue … in this regard”.In theory, the sum could be reduced by £1.5bn, the value of an interest-free loan that Fordstam owes to Camberley International Investments, an offshore financing entity that was used by Abramovich tochannel funds from multibillion pound oil deals into Chelsea.However, repayment of the loan could only be approved by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, a division of the Treasury. The oligarch has also pledged to write off the loan.The Guardian has approachedRoman Abramovichand Chelsea FC for comment.Explore more on these topicsChelseaRoman AbramovichnewsShareReuse this content"

Haaland was asked if he views himself on the same level. “No, not at all, far off. No one can get close to them, so no,” the 25-year-old said.This season Haaland has already scored 26 times in 16 appearances in all competitions, registering 13 Premier League strikes, four in the Champions League, and nine for Norway. City could play a maximum of 52 more games this term, while Norway could have 12 more matches if they reach the World Cup final plus a yet to be decided number of friendlies.Raw milk, tomahawk steak and a cuddly toy: could I handle Erling Haaland’s daily routine?Read moreAsked if he can beat his best tally of 2022-23, Haaland said: “Yeah I had 56 in total with the national team, so I’m on a good way. I don’t think of this.”Alan Shearer, whose 260 Premier League goals is the competition high, believes Haaland will break his record. The centre-forward said: “I don’t really know any records, but this one I know. I can’t think about records I can break – I try to help the team win football games. I know it’s boring, I know you want me to say the complete opposite, but it’s not how it is.”Haaland’s two goals against Bournemouth came from breaks in which he kept onside. The striker joked regarding how many times he has not done so since joining City in summer 2022. “I’m never offside – come on,” he said. “From when I came to City I’ve been offside 18 times. So 18 times in three and a half years is OK.“I hate to be offside. If you are offside now with VAR, there’s no chance [of not being caught]. VAR helped me even more because you get the decision as simple as that. When you barely go offside, there’s a good chance that if there’s an offside situation, most likely I will not be offside.”In the summer Guardiola selected Haaland to be in City’s leadership group, the Catalan pointing to his humble nature as a reason why. Haaland said: “For me it’s completely normal – I’m a Norwegian guy, and I should not think I am something just because I’m scoring goals, it’s as simple as that. I’m just Erling, and this is something that will never change.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The head coach insisted there remains plenty of opportunity to turn the league campaign around.“It was impressive because we played against an incredible side that is in an unbelievable run of form,” Slot said. “So to beat them is very positive but we can say we beat them because of a set piece.

Over the course of 10 wins and three defeats in that timeframe, Fox has been a dynamic force difficult to dislodge from the right flank of a new project. Her speed and skill are essential to the team’s defence and intrinsic to their attack.Looking back on 2025 with the US Women’s National Team, Fox says she would define the year as “part of the process”. The 27-year-old says: “I feel like every camp there is a huge learning that we’re taking out of it, whether that’s on the field or even culturally off the field. I think Emma and her staff are really good at that. So even though we didn’t have a major tournament this year, it still felt like there was a lot of growth, a lot of change, a lot of new people getting chances and opportunities.”Whereas in 2024 Hayes took hold of a programme two months before winning the gold medal, 2025 has allowed the former Chelsea manager more time to work on the team’s identity and refine tactics. According to Fox, Hayes has focused on the way they adapt. “I think really just being tactically flexible and aware and understanding that with a lot of opponents, they come out one way against one team, and then when they play us they play differently. And having that tactical ability to recognise that on the field, and then being able to talk to your teammates and collectively, as well as individually, make those changes on the fly.”More experienced players such as Fox have provided an essential spine of continuity to a team evolving around them. Thanks to injuries, retirements and myriad other causes, Fox was one of only a handful of players who started the gold-medal match in Paris and the first friendly of this past window. For Fox, it’s important to focus on the team’s principles as they adjust. But the impact of evolving the team with the younger generation is exciting: “With the game and with our national team there’s just this buzz of excitement. And I feel like with younger players, they want to see their opportunities. They want to make the most of it. They want to have fun. They want to enjoy it. I think there’s definitely this level of confidence and creativity that they all want to show, which is really exciting.”View image in fullscreenEmily Fox says the US were reminded of the importance of ‘getting our tackles in, bumping, blocking, being aggressive’.Photograph: Lev Radin/ShutterstockIn 2025, the USWNT lost three times in calendar year for the fifth time. They were beatenby Portugalfor the first time on 23 October but reading too much into that, as well as defeats against Japan and Brazil, would be unwise. They have come in a transitional year when Hayes has prioritised integrating new personnel and experimenting. The overarching importance of this year will be the lessons it provides for 2026.A few days after losing to Portugal in Pennsylvania, the USWNT adjusted their tactics and lineup and beat the same opponents 3-1. Fox says of Portugal’s first showing: “I thought they had a lot of patience and that they trusted their gameplan, and they executed it in turn.” Echoing Hayes, Fox said the 113 days between their previous friendly and that loss to Portugal had them looking a bit rusty, which was a learning for the team as well.View image in fullscreenEmily Fox (right) says winning the Champions League with Arsenal ‘added a whole other depth to me’.Photograph: Zed Jameson/PA“I think with us having not seen each other in like four or five months, and then with Portugal being our first game, I think it was a really good lesson also in the sense of how aggressive and physical we need to be, and really non-tactical stuff like getting our tackles in, bumping, blocking, being aggressive. Because I also think with Portugal, they’re very savvy in the way that they foul and the way that they play the game within the game.”Fox moved to London nearly two years ago to grow her game and experience it across the pond. The Virginia native has frequently emphasised the appeal of playing in the Champions League as inspiration for her move and last May shewon it with Arsenal. Fox says the experience expanded her perception of the things she was capable of: “​​I feel like it added a whole other depth to me. Last year we had to do all the qualifying rounds going into the Champions League to even be a part of it. And so that started right on the Olympics, and it was so challenging. I mean, the whole Champions League was so challenging. I think at the end of the Champions League, and even through it, I was like: ‘Look, I’ve been through this. I can get through this.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was 75.The federal government’s investigation into a company Conte founded, the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (Balco), yielded the convictions of Jones, the elite sprint cyclist Tammy Thomas and the formerNFLdefensive lineman Dana Stubblefield, along with coaches, distributors, a trainer, a chemist and a lawyer.Conte, who served four months in federal prison for dealing steroids, talked openly about his former clients. He went on television to say he had seen the three-time Olympic medallist Jones inject herself with human growth hormones, but always stopped short of implicating Bonds, the San Francisco Giants slugger.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The investigation led to the book Game of Shadows. A week after the book was published in 2006, Major League Baseball’s commissioner, Bud Selig, hired the former senate majority leader George Mitchell to investigate steroids.Conte said he sold steroids known as “the cream” and “the clear” and advised on their use to dozens of elite athletes, including Giambi, a five-time major league All-Star, the Mitchell report said.“The illegal use of performance-enhancing substances poses a serious threat to the integrity of the game,” the Mitchell report concluded. “Widespread use by players of such substances unfairly disadvantages the honest athletes who refuse to use them and raises questions about the validity of baseball records.”Mitchell said the problems did not develop overnight. He said everyone involved in baseball in the prior two decades – including commissioners, club officials, the players’ association and players – shared some responsibility for what he called “the steroids era”.View image in fullscreenThe San Francisco Giants’ Barry Bonds hits his 700th career home run off the San Diego Padres pitcher Jake Peavy in September 2004.Photograph: Jeff Chiu/APThe federal investigation into Balco began with a tax agent digging through the company’s trash. Conte wound up pleading guilty to two of the 42 charges against him in 2005 before a trial. Six of the 11 convicted people were ensnared for lying to grand jurors, federal investigators or the court.Bonds’ personal trainer Greg Anderson pleaded guilty to steroid distribution charges stemming from his Balco connections. Anderson was sentenced to three months in prison and three months of home confinement.Bonds was charged with lying to a grand jury about receiving performance-enhancing drugs and went on trial in 2011. Prosecutors dropped the case four years later when the government decided not to appeal to the supreme court against an overturned obstruction of justice conviction.A seven-time National League MVP and 14-time All-Star outfielder, Bonds ended his career after the 2007 season with 762 homers, surpassing the record of 755 that Hank Aaron set from 1954-76. Bonds denied knowingly using performance-enhancing drugs but has never been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.Bonds did not respond to an email seeking comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Snac System, the company that announced Conte’s death, did not respond to a message sent through the company’s website.After serving his sentence in a minimum security prison he described as “like a men’s retreat,” Conte got back in business in 2007 by resuscitating a nutritional supplements business he had launched two decades earlier called Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning (Snac) System.

He maintained he simply helped “level the playing field” in a world already rife with cheaters.To Dr Gary Wadler, a then-member of the World Anti-Doping Agency, Conte may as well have been pushing cocaine or heroin. “You are talking about totally illegal drug trafficking. You are talking about using drugs in violation of federal law,” Wadler said in 2007. “This is not philanthropy and this is not some do-gooding.

Born in Thornhill, Ontario just north of Toronto, Wiggins was known internationally by the time he was 13. It wasn’t always easy for the shy, small-town kid to embrace the spotlight.After just one full season at Vaughan, Wiggins needed better competition than Canada could provide and moved on to Huntington Prep in Huntington, West Virginia — a relatively new prep school set in a small, blue-collar, sports-oriented college town near Kansas.The head coach, Rob Fulford, had been recruiting Wiggins since he was 13, at one point watching 24 consecutive CIA Bounce games in person. “We developed a relationship with him,” Fulford said. “We recruited him harder than anyone else.”What stood out to Fulford was the same quality that would later get the young Wiggins in trouble, which was that everything he did looked so effortless. “He could just dominate a game from a talent perspective,” Fulford says. “It just was a clear difference between Andrew and everyone else.”But there was nothing quiet about the show Wiggins was putting on the basketball court, as Huntington quickly became the most popular high school team in the country, going from having 50 fans at a regular home game prior to his arrival to packed gyms with over 1,000 fans there to see the Canadian high school phenom with their own eyes. “A lot of people just wanted to see him play,” Rathan-Mayes says. “We tried to go and put on a show the best that we could every single night.”7ft 4in (at least) of menace: the Victor Wembanyama Era is already here | Lee EscobedoRead moreBut being at the centre of the basketball universe didn’t come naturally to the quiet kid from Vaughan. After all, shyness, like athleticism, runs in the Wiggins family: Wiggins’s father, Mitchell Sr, said the reason it didn’t work at his first college, Clemson, was that “I was so quiet, you couldn’t get a whisper out of me.” While a track teammate of his mother, Marita, said, “She was very quiet, still is very quiet and very unassuming.”Unlike LeBron James, who was happy to engage with the media and put on a show for the crowd since being crowned “The Chosen One” as a teenager, Wiggins was soft-spoken and shy, preferring to pass the attention on to his teammates instead of beating his chest after a big dunk. Many people wanted Wiggins to be the version of an alpha athlete that they were used to seeing on TV, like James and Kobe Bryant. And that dissonance created a tension with the basketball media and certain segments of the fan base, who wanted more from Wiggins.“I think we all have a certain kind of perception of what we want a great athlete to look like,” his junior national team coach, Roy Rana, says. “We want them to be fiery. We want them to be emotional. We want them to be extroverted. We want them to be demonstrative. That’s not Andrew.”The criticism picked up during Wiggins’s second and final season at Huntington Prep when, in February of 2013, a Sports Illustrated article questioned his work ethic, suggesting that he only showed up in big games while lofting through less important ones. “Andrew Wiggins’ work ethic and motor have yet to catch up to his athleticism and raw ability,” it read, bringing up examples of previous Canadian prospects whose careers stagnated as a result of poor decision-making or a lack of skill development. And it questioned the role models in his life, including his father, who was pushed out of theNBAfor cocaine use decades earlier.The day after the article came out, Wiggins dropped a career-high 57 points in a statement win. “I think it pissed him off,” Fulford says. “He wanted to prove a point.”“Just responding in a positive way,” Wiggins says. “Not saying anything, not … going on Twitter and saying anything … whenever you think you got something to say, just go on the court and do my thing.”Wiggins compiled one of the most memorable campaigns in high school basketball history that season, averaging 23 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, and three blocks per game and winning the Naismith Prep Player of the Year and the Gatorade National Player of the Year awards, earning a trip to the McDonald’s All-American Game. After that, he left to go to the University of Kansas.But the spotlight didn’t stop there. In fact, when Wiggins arrived at Kansas City International Airport in June of 2013, he emerged from the gate to find 15 fans waiting for his autograph after his itinerary had been posted on an online message board. When classes started, students began Twitter-stalking him, tweeting pictures of the back of his head in class and posting his whereabouts when he was spotted at local stores. Meanwhile, back home in Canada, Wiggins picked up the nicknames “Maple Jordan” and “Air Canada,” and all of his Kansas games were broadcasted on the national TV network TSN.While all this might seem normal now, 2013 was the beginning of the social media era. And between the fans stalking him, the student sections taunting him at away games, and the rapidly expanding media landscape criticizing his every move, it was hard for Wiggins to feel comfortable. “We talk about it sometimes, but he doesn’t like talking about it. That’s how bad it stresses him out,” his wife, Mychal Johnson, said at the time. “Sometimes he doesn’t know what to do.”“It was a lot,” Wiggins says now. “It was a lot.”Wiggins just wanted to be a normal kid. He happened to love basketball and be really good at it, but he wanted an average life away from the spotlight, playing Call of Duty after games and announcing his college decision without any media present. In fact, his Twitter bio used to read “Just a average kid trying to make it.”But when he was asked about it during his freshman year at Kansas, Wiggins said, “I used to be an average kid, when I put that up. But that … was a while ago.”Some of the criticism directed towards Wiggins was warranted. Even Fulford acknowledged that he was no gym rat – that things came so naturally to Wiggins that he needed to fall in love with the process of improving if he was going to reach his ceiling. “I don’t think at any point ever that anyone had to go tell Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant to pick it up,” Fulford said.Wiggins quietly improved under head coach Bill Self at Kansas, averaging 17 points, six rebounds, two assists, one steal, and one block as a freshman for the No 2-ranked Jayhawks, who went 24-9 before losing in the second round of the NCAA tournament. He even set the Kansas freshman single-season scoring record with 597 points.Still, there were times that Self had to get on Wiggins to play harder or be more aggressive offensively, instituting a special rule at some practices that only Wiggins was allowed to shoot. “Andrew is the type of guy who could score 28, and you’d say, ‘Why didn’t he score more?’” Self said. “Critics want him to do more. I understand that because the game comes so easy to him, it’s so natural.”Some of that on-court reticence came from the way Wiggins was raised, learning the game from his brothers and dad, who carved out a 20-year pro career as a defensive role player. “His dad taught him how to play basketball the right way,” Reid-Knight says, noting that Mitchell Sr always harped on the importance of being selfless and making the right reads. “Playing within your game and not forcing an action.”After one season at Kansas, Wiggins declared for the 2014 NBA Draft and was selected first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers – a foregone conclusion since Wiggins was in 10th grade. What made the selection even more amazing was that his CIA Bounce teammate, Brampton native Anthony Bennett, went first overall to Cleveland the year prior, giving Canada back-to-back first overall picks for the first time ever.The 2014 NBA Draft also featured Canadians Tyler Ennis, Nik Stauskas, and Dwight Powell, giving Canada a record 12 NBA players. That year Canada overtook France as the second-most represented country in the league behind the United States – a record it has held ever since.However, the best player in the world, James, returned to his hometown Cleveland in free agency that same summer. And before playing a single game in the NBA, Wiggins and Bennett were both traded to the rebuilding Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Kevin Love, making Wiggins the cornerstone of a franchise that had not been to the playoffs in 10 years. “I just gave in to it and figured I’d be good wherever I go,” Wiggins said. “The whole thing has worked out. [Minnesota has] put me in a situation where I can grow a lot more than on the team that drafted me.”Wiggins got off to a slow start in his NBA career before breaking out against the team that snubbed him, dropping 27 points in his first game against James’s Cavaliers. He followed it up with a stretch of six straight 20-point games, eventually becoming the first Canadian to win the NBA Rookie of the Year award after averaging 17 points, five rebounds, and two assists a game in 2014–15.While he never turned into the NBA superstar that many people had him pegged to become when he was a teenager, Wiggins went on to have an incredible career, spending five and a half seasons in Minnesota before getting traded to the Golden State Warriors in 2020. In the Bay, Wiggins became the third Canadian NBA All-Star and won an NBA championship as the team’s second-leading scorer in the 2022 NBA Finals, when he averaged 18 points and nine rebounds.But, for better or worse, the huge spotlight and unbalanced criticism that started to shine on Wiggins when he was a teenage phenom never left him, especially in Canada – a basketball-crazed nation that was growing hungry for a superstar.As Wiggins once said, “I know I can never live up to expectations.”This is an edited extract from The Golden Generation: How Canada Became aBasketballPowerhouse by Oren Weisfeld.

The coach, Jonathan Gannon, barely had an answer at all. The Cardinals will worry about what appears to be a full-blown controversy later. For now, they will enjoy ending a five-game losing streak.Brissett threw for two touchdowns and ran for a score in another game with Murray sidelined by a foot injury, and the Cardinals beat theDallas Cowboys27-17 on Monday night. Brissett made his third consecutive start after the week began with expectations of Murray returning coming off the team’s open week.The Chiefs-Bills rivalry is incapable of producing a bad gameRead moreInstead, the Cardinals pivoted to Brissett, with Gannon saying Murray wasn’t quite ready. Arizona (3-5) won for just the second time in the past 18 games in which Murray didn’t take at least five snaps or sat out entirely. “Nothing’s changed,” Gannon said both times he was asked if Brissett had done enough to become the starter.The Cowboys (3-5-1) couldn’t build on the momentum of Sam Williams’ blocked punt that was recovered in the end zone by Marshawn Kneeland, giving up long touchdown drives on Arizona’s next two possessions on either side of half-time to fall behind 24-7. Marvin Harrison had a career-high seven catches for 96 yards, including a four-yarder for the game’s first touchdown. Tight end Trey McBride had a 12-yard TD grab.After their punt block and recovery for a score, the Cowboys gave up an average of 10.8 yards on the next 15 Arizona plays, including consecutive 16-yard passes right after the Dallas TD and Michael Wilson’s 50-yard catch and run on the second play after half-time.The Cowboys easily reached the Arizona 7 with a first down on the game’s first possession, but came away with nothing when Dak Prescott was sacked on fourth down by Josh Sweat, who had two of the five sacks on the Dallas quarterback. Calais Campbell also had two in his 250th career regular-season game.Dallas, who lost consecutive games for the first time under their first-year coach, Brian Schottenheimer, totalled just three points on its first three drives inside the Arizona 25, leading to the 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter. The Cowboys could have closed to within 14 with a field goal on the first play of the fourth quarter, but Prescott threw incomplete to CeeDee Lamb on fourth-and-3. Dallas were 0 for 3 on fourth down.View image in fullscreenArizona Cardinals quarterback Jacoby Brissett throws a pass in the first half.Photograph: Julio Cortez/AP“We were going to be aggressive all game,” Schottenheimer said. “That was part of the deal. If I like the call, I’m going to go. I trust our offense. But we didn’t make the plays tonight.”The Cardinals lost Brissett’s first two starts, but not because the 32-year-old veteran was ineffective. He was solid again, going 21 of 31 for 261 yards without an interception, giving him 860 yards, six touchdowns and one pick in three games without Murray.Murray – the No 1 overall pick in 2019 – is 9-0 at AT&T Stadium, with state championships as a high school quarterback, two Big 12 titles with Oklahoma and a pair of victories over the Cowboys. Well, Brissett is now 1-0 as a starter against Dallas.“I don’t get into that stuff, man,” Brissett said when asked if he had done enough to replace Murray. “I’m just trying to go out here and win games and be a good teammate. And do the best I can when I get my opportunities. That’s all I can ask for.”Commanders coach accepts blame for leaving Jayden Daniels in game before serious injuryRead moreThe last hope for the Cowboys ended with their second lost fumble. Javonte Williams had the ball ripped out as he was going down on a short catch with less than five minutes to go. Prescott had just one touchdown pass a week after having none as one of the league’s best offenses was sluggish again. The scoring toss was a 5-yarder in the fourth quarter for Ryan Flournoy’s first career TD.“We’ve got to figure out how we need to improve in all phases of the game,” said Prescott, who was 24 of 39 for 250 yards with a late interception on a desperation fourth-and-28 throw. “Special teams did a hell of a job getting us a touchdown, and that was the only spark I think in the game, especially in the first half.”The Cardinals started the season 2-0 before losing five in a row by a total of 13 points. Gannon’s first win as a head coach was against the Cowboys two years ago – part of a 1-8 start.“I’m looking at my watch, and I don’t remember the last time we won,” Gannon said. “It falls on me. At the bye, I was sitting in the shower, thinking about, ‘How did I let this happen?’ Everybody in there takes that attitude.”Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsDallas CowboysArizona CardinalsShareReuse this content"

Instead, it was a subpoena. He had been sued in federal court for illegally downloading 80 movies. Some of the titles sounded cryptic – Do Not Worry, We Are Only Friends – or banal, like International Relations Part 2. Others were less subtle: He Loved My Big Ass, He Loved My Big Butt, and My Big Booty Loves Anal.Brown, who had spent decades investigating sex crimes, claimed he had never watched any of them. His years “dealing with pimping”, he wrote in a court filing, left him “with no interest in pornography”. He had been married for 40 years, he did not need to download Hot Wife, another title in the list. But the subpoena did not seem like something he could laugh off. It said he could face damages of up to $150,000 per movie – as much as $12m for all 80 films. If he did not respond promptly, the letter said, Comcast would identify him to the plaintiff in the case: a company called Strike 3 Holdings.‘I didn’t start out wanting to see kids’: are porn algorithms feeding a generation of paedophiles – or creating one?Read moreStrike 3 is not a name that Brown, or most people outside the world of copyright law, would recognize. The Delaware-based corporation, formed in 2015, owns the intellectual property rights to a catalog of about 2,000 adult films, mostly made by Vixen Media Group, its porn production subsidiary. It had very little online footprint; no social presence to speak of. But its associates were better known. The company was co-founded by Greg Lansky, the French porn director whose recent pivot to the art world has yielded works such as Algorithmic Beauty,amarble reproductionof the Venus de Milo with breast implants taking a selfie.Lansky, a 42-year-old Parisian, was something of a celebrity in the adult industry, having formed Vixen, the production company behind some of the porn world’s most popular brands: Vixen, Slayed, Wifey, Milf-y, Tushy, Tushy Raw, Blacked, Blacked Raw. The studio’s commitment to high-production value had attracted dozens of awards in adult media and write-ups from outlets outside it.

His free videos regularly ranked among the most-viewed scenes on PornHub, pushing viewers towards a paid tier. And his websites, Lansky has said, follow the “same business model as HBO”: premium subscription services, charging between $9.95 and $29.95 a month.What Lansky left out was that, since September 2017, Vixen’s owners had been pursuing another revenue stream: filing thousands of boilerplate copyright lawsuits against individual “John Does” and collecting millions in settlement fees – a mass litigation campaign one federal judge likened to “a hi-tech shakedown”.Brown, who was sued in November of 2017,numbered among Strike 3’s earliest targets. But in the eight years since, Strike 3 has become the most prolific copyright plaintiff in the country – filing, bythe Guardian’s analysis of Pacer data, more than 20,000 federal copyright cases since September 2017.[Strike 3] treats this Court not as a citadel of justice, but as an ATMJudge Royce C LamberthMore recently, Strike 3 has been in the news for a higher profile case: a $350m copyright lawsuit against Facebook’s parent company Meta. Meta is a rare corporate defendant; the overwhelming majority of Strike 3’s suits are aimed at anonymous users across the country. Lansky, who sold his stake in Vixen Media in 2020, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, nor did a representative for Vixen Media Group. A spokesperson for Strike 3 declined to answer specific questions about its legal strategy, but provided a statement to the Guardian: “Strike 3 is a legitimate film studio, that has created award-winning content, distributed through paid subscription platforms,” she wrote, “and has resorted to litigation only when necessary to protect the livelihood [sic] and its paying subscribers from widespread piracy.”Some judges are furious at just how many cases Strike 3 are filing. Armed with “hundreds of cut-and-pasted complaints and boilerplate discovery motions, Strike 3 floods this courthouse (and others around the country) with lawsuits smacking of extortion”, district judge Royce C Lamberth wrote. “It treats this Court not as a citadel of justice, but as an ATM.”The sheer number of lawsuits has spawned a cottage industry of defense attorneys looking to take on the John Does’ cases. “I see new ones popping up all the time,” said attorney Steve Vondran, who is something of an influencer in this community, having defended more than 500 Strike 3 cases. He answers questions on YouTube and LinkedIn like: “Am I going to lose my house?” or “Will I have to file for bankruptcy?”Thousands of lawsuits follow a similar formula: Strike 3 claims to use a proprietary software called VXN Scan to track IP addresses that have downloaded porn they own. The software cannot identify the user beyond a rough geographic location, so Strike 3 files suit against an anonymous John Doe, and subpoenas their internet service provider (ISP) to unmask the user. The ISP in turn alerts the subscriber – which is when most people find out they have been sued.These people are often keen to settle, being cheaper than litigation and the only way to ensure their anonymity.That was certainly the case for Ken Jones*, a 28-year-old mental health worker, who received his own subpoena earlier this year. (Jones was the only defendant out of the dozen the Guardian contacted who was willing to discuss his case on the record, and he agreed to do so only on the condition of anonymity and without specifics to his settlement agreement.) “I remember being terrified. I had no idea what to do,” he said. “My mind kept going to the worst case scenario: life savings gone because of a few downloads. It felt unreal. I was unable to eat or sleep for some time.”Though he maintained to the Guardian he had never seen any of their films, Jones decided to settle because “it was the quickest way to leave this in the past”, he said.The “shame and taboo” made “the decision to fight the allegations a bit more challenging”.As Strike 3 tells it, these lawsuits are merely a defense against piracy. Its films, the company claims, “are among the most pirated content in the world” (though they did not provide data to support that claim).Critics see Strike 3 differently –the country’s leading “copyright troll”, or a rightsholder who treats litigation as a business model, rather than a means of protecting their work. Strike 3 does not disclose how much it makes from lawsuits, but several defense attorneys who spoke to the Guardian estimated that the company makes millions each year. Though copyright law allows for statutory damages of up to $150,000 per film, in reality, most defendants pay about $750 per title, according to Vondran. But for several dozen titles, that can quickly become settlements that range between $20,000 and $30,000.“They want usually, minimum, what I call ‘five-figure settlements’: $10,000 or more,” Vondran said. “It’s why I think they wait to get at least 24 movies before they sue you, because that takes them right into that zone.” Even if only half of their cases settle in a given year, Strike 3 could collect between $20m and $30m in fees.The rise of the‘copyright trolls’Copyright trolls, a category which many have argued includes Strike 3, have skirted much notice outside legal circles, in part because they are seen as a relic of a bygone era.The copyright troll emerged from the 2000s internet, when the proliferation of peer-to-peer sharing tools first gave the public unprecedented access to almost any copyrighted work – be it My Little Pony Crystal Princess: The Runaway Rainbow(2006) orbootleg footage of the heavy metal Fuck Christ Tour ‘93.Between 2003 and 2008, the Recording Industry Association of America responded by filing more than 35,000 lawsuits against music pirates. Their campaign focused more on deterrence rather than revenue, but they created a model others soon copied. By the new decade, the courts were inundated by a new kind of mass copyright litigation – what law professor and part-time trolling historian Matthew Sag called, the “BitTorrent era”, after the sharing protocol popularized by sites like the Pirate Bay.View image in fullscreenThe homepage of the Pirate Bay, the popular filesharing website.Photograph: FocusDigital/AlamyThese suits were perfectly legal; any copyright owner is entitled to sue for infringement. But between 2011 and 2014, several entities emerged as what Aaron Moss,author of the Copyright Lately newsletter, calls “frequent flyers”– plaintiffs who seemed more interested in a “sue and settle” approach, rather than earnestly deterring pirates. Theserepeat litigants tended to come from struggling industries such as newspaper and independent movies (Voltage Pictures, the production company behind The Hurt Locker and later, Dallas Buyers Club,is notoriously aggressive for pursuing lawsuits against individual John Does).But the vast majority came from porn companies – so many that the subset earned its own name: “porno-trolling”.[Most] reluctantly pay rather than have their names associated with illegally downloading porn ... For these individuals, resistance is futileJudge Otis WrightPorno-trolls had “discovered the nexus of antiquated copyright laws, paralyzing social stigma, and unaffordable defense costs”, Judge Otis Wright wrote in the opinion that coined the term. “They exploit this anomaly by accusing individuals of illegally downloading a single pornographic video. Then they offer to settle – for a sum calculated to be just below the cost of a bare-bones defense.” Most “reluctantly pay rather than have their names associated with illegally downloading porn”, he went on. “For these individuals, resistance is futile.”Porn was itself a struggling industry; the proliferation of free streaming sites cut into producers’ profits. But the early porno-trolls seemed to stretch the bounds of what copyright law allowed. The bulk of these cases were represented by a firm called Prenda Law, many of whose clients, it turned out, did not exist.The firm, prosecutors later alleged, had ahabitof creating “sham” porn companies with fake executives and suing on their behalf. (One of the “officers” of their supposed clients was in fact, per theLos Angeles Times, “the unpaid caretaker of Steele’s cabin in rural Minnesota” who had been promoted to fake porn executive without his knowledge.) By 2016, partners at Prenda Law, John Steele and Paul Hansmeier, were arrested by federal authorities and charged on 18 counts of fraud, perjury, and money laundering. At times, the complaintalleged, Steele and Hansmeier went so far as to film low-budget porn themselves and upload it to torrent sites “in order to lure people to download the movies”. Steele was eventually sentenced tofiveyears in federal prison; Hansmeier to14.Not every porno-troll went to such overtly illegal lengths. If Prenda Law invented the model, Malibu Media professionalized it. The most prolific of the porn plaintiffs, Malibu Media was the legal arm of softcore website X-Art, run by the pornographer couple Colette Pelissier and Brigham Field. The couple’s prolific caseload attracted national press and aprofilein the New Yorker.(The headline read: The Biggest Filer of Copyright Lawsuits? This Erotica Website.) In 2014, the couple had filed a third of all US copyright litigation that year: 1,300 infringement cases.By the end of the Obama administration, however, it seemed that copyright trolling had peaked. BitTorrenting was on the wane, as streaming platforms took over popular entertainment. Many of the biggest players seemed to burn out: the Prenda partners went to jail, and Malibu imploded into infighting. (In late 2016, Malibu’s founders sued their own lawyer, Florida attorney Keith Lipscomb, for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty; the case was later dismissed). The era of copyright trolling appeared to be winding down. “Filesharing lawsuit numbers drop by more than half,” Ars Technicareportedthat year. Sag, the field’s most-cited scholar, moved on to other research. “My gut says that it has decreased in volume somewhat,” one IP attorney told me, “but that’s just my gut feeling.”But in reality, the field was merely changing shape. In 2017, a lawyer from the Lipscomb firm, which had led Malibu Media’s copyright campaign, found a new job as general counsel at Vixen Media Group. Strike 3 filed its first copyright claim three months later. These days, bulk copyright cases still account for the majority of federal copyright filings; the field of participants has merely become more concentrated. According to Westlaw and Pacer data from the past three years, Strike 3 accounted for 50% of the federal copyright docketall on its own.I first heard about Strike 3 in September, when some legal clerk friends mentioned that nearly every judge on their circuit was handling a stack of Strike 3 cases – which are now so consistent as to have become routine. One would be hard pressed to find a federal judge in America who has not encountered the porn company; in a 2022 article about intellectual property experience in the western district of Texas, for example, half of the justices explicitly cited Strike 3:Chief judge Orlando Garcia: “The chief judge’s docket features a hefty amount of trademark and copyright work, particularly from a litigious porn studio, Strike 3 Holdings.”Judge Fred Biery: “Judge Biery’s docket, like the chiefs, is full of copyright suits filed by Strike 3.:Judge Robert Pitman: “His docket is likewise filled with cases from Strike 3.”Judge Jason Pulliam: “Judge Pulliam … like several of his colleagues, has Strike 3 filing up a big portion of his intellectual property work.”Judge Xavier Rodriguez: “And like some of his peers, he has faced a series of copyright suits from Strike 3.”The vast majority of Strike 3’s cases are settled or voluntarily dismissed for undisclosed reasons. None of the lawyers I spoke to could name a single claim that had gone to trial, and according to Westlaw’s litigation analytics, no case ever has.Only 10 or so people have even tried – one of them was Brown, the retired cop. Shortly after receiving his subpoena, he countersued the company for negligent emotional distress. He hired the intellectual property lawyer J Curtis Edmondson, a recurring figure on the Strike 3 circuit. Of the maybe 10 cases that “have gone the distance”, as he puts it, to litigate Strike 3’s allegations, Edmondson has represented all but one.Edmondson’s interest in litigating Strike 3 cases stems from the fact that, despite the company’s broad success in bringing copyright infringement claims, there remain several open questions about its methods. For one, IP addresses are notoriously fickle; it is easy to spoof an IP address through a virtual private network (VPN) or to use someone else’s address via malware that bypasses passwords. More to the point, as Mitch Stoltz, IP litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, puts it: “In a lot of cases, many, many people are using the same IP address.” Any given address may be shared between roommates, colleagues or members of a family.The prevalence of shared IP addresses has yielded some high-profile misfires; in 2011, for example, a porn company called Hard Productions sued a grandma in her 70s for torrenting hours of hardcore. (The retired widow “doesn’t know what BitTorrent is”, SF Gatereported at the time, though she did live next to “a handful of young men”.) A few years later, the production company behind the 2014 Adam Sandler film The Cobbler sued an Oregon man for allegedly downloading the film multiple times. The defendant, it turned out, ran an adult foster care, and his internet was regularly accessed by his residents. The case, Cobbler Nevada v Gonzales, went up to the ninth circuit, which ruled that IP addresses alone were insufficient for identifying infringement. In order to state a claim, the justices wrote, the plaintiff had to allege “something more” – some additional evidence to establish “a reasonable inference that a subscriber is also an infringer”.Brown found himself in a similar situation. As it turned out, the retired cop had an adult son who lived at home, who had not held a job in 10 years and lived with a social anxiety so absolute it prevented him from “talking to strangers” or driving, during which he would “constantly worry about how other people on the road can run into me”. As a result, the son later wrote in a legal filing: “I rarely leave my house and spend most of the time in my own room.” As the case progressed, Strike 3 found their “something more” – namely, the son’s profile on a uTorrent forum, where he wrote things such as “utorrent is a keeper.” But in this case, that was neither here nor there; they had sued Brown, not his son. Strike 3 quickly dropped the claims, and in 2020, a judge sided with Brown on his countersuit, affirming that he had not infringed any copyright and awarding him $47,777.26 in attorney’s fees. It remains the biggest victory any John Doe has notched against Strike 3, and yet for many critics, somewhat bittersweet.The black box suing softwareFor Edmondson, the real question at the heart of Strike 3’s cases, and others like it, concerns the detection software used to identify those downloading Vixen’s porn videos. As part of a case, Strike 3 and its peers submit records that a given IP address is linked to specific downloads. But the software that produces those records is shrouded in mystery. “The corporate entities, people, software, and processes relied upon to prove infringement,” Sag wrote, “are somewhat shadowy and opaque.”And there are many reasons, Edmonson argues, to doubt their accuracy. When geolocation services cannot match an IP address with a specific location, as Vondran has noted, they may “randomly assign addresses to a general location”. In one prominent example from 2017, for example, Venice PI, the company that owns the copyrights to the Bruce Willis film Once Upon A Time in Venice, filed two suits against the same defendant: a 91-year-old man named Wilbur Miller who was not only deceased but had, as his widow attested, “suffered from dementia” for at least five years, rendering him “both mentally and physically incapable of operating a computer”.For a time, nearly every John Doe copyright case in the US claimed to use a suite of detection services based in Germany. These companies went by many names – Guardaley, IPP International, Maverickeye UG, Excipio Gmbh or Crystal Bay Corp – but they employed many of the same staff, filed many near-identical declarations in court cases, and seemed on the whole to be, per Sag, “essentially the same entity”. At the very least, they seemed to all be controlled by the same few people, though who those people were exactly was somewhat unclear. Crystal Bay Corp, for example, filed more than 500 declarations signed by an expert witness identified as “Darren M Griffin” – a man who, as Edmondson laterwrote, “is in fact a completely fictitious person”. (Griffin did, however, have two flesh-and-blood colleagues at Crystal Bay, who variously attested to work at Guardalay, IPP and Maverickeye.)We were all waiting to see ... What was their technology going to show?Steve Vondran, attorneyStrike 3 relied on these same services until 2018,when they debuted their own tracking software, VXN Scan. In legal filings, Strike 3 claims it functions much like a BitTorrent client – downloading pieces of a given work from peers within the torrent network, and tracing those pieces back to the IP addresses seeding them. But Edmondson and others argue that the new detection tool, like its German predecessors, is a “black box”. As Edmondson put it: “Nobody knows how it works.”Because none of Strike 3’s cases have ever gone to trial, the company has never had to disclose the source code, or submit the software to closer scrutiny. In 2023, the Strike 3 legal community watched as one Florida defendant, a defense contractor and another Edmonson client, got closer than anyone ever had. After three years of litigation, a jury trial had been scheduled that spring. “We were all waiting to see – what was going to be the outcome?” Vondran recalled. “What was their technology going to show?” They never found out; on the eve of trial, the parties reached a confidential settlement.Strike 3’s critics may now get another chance. The company’s lawsuit against Meta, first filed in July, takes its copyright litigation to new heights, and a much larger target.The case emerged amid a flood of copyright lawsuits against the AI firms that now dominate the US economy. Meta and its peers have argued their use of copyrighted material is “transformative”, meaning it changes the original work enough to amount to fair use. But in a lawsuit filed by a group of authors, Meta emails revealed the company had torrented as much as 81.7 terabytes of pirated books and academic papers from such sites as Anna’s Archive. (A district judge later ruled against the authors on procedural grounds, without determining if Meta’s use of copyrighted work was lawful).The case prompted Strike 3 to examine its archive of recorded infringement, where it claims to have identified 47 different IP addresses owned by Meta. Strike 3 alleges that, over the course of years, Meta torrented at least 2,396 of its films for training artificial intelligence – infringements which could, if proven, amount to $350m in damages.‘Would love to see her faked’: the dark world of sexual deepfakes – and the women fighting backRead moreThe tech company is fighting the case – filing a motion to dismiss last week that argued Strike 3 had failed to show that Meta “was aware of the downloads” or “directed this activity”. The motion instead pointed the finger at Strike 3’s more common target: “unidentified users” who downloaded porn for “private personal use”. In a statement to the Guardian, Strike 3’s spokesperson contested that characterization: “This case is not about isolated personal activity,” she wrote. “This complaint reflects coordinated, corporate-scale conduct and the unauthorized distribution of creative works across multiple networks and jurisdictions.”)For Strike 3 defense lawyers, the larger case presents a new opportunity to scrutinize the porn firm’s piracy detection practices because, according to the complaint, the company tracked Meta’s downloads the same way they had the Does’: VXN Scan. If the case proceeds to trial, it may finally let the public look inside Strike 3’s black box.Strike 3’s spokesperson indicated they are keen to fight the case. “If the Meta case represents anything, it is Strike 3’s belief in its company and confidence in its technology,” she wrote. “Meta will undoubtedly bring the most powerful legal team to bear, but that does not change the facts or the law.”For Edmondson, the concern is the precedent it sets in a world where digital records are easy to falsify. “I kind of look 10 years into the future when it will be ridiculously easy to fabricate information,” he said. As he sees it, the courts should “take a stand now, at the beginning of a case, as to whether the evidence is good evidence or not”, because in the future, “you could just create that all using AI.”*Using a pseudonym"

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery. If you like reading our newsletter, forward this email to five friends with a demand they sign up like it’s a chain letter warning of bad luck for five years. In this week’s news, AI companies hit mind-boggling financial milestones such as a $5tn valuation, a $100bn quarter, and a string of deals worth nearly $600bn.The AI boom’s incomprehensibly vast numbers make it hard to criticizeLast week, the chipmaker Nvidia hit a valuation of $5tn. Just three months prior, it became the world’s first $4tn company. Microsoft reached a $4tn valuation last week, as did Apple. On a smaller scale, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet all reported their quarterly earnings. The sums were vast. Google’s parent reaped its first $100bn quarter. Amazon reported stellar growth in its cloud computing unit and added 13% to its stock price. Meta faced an unexpected tax bill of $16bn. All of the tech giants, except Apple, revised their capital expenditure figures upward, declaring to their investors that they would spend billions more on the real-world infrastructure that underpins artificial intelligence. The revisions added tens of billions to a total that’s already in the hundreds of billions. Alphabet alone estimated its capital expenditure at between $91bn and $93bn for the upcoming year. That estimate is up from an original declaration of $75bn in February and a revised figure of $85bn announced in July.Not to be outdone by its publicly traded rivals, OpenAI,recently converted to a for-profit enterpriseand mulled an initial public offering at a valuation of $1tn. The world’s most valuable startup has been on a dealmaking spree, signing agreements with Nvidia, which committed to investing $100bn in OpenAI in September; Microsoft, which signed an agreement in early October for OpenAI to spend $250bn on Azure cloud services; and Oracle, another cloud computing giant that OpenAI agreed to spend on in September, this time $300bn. On Monday, the ChatGPT-maker announced a deal with Amazon Web Services for $38bn. In total, OpenAI has promised to spend $588bn in the coming years.Nvidia’s valuation is now larger than Germany’s entire annual economic output in 2025 ($4.66bn). Put another way, the market capitalization of Nvidia is two and a half times the market capitalization of every publicly traded company in Germany put together, roughly $2.04tn in 2024, per the World Bank. How can one company be worth more than the world’s third largest economy, a nation of 83.5 million people, a country whose economy forms the financial backstop of an entire continent?Read more:Boom or bubble? Inside the $3tn AI datacentre spending spree | Artificial intelligence (AI) | The GuardianThe difficulty in comprehending the financials of the AI boom makes it difficult to criticize with clarity or force. What could I say to an avalanche? Even the most insightful analysis seems like it will be bowled over and crushed beneath the weight of a billion-dollar datacenter. All of these numbers buck understanding. There is nothing in your individual human life that you could compare them with. How would I spend $91bn? How would I make hundreds of billions of choices? Thinking about them feels bizarre. Describing Meta’s earnings as “mixed” is strange, though they were, by Wall Street experts’ estimates.The circular, multibillion-dollar deals between the companies atop the boom have given rise to fears of overinflated value and financial fragility. Should one company falter, it seems the others might follow suit and bring the US economy down with them. So far, they show no signs of stopping their joint rampage.View image in fullscreenAn Nvidia Blackwell GPU is displayed at Computex in Taipei, Taiwan, last year.Photograph: Ann Wang/ReutersOn the more populist side of that criticism are reports that AI has yet to find an essential use case other than cheating on homework assignments. It can’t adequately replace workers, no matter how many of them a CEO might lay off. About 95% of AI pilots conducted in businesses to date have failed,MIT researchers foundin August.The financials of the AI boom are so enormous as to defy comprehension; its digital size is immense as well. Large language models such as ChatGPT, Claude Sonnet and others function in part via parameters, variables that define how the model makes predictions of what word should come next. These unseen knobs tweak the response number in the hundreds of billions, with some reports indicating GPT-5 might make use of a trillion of them.AI’s physical imprint on the world matches the magnitude of the technology’s financial scale. Dara Kerr, one of the Guardian’s technology reporters, visited the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, home to the largest data center in the US and several of its smaller siblings, on a reporting trip last week. Here she describes its unbelievable scale:The Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center stretches from Interstate 80 up into the dry Nevada desert mountains. The complex spans tens of thousands of acres and is home to nearly 200 companies, both for fulfillment and logistics operations and tech data centers. That includes Google, Microsoft and Tesla. Some businesses have several data centers, each multiple football fields long, that snake up the desert valleys. The industrial center’s landmass makes up 65% of the county’s territory. It’s so big, it’s almost hard to comprehend.Should you buy that gadget?How do Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 compare against hearing aids?

The Trump Media and Technology group will introduce its “Truth Predict” feature, which will allow users “to trade prediction contracts related to major events and milestones, such as political elections, interest and inflation rate changes, commodity prices on gold and crude oil, events across all major sports leagues, and more” using the new product, though when it will go live is unclear.Devin Nunes, TMTG’s head, said of the feature: “For too long, global elites have closely controlled these markets – with Truth Predict, we’re democratising information and empowering everyday Americans to harness the wisdom of the crowd, turning free speech into actionable foresight.” In classic Trumpian fashion, Nunes hypocritically gnashes his teeth at “global elites” from a perch high in the eyrie of US power.Something feels off about this arrangement, like if the boxer in the fight was also the bookie. Trump is the president of the United States and is asking his constituents to put money on the outcome of elections that he will be campaigning in. He is in control of the policies that can determine the rates users bet on. Though he’s heading towards his two-term limit in the presidency, he hasflirted with an unconstitutional third term. Would US citizens bet on whether he can make it happen?Even the creation of the Truth Predict feature feels like inside basketball (more on that sport in the next paragraph). Crypto.com has donated $11m to Trump’s causes, theFinancial Timespoints out. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has closed an investigation during Trump’s term, and the company has applied for a banking charter with the regulator. Trump Media and Technology group signed a deal to buy billions of dollars’ worth of Cronos, Crypto.com’s token.Gambling pervades US society more than ever. Trading on election outcomes was legalized just last year. Betting volumes on the prediction market Kalshi have reached $1bn per week, according to another Financial Times analysis. The infection began with sports betting, which has reached a fever pitch. My colleague Bryan Armen Graham describes the implications of scandal, dubbed Operation Nothing But Bet by FBI investigators, that rocked professional basketball in the week before Halloween, with an NBA player, a head coach and 30 others arrested:The NBA gambling scandal represents a culmination of the years-long embrace between professional leagues and the multibillion-dollar gambling industry that has now crossed the line from synergy into scandal. It’s the most significant corruption crisis to hit a major American league since betting was legalized in most US states, and the most revealing picture yet of how deeply gambling has fused itself into the bloodstream of professional sports.When will politics face its own version of Operation Nothing But Bet?The wider TechScapeNHS hospitals to test AI tool that helps diagnose and treat prostate cancerIn Grok we don’t trust: academics assess Elon Musk’s AI-powered encyclopediaUkrainian computer game-style drone attack system goes ‘viral’Character.AI bans users under 18 after being sued over child’s suicideRevealed: Israel demanded Google and Amazon use secret ‘wink’ to sidestep legal ordersExplore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterArtificial intelligence (AI)newslettersShareReuse this content"

A survey by Sky Mobile has revealed that getting a LOL in a message gives 26% of 18- to 28-year-olds the ick. Their second biggest gripe, in fact.What’s topof the icks?Sluggish replies. Related, and not far behind, is an impatient “??” if you don’t get an immediate reply to the first message. Though, interestingly, 79% admitted to ignoring messages.Almost like they hate themselves!Actually, 61% did admit to being embarrassed by their own texting habits.I’ll probably just stick to a simplethumbs upemoji, to be on the safe side 👍Again, that’s considered cringe, I’m afraid. Likewise, the see-no-evil monkey 🙈, an awkward grimace 😬, and the happy poo 💩.Ew! And the tears of joy emoji 😂, as aLOL substitute? I’m guessing that’s over too?Onlyused by oldies. Gen Zs (and below) are more likely to send a skull 💀, or a coffin ⚰️.Sodyingof, not crying with,laughter?Exactly.What about abbreviations, like “hru” and “wyd”?How am I? I’m fine. And I am probably not replying to that, that’s what I’m doing.Rly?Really. A study published in theJournal of Experimental Psychologyfound that while they might save the sender time, the receiver might see using abbreviations as a sign of insincerity. Annoying to young and old alike.God, it’s complicated isn’t it, trying to keep up?Tell me about it. There’sa video on ABC newsof school kids telling their teacher that “cringe” is out.“Cringe” is cringe!And “ick” probably gives them the ick.Does any of it matter? I’m hoping that people will be able to see beyond text speak and emojisto the actual person.Keep hoping. Going back to that Sky Mobile survey, 58% of these gen Zs confessed they have considered dumping their partner because of what they see as bad phone etiquette.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The new Watch SE 3 costs from £219 (€269/$249/A$399), making it one of the cheapest brand-new fully fledged smartwatches available for the iPhone and undercutting the £369Series 11and the top-of-the-line £749Apple Watch Ultra 3.The Watch SE line is updated only every few years and has been good value but was missingsome crucial thingsthat make Apple’s other watches great. The Watch SE 3’s biggest upgrade is an always-on display, which brings it up to par with the Series line, allowing you to see the time and notifications at a glance without having to twist your wrist to turn the screen on.View image in fullscreenThe screen on and active with the flow watch face (left) and in its idle always-on position (right) with the time still visible.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe SE 3 has the older Apple Watch design from 2020’sSeries 6with smaller screens, larger bezels and a choice of 40mm or 44mm case sizes compared with the current Series watches. The screen is also not quite as bright as the more expensive watches, but that is noticeable only in bright direct sunlight. It is still sharp and good looking.The SE 3 has the same S10 chip as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, and is just as responsive. It also has the same excellent touch-free gestures, including double tap and wrist flick, which allow you to dismiss notifications, timers and alarms easily.The watch also supports all the rest of the general Apple Watch features inwatchOS 26, including Apple Pay contactless payments, rich notifications, music control, third-party apps and a range of watch faces.View image in fullscreenThe SE 3 runs all the same apps and services as its more expensive siblings.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery life of the SE 3 is a little shorter than the Series 11, lasting about a day and a half of general use, including sleep tracking overnight. Most will have to charge it every other day, particularly if they track any workouts. The SE 3 will last up to seven hours of running tracking with GPS and heart rate, which should be long enough for a marathon. A full charge using the magnetic puck takes about an hour, hitting 70% in 30 minutes.SpecificationsCase size:40mm or 44mmCase thickness:10.7mmWeight:about 26g or 33gProcessor:S10Storage:64GBOperating system:watchOS 26Water resistance:50 metres (5ATM)Sensors:HR (2nd-gen), skin temp, NFC, GNSS, compass, altimeterConnectivity:Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 4, NFC, optional 5GHealth and workout trackingView image in fullscreenThe SE 3 has the same crown and side button as the Series 11 but lacks the metal contacts on the back for taking ECGs.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianOne of the biggest cuts for the SE 3 is the removal of the electrical sensor from the back of the watch, which enables electrocardiograms (ECG) of your heart on the Series and Ultra watches. It also lacks a blood oxygen sensor and hypertension monitoring but it still has an accurate optical heart rate sensor that covers most bases, including high and low heart rate notifications.The SE 3 also has a skin temperature sensor, which is used as part of theVitals app, the sleep tracking and forretrospective ovulation estimatesfor the cycles tracking app. The watch also does a good job of tracking general workouts, including walks, runs, cycles and other common sports and activities with its GPS.The watch also supports offline music playback via Bluetooth headphones, including from subscription services such as Spotify. And it has offline Apple Maps, should you get lost without your phone.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe recycled aluminium body is available in starlight (as pictured) or midnight (black).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple says the battery should last more than1,000 full-charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for£95. Repairs costbetween £195 and £229depending on the model.It contains more than 40% recycled material, including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, rare-earth elements, steel, tin, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impactin its report.PriceThe Apple Watch SE 3 costs from£219(€269/$249/A$399) for the 40mm version or£249(€299/$279/A$449) for 44mm.For comparison, theApple Watch Series 11costs£369and theApple Watch Ultra 3costs£749.VerdictTheApple WatchSE 3 is the best deal in Apple’s smartwatch line this year, offering almost everything that’s great about the Series 11 but at a significantly cheaper price.The new always-on display, S10 chip and watchOS 26 make the SE 3 just as good day to day. The only meaningful feature you miss out on is the ability to take ECGs, but if you know you don’t need it then that’s no loss. The 1.5-day battery life of the 40mm isn’t too bad but the larger 44mm should last a little longer.The limited choice of colours is easily remedied with a bright strap, while the older design with smaller screens, larger bezels and a thicker body is easy to live with for the price.Pros:great value Apple Watch, always-on screen, Apple Pay, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, decent health and fitness tracking, long software support, recycled materials, 50-metre water resistance.Cons:no ECG, no blood oxygen monitoring, no hypertension alerts, old design, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, screen not super bright in sunlight.View image in fullscreenThe new Exactograph face from watchOS 26 looks good on the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsApple WatchAppleWearable technologySmartwatchesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Stability was also found to have infringed Getty’s trademarks in some cases.The judge, Mrs Justice Joanna Smith, said the question of where to strike the balance between the interests of the creative industries on one side and the AI industry on the other was “of very real societal importance”. But she was only able to rule on relatively narrow claims after Getty had to withdraw parts of its case during the trial this summer.Getty Images sued Stability AI for infringement of its intellectual property, alleging the AI company was “completely indifferent to what they fed into the training data” and scraped and copied millions of its images.Boom or bubble? Inside the $3tn AI datacentre spending spreeRead moreThe judgment comes amid a row over how the Labour government should legislate on the issue of copyright and AI, with artists and authors including Elton John, Kate Bush, Dua Lipa and Kazuo Ishigurolobbyingfor protection. Meanwhile, tech companies are calling for wide access to copyrighted content to allow them to build the most powerful and effective generative AI systems.The government is consulting on copyright and AI and has said: “Uncertainty over how our copyright framework operates is holding back growth for our AI and creative industries. That cannot continue.”It is looking at whether to introduce a “text and data mining exception” into UK copyright law, which would allow copyright works to be used to train AI models in the UK unless the rights holder opts their works out of such training, said lawyers at Mishcon de Reya who have been following the issue.Getty had to drop its original copyright claim as there was no evidence the training took place in the UK. But it continued with its suit claiming Stability was still using within its systems copies of its visual assets, which it called the “lifeblood” of its business. It claimed Stability AI had infringed its trademarks because some AI-generated images included Getty watermarks, and that it was guilty of “passing off”.In a sign of the complexity of AI copyright cases, it essentially argued that Stability’s image-generation model, called Stable Diffusion, amounted to an infringing copy because its making would have constituted copyright infringement had it been carried out in the UK.The judge ruled: “An AI model such as Stable Diffusion which does not store or reproduce any copyright works (and has never done so) is not an ‘infringing copy’.” She declined to rule on the passing off claim and ruled in favour of some of Getty’s claims about trademark infringement related to watermarks.In a statement, Getty Images said: “We remain deeply concerned that even well-resourced companies such as Getty Images face significant challenges in protecting their creative works given the lack of transparency requirements. We invested millions of pounds to reach this point with only one provider that we need to continue to pursue in another venue.“We urge governments, including the UK, to establish stronger transparency rules, which are essential to prevent costly legal battles and to allow creators to protect their rights.”Christian Dowell, the general counsel for Stability AI, said: “We are pleased with the court’s ruling on the remaining claims in this case. Getty’s decision to voluntarily dismiss most of its copyright claims at the conclusion of trial testimony left only a subset of claims before the court, and this final ruling ultimately resolves the copyright concerns that were the core issue. We are grateful for the time and effort the court has put forth to resolve the important questions in this case.”Explore more on these topicsIntellectual propertyMedia lawNews photographyArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Inside the $3tn AI datacentre spending spreeRead moreThe warning from Norges Bank, which is the seventh biggest single shareholder in Tesla with a stake worth $17bn, comes two days before the carmaker hosts its annual shareholder meeting.On Thursday, investors will vote on proposals for anunprecedented incentive package that could make Elon Musk the world’s first trillionaire.If Musk increases the value of Tesla from about $1tn to $8.5tn over the next 10 years, Musk will receive new shares that would push his stake in the company from nearly 16% to more than 25%.This would increase the fortunes of the world’s richest man to more than $2tn.The Tesla chair, Robyn Denholm, has argued the vote is essential to retain the 54-year-old Musk as chief executive of the company, writing in a letter to shareholders that the company risks losing “significant value” if he were to leave.Last year, the Norwegian oil fund voted against what was then the biggest pay package in US corporate history of $56bn for Musk. The deal was approved by shareholders in June but wasrejected for a second time by a court in Delaware in December.Nicolai Tangen, the chief executive of the Norwegian fund, invited Musk and other chief executives to dinner in Oslo last year. However, Musk turned down the invite after the fund voted against the $56bn pay deal.A text exchange between Tangen and Musk was revealed in a freedom of information request by the Norwegian business publication DN. It reported that Musk wrote to Tangen in October last year: “When I ask you for a favour which I very rarely do, and you decline, then you should not ask me for one until you’ve done something above nothing to make amends. Friends are as friends do.”Shareholders are divided on the new deal, although two influential shareholder advisory groups – Glass Lewis and ISS – have both recommended that investors reject the $1tn package.Some big pension funds have also opposed the pay package, including the American Federation of Teachers and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest public scheme in the US.Musk, who is Tesla’s biggest single shareholder, can also vote on the proposal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which of those CEOs would you like to run Tesla? It won’t be me.”Tesla has been trying to find ways to keep Musk as chief executive as it grapples with falling sales – global vehicle deliveries fell 13% in the first half of the year. That was partly due to the disruption from the redesign of its popular Model Y car.The carmaker reported a 7% rise in its most recent quarter, as many US consumers rushed to buy electric cars before a $7,500 government purchase incentive ended in September. However, now these tax credits have expired, and the company faces a potential slowdown in its home market.Tesla sales have also been falling across much of Europe: new car registrations dropped 89% in Sweden, 86% in Denmark, 50% inNorwayand 48% in the Netherlands in October, according to local industry data.France was an outlier, where the company made a small gain in sales for the second month in a row.Meanwhile, data from the Chinese Passenger Car Association released on Tuesday, showed that shipments from its Shanghai factory continued to decline, with 61,497 units shipped in October, down about 10% compared with last year.Tesla was approached for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

You wonder where Mo Salah left his shooting boots, or why Virgil van Dijk seems to have forgotten the whole concept of tackling. But this isn’t on the players, it’s on you – or so you’ll tell the press – as you stare at the tactics screen trying to figure out which of the dozens of potential tweaks will change the tide of this depressing spectacle.Football Manager was always the data-driven alternative to the visually opulent Fifa series (now EA Sports FC), but the latest instalment starts to bridge the graphical gap. The 3D-rendered match highlights have been given an upgrade via the new Unity engine, and the results are impressive. Premier League derbies, Champions League finals, and even away matches in the north-east have visual gravitas now, even if the replays and so-called important moments often overstay their welcome. There are no Fifa-style authentic chants ringing around the stadia, but the atmosphere is palpable and your imagination fills in the blanks.View image in fullscreenA tangible impact on tactics … Football Manager 26.Photograph: SegaThis new engine and the elevated matchday experience are the biggest signs of Football Manager’s vision of the future. However, the visual upgrade is about more than spectacle – there is a tangible impact on tactics. While watching a game, you can study your players’ movement on the pitch, making changes accordingly. But when you desperately need to turn things around in front of 45,000 raucous Mackems, data-driven metrics are still king. You might want to switch your build-up strategy to play through the press, or overload one flank with overlapping runs. There are myriad possibilities and you will experiment with them all.The biggest change is the separation of tactical strategies for when you have possession of the ball and when you don’t. It’s the most significant overhaul in a decade, properly representing the intricacies of the modern game. Now you can completely change formation, swap player positions, and give granular instructions that shift depending on which team has the ball. Want your fullback inverting when you reach the final third? It’s not only possible, but they’ll dutifully head back to their rightful position when Alexander Isak is bundled to the floor on the edge of the box.But thereareissues. After a fallow year to manage the transition to the new engine, Football Manager 26 remains remarkably unpolished. It has already received numerous hotfixes to tackle the worst bugs, but many remain, from overlapping UI and subs running on to the pitch in their tracksuits, to menu errors that prevent progress completely.Between matches, the new UI will take some getting used to, especially as some important screens are multiple clicks away when they used to be more accessible. You have all the same information at your disposal (even more, with the addition of women’s leagues), it’s just found in slightly different places. Relearning a lifetime of muscle memory is frustrating and more customisation would be preferable, but it’s a minor gripe that time will soothe.And despite these issues, this is still Football Manager, with all of its delicious tactical minutiae to get lost in. Thanks to the modernised tactics and match engine, making the perfect tactical tweaks to kickstart a stoppage time comeback and silence those oh-so-confident home fans has never felt better. Football Manager 26 provides tangible feedback to your split-second decisions and lets you conceive fictional rivalries that can last for seasons. And when you beat Sunderland with three goals in the final five minutes, the thrill remains unsurpassed.Football Manager 26 is out now, £49.99Explore more on these topicsGamesSports gamesPCPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XNintendo Switch 2Simulation gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

When our very handsome (much better-lookingthan Zohran Mamdani!) and very high-IQ leader Donald Trump gives me a personal shoutout to commend me on what a wonderful job I’m doing. As we all know, a good journalist should always make the rich and powerful feel comfortable.While I wait for that day to come, I’m watching and learning from the head honchos at CBS.Trump appeared on CBS News’s 60 Minuteson Sunday night for his first sit-down with the show in five years and commented on how much better the network has become after its owner, Paramount, was taken over by his billionaire allies, the father-and-son duo Larry and David Ellison.If you watched the interview on TV, you might have missed that particular bit because (weird!) itdidn’t get aired. Nor did the bit where Trump said the network’s new editor-in-chief,Bari Weiss, who according to the FT was picked by David Ellison for herpro-Israel views, was a “great new leader”. Nor did a bit where Trump boasted how “60 Minutes paid me a lotta money,” while referencing his $16m settlement from Paramount for what he called a “deceptively” edited interview with Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes in 2024. Also not fully aired on the TV broadcast: a segment in which the president claimed hedidn’t know a crypto tycoonwho went to prison for breaching money laundering laws, despite the fact that Trump pardoned him. That bit, along with all the others, did appear in thefull text transcriptpublished online.Interviews are edited for length and clarity all the time. But the Trump-friendly editing of an interview conducted by a network now owned by the president’s allies, with a head of news that he thinks is “great”, is part of a broader trend of US media outlets lying down and rolling over for Trump.Look, for example, at all thecorporate donorsthat have rushed to show their fealty to Trump by donating to his extravagant ballroom project. These include Amazon, Apple and Meta, as well as Comcast, which is the parent company of NBCUniversal. Look at Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post, whose editorial board recently published adefence of Trump’s teardownof the White House’s east wing for his ballroom. “Strong leaders reject calcification,” the editorial board wrote. That’s the same Washington Post, of course, thatrefused to publishPulitzer prize winner Ann Telnaes’s cartoon of billionaire Bezos kneeling before Trump.Authoritarians have always sought to control the media. But what’s so terrifying about the current moment isn’t flattering interview edits, it’s the way that Trump and his friends are seeking to edit our relationship with reality. Take Elon Musk, who helped propel Trump to his second term. First Musk bought Twitter – a very convenient way of controlling online discourse – and now he has launched hisown AI-poweredversion of Wikipedia called Grokipedia. “The goal here is to create an open source, comprehensive collection of all knowledge,” Muskposted on Xlast week. “Then place copies of that etched in a stable oxide in orbit, the Moon and Mars to preserve it for the future.”Forget stable oxides – the real goal here, you could argue, is instability; to muddy truth and knowledge so thoroughly that reality itself is up for debate. Grokipedia, I’m sure I don’t need to tell you, is already being found to be riddled with factual errors; largely because it pulls from unreliable sources. “Chatroom contributions are given equal status with serious academic work,” one academictold the Guardian. When you make it difficult to separate opinions from facts, it becomes a lot easier to manipulate people.AI-generated videos take the muddling of reality to a whole new level. Fox News, owned by the Murdoch family, recently reported on videos circulating on social media in which Black food stamp beneficiaries were threatening to ransack stores if the US government shutdown stopped their benefits. There were various clues that the videos were AI-generated racist rage-bait, but Fox ignored all those and presented them as real. Eventually it corrected its story to note the videos were AI-generated, but the lie had already travelled halfway around the world. And no doubt Musk’s Grokipedia will soon etch that lie in a stable oxide in orbit, to preserve it for the future.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskSocial mediaTikTokArtificial intelligence (AI)Jeff BezoscommentShareReuse this content"

So why the panic about trans players?Lesley RyderAngel City’s Elizabeth Eddy was rebuked by her own teammates for an op-ed on trans players. It’s easy to understand their objectionsTue 4 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 09.12 ESTShareOn 26 October, Angel City FC’s Elizabeth Eddy made her first post on X in nearly two years. In it, Eddy in essence responded to the Guardian’s report that the NWSL hadquietly droppedits inclusion policy for trans and intersex athletes, leaving the league’s future stance on the matter undecided.The New York Post gave Eddy’s writing a signal boost the next day,republishing it in full.“I’m concerned that without clarity about who the league is for, it will lose its identity and its momentum,” Eddy wrote in the piece, which broadly advocated for a ban on trans athletes from theNWSL, to protect “the integrity of women’s sports” so the league does not lose “its identity and its momentum.”The US’s biggest pro women’s sports unions have found strength togetherRead moreIt’s unclear how Eddy thinks the NWSL’s integrity has been harmed – either under its former policy that allowed trans athletes in the league, or its current lack of one. The league, now in its 13th season, has developed a clear identity. It’s highly competitive. It’s commercially and culturally powerful. It’s, well, anintegralpart of the global women’s soccer scene. The league’s momentum appears to be largely fine, too – to pick just two data points, viewership has grown every season, and in 2026 the league will expand to 16 teams, nearly doubling its size in the last five years.Eddy cites the English FA’srecent banon transgender athletes from women’s soccer as a success story. Yet England’sbanis believed to affect only 20 or so grassroots players out of 5.5 million registered athletes. There’s reason to believe the effect would be similarly negligible here in the US. In 2021, when the league’s trans inclusion policy took effect, the NWSL hadtwotrans players: Quinn and Kumi Yokoyama. Both have since left, and no out trans players currently play in the league. On the 2025 season’s opening weekend, the league welcomed its1,000thplayer. That’s just two out trans players out of over 1,000 in league history.Eddy’s piece is written as if there is a pipeline of trans players set to take over the league at a moment’s notice. There is no such thing. There are currently no out trans players competing at a professional level in the United States. Federal legislation expresslyprohibitstrans players from competing in NCAA college soccer. And aside from all that, multiple peer-reviewedstudieshave shown that trans athletes have no biological advantages over cis athletes.In the absence of out trans people, transphobic attacks have continued along racial lines. When the Orlando Pride’s Barbra Banda was named the BBC’s player of the year, a wave of online abuse followed. The NWSL waspainfully slowto act in support of their star player. The Kansas City Current’sTemwa Chawingaand her sister Tabitha have experienced similar abuse. It’s all derived either from the fraught world of gender testing standards, the players not looking outwardly feminine enough to some, or some combination of both those factors.In her piece, Eddy does manage to identify that there is harm in legislating bodies in this way, saying “This uncertainty serves no one, as questions and controversy abound over intersex and transgender athletes.”But she doesn’t seem to realize how her op-ed further enables those harms. AsSuzanne Wrack put itin the Guardian earlier this year: “What the hysteria over an almost impossible hypothetical situation does is open the door for transphobic and racist targeting of female football players and creates an environment that makes trans people, young trans people, or those questioning their gender identity at grassroots level feel as if they don’t belong in football or sport.”This harm is exponentially increased by the New York Post’s shameful decision to run Eddy’s op-ed with a photo of Banda, who like many athletes of color are frequently targeted by transphobic attacks. And Eddy’s own teammates know it.“That article does not speak for this team in this locker room,” Angel City FC captain Sarah Gorden told reporters on Thursday. “We don’t agree with the things written for a plethora of reasons, but mostly the undertones come across as transphobic and racist as well. The article calls for genetic testing on certain players, and it has a photo of an African player as a headline. And that’s very harmful. As a mixed woman, with a Black family, I’m devastated by the undertones of this article … And there are players in this league and in this locker room that are directly harmed by what was written in the article.”Even if one were to ignore all that and believe that trans inclusion constitutes a real problem for the NWSL, it’s hard to see how it would outrank any number of other issues that have actually blunted the league’s momentum and affected its integrity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Six former San Diego Wave employees aresuingthe club and the NWSL alleging, in part, racial and disability discrimination, sexual harassment, and negligence to prevent discrimination and sexual harassment. The Guardianreportedthe NWSL denied wrongdoing, saying they had “no duty of care” to the six employees.There are issues concerning player care. In May, Angel City defender Savy King collapsed on the field, requiring emergency medical treatment before leaving the field on a stretcher. On-field play resumed, even though players were visibly distraught. The NWSLPA called on the league torevisittheir medical protocols. Then, in August, when a nationally televised match between the Orlando Pride and the KC Current faced an extreme heat delay, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman reportedlythreatenedto fine the Current over a disagreement in the league’s extreme heat procedures.There are more pedestrian, on-field issues too, as European leagues like the WSL grow in financial might enough to start attractingsome of the NWSL’s best playersaway from the league and country where they made their careers.Trans athletes did not factor into any one of these issues. And it’s unlikely they will, regardless of whether Eddy’s suggestions come to pass.Lesley Ryder is a writer and host covering women’s soccer in Chicagoland.Explore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballUS sportsTransgendercommentShareReuse this content"

My new policy has achieved two thingsTue 4 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 18.06 ESTShare“You know I could help you with biology,” I say, a little too eagerly.“What are the two types of immunity?” my daughter asks, casually flipping her eggs.“Innate and adaptive.”“What do ribosomes do?”“They translate messenger RNA into amino acids.”“Wow, are you a doctor or something?” she deadpans, before scooping up her eggs and sauntering away, leaving my offer untouched.Next, her younger brother avows that he will fail chemistry.“I can help!” I volunteer. “I did chem at school, you know.”“All good,” he says, shrugging. “But if you ever need help writing a column, just ask.”Chafing, I think they might be taking their cue from their older sibling, now at university. Early in school he adopted a policy of non-interference, which is to say he did not brook my interference. Organised and self-sufficient, he did fine without my input but I wanted a front seat to the performance his teachers lauded.As my son prepares to graduate high school, I’m feeling nostalgic for the many parenting milestones I’ve bid farewell | Vivienne PearsonRead moreI itched to read the essays he wrote, the debates he argued and the winning scholarship applications he crafted. But somehow he always forgot to save the drafts or bring home his work. The night before his graduation speech, when I asked to hear it, he retorted I could wait like everyone else. This caused me to grumble that I paid the fees but got no favours. My pitiful plea died the death it deserved.My journey into the crevices of my children’s educational lives deserves context. I am the daughter of a devout academic. Nearly everyone in my Indian family used education as the stairway to success. We are a people devoid of athletes, artists and entrepreneurs and our highest praise is to be called “educated”.It was a foregone conclusion that if there was one area of my children’s lives I would care deeply about, it was their education. I wanted them to benefit from every bit of my abilities, experience and connections. But while they were savvy enough to introduce their friends to me, they themselves were having none of it. By now, I have heard every version of “What would you know?” – and not all as polite!When I complained to a childhood friend, she commiserated before disclosing that her children wouldn’t let her near their college admission essays or even reveal where they were applying.So I proceeded to make a virtue out of a necessity. Earlier this year, I told my kids that their education is in their hands.My job is to provide access and set expectations and, of course, be available when needed, but I am done micromanaging their homework, their devices, their study and their sleep. If they choose to scroll on their phone until midnight and wake up late, they will pay the price. If they make better choices, they will reap the rewards. I quit the parent portals (that I never really used) and mass deleted discursive school emails about every incursion, excursion and wellbeing seminar.I trusted that my hands-off approach to education could not be more dissatisfying than the hands-on one.Without realising it, I was emulating my parents, who when it came to education practised almost a monastic silence. When my brother and I succeeded, they were unfazed. When we failed a subject or wanted to drop out, they were unfazed. They listened, nodded and got on with whatever they were doing. Now I saw that this wasn’t indifferent parenting but parenting of the best kind – implicit trust mixed with ample space to allow us to forge our own path.My new policy has achieved two things. The time not spent dissecting teacher feedback or the minutiae of the humanities curriculum has been more happily spent on conversations about the values we want to live by or what makes for a satisfying career, and less cerebral things like the aesthetics of the eyebrow shave andthe broccoli cut.It has been instructive (and humbling) to discover how little my kids “miss” the role I had taken so seriously. They manage their studies, regulate their device use and monitor their bedtime, all while improving their grades.Instead of pleading, “Can you do some work?” I began hearing, “I will be studying in my room.” Instead of the nightly argument about phones, I simply said goodnight and turned in. Now, when they didn’t do well, they were miffed at themselves. When they did well, they had themselves to be proud of.Why didn’t someone convince me earlier that the key to intrinsic motivation was to pull back on extrinsic drivers?As my eldest sits his final school exam, I’m grateful to the fine teachers who helped me parent him | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreThis month there is abundant advice for Australian students sitting their end-of-school exams. They are (rightly)reminded that their mark is not their destinyand the usual tips on sleep, diet and exercise follow.But in a sign of the times there is just as much advice for the modern parent to manage the assumedhigh stress of parenting a child sitting the end-of-year exams.Should the parent take leave or keep working? Is it healthier to maintain distance or anticipate a child’s slightest need? How to navigate the line between unreasonable demand and healthy expectation?Of course there are students who need extra wraparound support – and they deserve every bit of it to help them thrive.Australia has one of the highest achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students. At year 9 level,the gap in attainmentis over three years in numeracy and over four years in literacy.It seems as if the neediest students are being left behind while the children of the comfortably off are asking their parents to let go.Meanwhile, I can’t help thinking that reading about managing parental anxiety seems like a recipe for developing anxiety. If it never crossed your mind that your child’s grades reflected your parenting, might the suggestion fuel doubt? All this while psychologists continue to remind us of the enormous value of letting our children figure things out andyes, even fail.On the eve of my children’s exams, my friend, chastened by her own experience, texts me:“Remember to keep your mouth shut and your door open.”It might just be the most practical advice for the modern parent.I am taking it.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

Is there anyone outside Planet Rachel who couldn’t see that truth two years ago?Tue 4 Nov 2025 08.42 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 15.24 ESTShareThis would actually have been quite an understandable day for Rachel Reeves tocry at work. “I’m really clear,” the chancellor told the CBI less than a year ago, “I’m not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes.” Can I shock you …? “We did wipe the slate clean,” she continued less than 12 months ago. “[We] put public finances and public services on a firm footing, and as a result we won’t have to do a budget like thisever again.” Again: can I shock you …?So, then, to Reeves’s podium appearancefrom Downing Street this morning. Vibes-wise, it was like knowing you were going to be very incompetently mugged in three weeks’ time, but having to listen to a speech from the mugger about the context of it all. Or maybe a speech from an asteroid trying to get out in front of what people are going to say about it when it craters the West Midlands.Reeves’s delivery is more wooden than the panelling behind her today, and has all the verve of being informed that we’re experiencing higher than normal call volumes. Your estimated wait time to the budget is 22 days. There were moments in this outing where it felt like the chancellor’s job had already been automated. She must have been absolutely unplayable on the complaints line at HBOS.Anyhow, please listen carefully as her menu options have recently changed. “The world has thrown even more challenges our way,” Reeves explained, with the air of someone who spent the four months between the general election victory and her first budget last autumn telling everyone how utterly abysmal the situation was, and then being blindsided by the collapse in consumer,businessandinvestor confidence, and a desperately unhelpful economic climate of foreboding about what was to come. Luckily Reeves had a cunning plan up her sleeve back then:raising employers’ national insurancecontributions, which took care of any last remaining traces of optimism.Yet once again this morning, the government was opting to serve as Cassandra for its own forthcoming fiscal event. Maybe because it went so well last time. Having absolutely sworn before the election that there were “no ifs, no ands, no buts” to her tax pledges, Reeves today really wanted to introduce you to Mr If, Miss And and President But. We just need Mrs Fully Costed to complete the set.A lot of things seemed to have eaten Reeves’s homework, but one of the biggest bites was apparently taken by budget watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR’s decisionto downgradeits productivity forecasts for the economy was treated as a serious curveball, as opposed to an arguably belatedly realistic engagement with the facts. For someone who spent half this speech and the Q&A after it announcing that she had to deal with “the world as I find it”, Reeves certainly gave the impression that she could dismiss gravity or the first law of thermodynamics as just an opinion by some unelected physics.Another of the challenges the world seems to have thrown her way is the discovery that you cannot get a single spending cut through the parliamentaryLabourparty. Again, if only there’d been signs. Reeves didn’t put it that way, obviously. She said she didn’t think it was fair “to blame the parliamentary Labour party for the OBR’s supply-side review”. And I don’t think it’s fair that a good half of the parliamentary Labour party would not have the first clue what the words “supply-side” even mean. So we’re all having to live with injustice.Other omissions? It was disappointing that no one asked the chancellor if she defines herself as a “working person”, one of that mythical tribe on whom taxes were never, ever, ever going to be raised. Last week, Sam Coates at Skygot hold of the definitionof “working people” that the Treasury is supposedly working around ahead of the budget later this month, which is apparently the bottom two-thirds of earners – which is to say, no one earning more that £45,000 a year. “Extraordinary if true,” the former IFS director Paul Johnsonobserved drily. But aspirational, surely, for many experienced plumbers and train drivers to learn that they are no longer working people, and have passed with immediate effect into Labour’s upper category: those with the broadest shoulders/the privileged few/fat cats. Under this definition, a chancellor definitely isn’t a working person, even though Rachel is always telling you she’s working tirelessly to do this or that for the country.Then again, the chancellor does love a simplistic way of putting things – black holes, fixing house foundations – so here’s one for her. Why does she seem to be catching up only now with things many people told herbefore the last election? Why is the long-term state of the British economy a surprise only to Reeves and to the cadre of full-time dreamers who believed Starmer’s Labour were “the grownups”? As so many made clear before the general election, Labour’s promises on tax and blandishments about growth were totally unrealistic and un-thought-through. In fact, they were such obvious obfuscations or deliberate misdirections that for my money they amounted to lying. Can it genuinely be that the chancellor didn’t catch herself on to the glaring realities of “the books” – which are effectively always open, as the IFSpointed out at the time? No, it can’t. As she put it about the details of the public finances during the run-up to last year’s election: “We’ve got the Office for Budget Responsibility now … You don’t need to win an election to find out.” Halloween might have passed, but huge numbers of these quotes are going to haunt Reeves for the foreseeable future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Clearly, Reeves would love to think otherwise, but it feels already too late for her to be successfully honest. The run-up to a general election it was going to win by a landslide was Labour’s moment to be honest. In terms of its public standing on the economy, almost everything since has flowed from that conscious decision not to level with voters about things it honestly must have known at the time. By way of some speech filler today, Reeves droned vaguely about making the UK an enticing investment for futuristic industries like AI and biotech. No doubt we’re all in favour of that – but for her own personal future, the chancellor would be a lot better off attracting a time machine firm.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistA year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa CrerarOn Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back at another extraordinary year, with special guests, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.

MPs have been so worried about asylum seekers delivering their Friday night pizza that they’ve spent parliamentary time discussing Deliveroo et al’s business models. In response, the government has repeatedly reassured us, in the somewhat Mills & Boon-style phrasing of Yvette Cooper, when she was home secretary, that it’s “surging enforcement” to tackle the problem.Solutions suggested include Keir Starmer’s digital ID cards,requirementsfor increased “right to work” checks, andnew data-sharing agreementsin which the Home Office gives delivery companies the addresses of asylum hotels to try to stop asylum seekers working. All of these measures are intended to stop migrants earning money if they lack the legal right to work, which suggests that the government thinks those migrants are the main problem in the hidden economy.But the government’s own commissioned research on the issue suggests something very different. Reports in2011,2017and2023laid out the facts of the UK’s hidden economy, meaning work that is in legal sectors but that people are failing to register for regulatory or tax purposes (rather than illicit activities, such as drug-dealing and sex work, which are wholly or partly criminalised). According to the most recent estimate, about 8.8% of our adult population is working under the table; that’s approximately 4.4 million people. There are700,000 to 900,000 undocumented migrantsin the UK with no right to work and a further224,000 asylum seekers awaiting a decision, many of whom will also be barred from earning. Even if all of those migrants were working illegally, they would comprise a small minority of hidden economy activity. Moreover, the research finds no statistically significant difference in proportions of workers across urban versus rural areas, nor different geographical regions, despite substantial differences in migrant populations. Conclusion? The hidden economy is not a migrant problem.Instead, it’s a problem of the economy. Of making ends meet. Of getting by. Of paying our rising bloody bills. Because the majority of people working off the bookslive in the most deprived areas of the UK. They are alsomost likely to be young(aged 18 to 24), with participation declining with age, and earning very little from it, with 50% of activities generating below £250 each time. And they are mostly “moonlighters”, meaning that their hidden work supplements other officially declared earnings; it’s top-up income in a high-cost economy.Take Dennis, now a fully qualified electrician. He used to work cash-in-hand while he trained, because his earnings were so low. “By the time I was finished [paying living costs such as food and rent], I was left with nothing,” he says. “We used to do a bit of cash-in-hand, which helped me get by.” For reference, the current national apprenticeship wageis £7.55 per hour, far below the minimum wage. His story is one of several featured inresearch led by Danny Buckley of Loughborough Business School. They found that undeclared work was simply normal for people in the early years of careers such as car mechanic, hairdresser, plumber, painter and decorator, tree surgeon, heating engineer and, like Dennis, electrician.That’s the workers, but there are also the customers to consider, and that’s where you and I come in. The same research identified customers as a driving force behind the hidden economy. Ethan, a heating engineer, told the researchers that “you do feel pressure from customers, which drives all prices down […] The only way I can keep cutting costs would be to either use cheaper materials, not pay everything or employ people off the record.” Andrew and Carl, both mechanics running garages, described customers asking to “lose the VAT”. It does feel rather obvious when you start seeing the hidden economy in this way, doesn’t it? Who hasn’t wished that the quote from a builder or car mechanic was lower? And if itislow, who’s checking why, instead of feeling relief that things just got a little easier?This rather mundane picture, of an economy constituted by ordinary people trying to increase earnings or lower bills, is far removed from politicians’ misleading portrayals. Instead of upstanding apprentices and harried families, we’ve heard repeated concerns about a highly specific business type: migrant-run high street shops and services. Or, as our democratic representatives put it, “bogus barber shops” and “fake vape shops”.Now, I’m not suggesting that all those businesses are always legitimate. But the National Centre for Social Research found that “activities that are more likely to be in the hidden economy arenot necessarilythe most common activities in the hidden economy”. In plain terms, there are some businesses in which flouting the law is extremely common. But they do not form the largest part of the hidden economy, which is actually taking place across a much wider range of sectors. General household maintenance was the servicemost likely to be purchased from the hidden economy.Yet highlighting these particular businesses is such a hot trend in Westminster that you’d think a kind of anti-PR firm was doing a promotional push. And of course, it is. It’s Reform UK. But Labour is desperately trying to keep its voter share by mimicking Reform’s style and its penchant for ill-informed policies. Eighteen months ago, Reform’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, made headlines with his assertion about the dodginess of “Turkish barbers”. A year later, the Labour/Co-operative MP Paul Waughstated in parliamentthat “honest businesses are being undermined by the menace of illegal working, particularly by illegal migrants from Iran and Iraq in bogus barber shops and fake vape shops”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The right to demonstrate is a given, but to menace private homes is just not rightTue 4 Nov 2025 04.16 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 06.51 ESTShareEvery day, I hear appalling stories of the abuse suffered by people who step forward to represent their communities and serve our country. It is shocking to see the level of harassment and intimidation faced by those in our parliament, our town halls and elsewhere in public service. Every story I hear only increases my determination to stop it happening and keep those who serve safe.The horrific murders of my friendsJo Cox and David Amesswere not isolated tragedies. They sent shockwaves through parliament and our democracy. Their loss left behind grief and a fear that shapes our politics.Robust political debate remains a vital part of our democracy – it must be protected. However, the increasing abuse faced by those in public office is notpart of that discourse.At last year’s general election, more than half of all candidatesreceived abuse or intimidation. Nearly all current members of parliament have experienced it.Some sitting MPs are now beginning to self-censor: changing how they go about their daily lives and how they engage with constituents, even what they say and maybe how they vote, out of concern for their safety and that of their staff and families.The diversity of people willing to stand for election is shrinking. Some parties are already finding it harder to recruit women. They are bearing theoverwhelming bruntof threats and abuse online – and sickeningly, it is often sexualised. Meanwhile, the abuse facing public office holders such as mayors, councillors and police and crime commissioners – and even candidates for these roles – today is significantly worse than in the past. We’ve seen a disturbing escalation both online and in person.Bricks have been thrown through windows while children were asleep. Threats sent through the post. Staff members have faced vile online abuse. And many have been verbally and physically harassed on their local high street. I talk to those affected, and I know how deeply it strikes at them and their families. Left unchecked, it will have a chilling effect on our democracy, with good people stepping away and good people deciding not to step forward in the first place.We run the real risk of fewer voices contributing to our national debate, and our democracy will be all the poorer for it. No one should be deterred from standing for public office because they fear for their safety.Unless we stand together against this, our democracy will be insidiously undermined – through a subtle, persistent and deeply corrosive erosion of voice. I am not willing to accept this as some kind of new normal.As security minister, I am totally committed and determined to ensure that those who take part in our democracy are protected, and that those responsible are deterred and punished.This is why we are bringing in anew lawto restrict protests outside the homes of public office holders.This robust measure addresses existing legislation, which does not adequately reflect the impact of protests at the private homes of public office holders, nor account for the nature of demonstrations we have increasingly seen – sustained, targeted and designed to intimidate.In Britain, we must hold firm to the principle that public service should never come at the cost of personal safety. Yet in recent years, we’ve seen protests deliberately timed to coincide with children leaving for school, families disrupted in their own homes and elected representatives forced to weigh their duty against the wellbeing of those closest to them.This is not how it should be. We cannot bring political disagreement to the doorstep of someone’s family. We must not make children collateral in a campaign. We cannot use intimidation as a tool of persuasion. Respect – for each other, for our institutions and for the private lives of those who serve – is absolutely fundamental to our democracy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a cherished freedom, and there are many appropriate places to exercise it – public spaces and parliament itself. But the doorstep of a private home is not one of them.This new legislation is a necessary and proportionate step to safeguard democratic participation and ensure that those who serve can do so without fear for their families. It is about drawing a line – not against protest, but against intimidation.It’s part of a wider strategy to strengthen democratic protections that this government is driving forward, through the defending democracy taskforce, which I chair, working closely with the police and parliament.I will not let up in this work to protect our democratic institutions and processes. Public service should never come with fear for one’s safety. We all have a role to play in defending our democracy from those who seek to undermine it.

The chancellor will have to submit her major decisions to her official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), this week. This means no more discussion, debate and seat-switching between No 10 and No 11 – once the spreadsheet is sent it is rarely changed. I hope that it includes an increase in the basic rate of income tax, something we haven’t seen since the 1970s. It is hard to see how else Reeves can navigate the three trials of this budget: fixing the bottom line, supporting growth and distributing the pain fairly.First, the hole in the public finances must be filled. New Resolution Foundation analysis estimates that borrowing is on course to be£14bn higher than it was in March– enough to break her fiscal rules. That’s smaller than some have speculated but still leaves a mountain to climb. And the chancellor will need to do more than match this shortfall – and build a far stronger financial buffer against her fiscal rules – if she is to reassure the markets and avoid coming back for even more tax rises or spending cuts at the next budget. Doing so would be unusual – typically chancellors under-react to bad economic news and overreact to good news. Only one budget in the past 14 years has responded to a worse underlying forecast by more than making up for the deterioration (George Osborne, in 2012).Second, the budget must be pro-growth. The biggest cause of higher borrowing is expected to be the judgment by the OBR that the UK’s post-financial-crisis stagnation will persist. The government is right to try to find policy that might turn this around. But even the OBR’smore pessimistic viewof growth is likely to be better than we’ve seen since the pandemic. So, as the Queen of Hearts said to Alice, the OBR will say to the chancellor: “It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.”Third, the chancellor will have to distribute the pain fairly. Families have barely emerged from a cost of living crisis. Food prices remain high and energy billsare risingjust as the temperature falls. While we no longer have “crisis” levels of inflation, that crisis was scarring and inflation is still high, atalmost double its target rate. So, a budget that lowers rather than stokes inflation is good politics and good economics. With inflation already uncomfortably high, the Bank of England might well respond to tax measures that further increase priceswith higher interest rates, raising the interest payments that both households and the government must make. So forget any increases to VAT at this budget.That leaves the chancellor needing to find around £25bn of tax rises, according to our analysis, and in a way that doesn’t damage investment, and that supports growth.Clearly, increasing income tax can help raise money. On its own, each 1p rise in income taxraises £10bn. Preferably, if income tax was increased 1p while employee national insurance was cut by the same amount, then pay packets would be unaffected, while everyone who doesn’t pay national insurance would see a rise. There are a fair chunk of those people and so substantial sums can still be raised this way.Those who would pay more include pensioners, who should bear some of the cost of this budget. After all, they have been one of the biggest beneficiaries from the increases in public spending. An astonishing £9 in every £10 of the additional day-to-day departmental spending from this Labour governmentwent to the NHS, a public service used disproportionately by older people. Yet pensioners currently pay lower rates of tax on their income than those in work. An income tax rise would only affect those who have enough to pay it. The bumperrise in the basic state pensionnext year would still leave all pensioners on less than £40,000 a year better off, even after a 2p income tax rise. Nor does this unreasonably punish those who saved, as savings into a pension can be made free of income tax.In thinking about the effects of tax rises, we must avoid comparing them to a fantasy world in which no pain is needed. But the economic case against raising income tax – reducing the enthusiasm of employees to earn more – can be mitigated by reducing national insurance at the same time. Landlords would face higher tax bills, but with the total supply of housing unlikely to be affected we should not expect a big change in rents. The tax advantages of self-employment over payrolled employment,now at a record high, would be reduced. Tackling this distortion would be good for growth.We must stop hoping we will magically wake up from the nightmare of a country beleaguered by low growth. There is no cheap route to world-class universal healthcare in an ageing society. It’s time to face reality. None of this is politically easy, and manifesto pledges should not be broken lightly. But an income tax rise would be a response sufficiently serious to meet the moment Britain faces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then the strain began to showTue 4 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 11.40 ESTShareThere aren’t many people who understand the stress that the celebrity Traitors Cat Burns and Alan Carr have been feeling as their stintwearing that famous green cloakdraws to an end – but I do. I spent four weeks lying, cheating and murdering friends and colleagues in our office version of The Traitors.I almost lost my mind.Everyone watches The Traitors and sees the contestants, Traitors and Faithfuls alike, act irrationally and make poor decisions and thinks: “That wouldn’t be me. I’d be rational. I wouldn’t beLinda from series three, immediately giving the game away. I’d be Harry from series two,emotionally manipulatinga girl with a colostomy bag.”Reader, I was once like you. I was so certain of my rationality that on New Year’s Day Itweeted my confidenceI would be “extremely normal” if I were ever on the show.Little did I know that one of my colleagues was donning metaphorical eyeliner and fringe to act as Claudia Winkleman. Just a week later, I received a Slack explaining that three of my colleagues and I had been selected as Traitors in a game in my office. I’m not sure why God chose this example to teach me a lesson about being careful what you wish for. Or was it about pride? I’m just glad the stakes were so low. And maybe his message should have been clearer.The rules were simple. Everyone in the office had been made either a Faithful or a Traitor. In the morning, the Traitors’ latest victim would be announced on Slack. In the evening, we’d vote on who we wanted to banish. If there were any Traitors left at the end of the game, the Traitors would win the grand prize, a day of annual leave. On paper, it all seems like a low-stakes team-building exercise. No one was competing so they could afford a bionic hand, asNicky did in season one. And I’m sure the colleague who donned the metaphorical eyeliner as our Claudia didn’t intend to induceMcCarthy-level paranoiain me. But she did.I left the Slack channel we were in at once. The idea of forming a brand-new group called “Project costs”, with four people from entirely different parts of the business, seemed too suspicious to me. We moved to a WhatsApp group, our digital turret. It was easier than trying to have hooded meetings in the supply cupboard after work.We called the group “Nan’s birthday” so that it could be open on our work laptops without attracting suspicion. To make it seem more authentic, I made the group photo an actual photo of my nanna at her 90th birthday. Only when I’d saved my fellow Traitors’ numbers under fake names was I happy that the digital level of OpSec was high enough.In person, it was a different story. We were subjected to a 24/7, cross-platform interrogation. WhatsApps, pitch meetings, client lunches – all became accusatory terrain. Lying became second nature. I lied to colleagues as I warmed up my lunch in the microwave, I lied at work drinks, I even lied to my manager who worked in a different office, and wasn’t even playing the game.I spoke about almost nothing else. I’d wake my girlfriend up, boring her stupid about what Faithfuls had which theories, and who had nearly been caught, and who we were going to murder next. I dreamed about it.There was a farcical moment where I discussed the game with some colleagues on my PoliticsJOE podcast. Through gritted teeth, I claimed to be a Faithful. Now I wasn’t just lying to people I knew. Ifelt like Richard Nixon.On the way up to Manchester with two Faithful colleagues, we didn’t talk about anything apart from who we thought were Traitors and Faithfuls. We turned the spotlight on one another, each subjected to about 45 minutes of scrutiny. After my turn, my colleagues looked at each other.“You’d have to be some sort of psychopath to be able to lie like that,” one said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now we’re letting Moscow beat us at our own gameJoseph PearsonThe Berlin airlift was a cold war victory that relied on a persuasive story about starving civilians. But was it true?Tue 4 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 11.57 ESTShareWe in the west used to play dirty – and during the cold war, we were good at it. Nowadays, we leave grey-zone tactics and hybrid warfare to Russia, which is winning the disinformation war. Europe’s pride in playing by the rules might just be democracy’s achilles heel.The Berlin airlift is a good example ofwhat we once did well– and have since forgotten. The cold war arguably began and ended in Berlin, bookended by the 1948-9 airlift and the fall of the wall in 1989. The former was the largest air reliefoperation in history. It supplied Berlin when Stalin tried to force out the western allies. In parallel, the west used radio (RIAS, or Radio in the American Sector, a precursor tothe CIA-fundedRadio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty), and strengthened soft power with cultural missions such as the British-stagedShakespeare in the rubble, and education through American-runlibraries and courses.The biggest western tool, however, was disinformation. The allied airlift cost the equivalent ofalmost $3bn today, and needed a persuasive narrative to win public support. It’s one that almost everyone still believes today: Berlin was blockaded, its land routes sealed, and women and children were starving.Except, while there was an airlift of supplies, there was no Berlin blockade.In the National Archives at Kew, I found documents from 1948 showing, in the Foreign Office’s words, “the blockade of Berlin is NOT a siege” and that “movement in and out of Germans is possible all the time”, for example to obtain food. A press campaign, however, pushed for “a massive and sensational story of air power applied to humanitarian ends”. The US secretary of state, George C Marshall,argued via telegramto “utilize to the utmost present propaganda advantage our position”, “stressing [Soviet] responsibility for … threatened starvation of civilian population”. The story was so effective, it became a cold war myth that stuck. In the UK, teenagers stilllearn for their GCSEsthat Berlin was blockaded by Stalin and risked starvation.Was it right to mislead the public in 1948 and 1949? No. Did it win full support in the UK and US? Yes. The airlift even won Harry Truman an unexpectedre-election that November.What have we learned – and unlearned – since then? European democracies pride themselves on being more truthful than the Russians (and the US). The integrity of information – transparency, facts, and evidence – builds trust.Western media need to be better than rumour mills and bots. And what’s happening inRussiais bad enough without embellishment.Our tactics, however, could be tougher. We are losing the information war to Russia because tools we relied on during the cold war – many from the time of the airlift–are dying quiet deaths. Radio and news agencies set up to broadcast to eastern Europe are in the crosshairs: Trumptried to killRFE and Radio Liberty. UK ministers are rightly accused of being “asleep at the wheel”, with the threats to soft-power funding, such as to the British Council. The German counterpart in cultural diplomacy, theGoethe Institut, is being stripped of funds.In the US, the Global Engagement Center,set up in 2016 to expose disinformation,was shut downby Trump earlier this year.EU counterparts, such as theEuropean External Action Service(EEAS) and theEast StratCom Task Force, focus more on monitoring threats than taking offensive action. As the Royal United Services Institutewarns, the west has failed “to come up with a meaningful response or strengthen its public outreach …to counter Russian disinformation efforts.”Because Russia is winning hearts and minds, not just in Europe but also in theglobal south. Troll factories, cyber-attacks,deepfakes, and fake news campaigns – aboutdirty bombs and bioweaponsbeing developed in Ukraine, for example – tip public opinion in regions where the west has lost its moral high ground. Putin calls the west’s tactics a “dangerous, bloody, and dirty game”,but he’s projecting. It’s the game he’s playing.View image in fullscreenA Russian MIG-31 fighter jet flying above the Baltic sea after violating Estonian air space in September 2025Photograph: FORSVARSMAKTEN/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat would playing dirty look like? It would mean acting with the same zeal and guts that helped the west stand up to Stalin – and win. It would mean decisive action on the same lines as the EU’s 2022suspension of Russian propaganda broadcasters, RT and Sputnik, and the US Cyber Command’s 2018attack on a Russian troll factory, the Internet Research Agency, in order to stop midterm election interference. It would mean engaging hacktivists – because we rarely hear about western cyber victories against Russia – although this may be because they make “less noise”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But as Russia sends outmenace drones, testing Europe’s borders, we spend our time worrying rather than pushing back.What we’ve lost most since the airlift, when the US and UK poured into Europe money, information power, and military might for the first time in peacetime, is mojo. We held back Stalin with a remarkable resilience, and one damn great, if not entirely true, story. It’s good we’ve grown more truthful, but not that we’ve lost fighting spirit. Many seem too weary and disenchanted to fight for democracy’s advantages.That’s why, when it comes to (dis)information, the Russians can confidently say: “We’re winning.”Joseph Pearson is a historian who lectures at the Barenboim-Said Akademie and New York University in Berlin.

Alternative first responders are better placed to de-escalate tension and reduce harmMon 3 Nov 2025 21.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 21.02 ESTShareWhen police tasered and killed Clare Nowland – a 95-year-old aged care resident with dementia – after her nursing home called triple zero for help managing her behaviour, her family were devastated and the public was shocked.How could a frail and elderly woman on a walking frame, albeit grasping a steak knife, die in such a violent way?Nowland’s deathintensified calls to explore alternatives to police officers as first responders, especially when people are experiencing mental health crises, and especially among vulnerable communities who have historically had a justified fear of the police.‘He begged not to die’: partner of man who died after being restrained by police joins calls to change mental health responseRead moreShe was one of at least five people who died in 2023 after interactions with New South Wales police, including “gentle soul”Steve Pampalian, shot in his driveway suffering a psychotic episode; beloved sonJesse Deacon, shot by police after a concerned neighbour called triple zero when seeing Jesse had self-harmed, and Newcastle motherKrista Kachwho died after officers forced their way into her apartment after a nine-hour standoff and shot her with beanbag rounds.“The only person in danger when the police broke into our mother’s home, and the many hours leading up to that moment, was our mother,” her family said in a statement at the time.The toll continues. There have been five deaths involving police in similar circumstances since the start of this year.In May,Kumanjayi White, a 24-year-old disabled Warlpiri man from Yuendumu, died after being restrained by police in the Coles supermarket in Alice Springs.In April, Abdifatah Ahmed, a Somali refugee experiencing homelessness, in mental distress and allegedly brandishing a knife, was shot dead by Victorian police.In June, NSW police shot a 52-year-old man said to have been holding a knife, after a three-hour siege at a Elderslie caravan park. A neighbour called triple zero out of concern for the man’s welfare.In South Australia in May, police restrained father of two, Gaurav Kundi, after witnessing an “altercation” with a woman on the street. Kundi, 42, “became unresponsive” during the arrest anddied two weeks laterin hospital.In July, Taite Collins watched and filmed as his partner, Collin Burling, was surrounded by officers at their public housing block in Sydney’s Waterloo. “He didn’t have to die,” Taite latertold Guardian Australia. “He begged not to die”.In at least one jurisdiction, police admit they are not equipped to deal with the increasing number of mental health callouts they receive.A NSW policeinternal review in 2024 foundthat officers attending mental health incidents are often “an escalating factor” and it would be better if experts were deployed instead. The review found that on average a mental health incident is attended or recorded by police every nine minutes, and this​ had increased each year since 2018.Having mental health challenges or disabilities (seen or unseen) does not warrant the use of forceChloe FragosSo, if even the police (in NSW at least) say they aren’t the right ones to call, what is the alternative?Last month the National Justice Project (NJP) hosted Australia’s first forum on first responders in Sydney. It has launched a campaign for police and social services to implement alternative first responder programs. They say we need a “180-degree shift” that prioritises safety and care over containment and control.Alternative first responders can be community members who are deeply connected to, and understand, the communities they serve. But surrounding these trained responders must be a series of safety supports that allow people scooped out of harm’s way to get the care they need. Where these programs are given a chance to work – and sustainable funding to grow and measure their own effectiveness – they are getting results.In Anindilyakwa (Groote Eylandt in the Northern Territory) the Peacemaker program – where community mediators try to solve problems through negotiation rather than call police – has seen offending drop by about 88% since 2019.In Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia, the Night Place, open seven nights a week, has given hundreds of local kids a hot meal and a safe place to go after dark – and has employed more than 20 local Indigenous staff since it opened in September 2024. Youth crime has fallen significantly over that time,local police told the ABC.Alternative first responders help people get the right care without any need for force. They de-escalate tension and reduce harm. This includes letting people decide what they need and how they receive help.NSW police an ‘escalating factor’ in mental health crisis call outs, internal review findsRead moreIn the United States there are hundreds of community crisis-care groups across more than 130 municipalities implementing non‐police, unarmed emergency responses. The Community Crisis Response Team in Long Beach, California manages calls for mental health distress, suicidal ideation and intoxication with a three-person team of a mental health professional, public health nurse and peer navigator. The goal of the program is to reduce unnecessary police or hospital-based interventions. Crucially, the service does not ask people or collect information about their immigration status.Of course, legislative reforms are needed to embed changes in practice. But NJP campaign lead, Chloe Fragos, says none of this is about going soft on public safety or crime, as much as the rhetoric wants to drive the narrative this way. Having alternative first responders is just common sense.“Firstly, we must address the stigma around mental health and the belief that public safety is somehow at greater risk because of it. This is simply incorrect. Secondly, having mental health challenges or disabilities (seen or unseen) does not warrant the use of force. We do not send police to respond to a heart attack, so why do we send them for mental health callouts?” she says.“We must separate public health and community wellbeing decision-making from the rhetoric of ‘public safety’. What truly keeps communities safe are robust, inclusive and dignified support systems.”What we need is political courage and willingness to invest in community safety that is shaped by, and for, communities themselves. We need law reform, sustainable funding and support for alternative first responders. We need to put an end to the number of families grieving the tragic, avoidable and violent deaths of loved ones who, in their darkest moment needed love and care, but were instead met with lethal force.Explore more on these topicsAustralian police and policingOpinionDeaths in custodyMental healthIndigenous AustraliansLaw (Australia)commentShareReuse this content"

Robbie Millen, chair of judges and the literary editor of the Times, described Garner’s collection as “a remarkable, addictive book,” and said the decision had been unanimous among the six judges. “Garner takes the diary form – mixing the intimate, the intellectual, and the everyday – to new heights.”How To End a Story: Collected Diaries by Helen Garner review – the greatest journals since Virginia Woolf’sRead moreThe Baillie Gifford is widely regarded as the UK’s most prestigious prize for nonfiction. It is the first major literary award Garner has won in the UK, though she is one of Australia’s most celebrated authors, where her honours include the 2023 Australian Society of Authors medal, the 2019 Australia Council award for lifetime achievement in literature, and the 2006 Melbourne prize for literature. She also won the 2016 Windham-Campbell literature prize administered by Yale University.Garner, 82, has long been recognised for her sharp-eyed, often uncompromising examinations of domestic life, creativity and morality. Born in Geelong, southern Australia, in 1942, she worked as a high school teacher and journalist before publishing her debut novel, Monkey Grip, in 1977. She has since written fiction, screenplays and nonfiction, including The Children’s Bach and This House of Grief.How to End a Story collects decades of Garner’s diaries, tracing her life from bohemian Melbourne in the 1970s through an intense love affair in the 1980s to the breakdown of her marriage in the 1990s. The entries are characterised by what the judges called “devastating honesty, steel-sharp wit and an ecstatic attention to the details of everyday life.”Millen praised the breadth and humanity of the diaries, which run to 832 pages. “It’s a big book,” he said, “but Garner is such good company – funny, original, clever, self-lacerating, always interesting – that we didn’t want the story to end.”How to End a Story was published to widespread critical acclaim. Rachel Cookein the Observercalled the diaries “the greatest, richest journals by a writer since Virginia Woolf’s.”Garner’s next work of nonfiction,The Mushroom Tapes: Conversations on a Triple Murder Trial, co-authored with Chloe Hooper and Sarah Krasnostein, will be published in the UK on 20 November, based on the infamous Erin Patterson mushroom murder trial.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Last year, boycotts of literary festivals it had sponsored, organised by the campaign group Fossil Free Books, led to thetermination of partnershipsbetween Baillie Gifford and nine festivals.Last year’s winner, Australian author Richard Flanagan, said he would not accept the £50,000 prize money until the fund manager shared a plan to reduce its investments in fossil fuel extraction and increase investments in renewables. At a press conference held to announce the shortlist, prize director Toby Mundysaid that Flanaganhad had a “candid” conversation with the fund manager, but the ultimate result was that the author did not accept the money and it will instead be donated to a literacy charity.Alongside Garner’s, theother titles shortlistedthis year were The Revolutionists by Jason Burke, The Boundless Deep by Richard Holmes, Captives and Companions by Justin Marozzi, Lone Wolf by Adam Weymouth, and Electric Spark: The Enigma of Muriel Spark by Frances Wilson.The Baillie Gifford was originally founded as the Samuel Johnson prize in 1999. Past winners include Antony Beevor, Jonathan Coe, Serhii Plokhy, Hallie Rubenhold and Katherine Rundell.This year’s judging panel comprised Millen, historian Pratinav Anil, journalist and broadcaster Inaya Folarin Iman, author and previous Baillie Gifford winner Lucy Hughes-Hallett, the Economist’s deputy culture editor Rachel Lloyd, and author and biographer Peter Parker. The panel selected the winner from more than 350 books published between November 2024 and October 2025.To order How to End a Story and browse the shortlist, visitguardianbookshop.com.

But as well as the sounds of war, which continue three and a half years into Russia’s full-scale invasion, music still plays, clubs remain open during the day (closing well before the midnight curfew), and electronic dance music remains an intrinsic part of many Ukrainian lives.Kyiv’s iconic clubs,such as K41, became bomb shelters before transforming into frontline fundraisers. Parties doubling up ascleanup operationsare held at strike sites. New venues such asAbo Records– the first of many creative spaces to set up shop in an abandoned liquor factory – have emerged as gathering points where you might share a cigarette with a sniper or combat medic as easily as with a DJ. But the rehabilitative power of dance music is most evident at the Superhumans centre, near Lviv in the west of Ukraine. Here, the most critically war-wounded are treated with prosthetics and reconstructive surgery, and psychological support is given to children and adults affected by the war. And within the range of treatment is music therapy.Howard Buffett, the son of Warren Buffett and one of the centre’s chief funders, suggested forming a Superhumans band, so the centre teamed up with music charityVictory Beats, which was set up one year into the war to provide veterans with relaxation and a nonverbal outlet for emotional expression.“We were working with a 25-year-old soldier with severe brain damage and limited use of his hand,” the charity’s founder, Volodymyr Nedohoda, remembers. “We started with a [sound-based] relaxation session designed to calm the nervous system, but stopped almost immediately because the low frequency triggered pain. When he started to feel better, he asked for a DJ console.”If I go two days without playing music, that’s when the phantom pains and bad thoughts startRoman CherkasHaving witnessed the efficacy of electronic music as therapy firsthand, Negodada and Vlad Fisun – a DJ and former editor-in-chief of Playboy Ukraine – partnered to create theEnterDJprogramme, which teaches veterans the basics of mixing. All that users require is a laptop, headphones and an internet connection; some tune in from home, others show up to a dedicated space in the Superhumans centre. “Immersed completely in the process, playing track by track without paying attention to low or high frequencies, the soldier started to use his injured hand,” Negodada says. The patient remained with EnterDJ for the duration of his stay at Superhumans, and Negodada saw him perform a DJ set a year later: “He still has health issues but remains passionate about DJing.”Speaking with the same stoicism that underpins most of my conversations with Ukrainians, another veteran, Oleksandr, tells me about the incident that led him to Superhumans and EnterDJ. “I was serving in Poltava when a missile destroyed my leg,” he says. “I remember everything about it. The blast, phoning my commander to say I was alive, realising I’d have to drive an automatic car, worrying about the blood in my car after the evacuation.” He laughs at the absurdity, and continues. “In hospital, I lost nearly all my blood and had to be resuscitated. I woke up knowing my leg was gone, but thankful the rest of my body and brain were OK. That’s most important.”View image in fullscreenOleksandr Ivanko performing.Photograph: Solomia GavrylyakFor Oleksandr, EnterDJ became a daily routine, “to get some good moments if the day was hard, or to celebrate if I gained something in rehabilitation”. Within six months, he was performing alongside the Lviv Philharmonic Orchestra, using a Midi controller to layer sounds over a composition written with British composer Nigel Osborne.Oleksandr had started off using singing bowls in a sound therapy session. “Then I saw the DJ console and it reminded me of my school days, trying to mix music on a laptop.” Before being fitted with a prosthetic leg, EnterDJ “helped distract me from the trauma and rehabbing”, he says, holding his kind gaze steady. “I now listen more deeply, breaking music into parts for mixing, and even composing. We have composed ambient music for therapeutic purposes; I added electronic effects to live classical instruments. The audience relaxed deeply; some even fell asleep. So we met our goal!” Most recently, Oleksandr played for Prince Harry on a visit to Kyiv.EnterDJ’s students are encouraged to find their own DJ style. They are able to pull tracks from a catalogue of music donated by record labels across the world, including Lyon’s Hard Fist, Sao Paulo’s Tropicana, and Lisbon’s Disco Extendes, as well as Ukrainian labels such as Mystictrax, 2064, Regulardisco, and Trance Pandemic.Roman Cherkas, who served in the Third Tank brigade in eastern Ukraine, has gravitated towards drum’n’bass. He joined the EnterDJ programme after months of surgeries, prosthetics and rehabilitation at the centre, after losing both of his lower limbs in a mortar strike. He speaks to me on a call from his home, ready with a drum’n’bass mix. “Right now, I still don’t feel mobile, I can’t move around normally. Music has become energy for me, life energy,” he says. “If I go two days without listening or playing, that’s when the phantom pains, bad thoughts, and even depression start. For me, music is a normal task, my remedy.”After six months in the programme, Roman performed in Lviv at a showcase by one of the world’s leading drum’n’bass labels, Hospital Records. He speaks slowly and thoughtfully about how music shifts his headspace. He becomes completely absorbed by it, sometimes sitting in his chair mixing for six-hour stretches. “I tried working with psychologists but it didn’t work for me. You have to consciously switch your brain on and imagine lifting your legs, which is very difficult. With music, it’s the opposite, it switches my mind automatically and makes me feel better.”View image in fullscreenRoman Cherkas performs live.Photograph: Yury StefanyakOlga Rudneva, chief executive of Superhumans, is proud of how veterans who pass through Superhumans are performing on big stages, but underlines what she finds most important about the program: “Positive healing effects for patients; reduced phantom pain; positive mood and more socialisation.”However, the EnterDJ programme is used not just by injured veterans but by children and adults across Ukraine, and its creators highlight its broader power. Chief executive Yevhen Skrypnyk introduced techno to his hometown of Sloviansk in eastern Donbas with Shum Rave(“shum” meaning noise in Ukrainian), a party with the purpose to rebuild the city and its culture after liberation from Russian occupation back in 2014. “We all grew up too early,” he says. “We know what it means for a friend to die in the war, or what it means to wait for your friend in captivity. I’ve been in the events industry for more than 10 years, but it was never just about the party; it’s about how we could connect people and destroy stereotypes. In Ukraine, we are fighting for our lives, and for our culture.”Andreas Boesch, partnership curator at EnterDJ, agrees, saying that music and culture are the best means Ukraine has to fight against Russian propaganda. “It’s an international language, it can be understood everywhere, by everyone. You can try and convince people of everything that’s happening here, but it’s hard to touch them in a big way because they’re so far away and it can be difficult to understand. But with music, you can pass on greatness.”Explore more on these topicsElectronic musicDance musicUkraineEuropeRussiaHealthHospitalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have allocated £285,000 in funding since starting out.View image in fullscreenAssembly member Rudy, 70, a volunteer support worker, making a point at a progress report meeting.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian“Without citizens and community around the table shaping the direction and showing the horizon, we would quickly become an average organisation,” says Saad Eddine Said, chief executive and artistic director at NAE, which is the UK’s largest gallery dedicated to African, Caribbean and south Asian artists.“This neighbourhood is such a huge treasure of culture and of talent so we wanted it to play a key role, not just in terms of consultancy, but in real terms of coleadership.”A street gallery outside the building, designed to entice people in, was removed after assembly members said it was intimidating and off-putting, and more money was invested in making the cafe a welcoming space that would bring people through the door instead.After reporting that a major problem in the area was a lack of places to socialise on a Friday evening, NAE started hosting socials, such as poetry and DJ events, which draw large crowds.“We believe in [the assembly] and we don’t want it to become just a trendy thing, just ticking boxes,” says Said. “Removing the street gallery felt counterintuitive to us. But straight away that street gallery was in the bin, and in the bin for ever.View image in fullscreenThe cafe area at the New Art Exchange. The citizens’ assembly made the cafe a welcoming space that would bring people through the door.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian“It didn’t matter whether we understood it. There is no compromise in that conversation.”Adam Roe, the gallery’s executive director, says: “I’ve been asked: ‘Do you think that you’ve lost power as a result of this?’“Actually, I think I’ve gained power. Collectively, we’ve got so much more knowledge because we’re doing the things we know we need to do.“And some of the artists and the performers we work with now we probably would never have known about before.”Citizens’ assemblies have long been used in local democracy and public policy to gauge national opinion, but in recent years they have spread into other sectors – and cultural institutions are the latest to try using them.In August, the National Gallery announced it was creating a citizens’ assembly of 50 people from across the UK who will make recommendations that will be built on by a smaller citizens’ panel over the next five years.Birmingham Museum &ArtGallery recruited a citizens’ jury in 2024 which published several recommendations, including later opening times and promoting the work of young people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So for me, it has been a real boost. I feel invigorated by being part of this process.”Said says the assembly was “hugely expensive and time consuming” to set up, but has had a drastically positive impact – overall engagement at NAE is up 22% and the number of visitors from global ethnic majority backgrounds has grown by 48%.He has nowdeveloped a blueprintfor other organisations to implement citizens’ assemblies in a similar way.“It has helped us navigate one of the most challenging times for the cultural and art industry in a very long time – just look at how many organisations are closing down,” he says. “Our citizens make us relevant.”* Not her real nameExplore more on these topicsArtNottinghamMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I assumed that there was some sort of baseline, some inescapable bedrock knowledge of how to do it that now prevents any entry into the art form from falling below a certain standard. But I was wrong. The new series from Ryan Murphy, All’s Fair – starringKim Kardashian, Naomi Watts and Niecy Nash as the founders of an all-female law firm delivering divorce-y justice to incredibly rich but slightly unlucky women under the azure skies of California – is terrible. Fascinatingly, incomprehensibly, existentially terrible. While I try to get my thoughts in order after bearing witness to the first episode, I’m going to give you a few direct quotes, so you can see why I’m struggling.“Let’s put the ‘team’ in ‘teamwork’.”“My flight was turbulent and so is my mood,” says Liberty (Watts) to a man barring her way to a client.“He’s wolf-like in his possessiveness,” says a client of her husband.It’ssoawful, it feels almost contemptuous.‘I wanted to scrape it from my eyeballs’: critics on their zero-star savagingsRead moreI looked for Julian Fellowes’ name in the credits, but apparently this is all the responsibility of Murphy and his co-creators, Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken.They are also executive producers, along with Kim K, her mother Kris Jenner, Watts, Glenn Close (who also has a small role as the protagonists’ early mentor – I cannot imagine what kompromat the Kardashian clan have on her that led to her participation in this dreadful business), Nash and many, many more. The list goes on for ages. I suspect a variation of the bystander effect (whereby the more witnesses there are to a mugging – for example – the less likely any one is to intervene) is in operation. Thus, the more exec producers linked to it, the worse the show.View image in fullscreenSo awful it feels almost contemptuous … Niecy Nash, Glenn Close and Kim Kardashian in All’s Fair.Photograph: Ser Baffo/DisneyStill, there’s worse and then there’s All’s Fair. Beyond the embarrassment of the script, there is the embarrassment of the performances; although I take the point that when someone – in this case, Murphy stalwart Sarah Paulson as psychopathic rival “lady” lawyer Carrington – is required to scream “Are you calling me an ugly duckling? So what if I give myself home perms? It’s economical!”, while smashing up her mentor’s office, they are probably not going to be able to give their best.View image in fullscreen‘Beyond the embarrassment of the script, there is the embarrassment of the performances’ … Kim Kardashian and Naomi Watts in All’s Fair.Photograph: Ser Baffo/DisneyKim K as Allura, married to a football star who is resentful of the shadow cast over his own success by hers, is as expressionless as you might expect, but is at least inoffensively useless. Watts preens and pouts and poses in search of a character, and reminds you of nothing so much asAlly McBeal at her very worst, delivering her lines so archly that you can almost hear her joints cracking. The guest stars are worse. Nash – an unstoppable onscreen force – fares better in a role where the comic intent suits her well. But how parts for Black women are still being written as nothing more than Loud! And Sassy! I do not know. The one good thingAnd Just Like That …ever did was seem to be the nail in that coffin. But All’s Fair makes it look like Heimat.View image in fullscreenDo not even be tempted to watch … Kim Kardashian in All’s Fair.Photograph: Ser Baffo/DisneyIf this was all part of a lurid, camp drama played with gusto by all and narratively stuffed with treats, Murphy might have got away with it. But no one seems to know what they’re doing; the performances seem to respond to about nine different ideas of what the show is and the plots are dismal. The trio (“You’re the best divorce lawyers in town – maybe the country”) wrap up multiple cases in the time it takes Kim K’s nail varnish to dry. There’s the younger wife who falls in love with the woman her husband hires for a threesome, then walks off 10 minutes later with a $210m settlement once Nash acquires video evidence of his extensive perversions. (“Sow teats” is all I’m prepared to say here. Do not let this tempt you into watching.)View image in fullscreenIts concept of female empowerment would have shamed the Spice Girls 30 years ago … Kim Kardashian and Niecy Nash in All’s Fair.Photograph: Ser Baffo/DisneyThere’s the older wife caught cheating (“He wasn’t even attractive! He just looked at me the way you used to look at me!”) and about to be thrown out of the New York marital home by her billionaire husband (“The guy who, like, owns all of cosmetics”) until Liberty flies out on the private jet to tell her she can take the $40m worth of jewellery she owns with her. These are fitted in around a couple of the worst kissing scenes ever seen on screen, the collapse of Allura’s marriage, a jarringly unfashionable obsession with brand names (“Let’s get those Goyard travel cases and start stuffing!”) and conspicuous consumption (“Oh my God – didn’t this belong to Elizabeth Taylor?”). All this, and a concept of female empowerment (“I settled … Did I not love myself enough?”) that would have shamed the Spice Girls 30 years ago.So bad it’s not good. Nowhere near.All’s Fair is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewKim KardashianGlenn CloseNaomi WattsreviewsShareReuse this content"

So why are they so terrifying?Jonathan JonesTue 4 Nov 2025 12.22 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 15.24 ESTShareHe looks like he’s up to no good. In the depths of the night, under trees and clouds turned silver and black by the full moon, a man is at work with a shovel. Is he burying a body or digging bits up for a Frankensteinian experiment? After all, this painting was done by Joseph Wright of Derby, a friend of pioneering scientists and industrialists in the Lunar Society of Birmingham, leaders of the new science that would inspire Mary Shelley.But the man beside the foaming river Derwent is not collecting body parts. He’s doing something just as nefarious by 21st-century moral standards: blocking a fox den so the foxes can’t get back in and will be easy game for the hunt tomorrow. Maybe Wright shares my compassion for foxes, because An Earthstopper on the Banks of the Derwent genuinely is a bit sinister. Yet it has a hypnotic beauty. Two light sources – a lantern and the moon – make this night anything but dead as we almost hear leaves rustle, white water rush and the earthstopper’s spade clunk. It’s one thing to paint a landscape by day. Wright makes one come fantastically alive by night.The National Gallery’s close look at Wright’s paintings of darkness and illumination reveals him as the first gothic artist. The gothic novel was invented when Horace Walpole published The Castle of Otranto in 1764; Wright painted his journeys into the horrors of the night in the 1760s and 70s. But the bloodcurdling secret at the heart of these paintings is scientific not supernatural.View image in fullscreenBloodcurdling secrets … Earthstopper on the Banks of the Derwent, 1773, by Joseph Wright of Derby.Photograph: © Derby MuseumsInA Philosopher by Lamplight, two young travellers have found more than they bargained for. Stumbling over a moonlit stream to a cave lit by a lonely candle, they look in terror upon an old man playing with a skeleton, lifting a bony leg as its skull stares from hollow eyes. The hermit is a philosopher trying to puzzle out what happens when we die. But the answer is nothing. For as science took hold in 18th-century Europe as a way of rationally understanding nature, God might be dead, according to radical minds like Wright of Derby’s friend Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles.InThe Blacksmith’s Shop, the glowing metal on which the blacksmith is working lights up a ruinous building: the workshop is inside a classical temple with Corinthian pilasters. This is an unmistakable reference to Renaissance paintings of the nativity where the stable is often a dilapidated Roman temple, symbolising the death of paganism and rise of Christianity. What can it represent here except the modern material world being born in turn from Christianity’s wreckage?Open your eyes to the nature of the universe, the true magic of science, urges this artist of Enlightenment in his spectacular canvasA Philosopher Giving That Lecture on the Orrery in which a Lamp Is Put in Place of the Sun. The National Gallery provides a real orrery, a mechanical model of the solar system, for comparison.View image in fullscreenDifferent scales … A Philosopher Giving That Lecture on the Orrery in Which a Lamp Is Put in Place of the Sun, 1764-1766, by Joseph Wright of Derby.Photograph: Joseph Wright of Derby/© Derby MuseumsOne reason Wright’s painted orrery is so bewitching is that you see it at different scales from the perspectives of the audience gathered round the model in a shadowy library. Go close to the enthralled faces of the children and it seems vast; stand further back and it’s a scientific toy, small compared with the lecturer and the gentleman beside him who assiduously takes notes. The scientist looks at him sceptically; a woman in a hat and jewels seems a little blank-eyed. Compared with the children, these adults are less electrified by curiosity.Maybe shock tactics are needed. Wright’s Orrery, like other paintings here from the superb collection of his work at Derby Museum, is reunited with his other great science spectacle, the National Gallery’sAn Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump.Painted two years after his Orrery, it shifts the focus from wonder to dread. One girl hides her face, too appalled to look – for the lecturer is about to create a vacuum in a glass chamber, killing the white cockatoo inside.Wright gives this experiment hard-edged reality. It’s the summit of his use of light cutting through darkness to define objects and spaces. The machine at the heart of the action is a formidable structure, its wooden column and brass fittings suggesting the steam engines being perfected by Lunar Society members. In the immortal words of the society’s co-founder Matthew Boulton: “I sell here, Sir, what all the world desires to have: power!”The audience in Wright’s painting includes members of the local gentry in a Georgian country house, but the power is not in their hands. It is a new kind of power possessed by the scientist. This 18th-century Oppenheimer gazes at us as he prepares to crank the handle, kill the bird, detonate the bomb. Wright isn’t rejecting science but intuiting that it will change these people’s world – and ours – as surely as that bird will die. Candlelight from behind fills a glass vessel with liquid light as if it were radioactive, illuminating a human skull. This is meant to be a rational exposition of the vacuum, but has become a nightmarish theatre of science, power, cruelty and death. Perhaps the youngest girl, who can’t take her eyes from the horror, is plotting a gothic novel of her own.Wright of Derby: From the Shadows is atthe National Gallery, London, from 7 November to 10 MayExplore more on these topicsArtNational GalleryreviewsShareReuse this content"

She brought an authentic, undiluted American screen-acting flavour to everything she was in, and ran hugely successful movie and TV careers in parallel for decades, playing waitresses, neighbours, moms, sirens and daughters, and ranging from comedy to drama.She was famously the mother of screen actor Laura Dern and wife of Bruce Dern, and repeatedly acted with Laura in a remarkable mother-daughter partnership in which the two women’s closeness always shone through. You might compare it to Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli, or Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher — although Diane Ladd and Laura Dern were far more trouble-free and without that kind of angst. They were Oscar-nominated together for their joint appearance in Martha Coolidge’s Depression drama Rambling Rose from 1991. And they also both appeared in David Lynch’s Wild at Heart and Inland Empire, Alexander Payne’s Citizen Ruth, and in Mike White’s HBO drama Enlightened – and in three of these they played, naturally, a mother and daughter. In Joel Hershman’s 1992 comedy Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Ladd acted alongside her own mother, the stage actor Mary Lanier.View image in fullscreenMother-daughter partnership … Ladd (left) with Laura Dern in Rambling Rose.Photograph: Carolco/Rambling Rose/Midnight Sun/Kobal/ShutterstockShe had a minor but potent, mysterious part in Polanski’s Chinatown as Ida Sessions, the woman who has posed as Faye Dunaway’s character Evelyn as part of a sinister conspiracy. But more prominent was her role in the classic and time-honoured role as the brassy, heart-of-gold diner waitress in Martin Scorsese’s Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore – playing a slightly different part in the TV spinoff – whose job is to deliver down-home banter and hard-won unimpressed wisdom with Ellen Burstyn’s Alice and to be the witness of the latter’s budding romance with Kris Kristofferson. In Bill Duke’s silver-years comedy The Cemetery Club from 1993, Ladd was reunited with Ellen Burstyn and Olympia Dukakis, to play one of three widowed women who are determined to get some enjoyment out of life.But it was perhaps Ladd’s destiny to play more in an intergenerational context, portraying older characters and mothers and sisters, in various comic or forbidding forms. In Bob Rafelson’s Black Widow she was the sister of one of the murderer’s black-widow predations; in National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation she was Chevy Chase’s mom; and in Mike Nichols’ Primary Colors she was the mother of John Travolta’s Clintonesque Governor Jack Stanton.View image in fullscreenLadd in Wild at Heart.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyDavid Lynch tapped into the sharpness, the astringency and the darkness within or behind the all-American veneer that Ladd could present to the camera. In Wild at Heart (opposite Laura Dern), she got one of her three Oscar nominations in the very sensual role of Marietta, who conceives a sexually ambiguous resentment against her daughter’s association with the smouldering Sailor (Nicolas Cage) and tries different ways to sabotage their relationship and murder him. In Lynch’s far more complex and experimental Inland Empire, again of course with Dern, she plays the host of a TV celebrity gossip show which is very preoccupied with Dern’s actor character: again, Ladd is vivid, cartoony, but not satirical or grotesque; she is an effortlessly Lynchian character.Explore more on these topicsFilmLaura DernDavid LynchMartin ScorsesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a result, he’s been given a soapbox … which he shows no sign of climbing down from. Any time he wants to talk about it, I’m easy to find.“If I thought during our work together I’d interfered with his working process, I’d be appalled. But I don’t think it was like that. So I don’t know where the fuck that came from.Jeremy Strongis a very fine actor, I don’t know how he goes about things, but I don’t feel responsible in any way for that.”‘Theatre is an elitist artform for privileged people’: Daniel Day-Lewis talks class, cinema and his crush on Mary PoppinsRead moreDay-Lewis’s unhappiness with the representation of method acting – whereby an actor immerses themselves in their character both on and off set – has become apparent on the press tour for his new film,Anemone.He has addressed the issue in most, if not all, of his recent interviews.Appearing at the BFI Southbank last month, Day-Lewis said “recent commentary” about the technique “is invariably from people who have little or no understanding of what it actually involves. It’s almost as if it’s some specious science that we’re involved in, or a cult.”He told the Big Issue: “I can’t think of a single commentator who’s gobbed off about the method that has any understanding of how it works and the intention behind it.“They focus on, ‘Oh, he lived in a jail cell for six months’ [for 1993 film In the Name of the Father]. Those are the least important details. In all the performing arts, people find their methods as a means to an end. It’s with the intention of freeing yourself so you present your colleagues with a living, breathing human being they can interact with. It’s very simple.“So it pisses me off this whole, ‘Oh, he went full method,’ thing … Because it’s invariably attached to the idea of some kind of lunacy.”Day-Lewis went on to contrast his own on-set professionalism with that of some of his colleagues, who instead spend their time playing pranks.“I choose to stay and splash around,” said Day-Lewis, “rather than jump in and out or play practical jokes with whoopee cushions between takes or whatever people think is how you should behave as an actor.”Anemone, the directorial debut of Ronan Day-Lewis, who co-wrote it with his father, opens in the UK on 7 November.Explore more on these topicsDaniel Day-LewisBrian CoxActingJeremy StrongSuccessionnewsShareReuse this content"

The first collapse took place at about 10.30am UK time, the second about 90 minutes later.Clouds of dust billowed out of the windows, along with the sound of collapsing masonry. The second collapse happened while firefighters worked on the structure with aerial ladders. None of the firefighters were injured.“The rescue operation took a long time because every time a part of the worker’s body was freed, further collapses occurred, burying him again under the rubble,” Rome’s police chief, Lamberto Giannini said, soon after Stroici was freed.Authorities said he was conscious during the lengthy rescue operation before he was hospitalised in critical condition. He died shortly after he arrived at the hospital.A second worker, also Romanian, was pulled out almost immediately and taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening head injuries, while two more workers suffered minor injuries and declined hospital treatment.1:06Moment part of medieval tower in Rome collapses – videoWitnesses reported hearing a loud bang and seeing clouds of dust. One told Corriere della Sera: “I saw a worker fall.”Firefighters flew a drone through a window to inspect the site.One worker inside at the time of the first collapse said he escaped from a balcony. “It was not safe. I just want to go home,” said the man, white dust covering his uniform, who gave his name as Ottaviano and his age as 67.Elena, from the UK, who like others did not want to give her last name, works at Shamrock, a pub with views of the tower from its outside seating area. She said she had been preparing to open the pub when the first collapse happened.“It felt a bit like an earthquake,” she said. “I saw a man trying to get out by walking down the scaffolding – I didn’t realise people were inside working on it.”Sue and Don, a couple from the UK, had been eating breakfast at a restaurant in front of the monument earlier in the morning when they heard loud drilling. “It seemed they were drilling deeply into the building and we wondered what they could be doing,” Sue said.Caterina, who was born in the Italian capital, was among the large crowd of onlookers gathered at the scene. “I have never experienced anything like this in central Rome before,” she said.Queen Paglinawan was working in a nearby gelato shop when she heard two loud noises in quick succession. “I was working and then I heard some like falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,” said Paglinawan, 27, as yet another collapse occurred in the background.Viktoria Braeu, a student from Germany, passed by the scene just as the collapse during the firefighters’ rescue happened. “We were just at the Colosseum … and we were just walking to get some food. And then we were like: ‘It’s probably not long until it’s going to go down,’ and then it just started erupting,” said Braeu, 18.The area of the Forum and Piazza Venezia, which is continuously packed with tourists and traffic, was cordoned off. The mayor of Rome, Roberto Gualtieri, and Italy’s culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, were at the scene.The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Richard Conti, brother ofPope Innocent III, as a fortified residence for his family. It was damaged in an earthquake in 1349 and there were collapses in the 17th century.The restoration works are being financed by funds from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery fund in order to make the building more secure.Agence France-Presse, Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Nothing is more outdated than the 2025 John Lewis Christmas advertA child going into an actual shop and buying a vinyl record? It will make you feel old and decrepit, and it’ll utterly bamboozle young people … but shut up – it’s Christmas!Stuart HeritageTue 4 Nov 2025 02.41 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 12.13 ESTShareThe weird thing about tradition is that it has a tendency to long outlive its usefulness. Bonfire Night, once a way for the government to remind the public of its capacity to murder revolutionaries, has simply become an excuse to eat a jacket potato in a field. Church bells still ring on Sunday mornings, when it would be quicker and way more considerate to ping the congregation on WhatsApp. And the John Lewis Christmas advert is somehow still a thing.True, it wasn’t so long ago that the John Lewis Christmas advert was a cultural institution; a teargas grenade lobbed into the television schedules to make viewers cry in the middle of The Cube. But now it is the year 2025, and things have changed. The John Lewis advert is a linear television commercial about a department store, even though the only way to describe either of those two things to a child is as a YouTube with no search function and an Amazon you actually have to walk to.Nevertheless, this year’s John Lewis Christmas advert has landed – 10 days earlier than last year – and it is absolutely business as usual. A boy buys his dad a vinyl copy of the house banger Where Love Lives by Alison Limerick. The record causes the dad to be transported to a dancefloor, where his son greets him as a baby, a toddler, and finally as an adolescent. And then, through the sheer power of John Lewis, the song slows down into a sludgy plink-plonk cover version of itself.In other words, this is the mashup between Love Actually and Aftersun nobody knew they needed. In the former, you will remember that Alan Rickman gifted his wife Emma Thompson a Joni Mitchell CD, an act that moved her to tears. In the latter, you will remember that a father and his daughter dance euphorically to Under Pressure.2:07Watch the 2025 John Lewis Christmas advert – videoOh, sure, you could read more into those references if you wanted. You could suggest that the scene in Aftersun represented the very last moment father and daughter spent together before he abandons her forever, causing her a lifetime of unsolvable trauma. And maybe you’d want to point out that Emma Thompson was actually crying because the CD was confirmation that Alan Rickman was cheating on her and their marriage was over. But shut up, it’s Christmas.Either way, what’s clever about the advert is that fathers and sons will each take something different from it. The fact that the son bought such a thoughtful present is a sign that he realises his dad was once an actual person with his own desires and interests who didn’t just exist to be in service of his family. It’s a profound moment for a child, and one that cannot help but change the nature of the relationship.View image in fullscreenA dad is transported back to a dance floor with his toddler … it can only be the 2025 John Lewis Christmas advert.Photograph: John Lewis/PAMeanwhile, the advert perfectly captures a very common moment of fatherhood. I’m talking, of course, about the time you decide to go clubbing, only to realise that since having a child you’ve become horrifically old and decrepit and that, to all the young people around you, you now basically represent the creeping spectre of death, and you’re suddenly hit by the realisation of how ancient you are, and you go home depressed and never attempt anything fun or exciting again until you die.And then anyone under the age of 20 will take something else from the advert. That is: what the hell does any of this mean? It’s a film about someone buying a vinyl record from a bricks and mortar shop, that’s being shown on linear broadcast television? Why? Why go to all this bother? Why doesn’t the son just play him the song on Spotify? Why doesn’t he type ‘Where Love Lives’ into TikTok and give his dad the gift of an algorithmically generated feed of some Russian children lip-syncing to it? Wouldn’t that be easier?Honestly, to Gen Z or younger, this whole thing must be like watching a highly commended entry from an obsolete technology competition. You know what? Next year, why not go even further? Why not release the John Lewis advert as a phénakisticope about a farmer trading a goat for a sack of stubble turnips? It couldn’t possibly be any more of an anachronism than this.But maybe I’m being cynical. There’s still a romance to clinging on to traditions that are no longer useful. A tangible record will always be more special than an online stream. Visiting a shop will always be more special than clicking an object on a website. There’s something reassuring in the way that we’re still discussing a television commercial. And we’re doing it via the medium of print journalism, the most obsolescent technology of them all. Merry Christmas everyone!This article was amended on 4 November 2025 to remove a suggestion that print journalism is “obsolete”.Newspapers and magazines are still available.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionJohn Lewis Christmas adfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How can this rot be real? If I recreated the idea in my local park, I’d surely end up in prisonHannah J DaviesTue 4 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 03.01 ESTShareThere’s missing the point, and then there’s Netflix making its capitalism-skewing Korean hit about a ruthless contest intoan actual gameshow.The producers of Squid Game: The Challenge have previouslydenied that’s what happened here, stating that, in fact, the series is also about camaraderie and how people work under pressure, and is, I quote, “a critique of how we are ingrained from childhood to be ultra-competitive”. Come on – it’s a reality show about people doing humiliating things because they’re desperate for money, based on a drama about people doing humiliating things because they’re desperate for money. If I rounded up a load of debt-ridden people and recreated Squid Game: The Challenge in my local park, I’m pretty sure I’d be put in prison.The thing about Squid Game: The Challenge that makes it all OK (although really, none of it is OK) is that everyone here is completely mesmerised by the amount of money on offer. Its prize is among the largest in gameshow history, with the winner of series one, Mai Whelan, cashing a cheque for an extremely cool $4.56m (£3.47m). It’s the sort of money that makes people go gaga from the off, and the treachery is off the charts.For series two, they’ve made it meaner than ever, with the twists coming in thicker and faster and the sob stories more abject. If there was a brief moment in series one where it felt as if maybe this whole “critique” thing was, perhaps, not a clear bid to have one’s cake and eat it, that moment has definitely passed.The undoubted stars of this first batch of episodes (Netflix will release another lot on 11 November, before the finale on the 18th) are British twins and TikTok personalities Jacob and Raul Gibson. The Gibsons, AKA players 431 and 432, are charming schemers who have the other betracksuited competitors under their spell during a challenge to count 456 seconds exactly – that is, until they eliminate three other players to keep themselves in the game. People are outraged as the losers fall to the ground in mock-death but, well, there’s $4.56m dollars on the line here, guys!View image in fullscreenNever has a fun pastime been so unpleasant to watch … Squid Game: The Challenge.Photograph: NetflixLike The Traitors – which is made by the same production company, Studio Lambert – Squid Game: The Challenge has a dark campiness to it (at a pivotal moment in episode one, Nina Simone’s Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood plays, cocking a snook at the players’ differing tactics and opinions). But unlike The Traitors, Squid Game: The Challenge doesn’t always feel like fun. Sure, watching someone assemble a house of cards should be low-stakes enough. But when that person is physically shaking, sweat pouring off their face like water running from a tap, while their team’s chances of staying in the game are on the line? Not so much. Never has catching a ball in a cup been so urgent – or so unpleasant to watch.Perhaps, as viewers, we’re supposed to find the “critique” in just how quickly players turn on one another, using words like “dorky” and, er, “fraudalent” to describe each other, and judging who should stay or go based on what they would use the prize money for (leukaemia research – good! Yacht party – bad!). People say things like “it’s just a game” while gritting their teeth in a way that says “this is very muchnotjust a game”. There is the occasional air of theStanford Prison Experiment, and seeing how quickly power corrupts.But I feel all of this is giving Squid Game: The Challenge far too much credit. The last episode of this batch, Mingle, is particularly grim, and is based on a game from the original drama that was described as one of its most brutal and upsetting. At the very least, it will be very triggering for anyone who was ever picked last in PE.For a brief moment, I do consider whether Squid Game: The Challenge could be so bad that it is good, but I think that would be letting its makers off too lightly. The way many of its contestants conduct themselves is dreadful, but then again, this is a dreadful contest. Still, I don’t blame the people who signed up to win $4.56m. Don’t hate the player – hate the utterly grotty game.Squid Game: The Challenge is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewSquid GameGame showsTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then the strain began to showTue 4 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 11.40 ESTShareThere aren’t many people who understand the stress that the celebrity Traitors Cat Burns and Alan Carr have been feeling as their stintwearing that famous green cloakdraws to an end – but I do. I spent four weeks lying, cheating and murdering friends and colleagues in our office version of The Traitors.I almost lost my mind.Everyone watches The Traitors and sees the contestants, Traitors and Faithfuls alike, act irrationally and make poor decisions and thinks: “That wouldn’t be me. I’d be rational. I wouldn’t beLinda from series three, immediately giving the game away. I’d be Harry from series two,emotionally manipulatinga girl with a colostomy bag.”Reader, I was once like you. I was so certain of my rationality that on New Year’s Day Itweeted my confidenceI would be “extremely normal” if I were ever on the show.Little did I know that one of my colleagues was donning metaphorical eyeliner and fringe to act as Claudia Winkleman. Just a week later, I received a Slack explaining that three of my colleagues and I had been selected as Traitors in a game in my office. I’m not sure why God chose this example to teach me a lesson about being careful what you wish for. Or was it about pride? I’m just glad the stakes were so low. And maybe his message should have been clearer.The rules were simple. Everyone in the office had been made either a Faithful or a Traitor. In the morning, the Traitors’ latest victim would be announced on Slack. In the evening, we’d vote on who we wanted to banish. If there were any Traitors left at the end of the game, the Traitors would win the grand prize, a day of annual leave. On paper, it all seems like a low-stakes team-building exercise. No one was competing so they could afford a bionic hand, asNicky did in season one. And I’m sure the colleague who donned the metaphorical eyeliner as our Claudia didn’t intend to induceMcCarthy-level paranoiain me. But she did.I left the Slack channel we were in at once. The idea of forming a brand-new group called “Project costs”, with four people from entirely different parts of the business, seemed too suspicious to me. We moved to a WhatsApp group, our digital turret. It was easier than trying to have hooded meetings in the supply cupboard after work.We called the group “Nan’s birthday” so that it could be open on our work laptops without attracting suspicion. To make it seem more authentic, I made the group photo an actual photo of my nanna at her 90th birthday. Only when I’d saved my fellow Traitors’ numbers under fake names was I happy that the digital level of OpSec was high enough.In person, it was a different story. We were subjected to a 24/7, cross-platform interrogation. WhatsApps, pitch meetings, client lunches – all became accusatory terrain. Lying became second nature. I lied to colleagues as I warmed up my lunch in the microwave, I lied at work drinks, I even lied to my manager who worked in a different office, and wasn’t even playing the game.I spoke about almost nothing else. I’d wake my girlfriend up, boring her stupid about what Faithfuls had which theories, and who had nearly been caught, and who we were going to murder next. I dreamed about it.There was a farcical moment where I discussed the game with some colleagues on my PoliticsJOE podcast. Through gritted teeth, I claimed to be a Faithful. Now I wasn’t just lying to people I knew. Ifelt like Richard Nixon.On the way up to Manchester with two Faithful colleagues, we didn’t talk about anything apart from who we thought were Traitors and Faithfuls. We turned the spotlight on one another, each subjected to about 45 minutes of scrutiny. After my turn, my colleagues looked at each other.“You’d have to be some sort of psychopath to be able to lie like that,” one said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He discusses the importance of curiosity, frugality and 10-11 hours sleep a nightAngelique ChrisafisTue 4 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 02.31 ESTShareBeing a TV general-knowledge quiz champion is a funny kind of fame, because random strangers want to test you on all sorts of trivia. “Sometimes I’ll be walking down the street, a car slows, the window goes down and someone screams: ‘Capital of Brunei?’ I answer and they drive off – it’s amusing really,” says Émilien, a 22-year-old history student who this summer became not only the most successful French gameshow contestant of all time, but the biggest gameshow winner in European history and the world record-holder for the most solo consecutive appearances on a TV quizshow.And everyone, of course, wants to know how he did it.Émilien, known only by his first name, bounded on to France’s popular general knowledge quizshow,Les Douze Coups de Midi(The Twelve Strokes of Noon) in September 2023 – wearing odd socks for good luck – with only one aim: to reach the next round.“What did the American aerospace engineer Edward Murphy give his name to?” washis first question. “Murphy’s law”, he replied, explaining about toast inevitably falling butter-side down. The show’s format means that each day’s winner can return the next day to compete again. Émilien kept winning – on topics ranging from 16th-century painting to French nuclear power stations, ice-skating partnerships to Greek myths, French rap to cocktail recipes. No other contestants could beat him. He returned day after day for an astonishing 647 consecutive appearances, over nearly two years.His run ended in July after 21 months – in a 60-second, timed round, he fell down on questions including “What Breton football club is going up into Ligue 1 next season?” But by then he was a household name. He had boosted audience ratings to more than 7 million and sparked a rush of interest in general knowledge among young people. His daily appearances had become a rare force for stability in a nation inpolitical crisis: while he was on the show, France burned through four prime ministers.We meet at his modest, sparsely furnished flat on an unassuming street on the outskirts of Toulouse. He had been studying for a history degree here that he had to pause because of the punishing quizshow shooting schedule. Only a very shiny new toaster on the kitchen counter, which looks conspicuously like a prize, hints at his fame. You would never guess he has been handed a giant cardboard cheque for more than €2.5m (£2.2m) – a rollover of almost two years’ worth of prizes that made him France’s first quizshow multimillionaire.When he first appeared on the show he was 20 and had passed his driving test in a borrowed car less than two weeks before. Within a week, he’d won a Ford Fiesta. But by the time he had finished his run, his knowledge of geography, history and Eurovision song contest winners had won him a total of 23 cars, not to mention scores of vacuum cleaners, food hampers, waffle-makers, televisions, musical instruments, games consoles and board games (as well as a parachute jump and a trip to Lapland). “I had to hire a van to collect the prizes from the studio and put it all in storage,” he says. He also won 40kg of sweets, which he donated to a school. Many of the prizes, he has sold or given away.“Now if I’m at the supermarket, I don’t have to worry about paying 50 centimes more for a branded product, which is something I’d never have done before,” Émilien says. Otherwise, he continues to live in his usual frugal way.“It was never about the prizes,” he says. “The principal objective was always answering questions. That’s what I love. It’s really about a passion for quizzes.”Only the pure joy of quizzing could have got him this far, he says.View image in fullscreen‘Walking encyclopedia’ … Émilien on Les Douze Coups de Midi with quizmaster Jean-Luc Reichmann.Photograph: YouTubeÉmilien grew up in a small village in the Vendée in the west of France. His mother was a health assistant and his stepfather a builder. He was constantly asking questions as a child – on the quizshow, the presenter called him a “walking encyclopedia”.In his living room, there are no piles of huge reference books, just a memoir of the French singer Barbara, which he’s currently halfway through. Instead, he now works by compiling an extraordinary Google Doc of facts that he has largely honed, tested and updated through online general knowledge quizzes. “I can sit and quiz for 16–17 hours a day without doing anything else,” he says. But equally as important is his membership of quiz club meet-ups in Toulouse, where he competes and sets questions in a room at the town hall – largely with pensioners, but with membership getting younger as trivia quizzes gain popularity in France.“I just love learning,” he says. As a child he ploughed through scores of books about world records and interesting facts. “I’d learn them by heart, that’s how it all started.” Asked on the show to name the world’s busiest airport, he knew it was in Atlanta because he had read it in a book of world records when he was 10. He had begun watching The Twelve Strokes of Noon with his grandparents from the age of seven, and was soon taking notes. It was his grandmother, Yvonne, a retired childminder, who encouraged him to keep auditioning for the show – he had first tried when he was 18 but was deemed too shy. When he did get on the show, Yvonne came up to Paris for some of the filming, or appeared by video link encouraging him, and, she too, is now regularly recognised in the street.It was during the Covid pandemic that Émilien’s quizzing went up a level. He was in his final year of school and spent much of the lockdowns in his bedroom. “I started watching and rewatching TV quizshow reruns on a loop,” he says. “I loved it. I noticed that sometimes the same questions would come round again and I’d memorised the answer. I thought if I keep watching, then I’ll have more answers and it was a kind of snowball effect. I really got into the addictive side of it at that point.”He reckons he has watched and annotated so many quizshows that he must have been through hundreds of thousands of questions, noting down answers in one-word memory prompts in his Google Doc that is now about 180 pages long. He can sit for hours revising and testing his memory.The things he chooses to note down are often linked to topics that frequently come up. “If a question is ‘What Finnish classical composer …’ there’s really only one Finnish classical composer who comes up in the quizzing world: Jean Sibelius. So I noted him down a few years ago and he’s come up so often I now don’t need to look at my notes.”What about the football questions? Do you watch sports channels, I ask. He looks surprised. “I don’t learn the makeup of teams, for example Paris Saint-Germain, which would interest a fan. I learn older information that a football fan wouldn’t have or necessarily be interested in.” These include the intricacies and stats of World Cup history and the Ballon d’Or.But revision sheets are only going to get you so far – particularly when TV general knowledge quizshows span such a wide breadth of questions, from medieval monarchs to winners of Drag Race France. Émilien believes there is no such thing as a hierarchy of better or worse trivia – Beethoven and Pokémon are on a par when the question timer starts. For that broad breadth of knowledge, he has another quite simple but very fulfilling skill, he says: “listening”.View image in fullscreenÉmilien: ‘Filming a quizshow is like doing two to three exams a day.’Photograph: Frédéric Scheiber/The GuardianIf you listen extremely carefully when you’re in conversation with anyone about anything, facts will pop up that you can jot down, he says, which makes life pretty enjoyable, and conversations very enriching. This was particularly true when he had to revise contemporary music – it proved much more efficient to listen carefully in every single conversation where someone might mention a playlist. “It’s simple,” he says. “In any everyday conversation with anyone about anything at all, the discussion might turn to, ‘Oh, didn’t you know that?’ And I’ll go and jot it down. A fact might come up that interests me and I’ll take out my phone and say ‘hang on a second, I’m noting that down’. There are so many interesting facts everywhere around us.”The secret of his success is ultimately paying attention. “I realised that when you pay very careful attention to new things, even to new words that you’ve skipped when reading a book, it’s like making new discoveries for the first time. Being curious is the starting point for everything in life. I’ve always loved learning things and I think that curiosity is the basis for anyone interested in quizzing.”That ability for close listening and concentration sometimes made him appear to have supernatural powers on screen. Once, the presenter began a question “On what sea …” and Émilien immediately interjected: “The sea of tranquility”. It was the right answer (the rest of the question was about the Apollo 11 landings) and there was stupefaction on set. How was this possible? “Generally when someone asks, “on” what sea, rather than “in” what sea, the answer is a sea on the moon,” he says. “So in terms of probability it was likely to be that and in a split second I decided to try it.”The filming of the quizshow was intense. It was compressed into shoots of several weeks of five to six back-to-back episodes a day, where contestants would stay in a hotel near the studio outside Paris. Between filming sessions, Émilien would have a break of often more than a month, returning to Toulouse to revise at home every day for 16–17 hours.“You could film 75 episodes in three weeks,” he says. “I like to compare it to an exam … Filming a quizshow is like doing two to three exams a day.”To counter the stress (“which peaked just before you went on and carried on all through the episode”), sleep was his rule. “I need 10 to 11 hours a night,” he says. Once, after a train delay, he got to his hotel at 2am the night before shooting, and only got five hours’ sleep. His mind wandered for a split second during a question about the French town of Albertville in Savoie – meaning he missed a crucial part of the question. He got it right from guesswork but it was stressful.There were rituals when filming, little superstitions to try to help him through. “I always ate a fruit compote before each episode. If I hadn’t had time to do that, I’d feel quite unsettled.” He always entered the set by the same door and put his water bottle in the same place.Was he eating special food for his brain? He looks perplexed. “Honestly, I’d be the last person to advise on nutrition … I didn’t drink enough water, I’d have a burger at night and a sandwich during the day and that was it.”The question now is what does he do with all these facts, post-quizshow? Do they still bring joy? Émilien is adamant they do. And the key is moving certain topics from the Google doc into real life. “I knew nothing about botany when I started quizzing,” he says. “And I built up a vast knowledge of theory. If you gave me a plant’s name, I could tell you what family it was from. But although I could categorise a carnation, I couldn’t actually recognise a carnation in real life. So now I’ve started paying lots more attention to trees and flowers, and the other day I recognised a strelitzia plant in a garden and I was so happy. It doesn’t take much to make me happy, but there you are.”His cultural tips also come from his quizzing knowledge. Perhaps inevitably, quizzers know about a lot of films they haven’t actually watched. He decided to watch Louis Malle’s 1950s French masterpieceLift to the Scaffoldbecause it came up so often in questions. He loved it. Likewise,Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being is now his favourite book after it came up so often and so many other quizzers recommended it.He is now taking a year off before potentially resuming his history studies, taking part in online general knowledge meet-ups with the influential French trivia and gaming streamer, Étoiles, and investigating whether he could have a future as a quiz streamer or question-setter.He still goes to his regular Toulouse quiz club meet-ups. How do the others feel about your stardom, I wonder. He looks surprised. “Nothing changes just because you’ve been on TV,” he says. Others have been on TV quizshows, too, and no one is in the slightest bit fazed. “We’re all there to quiz, to share questions, to learn things, we have fun and that’s it.”He’s still curious, and he’s still adding facts to his Google doc. As we’re packing up, Frédéric, our photographer talks about a photo project in the Tadrart Rouge mountain range in Algeria. “How do you spell that again?” Émilien asks as we leave.Explore more on these topicsGame showsFranceTelevisionEuropeEntertainment TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Weighing in at more than 1,200 pages of closely printed text, the novel contains, I would hazard, about half a million words – roughly two Ulysses. It’s also, for that matter, about twice the length of Danielewski’s debut,House of Leaves, which secured cult status for its author on publication 25 years ago. Tom’s Crossing is so big that when I got it out on the tube, I felt like that character on Trigger Happy TV with his enormous mobile phone. “Look,” I seemed to be telling the passengers scrolling Instagram on their devices, “I’m reading a book!”The novel is not merely long, it’s also a challenging, deliberately arcane work that insists on its own epic status, yet has at its heart a straightforward and compelling story. Kalin March, a 16-year-old nerdy outsider in the town of Orvop in Utah, is a preternaturally talented horse rider. Through a shared love of horses, he strikes up an unlikely friendship with handsome and popular Tom Gatestone.When Tom dies of cancer, he extracts a promise from Kalin to save the two horses they love from the knacker’s yard. The bulk of the novel tells the story of Kalin’s quest to take these horses, Mouse and Navidad, to safety in the wilderness beyond the Isatch mountain range. Along the way, Kalin is joined unexpectedly by Tom’s plucky adopted little sister Landry and, even more unexpectedly, by Tom’s ghost. A violent series of events raises the stakes: the evil Orvop patriarch, Orwin Porch, owner of Porch Meats, and mortal enemy of the Gatestones, sets off to foil Kalin’s already difficult mission.There are so many choric figures that I wondered if they belonged to Danielewski superfans who had crowdfunded the novelThis bald summary doesn’t do justice to the ambition of the book or the brilliance of its plotting. The events take place over a five-day period leading up to Halloween, 1982. Purely as story, Tom’s Crossing hits a western-inflected cinematic sweet spot, with a 1980s setting, young central characters and sweeping landscapes. There are guns, horses, ghosts, a primal struggle for survival in hostile terrain, family feuds and a steadily intensifying sense of mortal threat, as Old Porch’s ambition and psychopathy escalate the drama. And the compressed timeframe of the story ticks down to a hugely satisfying climactic encounter in the mountains.And yet, for all its obvious virtues, I found Tom’s Crossing a baffling and often infuriating experience. Danielewski is a writer of enormous power and vision. He has invented a gripping story with mythic undertones that need no extra emphasis. Yet he makes a number of aesthetic choices that seem deliberately designed to frustrate normal enjoyment of the novel. One of these is the conceit, established on page one, that the epic events described in the book are already widely known. At umpteen points in the novel, we cut away from the action and explore the thoughts and attitudes of a vast chorus of named characters who have used moments in the story as the basis for their own artworks: opera, songs, sculptures, drawings, art installations. We hear about these in mindboggling detail. There are so many of these choric figures – at one point, a thousand or so names are simply listed in the text without comment – that I wondered if they belonged to Danielewski superfans who had crowdfunded the novel.The other decision that struck me as perverse is the narrative voice of the book. The novel purports to be the transcription of an oral account of the events it relates. The voice reproduced on the page is a weird mixture of Homeric and hayseed, dropping terminal “g” on participles, using double negatives, now and again renderingforasfer, yet conversant with arcane words such as cynegetic, rupestral, epicrisis, noctilucent and teichoskopia. The result is prolix and wandering and makes a long book feel much longer.“Earlier that afternoon, when for some reason Allison’s thoughts had angrily returned to the curse she’d laid upon Kalin before he’d left, warnin him from guns, makin it clear by insubstantial decree that even handlin a gun might cost him the horses he loved, and for the rest of his life, she and Sondra had returned to the Isatch Canyon parkin lot, where they’d promptly learned about the great rockfall.”This passage is one of the shorter and less challenging sections of the novel, but there’s still something characteristically inconsiderate about the way it’s constructed. The warning about the guns – though pertinent to the plot – has nothing to do with the unfolding action. In fact, it just distracts the reader from the essence of this paragraph which is:Allison and Sondra went back to the Canyon and learned about the rockfall.Why not say it like that? Well, the narrator’s voice is committed to its special idiolect, with repetition, slang and its own winding rhythms. Space prevents me quoting the weirdest examples at length, but at times it reads as though the Stranger from the film The Big Lebowski is channelling the brambly 17th-century prose of John Milton or Thomas Browne. The Stranger, you’ll remember, has a gravelly voice and a big hat, and is prone to saying things such as: “I guess that’s the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin itself down through the generations. Westward the wagons, across the sands of time, until we – ah! Look at me, I’m ramblin again.” Throw in a reference to the Iliad and an obscure adjective, say, quaquaversal, and this is basically the voice of Tom’s Crossing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There is deep knowledge about – off the top of my head – horse riding, geography, geology, myth, Mormon scripture, card games, land development, 1980s music, modern art, guns, outdoor survival and the conventions of classical literature. Furthermore, every moment in the story is exploded into second-by-second detail, irrespective of its importance to the plot. On occasions, this is sublime and thrilling. Danielewski’s ability to visualise and convey unfolding action is amazing. At other times, I was scratching my head as we disappeared down another extended digression, wondering why I was being told so much about minor characters and their irrelevant enthusiasms.In the end, Tom’s Crossing feels as though it’s been written with at least one eye on the literary immortality bestowed by academic study. Its aesthetic decisions seem designed to stimulate seminars rather than enjoyment. And to be fair, Danielewski doesn’t hide the book’s challenges: a glance at the novel’s first page will let readers know what they’re in for. Less obvious is that beneath the carapace of difficult writing and literary allusion, there’s the gratifying gooey centre of a blockbuster PG western, with limited nudity, violent scenes and oddly simple moral choices.Tom’s Crossing by Mark Z Danielewski is published by Pantheon (£30).

Yet it remains a key influence for film-makers from Sofia Coppola to Celine Song, James Ivory to Greta GerwigJames HarveyTue 4 Nov 2025 02.03 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Nov 2025 12.37 ESTShareThe first time David Lean’s 1945 romantic masterpiece was shown to the public, the audience were in stitches. It not being a comedy, this was far from ideal. The director was so embarrassed, he returned to his hotel planning to break into the film lab and burn the negative at the earliest opportunity.Eighty years on, the legacy of Brief Encounter has proved anything but. First, its train station setting and ubiquity on British TV led to parodies by everyone from Victoria Wood to Birds Eye ready meals.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Greta Gerwig hascalledit “the most romantic movie ever made”. Its central struggle – the pull of doomed, unconsummated love, of yearning between two people putting responsibility before happiness – has become the template for some of the greatest romantic stories committed to the big screen.Getting there has not been an easy ride. Set in a noirish and literally (if not figuratively) steamy 1930s, the film stars Celia Johnson as Laura - perfectly ordinary, perfectly married, and painfully middle-class. Laid low by a piece of grit in her eye at a train station, she’s attended to by a passing doctor, Alec (Trevor Howard). The pair begin a whirlwind romance – despite their better natures.View image in fullscreen‘Pleasant, but rather stupid’ … Trevor Howard with Everley Gregg (left) and Celia Johnson in Brief Encounter.Photograph: Album/AlamyThough based on Noël Coward’s pre-war 1936 short play, Still Life, Brief Encounter was conceived and shot in the less film-friendly environment of wartime Britain. The changes made from stage to screen would change the story’s soul. A year-long affair would become a seven-week infatuation. A tale of extramarital guilt became one of middle-class self-restraint. It was a sort of wish-fulfilment Lean, for one, could relate to: his accountant father had abandoned his family in similar circumstances 22 years earlier.Location filming in early 1945 was cold but happy, despite the misgivings some were beginning to have over the male lead. Howard was “pleasant, but rather stupid”, Johnson wrote. Lean agreed: “He later became a wonderful actor, but oh dear, there were a lot of things that went straight over his head.”Carnforth railway station – now a Lancashire tourist attraction complete with replica tearoom – stood in for the Home Counties setting, chosen to give the crew time to cover their lamps in the event of a German air raid. Filming was still ongoing when the crew heard the UK’s supply of Technicolor cameras was being diverted to Buckingham Palace – Johnson remembered running to the wireless between takes to hear Winston Churchill announce Germany’s surrender.View image in fullscreenRebuilding British prestige … filming Brief Encounter.Photograph: Album/AlamyThis meant that by the time Brief Encountermade it in front of an audience it was a wartime film, set before the war, playing to a postwar crowd. Perhaps that explains its curiously muted reception: despite critical adoration and Coward’s pedigree as a writer, it did solid but unremarkable business at the UK box office. Posters in the country’s industrial heartlands resorted to singing its praises “in spite of the wild praise of the London critics”.For some, the film came to embody a kind of Britishness now lost in its pre-war origins. Lord Mountbatten, writing to Coward in 1947, said: “There is no doubt in my mind that films of this sort must help to rebuild British prestige which is now temporarily eclipsed.” Months later, Mountbatten oversaw the partition of India, which left the British empire in tatters and as many as two million dead.For others, the film’s story now felt too close to home. The constant wartime movement around the country’s rail network and abroad had triggered any number of “brief encounters” all on its own – affairs without the film’s determination to stay unconsummated. Despite the story’s pre-war setting and conception, it nonetheless now conjured spectres of guilt some audiences would rather have forgotten.Adoration in certain circles, though, kept the Brief Encounter flame alive long after it left cinemas. One of 11 Grand Prix (the predecessor to the Palme d’Or) winners at the 1946 Cannes film festival, it escaped from that year’s Academy Awards with three nominations but no statuettes. The first of Sight & Sound’s now infamous critics’ polls in 1952 placed it a rung above Citizen Kane.View image in fullscreenDavid Lean and Celia Johnson arrive at Paris’s Gare du Nord station en route to pick up their prize at Cannes.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesAnd its reputation among the public grew over time. Lean remembered, coincidentally, waiting for a train when a man approached threatening to punch him. “Do you realise, sir,” Lean recalled he said, “that if Celia Johnson could contemplate being unfaithful to her husband, my wife could contemplate being unfaithful to me?” Divorce still a touchy subject in the UK, Brief Encounter’s popularity would rise as public attitudes liberalised.In the meantime, the film received an indirect boost in the US, where Billy Wilder was feeling inspired by one of Brief Encounter’s smallest characters. Valentine Dyall’s uncredited turn as a man whose empty flat almost serves as the couple’s love nest would morph into a career-best, sad-puppyish turn from Jack Lemmon.View image in fullscreenShooting the film.Photograph: Album/Alamy“I think that the interesting character is the friend who returns to his home and finds the bed still warm,” Wilder said. His more risque American take on forbidden love – 1960’s The Apartment – transplants the story from a social ladder to a corporate one, winning the best picture Oscar for which Brief Encounter had failed to secure a nomination.In the UK, the film’s recurrent place on those newfangled TV schedules meant that, by the 1970s, ad man director Alan Parker could use it to advertise Birds Eye roast beef dinners. Rachmaninov’s Second Piano Concerto – which recurs throughout the film – regularly topped polls as the UK’s favourite piece of classical music, as it continues to do today.Other influences are more subtle. Kazuo Ishiguro’s 1989 Booker prize winner The Remains of the Day bears a striking resemblance to Coward’s dialogue of middle-class repression. Its mid-century butler has internalised the same lessons of duty and propriety to such an extent he may have forgotten how to feel love at all. And the shot-reverse-shot of When Harry Met Sally’s diner scene perfectly mirrors Alec and Laura’s first lunch in a Kardomah cafe, as does the film’s conceit of a relationship built over repeat chance encounters.Following Coward’s death, too, the film’s LGBTQ+ resonances have been brought to the fore. His penchant for packing his scripts with affairs, love triangles and secret crushes had hardly gone unnoticed among the gay community of 1945.View image in fullscreenRe-encounter … Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson in Remains of the Day (1993).Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyDying just six years after homosexuality was first decriminalised in 1967, the writer’s post-mortem exit from the closet only confirmed that the film’s study of forbidden love may have meant something more to its author than the social stigma that scared Alec and Laura into obedience.In the 21st century, Sofia Coppola cited itas an inspiration for her 2003 film Lost in Translation. “You feel so much in just a gesture or a pause,” she said. “It’s so emotional but everything’s under the surface. Maybe that’s very English? But I love that.”Brief Encounter’s ideas have proved more universal than Johnson’s cut-glass accent suggests. Wong Kar-wai’s In the Mood for Love explores similar themes of buttoned-up infidelity, as much about the social pressure imposed on a relationship as the infatuation itself.View image in fullscreenTrain dreams … Teo Yoo and Greta Lee in Past Lives.Photograph: Twenty Years Rights/A24 FilmsCanadian director Celine Song explored its “what if?” question through the Korean concept ofinyeon(the romantic mystery of a sense of connection between two strangers) in her 2023 film, Past Lives. Its opening shot of a love triangle spotted across a bar mirrors Alec and Laura’s last moments together.Today, Brief Encounter holds an odd place in the lives of both Lean and Coward: a tearoom romance from a director famed for his bombastic epics, and the last great film from a writer who never thought much of the medium anyway. Still, of all their works, it might just be the one that’s lasted the longest. For 80 years, we’ve never been able to stop asking: “What if?”The National Film Theatre, London, hosts an 80th anniversary screening of Brief Encounter on 16 NovemberThis article was amended on 4 November 2025 because in an earlier version, the caption to the second picture said the person on the left was Joyce Carey, when it is a different actor in Brief Encounter, Everley Gregg.Explore more on these topicsDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Crops withered in fields nationwide, part of an estimated $60bn in damage ($160bn in 2025). Dust storms swept the midwest and northern Great Plains. Cities instituted water restrictions. That summer, unrelentingly hot temperatureskilledbetween 5,000 and 10,000 people, and Yellowstone national park suffered the worst wildfire in its history.‘How is this possible?’: a new film looks inside the appalling abuses of the Alabama prison systemRead moreAmid the disaster, George HW Bush, then Ronald Reagan’s vice-president, met with farmers in Michigan reeling from crop losses. Bush, the Republican candidate for president, consoled them: if elected, he would be the environmental president. He acknowledged the reality of intensifying heatwaves – the “greenhouse effect”, to use the scientific parlance of the day – with blunt clarity: the burning of fossil fuels contributed excess carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, leading to global warming. But though the scale of the problem could seem “impossible”, he assured the farmers that “those who think we’re powerless to do anything about this greenhouse effect are forgetting about the White House Effect” – the impact of sound environmental policy for the leading consumer of fossil fuels. Curbing emissions, he said, was “the common agenda of the future”.That clip – startling to anyone even glancingly familiar with Republican orthodoxy in the years since – appears early in The White House Effect, a new all-archival documentary that examines the evolution of the climate crisis from non-partisan reality to divisive political issue. The 96-minute film, now available onNetflix, takes its name from Bush’s unfulfilled guarantee of environmental action during his four years as president, a pivotal missed opportunity – if not, as the film implicitly argues,thepivotal missed opportunity – for bipartisan US leadership on the climate crisis. “There was this moment in time when the science was widely accepted, when the public was all about tackling this,” co-director Pedro Kos told the Guardian. “It was a mom and pop issue, as American as apple pie. Flash forward to four years later, and you have a completely split electorate. How do we get there?”The film, directed by Kos with Jon Shenk and Bonni Cohen, first rewinds the clock from Bush’s uncontroversial campaign promise back to the 1970s, when the science on the greenhouse effect became a public talking point. In news footage from the late 70s, ordinary Americans react to Jimmy Carter’s exhortation to face “a problem that’s unprecedented in our history” with patriotic enthusiasm; sacrifices, they confirm, may be necessary. By the early 1980s, faced with a gas shortages and hours-long lines at the pump, some of that enthusiasm had crumbled. As the Republican presidential candidate, Reagan responded to the discontent by blaming the government and calling for authority to be transferred back to the private sector (or, to use a Reagan euphemism, “experts in the field”) – setting the stage for the Republican party’s symbiotic relationship with large oil companies well aware of the impact of emissions on the climate. (To quote an internal Exxon document from 1984: “We can either adapt our civilization to a warmer planet or avoid the problem by sharply curtailing the use of fossil fuels.”)But the film largely focuses on Bush, a blue blood east coaster who made his fortune in the Texas oilfields, and who nevertheless began his term in office in 1989 determined, at least outwardly, to break from his predecessor on the environment. Bush appointed an environmental activist, William Reilly, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency; he exhorted Congress that “the time for action is now.” The White House Effect illustrates the political forces that eroded such purpose: the corporations that, according to their own internal documents, sought to downplay and discredit scientific evidence to protect their profit; the power games by White House chief of staff John Sununu, an ally of corporate lobbyists who outmaneuvered Reilly by encouraging climate skepticism in the aftermath of disasters such as Hurricane Hugo and the devastating Exxon-Valdez oil spill.The film works exclusively with meticulously edited archival footage – the team sorted through more than 14,000 clips from more than 100 sources, including VHS tapes stored in the New Jersey garage of a former Exxon Mobil publicist and a memo from a confidential “Global Warming Scientific ‘Skeptics’ Meeting” convened in 1991 by Sununu to empower media appearances by prominent climate contrarians. The reliance on archival was part of an effort to “immerse the public in a time when this wasn’t a political football – where we experience the politicization of the issue, rather than being told it”, said Kos. “Whenever you turn on a camera and interview someone in the present, that’s automatically going to come with the political connotations that the present brings.”View image in fullscreenA still from The White House Effect.Photograph: NetflixCohen and Shenk are veterans of climate change films; the married couple directed An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, the follow-up to Al Gore’s groundbreaking documentary on looming climate catastrophe. But with The White House Effect, “we wanted to do something very different from what we’ve done in our past work and what we think of as the ‘climate change genre’ of documentaries: we wanted to just drop the truth bomb of history,” said Shenk. “We need that, right? We just need the truth.”With archival, there’s “an opportunity to expand the conversation”, Cohen added. From man-on-the-street interviews to standard network broadcasts from the period, “hopefully you can see yourself in the film no matter who you are as an American, and feel that you’re part of the conversation, rather than some liberal film-makers preaching at you.”The platforming of climate skeptics on mainstream media and Sununu’s counsel seemed to have an effect on Bush. By 1990, speaking at a White House conference on the climate crisis, he equivocated where he once held firm: “One scientist argued that if we keep burning fossil fuels at today’s rate, by the end of the next century, Earth could be 9F warmer than today. And the other scientist saw no evidence of rapid change,” he said. “Two scientists, two diametrically opposed points of view. Now, where does that leave us?” It left the US hamstrung by political division. Two years later, the “environmental president” reluctantly attended the 1992 Rio “Earth Summit”, a major United Nations conference to set international targets for emissions reductions, advocating against such measures in the name of economic development and stability. The move, from the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, angered other countries, but Bush chided the international coalition: “I don’t think leadership is going along with the mob.” The seeds for outright climate denial, and the Republican party’s unfettered and open alliance with corporate interests, had been sown.View image in fullscreenA still from The White House Effect.Photograph: NetflixNearly three decades later, in 2019, Reilly rued how the US missed an “incalculably important” opportunity at Rio. “The advantage we might have had if president Bush had committed to seriously undertake the reduction of greenhouse gases is that we might have removed the partisan nature of the dialogue in the United States,” he said. If that prospect, in the era of hyper-partisanship, increasingly absurd natural disasters and the Trump administration’s dismantling of environmental regulation, feels deeply infuriating – well, Cohen argued, that’s the point. “Climate change films, at least in the last 10 years, have been trying to spoon-feed the medicine of the climate crisis, and then have a ‘hope bucket’ at the end, where you can feel OK,” she said. “Our job is to create the rage. We can’t shy away from the rage. And if this film, in all of its irrefutable archival historical glory, can create that rage, then we’ve succeeded.”The hope, she added, is that “you can feel the rage and you can feel the intolerance for the denial of truth, and that you’ll actually do something about at the ballot box. The hopelessness is when you feel like you can’t do anything. But we have a large electorate in this country – let’s get out there.”Kos, having overseen the mass archival effort, encouraged viewers to look at “the overall arc of history” – even in the face of the Los Angeles fires, the Texas floods, the rapid and unprecedented intensification of hurricanes like the one that devastated Jamaica just last week – “what good is despair going to do?” The truth of political power, for good and for ill, is “right there in front of our eyes.”“The choice is in our hands,” he added. “We’ve shown you a what-if moment from 1988. We’re now in another what-if moment.”The White House Effect is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsNetflixGeorge BushClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

André, Michel and Daniel are former wards of the church-run Belle Étoile correctional school in the Savoie town of Mercury and, now in their 60s and 70s, they recount a barrage of abuse at the hands of Abbot Garin and his lackeys: beatings that inflicted permanent damage, sleep deprivation, cold-water baths, starvation, nocturnal molestation.As director Clémence Davigo sits in on their long reminiscence sessions, the damage is clear. Michel weeps at the memory of his humiliations: deprived of a nurturing education, André became a career criminal, spending decades in prison; the alert-eyed Daniel, sexually abused and trapped in “hell”, speaks of later being emotionally crippled, unable to tell anyone he loves them. Michel and Daniel, an indefatigable chef and runner respectively, have found displacement activities, the means by which it is possible to empty their heads of the horror.But the trio also talk of emptying in a different sense: to relieve themselves of this burden and seek restitution. Davigo’s attention shifts in the film’s second half to whether this is possible, and in what form. André and Michel disagree on whether the Catholic church as an institution is culpable – or just, as the latter believes, the specific individuals at the Belle Étoile. The two diocese counsellors they meet indicate that, in its willingness to acknowledge the wrongs done, the church is sorry. But when they finally meet the presiding archbishop, Philippe Ballot, he seems slow to commit to concrete actions.Davigo keeps a steady, observant hand on the directorial tiller, her calm interludes letting metaphors emerge naturally. For example, Daniel slowly climbs a nearby mountain, a dragonfly sloughing off its old skin. The film isn’t a systematic inquest into institutional abuse, cover-ups and the feasibility of reform, which are certainly pertinent questions in France after the likes of theAbbé Pierre scandal. Rather, it participates intimately in the healing process by giving these men the platform to tell their truths – and is no less valuable for it.The Lost Boys of Mercury is on True Story from 7 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsFranceCatholicismChristianityEuropeReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Shot in thenow defunct republic of Artsakh, the film follows four extraordinary women who find their hopes and ambitions cruelly derailed by war. The breakaway state was formed in 1991, after decades of political discrimination under the Soviet Union and military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. For the predominantly Armenian population here, their peace has always been under threat.The personal journeys of Mkrtichian’s subjects feel even more remarkable in the face of these uncertainties. A judo champion, Sose aspires to represent her country at the Olympics; Siranush campaigns to be on the city council; and Gayane runs a support group for women. For those living in Artsakh, memories of the last war are more than a spectre; working in bomb disposal, Sveta defuses mines that are still lodged in the verdant landscape. Though their professions vary, they are all committed to bettering the community, a testament to the strong cultural bonds that exist here.Captured with dynamism and intimacy, their individual stories collide whenwar breaks out in 2020. As the Azerbaijani army closes in, the women’s daily lives are disrupted by the sounds of sirens, and even explosions. Gayane and her family become displaced; they now live in Armenia as refugees. Sose, heartbreakingly, has to put her sports career on hold as she joins the military. In a contrast to an earlier scene, in which the bubbly young woman teaches judo to a class of children, she is now seen instructing a group of women on weapon assembly. With such burdens on their shoulders, it is a tragedy that Gayane and the rest of her community are forced to leave their dreams behind.There Was, There Was Not isat Bertha DocHouse, London, from 7 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsNagorno-KarabakhWomenAzerbaijanArmeniaEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Louise, the young woman at the centre of this beguiling film, is a mirage of a character; introduced in fragments, we first hear her lilting lamentations against a darkened screen. This is followed by closeups of a yellow notebook, in which her fears and desires overflow on every page, as they are read out by a mysterious, unseen man.When Louise finally materialises on screen, her everyday existence unfurls over deceptively mundane episodes. Through these sequences, Pagliai builds a fascinating tension between the stillness of the compositions and Louise’s agitated psyche. She is often seen in darkness, her face lit by the glow of various screen devices that flicker with snippets of songs and film scenes. This virtual flood of audiovisual materials takes on a literal form as if by magic, we see Louise out of her room and into the woods. Here, she encounters Thomas, the male narrator whose voice appears at the beginning of the film. At one point, Louise is partially submerged in a moonlit pond, a modern-day Ophelia swept up by unanswered fantasies.In contrast to this melancholic mood, Pagliai’s visual style is thrillingly eclectic. The mix of painterly static shots and lo-fi, handheld footage channels a state of emotional paralysis. When Louise speaks of a violent sexual assault that might or might not have taken place, her story is accompanied by a dizzying cascade of images where human figures are grotesquely distorted. Her tone, however, is as detached as when she describes her masturbation habits; that the images might have been generated by AI further emphasises her alienation. In this age of constant distraction, even the realm of imagination and memory is not safe from the intrusion of technology.Fantaisie is at the ICA, London from 7 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDocumentary filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sure, they might bedeck their album sleeves with ghouls, goblins, manacled maidens and brawny barbarians, but did a member of Cirith Ungol ever have to retrieve a missing unicorn horn from a snowy field in the depths of winter? Has Yngwie Malmsteen spent time squinting in the back of a tour bus, repairing his own chainmail?Formed in 2019, Brooklyn’s Castle Rat have had to face both these scenarios and more as they live out their epic fantasies. From heraldic, earworm-heavy anthems to eye-popping live shows, costume design, videos and album art, they’re not so much a metal band as a full immersive experience.“Castle Rat wasn’t meant to be a costumed concept band,” says singer, guitarist, sword-wielder and creative overlord Riley Pinkerton as the band’s tour van speeds from a sold-out gig in Cologne to another in Aschaffenburg – they’re also doing five gigs in the UK this week. “We played two shows and got booked on a Halloween gig, where I made a last-minute decision to dress up. It was all super-DIY, but we had so much fun and the feeling in the room was electric. I thought, ‘What if we could have this much fun every time?’”Since then, the band – which features Pinkerton as the “Rat Queen” alongside a plague doctor (Charley Ruddell, bass), haughty vampire (Franco Vittore, guitar) and mysterious druid (Joshua Strmic, drums) – haven’t looked back. The Bestiary, the band’s second album, conjures visions ofBlack Sabbath,Iron Maidenand Manowar joining forces to battle their way through a Frank Frazetta fantasy world – a heroic opus that places them on the brink of far grander things.The Bestiary was a first for Pinkerton in that she opened the floor to her bandmates. “It made it a lot stronger,” she says of the collaborative process. “I struggled at first – I’d always felt a certain amount of pride being a woman in music going it alone. There’ve been so many times where I’ve got off stage and some guy will say, ‘Those guys write great riffs!’ and I’m like, ‘Hey –Iwrote all that.’”As the band’s stature has grown, so has the scope of their production design. “My motto is always that if it’s worth doing, it’s worthoverdoing,” Pinkerton laughs. She was originally on course for a fine art degree before balking at the prospect of so much debt. “The fun thing about Castle Rat is there’s so many different ways to apply artistic expression,” she says. “Whether it’s making masks, costume design, learning how to edit music videos … it’s all stuff I don’t know how to do, but it’s fun to figure it out on the fly.”As if building the band’s intricate lore (“Everyone’s urging me to write it down because it’s all in here,” Riley says, tapping her head) and stitching garments wasn’t enough, the singer taught herself how to make chainmail – no mean feat, though she admittedly left her all-new scalemail look to a New York-based specialist. “It feels like actualarmour,” she beams.View image in fullscreen‘There’s not an alternative version of the show where I don’t have a sword’ … Riley Pinkerton.Photograph: Peter BesteAs for audiences? They took to the fake blood, foam swords and papier-mache rat skulls with as much gusto as the band. “We played a show in Detroit and it looked like a Renaissance fair,” recalls Riley fondly. “Everyone was in cloaks, sheepskin, chainmail.”This isn’t to say, however, that life on the road as sword’n’sorcery vagabonds has been plain sailing. “Everything is constantly breaking and ends up duct-taped together,” Riley says. “Plus I’ll have endless ideas as to how I want things to look, but we’re travelling in a van with only so much space. It’s an interesting challenge to make it feel like a larger-than-life story, then pack it down into nothing.”There have been other logistical problems that would never have plagued Conan the Cimmerian or Dark Agnes de Chastillon. “We did have an ‘oh shit’ moment when we played SonicBlast festival in Portugal and my luggage – which had my sword in it – got lost,” says Riley. “That was a worst-case scenario, because there’s not an alternative version of the show where I don’t have a sword.”Like a true warrior queen, Riley is gung-ho about the future. “I want to go all the way – let’s do stadiums,” she says. “The only thing that’s really important to me is keeping the DIY aesthetic, making sure everything is handmade. That’s an element I want to keep true, no matter what we scale to. Oh, and I want to ride out on a unicorn every night. You know howRob Halforddoes the motorcycle thing? That, but with a unicorn.”Castle Rat’s UK tour commences at Concorde 2, Brighton, on 4 November.Explore more on these topicsMetalPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Talk about setting the tone.Ethel Smyth’s Der Wald (premiered in Berlin in 1902) and Ottorino Respighi’s Lucrezia – first performed in 1937 although this, remarkably, was its UK premiere – will have been new to most in the Silk Street theatre. Yet both scores could have “RW woz ’ere” graffitied on them, such is Wagner’s impact on their musical language.Der Waldveers into total fandom. Here’s a dark, Romantic forest inhabited by innocent lovers. There’s a dramatic soprano wreaking social havoc. “Tod und Liebe” – death and love – sings the female innocent at the end in her own miniature Liebestod. InStephen Barlow’s production, the lighting is set at “gloomy” and the action is in 1950s North America, the woodlanders clad in denim and plaid while Iolanthe the pseudo-Valkyrie arrives on a motorbike.View image in fullscreenPalpably having fun: Ethel Smyth’s Der WaldPhotograph: David Monteith-HodgeThe cast was palpably having fun. The chorus and smaller roles were an energetic, vibrant presence, Sonny Fielding’s turn as the peddler andRedmond Sanders’ as local landowner Rudolf (here an all-mouth-and-trousers cowboy) especially persuasive.Avery Lafrentzmanoeuvred her huge, hard-edged soprano effectively as Iolanthe, Harry Jacques was a warm, sympathetic Heinrich andSeohyun Gowas excellent as his fiancee Röschen, her tone both generous and carefully controlled. If the impassioned climax of the opera’s love duet felt underheated as Röschen took off her cardigan, it was partly down to the orchestra, conducted byDominic Wheeler. The lush string tone of the opening never quite returned and, despite some shapely woodwind solos, the playing lacked the polish and amplitude needed to make this opera truly compelling.The orchestra fared better in Respighi’s Lucrezia, where Wagner lurks behind the twin filters of Puccini andStraussin a score that embraces extremes of harshness and beauty. There were moments of tactile earthiness from the cellos and basses, terrifying, febrile activity in the woodwind and hefty slabs of brass, while the strings eked out slow, traumatised drags as the heroine (better known to operagoers viaBrittenand to classicists viaLivy and Ovid) narrates how she had been raped.Barlow’s staging places the ever-shocking plot in a modern US courtroom, the men in suits and sandals, the women in toga-like dresses. Gabriella Giulietta Noble demonstrated a gift for storytelling as La Voce (here a black-suited legal professional providing periodic commentary), while Manon Ogwen Parry’s Venilia and Hannah McKay’s Lucrezia stood out from the impressive cast in their assured dramatic and vocal intensity. It was a powerful argument for a work we should clearly know better.Further performances on 5, 7 and 10 November,Silk Street theatre, Barbican, LondonExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Much online brouhaha and frustration ensued at yet another Hollywood misrepresentation of modern day Ireland. The trailer was eventuallyrevealed to be an elaborate rusebyEpic, the Irish Emigration Museum in Dublin, to call out the tired stereotypes and “to find out who the Irish really are”.Fanad lighthouse map and surrounding areaIreland, and the Irish, are many things. The country’s economic and social structures have changed rapidly in recent decades but that doesn’t necessarily mean the culture has altered unrecognisably. What has changed is the increasing draw to connect with Ireland’s natural landscapes. Writers such as the lateTim Robinson,Manchán Maganand the popular podcasterBlindboyboatclubhave been pivotal in mining the connection between the natural world and the country’s past. TheIrish language has seen a renaissancein the past few years for the same reason. In his 2020 bestselling bookThirty-Two Words for Field, Magan writes: “Irish has a rich store of words that offers a more soulful and nature-connected way of seeing the world. It lets you live more deeply in your environment.”To test Magan’s hypothesis, I travelled with my family to the Fanad peninsula in theGaeltacht(Irish speaking) area of County Donegal this summer. The bilingual road sign that welcomed us to Fanad/Fánaidimmediately delivered a geographical context, fána being the Irish word for sloping ground. Knockalla mountain (Cnoc Colbha– the hill of the edge) loomed to the east, calling to mind images of the ice sheets that carved the ridge along the twin peaks about 14,000 years ago.View image in fullscreenFergal and family enjoy having the beach to themselves.Photograph: Fergal McCarthyThe ice age also had an impact on Fanad’s coast. The rocks that still line the foreshores of its pristine beaches were left behind by retreating glaciers and pounded ever since by the North Atlantic to make sand. We sought out one of those white beaches at Ballyhiernan Bay (Bá BhaileUíThiarnáin –the townland of Tiarnán). My phone offered no details of shadowy Tiarnán’s biography, but I wanted to find out more about why a whole bay was named after him – Robinson was right: “place names tell stories”. We were alone on the beach, our only company the swallows that surfed the air currents above the crashing waves. My 16-year-old son and I had spent the past year attending “pop-upGaeltachts”in Dublin pubs in preparation for his stint working at an Irish college, a rite of passage for Irish teenagers, yet the Irish word for swallow eluded him. It isfáinleog, probably fromfánmeaning to wander or to leave, perfectly capturing the penchant of these summer visitors for travelling to Africa in the winter.Irish has a rich store of words that offers a more soulful and nature-connected way of seeing the worldManchán MaganThe process of anglicising Irish place names began in the early 19th century, following the 1800 Act of Union, with towns being renamed as part of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, which began in 1824. This act of cultural erasure was soon followed by the great famine, from 1845 to 1852, which decimated the Irish-speaking population. In 1980, decades before the recent resurgence of interest in Ireland’s linguistic past, the Donegal playwright Brian Friel mined this pivotal era for his 1833-set opus Translations. The play’s erudite schoolmaster Hugh, who refers to Irish as “a syntax opulent with tomorrows”, might have smiled warmly at the idea of musicians such asCMAT,Fontaines DCandKneecapreleasing songs in the language nearly two centuries later.Settling in for our stay at acottage within the grounds of Fanad lighthouse, the view from our sitting room looked west to the towering cliffs of Tory Island (Toraigh– place of steep rocky heights), another far-flung corner where the native language maintains a grip, and famous for having akinguntil 2018. Ascending the vertiginous steps to the lantern room afforded us an even better view, with Malin Head (Cionn Mhálanna– high headland), Ireland’s most northerly tip, clearly visible across Lough Swilly (Loch Súilí– lake of eyes or shadows). The enormous expanse of sea to the north created a sense of the earth’s curvature, and Scotland and Iceland seemed almost within reach, somewhere in the distance.The next morning, whilekayakingunder the nearby cliffs and blowholes with knowledgable local guide Hugh Hunter, oystercatchers dived overhead, calling out angrily as we paddled by their nesting grounds. These black and white seabirds with orange, chisel-like beaks migrate here from the neighbouring Nordic countries every autumn. My son is none the wiser about the Irish for oystercatcher:Roilleach an Giolla Brighde, meaningthe servant of Saint Brigid. The story goes that Ireland’s patroness saint was hidden from an angry mob by a flock of oystercatchers who covered her in seaweed.View image in fullscreenKayaking with knowledgable guide Hugh Hunter.Photograph: Fergal McCarthyThat afternoon, we joined the throng in theLighthouse Tavernto watch the All-Ireland football final between Donegal and Kerry. There was a loud cheer in a mixture of Irish and English each time the home team scored. At half-time we joined a group of local teenagers as they discussed their impending university courses in Dublin. I wondered how their lives would change and who among them might come back, like the swallows and oystercatchers, to this far-flung peninsula.Later in the week, stopping for directions to Port Na Ling (harbour of the ships) beach, a local man engaged us in conversation, explaining he hadn’t spoken a word of English until he went to secondary school. He pointed out the house where he grew up with 11 siblings, among a constellation of white-washed bungalows on the hillside the other side of Mulroy Bay (An Mhaoil Rua– meaning the bare hill). Ireland’s pre-famine, largely rural population, peaked at about 8.2 million and a sense of how the country’s built environment looked back then is somehow still tangible in many coastal Donegal communities. Gweedore (Gaoth Dobhair– estuary of water), an hour away to the west, is described as one of Europe’s most densely populated rural areas. In the aftermath of the famine, people in Donegal largely survived by travelling to Scotland as potato pickers, and this seasonal work allowed the county’s population to remain relatively buoyant, with locals returning home in the winter months rather than emigrating permanently.View image in fullscreenView over the coastline of Gweedore, described as one of Europe’s most densely populated rural areas.Photograph: Gareth McCormack/AlamyWe finished our time in Fanad by following theWay of the Crossup Knockalla to an outdoor altar with three crosses looking out across the peninsula. Blindboyboatclub explains that “the Irish landscape itself acts as a storyteller, whispers tales of the past”. The pathway we had just ascended has been a place of spiritual significance for millennia, long before being co-opted by Christianity. The many standing stones and ancient sites strewn across the fields are signifiers of a secret history. We were the only people to climb the mountain that morning, and what a privilege to have this sacred site to ourselves.Our time in Fanad had been a portal to viewing the landscape afresh. Magan was right: the Irish language is an extraordinary conduit to the past and offers us a better understanding of the present.Two-nightstays atFanadlighthousefrom€350.

What to do with them before the next lot arrive?Christine, OxfordThis sounds like a job for Claire Dinhut, author ofThe Condiment Book, who also goes by the moniker Condiment Claire. She would approach this meal by meal, starting with breakfast. “It might not seem so obvious,” she says, “but I put Branston pickle on my avocado toast. If you think about it, you often add acidity, which is usually lemon, but chutney is punchy and has that same tang, as well as a bit of texture.” Regardless of what jars Christine has hanging around, Dinhut would also consider the breakfast bap: “Whether it’s spicy mango, peach, chilli or tomato chutney, that would be so delicious with an egg yolk.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

If you’re putting chicken breasts in the air fryer, for example, smear mango chutney [peach also works well] all over the meat, which will give it a really nice glaze.” Cyrus Todiwala, author ofModern Indian: Small Plates, Big Flavours, Fabulous Feasts, meanwhile, puts his mango chutney in a blender and purees it: “That’s the ideal glaze for brushing on chicken, turkey or pork before roasting.”Soup is hot right now, so if you’re having a bowl of squash or pumpkin soup, you could do a lot worse than spreading a piece of baguette with soured cream and chutney and using that for dunking, Dinhut says. She also has form for adding chutney (think apple or tomato) to salad dressings instead of honey: “It brings that bit of texture, vinegar and sweetness, which is especially good in a rice or barley salad with roast sweet potato, dried cranberries and goat’s cheese.”But do remember to keep things clean. “It burns me up when people take a spoon and scrape it around the sides of the jar,” Todiwala says. “That’s the place where fungus will start to grow, so keep the lid and edges of the jar clean by wiping them with a dry cloth or some kitchen paper after use.” That way, no jar will ever be left behind: “When you do finish a jar, use up the last few bits of chutney by cracking in a couple of eggs, sealing the jar and giving it a good shake. Then use the contents to make scrambled eggs,” Dinhut says. And those will happily do you for breakfast, lunch or dinner.Got a culinary dilemma?
