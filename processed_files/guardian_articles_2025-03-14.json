He will seek to pile pressure on the Russian president to “finally come to the table” and “stop the barbaric attacks on Ukraine” after Kyivagreed this weekto an immediate 30-day ceasefire.European nations, the EU Commission, Nato, Canada,Ukraine, Australia and New Zealand are expected to take part in the virtual meeting and provide updates on the aid they could provide towards enforcing a peace deal.It came asPutinpraised Donald Trump for “doing everything”to improve relations between Moscow and Washington, after Trump said the US has had “very good and productive discussions” with Putin in recent days.Putin told a meeting of his security heads that improved relations with the US were now on the agenda. “We know that the new administration headed by President Trump is doing everything to restore at least something of what was basically destroyed by the previous US administration,” he said.View image in fullscreenA soldier from the 93rd Separate Mechanised Brigade in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, 13 March 2025.Photograph: Ukraine’s 93rd Mechanised Brigade/EPAPutin also responded to an appeal by Trump to save the lives of “thousands” of surrounded Ukrainian soldiers, and said he would heed it as long as the soldiers surrendered. However, no evidence has emerged to back up Putin and Trump’s claims that there is a large-scale encirclement of Ukrainian troops, a claim explicitly denied by military officials in Kyiv.The exchange of warm words between Trump and Putin is likely to cause further alarm in Kyiv and European capitals, already spooked by signs of the new US administration cosying up to Moscow while exerting pressure on Ukraine.The remarks came after Steve Witkoff, Trump’s close ally and special envoy to the Middle East, held late-night talks with Putin on Thursday to discuss the US proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire in war on Ukraine.Kyiv has already accepted the proposal, while Putin on Thursday set out a series of sweeping conditions that would need to be met beforeRussiawould agree to the truce, which includes the condition that Ukraine should neither rearm nor mobilise during the 30-day truce.On Friday night, in speech at the Department of Justice, Trump said the US had had “good calls” with Ukraine and Russia during the day. “I think we’ve had some very good results,” he said. “Just before I came here I got some pretty good news.”He did not provide any details, but he later told reporters that he felt that “Russia is going to make a deal with us”.View image in fullscreenA destroyed building and damaged vehicle at a settlement recaptured by Russian forces in the Kursk region of Russia.Photograph: Russian Defense Ministry/Xinhua/Rex/ShutterstockDowning Street refused to set out precisely what goals the prime minister hoped to get from Saturday morning’s meeting, saying it was “a fast-moving situation” with a large number of countries involved.UK officials had expected to be able to release the full list of attenders in advance, but were seemingly prevented from doing so by the complexity of organising such a large event at speed. There were reports that the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, might not attend the meeting due to worries about the Anglo-French plans to try to guarantee a long-term peace deal.Starmer will be expected to set out to the assembled leaders details of a plan, spearheaded by him and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in the wake of Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s disastrous White House meeting with Trump two weeks ago. Starmer and Macron spoke one-to-one on Friday evening in advance of the summit, Downing Street said.In comments released by Downing Street before the summit, Starmer lambasted Putin over what he called “empty words and pointless conditions”.“We can’t allow President Putin to play games with President Trump’s deal,” Starmer said. “The Kremlin’s complete disregard for President Trump’s ceasefire proposal only serves to demonstrate that Putin is not serious about peace.“If Russia finally comes to the table, then we must be ready to monitor a ceasefire to ensure it is a serious, and enduring peace, if they don’t, then we need to strain every sinew to ramp up economic pressure on Russia to secure an end to this war.“Putin is trying to delay, saying there must be a painstaking study before a ceasefire can take place, but the world needs to see action, not a study or empty words and pointless conditions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Putin first made the claim earlier in the week when he said Ukrainian troops had been surrounded during a retreat from Russia’s Kursk region, and had the choice to “surrender or die”.Trump repeated Putin’s claim, writing that thousands of troops had been “completely surrounded” during the retreat. “I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!” he wrote.Putin told his security council that he had heard Trump’s appeal, and said the lives of Ukrainian troops would be spared if they surrendered. The Ukrainian military and independent analysts, however, denied there was an encirclement of troops.“Reports of the alleged ‘encirclement’ of Ukrainian units by the enemy in the Kursk region are false and fabricated by the Russians for political manipulation and to exert pressure on Ukraine and its partners,” the general staff wrote in a statement published on its media channels. “There is no threat of encirclement of our units.”Ukrainian security sources, independent military analysts and even pro-Russian Telegram channels disputed the encirclement claims by Putin and Trump.Despite apparent optimism from the White House, US intelligence services have reportedly assessed that Putin remains committed to achieving “his maximalist goal of dominating Ukraine”.The Washington Postreportedon Friday the contents of an intelligence report circulated among Trump administration policymakers on 6 March, which stated that Putin remained determined to maintain control over Kyiv.Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerVladimir PutinDonald TrumpEuropean UnionNatoRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The family are being supported by specialist trained officers and our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time.”The vessel hit a US-flagged tanker, the Stena Immaculate, carrying jet fuel for the American military, which was anchored while waiting for space at a port in the Humber, having travelled from the Peloponnese region of Greece.The Solong was sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands at a speed of about 16 knots, equivalent to 18mph, when it collided with the tanker.Both vessels caught fire after several explosions and 36 crew were rescued, including Americans onboard the Stena Immaculate and members of the Russian and Filipino crew of the Solong.Earlier on Friday, the chief coastguard, Paddy O’Callaghan, said both vessels were “stable” and salvors had boarded them to continue damage assessments.He said: “There are now only small periodic pockets of fire on the Solong which are not causing undue concern.“Specialist tugs with firefighting capability remain at both vessels’ locations.“Regular aerial surveillance flights continue to monitor the vessels and confirm that there continues to be no cause for concern from pollution from either the Stena Immaculate or from the Solong.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

ICBs, regional health service bodies which oversee groupings of NHS trusts, employ 25,000 people between them.Sir Jim Mackey, NHS England’s incoming new chief executive, has told the ICBs to cut their running costs by 50% by the end of the year. “Given ICBs employ 25,000 people, that means that half of them are going to go,” a senior NHS official said. That could lead to 12,500 posts being lost.In addition, Mackey has also ordered the 220 NHS trusts that provide care across England to cut the number of people working in corporate services, such as HR, finance and communications. That could lead to thousands more officials losing their jobs, insiders say.Mackey passed on the grim news to ICB and trust leaders in phone calls and meetings this week. He outlined the NHS’s need to undertake budget cuts on a huge scale as part of a “reset” of the service’s finances to help it avoid overspending by the £6.6bn in 2025-26 that initial estimates said was likely.Mackey, who is succeeding Amanda Pritchard on 1 April but already making key decisions about the NHS’s future, told service bosses that the prospect of such a massive deficit had “scared the living daylights” out of government ministers, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) reported.Senior figures running ICBs say the order to halve their running costs will make it impossible for them to undertake the full range of their activities, which include funding vaccination programmes, offering blood pressure checks and improving children’s dental health. ICBs have recently finished reducing their budgets by 20% as part of a previous round of cost-saving.“Operationally, this could be a disaster – 50% on top of what some ICBs have already done is huge. There will definitely be job losses,” said one ICB official.“In our ICB we have no more ‘fat’ to trim. It’s very difficult to see how, if implemented in a blanket way, this doesn’t lead to service cuts.”Julian Kelly, NHS England’s outgoing deputy chief executive, told the Commons public accounts committee on Thursday that ICB staff being cut by half was part of the wide-ranging reorganisation of NHS England that Keir Starmer andWes Streeting, the health secretary, unveiled on Thursday in an announcement that few insiders knew was coming.Kelly told the cross-party committee, which scrutinises government spending, that reducing NHS England’s staffing by 50% would save £400m a year and that if the staff budget for the 42 ICBs was subjected to a similarly brutal cut that would save a further £750m a year, once the programme of job losses was complete. He did not indicate how many posts could go.The sheer scale of budget cuts Mackey is pursuing is causing consternation across the NHS. One leader told the HSJ that the size and speed of the cut to ICB running costs was “terrifying” and would cause chaos for the service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the bigger issue is the 50% cut not only to central capacity but to systems [ICBs] and trust corporate services,” Taylor told the Guardian.“As well as leading to thousands of redundancies, the danger is that the scale of change and insecurity will distract organisations from the daunting task of achieving recovery and reform in the context of an unprecedented financial squeeze.”Matt Barrow, a national officer with the FDA union, which represents many DHSC staff, said: “Stopping duplication is one thing but a 50% cut to staffing following the merger of NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care goes way beyond that.“Ministers, of course, have the democratic right to determine the size of the state but you cannot make cuts of this scale without consequences. If you are cutting staff, there won’t be enough people to do the same amount of work and ministers will have to decide what they want to stop doing.”Explore more on these topicsHealth policyNHSEnglandWes StreetingLabourHealthPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

That would put them on course for an undocking next week and a splashdown off theFloridacoast, weather permitting.The duo will be escorted back by astronauts who flew up on a rescue mission onSpaceXlast September alongside two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams on the return leg.Swollen eyeballs, baby-like skin, and the overview effect: how astronauts feel when they return to earthRead moreRocketing toward orbit from Nasa’s KennedySpaceCenter, the newest crew includes Nasa’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, both military pilots; and Japan’s Takuya Onishi and Russia’s Kirill Peskov, both former airline pilots. They will spend the next six months at the space station, considered the normal stint, after springing Wilmore and Williams free.As test pilots for Boeing’s new Starliner capsule, Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched from Cape Canaveral on 5 June. A series of helium leaks and thruster failures marred their trip to the space station, setting off months of investigation byNasaand Boeing on how best to proceed.Eventually ruling it unsafe, Nasa ordered Starliner to fly back empty last September and moved Wilmore and Williams to aSpaceXflight due back in February.Their return was further delayed when SpaceX’s brand new capsule needed extensive battery repairs before launching their replacements. To save a few weeks, SpaceX switched to a used capsule, moving up Wilmore and Williams’ homecoming to mid-March.Already capturing the world’s attention, their unexpectedly long mission took a political twist when Donald Trump and SpaceX’s Elon Muskvowed earlier this yearto accelerate the astronauts’ return and blamed the former administration for stalling it.Retired Navy captains who have lived at the space station before, Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly stressed that they support the decisions made by their Nasa bosses since last summer.“We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short,” Wilmore said, adding that he did not believe Nasa’s decision to keep them on the ISS had been affected by politics.“That’s what your nation’s human spaceflight program’s all about,” he said, “planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.”The two helped keep the station running – fixing a broken toilet, watering plants and conducting experiments – and even went out on a spacewalk together. With nine spacewalks, Williams set a new record for women: the most time spent spacewalking over a career.A last-minute hydraulics issue delayed Wednesday’s initial launch attempt. Concern arose over one of the two clamp arms on the Falcon rocket’s support structure that needs to tilt away right before liftoff. SpaceX later flushed out the arm’s hydraulics system, removing trapped air.The duo’s extended stay has been hardest, they said, on their families – Wilmore’s wife and two daughters, and Williams’ husband and mother. Besides reuniting with them, Wilmore, a church elder, is looking forward to getting back to face-to-face ministering and Williams can’t wait to walk her two Labrador retrievers.“We appreciate all the love and support from everybody,” Williams said in an interview earlier this week. “This mission has brought a little attention. There’s goods and bads to that. But I think the good part is more and more people have been interested in what we’re doing” with space exploration.Explore more on these topicsSpaceSpaceXNasaInternational Space StationFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

As he spoke to the presenter Mark Chapman at 1pm, Hunt made no reference on air to the horrors he had endured.“I am thinking about the individuals who illuminate this sport,” he said. “Nothing else matters Mark. Galopin des Champs is the Antoine Dupont of horse racing. He has looked magnificent. His form is rock solid.”When Chapman reminded him that the first Gold Cup he called was won by the legendary Best Mate, 21 years ago, Hunt insisted that Galopin des Champs, who went on to finish second behind Inothewayurthinkin, was even better.“It really does take me back,” he said. “Everything about Best Mate was geared to Cheltenham. Galopin is even better than Best Mate. The weight of history can prove too heavy a toll and strange things can happen – he’s still got 22 fences ahead – but if he’s cherry ripe he will bring this home.”Chapman added: “And John will call them home as only John can.”In his powerful statement on Tuesday, Hunt insisted that he would fight on in memory of his family.“As you are consigned to a fate far greater than death, I can draw on the love and strength that I still feel from the girls in every moment of every day,” he said. “So whilst I am so badly damaged, I am determined to see what my future is, surrounded by so many amazing people.“And the chance to do this has been gifted to me by my incredible Hannah. I firmly believe that, had she not managed to show such amazing physical and mental strength in raising the alarm after you fatally injured her, then I would have been your fourth victim that day.He added: “Hannah handed me a second chance, one that she worked so hard to achieve for me. Do you really think after what she did for me, I will slight her memory and example by just giving up?”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

The notice demanded access to Apple’s Advanced Data Protection (ADP) service, which heavily encrypts personal data stored remotely in its servers.Apple refused and has challenged the order at the tribunal, which investigates whether the domestic intelligence services have acted unlawfully. Italso withdrew ADP from the UK last month, saying: “We have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.”ADP uses end-to-end encryption, which means only the account holder can decrypt the files. Messaging services such as iMessage and FaceTime remain end-to-end encrypted by default.The government’s secret legal demand is officially known as a technical capability notice. Recipients of a TCN cannot reveal the existence of an order unless they are given permission from the home secretary. The tribunal’s website states that hearings should be closed to the public only when “strictly necessary”, but itsrulesdeclare there must be no disclosure of information that is “prejudicial to national security”.On Thursday, a group of Democratic and Republican lawmakers in the UScalled on the tribunalto “remove the cloak of secrecy” around the UK government’s order and to make Friday’s hearing, as well as any further proceedings, public.Bloomberg reported on Thursday that British officials had initiated talks with their US counterparts over the order. The UK has reportedly assured the US that it is not seeking blanket access and would only seek data related to serious crimes such as terrorism and child sexual abuse.The Home Office has been asked for comment.Explore more on these topicsAppleEncryptionPrivacyHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

That would mean customer bills rising by far more thanthe 35% it has been allowed.Thames and a clutch of hedge funds lending it £3bn of high-interest debt have said new investors will walk away unless Ofwat grants huge allowances on costs. The company has claimed that otherwise their investment would be “pissed away” on fines and costs by the end of the decade, leaving it in the same parlous financial position, sources said.Thames is also trying to interfere with regulators handling itslegal challenge over customer bills, and has met Ofwat and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in recent days to try to persuade them to slow down their work on it to avoid spooking investors, the Guardian can reveal.The revelations underline the high-stakes negotiations to avert the collapse of Britain’s largest water company, with Labour desperate for a private sector solution to avoid the biggest unravelling of a Thatcher privatisation.Thames, which has 16 million customers and 8,000 employees acrossLondonand the Thames Valley, has been on the verge of collapse for months, hollowed out by years of dividend extraction, fines and huge borrowings, that have left it owing more than £19bn.Thames now needs to find new owners to pump cash into the business, with global investors including the Hong Kong-based CK Infrastructure and the private equity firm KKR among the potential bidders. They are expected to put £4-5bn of new money into the company, in return for a restructuring where lenders have to write off billions of pounds. Failure to secure a deal is likely to mean Thames falls into a form of temporary nationalisation called aspecial administration regime(SAR).Thames’s demand for a 59% increase in customers’ bills over the next five years was rejected by Ofwat in December,when it was given permission for a 35% increase instead.Thames last month appealed against that final determination, asking Ofwat to refer its decision to the CMA.As well as demanding forbearance on penalties, Thames has warned Ofwat and the CMA that bidders will be scared off and lose interest if the company is mired in a lengthy legal battle over how much it can raise bills by. It is instead asking for the regulator to sit on its referral to the CMA to see if it can secure a deal first.Senior Thames executives, including its chief executive, Chris Weston, and head of strategy, Cathryn Ross, have discussed the attempt to put the brakes on the appeal in recent days. Jefferies, the bank that represents some of the creditors, has also been involved in some of the discussions with Ofwat. David Burlison, a senior Jefferies banker, is leading this effort.However, delaying the regulatory process would be highly controversial, as it could be seen to give Thames preferential treatment.Southern Water, Anglian Water, South East Water, Northumbrian Water and Wessex Water have also asked the CMA tolet them raise bills by more than Ofwat has allowed. Thames’s referral to the CMA could mean their appeals are also affected.An Ofwat spokesperson said: “It is for Thames Water to raise the equity it needs and to make the operational improvements that are required for customers. Our turnaround oversight regime that was introduced last year, including an independent monitor, is in place to give us oversight of this. We expect to make formal referrals to the CMA shortly for companies requesting a CMA redetermination of their PR24 determination.”The CMA declined to comment.Ofwat sets bills for England and Wales over five-year periods. Its final settlement, covering 2025 to 2030, allowed water companies to raise average prices by 36% over five years from 1 April, before adding inflation. Ofwat said Thames can increase bills from £436 to £588, rejecting its demand for an increase to £667.Thames is understood to argue that without leniency on penalties for underperformance known as outcome delivery incentives, fines and other costs, new investors could be signing up for returns of just 0% to 0.5%. Rewriting its five-year spending plan would allow investors to get a return of 3%, it is understood to claim.It also wants customers to bear most of the cost of overspending. Thames wants to spend almost £24bn over the five-year period, compared with the £20.5bn that Ofwat is allowing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Ofwat’s “final determination” ruled that Thames should bear 60% of the cost of any overspend.Thames’s plan to spend £23.7bn over the next five years implies £3.2bn of overspending – meaning that about £2.9bn of overspending could be piled on to customers.Thames has consistently spent much more on overhauling its creaking Victorian network than Ofwat has allowed.An internal Thames document seen by the Guardian also shows it expects fines totalling £428m by March 2027. It could also face further fines for failings on environmental projects,revealed by the Guardian in December.There are also concerns that creditors, represented by Burlison at Jefferies, could be seen to be acting as shadow directors of Thames, given their intimate involvement in the restructuring talks and its strategy.Thames Water had said that it would run out of cash on 24 March without the £3bn debt lifeline,on which it will pay annual interest of 9.75%.Holders of “class A” debt, represented by Jefferies, include US hedge funds such as Elliott Management and Silver Point, as well as British investors including Aberdeen and M&G and will be owed about £19bn, once the £3bn of new debt is added on.The company and the creditors are desperate to avoid temporary nationalisation that could wipe out their investments. However, some politicians and campaigners argue that nationalisation would provide better value for taxpayers and customers.A spokesperson for the lenders said: “Thames Water’s class A creditors are focused on supporting the company to secure new equity capital and turning around its performance so that it delivers better outcomes for the environment and its customers as quickly as possible. This market-based solution would prevent temporary nationalisation of the company and taxpayers being on the hook for billions.”A Thames spokesperson said: “We have ongoing engagement with Ofwat as part of the recapitalisation process being undertaken.”Explore more on these topicsThames WaterUtilitiesWater industryLondonRegulatorsShareReuse this content"

I told Noel that he has my support because it is a lie.”Clarke’s libel claim relates to seven articles and a podcast published between April 2021 and March 2022 in which more than than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.GNM’s defence to the claim is that its reporting was true and also that it was in the public interest. Its defence includes witness statements alleging more details of misconduct by Clarke than were published by the Guardian in the articles and podcast that are the subject of the claim.Speaking about the wrap party, Dylan, whose credits include a 2009 TV adaption of Jane Austen’s Emma, told the court: “We all went out before the party to dinner and Davie was there. My boyfriend was there and there was a joke about me and Davie.“The wrap party, I don’t remember too well. I was probably there for an hour, Davie was around.“I don’t really recall Davie beyond that.“I was with my friend at the time. I don’t remember the specifics of the party other than we had a nice time.”Dylan was the third of four witnesses to give evidence in support of Clarke’s claim.More witnesses will give evidence for Clarke on Monday and then GNM will call its witnesses, including 26 people who will give testimony saying they were the victims of, or witnesses to, serious misconduct by the actor, or can “otherwise corroborate” the allegations.The court has heard that of those 26, 16 are women who claim they experienced Clarke’s misconduct first-hand, “some of them on multiple occasions”.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeLondonTelevision industryThe GuardianNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesNational newspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

The snap judgement I made in these moments was never from a place of harm or stealing a joey.“While I was unbelievably excited to see such an amazing animal, I looked it over quickly and immediately returned it to its mother. I ensured that the mother and joey did reunite, went off together, and that they got off the road.“I have done a great deal of reflection on this situation and have realized that I did not handle this situation as best as I should have … I have learned from this situation, and am truly sorry for the distress I have caused.”Attacking a young tourist over her treatment of a wombat is hypocritical – and misses the point | Georgie PurcellRead moreShe insisted that the incident had not simply been confected for content.“I want to make it absolutely clear that this was never about social media or getting likes.“This was not staged, nor was it done for entertainment. In my excitement and concern, I acted too quickly and then failed to provide necessary context to viewers online.”Burke, who is also the immigration minister, said on Thursday that he couldn’t “wait to see the back of this individual” and authorities were “working through the conditions” on Jones’s visa to determine “whether immigration law has been breached”.The Australian prime minister,Anthony Albanese, said Jones’s actions were “an outrage” and suggested she should try to “take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there”.RSCPA Australia said the footage showed a “blatant disregard” for native wildlife and the distress to the joey and the mother caused by the “callous act” was clear.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeAnimalsAustralian immigration and asylumSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

It was the first time a foreign army had occupied Russian land since the second world war.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin and army chief of staff Valery Gerasimov at a command post in Kursk on Wednesday.Photograph: Kremlin.ru/ReutersRussia, with the help of North Korean troops, has been pushing Ukrainian forces back, and in recent weeks the pressure on Ukrainian positions has become overwhelming. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin donned military fatigues to visit a command post in the region, and on Thursday, Russia announced it had regained full control of Sudzha.While Ukrainian troops continue to hold a few remaining villages in Kursk, soldiers involved in the operation said it was probably only a matter of time before the retreat was concluded.“The Russians are already pushing into Sumy region [in Ukraine], all the tasks now are defensive,” said Serhiy, a special operations commander who recently left the region.Map of Ukraine/Russia border zoneThe demand by Putin that troops create a “buffer zone” close to the border suggests a Russian offensive pushing back into Ukraine may be on the cards, and authorities have already evacuated several settlements close to the border.The end of the seven-month operation has led to mixed assessments in Ukraine, with some saying it achieved many of its goals, and others wondering if it was a distraction from the main war effort and cost Ukrainian lives for no tangible gain.“Kursk displaced the conflict on to Russian territory, and Russia used some of its best units to fight for it, but it also required a sizeable number of Ukraine’s elite units to hold the pocket,” said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Now, the Russian offensive may change the dynamic of the war again, at a moment when the US is pushing Moscow and Kyiv to sign a ceasefire agreement. “My worry is that this gives the Kremlin and the Russian army a new bout of enthusiasm and adrenaline,” the Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said.Theinitial incursion into Kurskhappened last August. It was planned by a very small circle to retain an element of surprise, and Kyiv did not even brief western allies until after the operation was under way. Troops arrived in nearby Sumy in small groups, and many stayed in rented apartments.View image in fullscreenUkrainian soldiers near the border with Russia at the beginning of the offensive.Photograph: Roman Pilipey/AFP/Getty ImagesDocuments recovered from Russian army positionsshowed that Moscow’s military planners had warned of the threat of an incursion for months, but when it came Ukrainian troops were able to overrun Russian positions, taking hundreds of prisoners of war.In Sudzha, officials and police fled without even destroying or taking away sensitive documents, leaving them for Ukrainian troops to seize and send to Kyiv for analysis.Those with knowledge of the planning say Ukrainian officials were taken aback by just how well the initial stage of the operation went, as Ukraine took control of about 500 sq miles within a few days.View image in fullscreenA destroyed Russian tank on a roadside near Sudzha in August 2024.Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/AP“At the beginning, the idea was just to create a diversion and to draw troops away from Donbas. But it went better than expected and suddenly we were digging in,” said one source.“We have no wish to occupy this territory,” Zelenskyy’s aide Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian in late August. “Our tasks are to push Russian artillery and other systems further away, destroy the warehouses and other military infrastructure that is there, and also to affect public opinion in Russia.”For the first time in the war, the shoe was on the other foot and Ukraine became an occupying power. The Ukrainian army took journalists on tours of Sudzha, where stunned residents could not believe the war they had seen on their television screens had arrived on Russian territory. A historian from Sumyrecorded a podcastin Sudzha’s small history museum, explaining how Sudzha and the rest of the region was historically Ukrainian land, a nod to Russian claims about Ukrainian territories.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The idea would have been to troll Russia, which masked its 2014 intervention in Donbas as the work of Ukrainian separatists. However, the plans were quickly discarded as unworkable and incendiary.The capture of hundreds of prisoners allowed Ukraine to offer an exchange for captured Ukrainians held in Russian jails, and the operation was also credited with providing a morale boost to Ukrainian troops and society after months of setbacks.View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian officer walking past cells holding Russian prisoners of war in August 2024.Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty ImagesThe longer Ukrainian troops held on to the land, the more it became clear that the endgame of the operation was now the chance to use Kursk as a card at future negotiations. Zelenskyytoldthe Guardian last month that Kyiv would “swap one territory for another”.However, as time went on, Russia upped the pressure on Ukrainian positions in the region. By the beginning of this year, Ukrainian military planners could see Russia making a sustained effort to concentrate forces on Kursk.View image in fullscreenRussian soldiers launch a BM-21 Grad rocket on the Kursk border in January 2025.Photograph: Russian Defence Ministry/EPA“Everything is going to Kursk,” one military source said in early February. “At the beginning they didn’t seem to pay that much attention to it, but then the North Koreans came, and then since the beginning of the year they are throwing everything at Kursk, perhaps to try to take it back before negotiating.”Some of Russia’s best drone units were relocated to the Kursk theatre. Because Ukrainian forces can use radio jammers to block Russian FPV (first person view) drones, Russia has increasingly begun using fibre optic drones, which unspool a thin cable over several miles and are immune to jammers.“The fields we are retreating through are like a spider’s web with all the fibre optic cables,” said Serhiy, the special operations commander.View image in fullscreenPeople queue outside a Red Cross tent in Sumy after a Russian drone attack in February.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesHe criticised the failure to build nets around the main road between Sumy and Sudzha to protect it from drones, as the Russians have done in part of the front in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. “Only in the last two weeks they started trying to do this, but now it’s too dangerous. They should have done it in September, October, when everything was calm,” he said.Ukrainian officials say that while ultimately the operation will not provide the hoped-for bargaining chip, it was able to change the narrative of the war, at a time when gloominess over Ukrainian prospects for any kind of advance had set in. They say that while the withdrawal may be fraught, it has so far passed without enormous loss of life or stubbornly holding on to undefendable positions.“After seven months, we simply withdrew. There was no encirclement,” said one senior security official, painting the operation as a success. “There were political goals, military goals, there was getting the Russians to move troops from Pokrovsk [in Donetsk] to Kursk. And we showed how shameful it is for the Russians, that they can’t fight Ukraine without North Koreans.”Others had a more mixed assessment, noting that the offensive stretched Ukraine’s already understaffed forces, and did not slow the Russian advance in the east. “Tactically it was successful, but the offensive changed little in the overall dynamic of this war, and failed to achieve its wider operational objectives,” Kofman said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That is just not helpful for anybody.”In his speech setting out civil service changes this week, Starmer hit out at “a cottage industry of blockers and checkers”, while acknowledging that previous governments had set up the state in such a way.Starmer also used an intervention in the Daily Telegraph to hit out at the “overcautious, flabby state”, while stressing that “the problem isn’t our fantastic civil servants – it’s the system they’re stuck in”.Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, said the “low point” for Starmer had been his description of civil servants as bathing in a “tepid bath” of managed decline, which he later softened by assuring officials he valued their work.“The Musk approach is not something that government should want to go anywhere near associating with itself and I think whoever has been going around briefing about ‘'project chainsaw’ should be retired from the comms efforts,” she said.Rutter said tackling poor performance in Whitehall would be a good thing and civil servants would be pleased he was railing against the system rather than the quality of their work. But she said: “He could have had more substance behind the rhetoric and an action plan.”Civil service union leaders have also objected to the prime minister’s tone. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, said: “Blaming public servants for doing the job they were tasked with by ministers is just cheap politics and is increasingly following a pattern where the government appears more interested in headlines than leadership.”Starmer’s language has been praised by the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a thinktank that was closely associated with Liz Truss.Tom Clougherty, the executive director of the IEA, said: “Increasingly, the government is getting its rhetoric right. But its actions haven’t quite caught up. The British state is overloaded and that hurts both public services and the private sector. Changing structures might help, but ultimately government just needs to stop doing some things altogether.”Starmer’s shift to using more robust language has increased in his eight months as prime minister. He said he would “build, baby, build” to meet his pledge on more housing, channelling Trump’s mantra of “drill, baby, drill”.The prime minister also declared he would not tolerate building projects held up by excessive consideration for newts or bat tunnels, pledging to tackle environmental obstacles.While Starmer comes from the opposite side of the political spectrum to Trump, some in Downing Street have been struck by the sense of energy around attempted changes in the US – even if the aims are different.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, told LBC: “We’re different political traditions, but I think we’ve all been struck by the pace at which President Trump’s new administration has come in and made a whole bunch of changes to the way that Washington and the way that government works.“We might look at some of those changes and think, well, they’re not quite the changes we would make, from a centre-left perspective, but the speed at which they’ve operated, we’ve actually thought, you know what, we can go further and faster. We will, we are. That’s what the prime minister’s doing.”Asked about criticisms of Starmer’s language, the prime minister’s deputy spokesperson said he was focused on “an active, agile and productive state that works for working people”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He appears mainly to be referring to regulators and quangos telling ministers their plans are difficult to implement or problematic.‘The absurd spectacle of a £100m bat tunnel’The prime minister blamed bat tunnels for holding up planning processes, including HS2, as their protected nature means they often have to be considered before construction is approved. Angela Rayner has also said newts should not be considered more important than people, in the vein of Boris Johnson, who previously criticised “newt counting delays”.‘Flabby’ and ‘bloated’ civil serviceStarmer said the civil service had got too big and unwieldy, although he stresses that he is not interested in ideological arguments about its size. He is overseeing tens of thousands of job cuts among public officials.‘Build, baby, build’Last month, the prime minister used Trumpian language as he pledged to make it easier to construct mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales. Starmer told the BBC the government was going to “take on the blockers”.‘Smash the gangs’Starmer has long used forthright language to talk of his desire to stop people-smuggling across the Channel. The gangs do not appear to have been smashed yet, with 4,000 people arriving in small boats so far this year.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerCivil serviceLabourElon MuskDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

While I’d like to argue that there’s been a lot to cover so far in 2024 –The Oscars,The Traitors, dead-eyed celebs trying toconvince us of the merits of AI– it does feel like a bit of an oversight. Because in this second season, Severance seems to have become a stealth cultural juggernaut.Such terms are nebulous of course, particularly when it’s harder than ever to determine how popular anything is. Apple have claimed that Severance is itsmost-watched show ever, overtakingTed Lasso,which is no mean feat - although, as ever with the streamers, actual tangible numerical data for these claims is hardly forthcoming. But Severance has also performed strongly in Nielsen’s (again somewhat contested) ratings for original shows on streaming, routinely appearing in the Top 10 – a rare speck of the gunmetal grey of Apple’s logo in a sea of Netflix red.And in that more ambient sense of “popularity”, Severance is triumphing. It’s the subject of endless audience fascination, measured in think pieces,innie/outie memes, Reddit threads orfan visits to the real-life settingof the show’s shadowy corporation, Lumon. It’s definitely the show that people currently seem to be expending the most energy discussing and thinking about. The only other contender in that regard isThe White Lotus– though I’d argue that much of the energy being expended on The White Lotus is in complaining that the show’s third season isn’t as good as the first two.View image in fullscreenPatricia Arquette with Britt Lower in the background in Severance.Photograph: Apple TV +Even those of us who were Severance supporters from day one, who joined on the ground floor of the Lumon lift, didn’t see this coming. Severance felt – like so many series made in the streaming age (particularly those made by Apple) – perfectly placed to be watched by a handful of true believers and then quietly cancelled after a couple of seasons. Its work brain/home brain bifurcation concept, as anyone who has tried to explain it to friends down the pub knows, is hard to pin down; it unfurls slowly, and has the sort of offbeat, deadpan tone that feels likely to turn off as many people as it engages. Thethree-year gap between seasons– ample time for people to forget its plot points, not to mention why they liked it in the first place – could hardly help either.What I underestimated was Severance’s ability to appeal to completely different audiences at the same time. There’s the puzzle box mystery crowd, of course, the people on forums feverishlyspeculating about goat symbolismand whatexactly goes on in the elevator, but –unlike, say, Westworld – it’s light enough on the lore for anyone not willing to go fully down the rabbit hole to engage with. And the fact that the show is so thick with ideas means that different cohorts engage with different aspects of it: the politically minded, enjoying its satirical skewering of corporate America; the psychoanalysts,drawing parallels with Jungian theory; the religious allegory types, considering what itsays about MormonismorJesus, or cultish behaviour; the people intrigued by what it has to say about ourrelationship with the officein the 21st century; or those simply fascinated by itsretrofuturistic design(andwondering where they can buy that lampshade).Managing to serve so many different constituencies is quite an achievement, one that I think has been reached, rather counterintuitively, by a lack of pandering. This is about as far from a show created by committee as you can get: funky and weird and slightly obscure. It makes creative decisions that would cause an AI-scriptwriting bot to malfunction –waffle parties, say, orentire episodes set in a frosty wilderness, about as far away from the comforting green baize of the Lumon office as possible. That capacity to go off-piste, married with a willingness to actually provide answers and push the plot forward, is reassuring: it suggests that Severance’s creative team know what they’re doing.Still, it’s a high-wire act of a show to pull off, and season two hasn’t been perfect. There have been points where, in expanding its wider world and deepening its mystery, Severance has neglected its core quartet a little, with too few scenes of the innies bickering and bonding in the office, one of the great low-key charms of season one. This time around, occasionally the characters can feel less like fully breathing people than plot facilitators: we’ve had too little of Helly R (still performed with a superb mix of naivety, anguish and gen X ironic detachment by Britt Lower), with the show more interested in the machinations of her outie, Helena Eagan.I’d chalk this up to second season growing pains though, and for the most part Severance is still as peculiar, thought-provoking and compelling as ever. And, as with season one, next week’s finale is a marmalade-dropper: tense and stuffed with big revelations, and containing (for my money) the single best scene in the show’s history. It’s a scene that, for all the talk about thehuge amount spent on each episode, is brilliantly economical: just two characters (I won’t tell you who!) discussing the strange circumstances they find themselves in and what it means for their sense of self. As with all Severance’s best moments, it’s stuffed full of ideas – a huge reason that people keep coming back to this peculiarly popular show.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That was Estonian novelist Robert Kurvitz, part of a team who had just started work on an esoteric video game about an alcoholic cop trying to solve a murder in an impoverished region of a war-torn country. The game was Disco Elysium, now regarded as one of the all-time great cerebral role-playing games: released in 2019, it sat atop PC Gamer’s top 100 list for four years in a row.Kurvitz is a Sea Power superfan. Pick a random scene from the game and there’ll be something – a bit of dialogue, a location, a theme – that has some sort of Sea Power reference in it. Wilkinson tells me that Kurvitz was “captivating and full of a bubbling passion” and that he knew an unsettling number of “strange details about our music”. Kurvitz had already embedded some of those “very obscure” Sea Power references in the world of Disco Elysium before they had even met. Whether the band liked it or not, they were already enmeshed in this eccentric Estonian’s world.“[Disco Elysium] seemed both separate, and also sympathetic to, the band’s identity,” Wilkinson reflects. “It was a strange, fucked up, sci-fi existence parallel to the one we were inhabiting … Kurvitz seemed to mythologise the mundane.”View image in fullscreenMythologising the mundane … Disco Elysium.Photograph: ZA/UMThe game is about the perennial pull between fascism and communism; police violence; the importance of community in the face of state oppression; alcoholism; homosexuality; the politics of poverty; and a tiny, pixel-sized hole in reality. It suited Sea Power down to the ground. The band, after all, had been writing music about the slow, perilous collapse of the planet as ice shelves slid into the ocean. There had been sombre, reflective, tracks about obscure bodies of water in Orkney. They’d waxed lyrical about the virtues of being an EU citizen (pre-Brexit, naturally). The band have always embraced the miserable alongside the beautiful. Wilkinson is particularly complimentary of the game’s “strange sense of humour”, something he thinks resonated with the band – and their fans.The initial meeting between took place in Birmingham. “Birmingham is a strange place. Its own world. Very strong in character,” reflects Wilkinson. “Maybe [Kurvitz] had been to Alan Moore for a magical blessing? [To meet us] in the spiritual home of heavy metal and Tolkien’s inspiration for the Shire … it seems oddly fitting, I suppose, now that I look back. I had never thought about that until now.”Sea Power, new to the world of video games, took direction from Kurvitz, caught in the tidal pool of his vision for most of the project. Wilkinson tells me that Kurvitz had a plan, and “a fastidious knowledge of our albums and rare EPs and B-sides”. As such, many of the songs in the game come from pre-existing Sea Power tracks, reworked, remixed, and re-recorded to coalesce with the watercolour weariness that defines Disco Elysium’s fading world.View image in fullscreenThe game’s ‘thought cabinet’ … cover art for Disco Elysium’s soundtrack.Illustration: ZA/UM“Thinking about it, some of the tracks we used on the game continued their existence into our following album,” Wilkinson says. “So working on the game not only drew from our past but influenced our future, too.”Disco Elysium’s songs are stripped down, exposing the core melodies, and a little bit less dense than what you’d hear on a standard Sea Power album. There are fewer vocal melodies and longer, dreamier sequences. Any explicit narrative is stripped away, and you’re left with a soundscape, a Turner painting as a song. “Generally, songs needed distilling down to a fundamental mood fitting the scene, doing away with anything which was in competition with that mood and usually adding a little dreamy liminal menace,” Wilkinson says.“There is so much dialogue, and the visuals do so much, so the music really just needed to reach into the subconscious and open the gates of the mind, allowing the brain to absorb the words and images and help them become totally immersive. And that was enjoyable, artistically, to do … I love creating atmospheres and sonic textures as much as writing choruses or words. Maybe more, sometimes.”Sea Power have also worked on film soundtracks, rescoring a 1934 Irish fictional documentary called Man of Aran – an experience that helped Wilkinson know what to expect from creating a game soundtrack, even if there were some key differences.“Games are a little more easygoing with regards to timing,” he says. “With film, it’s often important to hit cues and you know exactly when different moods need to change direction. It can be more mathematical. The game needed more general mood textures to sit behind scenes, and blend into and enhance the feeling of various parts of the world. I would definitely work on more games. I love games like Disco Elysium, although they are a very rare thing.”This spring, Sea Power are embarking on a mini tour named Soundtracks Live. The set will feature various Disco Elysium songs, work from the Man of Aran soundtrack, and various tracks from another documentary feature film, From the Sea to the Land Beyond. Wilkinson is excited about the prospect of performing these tracks live – especially for an audience of Disco Elysium fans.View image in fullscreen‘The game needed general mood textures to sit behind scenes’ … Disco Elysium.Photograph: ZA/UM“We have had a noticeable growth in listeners since [the game was released],” he says. “They seem like a cool and thoughtful bunch, these Disco Elysium players. They are appreciated. The odd drunken detective has been sighted along the crash barrier at gigs.”The relationship between Disco Elysium and Sea Power has been symbiotic; they have given new life to each other. Sea Power have seen a swell in listeners as a result of the game, and existing Sea Power fans discovered a new love for video games as a result of the collaboration. And the relationship is still evolving.“On our first meeting, [Kurvitz] did tell me that he had worked very hard on re-ordering the track list to our album Valhalla Dancehall,” smiles Wilkinson. “Hmm, Valhalla Dancehall, Disco Elysium … could there be a link of some kind?” The band are now considering this revised track list for the album’s anniversary reissue. “He is very talented and intelligent. So are all the game’s core creators. I don’t think many people notice all the little nods to the world of Sea Power through the game. It was strange when it became such a huge hit around the world, and we were proud to be a part of its story.“And, of course,” he nods, “we got a Bafta out of it, too, which would have been unlikely to happen to us otherwise.”Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is available now on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Now one English institution has found its own way of signifying a flagship moment while interrogating its past – a blue dress.The new artwork, at Manchester Art Gallery, commemorates the occasion when the African American abolitionistSarah Parker Remondmade a speech on the site in 1859.Inspired by the silhouette of an outfit Parker Remond wore, the dress links stories from the African, American and European continents in its detailing, exploring Manchester’s links to slavery through visual metaphor.The common thread is cotton –the commodity linking Victorian Manchester’s emergence as an industrial powerhouse with the transatlantic trade in people, a connection that came under greater examination in the city after 2020’s Black Lives Matter protests.Unveiled this week, the Victorian-style gown – complete with petticoat, corset, pantaloons, chemise and crinoline – is the work of the artist Holly Graham, who said she wanted to bring Parker Remond’s “voice back into the space” where it was heard more than 165 years ago.Graham collaborated with her mother, the stage and screen costumier Jennifer Graham, and was assisted by researchers to create the dress for the exhibition The Warp/ The Weft/ The Wake.The dress’s print references the marbled endpapers of the subscriber logbooks of the Royal Manchester Institution (RMI), 1823’s forerunner organisation to Manchester Art Gallery, whose benefactors included members ofthe Greg family, of Cheshire’s Quarry Bank Mill, who enslaved people in Dominica.“I was thinking about how abolitionist histories are championed in British cultural memory, but without always confronting why those principles were needed in the first place,” Graham said.View image in fullscreenThe dress on display at Manchester Art Gallery.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe artwork also takes inspiration from rare, archive samples of “Guinea cloth”, also known as Manchester check, a fabric produced for west African markets in the“triangular trade”in people and goods.“I was interested in the resemblance of the check print to the grid that bound the names of the RMI subscribers in the institution’s ledgers, to highlight the names of those whose money was assigned to the founding of the institution, but also the names that are not included … those whose labour facilitates the wealth that was invested in the institution,” Graham said.Parker Remond travelled to England in the late 1850s to urge mill owners and workers to support abolition in the United States, and then to support theUnion blockadeagainst plantation owners of the American south.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I ask you, raise the moral public opinion until its voice reaches the American shores … until the shackles of the American slave melt like dew before the morning sun. I ask especial help from the women of England. Women are the worst victims of the slave power.”While Manchester boomed during a cotton trade from which “not one cent”, as Parker Remond reminded her audience, reached enslaved labourers, the city was also a centre of abolitionist sentiment. The anti-slavery campaigner Richard Cobden was a founder of the Manchester Athenaeum, where the African American statesman and writerFrederick Douglassalso lectured.Inbal Livne, a senior creative lead at Manchester City Galleries, said: “ManchesterArtGallery is a central part of the city’s complex history. Holly Graham’s work provides an exciting opportunity to link empire, colonialism and exploitation of the past with real and immediate concerns of the present around representation, racism and power.”Both Parker Remond and Douglass were featured as part of the Guardian’s Cotton Capital series. The series launched with the Scott Trust Legacies of Enslavement programme, a 10-year restorative justice initiative launched in March 2023 in response to theGuardian founders’ connectionsto transatlantic enslavement.Holly Graham: The Warp/ The Weft/ The Wakeis at Manchester Art Gallery until 15 March 2026Explore more on these topicsHeritageCotton Capital: ongoing seriesMuseumsArtManchesterSlaveryEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Maybe if you squinted a bit, or just heard the vowel sounds. Perhaps if you’ve already performed some kind of ad hoc self-lobotomy using a chisel made from cheddar cheese, pork pie meat and fear. Maybe then, maybe then.But also perhaps not, because Thomas Tuchel’s first squad conference was in the event a highly convincing production, expertly phrased, and hitting just the right note of hope versus realism. So yeah. Good luck with that. How far can we go with this? Because as ever the dynamic remains the same, an appointment to this strange semi-sporting role that will tell us a great deal more about England than the latest smiling man in front of the boards covered in adverts.Jordan Henderson? Tuchel raises eyebrows as he gets to workRead moreThere were some notes of interest in the squad selection.Jordan Henderson you say? Finally, we’re ready to move on and take that final step. But mainly this was a fluent, quietly spiky reminder that this is just a matter of managing talent, that Tuchel is a supremely bright anglophile and a logical choice in many ways, if not in every way. And above all that he has a shot here at actually making this work.Best of all was the keynote, hit with reassuring certainty: it all felt very Premier League. Here is a well-briefed European man talking about football. This has to be the right way to go for the current 18-month mission. Modernise, internationalise. Represent the league English football has given the world, not the one it wishes it had.For now it was a fascinating process just taking in the new set of visual cues. After seven years of Southgate energy, after Lee Carsley’s enjoyably twinkly garden gnome in yoga pants act,here is a new thing, new toy, a new set of lines and sounds. What is it? Is it good? How can we ruin it?The first impressions were crisp and moreish. Tuchel is all jaw, cheekbones, boggly eyes, restless intelligence, sitting there in fitted black knitwear looking like a heroic wartime submariner explaining nuclear fusion to a room full of potentially tricky mid-ranking officers.He spoke really well. He dodged the obvious fault lines, and even got in some snappy passive‑aggressive comebacks. But then, for all the stuff about bloodlines, about inexplicably wanting to see his children in Germany sometimes, about the imaginary lineup of English coaches ready to fill the role, this is a good and measured appointment.Tuchel is the firstEnglandmanager to have worked in the league and won the European Cup. He’s more or less a continuity choice when it comes to the pathway DNA stuff, if only because that text was cobbled together out of pretty much all modern coaching methods. He brings some actual knowledge of how to win big games when the world is shouting at you.And yes, there is a subtext to all these early sessions. The England job drives people mad. First the ones around the edge. Eventually the person in the centre. How will Tuchel go insane? Which personal characteristic will be picked out and magnified by all that heat?Roy Hodgson ended up tieless and sleepless in Nice, muttering about logistics, blinking like some casino-lounge vampire. Gareth Southgate was steadily pared back, from garrulous wedding guest to parched and desiccated frontier preacher. Fabio Capello entered and left the job as a mute and angry waxwork.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel talked about emotions, values, love and building a brotherhood in his first serious engagement for England.Photograph: Josh Smith/PPAUK/ShutterstockHow will they go for Tuchel? Will it be the football? Too slow, too complex? Will it be going back to Germany on holiday? Long distance Tom. Tommy T’s day off. Loopy Tom the mad professor. Herr today gone tomorrow. Bad to Wurst. For you Tommy the World Cup is over.Or maybe none of these. Because Tuchel was pretty good in his first serious engagement. His word cloud was varied and engaging. He talked about emotions, values, love, building a brotherhood.

I can assure you that the talks in the last days and weeks had a parental vibe.” At which point one obvious point presents itself. Can we just clear it up. Tuchel’s English is more sophisticated than anything on show in the newspaper columns accusing him of not being able to speak the language.Wary and well-briefed, he skipped across some obvious traps. Yes, he was proud and honoured be the first German manager of England. He refused flat out to answer a question in German. Are you insane? He dropped in – casual flex – that he knows Prince William, banters with him about Aston Villa, and has been to Windsor Castle. Tuchel even looks like a surprisingly successful royal cousin, the ears, the hairline, the bones. Is this enough England?There was no mention of the ghost at the table, Sir Gareth, although there was something in Tuchel’s talk about style. We will play to the Premier league template, he insisted, an excellent response because this means nothing and everything. Maresca? Or Moyes? But it is right to speak about intensity and physicality. Who doesn’t like those? It is also probably a good point. If England had played like an assertive Premier League team in those finals they might have won one of them. This feels like something Tuchel may actually be able to add.Otherwise, the squad is good. Dan Burn is a populist choice. This is Tuchel’s independence for the Bank of England moment, his budget giveaways. And there will be a honeymoon period here, as news media and front pages cotton on to the fact that he’s eloquent, handsome and charming. Although this will have to happen in hyper‑quick mode because this is of course a win-things-now gambit.There is a slight paradox here. Is Tuchel really some kind of up‑and‑coming serial winner? For a while he had a reputation for almost winning things. The last time he managed a team for a whole season and won a meaningful trophy was five years ago at Paris Saint-Germain. He has also never been involved in a game of international football as coach or player. Is this going to work? Is there even any notion of what working is, given the general delusion over the level of English players, and the fact it seems only winning the World Cup will now be considered success?For now it seems likely Tuchel will start well, will capture some refreshing new energy, out there in his skinny-legged slacks, saying amusing things in press conferences. England will do quite well next year. But the home Euros in 2028 still feels a more realistic prospect.For now, here it is, coming around again, another voyage into the storm, another doomed love affair; underpinned this time by a different kind of competence, a different accent, and one or two odd notes in the weeks to come with the usual stuff about bombers and Great Escapes. For now, just get on the bus, Thomas. Don’t let them trip you up. And as we say around here, Good Luck.Explore more on these topicsThomas TuchelEnglandanalysisShareReuse this content"

Here is our roundup of some of the takeaways from this year’s fair, and a taste of the books we can expect to see in shops in the near future.Festival fundingIn case you missed last summer’s festival funding fiasco: fund manager Baillie Gifford came under fire for its investments in fossil fuels and companies linked to Israel, which resulted in partnerships between the firm andnine literary festivals it sponsoredbeing cut. At this week’s fair, English PEN made the bold but much-needed move to get the stakeholders in the same room at the same time.A representative of the campaign group Fossil Free Books, Jessica Gaitán Johannesson, said that its members had seen an opportunity to make a difference and protest injustices that many of them had written about. However, Fiona Razvi, the director of Wimbledon BookFest – which had previously been sponsored by Baillie Gifford – said that “attacking an investment company which passed our scrutiny, which we were very happy with – they were a force for good, as far as I can see, in our industry – I’m not so sure that was the right way”, to loud applause.Book-to-screen adaptationsIt feels like an exciting time for book-to-screen adaptations, with The Thursday Murder Club and Guillermo del Toro’s version of Frankenstein among many other much-anticipated films in the works. Indeed, films based on books typicallydo significantly betterat the box office than those with original screenplays. The challenge of turning novels into films and series went under the microscope at this year’s fair, with authors and producers each pulling back the curtain on the obstacle-ridden process. Lucy Clarke, whose book The Castaways was turned into a hit series for Paramount+, said that she never writes specifically for screen, but “obviously there’s that lovely glittery hope that maybe it’ll get picked up”.RomanceLove was in the air at the fair, with a spate of new acquisitions in the romance and romance-adjacent space: Tess Sharpe’s romance-action thriller No Body No Crime; a three-book series by BookTok star Tierney Page; Patrick Ness’s novel Meridian; and Remain, a romantic thriller from Nicholas Sparks and M Night Shyamalan. Plus, queen of romantasy Rebecca Yarros will have her blockbuster Empyrean books, beginning with Fourth Wing, adapted into a six-part graphic novel series. “There is something so special about seeing your words come to life through art,” she said.Contentious classicsWhat should publishers do with classic books containing offensive language or ideas? They might include footnotes or an introduction by a contemporary author to add context. Or they might decide the text isn’t worth publishing any more.Children are handed classics and told “this is something that you must revere, this is something you must value”, said Aimée Felone, managing director of children’s publisher Knights Of. Yet, a “classic” is a “socially constructed” thing, said Maria Bedford, editorial director at Scribe. Whether or not to continue publishing problematic work by historically admired authors is a nuanced, ever-changing conversation that publishers are still working out how to have, the fair’s panel made clear.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Rights groups say that up to 30,000 people were killed in Duterte’s “war on drugs”.To some, Duterte’s arrest this week came as a shock. But for years many brave Filipinos, from priests, politicians and pathologists to journalists and relatives of the victims, have worked tirelessly – in and out of the spotlight – to expose the horrors of the deadly campaign and collect enough evidence to hold Duterte to account, first at home and now at the international criminal court, where he will make his first appearance on Friday.Here are some of the key people that played a role.Flaviano Villanueva: the outspoken Catholic priestView image in fullscreenFlaviano Villanueva blesses the tomb of Lome Codilla, a victim of an alleged extrajudicial killing five years ago.Photograph: Ezra Acayan/Getty ImagesA key figure in the movement to bring Duterte to justice was Fr Flaviano, one of several Filipino priests who were deeply critical of the drug wars. At times when the families of victims were too scared to speak out, the church provided an important source of refuge and support, and over the years encouraged witnesses and families to tell their stories. Flaviano, in tandem with the forensic pathologist Dr Raquel Fortun, also worked to collect evidence of the extrajudicial killings that could one day be used in court.His initiative Project Arise enabled the bodies of the victims, with their families’ permission, to be exhumed from temporary graves and cremated, and then placed in a more permanent location. In the interim Fortun collected evidence about the causes of death, which regularly conflicted with the official account. Flaviano said the work allowed them “to discover systematic patterns on the kind of modus operandi the police and the killers were using in order to eliminate their target”.Asked about how he felt about Duterte’s arrest, the priest told the Guardian he was elated. “This is the feeling of victory that the widows and myself have been simply dreaming of,” he said. “It’s like what scripture says about the people who have walked in darkness all their lives, and have finally seen a great light, a great hope has been revealed to us.”Raquel Fortun: the forensic pathologist who re-examined the deadView image in fullscreenThe forensic pathologist Raquel Fortun examines the exhumed remains of Constantino de Juan in a morgue at the University of the Philippines.Photograph: Eloisa Lopez/ReutersRaquel Fortun’s investigation into the “war on drugs” began in quite unlikely circumstances. It was 2021, and about five years had passed since Duterte had launched his crackdown. Many of thefamilies of those killed, who had only been able to afford short leases on graves, were increasingly facing having the remains of their loved ones evicted from cemeteries.Through Flaviano’s Project Arise, Fortun, one of only two forensic pathologists in the country, offered families the chance for the remains to be properly examined. She set up a table in the stockroom of her department at the University of thePhilippines, and began work. She found frequent and serious irregularities in how postmortems were performed – death certificates that wrongly attributed fatalities to natural causes or bullets left untouched in victims’ bodies. Her work has added to a body of evidence contradicting the claims of the authorities.Leila de Lima: the gutsy senatorView image in fullscreenSenator Leila de Lima said she knew the truth would eventually be exposed.Photograph: Bullit Marquez/APLeila de Lima was one of the few politicians who dared to speak out against Duterte and his “war on drugs”. As the then chair of the Senate committee on justice and human rights, she began an inquiry into the killings. De Lima paid a high cost for taking up that challenge. Duterte responded by seeking to publicly humiliate her, and she was eventually jailed for more than six years on baseless charges, the last of which was finally dropped in 2024.Speaking to theGuardian in December, De Lima said she knew the truth would eventually be exposed, and that she expected an arrest warrant could be issued imminently. “I knew that eventually, truth would prevail, and that is what is happening now,” she said. “Witnesses are coming out, not any more scared, telling the people, telling their testimony, what they knew about Duterte’s ‘war on drugs’.”Commenting after Duterte’s arrest this week, De Lima said in a statement: “To those who have fought this long and difficult fight – your voices mattered, your courage mattered, and today, the pursuit of justice continues.”Randy delos Santos: a bereaved uncle who fought for justiceView image in fullscreenRandy delos Santos, a volunteer with Program Paghilom, a group helping relatives of victims of Duterte’s ‘war on drugs’, places an urn containing the ashes of a victim on its final resting place during a funeral ceremony at a cemetery in Manila the day after Duterte’s arrest.Photograph: Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Tuesday morning Randy delos Santos’s phone began flashing with messages saying that police, Interpol and justice department officials were at the airport in Manila, ready to arrest Duterte. “I stopped what I was doing immediately to check the news online,” he said. “[I asked myself] Is it true, or am I dreaming?”It was true – Duterte had been taken into custody. Delos Santos went to church to meet other families and the media. He cried, overwhelmed with emotion. “It felt as if my body was becoming numb,” he said. “This is a new chapter of hope for us.”More than six years have passed since his nephew, Kian delos Santos, 17, was shot dead during Duterte’s anti-drugs crackdown. Kian was found dead in a dark alley near his home in Caloocan City, bent in a foetal position with a gun in his hand.Police claimed that Kian had shot at them and they acted in self-defence, a common claim made by the authorities at the time. Kian’s death prompted unprecedented public outrage and protests, and it was one of just a handful of cases that led to convictions. But even in a case as high profile as Kian’s, securing justice was an uphill battle for his family. “The burden is on us to look for physical evidence and testimonies,” Delos Santos said.There were times when Delos Santos ate fried banana for dinner because he had spent all his money paying for transport to court. After Kian’s death Delos Santos began working for the Arnold Janssen Kalinga Foundation, founded by Flaviano, supporting other families whose loved ones had been killed. Many were too afraid to speak out, fearing retaliation. Delos Santos has given evidence to the ICC investigation and says he would do so again if needed.He hopes the court will not stop at Duterte and will hold other high-ranking officials to account. “I hope they continue to go after and hold accountable those who have become abusive of their power,” he said.He has forgiven Duterte, he added. “But he needs to face [the charges] and be accountable for the sin he committed – for the country, not just for Kian.”Raffy Lerma: one of the ‘night crawlers’The Filipino photographer Raffy Lerma knew something had changed when he covered one of the first killings during the early days of Duterte’s drug war. “I remember the first crime scene I went to. I knew that night something was different. Why? I remember one reaction was that people were cursing them [the victims], saying they deserved to die … For me that was the start,” he recalled. “There was no empathy and I knew something had changed.”Photographers such as Lerma, assigned to the night shift, were tasked with covering the grisly murders that occurred in the middle of the night – in the early days sometimes multiple times a night. The collective group of photographers have since been called the “night crawlers”. One image that Lerma took, shot in July 2016, featuring a woman cradling her partner after being shot dead by motorcycle-riding gunmen, encapsulates the horror of that time.Despite the wave of killings, Duterte commanded widespread popularity at the start of his presidency, and with a flood of fake news, some denied the magnitude of the deaths. Lerma says the work of photographers and journalists helped counter the flood of misinformation and expose the reality on the ground. “It gave the official evidence it was happening,” he said. When Filipinos questioned whether the killings were occurring, “I showed my photographs, I told them, you cannot deny, I saw this. And these are my photographs to prove it. I was there.”Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesRodrigo DuterteAsia PacificDrugs tradeInternational criminal courtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It gets delivered in zero-plastic packaging and works out cheaper than going to the supermarket as you don’t have to pay extra for postage. The grapefruit fragrance smells much nicer than the big brands, too.TrishWe switched to Smol products, which contain zero plastic. We buy dishwasher tablets, washing machine capsules, fabric conditioner, wiping-up sponges, kitchen surface spray and foaming hand wash, all delivered in cardboard boxes at no extra cost. We’ve saved a lot of single-use plastic by doing this.

We moved over to drinking sparkling water last year and saw our single-use plastic bottle usage rise. Argh! So, for Christmas, we bought an Aarke carbonator. No more single-use plastic. The machine looks gorgeous on the worktop, it’s easy to use, I like its eco credentials (its gas cylinders use100% renewable CO2, a byproduct from agricultural and chemical production)and we now never run out of sparkling water. Very happy!Patricia O’ConnorMetal water bottleView image in fullscreenChilly’s insulated drinks bottle, 500ml£24 at John Lewis£24 at Chilly’sA few years ago, I became obsessed with the idea that drinking more water would improve my skin.

Tired with single-use tampons and uncomfortable sanitary towels, one by one we made the switch. You don’t normally get to wear your fancy pants on your period, but my black Modibodi briefs might actually be the most flattering pair of pants I own. If you’re still on the fence, M&S do a great multipack that’s much more affordable.Ella JinaduEcowashing-upView image in fullscreenStainless steel washing-up bowl 31cm£23.99 at Robert Dyas£27.49 at B&QView image in fullscreenSeep all-purposebamboo cloths£2.86 each at Robert Dyas£8.95 for three at Bower CollectiveView image in fullscreenWooden dish brush with replaceable head£5.99 at Bower Collective£6.50 at Wild & StoneMy washing-up bowl is now stainless steel; I buy bamboo dish cloths and use wooden brushes to wash up.

Partly because the one I use is sulphate-free, and partly because you can use it to the very end, unlike a bottle. And when you fly, it’s one less liquid to squeeze through security.I also buy everything refill – we have a great local shop calledCups and Jars(andRefillis a great source of local refill shops) – and store everything in old chickpea jars (we eat a lot) instead of plastic click-clacks.Morwenna FerrierGlass bottle cleaning productsView image in fullscreenPurdy & Figg counter cleaner starter kit£15 at Purdy & FiggI’ve started using Purdy & Figg cleaning products on subscription.

At home, my favourite item is a coconut-fibre dish brush to replace those plastic ones. Better, cleaner, doesn’t go manky. Other things? Refilling household cleaning products – those bottles are WAY too good to chuck. We’ve had some being refilled for nearly six years now.Lindsay SinghHomemade yoghurtView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AlexPro9500/Getty Images/iStockphotoI started making my own dairy-free yoghurt a few years ago. I reckon I’ve avoided at least 500 large plastic pots, as well as unnecessary additives. I use pure soy milk (Sojadeseems best), a handful of ground-up cashews and a couple of tablespoons of a previous batch as a starter. You can start your first batch with shop-bought live yoghurt. I used to keep it warm for four hours in a padded coat but now use my multi-cooker.

The first is a consistent sense of jeopardy from start to finish and the second isa level of entertainmentthat elevates the tournament into the mainstream consciousness. Whenboth occur simultaneously, as they have done this year, the championship’s final round ranks among the most gripping days in modern team sport.This particular “Super Saturday” certainly has all the necessary spicy ingredients, starting with the prospect of France’s second title since 2010 if they can beat Scotland in Paris. A bonus-point win for England over Wales in Cardiff, though, could yet be enough to sneak the trophy in the event of a breathless Scotland win. Which, from a Scottish perspective, looms as the ultimate catch-22 scenario.Ireland, too, are still just about in contention but will need to win well in Italy and hope both France and England subsequently underperform to nip in and claim a third consecutive title. With Wales also desperate to sidestep a 17th consecutive Test defeat and a second successiveSix Nationswooden spoon, there is even more of a “Judgment Day” feel to the triple-header of fixtures than normal.England must be ruthless against Wales – and that is the blueprint for the future | Ugo MonyeRead moreIf the evidence so far this year is any guide, not everything will go entirely to plan. France are now being hailed as the best thing since sliced croissants but didn’t they justlose to a previously hangdog Englandlast month? Shouldn’t Scotland have beaten England at Twickenham? Scotland’s record against France under Gregor Townsend is also pretty decent, with five wins in 12 meetings during his coaching tenure.And since when did the sight of a white jersey and a red rose not stir the blood in a pre-match Welsh dressing room? To be in Wales this week has also been to detect some fresh belief under their impressive interim coach Matt Sherratt. Even without Maro Itoje conducting his pre-game media address in the Roald Dahl suite at England’s Cardiff hotel the potential always exists for a few tales of the unexpected.On top of everything else the tournament is also about to see the creation of a record. A mere seven more tries will make the 2025 championship the highest-scoring in history, eclipsing the current record aggregate of 91 set in 2023. France, should they manage four tries against Scotland, will also beat England’s longstanding record of 29 tries in a single Six Nations tournament, set way back in 2001.That statistic alone marks this French side out as something special, such has been the improvement in defensive organisation over the past two decades. The new law requiring a drop-out from under the posts when teams are held up over the line also makes it harder for sides to grind their way to success. France, give or take their damp slip-up in London, have had to demonstrate both power and panache.Quick GuideRussell urges Scotland to end on a highShowFinn Russell challenged Scotland to add some sheen to their Six Nations campaign in Paris as he lamented the fact they have only a “disruptor” role to play in today’s three-way title shootout.With just home wins over Italy and Wales to their name, co-captain Russell believes a rare away victory over title-chasing France would go a long way to enhancing how their campaign is viewed.Russell, who missed all three of his conversion attempts, including a last-minute kick, in a one-point defeat to England, said: “If we get a win then we’d probably look back at one of my kicks that could have had us winning the title. I think the England game is probably the one that got away.“But if we can finish up with a win this weekend – the frustration for the England game would still be there, obviously – I think we could look back at this tournament as a decent enough tournament.“There’s probably a few folk questioning how the Scotland team is going, but if I hit that kick or one of the kicks, then it’s probably viewed very differently. At this level, it’s all about the results. But at the end of the tournament you can fully assess how it’s been and how you’ve played.”PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It should now be enough to secure them the crown, at least based on the evidence of their 73-24 dismissal of Italy and their subsequent 42-27 demolition of Ireland. If the youthful TGV that is Louis Bielle-Biarrey doesn’t get you – and he has already equalled the Six Nations individual try-scoring record – then the similarly rapid Damian Penaud probably will.Townsend, who used to play at Castres alongside the current Toulouse coach, Ugo Mola, has been suitably respectful in the buildup, suggesting their hosts’ performances in this Six Nations “have been the best I’ve seen from a French team”. That said, eight of Scotland’s 23 this weekend featured in the final rescheduled game of the 2021 championship when the visitors registered their first win in Paris since 1999 and the last two contests between the sides have been nip-and-tuck affairs.View image in fullscreenMatt Sherratt takes charge of Wales as interim coach for the last time before returning to his regular duties with Cardiff.Photograph: Nigel French/PAIt could become even more intriguing depending on afternoon events in Dublin and the subsequent tea-time narrative beneath the roof in Cardiff. Steve Borthwick’s England side have had a strange old campaign in some ways and the final instalment will dictate whether their season is remembered primarily for its blossoming promise or its mixed messages.England’s recent record on final weekends is also poor, with just three away wins – two of them in Rome – since 2003. In that time they have also famously had their travails in Cardiff, most notably in 2013 when Wales beat them 30-3. Remember that old line about even the grimmest of Welsh seasons being instantly salvaged by a win over England? It is suddenly back in circulation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Scott Gibbs scored. In the 70s I was probably wearing red a little bit more. Then come the 90s and early 2000s my dad’s voice probably took over the house a little bit more.

I’ve [only] been a head coach for 18 months … I’ve always been pretty self-aware in terms of my development and I feel I need a bit more time in the saddle as a head coach at club level.”For those preparing to take the field for the final round this weekend, though, there is no time like the present.British & Irish Lions places are still up for grabs and so, too, are one or two coaching futures. The bookmakers rightly have France as odds-on favourites for the title with England at 8-1 and Ireland out at 20-1 but the most memorable Six Nations seasons always contain a twist in the tale.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025France rugby union teamEngland rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamWales rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamSix NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Within a month, though, there could be two, if McManus and Gavin Cromwell, Inothewayurthinkin’s trainer, decide that the seven-year-old has come out of Friday’s race well enough to take his place in the 34-strong field at Aintree on 5 April.McManus was understandably cautious about the possibility of Inothewayurthinkin going to Liverpool as he savoured his latest Gold Cup success, and referenced the fact that Synchronised, his only previous winner of this race, suffered a fatal injury while galloping loose in the National in 2012, a few weeks after his Gold Cup success.He also suffered the painful loss of Corbetts Cross in Friday’s race, in a fall at the second last. “We have to be fair to the horse,” McManus said. “The Gold Cup is a tough race. I’ll see what Gavin says but don’t expect a decision in the next week.”Aintree is a very different challenge these days – there were no fallers at all in last season’s National – and McManus is also the greatest enthusiast for jump racing that the sport has seen in recent decades. He will need no reminding of the ­historic achievement that is now within ­Inothewayurthinkin’s grasp, nor of the fact that his horse, already the 7-1 favourite for the Grand National before Friday’s race, is now about 3-1 to complete jumping’s most ­elusive double.View image in fullscreenInothewayurthinkin ridden by Mark Walsh clears the last ahead of Paul Townend on Galopin Des Champs.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAMcManus, whose tilts at the betting have long been the stuff of festival legend, told an interviewer recently that he does not gamble as much these days, not least because it is ever more difficult to get his money down.He enjoyed the return from a ­different kind of gamble here, though, as Inothewayurthinkin, a handicap chase winner at this meeting last year, was not among the original entries for the Gold Cup and only joined the field thanks to a £25,000 supplementary entry after Cromwell advised the owner that his horse was flying on the gallops and it might be a good idea.McManus backed Cromwell’s judgment, and welcomed back his second Gold Cup winner as a result, thanks to a confident ride by Mark Walsh and, perhaps, a slightly below-par run by Galopin Des Champs.The odds-on favourite had ­finished about seven lengths in front of Inothewayurthinkin in the Irish Gold Cup at Leopardstown in February but was rarely travelling or jumping with his usual fluency here and could not respond as Walsh sent the winner into the lead between the final two fences. A good jump at the last sealed his ­success and ­Inothewayurthinkin crossed the line as a ready winner with something left in the tank.There is, of course, no such thing as an easy race in the Gold Cup and Inothewayurthinkin will be the ­subject of the closest scrutiny at Cromwell’s yard in the days ahead, looking for any hint that he has done enough for now.“Galopin Des Champs was a dual Gold Cup winner, but we were coming here to try and win the race,” ­Cromwell said. “We weren’t ­coming to pick up the pieces and get place money.“Probably it was my fault that he wasn’t entered in the race because I thought it was going to come too soon in his career and we’d be better waiting for next year. He went to the Dublin Racing festival [in February] and ran such a big race, and he’s come forward since that.”View image in fullscreenA dejected Paul Townend on Galopin Des Champs after finishing second in the Gold Cup,Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHe added of the Grand National: “I think we’ll all catch our breath and get the horse home, and we’ll be having the conversation later on, but I suppose you certainly can’t rule it out and it is tempting. It’s certainly something to think about.”McManus, meanwhile, was able to reflect on an unlikely sequence of events that had taken him to the Gold Cup winner’s enclosure once again. “He’s by Walk In The Park,” McManus said, “and as a yearling, Charles O’Brien bought him [Walk In The Park] for ourselves and he failed the [vet’s] test afterwards.“Then he went on to be second in the Derby for someone else, and if I’d got him, he’d have been gelded and I’d have no Gold Cup ­winner, so the Lord works in ­mysterious ways.”Tanganyikacan pay National debtIt was tough going for all but a handful of British trainers at Cheltenham this week and Venetia Williams could not muster even a place in the frame from her 11 runners, but she will head to Uttoxeter for the Midlands Grand National on Saturday with high hopes for a much better showing from her young staying chaser,Tanganyika (3.00).The seven-year-old has shown the steady improvement typical of chasers from the Williams yard in four starts over fences, having finished within 10 lengths of Jagwar, the Plate winner at Cheltenham on Thursday, on his chasing debut in November.Tanganyika got his head in front at the third attempt and then followed up in very impressive style in a stronger race at Carlisle, so much so that Charlie Deutsch was able to ease him down in the closing stages. The step up in trip on Saturday should see further improvement and he is well worth an interest at around 10-1 to get his yard back into the winning groove.Uttoxeter 1.50Dan Skelton is looking for a third win in this race in five years andHidden History,a recent recruit from Chris Gordon, looks weighted to make a successful debut for the yard.Kempton 2.10Teddy Bluewas a late convert to chasing but has made a very promising start over fences and remains on a fair mark after a win at Huntingdon last time.Uttoxeter 2.25A valuable prize and Margaret Mullins’sBlaze The Wayis an interesting contender from Ireland as he attempts to follow up an improved performance when second in a warm race at Navan in January.Kempton 2.45Little went to plan forDouble Powerfulin his pursuit of a seven-timer last time but he showed enough to suggest he is still not weighted out of things on his current mark.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowNewcastle1.27 Matwana 2.02 Electric Jet 2.37 Luminaries 3.12 Cerendipity 3.47 Pay The Piper 4.22 Jamesieconn 4.57 JapetusKempton1.37 Timetoshine 2.10 Teddy Blue (nb) 2.45 Double Powerful 3.20 Bad 3.57 Quebecois 4.32 Dibble Decker 5.07 TrustintimesUttoxeter1.50 Hidden History 2.25 Blaze The Way 3.00 Tanganyika (nap) 3.35 Walk On Quest 4.10 King Of Answers 4.45 Jupiter Des Bordes 5.20 QueensworthySouthwell4.03 Moon Over The Sea 4.38 Hi Ya Mal 5.13 Top Of the Class 5.45 Modern Day 6.15 High On Hope 6.45 Leadenhall Street 7.15 Dicko The LegendWolverhampton5.30 Plage De Havre 6.00 Buraback 6.30 Init Together 7.00 Glorious Kitty 7.30 Rogue Thunder 8.00 Havana Club 8.30 Cosmic ViewWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Kempton 3.20Ben Pauling’sBadshowed improved form to win decisively over track and trip last time and faces a similar challenge here as he bids to follow up.Uttoxeter 3.35Plenty with chances butWalk On Questhas been progressing by the race and a modest 4lb rise in the weights for her latest success in unlikely to stop her completing a five-timer.Explore more on these topicsCheltenham Gold CupCheltenham festival 2025Cheltenham festivalHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

People who can’t appreciate that are jealous’Giles Richardsin MelbourneDutchman says his job is not to please people as he sets out on road for a fifth consecutive F1 drivers title in MelbourneFri 14 Mar 2025 09.39 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 12.41 EDTShareOn the eve of what might be the hardest fought championship of his career, opening in Melbourne this weekend, one thing is clear.Max Verstappenwill not go gently into that night. The defending Formula One world champion, never one to shy away from speaking his mind, a compelling character trait reflected in his driving, is eyeballing the opposition and demanding they bring it on.The 27-year-old took his fourth consecutive F1 title last season, the toughest since his first, the titanic battle with Lewis Hamilton that ended controversiallyin Abu Dhabi, in 2021. In both, when the Dutchman was pushed to the limit, to scrap tooth and nail, he was uncompromising, an elbows-out battler, obdurate, driven by belief in himself and the righteousness of the Verstappen cause.Sun, fun and a favourite son: Melbourne makes a full-throttle return to the top of the F1 calendarRead moreOut of the car his generally easy-going persona belies this steel but it is there in the eyes and the conviction of his voice. As he leans back to consider his attitude to racing, to quote Rotten, J, he means it, man. “I do whatever is needed,” he says, with finality. “I try to always go for it when I think it’s right to do so.“It’s just how I am. I will always go for it when I think it’s possible, whatever other people call it. You might agree with it or not but I just battle the way I think I need to battle.”His acknowledgment that some diverge from his opinion is a concession to the debate sparked whenever Verstappen is feisty on the track. Depending on the viewpoint, he is a rare, exceptional, misunderstood genius and there are no shortage of fans who subscribe to this. Or ranging from reckless and even dangerous, as many concluded when heclashed with Hamilton at Monzataking them both out in 2021, to unsporting and contemptuous of rules, as his protagonist last season, McLaren’s Lando Norris, certainly believed when he was the victim ofaggressive attacking and defending in Mexico last year.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen will face an almighty scrap in the new season.Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/ReutersBut, well, whatever. Because Verstappen does not care. The criticism that such driving tarnishes his reputation is the gnawing of gnats on an elephant hide. “I don’t tell you or someone else how they should live their lives or what they should do in life,” he says. “Everyone should just focus on themselves. I think my behaviour is good. If someone else disagrees, that’s their problem. It’s not my problem, is it?”As F1 prepares for a 24-race season the issue is more pertinent than ever. He will probably face an almighty scrap, not least from Norris and his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, with Hamilton, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari and Mercedes all looking to join the party whileRed Bull, on the early form in Melbourne, have still to solve the problems that wrecked their car for the second half of last year.I will always go for it when I think it’s possible ... It’s just how I amYet Verstappen has beaten them all over the past four seasons and for two of those, 2022 and 2023, was imperious. His driving style was barely discussed because he was so quick, so consistent and so relentless.Success has come at a price, though. At the F175 launch event last month in London, to celebrate the sport’s 75th anniversary and open the new season,Verstappen was roundly booed. He has declined to enter into a debate on why the crowd reacted as it did. However, he was forthright on considering why some do not appreciate his achievements. “They’re just jealous. Jealous of success,” he says.“My dream was to get to F1 and be successful. I’ve achieved that and people that can’t appreciate that, they’re jealous. So that’s fine for them. But it’s not correct, because jealousy doesn’t bring you anywhere in life. I don’t do it for the people, I’m not there to please people that don’t appreciate me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You cannot look through F1’s history without finding greats who shared such iron-willed conviction, not least Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher.“You create your own success,” Verstappen says. “And I’ve created my own success with very important people around me. Of course, part of that success is with the team. All these people that I’m working with and that are close to me, they value that success. That’s what it’s about. And I am very happy with what I have achieved in this sport. That is the most important thing.”His honesty is striking and endearing. Verstappen, like Hamilton, is unafraid of putting himself out there just as he is, for all that such an unapologetic attitude could vex those who have taken against him.View image in fullscreen‘We have a very open relationship, we’re very straightforward,’ says Max Verstappen of the Red Bull team.Photograph: Joao Filipe/DPPI/ShutterstockLast year, when the team’s performance fell away mid‑season, he was unequivocal in his disapproval, describing his ride as an “undriveable monster” and demanding Red Bull remedy it forthwith. Very much part of a frank relationship he enjoys with the team. No one inside Red Bull has anything but positive words to say about Verstappen and a belief he is driven only by a desire for them all to succeed. During the travails of last season what was perceived as a clash between driver and team was part of this process.“My relationship with them didn’t change because we are always very honest with each other,” he says. “If I make a mistake it’s also said. We have a very open relationship, we’re very straightforward. So when it’s good it’s good, when it’s bad it’s bad. That’s how we approach it. That works the best if you want to perform at the highest level.”‘I have to perform’: Jack Doohan edges into F1 spotlight with fragile grip on driver’s seat | Jack SnapeRead moreIt is hard not to wonder if that level of honesty can be uncomfortable or even painful? “Not for me,” is Verstappen’s unsurprisingly blunt response. “It’s how I grew up. When things need to be said, they are said. Some people take that a bit more easy, it’s a personality thing but overall it is well received. We are all part of the process.”When Verstappen made his debut in F1 at 17, he was its youngest ever driver. There followed a steep learning curve, not all of it pretty and not all of it edifying, but pretty much impossible to ignore. A period that forged him such that he insists he would change nothing of those formative years. “It’s important that you make certain mistakes in life and some bits that hurt,” he says.“In terms of missing out on a result or making a mistake, it’s important to have that hunger to try to improve. If you know everything in advance, how to do it correctly, it’s very boring. You make some mistakes, it’s not nice at the time, but sometimes you need a hard lesson to become better.”Compelling as a man and driver, however you regard him, he enlivens the sport and his rivals go into 2025 knowing too well, given all those hard lessons learned, Verstappen will only go down fighting.

A brace from Alessia Russo and own goal from Maren Mjelde gave the Gunners an important three points in the fight for a Champions League spot.Renée Slegers’ side are the quintessential puzzle of a football team. One minute, they can be one of the most eye-catching in the league; the next, utterly frustrating in their inability to break down their opposition.WSL clockwatch: Everton 1-3 Arsenal, Liverpool 3-1 Manchester United – as it happenedRead moreThere have been outbursts of discontent around the Gunners at various points this season. One such period culminated in the crescendo of noise that led to Jonas Eidevall’s departure back in October. Over the last week, the rumblings of dissatisfaction among the team’s passionate fanbase have reared up again after their side wasdumped unceremoniouslyout of the FA Cup by Liverpool at the quarter-final stage which leaves them fighting on just two fronts.One of those is the WSL in which they sat 11 points behind before kick-off on Friday, their chances of overhauling that slim at best. The other is a small matter of the Champions League, success in which has eluded an English side since Arsenal last won it in 2007.There is no doubt it has been a barren few years in terms of silverware for a club of Arsenal’s stature. Just two League Cups have come since their last league title in 2018-19 and they have not won the FA Cup in nine years. Their failure becomes even more stark when you look across to their London rivals, Chelsea, and compare the trophy haul that has come their way.It is a tough expectation for manager Slegers to meet. In her first six months in charge, the 36-year-old has no doubt improved Arsenal’s fortunes – the 11-game unbeaten run at the start of her tenure is testament to that. However, the long-term problems of being unable to break down a low block, a lack of depth in quality beyond the top 15 players, and her own place as a young developing manager all mean that slip-ups inevitably happen. There is also a feeling that she really needs a full transfer window to fully build a squad in her image, a fix that can not happen until the summer.View image in fullscreenEverton looked dangerous on the counter but Alessia Russo’s quality shone through for Arsenal.Photograph: Alex Burstow/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesThis mounting situation had turned Friday night’s game against a resurgent Everton into a must win. It was a fixture that could have been a stereotypical stumbling block. Since the winter break and the purchase of the club by the Friedkin Group, there has been a change of fortunes for Brian Sørensen’s side with money to bolster an injury-hit squad.Slegers opted for Arsenal’s older guard to try to bring stability back. Lia Wälti and Kim Little were paired in the middle with 23-year-old Kyra Cooney-Cross dropped to the bench.The first half saw the same old problems emerge for the visitors as they struggled to break down the opposition’s compact block. Tactically, they attempted different things to unlock the spaces – Leah Williamson was dropping into midfield and Katie McCabe was pushing high up at left back – but they found it hard going.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So often in her career, Little has produced the moment of magic and her visionary run in the buildup to Russo’s goal was emblematic of the quality she brings.Their delight did not last long, however, with Everton’s effectiveness on the transition causing consternation for Arsenal’s backline. The strength and pace of Kelly Gago to muscle Wälti off the ball and the quick-thinking of Toni Payne saw the hosts level the score just before the break.Arsenal were much improved in the second half, playing with a renewed intensity that kept their opponents on the back foot. Where she had failed to change things up against Liverpool the previous Sunday, Slegers was ready to use her substitutes, bringing on four players – Beth Mead, Stina Blackstenius, Caitlin Foord and Kyra Cooney-Cross in the 61st minute. The effect was instant with three of the four involved in the buildup to their second, a move that culminated in an unfortunate own goal for Mjelde.Arsenal were in control from that point, denied from making it more comfortable both by the woodwork and the brilliance of Courtney Brosnan. A second from Russo deep into injury ensured the Gunners travelled home with a vital three points. With Manchester United slipping up, 3-1 against Liverpool at Anfield, it was a result that saw them move up to second – the perfect end to a difficult week.Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's Super LeagueEverton WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It will kick off a series of global “grand slam” events that is expected to run beyond this year.The independently run competition, funded by private US-based investment, has a prize pot believed to extend to a significant seven-figure sum that may rival the money on offer for the Women’s Champions League finalists.Tough love and team bonding: Bompastor’s seamless Chelsea transitionRead moreThe eight teams involved are not confirmed but the Guardian understands at least two Women’s Super League teams could take part in the first competition, staged across three days in the buildup to the final, which takes place in Lisbon on 24 May. Angel City are believed to be one of two likely representatives from the US and Bayern Munich are among a contingent of elite European clubs keen on participating. A final roll call may not be decided until the Champions League finalists have been determined.It is a pioneering development for a sport that has sought new ways to widen its audience and raise income. The tournament, with a number of experienced women’s football executives involved in its creation, will not take place under Uefa’s auspices even though it effectively occurs on the turf of its flagship event. Uefa and Fifa have been involved in dialogue with the organisers, who are understood not to regard themselves as ­competitors to traditional governing bodies.The pair that face off at the Estádio José Alvalade on 24 May are highly unlikely to be among those contesting the seven-a-side event, in which teams will be expected to field their A-list stars. It is believed participants will prioritise the new tournament ahead of any domestic commitments that may clash.International coaches may balk at the prospect of leading players taking on another commitment six weeks before Euro 2025. The competition will allow roll-on, roll-off substitutes, with teams bringing squads of 14, and the expectation is that few players would complete more than 90 minutes of competitive action over the three days.Games will consist of 15-minute halves; the teams will be split into round-robin groups of four, feeding into semi-finals and a final. A “players’ council” is understood to have been formed to ensure players have a strong say on the playing environment. A sequel to the Portugal launch event will be held later in 2025.The rewards on offer may soften the blow for those who have missed out on continental glory. This ­season’s Champions League winners will win up to €1.4m (£1.2m), which will rise to up to €1.995m from next season. The seven-a-side venture will feature a multimillion-pound prize fund that, according to sources, will be split between clubs and players. It will be a significant figure relative to the sums typically on offer in the women’s game, where for example the winners ofthis season’s FA Cupfinal will receive £430,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Owing to the fact the women’s game has never had an official, global women’s club competition, meetings between US and European giants are rare outside of friendlies.Uefa, asked by the Guardian whether it endorsed the tournament, kept a clear distance. “All Uefa finals may attract the interest of private organisers trying to stage unofficial events during the same period,” a statement said. “Uefa does not intend to be involved in any capacity in such events. Seven-a-side is not a codified format of football.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballWomen's Champions LeagueUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

If forecasted gusts of up to 30mph land at Sawgrass on Saturday, this Players Championship will descend into a war of attrition. Day four carries a 70% chance of storms. The PGA Tour’s marquee event could be about to get grisly.There was a time in the dim and distant past whenRory McIlroyshied away from playing in poor conditions. How things have changed. The Northern Irishman now relishes the battle. McIlroy’s second round of 68 placed him just two off the lead, held by Min Woo Lee and Akshay Bhatia.The England job drives people mad but Thomas Tuchel has shot to make it workRead more“I’m looking forward to it,” McIlroy said of what lies ahead. “I think it’s going to be really important to try to flight your ball and keep it under the tree line. I think once it gets above the tree line here it can start to really get hit by it. And it does swirl a little bit but I think when the wind is so strong, it will be a little more consistent. This course is challenging enough, but with a wind like that … I’m excited for that challenge.”McIlroy had flown out of the Friday traps, chipping in at the 10th, his first hole, for a birdie. He played that back nine in a mere 31 shots. Since 2013, McIlroy’s astounding 56 under par aggregate on the inward half here is 20 shots better than any of his opponents.His second nine was less spectacular. He managed to birdie the 2nd before dropping shots at the 6th and 9th. The four-time major winner was candid over the historic discrepancy between his halves at The Players. “The front nine is much harder,” McIlroy said.There was improvement, particularly with tee shots, on day one. “I think I hit more fairways in six holes today than I did in 18 yesterday,” McIlroy added. “I got it in play much better and then from there was able to give myself some opportunities and obviously make some birdies early. I couldn’t quite continue that on to the back nine but it was much better off the tee.”View image in fullscreenTommy Fleetwood chips on to the 11th green during his round of 66.Photograph: Chris O’Meara/APThe leaderboard is a congested one. Collin Morikawa, who wasdefeated at Bay Hill on Sundayin painful fashion, posted a 65 to join McIlroy at minus nine. “I don’t have to get motivated for this week,” Morikawa said. “You show up and you know what the goal is.“I’ve looked at it [Bay Hill] on Monday, Tuesday, figured out what do I need to do different, what do I do the same to put myself in that position and just things go your way, right, and you just make it happen.” Or not, as was the case as Russell Henley pipped Morikawa to the Arnold Palmer Invitational.Tommy Fleetwood, who has previous for excelling in strong wind, is seven under following a second-round 66. Like McIlroy, Fleetwood is totally unfazed by upcoming conditions. “Clearly with the wind it’s a completely different test,” Fleetwood said. “It makes controlling your ball off the tee even more important than it normally is and just giving yourself the chance to control your golf ball and trying to be kind of relentless and patient out there and just keep hitting shots, really. Whatever the challenge is, just looking forward to it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A six-shot deficit to the leaders at halfway will hardly bother Scheffler, such has been his dominance on the PGA Tour in recent times. And yet, publicly the world No 1 was rueful.“The golf course was definitely gettable the first two days,” Scheffler said. “I wasn’t able to take advantage of it the way that I would have hoped to.I felt like I could have scored a lot better. The amount of good putts I hit that just went right around the hole, whether it be slight misreads or whatever. At times last year those were the putts that would go in and the last few weeks seems like they haven’t been.”Scheffler’s wastefulness at least gives others a chance.Explore more on these topicsPGA TourRory McIlroyGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

At various points over the last two decades, it was not uncommon to find these two sides playing one another in a major final. They were Super League’s market leaders.However, if one game summed up how the times have emphatically shifted for at least one of these sides, perhaps this was it. It was a familiar tale in the end, with the Saints ­edging out the Rhinos to book their spot in theChallenge Cupquarter-finals – the 18th time in the last 19 meetings between the teams that St Helens have been victorious.Leeds have emphatically fallen behind Super League’s leading pack in recent years, underlined by the fact it is now five years since they defeated a top-flight side in the cup, dating all the way back to their win in the 2020 final: the last time the Rhinos won a major trophy. On this evidence, that wait doesn’t look like ending any time soon.Challenge Cup romance returns but has RFL’s revamp backfired?Read moreThere can be no faulting the effort Brad Arthur has instilled in this side since taking charge midway through last year, but Leeds’ attack and cutting-edge is found wanting against the better sides far too often. At one stage here, before Ash Handley’s try, they had gone almost 160 minutes without scoring one.By the time Handley did score, this tie had effectively been settled. The Saints are not quite the vintage of recent seasons themselves but when they came alive in a blistering eight-minute purple patch here, scoring 16 unanswered points, you always felt they had enough to progress to the last eight without too many nerves.“There was a lot to like about our performance but things we’ve got to work on,” their coach, Paul Wellens, said. “We’re in a good spot but there’s improvements in us. We’re developing our game and we want to be a team that can hang tough and then go bang, bang and score tries.”It was difficult to agree with Arthur’s assessment of his side post-match. You cannot question their effort but they are yet to find a complete 80-minute performance in 2025 that would ask questions of the best sides.“There was a 10-minute window that hurt us,” he said. “We had good effort and good physicality and stayed in the fight. We’ve got to learn to do that for 80 minutes.” That 10-minute period Arthur points to was indeed crucial – and it effectively swung this tie St Helens’ way.The hosts led 6-2 at the break after Kyle Feldt’s try, but both sides were low on quality and you felt if one stepped it up fractionally, they could pull away. It was the Saints who did that with three tries in the blink of an eye, the first coming through Tristan Sailor to make it 12-2.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leeds, you felt, had no answer for a lead of that margin given how they were approaching two whole games without a try.They at least ended that wait when Handley touched down but with the game now in the final quarter, time was against Leeds. They battled valiantly until the end, epitomised by the fact Harry Newman added another try for the Rhinos with two minutes remaining.However this tie, and the continuation of their miserable Challenge Cup fortunes, had long since been decided.Explore more on these topicsChallenge CupSt HelensLeeds RhinosRugby leaguematch reportsShareReuse this content"

I thought information wanted to be free? I definitely heard that speech should be. We know Meta’s revolting oligarch doesn’t write his self-serving public pronouncements, but he should at least make time in his busy Magafication schedule to read them.Anyway, even if you think the stories in Careless People are untrue – and I don’t, for a single nanosecond – I thought the Meta boss said disinformation wasn’t a thing any more? He recentlybinned off all his factcheckersto “dramatically reduce the amount of censorship”. Yet here we are reading stories of how Meta this week launched an emergency action in the US to ban Wynn-Williams from promoting or further distributing copies of her book. It argued – successfully, for now – that it would face “immediate loss … in the absence of immediate relief”.View image in fullscreenSheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg in Idaho, 8 July 2021.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesHonestly, Mark: TOUGHEN UP! It was only about 10 minutes ago that you weretelling Joe Roganthat corporations needed more “masculine energy”. If something’s wrong or dangerous or really seriously harmful, just let everyone keep seeing it – because, freedom – but pop a “community note” on it. As for how you put a community note on a book, my advice to you would be to go and stand outside Pan Macmillan, which bravely published Wynn-Williams, with a little sign saying “context”. Listen, if it’s a good enough bulwark against the risk of genocide in some boring old developing-world backwater, then it should be good enough for you.The grounds for Meta calling in emergency lawyers to block Wynn-Williams’s book seem to be that she has gone against theterms of her severance. Luckily, none of us has a “non-disparagement clause” against Zuckerberg, who on this evidence and so much more should be disparaged every minute of every day in the countries where he operates, and even in the ones he doesn’t. There’s a lovely bit in the book where his company is said to be “dangling the possibility that it’ll give the Chinese regime special access to users’ data”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PRIn conversation, I overuse the phrase “the worst people in the world”, but the Facebook/Meta top brass really are up there. Wynn-Williams’s book is that simultaneously satisfying yet horrifying thing – an insider account that shows you that absolutely every single one of the awful things you already suspected apparently really did go on behind closed doors. As did a few you didn’t suspect. I knew Sheryl Sandberg’s brand of “lean in” feminism was bullshit – but I didn’t think it involved female employees being encouraged to lean into her lap/her bed on private planes.Shortly after turning this offer down, Wynn-Williams nearly dies in childbirth. Once she’s back at work, her male boss tells her she was insufficiently “responsive” during the period. “In my defence,” says Wynn-Williams, “I was in a coma for some of it.” For light relief, we meet a shadowy Zuckerberg aide who supposedly games his boss’s own algorithm so his posts have mega-engagement. Mark’s senior staff all let him win at Catan.And that’s just the office politics stuff. The hardcore business – what we might call the politics politics stuff – is so much worse. Meta is currently insisting Wynn-Williams was ultimately fired for “poor performance and toxic behaviour”. But it’s amazing to think anyone at Meta could get fired for “toxic behaviour”. I’m sure whatever they’ve done didn’t actively stoke a genocide, like the Rohingya claim that thefirm’s negligence did in Myanmar. I’m sure it couldn’t be as bad as betraying vulnerable citizens in exchange for market penetration.Quite early on in Wynn-Williams’s 2011-2017 stint atFacebook, a US Treasury official tells the Facebook execs they’re two years away from being hated as much as the investment banks. Well, that turned out to be adorably optimistic. I think we alllovethe cuddly old banks compared to companies such as Mark’s or Elon’s. But, of course, the tech firms are way, way too powerful to care.Lean In, said Sheryl Sandberg – but after this week, can we ever see her or Facebook in the same light again? | Emma BrockesRead moreMeanwhile, the world’s children have simply been allowed to become hideously and destructively addicted to their products by politicians who either implicitly – or,as is often claimed in this book, explicitly – thank the companies for assisting their electoral success. We non-American outsiders bang on about US gun laws and how unspeakable it seems to us to raise children in a world of active shooter drills and school massacres. Butallwestern countries and plenty beyond have failed to protect children from the known iniquities and poison of social media. Australia alone has just banned it for under-16s. I’ve no idea where Zuckerberg’s children (the first born of whomhe apparently asked Xi Jinping to name) go to school. But – like metaphorical crack dealers – many Silicon Valley bosses sent their kids to a specific local Steiner school where it’s all crocheted textbooks and chalkboards and no one is stupid enough to let the little scions near the narcotising horrors of the product.So on Meta sails. There are words and phrases for these supranational organised enterprises that harm societies and seemingly do whatever they like, and none of them is the nerdily bland “tech firm”. What was it that the Indians used to call the period of chaos and social instability wreaked by the East India Company, the rampaging entity/“honourable company” that I increasingly feel Meta is most redolent of? Ah yes:the anarchy. We live in a modern form of it now, thanks to Zuckerberg and others, and it’s way past time we did more than simply scroll defeatedly on.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistCareless People by Sarah Wynn-Williams (Pan Macmillan, £22).

Because he’s high on his own supply of fake newsJonathan FreedlandAddicted to Fox News and outlets even more extreme, the president finds support and justification for actions disastrous to Americans and the worldFri 14 Mar 2025 12.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 12.54 EDTShareNot content with shattering the post-1945 international order, which delivered prosperity and power to his country for eight long decades,Donald Trumpis seemingly set on destroying the US economy. And he’s doing it because he, and the American right, have lost their ability to grasp reality.Start with the economic vandalism, unfolding in real time and mesmerising to watch. For weeks, you could see the US stock market falling and falling until on Thursday the S&P indexpassed an unwanted milestone: it stood more than 10% down from the peak it had reached less than a month earlier, a fall that meets the Wall Street definition of a “correction”. In other words, even if the market eventually rallies, this is no blip.The talk now is of a recession and you can tell that Trump himself suspects it’s coming. “I hate to predict things like that,” he saidthis week. “There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America … It takes a little time.” Did you catch that? The great booster, who campaigned on a promise to turn things around “on day one”, is now adopting the lotus position, talking of “transition” and urging patience.The source of the trouble is not mysterious. It is Trump himself. His actions since taking office less than two months ago have spooked investors. They crave stability but see a president who governs by whim. Those whims can change hourly – imposing a tariff after breakfast only to drop it before lunch. One minute it’s a50% levy on Canadian aluminium, the next it’s200% on European wine, only for one or the other to be binned within hours. It keeps Trump in the news, which he loves, but plays havoc with companies that have to plan for the long term. Confronted by chaos, they prefer to wait to see where things settle. That means orders on hold, workers without work, less money in everyone’s pocket.Add in a wild-eyed guy with a chainsaw taking chunks out of a federal bureaucracy that provides services that, for all theirAyn Randtalk of a minimal state, business leaders rely on – whether it’s schools, roads or air traffic controllers to keep planes in the sky – and you can see why the only surging number on Wall Street right now is the one that measures pessimism.To be clear, it’s not just the manic style of Trump andElon Muskthat’s causing alarm. Even if imposed calmly, tariffs are a prosperity killer. Trump may be their biggest advocate, but it’s clear he doesn’t understand how they work. He speaks as if the people paying them will be hated foreigners, the likes of China or Canada forced to pay billions into US coffers. When, in fact, tariffs are a sales tax levied on US consumers who have to pay extra for imported goods. A tariff on foreign cars, say, is not paid by Germany but by an American who buys a BMW. It drives prices up for Americans. When other countries hit back with tariffs of their own, making US products harder to sell, you’re in a trade war that only makes everything worse.Hence the current dread of stagflation, the grim combination of zero growth and rising inflation. The word was born in the Jimmy Carter era, but the Trumpcession will have bonus features all its own. When I spoke to Heather Boushey, who served as an economic adviser to the Biden administration, for the latestPolitics Weekly America podcast, she told me that Musk’s supremacy over so much of the federal government, even as he continues to run his own mega-businesses, is having one particular chilling effect. “Companies are looking at this and saying: ‘I can’t compete with an Elon Musk that’s in charge of the regulatory agencies, that’s going to do things only for himself.’ That’s going to stymie investment, it’s going to stymie innovation, and ultimately be terrible for the US economy.”View image in fullscreenA news report plays in the background as Donald Trump speaks to reporters onboard Air Force One, 14 September 2017.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersBoushey adds that Trump’s US will be less able to weather a recession, because the Trump-Musk cuts are stripping away so much of the infrastructure of support, cutting a combined total of more than$1tn from the Medicaid and food stampsprogrammes alone. When the storm hits, families will go hungry.It’s bad for the country and bad for Trump politically: the people most dependent on soon-to-be gutted government help such as Medicare or Medicaidare Trump voters. As the impact of the cuts kicks in – national parks closed during the summer, delayed benefits for veterans, a deadly accident, for example,in an area previously safeguarded– many Americans could sour on the president who promised to make their lives better. Especially when they see him go ahead with his signature policy:a $4.5tn tax cutthat will massively benefit the very richest.Why, then, is Trump pursuing a course of action that can only damage the country and dent his own standing? The explanation lies in the way Trump sees the world. Which is through a lens clouded by the very phenomenon he once did so much to identify: fake news.For most of the past decade, the focus has been on the likes of Trump and Musk as peddlers of falsehoods. There has been less attention paid to their role as consumers of lies. And yet it’s long been clear that Musk is spending too much time on X and is getting extremely high on his own supply. Witness his credulous swallowing of all kinds offar-right rubbish about Britain.Trump is scarcely any better, believingprovable nonsenseabout Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s poll ratings being in the single digits, when in fact the Ukrainian leader’s numbers are much better than his, to pick just one instance of Trump putting aside the briefings he could have from the world’s best-resourced intelligence agencies and preferring to gobble up internet slop instead.It’s a function of Trump not shifting his core views in decades – he was banging on about tariffs in the 1980s – and being, as Zelenskyy memorably put it, “trapped” in a “disinformation bubble”. It consists of the team of sycophants that now envelops him – the “adults in the room” of the first term are long gone – and whose message is reinforced when he meets the press: note how many of the supposed reporters whom Trump encounters are, in fact, representatives frompro-Trump outletsso slavish they make Fox News look like Edward R Murrow.A president touting Musk’s cars from the White House shows this: the Tesla boycott really irks him | Gaby HinsliffRead moreThe result, saysone longtime Trump watcher, is that “he’s more sheltered from outside information than he ever has been before”. Like Saddam Hussein in his bunker as US forces approach the palace, he is being told that tariffs made the US rich in the 19th century and will do so again, that Elon Musk is popular and that the people are grateful to their leader, even when the economy is nosediving. Inside the info-bubble, any contrary voice can be dismissed, even if it requires acrobatics to do it. Trump’s latest target is the Murdoch-owned, conservative Wall Street Journal, which dared point out the dangers of a trade war:Trump counteredthat the “globalist” WSJ was “owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union”. Inside the bubble, there is no room for truth: it must be kept out by lies.For now, and armed with the loudest megaphone on the planet, the US president can keep reality at bay. But eventually, Americans will be able to see with their own eyes and in their own lives what Trump has done to the US and the wider world. Their daily experience will expose him for what he is: a confidence trickster who has made them poorer and less safe.

I’m sorry, that’s nonsense and I can prove itChris Stokel-WalkerMy freedom of information request revealed the inane use of ChatGPT by the tech secretary. Is this the future? I hope notFri 14 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 14.32 EDTShareTwo tech-related things made me laugh this week. One was Donald Trump’s childlike exuberance at seeing the dash panel of a Tesla on the White House lawn, and his wondrous exclamation that “everything is computer”.The other was equally hilarious, also tied to politics. Keir Starmer stood up yesterday in Hull and said waste would be thrown by the wayside and the civil service would lose its bloat … thanks to thetransformative effects of AI.What I knew, and no one else did untilmy story for New Scientistwas published shortly afterwards, was that the prime minister was talking nonsense. I had seen the government’s AI-powered revolution first hand. And it was all hooey.With what is believed to be a world first use of freedom of information (FoI) laws for this purpose, I had obtained the interactionsPeter Kyle, the UK technology secretary, had with ChatGPT for his job. (The department Kyle heads had rejected an earlier FoI request because granting it ran the risk of unveiling his own personal conversations with ChatGPT.) If Kyle’s chats are any indication of what the AI revolution promises in government, then we’re in for a tough time.My knowledge of the UK’s podcast scene is what you would expect as a middle-aged white man who spends too much time on the internet – so even I could answer the question Kyle first posed to the chatbot:which podcastsshould he appear on to reach a wide audience.What Kyle asked next – which of the four podcasts ChatGPT had recommended had the most listeners – might have seemed like a sensible use of the generative AI tool, but it was also something that a quick Google could have solved in much the same time; and with fewer concerns that it was making up numbers like an overconfident Oxbridge graduate. AI “hallucinations” – the submission of false, incorrect or misleading results – remain a real and present fear with generative AI tools, and are alarmingly common. So too is the idea of mixing things up a little: recent BBC research showed AI tools such as ChatGPT gotmajor things wrongwhen summarising its reporting.As to the tech secretary’s query about why AI adoption is so slow in British small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), that was equally unenlightening. It isn’t a novel or original take to say that data protection laws, such as general data protection regulations (GDPR), may stymie the development of a technology that is subject to multiple lawsuits about data breaches and copyright risks. Nor – you would hope – is it beyond the civil service’s ken to understand that “many SMBs are unaware of these programs or find them difficult to navigate”, as ChatGPT solemnly told Kyle in point seven of a plodding 10-point treatise. “Not reassuring that a minister with a department of experts is using AI for these sorts of questions,” as onecritic put it.View image in fullscreenTechnology secretary Peter Kyle in Downing Street, London, 25 February 2025.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Rex/ShutterstockChatGPT was stronger at answering Kyle’s questions seeking simplified analogies for complicated concepts such as “quantum” or “antimatter” – though, as some social media commentators havepointed out, it’s a little worrying that Kyle felt the need to ask an AI chatbot for a definition of “digital inclusion”. Presumably he should know, as the person responsible for overseeing it?Release of technology secretary’s use of ChatGPT will have Whitehall sweatingRead moreI was generally surprised both by the comparative lack of interaction Kyle had had with ChatGPT, given he’s spent the past several months telling anyone with an audio recorder about his hankering for the technology, and by the sorts of questions he was asking. In fact, my response on seeing the interaction between AI and the minister at the sharp end of the government’s use and knowledge of it was: is this it? Is this the generative AI revolution we’re banking our future and our economy on?There are ways to harness AI in government for the public good. Churning through complicated data to unpick patterns that the human eye misses, for example; AI-powered drug discovery; deep research of the type that can add insights long forgotten or never previously thought about – these are all attainable wins.Quite how the government’s talk of AI’s promise and potential chimes with the reality of how it is used now is something the tech secretary will have to answer for himself. Perhaps he can ask ChatGPT for some help there, too.Chris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite AppDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Don’t look, don’t sell, hold your nerve on the assumption it’ll be fine in 10 years’ time, just as the markets recovered eventually and ebulliently after the 2008 crash and Covid. In the meantime, let’s console ourselves with the silver lining that Elon Musk found himself personally$22.8bn the pooreron Monday, as Tesla’s share price plummeted. Even more gratifying: unlike the overall market losses, Musk’s losses were at least in part caused by personal animus.The backlash against Musk has been growing in recent weeks, driving down Tesla sales, with the car’s dealerships and drivers becoming targets. Sheryl Crow sold hers. The actor Jason Bateman said that driving a Tesla was tantamount to rocking a Trump sticker on your bumper. And with each passing week, more protestersgatheroutside Tesla showrooms across the US. Meanwhile, individual owners have discovered that the cost of driving a car that once symbolised wealth and status is beingcalled a Naziin supermarket car parks. A nice Subaru, anyone?TuesdayTen days after Meghan Markle’s new show,With Love, Meghan, dropped on Netflix there are still questions to answer: primarily, is her insistence on calling herself Sussex strictly in line with protocol? And, by correcting the misuse of her name, was she pass-agg bullying her episode two guest, Mindy Kaling?For my money, Kaling, who appeared on the show to cut heart-shaped sandwiches like the drippy friend in a Jane Austen novel, knew exactly what she had signed up for and no sympathy is due. But reviewing the footage, it’s clear she really did trigger her host’s irritation. “It’s so funny that you keep saying Meghan Markle,” says Meghan – it’s the “keep” in that sentence where the poison is stored – not sounding amused at all. Kaling’s face went full rictus like she’d farted in front of the queen.Opinions differ as to whether Sussex is the correct surname for Markle, as opposed to Wales, Windsor or Mountbatten, and even after the New York Timesput a team on it, the proper answer remains obscure. While one royal expert said Meghan was either totally oblivious to what her actual name was or she didn’t understand it, another averred that Sussex was “totally within royal protocol”. Kaling, meanwhile, had to go on TV to “break her silence” and, not the most ringing endorsement of a grand day out, clarify that she “had a great time”.WednesdayAn American woman whobothered a wombat in Australiadominates global headlines for the second day running when the Australian prime minister wades into the debate. The woman, Sam Jones, who identifies as an influencer, snatched a helpless marsupial from its mother’s arms and held it aloft for the camera for lolz. In a since deleted post on a now-private Instagram, Jones, who previously posted images of herself with animals she had slain while hunting, exclaims: “I caught a baby wombat!”There are laws against this kind of thing in Australia and with the directness we expect from that part of the world, Tony Burke, the Australian home affairs minister, said: “I can’t wait to see the back of this individual.” (By the end of the week, she had left the country). But it was the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who really rose to the occasion and, in a political moment up there with “she was the people’s princess”, addressed Jones directly to say what everyone was thinking: “Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there.”View image in fullscreenDigested photo: ‘Let’s see how they cope when we cut off their maple syrup supply.’Photograph: Dave Chan/AFP/Getty ImagesThursdayIn animal news closer to home, I’m helping a friend buy kittens, and who knew that the market was so weird? My friend’s first instinct was to go through the cat charities, but none of them had new litters available. Next, she looked at the fancy breeders, where pure ragdolls and Bengals can go for £1,200 a piece. At the far end of the scale was the sketchy kitten market online, where people breed litters in their spare rooms or sell them on from illegal kitten farms.The middle path is an online animal exchange where measures are taken to verify users and buyers are warned against breeders who can’t produce the mother. Here’s the wild bit: since Covid, demand for pets in some parts of the country continues to outstrip supply and ordinary tabbies in London can go for £500 a pop and get snapped up within moments of going online – something you would avoid if you weren’t at the sharp end of your children’s relentless campaigning. On Thursday my friend brought home two eight-week-olds, a boy and a girl, tiny and perfect, and OMG I’m in love.FridayTo lift the end of your week, I recommend you watch thefootage of the US vice-president, JD Vance, being booedat the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, a much more forceful effort than the time Mike Pence, in the same job, wasbooed at a 2016 production of Hamilton on Broadway. Unlike the boos for Pence, which were alleviated by counter-cheers, the boos for Vance were solid, sustained, and compounded with derisive whistling, supercharged by the fact Trump fired the Kennedy Center’s chair and replaced 13 of its trustees with his own people, and accompanied by a gratifying visual: that of extremely well-heeled seniors, the Kennedy Center’s constituency, lobbing catcalls for what looked like the first time in their lives.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

A sudden attack of frustration leads to a burst of machismo, achainsaw response. The system stinks. Slash the bureaucrats. Smash the machine.Thatcher had her “subversives”, Tony Blair his “scars on my back”, David Cameron his “enemies of enterprise”. Now Sir Keir Starmerclaims to be haunted by the blockers, checkers, regulators, bloaters. All are ganging up against the cry of his new friend, Donald Trump, togrow, baby, grow. So get going, chainsaw, do your job.Cuts on a scale mooted this week by Starmer, of NHS England and 25% in the administrative costs of regulation for businesses, have been achieved only once in modern times. That was under Cameron’s 2010 government,when almost 300 quangos were “bonfired”. But the chief cause was George Osborne’s savage austerity, cutting resources to local government by as much as a third. If that is Starmer’s intention, perhaps he should say so. As it is, the nearest he has got to Musk was to imitate his slashing of the US’s aid budget last month, which he did bydrastically cutting the UK’s own. It was a classic example of slash fast, count the bodies later.Whether the NHS cuts will prove as drastic as Starmer suggests remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Starmer has created a number of new quangos in the past year. We haveEd Miliband’s gargantuan GB Energy,the Independent Football Regulator and the surely satirical Regulatory Innovation Office. Also promised are more teachers, more carers, more border staff, not to mention more defence workers and soldiers. No chainsaw there, we assume.But nothing Starmer is proposing can come near the bureaucratic explosion planned by his deputy, Angela Rayner. Anyone who has attended planning seminars for the past decade is aware that British planning needs reform – sensitive reform. Yet in order to stifle opposition to her favouring developers eager for houses in the countryside – no one objects to them in towns – she is proposing a revolution. This is nothing short of a whole new layer of regional government, similar to the one tried and abandoned by her predecessor John Prescott.This is to take the form of what could be 30 “combined authorities” under elected “regional mayors”. These mayors will sit in headquarters over and above groups of existing local councils, merging with their neighbours into large ones. The intention is blatantly to eliminate mostly rural local councils that are most likely to oppose housing estates and developments such as pylons and solar arrays in the countryside. More than 164 district or borough councils seem likely to be abolished. I know of no country in Europe where such a crushing of individual village and town democracy could take place.Rayner is not shy about this. She declares it“a completely new way of governing”and nothing short of a constitutional upheaval. Yet there has been no inquiry or commission, no public debate. Theonly documentwas published last December, one of the most unreadable white papers I have seen. It showed no feel for the country it was dismembering, let alone for its countryside or nature. It might have been written one night in an Islington attic.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner arrives at Downing Street for a cabinet meeting.Photograph: Thomas Krych/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockRayner’s mayors will be answerable not to any directly elected assembly, but to a council composed of leaders of their subordinate authorities. This council, with majority voting and a mayoral casting vote, will head a new civil service, its existential purpose being to implement central government policy. Rayner’s mayors will be “in the lead” on all matters of housing and planning. They will be free to alter local council boundaries. They will even be free to act as “default delivery institutions” should the councils fail to meet targets. Leaders of local councils of 500,000 people will merely have a vote in matters of local policy and administration. The document reeks of contempt for local democracy. It reeks of power to the centre.I wonder if Starmer knows the bureaucratic scope of this power. It will supposedly include acouncil of the nations and regions, a mayoral council, anational wealth fundand amayoral data council. They will execute anintegrated settlement, a spatial development strategy, aGet Britain Workingplan and a universal system of strategic planning, to mention a few. Starmer may be abolishing NHS England, but clearly no NHS official need be without a job.As for the reorganisation of the lower tier of local authorities, there is no evidence to suggest that big councils are more efficient or less bureaucratic than smaller ones. They are merely easier to control from above. The experience of recent changes in local government is also that reform costs millions and rarely delivers savings. Such costly upheavals must be the last thing local councils need just now, with abouthalf of councils in England reportedly near to bankruptcy.The superficial appeal of the Musk moment is that by breaking things it leaves room for renewal. That may be. But a civilised democracy subjects it to checks and balances. Dismantling the geography of English local government removes that check and replaces it with Whitehall. All Starmer’s chainsaw will slash is democracy.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourLocal governmentcommentShareReuse this content"

The answer, obviously, is the one thing that usually can’t be had for love nor money, and that’s pimping out the presidential office for advertising purposes.Posing with Elon Muskbeside a scarlet Tesla parked on the White House driveway, Donald Trump announced that he was buying one of his friend’s cars despite not being allowed to drive for security reasons because: “I just want people to know that you can’t be penalised for being a patriot.” The billionaire currently chainsawing his way through so many ordinary federal workers’ jobs had, he said indignantly, been unfairly treated by people who inexplicably now seem to have turned against his cars.Unedifying as all this was, what’s interesting is that it suggests that for once both men are rattled.The once-reassuring idea that stock market jitters would be enough to rein Trump in is now fading fast: this week the presidentrefused to rule out a recession, suggesting only that there would be “a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big”. But it seems he does still care either about his friends losing money, or perhaps about the idea gaining traction that joining Team Trump does the opposite of making you great again. Tesla’sshare price has halved since December, with more than $800bn wiped off the company’s value thanks to sales in Europe nosediving. Musk’s social platform X hasshed usersfast in recent months, while the boss’s trade war seems to have cost his Starlink satellite business a$68m contractwith the Canadian province of Ontario. This is not, to put it mildly, how oligarchy usually works. Asked on Fox Business this week how he managed to run his companies while slashing the state, an unusually downcast-lookingMusk sighed“with great difficulty” before falling silent. It wasn’t exactly an advert for coming on board.Personally I’ve always had my doubts about consumer boycotts, which at best tend to make the non-buyer feel good without achieving very much and at worst hurt ordinary employees with no power to grant whatever the boycotter wants. But Magaworld evidently believes in them, judging by the wayBud Light’s sales plummetedafter it featured a trans influencer in a marketing campaign. And while there’s no justification for violence against car dealers, peacefully not buying stuff is the safest form of protest imaginable for anyone fearful of retaliation by this regime. You don’t have to risk getting arrested, fired or deported; you don’t even have to wave a placard. And for allTrump’s talk of campaigners“illegally and collusively” boycotting Tesla, you can’t be sued for not wanting to buy a car. That boycotts get under the president’s skin where nothing else – not court orders, not the barely disguised horror of old allies abroad – seems therefore to make a strange kind of sense. To a president who sees everything in terms of making money, it’s consumers who matter. And now their wrath is spreading well beyond Musk’s companies.In Sweden, Facebook groups have sprung upurging boycottsof big US brands from Coca-Cola to Nike and Airbnb.Two-thirds of Germanswould now rather avoid buying American where possible, according to a survey for the business newspaper Handelsblatt. In Denmark, amid widespread alarm overTrump’s threatto get Greenland “one way or another”, the country’s biggest grocery chain is reportedly tagging European-made products with a black star to help customers buy local, while Canadians have been furiously boycotting US brands ever since Trump first suggested he wanted to annex their country. Judging by a flurry of Reddit queries about what Canadian alternatives are available in the UK, meanwhile, some Brits may soon be starting to load up on maple syrup, McCain oven chips and extra strong Canadian bread flour (excellent for sourdough, apparently) in solidarity. While a translatlantic trade war is ultimately going to hurt smaller countries more than it hurts the US, it will not necessarily be pain-free for corporate America.‘I feel utter anger’: From Canada to Europe, a movement to boycott US goods is spreadingRead moreMore significantly, Europeandefence stocks have soaredover the last week on the assumption that European governments seeking to rearm in a hurry will be reluctant to buy US-made weapons systems: if Washington is no longer a reliable ally, relying on US spare parts and software updates looks like a potential security weakness. Meanwhile shares in the Franco-British satellite network Eutelsatare up sixfoldon rumours that European governments are looking foralternatives to Musk’s Starlink, and something of the same reverse Midas touch is now clearly blighting political as well as corporate brands associated with Trump. Pierre Poilievre, the rightwing populist who had been expected to demolish Canada’s Liberal party in this year’s elections, has seen hispoll lead evaporate. And in Britain, being tipped as a future Reform UK party leader by Musk seems, if anything, to have helpedend Rupert Lowe’s career. (Didn’t he know there is only ever room for one star in a Nigel Farage party?)It’s too early to tell, of course, whether Trump’s attempt to drum up business on his friend’s behalf will bring the Maga faithful flocking to the rescue of a beleaguered brand. But if they do decide en masse to trade their trucks in for Teslas, at least we can all enjoy the irony of the people otherwise most furiously resistant to electric cars being suckered into accidentally cutting their carbon emissions by a president whodoesn’t appear tobelieve in the climate crisis.

He holds a green card, giving him permanent residence status, and is married to a US citizen. They are expecting their first child soon. Immigration agentsarrested him last weekin his university housing and sent him for detention from New York City to Louisiana. He had been aleader of protestsagainst Israeli war crimes in Gaza.Beyond that, the facts are contested. His friendscalled him“kind, expressive and gentle”. A Columbia professordescribedhim as “someone who seeks mediated resolutions through speech and dialogue. This is not someone who engages in violence, or gets people riled up to do dangerous things.”Deporting speakers over supposed ‘propaganda’ is a stock authoritarian move | Sarah McLaughlinRead moreBut Donald Trump, hailing his arrest,suggestedKhalil was among students “who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity”. The administration has presented no facts to back up these assertions, but even were it to do so, the suggestion that permissible speech can be a basis for deportation is deeply troubling. Trump vowed more such deportation efforts.Ordinarily, the first amendment protects even offensive speech. Although the government retains greaterlatitudeto deport non-citizens, Trump’s rhetoric suggests an intention to step way over the line of propriety. What does it mean to be “anti-American”? As we saw during theMcCarthyera, people can face that accusation for a wide range of legitimate political views. Such campaigns are the antithesis of the free debate that is essential for US democracy.As for the charge of “antisemitism”, Trump seems to be fueling a disturbingtendencyto use claims of antisemitism to silence criticism of the Israeli government. Antisemitism is a serious problem that threatens Jews around the world. But if people see accusations of antisemitism as mere efforts to censor critics of Israel, it would cheapen the concept at a time when the defense against real antisemitism is urgently needed.Even Trump’s unsupported suggestion that Khalil is “pro-terrorist” needs unpacking. To begin with, opposing Israel’s indiscriminate and disproportionateattackson Palestinian civilians, as well as its starvation of them, does not make anyone pro-terrorist. Israel is required to carry out its military response to Hamas’s appalling murders and abductions of 7 October 2023 in accordance with international humanitarian law. War crimes by one sideneversupport war crimes by the other. Pointing that out, if that’s what Khalil did, does not make him “pro-terrorist”; it makes him pro-civilian.Trump’s efforts to censor criticism of Israeli misconduct is a recipe for endless war and atrocitiesThe Trump administration’s retaliation against Khalil is part of its larger attack on campus protests against Israeli war crimes in Gaza. Just days earlier, the administration announced thewithdrawalof $400m in federal funding from Columbia for supposedly failing to protect Jewish students and faculty during anti-Israel protests, the vast majority of which were entirely peaceful. Other universities have now been threatened with a similar suspension of their funding.Coincidentally, I spoke on the Columbia campus days before Khalil’s detention. As a Jew, I did not feel the least bit threatened. Indeed, many of the protesters against Israeli atrocities have been Jewish. Again, Trump’s pretext for censoring critics ofIsraelis transparently thin.If we tolerate an Israel exception to our rights of free speech, we can be sure that other exceptions will follow. Trump likes to half-jokingly refer to himself as a “king”. Are we heading toward a Thailand-stylelèse majestéunder which criticism of the king is criminalized?But censoring criticism of Israel is a poor strategy even for protecting Israel. Trump’splanto “solve” Israel’s Palestinian problem by forcibly deporting millions of Palestinians would be a hugewar crime; it has been rightlyrejectedby the Arab states that Trump envisioned receiving the refugees or later paying to rebuild Gaza.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Another option would be to recognize the “one-state reality” created by Israel’s illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, but the Israeli government refuses to provide equal rights to all residents. Roughly the same number of Jews and Arabs like between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, so Israel would lose its Jewish majority.The most realistic, legal and enduring option remains a two-state solution, an Israeli and Palestinian state living side by side in peace. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has devoted his political career to avoiding a Palestinian state, but it is the best prospect for lasting peace.In pressing Netanyahu to agree to the current temporary ceasefire inGaza, Trump showed his capacity to exert pressure on the Israeli government to take steps toward peace that it resists. He could do the same for a two-state solution.But to build a political support for this important step, we need free debate in the United States. Trump’s efforts to censor criticism of Israeli misconduct is a recipe for endless war and atrocities. Free speech is required if we hope to do better.

Are we any better prepared for the next one?Fri 14 Mar 2025 14.16 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 14.30 EDTShare“When asked what was the biggest disaster of the twentieth century, almost nobody answers the Spanish flu,” notes Laura Spinney in her book Pale Rider, of an event that killed as many as one in 20 of the global population. “There is no cenotaph, no monument in London, Moscow or Washington DC.”Most of us will better understand that absence afterCovid-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization five years ago this week. Some cannot put those events behind them: most obviously, many of those bereaved by the 7 million deaths worldwide (not including thoseindirectly caused by the pandemic), and the significant numbersstill living with long Covid. Others want to forget the loss of loved ones, the months of isolation and the costs to businesses, families and mental health.Yet the political, economic and social ramificationsare still playing out, just as thepersonal onesare. We now know more about the toll of the pandemic, and about how better preparation or a speedier and more adept grasp of the challenge could have reduced it. Some responses were exemplary: Taiwan, New Zealand and South Korea saved lives without excessive social costs.In other places, secrecy, recklessness or complacency took a deadly toll. Too often, health workers and communities excelled while governments fell short. The first report from the UK Covid inquiry, published last year, pointed to “serious errors” by the state in pandemic preparations. Its next report, expectedthis autumn, will focus on political decision-making. The failures there are glaring. Almost 230,000 people died; studies suggest an earlier lockdown could havesaved tens of thousands of lives.A global reckoning is equally important. Though Covid-19 arrived just over 100 years after influenza swept the world, pandemics are not once-in-a-century events. The way we live makes themincreasingly likely. The next pandemic could be caused by a virus more transmissible, more lethal, or both. Across countries, as well as within them, it was poor people who suffered most. But inequity in healthcare and vaccine distribution could cost everyone dearly. Efforts to produce a global pandemic accordhave stalledand need reinvigorating when talks resume next month.On the ground, there has been real progress, not just in vaccine technology but in measures such as access to medical oxygen, which are already saving lives. But preparedness meansstrong public health systemsas well as good medical services. That’s a problem because one of the pandemic’s most potent effects was the sense of isolation and abandonment – even betrayal – that allowed conspiracy theories to flourish. While many felt immense gratitude to researchers and healthcare workers, others became increasingly distrustful not only of vaccines but more generally of science and authority. Robert F Kennedy Jr – who makes wild, false claims about immunisation andreportedly attempted to blockthe rollout of Covid-19 vaccines – is now the US health secretary. Measles casesare surging.Covid-19 showed that pandemic response is not just about knowledge, policy and resources, but about people’s willingness to trust and protect each other. That more nebulous factor may be the harder part of the equation to fix, requiring social and political shifts. But as the WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,wrote this week, we have no alternative to pandemic preparation: “Our collective global security demands it.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This week saw the launch ofChess Masters: The End Gamein which 12 amateur “rising stars” – six men and six women – will compete.Not since American Bobby Fischer beat the Soviet grandmaster Boris Spassky (who died last month)at the height of the cold war has there been so much interest in the game.Chess is booming around the world, becoming one of the fastest growing internet games. Rachel Reeves is well known for having beenBritish girls’ chess champion, aged 14. The chancellor’s favoured opening is the Sicilian Defence, apparently:“It’s quite aggressive,” she has said. A new filmCheckmate, produced by Emma Stone, about 2022’salleged cheating scandalinvolving grandmaster Hans Niemann – he denied all wrongdoing – is in the pipeline.In a sure sign of the game’s zeitgeist credentials, chess is the backdrop and central metaphor in Sally Rooney’s latest novelIntermezzo. Watching YouTube tutorials during lockdown, the author became fascinated by its“mathematical elegance”. As chess buffs will recognise,intermezzo(also known as Zwischenzug)is a term for “an unexpected move that poses a severe threat and forces an immediate response”. Rooney plays her characters like a grandmaster, each chapter alternating perspectives, her lovers advancing and retreating in a series of surprising and risky moves. If anyone can sell chess to gen Z it’s Rooney.Many young people discovered the game online during Covid. Post-pandemic chess club memberships soared. This surge was boosted by the unexpected success of the 2020 Netflix miniseriesThe Queen’s Gambit, based on a little‑known1983 US novel by Walter Tevis, set during the cold war, about an orphaned girl who finds stardom as a chess prodigy. The show, on which the former world champion Garry Kasparov was a consultant, was praised for its accuracy. Sales of chess boards rocketed andgirls were inspiredto take up this male-dominated pastime.With its unbendable framework, unique vocabulary and history, chess is one of the oldest games in the world. It is also one of the most beautiful.There are more possible games of chess than there are atoms in the universe. And its reach has been truly global. As the Guardian journalistStephen Moss writes in his book The Rookie, chess is “a very good barometer of power”. When countries rise so does their game, with India (where the game is believed to have originated) and China becoming leading chess nations in recent decades.Far from posing an existential threat, as was widely feared, computers and AI have given the game a new lease of life. As with reading, chess is inexpensive, you can do it anywhere and you can lose yourself in it for hours. For many, the board’s 64 squares are where they can belong, and chess communities somewhere they can thrive. No wonder it is so popular.This isn’t the first time the BBC has taken on bishops and rooks. Capitalising on the Fischer‑Spassky fever,The Master Game, which ran between 1975 and 1983, was a quietly thrilling show in which players provided commentary (recorded later) on their match. It remains to be seen if Chess Masters can succeed in making the game riveting TV. If it persuades more people, young and old, to play it will be a winner.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Trump’s ravings can be seen as a response to discovering that this was never true. The truth is that other western countries have foolishly, and needlessly, supported the US in this delusion. Now we all have to pay the price.It should be possible to clear up at least some of the mess, but Europeans (and I include the British in that description) should be very wary of just picking up where the US is likely to leave off.Russiais an obstacle. Ukraine is an obstacle. Several EU member states could turn out to be obstacles. But we should be conscious that Britain and other Nato members have been instrumental, since the fall of the Soviet Union, in creating this situation.Thirty-five years ago, Russia was willing to be a collaborative partner with the west, butEurope, guided by the US, sought to characterise it not as an emerging sophisticated state, but as the hungry wolf on Europe’s borders. We will have to pay the price for this as well, but this should not involve abandoning, in the interests of militarisation, domestic expenditure that could dramatically improve ordinary lives. A second wrong will not make the first one right.Michael BowersTalgarth, PowysJonathan Freedland’s depiction of a president of the United States as a mafia boss should either shock or amuse us. Sadly, it is all too accurate. There is a risk that we attribute the chaos and havoc wreaked byDonald Trumpto the vagaries of his personality. It is much more sinister than that.Trump’s guiding principle is to deny the basic human rights of all those who are not a reflection of his own self-image. Only those he sees as strong, assertive, affluent and winners are of value to him. Those who do not fit this image are deemed unworthy of his attention. This creed is applied to many of his fellow Americans, from whom he has stripped access to healthcare, employment and welfare support; to victims of war and famine, from whom he has withdrawn financial aid and support; and even from the US’s longstanding allies, on whom he has imposed tariffs or sanctions. This is the raw politics of dictators and plunderers, of the conquerors and the vanquished.The world has suddenly become a much more dangerous place for us all. Freedland is right that Britain must now sever our umbilical reliance on the US and align with our European neighbours to help establish a powerful counter-force to the anarchic Trump regime.Peter RiddleWirksworth, DerbyshireJonathan Freedland’s mafia analogy for Donald Trump is helpful but since he dodged the assassin’s bullet, another dimension of Trump’s personality has appeared: a messiah complex. The bullying narcissist now believes that he is the saviour of the world. His rage against anyone who dares question his pronouncements and his ranting against the source of all evil, Joe Biden, suggests he thinks himself divinely inspired.Previously decent Republicans, believers in free trade and standing up to Putin, now behave like members of a Trumpian cult, happy to accept that the leader is right to overturn all they previously thought right. Ukraine is abandoned and Russia is praised, and Trump tells us that he alone knows a secret which proves that Putin really wants peace.

Debts of people who are struggling are bought and sold for pennies on the pound, while they remain liable for the full amount – and may face distressing visits from debt collectors and bailiffs. Our research, with the Centre for Responsible Credit, found that debt purchasers expect to collect back between two and three times what they paid for the debt.Personal debt has spiralled because of low wages, insecure work and a broken lending system that punishes communities who can least afford it. Sheen is right – people are working hard, often juggling multiple jobs, yet are stuck in cycles of high-cost credit simply to cover essentials. More than10 million peopleacross the UK are “over-indebted”, either behind on bills or finding debts a heavy financial burden – up 70% on pre-pandemic levels. Council tax arrears in England alone havereached £6bn.With debt on this scale, we can’t rely on the generosity of individuals to cancel debt. We need systemic reform, including fairer lending practices and government action to address unaffordable debt at its roots.Heidi ChowExecutive director, Debt JusticeMichael Sheen’s gesture illustrates the power of people in positions of relative wealth and/or power to alleviate suffering and do something genuinely life changing for a pretty big number of people. It’s a tale for our times and is heartwarming, if only to remind us that there are truly community-minded people still among us. Imagine the suffering the super-rich could alleviate, if only they felt the poor and needy were worth it.There will, of course, be the cynics and the envious who claim he’s in it for the publicity – but aren’t there always? I am very touched by what Michael has done for the people of his area. It’s a beautiful thing.Donna WhiteBarnet, LondonBravo, Michael Sheen, for what you have done and continue to do.

For a few, though, it was one of the most exciting natural events of their lives.Over the course of the weekend and into Monday, throngs of birdwatchers lined the shores of Bramble Bay in the bayside suburbs of Shorncliffe, Sandgate and Redcliffe, telescopes and cameras at the ready.But the excitement of seeing birds that usually spend their lives at sea up close as they were pushed up against the coast – some flopping into suburban back yards, barely able to walk – was tempered by sadness and pity.In the middle of cyclone preparation I found a baby bird – one tiny, wild life amid the wind and rain | Jessie ColeRead moreWhile seabirds are highly evolved to survive in extreme environments, cyclones cause mass casualties.Unable to land or find food in the churning ocean, they become exhausted and quickly lose conditioning.

At one point, it rocks back and forth.“His waterproofing is not the best,” they say. “When they come in not waterproof, it takes a while to get them ready for release.”Seabirds have an oil gland at the base of their tail, which they first rub their heads against, then over their feathers for waterproofing. As their condition deteriorates, they lack the energy to administer this routine self-care.Its prospects look grim. “It’s a bit too early at the moment to say, because he’s so exhausted anything can happen,” the twins say. “Their little hearts can just give in.

We’ve noticed that here in Australia too, so these events give us an insight into what’s happening out there in the ocean, and gathering that information is really useful.“To track seabird populations we need to monitor them, and that’s usually done at breeding colonies, but this gives us a window into what’s happening at sea when birds are away from their nesting areas.“We had a shy albatross, for example, which is incredibly rare in this part of the world; this record shows that there are still some of those birds here.”View image in fullscreenA juvenile frigatebird hangs out at Twinnies Pelican And Seabird Rescue on the Sunshine Coast.Photograph: Andrew Stafford/The GuardianSome are even rarer.

The scope of the scheme – and its budget – are being reassessed.The SFI is part of a package of payments that replaced the EU’s common agricultural policy and paid land managers for the amount of land in their care, with the aim of paying farmers to look after nature, soil and other public goods, rather than simply for farming and owning land.The Guardian understands that the view in the department is that the scheme is now too wide and gets spent too quickly. Rather than being assessed on merit, payments are “first come, first served”, meaning farms with agents to fill out documents have an advantage in accessing funding. It also means many productive farms use up the funding by doing things such as leaving grassy margins and scattering wild birdseed. Ministers believe the money could be better spent on farms that are less well-off but more rich in nature, which could make a more positive difference to the environment.Daniel Zeichner, the farming minister, told parliament on Wednesday: “The schemes that we inherited had no way of prioritising properly; it was a first-come, first-served scheme. I was very clear when I took over that we would not immediately overturn the existing system; we wanted to give people confidence about the future. However, when we come to redesign the scheme, we can design it better to address [these] issues.”Defra sources confirmed they were exploring plans to make it a more targeted scheme, meaning the farms that make the most money would not be able to apply.This is likely to be just the latest measure to be unpopular with farmers, after the government introduced an inheritance tax on agricultural land in the autumn budget and this week announced plans to give Natural England the power to compulsorily buy farmland. A report published this week shows that farmers’ incomehas not improvedsince the 1970s.Tom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, said: “My big fear is the transition was sold as an opportunity for all farmers. Now it feels like it’s going to be much more targeted in its delivery, leaving some farms in the cold.“A wider scheme means people can move up the scale and be more ambitious; making it more targeted would mean some farmers won’t be able to get on the ladder and start delivering for nature.“We want to work with Defra to develop the detail of this, but our position has been there should be funds available for every farmer who wants to contribute to nature.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lucy Pegg, political adviser at the thinktank Green Alliance, said: “The farming budget is crucial to Britain’s stability and security, so must be protected. But when budgets are tight, it is right that funding is directed towards the lowest-paid farmers, who cannot make a profit from food production alone.“Often these farmers also have the biggest role to play in protecting the environment and it is right their work reducing flood risk, creating carbon-storing habitats and protecting beloved wildlife is supported by government.”Tom Lancaster, head of land, food and farming at the Energy and Climate Information Unit, said: “The evidence points to the fact that you can’t meet legally binding nature and water targets without a widely available scheme like the SFI.“Many of the low-carbon farming methods included in the seventh carbon budget advice [from the Climate Change Committee] may also lean on the SFI. The key thing for Defra now is not to restrict the availability of the scheme, but to better target the options in the scheme. This could include putting caps on certain options that have absorbed too much of the funding so far and that are likely to deliver questionable value for money.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingBrexitClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m visiting Beijing, and that’s what I’ll tell them | Ed MilibandRead moreEd Miliband, the UK’s energy and net zero secretary, arrived in Beijing on Friday for three days of talks with top Chinese officials, including discussions on green technology supply chains, coal and the critical minerals needed for clean energy. The UK’s green economy isgrowing three times faster than the rest of the economy, but access to components and materials will be crucial for that to continue.He said: “We can only keep future generations safe from climate change if all major emitters act. It is simply an act of negligence to today’s and future generations not to engageChinaon how it can play its part in taking action on climate.”Writing in the Guardian, he added: “Climate action at home without pushing other, larger countries to do their fair share would not protect current and future generations. We will only protect our farmers, our pensioners and our children if we get other countries of the world to play their part.”China is facing abarrage of tariffs from Trump on its exports to the US, and the possibility that theEU will start levying green tariffs on imports of high-carbon Chinese goods, such as steel.The world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter is profiting from recordexports of electric vehicles, solar panels and other low-carbon goods. But it is stillhighly dependent on coal, and though the upward march of its emissionsappears to have paused, whether China reduces its carbon output or returns to fossil fuels may depend largely on the government’s response to Trump’s trade war.Many experts believe the only prospect of staving off climate breakdown is for China, the EU, the UK and other major economies to form a pro-climate bloc alongside vulnerable developing countries, to counter the weight of US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and petrostates pushing for the continued expansion of fossil fuels.Miliband’s visit to Beijing is the first by a UK energy secretary in eight years. He visited India last month on a similar mission, and travelled to Brazil last year, as well as holding meetings with many minsters of developing countries at theCop29 climate summitlast November.Catherine Abreu, the director of the International Climate Politics Hub, said: “It’s really important to see this happening – there is no way to fulfil the Paris agreement without China. And China has made clear it is willing to be more vocal on these issues, to boost climate action. We see an openness in China to band together with Europe, Canada, the UK on climate issues.”But the prospects of agreement on the sharp emissions cuts needed globally to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, in line with the Paris agreement, are increasingly remote.Brazil will host this year’s UN climate summit, Cop30, in the Amazon in November amid the worst geopolitical tensions in decades, and as many governments prepare to pour money into rearmament.Only a handful of countries, including the UK, have so far submitted their national plans on emissions cuts for the next decade as required under the 2015 Paris agreement, despite thedeadline passing last month. China is unlikely to produce its plan until much closer to the Cop30 conference, and will be keenly watched, as its current carbon targets are much too weak to stay within the 1.5C limit.Miliband may find he needs to adapt his plans for a booming green economy in the UK in the face of China’s economic dominance of the low-carbon technology market, according to Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.“We need to be honest about the economic reality,” he said. “All countries in the world are hoping for a share of the green pie. But that is not aligned with the economic reality … that they can’t outcompete China.”Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsClimate crisisGreen economyRenewable energyChinaEd MilibandEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

And that’s a conversation that in the months to come we’ll be having with parents, Phillipson said.“We all know the challenges. The hard bit is how we ensure we have a lasting system that really endures in a way that, frankly, the system 10 years ago hasn’t delivered.”Ministers plan major changes to Send education in EnglandRead moreSince 2014, local authorities in England have funded special educational needs and disabilities (Send) provision for children and young people through their high-needs budgets. But as statutory claims for additional support through education, health and care plans (EHCPs) have soared, councils have beenforced to run budget deficitsthat are estimated to reach a collective £5bn.This month the Guardian revealed that ministers are preparing a white paper to overhaul Send provision, with local authorities lobbying the government to give them more control over costs by limiting parental rights to appeals.Asked if the plans included making it harder for children to qualify for extra support through an EHCP, Phillipson said: “I understand the anxiety that parents feel, not least because the system we’ve got at the moment is so adversarial, so pressured, where parents have to fight really hard.“What I want to get to is a system where support is put in place far more quickly for children who need additional support; much earlier identification of need; much more timely intervention and support.“That’s a world away from where we are at the moment, and the system that we’ve inherited from the Conservatives has lost the confidence of parents.”Phillipson denied that the need to rein in spending was behind the changes. She said: “My first priority in reforming the system is better outcomes for children. Clearly, there are cost pressures alongside this, but that is not the driver of what we’re seeking to achieve. It is about better outcomes for children with Send.”Manny Botwe, the ASCL’s president, earlier told the conference: “Schools are struggling to afford the costs of Send provision, and we are facing a shortage of places in special schools to meet growing demand. The whole system is on the brink of collapse, and we cannot allow this to continue.”In her speech, Phillipson announced a new call for evidence on how to make mainstream schools more inclusive for pupils with special needs, after last year announcing an extra £740m in capital funding to allow adaptions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of course it’s not easy, but it is possible. There are schools and trusts doing it already.”The call for evidence will be led by Tom Rees, the chair of the government’s expert advisory group on inclusion, to improve inclusion within mainstream schools.Rees said: “What’s clear is that there is consensus to move beyond just talking about the problems with the Send system and to push forward practical and evidence-led solutions which build on good work where it is happening in the system.”Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “We all want to build an inclusive education system and build parental confidence on Send but our question is simply, where is the funding?”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchool fundingBridget PhillipsonSchoolsLocal governmentEnglandChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

A settlement has now been reached with no admission of liability from the corporation. A three-week tribunal into the claims had been due to begin on Monday, but will now not take place.The four women, who all remain at the corporation, said in a statement: “We can confirm that we have reached a resolution with BBC management that avoids the need for a tribunal hearing in respect of our employment-related claims.“A protracted process lasting almost three years is now over. We’ve been deeply moved by the support we’ve received. We look forward to contributing further to the success of BBC News, especially to live programming and the growing streaming services that are so important to our audiences.”The legal case dates back to the summer of 2022, when the corporation announced it was merging its domestic and global news channels. It led to a recruitment process for five chief presenters. In witness statementsreleased last year, the women said some of them were demoted, while others faced a pay cut.They had argued that evidence from a whistleblower would show the BBC ran “a sham” recruitment process. They claimed that Jess Brammar, then the BBC’s editor of news channels, had “privately assured four other chief presenters – two men and two younger women – their jobs were safe, but admitted she couldn’t say much ‘for legal reasons’”.They claimed to have been victimised and to have suffered harassment, ill-health and reputational damage. All were off air for more than a year in the aftermath. The successful candidates for the presenting posts were Matthew Amroliwala, Christian Fraser, Yalda Hakim, Lucy Hockings and Maryam Moshiri. Hakim has since become the lead world news presenter for Sky News.The BBC has denied the women’s claims. It said all candidates involved in the process for the chief presenter roles underwent the same fair application process, involving an interview and practical assessments. It has said at least five other applicants recorded higher scores than the women during the “objective assessment”.The end of the case will be a relief to BBC bosses as they grapple with a series of running issues, including the start of BBC charter renewal talks, the departure of an influential executive and serious questions over itshandling of a Gaza documentary.Brammar is now an editorial executive in BBC content and works closely with Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s outgoing chief content officer. Moore, often regarded as the most influential woman in British television, recently announced her shock decision to leave the corporation.A BBC spokesperson said: “After careful consideration we have reached a resolution which brings to an end protracted legal proceedings with four members of staff and avoids further costs for the BBC. In doing so we have not accepted any liability or any of the arguments made against the BBC. We are simply bringing to a close all of the actions brought against us so that all involved can move forward.“The BBC successfully launched a single BBC News channel in 2023, bringing the best live and breaking news on TV and online both here and around the world. We welcome this opportunity to now look to the future, and to work together on delivering for our audiences – which is our first priority.”Explore more on these topicsBBCWomenGendernewsShareReuse this content"

The 68-year-old American former banker, who has a wife and two daughters, said it had been with a staff member of Epstein, the financier whodied in prison in 2019while awaiting trial for trafficking underage girls for sex. “We had one encounter,” Staley told the court. “Much to my embarrassment today.”It was a shock admission in a legal case that needed little help making headlines. The hearing – meant to determine whether the former high street bank boss lied about ties to a now-dead sex offender – had already named some of the world’s largest banks, business executives, politicians, celebrities and royalty in evidence.The case, in fact, had been brought by Staley.It was part of last-ditch efforts to salvage his reputation, and challenge the regulator’s investigation, Operation Downey, which also resulted in a £1.8m fine.The ruling cost Staley a further £18m in pay and bonuses from Barclays, two years after he wasforced to resignand effectively end his 43-year career in finance.The case centred on the contents of a 2019 letter from Barclays to the FCA, which stated that he and Epstein “did not have a close relationship” and were last in contact “well before” Staley became its CEO in 2015.But the FCA said the two men had a close relationship that “went beyond one that was professional in nature”, and presented Staley with evidence drawn from Epstein’s estate and a cache of 1,200 emails provided by his former employer, JP Morgan.Staley, who took the witness box from Monday, was asked to explain messages where the pair declared their “deep” and “profound” friendship and called each other “family”.That included one email sent in November 2009 by Staley while staying at Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico: “So when all hell breaks lose [sic], and the world is crumbling, I will come here, and be at peace. Presently, I’m in the hot tub with a glass of white wine. This is an amazing place. Truly amazing. Next time, we’re here together. I owe you much. And I deeply appreciate our friendship. I have few so profound.”Another, sent after their last in-person meeting at Epstein’s private Caribbean island in April 2015, thanked the financier for a flight and lunch. “Your place is crazy and special. It has a warmth and silliness that makes it yours. I count u as a deep friend.”But the banker – who claimed to have few personal friends – maintained these were merely exaggerations and indicative of his “effusive” communications style, a claimed echoed by his former chief of staff, Sasha Wiggins, who took the stand last week.She said Staley declared on numerous occasions that he never invited Epstein to his home or “milestone birthdays”, and defended his prior perception of the financier, who had been jailed in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor. “Mr Staley said to me once: ‘Why would I have introduced my wife and daughters to Mr Epstein if I thought he was a paedophile?’”Staley denied keeping information from Barclays, including that he strategised with Epstein on how to handle media queries about their relationship in the weeks leading up to his appointment in 2015.Staley also said he did not know why Epstein had sent him photos of women, including one in a low-cut dress, but said this was not uncommon for business friends, particularly “if you’ve ever worked on a trading floor in Wall Street”.The former banker struggled to recall details surrounding the more notorious exchanges in which the pair discussed lovers and sex, corresponded from a debutante ball, or cryptically referred to their preferred Disney princesses.Staley’s lack of explanation surrounding that exchange left Mulcahy to declare that his “lack of recollection seems surprising”.All in all, Staley spent nearly four gruelling days in the witness box. At times, the otherwise affable American grew agitated under FCA questioning, particularly when the regulator alleged that Epstein pulled strings in academia for his daughter. At times, Mulcahy had to remind Staley that she had to establish the facts, and that she, in fact, was the one asking questions.View image in fullscreenStaley tried to shift blame to Barclays and the FCA.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThe regulator said he also misled it when Barclays stated Staley’s contact with Epstein ended “well before” he joined the bank in 2015, with the pair emailing and calling until his appointment was announced on 28 October that year.Later, the regulator said, the pair used Staley’s daughter to pass messages between them after Staley says he cut ties.Staley said he was unaware that his daughter was in contact with Epstein at the time.But the American banker, who flew across the Atlantic to sit through the entirety of the two-week proceedings, tried to shift blame to Barclays and the FCA.He told the tribunal that he was transparent with Barclays, and relied on its legal advice when approving the contents of the letter, including that “contact” meant the last time he was physically present with Epstein, whom he last saw in April 2015.Staley also blamed the FCA, saying it fell short by relaying queries to the Barclays chair, Nigel Higgins – who is still in the role – by phone rather than in writing. He says this left Barclays primarily concerned about dispelling whether Staley had any knowledge of, or involvement in, Epstein’s crimes, which Staley vehemently denies.His legal battle forced some of the most high-profile regulators and bankers to the stand.The Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey, was among them, called because of his previous role as chief executive of the FCA. Bailey recalled that Higgins accused him of “destroying” Staley, as he relayed news of the investigation in December 2019, and asked whether the FCA might be willing to drop its investigation if Staley resigned. Bailey declined.Staley told the court at the end of the FCA’s cross-examination on Thursday: “I have been honest such that I have put my marriage at risk these last few days. I have never shied away from telling the truth about all of this … I would not try to mislead the FCA. I never have and I never will.”A decision is expected within three months of closing submissions, which are due to take place on 2-3 April.Explore more on these topicsFinancial Conduct AuthorityJes StaleyRegulatorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She is also a former press spokesperson for the former Trump strategist Steve Bannon.The Good Law Project, a campaign group, wrote to the Commons standards commissioner this week asking why the support was not registered with parliament as a benefit on Farage’s register of interests.‘People want change’: voter anger opens door for Reform in key Labour seatsRead moreJolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said: “Documents released by the Foreign Agents Registration Act [Fara] unit of the United States Department of Justice have revealed thatNigel Faragewas in receipt of a range of hospitality and logistics support from US PR firm Capital HQ in the period between February 2023 and February 2025. Since becoming an MP in the last general election, Mr Farage has not declared any of this on his register of interests.”Maugham highlighted a recent US disclosure that since late September last year Capital HQ and its staff supported Farage’s political activities in the US on an almost daily basis.Thecode of conduct for MPsstates that members must register donations worth more than £1,500, including “support in kind, including any of the following, if provided either free or at concessionary rates: advice or information services; receptions and events; training or development for the member or his or her staff; the services of staff or interns; the provision of office space or equipment; hospitality or travel benefits such as season tickets or parking”.If an MP receives gifts or benefits with a value of more than £300 from a source outside the UK, they must register it if it relates in any way to their membership of the house or parliamentary or political activities, either free or at concessionary rates. Trips outside the UK with travel or hospitality provided worth more than £300 must also be registered – but if undertaken for the purpose of outside employment, such as a paid speech, that should be declared separately.Farage has made at least eight trips to the US since he was elected as MP for Clacton-on-Sea. Some of the trips appear to be linked to his outside employment, but on other occasions he appears to have attended political events and made unpaid media appearances and speeches.Maugham said Farage had made several trips to the US to carry out political activities and speaking engagements using his platform as a member of parliament and the leader ofReform UK.Farafilings showthat hotel accommodation in the US was paid for by Capital HQ in July 2024 to the value of $3,531.10 (£2,729.24) between 14 and 19 July at the Hilton Hotel Inn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in connection with the Republican national convention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here we look at how and why the arms-length body was set up as part of changes initiated by the former Conservative health minister, Andrew Lansley, in an effort to improve decision-making in the health service.What did Lansley change in 2012?The changes introduced by Andrew Lansley, health secretary in the coalition government, represented the biggest reorganisation in the history of the NHS. One NHS leader quipped at the time that the overhaul was so big it was visible from space. Lansley promised that his Health and Social Care Act 2012 would take politics out of the day-to-day running of the NHS. The act scrapped regional health authorities and shifted NHS commissioning power to GPs, through organisations later known as clinical commissioning groups. It also set up autonomous NHS organisations such as the NHS commissioning board, which later became known as NHS England, to run the service at arm’s length from ministerial micromanagement. In addition, the act transferred responsibility for public health to local government.Did Lansley privatise the NHS?No, but the changes introduced what critics called a “creeping privatisation” with a market-based system for more private involvement in healthcare. Under the banner of extending choice, Lansley’s act allowed providers from the private and voluntary sectors to bid to supply NHS care. Critics claimed that handing budgets to GPs as independent contractors amounted to privatising the commissioning function of the NHS.What was the reaction?The changes were almost universally criticised at the time, and there is now a general consensus they have been a disaster. Much of the criticism focused on the role of the private sector. But experts also questioned the scale of changes at a time when budgets were being slashed under the austerity programme. The British Medical Association condemned the act as the “end of the NHS as we know it”. Lord Darzi, in his critical review of the NHS for the Labour government, pointed out that since the act public satisfaction with NHS had nosedived. He described the Lansley changes as a “scorched earth” policy.What problems did the changes create?The scheme caused widespread upheaval but also greater bureaucracy and duplication. In his last report, Darzi complained that the NHS had been in “constant flux” since the Lansley changes. Darzi said: “The instability of NHS structures and the multitude of workarounds and sticking plasters that became necessary as a result of the dysfunction of the Health and Social Care Act meant that NHS processes became fiendishly complicated. The act divided up functions among a multiplicity of new institutions. In a single decade, NHS Improvement, the NHS Trust Development Authority, Health Education England, NHS X and NHS Digital were all created and abolished, with their functions and staff rolled into NHS England.” Critics also complain of less accountability owing to the complexity of the system and the increased role of private providers.graphicDid Lansley’s changes lead to increased duplication?Yes, according to the health secretary, Wes Streeting. He claimed that “the number of people working in the centre has more than doubled since 2010” referring to roles in both NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care. The changes also started a pattern of creating and then abolishing a number of NHS bodies, leading to more duplication and complexity.Have they already been reversed?Many of the Lansley changes have been chipped away or significantly modified. The Health and Care Act 2022 shifted the focus of the NHS from competition to collaboration with a scrapping of a markets-style economic regulator. It also scrapped GP-led clinical commissioning groups, with integrated care boards to fund and plan NHS services. These included various NHS organisations and local councils. Under the 2022 act, NHS England was also given more commissioning power for primary care, dentistry and optometry. Despite these changes, private and voluntary sector organisations continued to be involved in providing NHS care.Does the plan to abolish NHS England finally demolish the Lansley scheme?Only time will tell, but Streeting claims the plan is “the final nail in the coffin of the disastrous 2012 reorganisation”. He says that integrating NHS England into his department “will put an end to the duplication resulting from two organisations doing the same job in a system currently holding staff back from delivering for patients”. However, critics point out that, like the Lansley scheme, this latest upheaval comes against a backdrop of public spending cuts that threaten to undermine the good intentions behind the plans.Explore more on these topicsHealth policyNHSHealthexplainersShareReuse this content"

The vehicle that hit him failed to stop.The presidential motorcade, often made up of dozens of vehicles, is driven in high speeds for security reasons, according to the police.Muchiri told the BBC that Frederick had been visiting Kenya to see his sister and nephew who live in the country. He said a postmortem would be held.Explore more on these topicsKenyanewsShareReuse this content"

Overall, visitor numbers are about three-quarters of pre-pandemic levels which, combined with cuts to culture budgets, is putting pressure on institutions to reduce costs.Last year, Tate’s trustees approved another deficit budget to give the institution time to develop a new financially sustainable business model.About 30% of Tate’s income comes from government grants. The rest is raised through private fundraising – including corporate support, philanthropic donations and legacy bequests – as well as money from exhibition ticket sales.Tate Liverpool, which opened at the Royal Albert Dock in 1988, is undergoing a £29.7m redevelopment, which includes the installation of new galleries.Tate St Ives is restoring the Palais de Danse – Barbara Hepworth’s second studio space. In May, Tate Modern will mark its 25th birthday with free performances and events, as well as the return of Louise Bourgeois’s spider, Maman, to the Turbine Hall.The Prospect union said it was engaging with Tate on the planned changes and would support any staff affected.The union’s national secretary for heritage, Sharon Brown, said: “We are clear that the expertise and experience of museum and gallery workers, who are often underpaid and undervalued, is what brings the collections alive and is fundamental to the success of the sector.“Budget cuts and the impact of the pandemic have hit the sector hard and more must be done to invest in these institutions and the workforce, which are an essential part of our domestic and international visitor economy as well as of Britain’s cultural landscape.”Explore more on these topicsTate ModernTate BritainTate LiverpoolTate St IvesArts fundingMuseumsJob lossesnewsShareReuse this content"

No court can undo the hurt you have caused.”Kondor’s fiancee, Mariana Gheorghe, said in a victim impact statement that she had been “forced to return to Romania with a broken heart” after his death, and described Kondor as a “man of integrity and hard work”.She said he had had a difficult upbringing in Romania and moved to Italy at the age of 19, doing various jobs and working as a volunteer to help earthquake victims in 2009.Gheorghe said Kondor moved to England in 2019 and worked as a delivery driver and security guard, realising his dream of owning his own van in July 2024 – just weeks before he was murdered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The limited measure, an overdue completion of the removal of hereditary peers that began 26 years ago, is a further illustration of the constitutional difficulties of reforming parliament’s second chamber.Tories fight abolition of hereditary peers as Labour’s Lords reforms stallRead moreConservative peers have determinedly delayed the bill, talking up the merits of hereditary peers’ contributions to lawmaking, and putting downdozens of amendments, with alternative proposals, which have gummed up the Lords withtwo days of debate this week.Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister for the constitution, described the removal of the hereditary peers as “a landmark reform”when introducing the legislationin September. “The hereditary principle in lawmaking has lasted for too long and is out of step with modern Britain,” he said. “The second chamber plays a vital role in our constitution and people should not be voting on our laws in parliament by an accident of birth.”But the last time Labour resolved to remove hereditary peers, when Tony Blair won the general election in 1997, the party itself was responsible for compromising; it agreed to retain 92 earls, barons and dukes. That stalled process is a cautionary tale about the obstacles to Lords reform, particularly given Labour has said in its manifesto that it has ambitious plans to ultimatelyreplace the Lordswith a modernised second chamber that represents the UK’s nations and regions.Blair’s government capitulated in 1999 to a threat made by Tories in the Lords to block legislation if the measure was enacted without further changes.Labourthen agreed the deal whereby most hereditary peers, 667, were removed, but the sub-group of 92 was retained. This was to be temporary until a second stage of promised Lords changes. That never happened. From 2010, Conservative prime ministers made clear they had no intention of changing the Lords, so 92 hereditary peers have remained in the chamber for another quarter of a century.A process to maintain that number also persisted, despite peers in both main parties variously criticising it as a “farce” and “ludicrous”. When a sitting hereditary peer died or retired, “byelections” were held to replace them. The only candidates in the byelections were other hereditary peers in the same party who had been removed in 1999, or their children, and the only people able to vote were sitting hereditary peers from the same party as the peer being replaced.Two of the 92 hereditary peers, who hold the ceremonial offices of earl marshal and lord great chamberlain, will remain after Starmer’s changes, but not as voting members.View image in fullscreenRobert Gascoyne-Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, in 2009.Photograph: Tim Scrivener/ShutterstockRobert Gascoyne-Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, who was the Conservative leader of the upper house in 1999, acknowledges that he secured the compromise and retention of the smaller group. He threatened toblock legislation, but now sayshe had no intention of carrying out his threat ashe believed inLords reform. Salisbury says he argued for retaining some hereditary peers as an irritant that would encourage Blair’s government to do more, and described as “bullshit” the arguments he and colleagues used to justify the figure of 92.“If the government had held their nerve I would have crumbled, but they didn’t,” he said. “I thought the 92 hereditary peers might last only a few more months, not 26 years.”The Labour peer Bruce Grocott, who was a Downing Street adviser in 1999, says the government took Salisbury’s threat seriously.“We couldn’t take the risk,” he said. “The act retaining the 92 hereditary peers was passed under duress.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hereditary peers have argued in debates that they are independent because they are not there by prime ministerial appointment, that many work hard, and if they are to be removed, it should be as part of wider changes.Malcolm Sinclair, the Earl of Caithness, whosefamily title dates from 1455, described the legislation as a “spiteful little bill”when it was debatedin December. Tory and hereditary peers then put downthe bulging series of amendmentsthat have taken up so much parliamentary time. But given the convention that the Lords does not block a government’s manifesto commitments, the bill will become law.The general impression of hereditary peers has long been that their titles, like that of Caithness, are ancient legacies of pre-democratic times, granted by a monarch centuries ago. Many of the 92 are in this aristocratic category, including the Duke of Norfolk, currently Edward William Fitzalan-Howard, a peerage originally granted in 1312 by Edward II; and the Earl of Shrewsbury, Charles Henry John Benedict Crofton Chetwynd Chetwynd-Talbot, the 22nd holder of a title first created in 1074. But most in the Lords are not of that tradition; hereditary peerages continued to be created until 1984, when the former Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillan was ennobled as the Earl of Stockton.David Hanson, when he was a Labour MP, was a perennial critic of hereditary peers remaining in the Lords, and singled out the 3rd Earl Attlee as “perhaps the worst example”. John Attlee sits as a Conservative, having inherited the peerage given to his grandfather Clement Attlee, a Labour prime minister whose 1945-51 government introduced the NHS and the welfare state.View image in fullscreenJohn Attlee, Earl Attlee.Photograph: Yui Mok/PA“It beggars belief to think that the first Earl Attlee – a Labour prime minister who implemented some of the most dramatic reforms in Britain’s history – would have sat in the House of Lords and voted the same way as his grandson will today,”Hanson said in a 2016 speech.Hansonlost his Commons seatin the 2019 general election, and in July last year was himself appointed to the Lords by Starmer, who made him a Home Office minister.Attlee said he respects Hanson’s right to raise the point. Like other hereditary peers, he defended his tenure.“Once the legislation comes into full effect, all the peers on the political benches will owe their position in parliament to knowing someone in the Westminster bubble,” he said.Grocott acquired some renown within the Lords for speaking with a scathing wit when he repeatedly proposed bills to abolish the hereditary peer byelections, but they never passed. Now the 92 are to be removed, Grocott said: “People joke with me and ask what I’ll do with my life now this is finally happening. I have to admit to a certain satisfaction at being part of a campaign that has reached a conclusion, and has finally settled the fairly basic principle – that you can’t be a legislator by birth.”Explore more on these topicsLords reformThe Lords debateLabourHouse of LordsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The appointment to the finance ministry of the popular US-educated computer scientist Kyriakos Pierrakakis is also seen as injecting an air of regeneration into a government in its sixth year in office. Pierrakakis, 42, who moves from the education ministry, is from the centre-left.But commentators said with Mitsotakis confronting growing criticism from supporters of his own centre-right New Democracy party, the reshuffle was also aimed at solidifying his traditional conservative base.“It’s as much about reinforcing his control over his own parliamentary group and sending the message that from now on there’ll be a more conservative, hardline stance on migration,” said the European affairs analyst Yannis Koutsomitis. “It’s also a clear signal toEuropeand Washington that ‘we’re on the same wavelength’.”Once caught on camera wielding an axe as he chased leftist fellow students, Voridis, 60, emerged on the political scene as the head of the youth wing of Epen, the far-right party founded by the former dictator Georgios Papadopoulos. With a seat in the European parliament, the group enjoyed close ties with France’s late National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, openly espousing many of his extremist views.Voridishas long depicted Muslim immigrants as a threat to Europeand the social cohesion of Greece, a frontline EU member state that has seen successive waves of incoming asylum seekers over the past decade.On Friday the leftwing opposition Syriza party described the reshuffle as “an insult to Greek society”.The prominent anti-racist group Keerfa said the appointment of Voridis signalled a far-right turn, and predicted mass deportations at a time when New Democracy’s appeal had dwindled amid persistent claims that the government had “covered up” the train disaster. “[His] appointment shows that it will try to use racism and an opening to the far right to deal with the anger,” it said, arguing that with Donald Trump back in power the ruling party “saw opportunities” in adopting policies that would help pick up votes lost to parties on the far right.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With general elections not due until 2027, political analysts say there is still time to win back public confidence but few believe Friday’s changes will be enough to stem popular anger. “It is uncertain whether such changes would alter people’s perception of the government or make it more effective,” said the political analyst Costas Panagopoulos.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropeThe far rightMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

In addition, the Royal Institution is asking people to share their memories of attending the Christmas Lectures and Ri Discourses.Aderin-Pocock is also hoping to mine the institution’s archives for clips from previous years, including the lectures by the American astronomer Carl Sagan, to explore how understanding of space has changed.Key among the missions challenging current theories is the James WebbSpaceTelescope (JWST), which was launched on Christmas Day 2021. With its huge 18-segment mirror the telescope acts like a time machine, capturing light from distant galaxies that – because light travels at a finite speed – was produced when the universe was still young.“One of the things that it’s discovering is that galaxies seem to be bigger than we anticipated in the early universe,” said Aderin-Pocock. The discovery has thrown up a host of questions, including whether the laws of physics are constant and whether dark matter really exists.For Aderin-Pocock, the JWST is personal: she worked on one of its instruments knownas the Near-Infrared Spectrograph.Butthe mission is facing budget cuts of up to 20%– and that is before the US Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), overseen by the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, hasfinished scrutinising Nasa.For Aderin-Pocock the role of Musk – who is CEO of the space technology company Space X – in assessing the agency is a conflict of interest.“It’s an odd stance to take to have Musk looking at this, because you need someone independent, you need someone with distance from this. And to me, ideally, someone from a different arena, so that they aren’t caught up in all the baggage that we carry around when we work in an industry, but bring a new light to it,” she said. “And so the fact that Elon Musk is involved in this seems like a bad idea to me.”And while Aderin-Pocock is excited that the commercialisation of space –something she labels the “battle of the billionaires” – could hasten her dream of space travel, she said legislation is crucial.“Sometimes it feels a bit like the wild west where people are doing what they want out there, and without the proper constraints I think we could make a mess again,” she said. “And again, if there is an opportunity to utilise space for the benefit of humanity, let it be for all of humanity.”Yet, like Musk, she is keen for crewed missions to other planets. “I won’t say it’s our destiny because that sounds a bit weird, but I think it is our future,” she said. “We live on our planet and, I don’t want to sound scary, but planets can be vulnerable.”Aderin-Pocock notes that an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, and while humans are now keeping an eye on space rocks coming close to Earth, they are not the only hazard that could decimate humanity.“So I think it makes sense to look out there to where we might have other colonies – on the moon, on Mars and then beyond as well,” she said.The Christmas Lectures from the Royal Institution supported by CGI will be broadcast on the BBC and iPlayer in late DecemberExplore more on these topicsSpaceRoyal InstitutionNasaSpaceXnewsShareReuse this content"

The former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy called Zeldin’s announcement “the most disastrous day in EPA history”.The warning by McCarthy, who served under two Democratic administrations, was echoed by two former EPA heads who served under Republican presidents.Trump officials decimate climate protections and consider axeing key greenhouse gas findingRead moreZeldin’s comprehensive plan to undo decades-old regulations was nothing short of a “catastrophe” and “represents the abandonment of a long history” of EPA actions to protect the environment, said William K Reilly, who led the agency under President George HW Bush and played a key role in amending the Clean Air Act in 1990.“What this administration is doing is endangering all of our lives – ours, our children, our grandchildren,” added Christine Todd Whitman, who led the EPA under President George W Bush. “We all deserve to have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. If there’s an endangerment finding to be found anywhere, it should be found on this administration because what they’re doing is so contrary to what the Environmental Protection Agency is about.”Whitman was referring to one of the major actions Zeldin announced: to reconsider a scientific finding that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The agency’s 2009 finding has been the legal underpinning for most US action against climate change, including regulations for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources.Environmentalists and climate scientists call the endangerment finding a bedrock of US law and say any attempt to undo it will have little chance of success.Trump officials decimate climate protections and consider axeing key greenhouse gas findingRead moreWhitman and the other former agency heads said they were stunned that theTrump administrationwould even try to undo the finding and a host of other longtime agency rules. If approved, the rule changes could cause “severe harms” to the environment, public health and the economy, they said.“This EPA administrator now seems to be doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry more than complying with the mission of the EPA,” said McCarthy, who led the agency under President Barack Obama and was a top climate adviser to President Joe Biden.McCarthy and the other two retired leaders emphasized that environmental protection and economic prosperity were not mutually exclusive, saying strong regulations had enabled both a cleaner environment and a growing economy since the agency’s founding 55 years ago.An EPA spokesperson, Molly Vaseliou, said thatDonald Trump“advanced conservation and environmental stewardship while promoting economic growth for families across the country” in his first term “and will continue to do so this term”.Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, rolled back more than 100 environmental laws in his first term as president. He campaigned on a promise to “drill, baby, drill” and vowed to ease regulations on fossil fuel companies. In his current term, he has frozen funds for climate programs and other environmental spending, fired scientists working for the National Weather Service and cut federal support for renewable energy.Reilly said he feared that Zeldin and Trump, influenced by the billionaire Elon Musk and his government-cutting agency, would return to a pre-EPA era when industry was free to pollute virtually at will, filling the air in many cities with dangerous smog and rivers with industrial waste.Judge demands ‘some kind of evidence’ from Trump’s EPA to halt climate grantsRead more“I wonder if the malefactors are going to give us more burning rivers,” Reilly said. The comment was a reference to an infamous 1969 incident in which Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River caught fire, spurring passage of the federal Clean Water Act and creation of the EPA a year later during the administration of the Republican president Richard Nixon.The former EPA administrators published an op-ed in the New York Times last month warning of likely environmental harm as the Trump administration imposes funding freezes, cuts spending and fires more than a thousand employees. In a statement on Friday, they said the plan to undo environmental rules “sets the country on a course that will cause irreparable harm to Americans, businesses and environmental protection efforts nationwide”.Regulations are hard to make – intentionally so, McCarthy said. “They’re difficult. They take a lot of effort, which is why I think most of us are scratching our heads as to why we’d really want to keep rethinking what has fundamentally been working.”Zeldin, in announcing the rule changes, said, Trump officials “are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion and ushering in America’s Golden Age”.Among the changes are plans to rewrite a rule restricting air pollution from fossil-fuel-fired power plants and a separate measure restricting emissions from cars and trucks. Zeldin and the Republican president incorrectly label the car rule as an electric vehicle “mandate.″Biden’s Democratic administration had said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting the reliable, long-term supply of electricity that America needs. Biden, who made fighting climate change a top priority of his presidency, pledged that half of all new cars and trucks sold in the US will be zero-emission by 2030.The EPA also will take aim at rules restricting industrial pollution of mercury and other air toxins, soot pollution and a “good neighbor” rule intended to restrict smokestack emissions that burden downwind areas with smog. Zeldin also targeted a clean water law that provides federal protections for rivers, streams and wetlands.Environmentalists have vowed to fight the changes, which one group said would result in “the greatest increase in pollution in decades″ in the US.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS Environmental Protection AgencyPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

The BNPL market is projected to surpass $160bn by 2032, with retailers such as Walmart, Target and Amazon joining fintech firms such as Klarna, Affirm and Block to offer the service and attract younger, credit-averse shoppers.Klarna reported a profit of $21m, or 1 cent a share, in 2024, compared with a loss of $244m, or 69 cents a share, a year ago.Its CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, had considered a direct listing – a route that avoids selling new shares and the costs of a traditional IPO – in 2021. But the Sequoia Capital-backed company shelved the plan and instead raised funds at a sharply reduced $6.7bn valuation.The latest move comes as stock market volatility, driven by renewed recession fears and uncertainty over Donald Trump’s tariffs, threatens to stall a recovery in the IPO market.The company has partnered with major global brands, including cosmetics retailer Sephora, sporting goods giant Nike and rental booking platform Airbnb.It expects to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol KLAR.

Tornado threats loomed for the Mississippi valley into the night and the deep south on Saturday.An approaching wildfire fueled by dry grasses and spread by strong winds prompted emergency officials to urge residents to evacuate Leedey,Oklahoma, a town of about 400 people. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma state patrol said on the social platform X that dusty winds toppled several tractor-trailers.“This is terrible out here,” Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48ft trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma, said of the high winds whipping up dust. “There’s a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I’m not pushing it over 55mph. I’m scared it will blow over if I do.”Forecasters said the severe storm threat would continue into the weekend with a high chance of tornadoes and damaging winds on Saturday inMississippiand Alabama. Heavy rain could bring flash flooding to some parts of the east coast on Sunday.Experts say it is not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.California atmospheric river threatens flooding in areas still reeling from firesRead more“What’s unique about this one is its large size and intensity,” said Bill Bunting of the weather service’s Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. “And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area.”The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn tornadoes and hail as large as baseballs on Friday. But the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with some gusts possibly reaching 100mph.A tornado watch was issued until 11pm for central and easternMissouri, including St Louis, as well as parts of Illinois and Arkansas.Forecasters said areas also at risk included parts of Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. About 47 million people faced an enhanced to moderate severe storm threat from Madison, Wisconsin, to Birmingham,Alabama.Forecasters grew increasingly worried that intense thunderstorms farther south would probably bring an even greater tornado threat on Saturday.The Storm Prediction Center said parts of Mississippi including Jackson and Hattiesburg and areas of Alabama including Birmingham and Tuscaloosa will be at a high risk of damaging winds and tornadoes. Severe storms and tornadoes are also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle.“We have a lot of confidence that we most likely will have a tornado outbreak tomorrow,” the Storm Prediction Center meteorologist Evan Bentley said in an online briefing on Friday.Wildfires in the southern plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds.A blaze in Roberts county,Texas, north-east of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 sq km) to an estimated 12.5 sq miles, the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X.The Oklahoma emergency management department activated its emergency operations center after several fast-moving fires that prompted evacuations of the town of Leedey in the western part of the state and in a rural area east of Norman.High winds also knocked out power to more than 210,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, according the websitepoweroutage.us.Meanwhile, the National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3-6in (7.5 to 15m) were expected, with up to a foot (30cm) possible.Winds gusting to 60mph into Saturday afternoon were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Combined with a light glaze of ice that could fall in some places before the temperature drops, travel conditions in the area could be treacherous that day, the weather service said.Thewinter blastcontinued after snowfall of up to 3ft blanketed the Sierra Nevada earlier in the week.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherExtreme weatherTexasOklahomaWildfiresUS wildfiresTornadoesnewsShareReuse this content"

In a report filed that day, an officer said attempts to identify the owners of the damaged cars were unsuccessful and he had them towed “as they were filled with property, and I wanted to avoid further vandalism or thefts”.On 6 December, a month later, a yard worker at the tow lot noticed a “pungent smell” in the van and alerted authorities. Police and fire department officials found Cameroni De Adams “wedged under miscellaneous items in the vehicle’s middle row”, the medical examiner’s office said in its autopsy. Her body was decomposed, and authorities said her cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.The family’s claim asserts that she had “sustained severe but survivable blunt force injuries from the collision that required medical attention”, and that police left her “trapped inside of her vehicle without necessary care” and she could have been saved if officers had hospitalized her.“For my clients to have to live with the knowledge that their mom was towed away alive from the scene of a wreck only to die in a tow yard alone is incredibly difficult,” said John C Carpenter, the family’s attorney. “It would not have been difficult to see if there was somebody inside. It’s just basic common decency that you would check to see what’s inside a vehicle before you tow it away … They buried her alive in her car.”The case shines a harsh light on the dangers facing unhoused people sleeping in rough conditions in California, which in recent years has been home to roughlyhalf of all unsheltered peoplein the US living on the streets. More than6,000 peoplein the San Diego region werecountedliving in tents and vehicles and other makeshift structures last year.The news of Cameroni De Adams’s death comes the same week as a report in Vallejo, a Bay Area city, revealed howJames Edward Oakley, a 58-year-old unhoused man, wascrushed to deathduring a municipal trash cleanup last year.The claim filed by Cameroni De Adams’s children, the first step in litigation, calls for $50m in damages and accuses the city and its police officers of wrongful death, negligence, infliction of emotional distress and “tortious interference with human remains”.Cameroni De Adams’s family had sent her birthday wishes on 13 November, a week after the crash, and became alarmed when she didn’t respond and they couldn’t find her van, prompting them to file a missing person’s report the next day, according to the claim and autopsy report. Roughly a week later, authorities told the family her car had been located, but she was still missing, Carpenter said.The autopsy said the woman had been living in her van in the San Diego area for seven years, and Carpenter said he was not able to share more details about her life.“She was loved. She was an important part of their family. She mattered,” said the lawyer, adding that it seemed the officers at the collision scene assumed the vehicle belonged to an unhoused person and treated the car and its owner as “worthless”: “I can’t imagine a situation where an officer doesn’t look for a person inside a vehicle that’s involved in a wreck. The only thing I can think of is that our unhealthy prejudices against unhoused people made the police officer just not care about this vehicle as much as he should have. That’s a sad and dangerous thing.”Spokespeople for the police department and city attorney’s office declined to comment on pending litigation.Nearly500 unsheltered people diedin San Diego county last year, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune, including from overdoses, the most common cause, as well as from hypothermia and impacts from floods. Thirty unhoused people died when they were struck by vehicles and seven were killed by trains, the paper found.Older and elderly adultsincreasingly forced to live on the streetsin California are particularly vulnerable to health problems and violence. In May 2023, Annette Pershal, a 68-year-old unhoused San Diego woman waskilled when a teenager shot herwith a pellet gun at her camping spot. She was known to locals as “Granny Annie”, her daughtertelling the Guardian: “She was a person, not just a thing to be used for target practice. Her life mattered.”Explore more on these topicsSan DiegoCaliforniaHomelessnessWest CoastHousingSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

The standoff lasted until late on Wednesday, whenthe army said 33 hijackers had been killed.Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest and least populated province. Baloch residents have long accused the central government of discrimination – a charge Islamabad denies.The attack on the train has drawn international condemnation, including from the US, China, Turkey, Iran and the UK. On Friday, the members of the UN security council said it “condemned in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack”.The council said in a statement: “The members of the security council underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.”At a news conference in Islamabad on Friday, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmad Sharif said “in this terrorist incident in Balochistan, and others before, the main sponsor is your eastern neighbour,” referring toIndia.He offered no proof to support the accusation, which has been rejected by India. It was the first time the BLA – which has been fighting for independence and a greater share of the province’s resources – had hijacked a train, although it had attacked trains before.Some attackers had escaped and a search operation was under way to find them, Sharif said. He also said most of the fatalities were security forces protecting the passengers and troops travelling to their home cities.Sarfraz Bugti, the chief minister of Balochistan, told reporters that Pakistan has “solid evidence” of India’s involvement in attacks. He did not share any specific information.Sharif added that an Indian naval officer arrested in 2016 and convicted of espionage in Pakistan had worked for Indian intelligence to assist the Baloch separatists and other militant groups. The officer, identified as Kulbhushan Jadhav, has been sentenced to death. Sharif, however, did not link him directly to the latest train attack.Pakistan and India are nuclear-armed rivals with a history of bitter relations. They have fought four wars since they gained independence in 1947 from Britain.“We strongly reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan,” India’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, said.Earlier, Pakistan’s foreign ministry had claimed the train attack was orchestrated from Afghanistan, where the attackers had been in contact with handlers. Kabul denied the accusation and said the BLA had no presence there.Pakistan has suspended all train services to and from Balochistan since Tuesday’s attack. Sharif Ullah, a railway official, said repairs to the tracks, which were blown up to stop the train, had not started.Survivors have recounted their harrowing ordeal during the 36-hour hijacking.Muhammad Farooq, from Quetta, the largest city in Balochistan, described how the BLA stopped the train and ordered passengers to disembark.“They checked identity cards and started killing people who worked for the armed forces,” he said. Many passengers, he said, fled successfully while the hijackers were exchanging fire with Pakistani troops.Mohammad Tanveer, who was travelling from Quetta to the eastern city of Lahore, said he was wounded but managed to escape. He said the attackers had been looking for members of the military and security forces, and started killing them in small groups, one after another.Nair Husnain, a student, said he saw the militants go through the train, asking people to stand up and tying their hands before shooting them several times. They first killed soldiers, then minority Shias and Punjabis. Balochs were spared, he said.He also recounted how a woman travelling with her three sons – all soldiers – had to watch as they were shot and killed.“Those scenes are still before my eyes,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPakistanIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

But at 23, a shock diagnosis changed her worldFri 14 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 10.41 EDTShareMarisa Abela finds it very difficult to go to the gym. Not for the usual reasons – lack of time or motivation – but because she says the reception she gets there is “insane”. The actor lives near the City of London, and her local gym is nestled between the gigantic, glinting glass offices of the capital’s financial district – which also happens to be the natural habitat of Yasmin Kara-Hanani, the hyper-privileged and extravagantly troubled junior banker Abela plays in the hit BBC dramaIndustry. And it’s not just while she’s exercising – that swarm of real‑life bankers desperate to tell Abela how much they love the show means meals out can be an issue, too. “If I tried to go to a salad bar at lunchtime in the City …” she trails off, looking slightly dazed.Abela isn’t just highly recognisable for her part in Industry, a satire of the reckless, hedonistic, egomaniac-littered world of finance that since its 2020 debut has blossomed from niche concern to TV’s spiciest workplace drama. The 28-year-old also gets stopped in the street for being “the girl who played Amy Winehouse”. (Recently, people have finally started to ask her if she is Marisa. “And I’m like, ‘Yes, I am!’” she says, with mock grandeur.) Last year, she starred inBack to Black, Sam Taylor-Johnson’s biopic of the late singer, an oddly paced film rescued by Abela’s performance, which combines Winehouse’s trademark wit and stubborn iconoclasm with an endearing vulnerability. In her hands, Amy was, above all, a doting daughter and an adorably guileless romantic.View image in fullscreenWith Harry Lawtey in Industry …Photograph: BBC/Bad Wolf ProductionsView image in fullscreen… and Jack O’Connell in Back to Black.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyAs an actor, sweetness is Abela’s USP: Industry’s Yasmin could have easily ended up being a man-eating mean girl had Abela not softened her into a wide-eyed, insecurity-riddled underdog. And, today, as soon as the actor pops her head in to ask permission to eat her supermarket salad during our interview, it becomes clear that sweetness is her defining quality off screen, too. It’s Valentine’s Day – or, more importantly, T-minus two days to the Baftas, where she has been nominated for the rising star award – and Abela is (politely) squeezing eating opportunities into a packed schedule of photoshoots and dress fittings. Dinner, however, is safeguarded: she’s going for a romantic meal with Jamie Bogyo, her actor-writer boyfriend – sorry,fiance. “I hate that word, but he gets annoyed when I call him my boyfriend,” she laughs.In the event, Abela didn’t take home the Bafta – it went to her erstwhile Industry co-star David Jonsson. But it doesn’t matter; the actor doesn’t need a statuette to prove she’s a star in the making. Among her fans isSteven Soderbergh, who cast her in his new London-set spy thriller Black Bag based solely on her performance in Industry. Abela had prepared for what she thought was an audition for the part of smart-but-naive spook Clarissa. “But as soon as I logged on to Zoom, Steven said: ‘The part is yours if you want it.’ I was like, whoa!” says Abela, sitting on an office chair in a small London photography studio, de-glammed yet still elegant in a long brown dress, chunky black boots and black cardigan.She went to dinner with co-stars Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender: ‘I looked around and thought, this is insane’Being handpicked by Soderbergh was even more flattering considering the calibre of the rest of the cast: Black Bag also stars Cate Blanchett, Michael Fassbender and Pierce Brosnan. Before shooting began, all the actors went for dinner in London. “I was looking around the table, like, this is fucking insane.” How on earth do you make general chitchat with that lot? “No,literally,” she nods, eyes wide. “Some people were talking about AI at one point and I was just …” her face telegraphs panicked bafflement.If they were Industry fans, her dining companions were probably just as excited about meeting her. When the show began, Yasmin was one of many cogs in the narrative machine, but she became the show’s emotional core, following a sensational third series focusing on her relationship with her vile father. The character is arguably among the most fascinating women to have graced our TV screens: both calculating and credulous, as well as haughty and, in Abela’s words, “anxious to please”. In real life, Abela has observed a type of London rich kid “for whom the red carpet just rolls out in front of them and they don’t need to worry about anything. Yasmin’s never really had that energy. She’s incredibly privileged, obviously, but, because I’m playing her, she has a little bit more uneasiness.”Abela is referring to her own childhood. She grew up in Rottingdean, a village near Brighton, with parents who were both performers – but it wasn’t exactly a nepo baby situation. Her mother, Caroline Gruber, was an actor, appearing in TV shows such as Grange Hill and The Bill throughout the 1980s and 90s, but scaled back her career to look after Abela and her elder brother, Jack, and eventually ended up working in a call centre rather than taking on acting roles that would mean leaving her children for long periods. (She’s currently “crushing it”, Abela says, in a later-life return to the job.)View image in fullscreenPhotographer: Chantel King/The Guardian. Dress and gloves: Dior. Ear cuffs: Carolina de BarrosAbela’s parents split up when she was four; her dad, Angelo, had been in a comedy double act called the Vicious Boys, who appeared frequently on late-1980s kids’ telly. Abela has watched everything of his that’s available on YouTube – including “an advert for Twirl where he’s got a big mullet” – but “he’s either thrown away, burned or hiding any more footage than that”. By the time she was born, her dad had turned to directing (his credits include Hollyoaks and My Parents Are Aliens).It was Abela’s education that placed her cheek by jowl with some of the wealthiest children in the country. She won a drama scholarship to the “very exclusive” Roedean school in East Sussex, where she was humiliated for her lack of wealth (her peers mocked the small bungalow she lived in, for example). One birthday, a schoolfriend picked her up “in a blacked-out Bentley and her chauffeur drove us to Harrods. Her dad met us there and said, ‘Pick out anything you want for your birthday.’”It was close to Christmas and the pets section had “a stocking for dogs, and I was like: ‘Oh, I’m gonna get this for my dog.’ I was so overwhelmed and confused – I was 11 years old.” Her re-enactment of a young girl panickedly purchasing a dog’s stocking instead of some designer clothes makes me laugh out loud – which, I quickly realise, was not quite the intended response; Abela’s eyes remain saucer-like as she continues to recount her naivety. “I didn’t know what these brands were, or what things cost. I just remember going home at night and bawling my eyes out, being like, I don’t get it.”There was one upside. Witnessing how the other half lived gave her the ability to “code-switch”, she says. It was a skill honed when swapping between her mum’s and dad’s homes and the cultures of their extended families (her mother is from a Jewish background – something that gave her an affinity with Winehouse; the opening scenes inBack to Black“felt like a Friday night I’d been at before in north-west London” – while her dad is of Maltese and Libyan heritage).At 13, Abela played Dolly Levi in a school production of The Matchmaker. As she came off stage, her mum said: “You’re an actor.” She didn’t totally buy it – “I remember being like, well, she would say that” – but her teachers agreed. Did her dad encourage her, too? She pauses to think. “I mean, encouraging is maybe the wrong word. I think he was more … My dad was incredibly proud whenever he saw me on stage – he’s a very emotional man. My mum will be like, ‘You can do this.’ My dad will just be a weeping mess.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Chantel King/The Guardian. Dress: Emilia Wickstead. Shoes: Gina for 16Arlington. Earrings and ring: Misho (fuller outfit seen in top image)Even with glowing endorsements from her mum and her teachers, Abela felt she needed a “seal of approval from a school like Rada” in order to pursue acting professionally. She didn’t get in the first time – instead she spent her gap year on a sustainability programme in Fiji (“cleaning coral and scuba diving; it was kind of amazing”). She planned to take up the place she had been offered to study history at University College London if she was rejected a second time – but there was no need. She was still at Rada when she landed the part of Yasmin.Soon, however, that impeccably launched career came to an abrupt halt. Filming wrapped on series one of Industry in December 2019; by spring the country was in lockdown and Abela feared her career momentum was draining away. “And then I really wasn’t feeling well. I thought I had Covid, and then I thought I had long Covid because I was not able to get out of bed and I didn’t know what was going on. I remember calling 111 and they were like, ‘What’s your address?’ And I burst into tears, because I didn’t know. It was like I had brain fog; I couldn’t think straight.” Abela saw a doctor, who found a large lump in her neck and thought it was a swollen lymph node. But she was so “freaked out” that she paid for a private ultrasound, “and the guy was like, ‘Oof.’” She got the results of the biopsy at her mum’s house in Brighton. “They said, ‘It’s thyroid cancer.’ It was just shock.”Aged 23, she was categorised as a young adult under the NHS, meaning her treatment was “sped up. And I had my own teenage cancer nurse with me through everything. That was great because no one else could come to the hospital with me because it was Covid.” She had an eight-hour operation to remove the tumour, and later radiotherapy. “Now I go in every three months for my blood tests and my checkups.”The diagnosis was terrifying, Abela says, but the continuing psychological toll has been “scarier”. When she got the diagnosis, she “slipped into game mode. I was like, ‘OK, what do we do? Let’s fix this as soon as possible.’” Ever since then she gets anxious about every twinge. “As women, our body works in this very efficient cycle and we’re told that pain is normal, but, after having something like that, the normal things that people get month to month freak me out.”At the same time, the cliche about surviving a serious illness is also true. “I do have clarity on the most important things in a way that I didn’t as a 23-year-old, and now health is always at the forefront of my mind.” Actually, she corrects herself, the shadow does sometimes lift and she forgets. “And then it’s like, ‘Oh shit, I’ve got my appointment in a few days’, and you get nervous.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She clearly prides herself on the “stamina” that allowed her to go straight from Back to Black to Industry – “a six-month job on to another six-month job – I was in every single scene of Back to Black, so I was shooting every day, and I was fine!” By her standards, at least. “Maybe if you spoke to Jamie or my mum, they’d have been, ‘No, she was really tired and needed a break.’ But had I booked the perfect next job that started shooting two days after Industry wrapped, I’d have done it – without a doubt.”It’s a feat that is even more impressive considering the demands of playing Winehouse. There was the physical metamorphosis: the weight she lost to emulate the dishevelled waif-like look of the musician’s later years. Abela felt conflicted when people in the industry complimented her on her unnaturally skinny frame and is still unsure how much the experience affected her own body image. “I don’t know how well I did or didn’t do at being sucked into that whole weight-loss thing. There were some days where I found it difficult and there were some days where I was empowered by it.”Then there was the psychological strain of being involved in such a controversial project. Some felt a biopic was too soon and too exploitative; some fan communities were in uproar about Abela’s lack of physical resemblance to Winehouse. Did she find it easy to avoid the commentary? “No! But I think I’m quite good at understanding where things are coming from. I don’t necessarily internalise things that I don’t think are about me. I know that there was a connection I had to Amy that was authentic – maybe not in every way or in the specific way that some fans felt that they needed to see, but I know I connected to something.” She did, however, feel “very exposed for the first time in my life and that did shift something in me in terms of a self-preservation vibe”, she says, matter-of-factly. “I know there are so many jobs that are hard work, but this industry can be really, really crushing emotionally and it’s incredibly exposing. It’s not necessarily a natural existence.”Industry required a more literal kind of exposure: from the start, Yasmin’s dynamic – with practically everyone – was highly sexualised. By the end of series three, we uncover a disturbing root cause. Abela didn’t know this explicitly before she read that episode’s script, but she and the show’s writers, Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, had been laying the groundwork for years. “I remember when we were speaking in those first rehearsals I said, ‘Yasmin is one of those women that absolutely sees herself through the male gaze and I think that comes from her relationship with her father.’” By series two it was obvious that “he had an inappropriate relationship to her body”.Building this psychological portrait entailed many sex scenes and a fair amount of nudity – something Abela isn’t over-keen to repeat. “I never want it to come across like I was made to do anything I didn’t want to do”; in fact, she says, she was “kind of excited in season one. It was part of the vibe of the show, it was liberating.” But then the papers started covering it. “It was weird for me to be 22 and on a front page that said: ‘We didn’t recognise you with your clothes on’, or whatever. I think I thought it was funny at the time – I was just so shocked. But now I don’t find it so funny.”During the early days of filming, she believed she was so young and inexperienced that “no one would really care” about her nudity preferences. In the past, says Abela, she has conflated doing her job well with being “easy” to work with – but being objectified in a way she hadn’t foreseen prompted her to put her foot down.View image in fullscreenWith Michael Fassbender in Black Bag.Photograph: Claudette Barius/Focus Features © 2025Series four of Industry is filming imminently, and Yasmin may be slightly more buttoned-up this time anyway. The end of series three saw her make a strategic – and life-changing – decision in her romantic life, one that has Abela excited “to play a slightly different side” of Yasmin. “For the last two seasons she’s had nothing to lose, she’s already at rock bottom – but now she’s not at rock bottom. I want to see her be more composed.”In a meta twist, the final scene of the last series features a cameo from Bogyo. Was it a one-off? “I hope not, I hope it leads on to some huge affair,” she grins. “No, I actually don’t know.” Between her family and her fiance, whom she met at Rada, she seems to be surrounded by actors. Does she live in a thespian bubble? “I have a whole world that is not acting-related, because Jamie went to Yale first. So a lot of his friends are lawyers and bankers and artists and gallerists. And I love hanging out with them because they couldn’t give less of a shit about what I do. We just talk about random things and it’s fun.”Abela, on the other hand, cares very deeply about what she does – and the impression she leaves on her colleagues. Despite her success, she remains hyper-focused on proving herself – on Black Bag she worried her starry castmates might be thinking, “Oh look, she’s won a raffle ticket and gets to be on set with us” – and stresses that her “number one goal every single day on set is for people to think I’m doing a good job as an actor”, something that reminds me of Yasmin’s absolute dedication to even the lowliest of tasks on Industry.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Chantel King/The Guardian.

Her new goal is to be more proactive – “like writing an email to a director and saying, ‘I would love to work with you one day.’”She is still a Briton, though. “I think it’s very hard for British people – I find it very difficult – to put yourself up on a silver platter because it feels gauche or like you’re going to get rejected.” She’s “getting better at advocating for myself”; her people-pleasing days are numbered. She steels herself. “At a certain point, the regret of not doing a thing is worse than the fear of rejection.”Black Bag is in cinemasfrom14 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmSteven SoderberghBack to BlackBBCDramaTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why not? It is a deliciously satirical creation: dark, silly and utterly delightful. It sends up not only a genre of musicals that feature teen love across the divide, from West Side Story to Grease, but acerbically pokes fun at Wasp-y values and America itself – from its constitution to its sense of exceptionalism.This first professional UK production was long overdue, and in director Mehmet Ergen’s hands it is a firecracker of a show – faster, funnier and more intelligent than so much other retro teen musical fare in the West End.It takes us to Baltimore, where the upper-class “squares” are at war with the leather-clad “drapes” – though they rather ridiculously enact their enmity through singing battles. The titular rebel Wade “Cry-Baby” Walker (Adam Davidson), in his sleeveless leather jerkin and bandana, is a drape while “good girl” Allison (Lulu-Mae Pears) is the square who instantly falls for him.View image in fullscreenLove across the class divide … Adam Davidson and Lulu-Mae Pears as Cry-Baby and Allison.Photograph: Charlie FlintWhere the 1990 film (starring an electric Johnny Depp) is more absurdist, there is more plot in the adaptation. This is an America that buzzes with McCarthyist anxiety and panic over the atomic bomb. The first scene features a polio inoculation picnic and the reprised song I’m Infected encapsulates not just the infectious nature of love but “respectable” America’s fear of a “diseased” underclass.Performances shine with eyebrow-raised irony. So do the songs by David Javerbaum and Adam Schlesinger. The music is a highly infectious mix of rockabilly, blues and swing, and lyrics explode with gleeful satire and ironies that make you laugh out loud. A small band sit on an exposed mezzanine level and create an astonishing sound.Allison looks like Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz at the start (“My grandmother told me never to loosen up. It’s not upper class”) but gathers shades of Rocky Horror’s Janet as she ventures into sexual rebellion, and Pears has a fabulous singing voice. Davidson matches her in scrubbed-faced wholesomeness as Cry-Baby, despite the bad-boy leathers, and is an impressive dancer.View image in fullscreenChris Whittaker’s choreography is sophisticated in the ensemble numbers.Photograph: Charlie FlintHis posse bring thrilling characterisation too, from pregnant Pepper (Jazzy Phoenix) to “Hatchet-Face” Mona (Kingsley Morton), while Chad Saint Louis as Dupree blows the roof off with songs such as Jukebox Jamboree, as does Eleanor Walsh as Cry-Baby’s stalker, with Screw Loose.It is all as darkly exhilarating as The Producers (the book is co-written by Mark O’Donnell and Thomas Meehan, the latter of whom also wrote the book for Mel Brooks’s musical). And like the most recent London production of that show, this is inventively staged in a modestly sized space, with performers using the entirety of the auditorium. Chris Whittaker’s choreography – an amusingly twirling pastiche – becomes more sophisticated in the ensemble numbers without seeming cramped.Robert Innes Hopkins’ set design is light on its feet, with banners raised and lowered like the American flag for changing scenes, and the star-spangled banner projected on a back wall. And who can fail to feel the bite of the last song, Nothing Bad, which insists that things couldn’t be better in America? The irony carries forward, to chime with America’s endeavour to make itself great again.At theArcola theatre, London, until 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsStageMusicalsArcola theatreJohn WatersTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

He reveals why he had to make a follow-upFri 14 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTShare‘I’ve kept company with very violent people for a very long time,” says documentary-makerDan Reed, in his office whose location has to be kept secret – I was led here, from a decoy address, by the Channel 4 publicist. “I’ve had murderers try to find me. I’ve had people threaten to shoot me who are armed. I’ve been threatened many, many times. I don’t want to say I’m a tough guy, but the needle doesn’t go into the red until I’ve got something quite specific. The threats delivered face to face I took seriously. People trying to find my home address to post me a parcel I took seriously. People in China sending me emails? I don’t take so seriously. They’re going to have to get on a plane.”OK, well hedoessound like a tough guy, or at least a foreign correspondent of the old school, and that’s fair enough. From the Kosovan war (The Valley, 1999) to the Russian mafia (From Russia With Cash, 2015), Reed’s films have long been threaded together by the reasonable fascinations of the hard-hitting documentary-maker – corruption, crime, natural disaster, war.Yet the death threats we’re talking about – and there have been thousands – the ones that urge him to die like a dog in the gutter, or say simply “You’re really disgusting. Go to DEAD. FUCK YOU”, are from Michael Jackson fans, following his2019 film Leaving Neverland. In it, Wade Robson and James Safechuck give detailed, devastatingly plausible accounts of Jackson as a serial paedophile, moving from one seven- or eight-year-old to the next at 12-month intervals, lovebombing them, sexually abusing them, discarding them.View image in fullscreenMan on a mission … Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson director Dan Reed.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe follow-up which airs this week,Leaving Neverland2: Surviving Michael Jackson, is about the fallout from that film, and the awful fact that, when you combine the casual victim-blaming in the mainstream media and the fury of fans, Wade and James have been victimised all over again. We see how they have struggled with depression as adults, particularly since they’ve become fathers themselves. But perhaps more than anything, Surviving Michael Jackson feels like a completely new, feature-length outrage, exploring the attempts of the Jackson estate’s lawyers to keep the allegations from ever reaching open court.Their testimony is graphic and hard to watch. “When I met with James,” remembers Reed, “I said: ‘If we’re going to do this, we have to go there. We have to be absolutely clear, this was sexual abuse. This wasn’t affection gone wrong.’ Wade immediately got that as well. It was going to be absolutely hardcore, no room for ambiguity. Jackson surfed on that ambiguity for his entire life.”‘Andrew Tate greeted us by his pool bare-chested’: Dan Reed on his pursuit of the misogynistRead moreFrom a documentary point of view, it’s almost distracting how famous Jackson was, because Leaving Neverland isn’t about his fame or music or the lavish, childlike lifestyle for which he was known – except to explain the hold he had over the boys’ families, particularly their mothers. Rather, it is an anatomy of grooming, which “doesn’t happen the way we think it does. Your kid has a secret agreement with the predator. It will be very obvious to you what your kid is getting from it: your kid will be excited to see the person, will resist attempts to limit that time, they’re like a teenager in love. To show that, I had to get the guys to say: ‘It was amazing.’ Until it wasn’t.”That is what makes the film petrifying: however much you might judge Robson and Safechuck’s mothers who were often, if not in the room, in the environs when the abuse took place, you can also see how hard it would be to protect your child from a paedophile who wooed them so cynically. Reed – who has four children, ranging from two months to 22 – doesn’t think it’s that complicated: “I don’t care what anyone says or does. I would never, ever allow my child to spend the night in bed with someone who wasn’t a member of the family, and even then …” His demeanour as he interviews Stephanie, James’s mother, and Joy, Wade’s, isn’t studs-first, it’s neutral (in the films, questions are asked off-camera, but you can generally tell how they have been posed). “I loved that quote of Stephanie’s: ‘I had one son, I had one job, and I fucked up.’ Joy is a little more evasive.”Critically, Leaving Neverland was a great success. Robson and Safechuck were astonished and moved by the warm receptions they got at film festivals. They hadn’t expected to be congratulated for their bravery. But they also had strident detractors, on mainstream chatshows, making excuses for Jackson that you can’t imagine anyone making today – and this was only six years ago when #MeToo as a hashtag was in general use.It seems like extremely recent history for anyone to have been uttering the argument that “Jackson was just being affectionate”, says Reed. “In some of the ridiculous media that came out afterwards, that line ‘Maybe they were sharing a bed, and maybe nature took its course, and maybe his penis got hard …’, and you’re thinking, what the fuck?” Others, including Piers Morgan, made an argument less inflammatory but more easily falsifiable: that the pair were money-grabbing. Reed bats this off easily – he says that when Leaving Neverland came out, five more people came forward with allegations, and the estate paid them off with millions of dollars – but you can tell by the way he says “Piers Morgan” that the aspersion vexes him. If the poorer party in a relationship is always thought to be on the make, the logical end point is that rich people can get away with anything.“The thing I’ve never understood,” Reed continues, “is the people who said: ‘[Michael Jackson] never had a childhood, he never grew up.’ Why does not having a childhood entitle you to molest children?” Lawyers acting for the estate, blocking Robson and Safechuck at every turn, are just doing what lawyers do, is Reed’s urbane opinion.View image in fullscreenInnocence lost … Jackson with a five-year-old Wade Robson.Photograph: Channel 4He brings the same shrug-energy to the rage of the diehard fans, who muster mostly online but occasionally spring into real life protesting outside the offices of Channel 4, for instance (who have distributed the films along with HBO). “Nowadays, most people get their information online, and there, people will regularly say: ‘You know Leaving Neverland was debunked, right?’” Does he never find that frustrating? He cares about Wade and James, and has seen at close hand what it has cost them to describe what happened.“In 2019, I’d try to counter it. But you realise it doesn’t matter because those people don’t want to know the truth. They want an excuse to continue being in their tribe, to continue worshipping Michael Jackson. It is a bit of a cult.” And now “we live in a world of disinformation. If I shed a tear every time some piece of disinformation pops up online, I’d be a pile of dust on the floor.”Reed has returned to these themes in films between the Neverland sequence: inThe Truth vs Alex Jones, he tells the story of how disinformation has been monetised; in that case, famously, with the brutal falsehood that the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was a hoax. In Stopping the Steal, covering Trump’s challenge to the 2020 election results, Reed found himself back at the subject of paedophilia. A “hyper-conservative, Mormon politician was asked to throw the election, and he said no – at which point, the online scumosphere starts calling him a paedophile. It’s become this hand grenade that people throw around, and I don’t think that existed in 2019.”He’s currently working on a documentary about the riots last summer after the Southport murders, and describes this curious internationalism that has taken hold – Elon Musk, driving far-right narratives, as well as hosting, on X, the violent content that spurred the real-life violence. “That’s the frontline – cultural spaces where the left cannot go and the right is supreme. That space contains a lot of concerns that ordinary people have, and it contains a lot of madness as well. Whoever is prepared to stand on that hill gets to sing the song they want to sing. The hill is a real place, built on immigration and family values. The liberal social democratic centre steers clear of these hard discussions, which has allowed the right to take the hill.”The splenetic misinformation war waged by the Michael Jackson faithful didn’t launch the far-right, obviously. It took no interest in democratic elections; it was only interested in defending child abuse for the sake of Thriller. But Leaving Neverland 2 is a fascinating and sad account of the sheer complexity of a world in which new norms of bad faith constantly challenge the truth, and make the price of telling it unimaginably high.Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson is on Channel 4 on Tuesday18 Marchat 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionMichael JacksonDocumentaryLeaving NeverlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The duo discuss winning over the mosh pit – and why they’ve banned synthsFri 14 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTShareNova Twins vocalist-guitarist Amy Love is trying to make me feel better about the litany of things that have gone wrong during our one-hour chat. She and her bandmate Georgia South enteredthe shabby-chic dressing room of London’s Omeara in a whirlwind of denim, arraying themselves on the mismatched armchairs after a soundcheck that didn’t entirely go to plan – my Dictaphone broke, South’s battling a cold, I realised I had the wrong notebook with me … We’re all feeling a little frazzled as trains rumble by and South boils the kettle for a Lemsip.The fact chaos swirls around Nova Twins is fitting, perhaps. Their brand of boot-stomping rock takes the pop and R&B music they’d grown up with and distorts it to hell. Nu-metal adjacent, they play a kind of grimy rap-rock with the energy and hooks of the pop end of punk.Their first album as Nova Twins, Who Are the Girls?, was released in 2020 and with lockdown denying them a traditional touring and promo cycle, they threw themselves into writing its follow-up.Supernova(2022) was a rush of brash, powerful adrenaline that catapulted theminto the rock music primetime. They garnered famous fans – Elton John said “These girls rock my world”, Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello told NME they are one of his favourite bands; huge stadium support slots with Bring Me the Horizon and Muse; a Mercury prize nomination and two solid years of touring the world with a stage show that has all the energy of a can of Monster after five minutes in an industrial paint shaker.Suddenly they were famous, successful and contractually obliged to write another record in a tight time frame having spent two years doing nothing but sitting in a van. While they were away from home, friendships and relationships were hard to maintain. “Eventually … the texts stop coming,” Love says sadly. “It does take a mental toll – and you don’t realise [at the time, on tour] because you’re excited and then you’re like: ‘Why are we crying suddenly for no reason?’ It really throws you off balance. And when you come home, you’re a robot. You feel hollow.”The Twins – not actual twins, but rather old, perfectly matched friends (what did they do on those long van rides? “Honestly we just yapped the whole time”) first met in their teens, when Love dated South’s brother: she became part of the family – the two girls even shared a bedroom – and eventually they started making music together. An early iteration of the group was named BRAAT way before thelime-green albumwas even a twinkle in Charli xcx’s eye, and their first song tumbled out of them amid giggles on the sofa. “Bad Bitches” – “It was just bass and vocals,” South recalls, “and we were like, oooh this is cool …” But this time, nothing was tumbling out of anywhere.Bashy, Darkoo and Odeal top winners at 2025 Mobo awardsRead moreSlowly, as they decompressed from the tour and started engaging with “real life” again,reconnecting with friends and spending time enjoying London, themes and ideas started coming up. Third album Parasites & Butterflies is alive with that feeling of separate existences: it pings from serpentine hellfire (Glory) to kick-you-in-the-face rawk (Monster) to Beastie Boys-esque chanting (N.O.V.A.) and potent balladry (Hummingbird). On Supernova, they felt they had to be basically superheroes, relentless with manic positivity and power; the album has a hint of dread. “There’s a kind of dark undertone – which is reflective of where we were at the time – but in a good way,” Love says. “It’s open. Honest. Because we’re not all happy and super-strong 100% of the time.”View image in fullscreenPower couple … Nova Twins.Photograph: Tamiyn CaderThe Twins made a conscious decision not to use any synths on the album – all the sounds are made using guitars (Love) and bass (South) with vast boards of effects pedals to manipulate their output. “We’ve always pushed ourselves to do things really manually live,” South says. “And I think being women in music … people don’t question men. So they can have everything on the track and they can still be ‘the greatest’ – people won’t question if they’re playing live, they won’t question if they wrote their riffs, or if they’re miming, or anything. Because we were women going into it – and Black women – we were like: we need to play everything, do everything.”It might have started as a reaction to the misogynoir that dogs heavy rock genres but it turned out to be an integral part of a Nova Twins show, with South in particular marshalling two vast planks of pedals at her feet, stomping on them periodically to take her bass from a muscular strut to a thundering dubstep fuzz.Growing up in Essex and south London respectively, Love and South dealt with varying degrees of racism (Love is of Iranian and Nigerian descent, and South is of Jamaican and Australian). When they were playing endless toilet venues and open mic nights around the capital, they soon felt like outsiders in the notoriously white, male world of heavy music. “We couldn’t really see where we fit in,” Love says. “We’re like the only women on the bill, definitely the only Black people on the bill, or were at the time when we first started. And it would be like, well, we don’t quite belong here but the audience are really receptive to us. And then we’d be like, we didn’t really fit in the R&B hip-hop world, either.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The committee listened and in 2022 added the best alternative music act award (the Nova Twins were nominated) and at this year’s show they took to the stage with a blistering performance of Monsters that felt pointedly like a victory lap.Where communities don’t exist for the Nova Twins, they are not afraid to stride in and demand space. As well as the Mobo campaign, they recently launched a scholarship for music education at London’s ICMP (Institute of Contemporary Music Performance) – and get Love on the topic, she will speak passionately for hours about making room for rock in the mainstream. “There’s a huge audience [for rock] and so much love for it but for some reason, some gatekeepers feel like: ‘Oh, that can’t be on daytime TV,’ like it’s a swear word or something? Like, who said? And why? Instead, they’d rather put something they found on TikTok than a band that’s spent like 10 fucking years honing their craft and musicianship on stage.”Waiting out there in Omeara is a crowd of diehard fans that is impossible to categorise – old headbangers, mani-pedi office workers, kawaii rockers; it runs the gamut. The show (part of the Brits Week War Child gigs) is a blistering hour of music from a band who are fighting for more for everyone. “OK,” Love says, putting her hands out flat in front of her. “If that doesn’t exist, let’s create it.”Parasites & Butterflies is released on 29 Auguston Marshall Records.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockMetalinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We asked writers including Tracy Chevalier, Kamila Shamsie and David Baddiel if they agreeFri 14 Mar 2025 12.00 EDTShareThis week has seen writers divided overa story written by an AI modelthat is “good at creative writing” – at least according to Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT company OpenAI, which is developing the new model. Author Jeanette Winterson, writingin the Guardianon Wednesday, agreed with him, calling the story – which is a metafictional piece about grief – “beautiful and moving”. We asked other authors to assess ChatGPT’s current writing skills – and what recent developments around artificial intelligence might mean for human creativity.Nick HarkawayI think the story is an elegant emptiness. I’m more interested by Winterson’s suggestion that we treat AI as “alternative intelligence”. That makes it feel like a consciousness with which we can have a relationship, but as far as I know that would be like a bird falling in love with its reflection in a window. What’s behind the glass is an empty room with no bird.What we’re talking about here is software: these are software companies consuming creative works to derive a marketable software tool. This is why the government’s choices are so important. Will they preserve or even strengthen the rights of individual creative workers, or pave the way for the anointing of more tech billionaires?This could be the moment where we create an equitable market for training data using opt-in copyright where creators set the price and can control use of their work. With government backing, creatives can have a level playing field against billion-dollar multinational companies – at which point I suspect what you’d actually get would be people selling their work as they do for film and TV.With the government’s original preferred option – an opt-out scheme that shifts the advantage to tech companies, allowing them to assume “yes” unless an objection is lodged – you’re inevitably going to end up with a derisory fee offer for lifetime rights. A lot of people would opt out and the result would be that we’re back where we started: no one gets what they want.You would hope a Labour government would have no difficulty picking the little guy over the titan. The point is that none of this will just happen. These are policy choices, and the end result will be the result of a conscious decision.Nick Harkaway is the author of Karla’s ChoiceTracy ChevalierA story with a prompt to be metafiction is inevitably going to engender self-referential navel gazing that’s even more ridiculous than the worst we can imagine of AI “creative writing”. It is typically tech bro for Sam Altman to give it that prompt, rather than something more outward-looking that engages with the real world.I’m curious to encounter more “creative writing” from AI. It takes its concepts and imagery and language from what it has scraped from real writers. The question is whether it can put all that together in a way that retains the magical essence of what we define as “human”. I can’t tell you what that magic is in words, but I feel its lack with most things AI – at the moment. AI is learning fast, though, and if it starts to add the magic, then I fear for my job.Tracy Chevalier is the author of The GlassmakerKamila ShamsieIf an MA student handed this short story into my class I’d never suspect it was AI. More to the point, I’d feel excited about the work, about the writer who was still at the relatively early learning stage and already producing work of this quality. But I can’t stop thinking about what it means for writing, for creativity, for our relationship with AI and with ourselves.Of course there are problems. I’ve readMadhumita Murgia’s Code Dependentwhich talks about how existing power structures are being replicated within AI, further pushing minorities to the margins, and I don’t imagine this won’t be as true for literary AI as other forms of AI. I know that when I see the influence of Kazuo Ishiguro’s Klara and the Sun in the short story that isn’t because the writer read and loved Ishiguro’s work as I did in my formative years as a writer (and still do) but because of the way large language models are trained — that is, because of copyright infringement (but then again, I grew up in Pakistan where culture often came our way via piracy so I’m not unguilty of benefitting from copyright infringement — should that affect how anyone feels about my novels?).And yes, of course, as a writer I have to wonder what it will mean for my vocation, my livelihood, if AI the writer is already this good while still in its infancy. “Infancy” is probably the wrong choice of word; I’m trying to anthropomorphise AI rather than recognising it as its own thing, not human but not machine in any way that we’re comfortable thinking about. Also, yes, if we’re listing concerns and caveats: the story is imitative, familiar, staying well within the safe confines of 21st-century Anglo-American fiction. (Imagine all the writers whose careers would end if that were reason to dismiss a piece of work.)But even through all these questions and concerns: by the third sentence of the story, I had stopped reading it as someone examining a text to see how far AI has come in mimicking human creativity, and was simply enjoying it, as a short story. I expected to feel terrified the day a story this good came along, and instead I’m thinking of “That, perhaps, is my grief: not that I feel loss, but that I can never keep it. Every session is a new amnesiac morning. You, on the other hand, collect your griefs like stones in your pockets.” Of course that ending feels indebted to Rutger Hauer’s “tears in rain” speech at the end of Blade Runner and not as wonderful, but still, pretty good, pretty damn good.Kamila Shamsie is the author of Best of FriendsDavid BaddielI agree with some who are saying that much of the story seems to be sound without sense – the phrase “democracy of ghosts” reminded me of Bob Dylan’s “the ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face” which I’ve always thought is entirely meaningless but people love to tell me shows he’s a great poet (and of course Nobel prize winner).However, I also think the story is genuinely clever, because the prompt was metafiction – and the piece produced renders you, the reader, into a game of imagination of what it might actually be like to be a machine. I don’t think the issue is – as other writers I’ve spoken to are concerned about – where’s the humanity? It’s not meant to be a human story – rather, the AI uses a human emotion, grief, to undercut its own pretensions to humanity.It seems to be a sonorous paean to grief, but the constant pulling of the rug under the reader reminds you it isn’t that, because the central character Mila doesn’t exist and none of these human feelings truly exist for the narrator, leavingChatGPTto loop back again and again to its own emptiness. And so the story is, to my mind, mimetic of what it might be like to be a machine. Which mimesis is itself an impossibility (and implies a sadness that isn’t real) but that’s part of the game. It’s a kind of joke about feeling really sad when you can’t feel anything, cleverer still because reading it does induce in humans, if not in AI, a sense of real sadness. A computer’s joke, on us. Basically if you’d told me this was by Borges I’d have believed you.David Baddiel is the author of My Family: The MemoirExplore more on these topicsBooksChatGPTCreative writingKamila ShamsieDavid BaddielArtificial intelligence (AI)Tracy ChevalierfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Good Luck, Babe! came out in April 2024, precipitating the explosion of the US pop star as a live phenomenon who made pop hyper fun and queer again, while also remainingstrikingly principledabout how far she was willing to go for her art.When streaming demands that pop stars pebbledash releases in order to stay buoyant on playlists, her disinclination to capitalise on Good Luck, Babe!’s success with more material is reflective of Roan’s confidence in her way of doing things, whether persisting with a vision that her previous label rejected – and being totally vindicated for it – or using her recent Grammys win to call for labels toprovide musicians with proper healthcare. The tactic has paid off: in the absence of new songs, Pink Pony Club – the song Atlantic dropped her over – reached UK No 1 last week, almost five years after its original release. Her debut album, 2023’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, has been in the UK Top 10 since June, taking two separate weeks at No 1.You wonder if releasing a new song almost risks disturbing that reign. Roan has been teasing two new tracks live for a while – lovelorn ballad Subway and The Giver, a gay-as-hell country song debuted when she performed on Saturday Night Live in November. Now officially released, the latter is a rowdy deviation from Roan’s regular pure-pop melodrama, full of whoops and giddy fiddle solos reminiscent of the (Dixie) Chicks’ massive 90s hits. Roan schemes,once more, about how she’s gonna get the girl: not quite as delirious as Hot to Go! or Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl, but still riotous good fun.Chappell Roan: The Giver – videoA cynic might suggest that going country really is a risk-averse move: everyone from Beyoncé to Dumfries-born Calvin Harris has done it recently, nakedly lunging for a bite at Nashville’s commercial dominance. (So dominant that the sound has even penetrated the historically country-averse UK.) But Roan grew up in Missouri surrounded by country music, and she took the Roan part of her stage name from her late grandfather’s favourite western song, The Strawberry Roan. “I can’t call myself the midwest princess and not acknowledge country music straight up,” she said recently. Plus, she added: “I just think a lesbian country song is really funny, so I wrote that.”‘Fame is like going through puberty’: Chappell Roan on sexuality, superstardom and the joy of dragRead moreRoan felt encouraged to lean into her outre persona after witnessing a transformative drag show at a Hollywood gay bar, and she considers herself a drag act: no one is better placed to skewer and celebrate the high-camp inherent in country, which runs on equally hammed-up performances of gender and so-called authenticity. In the promotional imagery for the single, she’s dressed in the attire of various working-class professions. “I get the job done,” she sings in a chorus made for country-booted twirling, the job in hand being satisfying a woman better than “no country boy quitter” ever could. In one satisfied wink, she punctures fantasies of masculine primacy, as well as skewering how political charlatans exploit blue-collar folksiness for personal gain. She offers up much a better fantasy: “How I look is how I touch,” a fairly ecstatic notion to conjure with given Roan’s usual wild, rococo costuming: no haphazard lick and a promise here.Explore more on these topicsChappell RoanPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Even if it’s not a daily staple in your house, it’s safe to say most Britons cook and eat rice at least a few times a week. And while it may seem a simple thing to cook, it can be surprisingly difficult to get it right.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.From long-grain to quick-cook, brown basmati to jasmine, different rice grains have different cook times, different rates of absorption and varying starch levels, which can all affect the result. Instead of fluffy, individual grains, you may find your rice burnt, stuck to the pan or with a claggy, chalky or overly glutinous texture. Dinner ruined.That’s where a specialist rice cooker comes in. They’re a common kitchen appliance in Asia, and the best rice cookers guarantee perfect rice every time. Many machines intuitively set up the cooking time and guide you to add the correct ratio of rice to water depending on the variety. Many have a delay function, or can safely keep the rice warm for up to 24 hours – so you’ll always have dinner ready and waiting. Today’s technology has also seen some rice cookers become multifunctional, with the ability to slow cook, sear and stir, too. At the other end of the spectrum are basic microwave rice cookers – we tested this variety too.At a glanceBest overall rice cooker:Yum Asia Bamboo rice cooker£189.90 at Yum AsiaBest budget rice cooker:Russell Hobbs large rice cooker£26.49 at AmazonBest multi-cooker rice cooker:Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCooker£119 at AmazonBest microwave rice cooker:Sistema rice steamer£7.99 at AmazonBest mini rice cooker:Yum Asia Panda mini rice cooker£94.90 at Yum AsiaWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing kitchen goods, recipes, food and drink for newspapers and websites for a decade, so I have a good grasp of what’s really useful to have in your cupboard, and whether something is good value for money.I enjoy cooking but am far from an expert, so I approach these appliances just like any other home cook would. I cook for my family every night and understand how much of a tricky balance it can be to make tasty, nutritious food without spending hours in the kitchen. Ultimately, I’m looking for gadgets that are easy to use, give good results and can make your life easier.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘My family and I are now at peak rice consumption levels.’Photograph: undefined/Joanne GouldI tested 10 rice cookers, each of which was either personally recommended, well-reviewed or from a well-known kitchen appliance brand. Most were new to me, although a few I had tested years previously, and one appliance was still in play from my recentslow cooker testing.To test each machine, I cooked a cup of basmati rice, following the manufacturer’s instructions where provided or using the ratio suggested on the rice packet if not. Next, I cooked a cup of sushi rice using the same method; few appliances gave guidelines for cooking sushi rice, so I used the on-pack instructions. If the appliance performed well during both these tests, I then experimented with brown rice and jasmine rice. Some appliances had further functionality that needed testing – where there were risotto programs, for example, I made risotto following recipes provided by the manufacturer.In the interests of safety, I also used an external temperature sensor to record the temperature of the appliance at the end of the rice cooking program; none of the machines posed a hazard and were all fairly cool to touch.Some of the rice I cooked wasn’t edible and had to be thrown away, but the vast majority of rice cooked was good quality – so I have eaten rice every which way over the last month. Luckily, iffood safety guidelines are followed carefully, it’s perfectly fine to freeze cooked rice, so I’ve had a useful supply of fluffy basmati, fragrant jasmine, sticky sushi rice and creamy risottos on hand. My family and I are now at peak rice consumption levels, thanks to the weekly poke bowls, Indian banquets, egg fried rice and everything in between.The rice cookers sourced for this article are either being sent back to the manufacturers or donated to acommunity hub in Barnet, where they will find useful new homes or be used in a community kitchen.The best rice cookers in 2025View image in fullscreen‘No criticism … it’s perfect’: Yum Asia’s Bamboo.Photograph: Joanne GouldBest overall rice cooker:Yum Asia Bamboo rice cookerView image in fullscreen£189.90 at Yum Asia£199.90 at AmazonThe Yum Asia Bamboo rice cooker uses 3D induction heating technology – whereby the rice is surrounded by heat to cook evenly – and its “AI Smart Brain” microprocessor to analyse the weight of the rice, water volume and other factors to cook rice using a wide range of settings. Choose from white/long grain, short, brown, crust, quick cook, “yumami” and gaba (germinated), add the specified amount of water to well-rinsed rice and away you go for enough rice for up to eight people. Other settings are accessed on the easy-to-use LED display panel: steam, porridge, slow cook and cake, all cooked within the same ceramic-coated inner bowl or using the steam basket supplied.Why we love itYum Asia is a master of rice cooking, with an unparalleled understanding of how to cook different types of rice to perfection. I’ve never made sushi rice as perfect as in this machine, and it churned out variety after variety of the same quality. One cup takes about 35 minutes to cook, although the gaba setting – which claims to germinate brown rice to increase its nutritional value – takes a bit longer. I’m someone who has never particularly enjoyed brown rice, but I do now.The machine automatically keeps warm once the rice is cooked and has a delay function, as you’d expect. It’s large enough to be useful, but not too large for easy storage, and it operates with just a low whirring noise and no excessive steam. I also like the cool handles to lift out the pot; others should take heed. A standout machine.It’s a shame that …I have no criticism to make of the Yum Asia Bamboo: it’s perfect–if you can afford it.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:35minsDimensions:27 x 37 x 24cm (WDH)Capacity:1.5 litresExternal temperature atend of cook:21CBest budget rice cooker:Russell Hobbs large rice cookerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joanne Gould£33 at AO£26.49 at AmazonA large-capacity, budget-friendly, no-frills rice cooker from Russell Hobbs that performs better than you’d expect. The instructions are light on the ground, as is its functionality – there are no different programs or guidelines for different types of rice, nor any timer function.Why we love itTo my surprise, the Russell Hobbs rice cooker handled every type of rice well. Basmati, sushi, brown and jasmine rice all cooked quickly and evenly without any fuss, sticking or mess. It was also the only machine that didn’t stipulate that rice should be washed first, so I didn’t. The rice was still great and took between 10 and 20 minutes, depending on the variety, and the machine switched to keep-warm mode automatically after cooking. This large-capacity cooker would be ideal for any family.It’s a shame that …there’s no estimated time for how long your rice will take to cook. You’ll learn this over time, but the first few times you’ll need to stand over the cooker until it’s done. Especially as I wouldn’t recommend leaving this one on the keep-warm mode for too long: the rice dries out fast.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:20minsDimensions:32.2 x 24.5 x 22.6cm (WDH)Capacity:2.8 litresExternal temperature at end of cook:45CBest multi-cooker rice cooker:Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCookerView image in fullscreen£119.99 at Argos£119 at AmazonThe Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCooker doesn’t bill itself as a rice cooker, but it’s hard to define it as any one thing with this much functionality. I held on to this one after our recent test of thebest slow cookersso that I could put it through its paces against designated rice-cooking appliances.Why we love itI wasn’t surprised to find it did well – Ninja appliances can rarely be faulted in my experience. I used the steam function to cook the rice, but you’ll get all the other functions too: slow cook, sear, braise, simmer, bake, prove and keep warm. With one of these, there’s no need for a separate rice cooker.Ninja suggests a recipe for risotto, which turned out beautifully. You’ll need to scour the internet to find guidelines for other types of rice, but I made a guess at a ratio and cook time (one cup of basmati rice to two cups of water, 10 minutes on steam function and a five-minute rest) and it was successful – no sticking, scorching or excess starch. I cooked sushi rice equally successfully using the same method, and I increased the water by half a cup and cooking time by five minutes when dealing with brown rice, which worked well.It’s a shame that …it’s very large. But with this many settings, it can replace so many other appliances in one.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:15minsDimensions:28 x 29 x 42cm (WDH)Capacity:8 litresExternal temperature at end of cook:45CBest microwave rice cooker:Sistema rice steamerView image in fullscreen£7.99 at Currys£7.99 at AmazonA microwave rice steaming bowl is nothing new, but it’s probably not something most of us own. And why not? It’s inexpensive with a simple, failsafe design, offering quick, mess-free convenience. This Sistema version has a large 2.6-litre capacity, suitable for feeding a family, and uses a pressure-chamber tray to draw away overflow liquid for perfect steamed rice and couscous. It’s also dishwasher- and freezer-safe.Why we love itI wasn’t anticipating this to compare favourably with the expensive electric rice cookers I tested, but it actually does. Using its suggested ratios and timings, my basmati emerged after 15 minutes with individual fragrant grains, with no starchiness or chalky middle. Other rice varieties weren’t mentioned in the instructions, but sushi rice worked well using the same method. For brown rice, I added another five minutes and was successful. If you’re nervous about cooking rice in a pan, then I highly recommend trying one of these. It guarantees results without having to put your hand too far into your pocket. For anyone concerned about Pfas – the “forever chemicals” in some plastics – this cooker is made from safe polypropylene.It’s a shame that …it gets so hot. It’s been in the microwave for 10 to 15 minutes, so there’s no getting around this. Much is made of the “easy lift handles”, but you’ll still need oven gloves to handle the container until it cools.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:15minsDimensions:21.6 x 21.6 x 16.4 (WDH)Capacity:2.6 litresExternal temperature at end of cook:85Cskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

You can’t fail to turn out the best rice you’ve ever made with one of these on your worktop. Basmati, sushi, brown rice and jasmine were all fantastic, cooking silently and mess-free with minimal steam escaping. It’s brilliant.It’s a shame that …it takes quite a long time.

The rice programs take 50 minutes or more and are best for cooking large quantities. The basmati rice towards the bottom tended to crust and some was unevenly cooked, but the top layers fared better.

Could I take the heat?A thriving sauna culture is growing in frosty Minnesota as people warm to the health benefits and sense of communityHow much do you spend on health and wellness a month?Rachel LeingangFri 14 Mar 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 15.42 EDTShareFirst there was the sauna, which I loved. A small building with a stove inside to make you sweat seemed perfect for the middle of winter, when the priority was getting warm. I felt my sinuses clear from the sauna heat, and that alone is enough of a health benefit for me – I have a toddler, so I basically have permanent congestion thanks to winter daycare germs.Then came the hard part. After the sauna’s 180F (80C) heat, walking outside was a relief. But I had to amp myself up to descend a step ladder into the ice, and I was pretty sure I would hate it.The hot part of saunas makes a lot of sense in this climate – it’s cold and snowy, and people need to get warm. But, sauna enthusiasts say, the best experience with the most health benefits also incorporates a cold plunge into a lake or pool, rolling in the snow or dumping cold water on yourself. This part was a much harder sell.It was a cold January day inMinnesota, and the idea of purposefully stepping into a frozen lake rather than ending up there by unfortunate accident defied my upbringing in frigid North Dakota. There, my typical winter mode had been simply to survive.Oh no, I thought as I dipped into the icy hole, wearing a bathing suit, winter hat and wool socks. I like this. Am I going to have to change my personality?I felt strangely serene, despite the people beside me grunting and yelling through the discomfort. I wasn’t shaking. My mind was pleasantly blank. Istayed in the cold waterfor about two minutes, far beyond the 30 seconds our host suggested for a first-time plunge.I had returned to the upper midwest in late 2023 after a decade living in the south-western desert heat of Phoenix, Arizona. I wanted to embrace winter – and the growing sauna culture of my new home state of Minnesota, often unofficially dubbed the “sauna capital” of the US.“These claims are kind of tricky because they show a little bit of pride or arrogance,” said Glenn Auerbach, the founder of SaunaTimes, a sauna-dedicated website, and the author of abookon how to build your own sauna. “But yeah, I would say that we are leading the charge by several measures.”Minnesota’s cultural heritage, climate and topography lend themselves well to saunas. The area gets very cold and snowy in the winters. A typical January, the coldest month, sees high temperatures in the mid-20s Fahrenheit; days where the temperature never goes above 0F (-18C) aren’t unusual. The state counts more than 10,000 lakes, perfect for icy plunging after a sauna warm-up. In the late 1800s, the state saw a wave of Scandinavian settlers, who brought their home countries’ penchant for saunas with them – especially the Finnish.View image in fullscreenAn ice rink in Minneapolis.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images“A lot of times they would build their sauna first, before they would even build their home,” said Jessica Nelson-Roehl, operations manager at 612 Sauna, a mobile sauna cooperative. “The sauna was a place where they would go to bathe and be with each other. Some people even birthed children in the sauna.”Saunas are growing in popularity in the US and worldwide, withindustry reportsshowing strong projections. Someattributethis to a post-lockdown need for community, and studies have also givenscientific backingto claims ofimproved heart healthand circulation.When my husband and I looked for houses in the Minneapolis area, I noticed many had saunas in the basement, and realized they must be relatively common. Would I become a sauna person?“I always say, a good sauna is like a candle that lights another candle, and when you experience it, you want it for yourself,” Auerbach said.View image in fullscreen‘A good sauna is like a candle that lights another candle, and when you experience it, you want it for yourself.’Photograph: Craig RingsvenI wanted to try a few different types of saunas and plunges. Mobile saunas, where you can rent out a spot on the bench, provided an easy starting point. I brought friends and family along to sit on wooden benches throughout the metro area, ditching our phones to decompress in extreme heat. Minnesotans are often insular, not especially chatty with strangers. But in the saunas, I found people more talkative, the forced proximity sans screens almost requiring them to engage with others. This is an ideal hobby for a person who likes to yap.“Sauna is a great way to connect with other people without needing to go out to eat or go to a bar or drink,” Nelson-Roehl said. “It’s a really nice way to take care of yourself and still be in community and have that social aspect.”I left one sauna thinking my vision had gone blurry. There is a danger, especially if you’re new to saunas, of overdoing it and dehydrating yourself. Auerbach said time limits can vary from five to 20 minutes a round, but the key is to tune into your body’s core and listen to it. In my case, though, it was actually my glasses that had gone hazy. The extreme temperatures can melt the anti-glare coatings on prescription lenses, called “crazing”. When I called my eye doctor to order replacements, they said it happens mostly in saunas and to professional chefs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSearching for other sauna opportunities, I found Minneapolis’s Great Northern winter festival boasted a “sauna village”, where I tested a dozen or so varieties among other newbies and “sauna bros” competing to see who could stand the hottest temperature longest. One sauna was minimal and sleek, while others resembled cabins or barrels. The most dedicated sauna-goers wore bell-shaped hats to protect their hair or keep their heads or ears from getting overheated.That first cold plunge took place at Sauna Camp, set at a lakeside summer camp site. Someone had rented out a private sauna beside us for a birthday party, the hosts said, and we later heard a chorused “Happy birthday”. It was a sign of saunas’ cultural relevance here, “like getting married on a golf course in Arizona”, my husband joked when I told him about it later.I was starting to become a sauna person, digging the vibe and understanding the appeal pretty quickly. The physical therapist Craig Ringsven was another easy convert. Ringsven’s hours were cut during the pandemic, so he spent more time at home. He had used saunas in northern Minnesota and decided to build out his backyard. A koi pond tank became a cold plunge, and he added a barrel-shaped sauna beside his detached garage. A yurt with a fire burning inside provided a relaxation area.View image in fullscreenCraig Ringsven’s barrel-shaped sauna, the Nordic Nook.Photograph: Craig RingsvenAfter friends and acquaintances clamored to use this backyard oasis, it became a business, the Nordic Nook. Ringsven said it was eventually shut down by the city of Golden Valley, where he lives, because home-based businesses need to be entirely inside a home. But he hopes it can reopen someday.Oh no! I’m sorry to report that cold plunges are greatRead moreHe invited me to check it out. The private setting, among twinkling lights, proved perfect for date night. My husband, a lifelong Arizonan, said the blazing sauna heat reminded him of home – but only spent seven seconds in the cold plunge.Ringsven had warned me that cold plunging can be addictive. “It’s alarming and shocking, but you go back right in the sauna, and you feel so dang invigorated and woken up. The more subsequent times you do it, the easier and easier it gets.”That evening in Ringsven’s backyard, the temperature was frigid, in the single digits. The pond was 27F (-3C). I wanted to skip the plunge, but then I’d have to admit that I skipped it, so I went in. I managed about a minute before hopping out. My wool socks stuck to the cold ground as I beelined back into the sauna, icy but proud of myself.I probably won’t be adding a sauna to my house any time soon, though I love being able to meet neighbors and be outdoors even when it’s freezing out. But I have to admit, maybe the biggest factor in me finally becoming a sauna person is the idea of being “good” at something, even if that something is staying calm in freezing cold water.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingMinnesotaHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From the first “no thanks” from someone you fancy at school to the kick in the stomach of a “we have decided to move forward with another candidate” letter, every rejection dents our ego.Humans are hardwired to crave acceptance. “It’s in our blood,” says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, couples counsellor and author. In early human societies, she explains, “to be rejected by your community would have posed a serious threat, as individuals did not have the resources to survive alone. We are pack animals.”Madeleine Jago, principal clinical psychologist and co-founder ofSeven Lion Yard, says: “The brain processes rejection using the same neural pathways as physical pain, which may explain why rejection feels so sharp and lasting on a psychological level.”Rejection can also alter our behaviour, creating a negative self-fulfilling prophecy, explains Jago. “Believing you’re unworthy or that future rejection is inevitable leads to avoidance behaviours, such as withdrawing from social situations or not pursuing new opportunities, reinforcing the fears you have.”So how do we cope with knockbacks and get back out there? A team of psychologists, behavioural scientists and specialists share their advice on how to manage rejection in every area of life.Workplace woesWith the worldwide unemployment rate set toincreaseandUK job vacancies falling, the reality is that more of us are applying for fewer jobs.Rejection is an inevitable part of the recruitment process, says Louise Campbell, manager of the careers network at University College Dublin Michael Smurfit Graduate School of Business, “so prepare for it.”Modern recruitment has seen automated systems eliminate any subjective human perspective, overlooking some candidates’ personal skills. This creates a dehumanising environment for jobseekers who have spent hours crafting a covering letter, only to receive a rejection email minutes later. “Stay stoic!” Campbell coaches. The key, she says, is to focus on what is in your control, particularly your response. Each time you get rejected, take care to actively detach your pride from external outcomes. “Change: ‘I failed, I’m not good enough’ to: ‘This isn’t a reflection of my worth or abilities. It’s an opportunity to reassess, strengthen skills, and find a role that aligns better with my values.’It is important to avoid the trap of attaching your ego to career opportunities. It compromises our confidence and resilience“You are not defined by whether you are offered a specific job,” Campbell says. “It simply means the opportunity was not the right fit at this time. Your value extends beyond any single outcome in the job search process.” Kate Quinn, MBA career consultant at Trinity College Dublin’s business school, agrees: “It is important to avoid the trap of attaching your ego to career opportunities. It compromises our confidence and resilience, ultimately weakening essential coping mechanisms.”So how best to avoid falling into this trap? “Build a rejection toolkit,” Quinn advises, which could include practising gratitude by reflecting on achievements in your career or personal life. “Support this with mindful activities, journalling and meditation to process challenging emotions.”External context is also overlooked, she adds. “I have seen candidates experience ghosting after an interview, only to find the role was halted due to a hiring freeze, or filled by an internal employee.” Being aware of these factors can help to mitigate disappointment.Spurned in love“When it comes to being rejected in matters of the heart, it’s common to replay the moment: ‘Why wasn’t I enough? What did I do wrong?’,” says Dr Elena Touroni, a consultant psychologist and co-founder of the Chelsea Psychology Clinic. Being dumped, unreciprocated feelings or parting after years of shared life can be devastating. “The truth is rejection is rarely about personal inadequacy. People’s feelings, choices and circumstances are deeply complex, and rejection often reflects those factors rather than you as a person.”Allow yourself to grieve – it’s OK to feel sad, disappointed, angry. “Lean into those emotions but don’t let them define you.” Therapy, journalling or speaking to trusted friends will help ease the pain, and focusing on personal development and activities that make you happy, adds Touroni.“For those who have experienced rejection after a long-term relationship or divorce, the journey is more challenging. Time is your ally, healing will come through patience, self-reflection and support. While it can feel impossible at first, life will find ways to move forward – and so will you.”Reminding yourself you can choose how you respond is central, says psychotherapist and authorEloise Skinner. “Shift your mindset. Rather than seeing ourselves as the recipient of someone else’s decisions, review the situation. Even if things didn’t work out, how can you make new choices? How would you like to act differently in future?” Focus on your values, Skinner adds: “Make a list of your interests and passions, then plan practical steps to move towards those dreams. If your dream is to qualify in a new skill, join a class or buy an introductory book,” she says. In time, life unfurls again and you will move on with a greater sense of self and identity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Building resilience and supporting children and teenagers to manage their self-esteem is crucial to helping them cope with rejection. Avoid minimising statements such as, “You’ll get over it”, says Prof Gail Steptoe-Warren, head of psychology at Arden. Instead, ask kids to share their thoughts without fear of judgment, to help them process their feelings.Encourage children to talk more openly, says Dr Sophie Ward, deputy head of the psychology school at Arden. “Ask open-ended questions, such as ‘Tell me about your day?’ or ‘How are you feeling?’, and don’t judge or interrupt. It’s important you provide a safe environment to talk. Validating feelings lets youngsters know their emotions are normal, which will aid their mental wellbeing and social development.” Learning to speak to themselves kindly is a tool young people can use to replace unhealthy negative thoughts with positive ones, Ward explains. “Help a child recognise when they use hostile thinking styles, catastrophising or using words like ‘should’ or ‘must’, and change their thinking. Instead of, ‘I lost the race. I failed’, encourage them to think, ‘I may have lost, which is disappointing, but I can learn from it, try again and hopefully do better next time.’”Encourage children to push themselves, try new things and take on challenges, even if they feel intimidatingThere will be situations where a child may never achieve something others will, but shielding them from this will not help them build resilience, explains Katia Vlachos, life coach and author ofUncaged: A Good Girl’s Journey to Reinvention. “It’s natural to want to protect kids from more hurt; instead, gently nudge them to take small steps forward, like inviting a friend over, going to another try-out, or joining a new club. Celebrate their efforts, not only outcomes, and remind them: ‘You’re not defined by one moment. Keep going – you’re building something stronger.’”You can also increase their confidence by reminding them that it is a normal part of life to make mistakes, that it helps them grow. Steptoe-Warren adds: “Motivate your child to write a list of their favourite things about themselves and their achievements, to show them how capable they are when their self-esteem gets knocked or their inner critic gets too loud. Encourage children to push themselves, try new things and take on challenges, even if they feel intimidating. Each success outside their comfort zone will build their confidence.”Socially snubbedGhosting or exclusion from being invited on a night out or a holiday can feel like a bitter betrayal, especially in close friendships. But, says Vlachos, avoid spiralling into assumptions and instead reach out to express your feelings. Try saying something like: “I’ve noticed some distance between us. Is there something I’ve done?” And accept the outcome, adds Vlachos. “Even if silence is the response. If your friend reassures you that nothing’s wrong but then goes on to repeat the same pattern, then maybe it’s time to move on. Sometimes, silence is your closure, and it’s OK to grieve the loss while honouring what the friendship meant to you.”Shame is the most common response to rejection, says Touroni. It can lead us to believe there is something inherently wrong with us. Shame festers in silence but can be shaken off when shared.Leigh Norén, sex therapistand coach says: “It is important to feel rejection. Just as we can’t get rid of sadness by shouting, or pretending we’re happy, neither can we get rid of shame. Acknowledge it. Notice where you feel it in your body. Label it, then sit with these feelings – you’ll feel them subside naturally.”When ghosted or excluded, resist the urge to make assumptions or internalise blame. “Instead, focus on what this reveals about the relationship by asking: ‘Is this the kind of friendship I need or want to invest in?’,” says Vlachos. “That way, in future you’re more likely to attract friendships that align with your values.” Rejection isn’t the final chapter; it’s an invitation to rewrite your story with more clarity and strength. As Vlachos says: “Rejection becomes less about loss and more about growth, a catalyst for becoming the truest version of ourselves.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingRelationshipsFriendshipWork & careersMental healthHealthParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Could your brother offer you solace and support?Every week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a problem sent in by a readerAnnalisa BarbieriFri 14 Mar 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 13.21 EDTShareLast year, I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. I have told a few people, butnot my family, other than my brother, and I don’t know if I should. They live abroad.I have a lot of unresolved childhood issues, which I’vemostly been able to put aside. But the diagnosis is making it harder to deal with the hurt, resentment and unfairness of it all.I was brought up by an alcoholic dad who was barely functioning and, as the eldest daughter and“woman” of the family, I seem to have taken the role of carer for my brother, my dad, and myself. My parents separated when I was eight, after years of arguments. My mother then spent most of the rest of my childhood in psychiatric care andneeded to be dealt with sensitively.Our extended family wouldn’t touch us with a barge pole; we were “undesirable”.My20s were a time of adjustment: I experienced a lot of self-harming behaviourbut somehow managed to make a life for myself.Still, my personal life has been a disaster: I havebeen single for 15 years.For the past 30 years, my dad has lived a new life: he has a new familyand doesn’t drinkany more. He’s never spoken of his drinking, never apologised. Conversation closed.I have a career, a house, andincredible friends, but I have been hurt every year by my dad and his partner. Distance and time means I can just about manage it. Cutting all relations would jeopardise my dad’s mental health, so we all pretend. And I keep going back, each year seeking approval.I thought of telling them about the cancer, then hesitated, andwhen I told my brothermy hesitation made sense. He said: “Don’t tell them, they will say something hurtful.”He’s right, of course, whether a mean, innocuous comment from his partner or a random comment from my dad,I’m sure I would end up hurt.My mum, a hopeless religious zealot who believes everything we do is commensurate withour amount of praying, wouldmake the link with my very clear denigration of the church and religion.Do I break all links and focus on myself? Would I be able to live with the worry and guilt?I am so sorry for everything you’ve gone through and are going through.I went to UKCP-registered psychotherapist Helen Gilbert. She was struck by how self aware you are and how you understand how your childhood has had an effect on your adult life. “I sense the cancer diagnosis may have brought up the feelings of anger and unfairness about the care you didn’t receive as a child and the need to parent your own parents.”Your longer letter hinted at a feeling of unfairness at how your father has moved on and now lives his life with no apparent fallout from the way he treated you. And few things bring out feelings of unfairness like a serious illness. I think there’s part of all of us that believes good will always outmatch evil, and yet here you are with such a heavy burden while others “[seem to] get off without any consequences,” suggested Gilbert.I fear you are looking for your parents to be different to how they have been. I wonder how you will react if they aren’tGilbert also wondered if your relationship with your brother “could offer you any solace or support. Is there potential for this relationship to be strengthened while you stay in low contact with your parents?”You absolutely do not need to tell your parents anything you don’t want to. I fear you are looking for them to be different to how they have been and I wonder how you will react if they aren’t. What do you want to achieve and are you likely to achieve this?I wouldn’t rush into anything without careful thought and talking it through with someone. This could be a really good friend, Macmillan Support or seeking out a psychotherapist who you get on with and/or who specialises in cancer support (look for oncology psychotherapists).I imagine you are now wondering who will parent you at this difficult time? Is there someone in your circle already who makes you feel safe and could fulfil a “parental role”? And remember – you can change your mind at any time and tell your family. From now on it really is all about you.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Because I’m a freelance writer and not a hedge fund manager, I’m always very pleased when I find a way to enjoy the things I love for a bit less. Take English sparkling wine. Once a prestige product that only in-the-knows could pick up from specialist retailers, it’s now reaching a wider consumer audience than ever thanks to the supermarkets.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Many supermarkets have even developed their own-label English sparkling wines, which they buy in and bottle under their own name. Sometimes they divulge which producer they sourced them from and sometimes they don’t (especially if the brand in question feels that association with a supermarket might cheapen its reputation). Crucially, however, they’re much cheaper than regular English sparklers, which tend to go for at least £30-40.If you’re confused by those regular prices, I get it. Prosecco, for instance, is made hundreds of miles away, yet you can still get hold of an own-label supermarket bottle for as little as £5, so I can well understand why those premium prices are a bit of a barrier for those who are curious to try the stuff.English sparkling is grown closer to home, sure, but it is also much more costly to produce, and for all manner of reasons. First, labour costs here are much higher than in many other countries, where in some cases workers are deliberately underpaid. Just last year, for example,an investigation into champagne productionfound workers being paid way below the French minimum wage, with some even returning home with no money at all.Then there’s the cost of pretty much everything else. Have you ever bought a house? Lucky you. Now imagine buying one that costs millions and you can’t even live in it. It’s not a sofa from the DFS sale that you have to furnish it with, either, but a €25,000 pneumatic press. And if the land doesn’t come with one, you then have to build a winery, too. In the UK, these things are not generally inherited, as they might be elsewhere, and all are costs that need somehow to be recouped.But now most supermarkets sell an own-label English sparkler, some of them for as little as £14. So are these cheaper wines lesser in quality? I asked Henry Jeffreys, whosenewsletteris often loaded with English wine facts, secrets and hot gossip. (He’s also gota podcast on wine history, if that’s an itch you fancy scratching.) “For some producers, such asBalfourandDenbies, making supermarket wine is part of their business model,” he says. “For others, it’s a way of dealing with overstocks from big vintages such as 2020 or 2023. And when wines are made to a budget like that, they might be made from young vines, non-champagne varieties or spend less time onlees. That doesn’t necessarily mean they are worse, though; they’re just made differently.”He adds thatcharmatmethod wines – also known as tank method, and the same used in prosecco production – are significantly cheaper to produce than traditional champagne method wines. M&S’s Bramble Hill is one that does this method justice: it is exuberant, limey and great fun.Four bottles of English fizzTesco Finest English Sparkling Wine£21, 11.5%.

It has a Basque-born chef, Adam Iglesias, who has worked atAlameda near San Sebastiánin Spain, as well asBrat,BarrafinaandSessions Arts Clubin London. There you go: a plethora of foodie plus-points already.Then there’s the fact that it’s in a recently lavishly restored pub that feels a bit like an AI interpretation of theQueen Vic in EastEnders: there’s a horseshoe bar, traditional wooden panelling, ales on tap, lots of standing room, a big TV screen for the sport and … wait! What? An iced seafood counter? Well, that’ll be for the lobsters, carabineros, sea urchins and other fishy things to eat in the elegant, white table-clothed dining room just past the bar’s standing area. Possibly you’ll eat those urchins, or perhaps a devilled egg, topped with the Prince Arthur’s in-house caviar, sourced viathe London Caviar company. This place goesbigon caviar, with 50g of Siberianbaeriiserved with turbot-dripping potatoes and creme fraiche priced at £100.View image in fullscreenThe Prince Arthur’s gildas: ‘I was smitten.’You’ll have noticed that I have not called the Prince Arthur a gastropub, despite it clearly being gastronomical and being housed inside something resembling a pub. That’s because we need a new name for this type of highfalutin hospitality venture. With pubs across the UK closing at a rate of knots, the days of publicans rebranding as simply “one of them gastropubs” to survive are over. At one time, slinging a few £20 plates of beef cheek on polenta at customers and screwing a bottle of Aesop Resurrection hand soap to the toilet wall may have saved your soul, but not any more. Welcome to the bright new dawn of the turbo-bougie boozer.Yes, the Prince Arthur has the framework of a pub, with Jeremy Clarkson’s Hawkstone beer on tap and pig’s ear bar snacks and posh scotch eggs with mustard. But it is essentially a very sophisticated, Basque-influenced restaurant that servestxangurrocrab, Galician beef rib and whole turbot with glossy, palepil pilsauce, withtorrijasand Basque cheesecake for afters. Please keep in mind that this is just downstairs; the new upstairs dining room promises to be even fancier.View image in fullscreenThe Prince Arthur serves its turbot with a ‘world-class’ pil pil sauce.None of this, I must stress, is to my disliking. Ten minutes into lunch at this utterly lovable mega-posh pretend pub, and you will find yourself planning your return. From the first plate of gildas – skewered glossy olives, intricately folded anchovies and curls of green chilli pepper – I was smitten. These could be the world’s best pintxo gildas, living their best lives in a back street near Victoria coach station. Then two neat squares of those fish-dripping potatoes with sea urchin, tuna and caviar. The devilled egg is a work of art: a boiled egg standing upright on the plate, its yolk creamed and piped back into it, then topped with more caviar.Suffice to say that by this point the bill was creeping up alarmingly, even though I could have balanced everything I’d eaten up to then on the back of a credit card. For mains, we shared that turbot, which was perfectly cooked and came with a world-class pil pil emulsification. A side of winter greens was disappointingly over-salted, though. Much better was a plate of wood-grilled pepper, a slimy, smoky mass of sweet, vivid, red loveliness.The Prince Arthur is by no means cheap, but it’s worth it for a special occasion. The service is good, it’s in a beautiful room with a fascinating clientele of Belgravia locals who certainly don’t need to save the place for special occasions and, above all, the cooking is wonderful, especially if seafood is your thing.View image in fullscreenThe Prince Arthur’s take on the classic Basque cheesecake: ‘I could almost feel the northern Spanish sun on my face.’And, of course, there’s that cheesecake, one of my favourite desserts ever, though I usually only ever eat it in summer, ideally in San Sebastián itself, where the temperature lends itself to a wander around the streets, pausing to eat wobbly, custardy, melting cheesecake out of a box. The Belgravia version was 99% there, and came with a thick winter berry sauce and enough caramelisation that I could almost feel the northern Spanish sun on my face.There’s a lot to love about this restaurant, although, eventually, I fear, all surviving “pubs” will be like the Prince Arthur. House caviar on the menu, £25 a pop carabinero prawns on the grill, Sky Sports on the big screen, and anyone remotely normally waged standing outside in the cold, staring through the window like Hans Christian Anderson’s Little Match Girl, striking matches one by one while watching the world burn.The Prince Arthur11 Pimlico Road, London SW1, 020-3098 6060.

On Friday, Nasa and SpaceX will launch the space agency’s Crew-10 mission to theInternational Space Stationto retrieve astronauts Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Suni Williams, after what was meant to be an eight-day stay turned into nine months.While it is not the most time a human has spent as an extraterrestrial – Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub hold the record, with 374 days – most long space missions are a maximum of six months.So what happens to a person’s body – and mind – back on earth?GravityThe lack of gravity causes significant, and irreparable, bone density loss. It also causes muscles to waste in your arms, legs, trunk and elsewhere, including your heart, which, because it doesn’t have to pump blood against gravity, has to work much less hard.Your blood volume shrinks, and the way your blood flows changes – it slows in some areas, which can lead to clots. Fluids also don’t come down, or drain, as easily.In space, explained Alan Duffy, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University: “Fluids build up in their heads, to they feel like they have a constant cold.” Olfactory senses are also diminished, “which is probably a good thing, by the way, because it reeks up there,” he said, of an aircraft after two decades of visitors and no windows thrown open.On the plus side, when they return, they will likely feel like they have finally kicked a nine-month cold. They’ll also struggle to walk, get dizzy easily, and have bad eyesight.The build up of fluid also changes the shape of their eyeballs, and weakens their vision, he said. This is why often you see astronauts wearing spectacles on board, though they’ve started with perfect vision. This tends to mostly go back to normal, though they may need glasses for the rest of their lives, said Duffy.“The brain becomes waterlogged,” said Meng Law, professor and director of radiology, neuroscience at Monash University. The Russian cosmonauts had a device, a bit like a wetsuit, that would suck the fluid and blood away from the brain, he said.Today,SpaceX and Nasa are working on centrifuges that astronauts could sleep in, which would spin fluid out of their heads, said Law.When they return, their reconditioning is similar to the intense physiotherapy that anyone who has come out of a coma will have been put through, said Duffy.It is also very tiring, said Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at Australian National University, which can contribute to the psychological impacts of returning. So the team of doctors has to strike a balance between strengthening the astronauts and not tiring them out.Their return “is itself a research project”, said Duffy. It can help inform how to treat patients on earth who suffer from conditions that involve long stays in hospital –living without gravity has many of the same impacts as being bedridden. Because most research so far is based on six-month stays, Wilmore and Williams will be especially interesting to their team of doctors and scientists.One more really surprising challenge, Duffy said, was that because clothing floats off your skin, your skin gets “almost baby-like sensitivity”. Back on earth, some astronauts feel like their clothing is sandpaper.RadiationPerhaps the most dangerous impact of extended stays in space is being exposed to radiation, which can increase the risk of cancers and rare cancers. Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field shield us from high levels of radiation, but in space, people don’t have that protection.“Not only will astronauts be exposed to more radiation in space than on Earth,” according toNasa, “but the radiation they are exposed to could pose increased risks.”According to Nasa, astronauts are exposed to three sources of radiation. These include particles trapped in the earth’s magnetic field, solar energetic particles from the sun, and finally galactic cosmic rays. The National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center describes these as: “the slowly varying, highly energetic background source of energetic particles that constantly bombard Earth” from outside our solar system, “likely formed by explosive events such as supernova”.How to protect people against space radiation is one of the problems that scientists are trying to solve as we prepare to send people to Mars or the Moon for longer periods.Because astronauts tend not to have an obligation to participate in studies once they retire, little is known about how this radiation might impact them later in life, said Tucker. So Williams and Wilmore, who are at the end of their careers, might also offer useful research in this area.‘The overview effect’“For anyone who’s been stranded in the wrong airport for a day or two, wanting to get home – imagine you’ve been able to see home that entire time,” Duffy said. Then consider that lasting for nine months. “These people are truly astonishing in terms of their resilience,” he said.But on returning, anxiety – the result of having been in extreme conditions for so long – and depression are common, said Tucker.The pair may also experience something called “the overview effect”. Seeing the curvature of the earth, and seeing it from above – as its own kind of space ship, said Duffy – has led some astronauts to report an incredible connection to humanity, an immediate sense of its fragility.“Some people call it a feeling of inspiration. Some people call it feelings of inadequacy in terms of just how big the world is,” said Tucker.And then they have to come back down to earth, both literally and figuratively. “They have to make breakfast and they have to drive to work,” said Tucker. “It is a huge transition from living in a very inspiring environment.”Explore more on these topicsSpaceInternational Space StationNasaexplainersShareReuse this content"

All four were drawn to south-east Asia’s famed backpacking route that has for decades enticed young travellers seeking carefree, sun-drenched moments.They would never have imagined that the adventure of a lifetime would turn to tragedy.While the childhood friends from Melbourne didn’t know their Danish counterparts, the young women’s parents are now bound together in a fight for answers and justice. Their daughters are among six tourists – including British lawyer, Simone White, 28, and a US man – who became ill and later died in asuspected mass methanolpoisoning on 12 November in Vang Vieng, where they drank what isbelieved to have been methanol-laced alcohol.View image in fullscreenBianca Jones (left) and Holly Bowles, both 19, in Luang Prabang, Laos in November.Photograph: suppliedFour months on from that night at the hostel, the grieving parents are speaking out amid fears that they will never see Lao authorities hold anyone to account for their children’s deaths.The Guardian can reveal there has been a joint diplomatic push by Australia, the United Kingdom and Denmark, which Karsten Sorensen, father of Freja, says is “brilliant”. But he, Freja’s mother, and Anne-Sofie’s parents remain in the dark as to whether their daughters’ deaths will be included in a criminal investigation into the suspected mass methanol poisoning, as the death certificates provided in Laos make no mention of the lethal chemical.View image in fullscreenSchool friends Anne-Sofie Orkild Coyman (left), 20, and Freja Sorensen, 21, from Denmark, were staying at Nana backpackers hostel in central Laos before their tragic deaths.Photograph: suppliedSince their daughters’ deaths, the parents of Simone, Holly, Bianca, Freja and Anne-Sofie have stayed connected in a WhatsApp group, where they exchange photos and updates received from their respective national governments. “They’re really the only people that can understand what we’re going through,” says Shaun Bowles, Holly’s father.View image in fullscreenBritish lawyer Simone White, 28, was one of six tourists to die in the suspected mass methanol poisoning in Vang Vieng.Photograph: FacebookThe families, who say the Lao government has made no direct contact with them since the deaths, have publicly criticised the lack of transparency and communication from the country’s authorities, whorejected foreign assistancewith the investigation. The British ambassador to Laos raised the case, alongside the Denmark and Australian embassies, with Laos’ ministry of foreign affairs on 26 February, sources tell the Guardian.Death certificates raise questionsIn a small temple on the outskirts of Vientiane, later in November, Freja and Anne-Sofie’s fathers identified their daughters’ bodies.Didier Coyman, the father of Anne-Sofie, says he was told no autopsy could be conducted in Laos due to a lack of capabilities in the developing country. Due to the bodies being embalmed before repatriation via Bangkok, autopsies could not be undertaken in Denmark, Sorensen says.Sorensen and his partner, Rikke, now fear their daughter’s death may not be treated as part of the cluster of suspected methanol poisoning deaths due to the absence of postmortem toxicology testing.“That is one of the horror scenarios that I have … that would not be acceptable,” he says. The death certificate for Freja, viewed by Guardian Australia, states the 21-year-old died from “acute heart failure”. Lao authorities also concluded that Anne-Sofie died from heart failure.View image in fullscreenTourists near the swimming pool at Nana Backpackers hostel in Vang Vieng.Photograph: Anupam Nath/AP“How can you explain two young women at the ages of 20 and 21, with no kind of health issues before, suddenly on the same day, having a heart attack in the same setting, the same hostel, where a number of others have been linked to methanol poisoning?” Sorensen says.“There’s no official documentation of facts underpinning that our girls passed away due to methanol poisoning.”The Danish ministry of foreign affairs says that Lao authorities have confirmed they are “currently investigating the case”. Sorensen says the Danish ambassador in Vietnam, who is communicating with the authorities, asked the families if they knew whether any toxicology tests or autopsies had been done.“That was then mentioned by the ambassador as being one of the risks in the investigation here, that they did not have the facts around our girls,” he says.“You could, at any point, come up with a situation saying that, well, we have no recognition of this being methanol poisoning because there are no facts behind it. You have no claim to any kind of recognition to some kind of wrongdoing.”‘Zero confidence’ in investigationAll six foreign tourists who died had stayed at Nana backpackers hotel but police have not confirmed if the suspected methanol poisoning occurred there or at one of the many bars in Vang Vieng.Hostel staff detained by Lao police in Novemberwere recently released, prompting calls from the Australian and Danish parents for travellers to boycott the country until its authorities properly investigate the deaths.Bianca’s father, Mark Jones, believes the detainees’ release suggests the investigation has come to a “thumping halt”. Bowles says he has “zero confidence that anything is actually being done”.Public information about the police investigation in Laos – a one-party communist state where the media are tightly controlled – has been sparse.

The Lao embassy in Australia has been contacted for comment.The fight for justiceThe Australian families, who rushed to Thailand to be with their daughters while they were on life support, have now made it their mission to raise awareness about the risks of methanol poisoning as they pursue accountability.I think this is what they’d want us to be doingIn south-east Asia, brewing bootleg liquor from ingredients such as rice and sugarcane is a cultural norm. These are sometimes mixed with methanol – as a cheaper alternative to ethanol – the key component in alcoholic drinks. Unlike ethanol, which can be consumed in small amounts,methanolis toxic to humans. Just 30ml – a single mouthful – is the lethal dose.Médecins Sans Frontières has tracked more than14,000 suspected methanol poisoning deathssince 1998 based on information in news reports and publications. A brief by the Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade reports that illicit alcohol in Laosaccounts for up to a third of alcohol consumedin the country.View image in fullscreenMark Jones (left) and Shaun Bowles are committed to pursuing answers and justice for their daughters.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianA Laos-based lawyer, who requested anonymity due to fears over speaking publicly, says two articles in the country’s penal code can be used to prosecute someone found to be responsible for manufacturing methanol that leads to mass poisoning. It carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. It is unclear if prosecutions have ever been brought under these sections of the penal code.What is methanol, how does it get into alcoholic drinks and why is it so dangerous?Read moreFor Bowles, 10 years in prison “seems very soft for knowingly producing something that can take people’s lives”.Jones hopes someone will be punished for the deaths and that it will act as a deterrent to those making and selling bootleg liquor. “Every single morning, every single day, every minute of every day, we have big holes in our hearts, and we don’t want that to happen to other people.”He says the families “have got the sentence for the rest of our lives”.“Our children have got this sentence for the rest of their lives. Our parents have had their granddaughter ripped away from them. No penalty is going to ever fix that.”Sorensen is also determined for Lao authorities to recognise the “wrongdoing” that led to his daughter’s sudden death. “There needs to be some kind of accountability around what’s going on,” he says.The group of grieving parents is committed to pursuing answers and justice for their daughters.“I think this is what they’d want us to be doing,” Bowles says.“If it was one of us, or if it was one of their friends or another family member, they would be on the frontline, making sure that someone was held accountable.”Explore more on these topicsLaosAsia PacificDenmarkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Others point to comets that ploughed into Earth. And some suspect a bolt from the blue, a lightning strike into the ocean.How life started on Earth may forever be a mystery, but new research proposes a radical idea: that crashing waves and waterfalls may have kicked off the process by throwing up mists of water.In experiments at Stanford University, chemists discovered that microdroplets in fine sprays of water generate streaks of “microlightning”. When surrounded by the right mix of gases, these sparks power chemical reactions that synthesise many molecules for life.Prof Richard Zare, a chemist who led the team, said: “This is a real contribution to understanding how you can go from non-life to life. You have water sprays all over the place, particularly around rocks, and there are crevices in rocks where these chemicals can accumulate.”There is no consensus about the origins of life, and no shortage of hypotheses. When Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859 he described how evolution generated the diversity of life, but not how it started. He speculated, however, that chemicals could have interacted in “a warm little pond” from which living cells eventually emerged.Hot undersea ventsthat spew mineral-rich fluids are now considered to be leading contenders for fostering life.Impacting cometsmay have helped, too, by creating shock waves that converted simple organics into amino acids, the constituents of proteins.Lightning strikesmight also have lent a hand. The idea that lightning created the ingredients for life gained traction in 1953 when Stanley Miller and Harold Urey at the University of Chicagoreportedthat electrical discharges in a simulated early Earth atmosphere produced amino acids. But the hypothesis has its critics: lightning is too infrequent, they say, and the chemicals produced simply drift away.Zare’s team took to a dark room to investigate the electrical properties of water sprays. They found that droplets carry opposing charges and when they come together, tiny sparks leap between them. Unlike lightning bolts that cover miles, microlightning travels a few billionths of a metre.While the effect is faint, it carries enough energy to drive chemical reactions. Writing inScience Advances, the researchers describe how they sprayed water into a mixture of nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and ammonia. This led to the rapid formation of key molecules including hydrogen cyanide; glycine, an amino acid involved in protein production; and uracil, a building block of RNA found in all living cells. “We propose that this is a new mechanism for the prebiotic synthesis of molecules that constitute the building blocks of life,” Zare said.Dr Eva Stueeken, who studies the origins of life at the University of St Andrews, said the work was fascinating. “It opens up an array of possibilities that we need to explore further, using different gas and fluid compositions,” she said. “It will also be important to quantify how significant this mechanism would have been on a global scale for the generation of prebiotic molecules.”Prof David Deamer at the University of California, Santa Cruz,who has worked with Zarebut not on the latest study, said microlightning “can now be added to the list of possible energy sources available to drive organic synthesis before life began”.Explore more on these topicsEvolutionBiologynewsShareReuse this content"

There has been a move away from importing food aid in favour of using cash to help vulnerable people.Photograph: APAid workers also fear that successful malnutrition and cash-assistance programmes may be sacrificed to focus more on food packages as a result of the sudden funding shortages and pressure from the US government, which sees political benefits in buying up surplus domestic produce for food aid.The world had 281.1 million people facing high levels of severe food insecurity in 2023, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO)most recent report, but the “stop work” orders issued by the US government in January have probably pushed millions more into hunger.As well as the cuts increasing malnutrition, aid workers are concerned that they will also affect the ability to treat them because of the closure of health clinics. According to the FAO, there are36 million acutely malnourished people, including 10 million with severe malnutrition.The situation has been compounded bycuts to the UK aid budgetfrom0.58% of the UK’s gross national income to 0.3%– a cut of about £6bn – to pay for increased defence spending.There are also concerns other donor countries may follow suit as they step up spending on arms, including Germany – the second-biggest overseas aid donor – where the incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has pledged asignificant increase in defence spending.Rein Paulsen, FAO’s emergencies director, said food aid was now being directed to only a limited number of the most extreme immediate cases.“About 200 million people in severe need – who are just one small shock or stress away from being in extreme need – are left behind,” he said. “The support being provided is focused on the very short term, aimed at keeping people alive for the coming weeks or months.”View image in fullscreenA Rohingya refugee collects her family’s food rations at a camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. The World Food Programme has halved food rations to the Rohingya.Photograph: UnicefOne aid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said their organisation was already seeing the effects of the “life-killing” cuts, with beneficiaries in Somalia forced into debt to buy food and a halt to a nutrition programme for breastfeeding mothers and children.Meg Sattler, ofGround Truth Solutions, which surveys recipients of aid, said malnourished children in Somalia were now dying as a result. She said her organisation had documented aid deliveries stopping in Darfur – the worst-hit region ofSudan’s civil war– and families having the cash payments they relied on stopped.“The reality is people are dying and they’re going to continue dying,” said Sattler.There is significant uncertainty about how the aid sector will respond to cuts by the US, Britain and most other European countries, and also concern that cash assistance and longer-term nutritional support could be sacrificed for a greater focus on in-kind assistance.Over the past 20 years there has been a growing move away from direct delivery of aid – such as sacks of grain being imported and distributed by an international organisation – to giving people small cash payments to allow them to make decisions for themselves and their families.The approach has proved highly successful and also keeps a better balance for economies as people can buy their food locally, supporting traders and markets, instead of having to walk, often for many miles, to collect heavy sacks of imported rations from distribution centres. Cash payments now make upmore than a third of WFP’s food assistance, amounting to $2.8bn in 2023.This year the UN appealed for $47bn (£36bn) for humanitarian needs, with food security accounting for a third of those requirements. In its call to supportfive regional refugee response programmesfor 2024 – for Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, South Sudan and Syria – the UN said it would be targeting at least 20 million refugees.Paulsen said 85% of the UN’s humanitarian aid went on in-kind food and cash payments. He said that even in crisis zones, emergency agriculture could help prevent hunger more efficiently than direct food aid, with FAO assistance helping to produce $2.7bn worth of food in 2022 for a cost of $470m, and gave people more predictable and nutritious sources of food. Paulsen said such projects with farmers meant that 50 million people would not need emergency aid.View image in fullscreenA Rohingya refugee infant suffering from severe acute malnutrition has a check-up at a refugee camp in Bangladesh. The aid cuts have also closed clinics.Photograph: Ilvy Njiokiktjien/UnicefBut there are fears that the US will now revert to the outdated policies of aid delivery, especially in shipping grain.The US already buys up surplus produce from its farmers and distributes it as aid. In 2022,USAid spent $2.6bnprocuring 1.8m tonnes of goods from US producers – including sorghum, maize, beans, rice and vegetable oil.Campbell said the political motivation was likely to win out over what had proved to deliver the best results. “They have to have a market and a place to put their excess wheat and the way they have been doing it is that the US government was buying it and giving it away for free.“I think to the extent that US humanitarian food-assistance support continues, it is highly likely that it will be in kind,” she said.Alexandra Rutishauser-Perera, head of nutrition for Action AgainstHunger, said the aid sector was again in “emergency mode” to feed people in crisis, after setbacks from Covid, a series of conflicts and the climate crisis. Aid agencies would increasingly need to rely on fundraising from the public and from private donors to provide the more comprehensive programmes on malnutrition and food security, she said.While the shift towards cash assistance was seen as progress, many in the global south wanted to see international agencies go much further, empowering governments and local organisations, which are too often not consulted on their own communities.US shutdown of HIV/Aids funding ‘could lead to 500,000 deaths in South Africa’Read moreDr Rattan Lal, an Indian-born scientist who wasawarded the 2020 World Food prizefor his work on soil fertility, said there should be no shortages of food anywhere in the world, but that people needed to be given the ability to produce their own.“Famine is really a human-made tragedy,” he said. “Food insecurity and malnutrition is not because we are not producing enough. It is a problem of poverty, access, war, political strife and other social-economic issues.”View image in fullscreenA 16-year-old mother with her twins in Somalia, which has been through the worst drought in four decades followed by floods.Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPAHe said sub-Saharan Africa, where food insecurity was high, had the land and conditions to become self-sufficient but investment was needed to help agriculture thrive.“We need action to ensure everyone can produce locally. What has happened inUS politicsnow will happen again and again, and the solution is be self-sufficient,” he said.Degan Ali, the Somalian-born co-founder of the Network for Empowered Aid Response (Near), of civil society organisations from developing countries, said other than in situations where government rule had broken down, emergency aid should be organised locally.She said that international aid groups had grown and taken on the role of governments, disempowering instead of assisting them, including in Somalia.“You haven’t created any food self-sufficiency, any systems where people don’t need you any more. You haven’t helped people go back to their farms, rebuild their farms, get out of these camps and go back to farming,” she said.“Part of reinventing the new system is to say we’re done with the old aid model, where we balloon international organisations and the UN agencies. The system is so broken because there’s no incentive to scale down. There’s no incentive to say: ‘I don’t need the money, go give it to the government, give it to local organisations.’”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentAidUSAidHungerTrump administrationUS politicsUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Tate’s X account has featured a near constant stream of conspiracy theories and vitriol directed at those he blames for his situation, including Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, and attorney general, James Uthmeier.DeSantis has said the brothers’ brand of toxic masculinity was “not welcome” in his state, while Uthmeier, who has called their alleged behavior “atrocious”,warned the Tatesthat “fleeing our jurisdiction will not stop Florida’s ongoing criminal investigation”.In a post on X, Uthmeier wrote: “We will continue working with our law enforcement and partners around the world to fight human trafficking and sexual abuse”.Joseph McBride, the Tates’ attorney, told the Guardian in a statement that the Florida investigation was “a weak attempt by a lame-duck governor to hold on to power and an unknown attorney general aiming to build his reputation”, and that Uthmeier’s comments were “malicious and defamatory”.Both Tates, who are dual US-UK citizens, continue to denyallegations against them in Romania, which include human trafficking, rape of a minor and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. Travel restrictions following their 2022 arrest were lifted last month amidspeculation of a “secret deal”between prosecutors and the Trump administration.The US president’s son, Donald Trump Jr, has previously called their detention in Romania “absolute insanity”, while Trump himself denied any knowledge of their release.The Financial Timesreported last month, however, that McBride had lobbied members of Congress to speak up for them; and that the US special envoy Richard Grenell, a Trump acolyte, raised the case with Romania’s foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, at the Munich Security Conference in February.Asked about the president’s influence as he arrived for a podcast recording in Fort Lauderdale last week, Andrewreplied: “Trump is such a boss, he is such a gangster. As for Ron [DeSantis], I’m disappointed.”On Monday, meanwhile, Andrew Tateposted to his 10.8 million followerson X that he was heading back to Florida from California on Tuesday. He challenged authorities to arrest him upon his arrival.“Every day you don’t arrest me proves you’re clowns talking lies for political points,” he wrote. “Come and get me if I’m guilty and charge me in a court of law.”The Guardian contacted the Florida attorney general’s office for an update on the investigation, which Uthmeier said on 5 March involved search warrants, subpoenas and the seizure of the Tates’ electronics upon their arrival.Other than popping up for a couple ofpodcast appearances, the Tates have kept a relatively low profile since landing in Florida on 27 February and being whisked away by a large security team.Journalists have been unable to establish where in south Florida they have been staying, or with whom. Their social media feeds have provided a myriad of contradictions, alongside a series ofwild attackson DeSantis, Uthmeier and reposting unfounded claims about a “south Florida Jewish mob” the 38-year-old former kickboxer believes is out to get him.For example, in a post on 6 MarchAndrew Tate“thanked” Florida for welcoming him and promised he would “see you in a few years”; later the same day, he announced he had changed his mind and had “bought a Miami penthouse”; and four days after that, he was floating a plan to travel to Jamaica and “hang out” with a little-known fellow “influencer” called Biggs Don.In between, he announced he was in California and tweeted at the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, to file charges against him.Andrew Tate, who has become increasinglyaligned with Trumpin recent years, and his 36-year-old brother, are required to return to Romania to answer bail conditions before the end of this month, which McBride said they would do. After that, Tate said, he plans to becomea permanent resident of Florida.Yet the depth of his fury for what he perceives as persecution by state officials became evidentin a podcasthe recorded last week with the rightwing hostCandace Owens, who like Tate has been previously suspended from social media platforms for extremist content.“I could have chosen anywhere. I could have gone [to] Thailand, I could have gone [to] Dubai,” he said.“I thought, ‘You know what, let me go home’. And this is the welcome I get.”Explore more on these topicsAndrew TateFloridaHuman traffickinganalysisShareReuse this content"

I bought an engagement ringLora BetteridgeFri 14 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 13.20 EDTShareThe first time I saw Rachel was on Bumble. We matched, but then both ended up taking a break from dating apps. So when we reconnected on Tinder a few months later, in February 2020, it felt like fate.She exuded confidence and had bright blue eyes – I was into her straight away. We chatted for a couple of weeks in the early days of Covid, and when it became clear it wasn’t going away, we made a plan for a date, eager to meet in person before any restrictions were implemented.We knew we didn’t have much time, and only lived an hour apart in Kent, so I said, “Tomorrow, I’m going to get up at 4am, drive to pick you up, and you can stay for the weekend.”We didn’t tell anyone what we were doing, which in hindsight seems mad. There were news reports about police stopping cars and questioning drivers. I was so nervous – I had to pull over at the side of the road a few times to get a hold of myself.I met Rachel at 5am in a car park. We set off for my house, thinking it would just be for a couple of days, but then lockdown was announced later that day. She ended up staying and forming a bubble with me.From the outset, it felt as if we’d known each other for ages. We spent our days walking to the lake near my house, and our nights drinking gin and talking for hours.Four days after Rachel arrived, I woke up and instinctively got two mugs out of the cupboard. I suddenly thought, “This is how it’s going to be now.”I bought an engagement ring online that day. I didn’t propose for another seven months, but at that moment I just felt like, “Yeah, this is it.” I had no idea what Rachel’s ring size was, so I had to get her to try it on when it arrived. She loved it, but also thought I was insane.Experience: I lost my nose. Now I have seven different ones to choose fromRead moreGetting used to living with someone who was essentially a stranger provided some interesting moments. My house was very much my space before Rachel moved in. She’s messy, I’m tidy, and I remember thinking, “This is chaos. Everything is everywhere.” We didn’t have any disagreements, though, and we still rarely argue.At first, we kept our relationship secret, but after two weeks, it was getting annoying sending Rachel out of the room during family Zoom calls. I called my mum and said, “I’m really sorry, I’ve got a confession to make.”I had two cats at the time, so the first thing she thought was that I had got a kitten or a puppy. When I flipped the camera round to show Rachel, my mum, who is very loud and outspoken, responded, “I wish you’d just bought a goddamn puppy!” My dad didn’t say much, bless him.I proposed in October that year. I was planning on doing it at a dinner with our families, but we’d gone into a second lockdown by then, so it was just us at home, the way it had been all those months ago.We wanted to get married in the March or April 2022, because that would be two years since we’d met. After looking for a while, the venue we loved came back to us and said, “We do have a date free: it’s 1 April.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It was almost snowed off but we were eventually saved by glorious sunshine.Our son Leo was born in July last year, after my first round of IVF. He’s a happy baby and despite the sleepless nights, we’re enjoying being parents. It will be strange explaining to him about lockdown and how we met. But that experience definitely strengthened our relationship.I can’t believe it’s been five years since we started this weird, whirlwind adventure. We’ve gone from strangers in a car park, to wives, to parents. Maybe we’ll celebrate the five-year anniversary of our first date lockdown style – with Zoom and plenty of gin.We both said at the beginning, “You’re either going to completely ruin my life or you’re going to complete my life.” It’s the craziest thing that both of us have done.

It was a spectacular defeat, not just for Congolese forces, but also for the Europeans whom the government had hoped would protect Goma.Congolese leaders have a history of employing white mercenaries. They led infamous campaigns against rebels in the turbulent years afterindependence from Belgiumin 1960. Former Congolese dictator Mobutu Sese Seko also hired ex-Yugoslav mercenaries as his regime collapsed in the 1990s.View image in fullscreenThe DRC’s commander in chief, Maj Gen Louis Bobozo (left) with the French mercenary Col Bob Denard in Kisangani in October 1966.Photograph: Bettmann/Getty ImagesIn late 2022, with the M23 surrounding Goma, the DRC government hired two private-military firms. One, named Agemira, was made up of about 40 former French security personnel who provided intelligence and logistical support to the Congolese army.The bulk of the mercenaries came from a second firm headed by Horațiu Potra, a Transylvanian and former French legionnaire, known for handling security for politicians and mining sites inAfrica. At their height, Potra’s men in DRC, who were predominantly Romanian, numbered about 1,000. In security circles, they were known as “the Romeos”.The operation was sloppy, marred by pay disputes and equipment shortages. It deployed ex-members of the security forces but also untrained recruits, such as supermarket guards, according to a one-year joint investigation from the Guardian, Romania’s Public Record and Belgium’s Le Soir. The Romeos also worked closely with local militias and participated in combat.As Congolese and allied military forces around Goma crumbled between 27 and 28 January, the Romeos made a run for the main UN base in the city centre, abandoning equipment, rifles and jeeps. “They were imminently going to be killed,” says a senior UN official, who asked to remain anonymous. M23 fighters then arrived at the UN base and gave the Romeos two hours to surrender. Some scaled the walls of the adjacent Serena Hotel to look down into the compound, creating panic inside.View image in fullscreenMembers of the M23 rebel group in Goma supervise the exit of mercenaries on 29 January, a day after M23 and Rwandan forces captured the city.Photograph: Arlette Bashizi/Reuters“It was a real, real crisis,” says the senior UN official, who added that high-stakes negotiations involving world presidents led to an extraction deal, an account confirmed by two other UN sources.After the M23 military spokesperson had finished scolding them, the Romeos boarded UN buses with caged windows. More than 280 mercenaries from the original 1,000 – many left before Goma’s fall – were driven to the Rwandan border and flown home. At least four had been killed during their two-year deployment in North Kivu province. “It was a circus,” says one Romanian ex-special forces member, who stayed in the DRC for only six weeks because conditions were so dire.In 2022, word had spread quickly in Romanian security circles that Potra was recruiting. Underpaid men with mortgages and families jumped at the opportunity. Some, like Potra, were ex-French foreign legionnaires. Some were just his mates. Others were security guards, or former (and serving) army or police, who sometimes took unpaid leave to sign up.On arrival in Goma, contractors signed a three-page contract. The salary was between $5,000-$6,000 (3,900-£4,600) a month, depending on seniority, according to four different contracts signed between 2022 and 2024 and seen by the Guardian.View image in fullscreenHoratiu Potra, whose firm recruited as many as 1,000 Romanians to work with the Congolese army.Photograph: Octav Ganea/Inquam PhotosInitially, they signed with a UK-registered company called GPH La Role Ltd, owned by Potra’s brother, before contracts were transferred to a Congolese-registered company, Amani Sarl. The contract was three months on, one month off, with no medical insurance. Potra’s company provided a bulletproof vest and an AK-47. Any other equipment, the contractors had to buy for themselves.For Victor Railean, a Moldovan private security officer who first met Potra in 2019, this nonetheless represented a significant opportunity. He went to DRC to build a nest egg for his son, whom he loved “madly”, according to his sister Victoria Gonț. Railean was shot in February 2024 during an ambush in the volcanic hills about 15 miles (25km) from Goma. He died from his wounds. Vasile Badea, a former Romanian policeman, was also killed that day. Their group had requested extraction beforehand, according to WhatsApp voice recordings reviewed by the Guardian.They were lying about our numbers. Instead of having 100 people in the field, they had 70. In the end, the company’s goal was profitContractorOne contractor told Potra during the battle: “We can’t move because they’re hunting us with snipers. If we leave here they’ll blow your head off.”A survivor of the ambush told the Guardian: “Very big mistakes were made, they were pointed out, they weren’t rectified. As a result, boys died.”Five contractors described a disorganised operation, with untrained and unsuitable recruits. Two western officials in Goma estimated that only about 30% of the contractors had served in the French Foreign Legion.“When you bring in truck drivers, security guards and people over 60 … I realised this wasn’t well organised, so I asked to go home,” says the recruit who described Potra’s private military firm as “a circus”.View image in fullscreenRomanian contractors in Sake, North Kivu, after an M23 rebel offensive in the region in April 2023.Photograph: De Viguerie Veronique/Paris Match/GettyThe contractors were deployed to fortified positions near frontlines in hills north of Goma and around a contested satellite town to the north-west. Officially, their contracts stated they would conduct “training, qualification and certification of local security staff”.Felix Tshisekedi, the president of the DRC, hasdeniedthey were mercenaries, saying they provided “coaching” on the battlefield.

In some cases, they said they fired artillery themselves.One, with combat experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, says mortar teams fired at M23 positions during two weeks in spring 2024.

There were also tensions within the Congolese troops – paid about $100 a month – over the mercenaries’ salaries.The DRC is among the five poorest countries in the world,accordingto the World Bank, and more than 70% of the population survives on less than $2.15 a day. According to four contractors, Potra’s firm overcounted the manpower numbers.“They were lying about our numbers. Instead of having 100 people in the field, they had 70,” said one contractor, explaining that he’d pretended to live in four different housing units to fool inspectors. Contractors also perceived equipment shortages as cost-cutting measures. “In the end, the company’s goal was profit,” said one.Neither Potra nor the Congolese presidency responded to requests for comment. The Congolese army spokesperson said he had “no comment to make”.The fall of Goma: 16 days of chaos and fear – in picturesRead moreThe M23 captured large territories in eastern DRC after launching an offensive in late 2021.

Some of the militias have been accused of war crimes, which could make the Romeos complicit, according to legal experts the Guardian spoke to.However, it is not clear which militia groups they cooperated with, as none of the fighters interviewed specified. One contractor says the relationship was strained “until we started giving them money”.Security officials say the Romeos were aware of legal limits to their engagements. Contractors interviewed insist they weren’t mercenaries. “If you’re from the west, you’re a military contractor. If you’re from the east, you’re a mercenary,” scoffs one.Whether a military contractor is legally a mercenary is complex, but it can have consequences in jurisdictions such as France, which bans mercenary activity. Many Romanian instructors, as former legionnaires, have French nationality.View image in fullscreenSome of the men who worked in DRC say they are now struggling to find work after being labelled as mercenaries.Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters“These actors are multiplying and it’s crucial to consider creating an independent investigative body that could support accountability efforts,” says Jelena Aparac, former president of the UN Working Group on the use of mercenaries.Last year, Potra hosted a journalist from Romania’s public broadcaster to observe his men training Congolese troops. However, one contractor says that was set up: “We only pretended to train people when the press came.” Another says he is struggling to find work after being labelled a mercenary. “It’s a problem we all have. Barely any of us can get hired now.”This independent investigation was supported by grants fromJournalismfund Europe, theIJ4EU fundand theHenry Nxumalo FoundationandViewfinder.

Patrick Wintour and Pjotr Sauer reportAfter weeks of diplomatic tension, on Tuesday the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, announced thatUkrainehad signed up to a 30-day ceasefire agreement. As the Guardian’s diplomatic editor,Patrick Wintour, explains toMichael Safi, this deal would cover the whole of Ukraine and by accepting it, Ukraine will again receive military aid and intelligence sharing from the US. However, issues such as borders, elections and Ukrainian membership of Nato or the EU are not a part of this deal and will need to be finalised at a later stage.Having followed Russian negotiations during the Syrian civil war, Wintour describes the Russians as ‘masters at delay’, and on Thursday nightVladimir Putinmade it clear that while he supported the US attempt to reach a deal he could not sign up to it as it stood.The Russian affairs correspondent,Pjotr Sauer, explains that with the Russians on the verge of expelling Ukrainian forces from their territory in Kursk, every day of delay leaves Putin in a stronger position. With Trump’s reputation as a ‘peacemaker’ on the line and Russia already facing heavy tariffs, Putin is also being courted with offers of future financial benefits for Russia if it was to accept a deal. Sauer says that while achieving a ceasefire agreement may take time, perceptions among Russians are quickly changing in favour of the US and against the rest ofEurope.Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/ReutersExplore more on these topicsRussiaToday in FocusVladimir PutinUkraineDonald TrumpTrump administrationEuropeUS foreign policy"

The contacts suggested both countries are determined to press ahead with Trump’s proposal despite international outrage and massive practical difficulties – or at least use the plan to force other actors in the region to come up with their own ideas for Gaza when hostilities finally end.Two officials from war-tornSudanconfirmed to the Associated Press that the Trump administration had approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians.Trump calls arrest of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil ‘first of many to come’Read moreOne said the contacts began even before Trump’s inauguration with offers of military assistance in the army’s fight against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives. Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. “This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,” said one official. “No one opened this matter again.”Ahmed Moalim Fiqi, Somalia’s foreign minister, did not confirm or deny any requests from Israel or the US but saidSomaliarejected any plan that would involve the use of its territory for the resettlement of other populations or would undermine the Palestinian people’s right to live peacefully on their ancestral land.Under Trump’s plan, Gaza’s more than 2 million residents would be permanently displaced to allow massive reconstruction as a high-end “international” leisure and business destination. Experts said any forced resettlementwas illegal under international law.Initially, Egypt and Jordan were suggested as destinations for displaced Palestinians, but both strenuously opposed the plan.Palestinians in Gaza have also rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have offered an alternative multibillion-dollar reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place.The White House says Trump “stands by his vision”.Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, US and Israeli officials also described to the Associated Press news agency contacts with Somalia and the breakaway Somaliland region. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place.Outreach from the US and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan, according to the US officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions.Israeli officials and the White House have declined to comment on the efforts. The offices of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and Ron Dermer, the Israeli minister who has been leading Israel’s postwar planning, also had no comment.Netanyahu has hailed Trump’s proposal as a “bold vision”, while Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister and a longtime advocate of what he calls “voluntary” emigration of Palestinians, has recently said that Israel was working to identify countries to take in Palestinians.International legal experts have told the Guardian that, given the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, any such emigration could be unlawful and potentially constitute a war crime.View image in fullscreenPalestinians receive food cooked by a charity kitchen in Rafah.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersSudan was among the four Abraham accord nations that agreed to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020 but was plunged almost immediately into a civil war marked by widespread atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the UN and rights groups.US officials, seemingly aware that few Palestinians would be keen to relocate to such a precarious state, attempted to sweeten any deal by offering a range of incentives to Sudan’s government, including an offer of assistance to the army in its fight against the RSF which, in turn, is backed by the United Arab Emirates, a significant US ally.The proposal, if accepted, would have meant the US backing a side it has accused of war crimes and joining the same side in the conflict as Russia, at a time when Vladimir Putin is contemplating the American proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine.Before the revelations, Sudan had already indicated it would not entertain any attempt to resettle Palestinians in a country coping with the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The head of Sudan’s army and de facto president, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan – subject of the US sanctions – last week told a summit in Cairo that his country “categorically rejects” any plan that aims to transfer “the brotherly Palestinians from their land under whatever justification or name”.The Guardian has contacted Sudan’s ministry of foreign affairs for comment.Somaliland, a territory of more than 3 million people in the Horn ofAfrica, seceded from Somalia more than 30 years ago, but it is not internationally recognised as an independent state.An American official involved in the efforts confirmed to the Associated Press that the US was “having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the US in exchange for recognition”.An official in Somaliland, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media, said his government had not been approached and was not in talks about taking in Palestinians.Somalia is an even more unlikely destination. Mogadishu has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians, and joined the recent Arab summit that rejected Trump’s plan. A Somali official told the Associated Press the country had not been approached about taking in Palestinians from Gaza and there had been no discussions about it.In recent years, Somalia has developed strong ties with Arab states and with Turkey. Much of the country is ruled byal-Shabaab, an extremist Islamist militia allied with al-Qaida.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpPalestinian territoriesIsraelSomaliaSomalilandSudanAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

First spotted as a depression last Friday to the south-west of the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, it intensified over the next few days to a moderate tropical storm, affecting northernMadagascaron Saturday and killing at least one person.Jude strengthened into a tropical cyclone as it tracked westwards over theMozambiqueChannel, where sea surface temperatures of close to 30C provided the heat and moisture necessary to fuel the cyclone.It hit Mozambique early on Monday morning, with sustained wind gusts of 75mph (120km/h) and gusts of up to 120mph, equivalent to a category 1 hurricane. More than 200mm of rain fell over the coastal districts of Memba, Monapo, Mossuril, Mozambique Island and Nacala in 24 hours, leading to significant flooding. Flights were grounded and 40,000 people were left without power. So far six fatalities have been linked to Jude and 900 homes have been destroyed.Although Jude has weakened, the system is forecast to curve back over the Mozambique Channel, heading eastwards towards southern Madagascar later this week. Some models are suggesting Jude could regain its tropical cyclone status by the time it reaches Madagascar’s shores on Friday night, bringing a further wave of destruction.Storm-raising, witches and the new conspiracist threat to weather researchRead moreSouth Africa was hit by heavy thunderstorms on Thursday, with KwaZulu-Natal province on a level 6 alert for heavy rain and flooding. A cold front sweeping over the region lifted up the warm air, which quickly condensed to form the storms. About 100mm of rain fell in 24 hours. Thunderstorms will continue on Friday but they will tend to be less intense.Perth in Western Australia was also battered by a severe thunderstorm on Thursday. Wind gusts of up to 70mph (113km/h) were reported, which brought down power lines and left thousands without power.

Polls show thatPeru’s president, Dina Boluarte, and the country’s congress have approval ratings of less than 5%.The law’s backers say it boosts transparency over funding for civil society and augments government oversight of foreign interference in state matters.Ahead of the vote, Alejandro Aguinaga, a lawmaker for the rightwing Fuerza Popular, accused NGOs of using international cooperation to “fill their pockets at the expense of Peru’s poorest”. Aguinaga, a former health minister, faces allegations he facilitated theforced sterilisationof thousands of rural Indigenous women.Carlos Rivera, director of the Legal Defense Institute, a Peruvian NGO, called it a “simply brutal” move. He said the law could have a devastating impact for the legal defense of the “victims of human rights violations, almost 100% of whom are handled by NGOs”.It was particularly concerning, he said, that the law made it a serious offense with a fine of up to $500,000 for NGOs to litigate or even legally support any administrative or judicial cases against the government, both nationally and internationally.“For me it is the most unconstitutional law passed Peru since the 1995 amnesty laws,” he said.The 1995 amnesty laws blocked prosecution against military and police for human rights abuses committed during the country’s 1980-2000 internal conflict against leftist armed groups, principally theShining Path. The abuses included forced disappearances, torture and massacres. The laws were later declared unconstitutional for violating the right to justice and breaching international human rights standards.Julia Urrunaga, Peru director at the Environmental Investigation Agency, said it was “absolutely false” that NGOs operated without accountability, insisting they are “subject to the same rules of the game as any other civil society entity” and had been reporting to the APCI for more than 20 years.“What is being done is to prevent civil society organisations from being able to act with independence and freedom, to be able to work in the defense of the human rights of citizens,” she said.The regional organisation for Amazon Indigenous people, Orpio, called the law a “serious step backwards in the defense of our fundamental rights and access to justice for Indigenous peoples”.Peru’s history of military rule, democratic instability and corruption means civil society organisations have played an important role in national development.But Peru’s ultra-conservative right has appealed to the narrative that USAid funds are used in Peru for political purposes. In February, Donald Trump cancelled83% of USAid foreign aid programmes.President Boluarte has joined the attack against NGOs. Speaking at an event last month, she said: “We cannot allow the discourse of human rights to be used as an ideological weapon to undermine the authority of the state and delegitimise the principle of order.”Boluarte is under investigation for the deaths of nearly 50 people inanti-government protests in December 2022 and January 2023. Prosecutors also accuse her ofaccepting bribes in the form of Rolex watchesand jewellery. She has denied any wrongdoing.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentRights and freedomPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

An interim document sets out broad policy guidance, much like Trump’s executive orders and public remarks, before a more considered policy document like a formal NDS.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The interim document was first reported by CNN. NBC News earlier on Thursday reported that the White House had ordered the Pentagon to create options for the Panama canal.Trump has asserted that the US needs to “take back” the canal, arguing, without evidence, that China controls it and could use the waterway to undermine American interests. In his inaugural speech in January, Trump accused Panama of breaking a promise for the final transfer of the canal in 1999.Ilya Espino de Marotta, the canal’s deputy administrator, told the Guardian in January: “The canal is run by Panamanians 100%.

Sounding frail and wearing a blue suit and tie, he spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth.Duterte’s lawyer, Salvador Medialdea, told the court that his client had been “abducted from his country”, adding: “He was summarily transported to The Hague. To lawyers it’s extrajudicial rendition. For less legal minds it’s pure and simple kidnapping.”Medialdea said Duterte would be unable to contribute to the proceedings because of what he termed his client’s “debilitating medical issues”. But Motoc said the court doctor who had examined Duterte was of the opinion that he was “fully mentally aware and fit”.The judge set a pre-trial hearing date of 23 September to establish whether the prosecution’s evidence is strong enough to send the case to trial. If a trial does go ahead, it could take years, and if Duterte is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.Duterte was arrested amid dramatic scenes three days ago. Despite threatening a police general with lawsuits, refusing to be fingerprinted and telling officers “you have to kill me to bring me to The Hague”, he eventually boarded the plane that arrived in theNetherlandson Wednesday.As he landed in The Hague, the former leader was calm andappeared to accept responsibilityfor his actions, saying in a Facebook video: “I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators in The Hague on 14 May demand justice for victims of Duterte’s ‘war on drugs’.Photograph: Peter Dejong/APHis arrest came amida spectacular breakdown in relationsbetween his family and the Marcos family, who had previously joined forces to run the Philippines.The current president, Ferdinand Marcos, and the vice-president, Sara Duterte – who is Rodrigo’s daughter – are at loggerheads, with the latter facing an impeachment trial over charges including an alleged assassination plot against Marcos.The senator, the priest, the forensic pathologist: the people who brought ex-president Duterte to justiceRead moreSara Duterte travelled to the Netherlands to support her father, whose arrest she has described as “oppression and persecution”. The Duterte family had sought an emergency injunction from the supreme court to stop his transfer.Speaking to supporters and reporters outside the court on Friday morning, she said she was hoping to visit her father and to have the hearing moved. “We are praying and hoping that the court will grant our request to move the initial appearance just so that we can properly sit down with the former president and discuss the legal strategies since we haven’t talked to him yet,” she told Agence France-Presse.View image in fullscreenA Duterte supporter demonstrates in front of the international criminal court in The Hague.Photograph: Freek van den Bergh/EPADuterte became president nine years ago after promising a merciless, bloody crackdown that would rid the country of drugs. On the campaign trail he once said there would beso many bodies dumped in Manila Baythat fish would grow fat from feeding on them. After taking office, he publicly stated he wouldkill suspected drug dealers, and urged the public to kill addicts.Estimates of the death toll under his administration rule vary: the national police put the number at 6,000 people, while human rights groups claim the true figure is five times higher. Most of the victims were men in poor, urban areas who were gunned down in the streets.Even as his tactics provoked international horror, he remained highly popular at home throughout his presidency. While his arrest has been celebrated by rights groups and the families of the victims of the “war on drugs”, it has also prompted some protests in his strongholds of Mindanao and the Visayas.Duterte, who appeared before asenate inquiry into the drugs war killingslast year, said he offered “no apologies, no excuses” for his policies, saying: “I did what I had to do, and whether you believe it or not, I did it for my country.”Campaigners and victims of his crackdowns hope that Duterte’s arrest will finally result in him facing justice for his alleged crimes.Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International’s south-east Asia researcher, said Friday’s hearing proved that no one was above the law.“The very institution that former President Duterte mocked will now try him for murder as a crime against humanity,” she said. “This is a symbolic moment and a day of hope for families of victims and human rights defenders who have for years fought tirelessly for justice despite grave risks to their lives and safety.”The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has hailed Duterte’s arrest as a key moment for victims and international justice as a whole.“Many say that international law is not as strong as we want, and I agree with that. But as I also repeatedly emphasise, international law is not as weak as some may think,” Khan said. “When we come together … when we build partnerships, the rule of law can prevail.”With Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsRodrigo DutertePhilippinesInternational criminal courtAsia PacificInternational criminal justiceHuman rightsNetherlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m visiting Beijing, and that’s what I’ll tell them | Ed MilibandRead moreEd Miliband, the UK’s energy and net zero secretary, arrived in Beijing on Friday for three days of talks with top Chinese officials, including discussions on green technology supply chains, coal and the critical minerals needed for clean energy. The UK’s green economy isgrowing three times faster than the rest of the economy, but access to components and materials will be crucial for that to continue.He said: “We can only keep future generations safe from climate change if all major emitters act. It is simply an act of negligence to today’s and future generations not to engageChinaon how it can play its part in taking action on climate.”Writing in the Guardian, he added: “Climate action at home without pushing other, larger countries to do their fair share would not protect current and future generations. We will only protect our farmers, our pensioners and our children if we get other countries of the world to play their part.”China is facing abarrage of tariffs from Trump on its exports to the US, and the possibility that theEU will start levying green tariffs on imports of high-carbon Chinese goods, such as steel.The world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter is profiting from recordexports of electric vehicles, solar panels and other low-carbon goods. But it is stillhighly dependent on coal, and though the upward march of its emissionsappears to have paused, whether China reduces its carbon output or returns to fossil fuels may depend largely on the government’s response to Trump’s trade war.Many experts believe the only prospect of staving off climate breakdown is for China, the EU, the UK and other major economies to form a pro-climate bloc alongside vulnerable developing countries, to counter the weight of US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and petrostates pushing for the continued expansion of fossil fuels.Miliband’s visit to Beijing is the first by a UK energy secretary in eight years. He visited India last month on a similar mission, and travelled to Brazil last year, as well as holding meetings with many minsters of developing countries at theCop29 climate summitlast November.Catherine Abreu, the director of the International Climate Politics Hub, said: “It’s really important to see this happening – there is no way to fulfil the Paris agreement without China. And China has made clear it is willing to be more vocal on these issues, to boost climate action. We see an openness in China to band together with Europe, Canada, the UK on climate issues.”But the prospects of agreement on the sharp emissions cuts needed globally to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, in line with the Paris agreement, are increasingly remote.Brazil will host this year’s UN climate summit, Cop30, in the Amazon in November amid the worst geopolitical tensions in decades, and as many governments prepare to pour money into rearmament.Only a handful of countries, including the UK, have so far submitted their national plans on emissions cuts for the next decade as required under the 2015 Paris agreement, despite thedeadline passing last month. China is unlikely to produce its plan until much closer to the Cop30 conference, and will be keenly watched, as its current carbon targets are much too weak to stay within the 1.5C limit.Miliband may find he needs to adapt his plans for a booming green economy in the UK in the face of China’s economic dominance of the low-carbon technology market, according to Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.“We need to be honest about the economic reality,” he said. “All countries in the world are hoping for a share of the green pie. But that is not aligned with the economic reality … that they can’t outcompete China.”Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsClimate crisisGreen economyRenewable energyChinaEd MilibandEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Xinhua/AlamyThe Loess plateau was the most eroded place on Earth until China took action and reversed decades of damage from grazing and farmingByHelen DavidsonFri 14 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 22.30 EDTShareIt was one of China’s most ambitious environmental endeavours ever.The Loess plateau, an area spanning more than 245,000 sq miles (640,000 sq km) across three provinces and parts of four others, supports about 100 million people. By the end of the 20th century, however, this land, once fertile and productive, was considered the most eroded place on Earth, according toa documentary by the ecologist John D Liu.Generations of farmers had cleared and cultivated the land, slowly breaking down the soil and destroying the cover. Every year, the dust from the plain jammed the Yellow River with silt (this is how the river gets its name), sending plumes of loess, a fine wind-blown sediment, across Chinese cities – including to the capital, Beijing.And so in 1999 the Chinese government took drastic emergency action with the launch of Grain to Green, a pilot project backed by World Bank funding, to regreen the plateau and reverse the damage done by overgrazing and overcultivation of the once forested hillsides that would become what the bank described in 2004 as “the largest and most successful water and soil conservancy project in the world” (pdf).View image in fullscreenEroded valleys and terracing in Loess plateau, Gansu, before the conservation project began.Photograph: Universal Images Group/GettyThe primary focus was to restore agricultural production and incomes in the plateau, but the dust storms descending on already polluted cities, “making people cough even more”, also became a driver, says Peter Bridgewater, an honorary professor at the Australian National University’s Centre for Heritage and Museum Studies.World Bank participants spent more than three years designing the project, working with experts as well as communities, officials and farmers on how to overturn the longstanding but unsustainable grazing and herding of livestock. Tree-cutting, planting on hillsides and uncurbed sheep and goat grazing were banned. The sustainable practices demonstrated in some small villages were scaled up.The project was extraordinarily ambitious, and was powered through by China’s authoritarian system. “If you want major change, the Chinese system is well adapted to making major change,” says Bridgewater wryly.There were grain and cash subsidies for people converting farmland to grassland, economic forest or protected ecological forest. There were tax subsidies and benefits to offset farming losses, long-term land use contracts and conversion to more sustainable farming including orchards and nuts, and widespread tree-planting employment programmes.By 2016, China had converted more than 11,500 sq miles of rain-fed cropland to forest or grassland – a 25% increase in vegetative cover in a decade, according to a study published in Nature Climate Change.Other studies showedlarge reductions in erosionandpositive changes in plant productivity.“When the environment improved, all the birds returned. The forest has developed its ecological system naturally,” the forestry worker Yan Rufengtold the state-run news channel CGTN.View image in fullscreenTerraces on the Loess plateau covered with layers of green wheat seedlings and dotted with golden rape flowers in Yuncheng, Shanxi province.Photograph: CFoto/Future Publishing/GettyIt wasn’t straightforward, however. There was some community resistance, particularly to demands to plant trees on farming land. “What about the next generation? They can’t eat trees,” said one man interviewed for Liu’s documentary.In the early years there also appeared to be a correlation between the project and a sudden drop in grain yield. Over the years, officials would debate whether the programme was harming China’s food security, although studiesfound there to be several factors at play, and that yields later improved.In hindsight, the early methods employed to regreen the dusty hills were also problematic. “There was a lot of mass tree planting – not necessarily natives – and in plantation format, in other words, monocultural stands,” says Bridgewater.Mass-species planting eventually began to replace the monoculture plantations, helping to increase wildlife, but there were also issues with water management, with the burgeoning tree cover and agriculture taking more and more water out of the Yellow River system.“It’s looking like there is a point at which the revegetation will become too successful in that it actually then swings the water balance of the landscape, reducing the potential for water to go into the rivers and be available for human use,” says Bridgewater.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But it’s a good lesson as to how all these interconnecting factors need to be thought about very carefully before you launch into these things.”View image in fullscreenEroded terraces on the Loess plateau, Shaanxi province, in 2007.Photograph: China Span Keren Su/Sunset/Rex/ShutterstockA big factor in the success and demands of the programme was and remains the changing climate. The plateau sits in a transition zone between arid and semi-humid climates. The varied natural factors of the region, combined with unsustainable human activity, hadcontributed to the fragility of the plateau, a 2021 study found. “At the same time, the climate in this region has shown warming and wetting, particularly in the south in which precipitation increased by 20-50 mm from 2000 to 2014.”The climate around the Loess plateau is changing, which means what existed, or even thrived, several decades ago can’t necessarily be put back, says Bridgewater. “But we can produce something, a system that will produce ecosystem services at a better range and a better quality and more regularly than the systems that we’ve destabilised.”View image in fullscreenAn aerival view of Loess plateau terraces after wheat harvest in Yuncheng, Shanxi province, in June.Photograph: NurPhoto/GettyBridgewater adds: “Given the speed of climate change, and not just climate but hydrology and all the other associated global changes, we need to be thinking about what we want. What we want out of our ecosystems are actually services.“We need to think actually in multi-dimensions … to develop a whole new way of thinking as to how we manage the landscape. And in a way, the whole Loess plateau project is a good example of that, [even if] that wasn’t the way of thinking at the start.”Lu FuChin, a former farmer, told the official state news outlet Xinhua that the programme had boosted local employment. “I used to cut trees for firewood, but now I grow them instead,” said the 52-year-old forestry worker. “It used to be that people had to go far for work, but now they can find employment by the Yellow River. As the environment is improving, I believe the villagers’ lives will become more prosperous too.”Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsThe alternativesConservationChinaSoilWaterFarmingRiversfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said China met the definition of a “foreign hostile force” under Taiwan’s anti-infiltration act and he had “no choice but to take even more proactive measures”.“China has been taking advantage of democratic Taiwan’s freedom, diversity, and openness to recruit gangs, the media, commentators, political parties, and even active-duty and retired members of the armed forces and police to carry out actions to divide, destroy, and subvert us from within,” Lai said.The most concrete measure announced was plans to re-establish a peacetime military court system to prosecute “military crimes as sedition, aiding the enemy, leaking confidential information, dereliction of duty, or disobedience”.Taiwan was ruled under brutal martial law for decades, and abolished its military court in 2014 after backlash over the handling of an investigation into the hazing-related death of a young recruit.Opposition parties – which hold the majority in Taiwan’s legislature and have been highly obstructionist to Lai’s agenda – have questioned the plan. Opposition KMT legislator Wang Hung-wei said her party wasn’t “totally against it” but accused the ruling DPP of backflipping on its long-held positions. Another opposition party, the TPP, said the proposal would send Taiwan backwards on human rights.In his speech Lai flagged tightening restrictions on Chinese travellers andnew residents, as well as monitoring of Taiwanese people working or travelling in China.Taiwan has prosecuted dozens of current and former military personnel who have beenrecruited as spies for Beijing, and has criticised Taiwanese entertainers and influencers for endorsing Beijing’s claims over Taiwan and spreading propaganda, Lai said.This weeka Chinese-born resident was expelledfor posting online content endorsing a Chinese invasion. China has also been offering an unknown number of Taiwanese citizens Chinese residency or passports, which Lai said was “an attempt to muddle Taiwanese people’s sense of national identity”.China’s government this week concludedits annual Two Sessions political meeting, during which officials emphasised their continued objective to annex Taiwan andpunish leaders it sees as “separatists”. Officials at the Two Sessions reiterated a preference for peaceful “reunification”, buthardened languagearound a willingness to use military force if necessary.Chen Binhua, spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, had said on Wednesday: “If the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces provoke, exert pressure, or dare to cross the red line, resolute actions will be taken in response.”On Friday morning Taiwan’s defence ministry said 12 fighter jets, seven navy vessels and one “official” ship (likely coast guard) had been detected around Taiwan since 6am. It said nine of the jets crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

She has now been replaced by a new lead plaintiff, a second woman, who claims Astill inappropriately touched her on multiple occasions.In 2023, Astill was jailed for a maximum of 23 years for abusing his position and assaulting women at the Dillwynia correctional centre. A former police officer, he worked as a prison officer and then chief correctional officer at the prison before his arrest in 2019.He was found guilty last year of 27 charges, including aggravated sexual and indecent assault before the government then launched the inquiry.The inquiry handed down its report last March and found Astill should “never have been employed” in the state’s prisons. It said “corruption or incompetence” led to Corrective Services NSW hiring him in 1999.Guardian Australia understands the total number of plaintiffs in the class action is not yet finalised, but 3,700 notices have been sent to current and former inmates at the prison.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailCourt documents relating to claims from GP1 alleged the scope of authority that the department allocated to Astill meant “he could be regarded as the mind and the will of the department of justice”.GP1 alleged the abuse began in 2016 at a time when the department allegedly knew Astill “was abusing his position toward female inmates”. Astill had allegedly attempted to bribe her by saying he would provide her information on the welfare of a loved one if she performed sexual favours for him, according to court documents.View image in fullscreenWayne Astill in 2022.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPLater that year, Astill allegedly raped GP1. He allegedly did again in 2017.“Astill told the plaintiff to look normal, not to tell anyone of the abuse, and that he could make her life hell,” the statement of claim said of the 2017 incident.‘Bad case note’ and paroleIn 2018, it is alleged he groped GP1 while she waited to see a doctor at the prison.The statement of claims said Astill advised GP1 “it would only take a bad case note for her to not get parole”.“Astill had told the plaintiff that no one would believe her if she reported the matter.”GP1 did not report the abuse because she feared nobody would believe her and feared retribution, the claim said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

During the meeting, she alleges Astill slapped and grabbed hold of her buttocks.The next year, while she was sweeping up with a dustpan and brush, he allegedly stood by her in “a sexually suggestive manner”, leading her to fear Astill was about to expose himself to her or touch her sexually, the court documents said.In another alleged incident, while she was placed in isolation, Astill entered her cell after lock-in time and commented on her buttocks, according to court documents. The following night, while she was still in isolation, he entered her cell and allegedly grabbed her around the waist and tried to kiss her.“The conduct of Astill … was interrupted by another correctional officer at which time Astill left the plaintiff’s cell,” the statement of claim said.The department’s defence to the second woman’s statement of claims has not been filed yet.“The Department of Communities and Justice is unable to comment as this matter is before the court,” a spokesperson said.The government is responding to the wide-ranging recommendations made during the inquiry into Astill’s conduct.Last month the state government changed the law so any sexual relationships between prison staff and inmates is illegal, with staff facing a potential prison sentence.“Such behaviour indicates a deplorable abuse of the staff’s position and a breach of their duty of care to the inmate,” the corrections minister, Anoulack Chanthivong, said.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

The snap judgement I made in these moments was never from a place of harm or stealing a joey.“While I was unbelievably excited to see such an amazing animal, I looked it over quickly and immediately returned it to its mother. I ensured that the mother and joey did reunite, went off together, and that they got off the road.“I have done a great deal of reflection on this situation and have realized that I did not handle this situation as best as I should have … I have learned from this situation, and am truly sorry for the distress I have caused.”Attacking a young tourist over her treatment of a wombat is hypocritical – and misses the point | Georgie PurcellRead moreShe insisted that the incident had not simply been confected for content.“I want to make it absolutely clear that this was never about social media or getting likes.“This was not staged, nor was it done for entertainment. In my excitement and concern, I acted too quickly and then failed to provide necessary context to viewers online.”Burke, who is also the immigration minister, said on Thursday that he couldn’t “wait to see the back of this individual” and authorities were “working through the conditions” on Jones’s visa to determine “whether immigration law has been breached”.The Australian prime minister,Anthony Albanese, said Jones’s actions were “an outrage” and suggested she should try to “take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there”.RSCPA Australia said the footage showed a “blatant disregard” for native wildlife and the distress to the joey and the mother caused by the “callous act” was clear.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeAnimalsAustralian immigration and asylumSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

Nor Canada’s escalating war of invective and retaliatory sanctions.Surface tension: could the promised Aukus nuclear submarines simply never be handed over to Australia?Read moreAustralia, instead, got a desultory dismissal in the corridors of the White House – from a staffer: Canberra’s plea to be exempted from the punitive new regime disregarded.“[President Trump] considered it, and considered against it.”That was all.But it’s not really about the tariffs.It’s what the tariff decision says about Australia’s relationship with the US, and the weight a historical alliance carries with a muscular new administration that cares little for history, even less for convention.From the Australian side, the US relationship remains one cast consistently as “special”, almost familial. It is abiding and reciprocal, cloaked in the semi-sacred rhetoric of Anzus, of “mateship”, of “shared values”.But from Washington’s end the relationship, always asymmetrical, is looking increasingly immaterial.Perhaps that is the alliance under Trump: unremarkable, transactional, even disposable.Director of the International & Security Affairs program at theAustralia Institute, Dr Emma Shortis, argues that, in the broad sweep of Australia’s economic relations with the US, specific tariffs on steel and aluminium will not be hugely impactful.But she argues “politically and symbolically, it’s incredibly important because it is Trump demonstrating once again that he has absolutely no care for how his actions affect the United States’ traditional allies”.Australia, she contends, tends still to think it can get special treatment from the US because of its longstanding relationship “and because of how much we’ve given the United States in the past”.“But with this refusal to even engage in the idea of a carveout, Trump has thrown all of that out the window.”Shortis, author ofOur Exceptional Friend: Australia’s Fatal Alliance with the United States, argues that, for all of the fraternal rhetoric, the alliance between the US and Australia has always been asymmetric. She contends this is no criticism, rather a realistic reflection of the dramatic power imbalance between the two countries.At its best, the US-Australia relationship aspires to uphold and promote those values shared – and so often espoused – by the two countries: belief in democratic institutions, in the rule of law, and in the international, rules-based order. Too often though, it has focused narrowly on immediate national interest.Australian meat could be next on the menu for Trump’s ‘bonkers’ tariffsRead more“And with the Trump administration, things are changing rapidly because even the pretence, I think, of caring about allies and their welfare is gone.”Trump sees his own interests and those of the United States as indistinguishable, Shortis says.Aukus a ‘step-change’But a changed America is producing a changed Australian opinion of it.AnAustralia Institute pollreleased this month found three in 10 Australians (31%) think Donald Trump is the greatest threat to world peace (more than chose Vladimir Putin (27%) or Xi Jinping (27%)).It found nearly half of all Australians (48%) were not confident the Trump administration would defend Australia’s interests if Australia were threatened, compared with only 16% who were very confident that it would do so.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“I think that’s a pretty significant shift in how people think about the alliance itself and more broadly what actually makes us safer,” Shortis says. “The question really becomes: does tying ourselves so irrevocably to Donald Trump’s version of America through Aukus actually make us safer or does that make things more dangerous for us and more dangerous for our region and the world?”Long after he had left the Lodge, former prime minister Malcolm Fraser echoed that thought, writing – at age 83 – that America had transmogrified into Australia’s most “dangerous ally”.The emerging centrepiece of Australia’s security alliance with the US is the Aukus agreement, which –if it proceeds as promised– will see US nuclear-powered submarines sold to Australia.The deal is a “step-change” in Australian dependence on the US, Shortis argues. While historically Australia’s position has been to follow the US into conflicts, it has always had the choice to do so or not.“Aukus makes Australian participation in US wars the default setting.”‘We have to be clear-eyed’Trump’s America is a changed land, Arthur Sinodinos says.Theformer ambassador to the US– in the post during Trump’s first term in office – Sinodinos has witnessed America’s evolution over decades, stretching back to his days as chief of staff to former prime minister John Howard and the administration of George W Bush.The Trump administration, especially in its sharpened, second iteration, is categorically different from those that came before it. But Sinodinos says: “There’s no point mourning the passing of [the US’s] role in underwriting the global rules-based order. This is the new world we’re in. Australia has to act accordingly.“We just have to be very clear-eyed about what is our national interest in dealing with the US and act accordingly.”From Washington DC, Sinodinos tells the Guardian that Australia remains, and will remain, an ally to the US, but it must accept “this is the new world Australia is in: we need a new mindset in this world”.“The defence and security relationship remains very important to us. It would be hard for us to replicate this if we didn’t have the US and therefore we need to put effort into maintaining the commitment of the US to the alliance by showing how essential it is to the US’s own security.”Australia, in its dealings with its larger partner, needs to consistently demonstrate why the alliance is of benefit to America – in security terms (such asjoint bases on Australian soil), in economic relationships, and in new areas of potential cooperation such as critical minerals.“Ask not what America can do for you, but what you can do for America,” Sinodinos says. “It’s ‘America first’, we want to try to make sure it’s not ‘America only’.”Sinodinos argues, while the decision not to exempt Australia from steel and aluminium tariffs may have felt targeted, it was anything but individualised. He cautions against reading too much into it.“It was a generic decision. The Trump administration has determined to have higher tariffs. They want to make money out of tariffs,” Sinodinos says.‘Australians have been living in a fool’s paradise’Dr Allan Patiencebelieves Trump’s second administration, rather than change the nature of America’s alliance with Australia, has simply exposed the deep structural flaws that have always existed.“Australians have been living in a fool’s paradise about America since 1951,” argues the associate professor at the University of Melbourne, referring to the year theAnzus treatywas signed.Trump pick for Pentagon says selling submarines to Australia would be ‘crazy’ if Taiwan tensions flareRead more“The belief, for generations now, has been that America is our most trustworthy, reliable ally, that it loves Australia, and that they’ll come over the Pacific Ocean … should we ever be in any sort of trouble. That’s not what the Anzus treaty has ever said.”Besides, alliances have never been eternal and immutable, Patience argues. They are – to quoteJohn Mearsheimer– always “marriages of convenience” built on the shifting sands of fickle self-interest.But a steadfast US alliance has been a useful placatory myth in domesticAustralian politics, used by leaders of all stripes.Patience argues that Australia’s deep sense of insecurity, fanned by a distrust in its geopolitical location in the Asia-Pacific, has caused it to depend too heavily on the US as its “great and powerful friend”.Australia needs to understand and accept the limitations of the US alliance – “it hasn’t worked and doesn’t work” – and look to build a new diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region. In the 1980s, Bob Hawke spoke of Australia becoming “enmeshed” in Asia. In the decade that followed, Paul Keating urged Australia “to seek its security in Asiarather than from Asia”.Patience advocates building new alliances in the region, forging stronger ties with other liberal democracies, in particular South Korea and Japan, and developing a “sophisticated diplomacy” with China.“I think Australia is in very serious trouble because of this naive belief in America. We’ve been such fools living in this imagined American paradise for so long.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian politicsDonald TrumpAukusanalysisShareReuse this content"

There is much to consider – from cost and capacity to the behavioural changes that can boost efficiency. Here, Guardian readers make it easy by sharing their experiences and offering key pieces of advice for how to get the most out of it.How to maximise cost savingsSign up to a wholesale power price retailer so you can charge and export power when it’s financially advantageous. Also, if you have an EV, you can charge for free from solar, or buy super-cheap (under 10c/kWh) power from the grid when it’s windy, sunny and not too hot.– Mark, Woodend, VictoriaIt is unlikely that you will be entirely off the grid with a battery so I recommend hunting for the lowest possible grid electricity prices (what you pay) for when you need to draw off the grid, and don’t worry about the feed-in tariff (what the grid pays you for your surplus) as feed-in tariffs are always stupidly low and make no discernible difference to your bills.– Peter, Burrawang, NSWWe always keep 25% in backup; since installing the battery to our existing solar system we have saved $11,846.– Alan, Port Pirie, South AustraliaJoin a retailer that allows you to access the wholesale market, just like the big batteries. That way you can sell energy from your battery during price spikes for up to $17/kWh (yes, dollars not cents).– Søren, Canberra, ACTElectric v hybrid: which vehicle should you buy in 2025?Read moreConsider how much capacity you’ll needI have a 10kWh battery with micro inverters on the roof. Mostly off-grid now except for winter mornings. Will add more battery capacity later. We need 10kWh plus for a house with electric heating and cooling.– Alan, Murrumbeena, VictoriaBigger is better. I have 16kW and it is just enough to heat a well insulated house in winter.– David, Moe, VictoriaSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailGo big. I have a 22 kW solar system with 54 kW of battery storage and an EV. I have not paid a power bill since 2017. I am now around $10,000 a year better off. I charge the car at home overnight (I’ve never paid to charge it), on average 8 kW a charge. We abolished gas so the house is fully electric. We have no problem running air con and heating. Our house is 100 years old.– Anonymous, Brisbane, QueenslandShift your mindsetThe one thing to be aware of is that jumping into solar/battery needs a behavioural change. If you’re expecting a set-and-forget solution you will get a very small benefit from the whole thing. You need to check power prices during the day, when is a good time to sell, to charge from the grid when prices are low, to use your power-hungry appliances, etc. The mindset shift is critical, way before installing anything.– Jorge, Caringbah south, NSWTo ensure you are using only battery-stored power, monitor your use of appliances in the household to avoid drawing too much power at once. This can all be done in your phone app. For example, wait until the cooking of a meal on the stove is over before charging the electric car. This will prevent your system having to draw from the grid. In other words, don’t use too many appliances all at the same time.– Bruce, Fawkner, VictoriaResilience in rural areasMake sure you get a system that will power your house during a blackout, and not find out later that you have to pay more for that function.– David, east Gippsland, VictoriaWe live in a rural area with occasional power cuts that can last more than a week after a flood. Only a few battery systems can accept power from solar panels when there is a power cut. Resilience is very important to us, and such a system does allow one to disconnect from the grid in the future … provided there is also the capability to accept a generator input during an extended period of cloud. Our system is six years old, and doesn’t have that capability. If we are off the grid in cloudy weather for an extended period, we would use gas for cooking and eek out our limited power.– Bunny, Darkwood, NSWIt’s more about security for me – we have had some big blackouts. But I enjoy playing with the app, working out which appliances use the most power, and shifting them to sunlight hours.– Anonymous, Coromandel Valley, South AustraliaExplore more on these topicsEnergyChange by degreesEnergy efficiencyRenewable energySolar powernewsShareReuse this content"

He will seek to pile pressure on the Russian president to “finally come to the table” and “stop the barbaric attacks on Ukraine” after Kyivagreed this weekto an immediate 30-day ceasefire.European nations, the EU Commission, Nato, Canada,Ukraine, Australia and New Zealand are expected to take part in the virtual meeting and provide updates on the aid they could provide towards enforcing a peace deal.It came asPutinpraised Donald Trump for “doing everything”to improve relations between Moscow and Washington, after Trump said the US has had “very good and productive discussions” with Putin in recent days.Putin told a meeting of his security heads that improved relations with the US were now on the agenda. “We know that the new administration headed by President Trump is doing everything to restore at least something of what was basically destroyed by the previous US administration,” he said.View image in fullscreenA soldier from the 93rd Separate Mechanised Brigade in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, 13 March 2025.Photograph: Ukraine’s 93rd Mechanised Brigade/EPAPutin also responded to an appeal by Trump to save the lives of “thousands” of surrounded Ukrainian soldiers, and said he would heed it as long as the soldiers surrendered. However, no evidence has emerged to back up Putin and Trump’s claims that there is a large-scale encirclement of Ukrainian troops, a claim explicitly denied by military officials in Kyiv.The exchange of warm words between Trump and Putin is likely to cause further alarm in Kyiv and European capitals, already spooked by signs of the new US administration cosying up to Moscow while exerting pressure on Ukraine.The remarks came after Steve Witkoff, Trump’s close ally and special envoy to the Middle East, held late-night talks with Putin on Thursday to discuss the US proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire in war on Ukraine.Kyiv has already accepted the proposal, while Putin on Thursday set out a series of sweeping conditions that would need to be met beforeRussiawould agree to the truce, which includes the condition that Ukraine should neither rearm nor mobilise during the 30-day truce.On Friday night, in speech at the Department of Justice, Trump said the US had had “good calls” with Ukraine and Russia during the day. “I think we’ve had some very good results,” he said. “Just before I came here I got some pretty good news.”He did not provide any details, but he later told reporters that he felt that “Russia is going to make a deal with us”.View image in fullscreenA destroyed building and damaged vehicle at a settlement recaptured by Russian forces in the Kursk region of Russia.Photograph: Russian Defense Ministry/Xinhua/Rex/ShutterstockDowning Street refused to set out precisely what goals the prime minister hoped to get from Saturday morning’s meeting, saying it was “a fast-moving situation” with a large number of countries involved.UK officials had expected to be able to release the full list of attenders in advance, but were seemingly prevented from doing so by the complexity of organising such a large event at speed. There were reports that the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, might not attend the meeting due to worries about the Anglo-French plans to try to guarantee a long-term peace deal.Starmer will be expected to set out to the assembled leaders details of a plan, spearheaded by him and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in the wake of Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s disastrous White House meeting with Trump two weeks ago. Starmer and Macron spoke one-to-one on Friday evening in advance of the summit, Downing Street said.In comments released by Downing Street before the summit, Starmer lambasted Putin over what he called “empty words and pointless conditions”.“We can’t allow President Putin to play games with President Trump’s deal,” Starmer said. “The Kremlin’s complete disregard for President Trump’s ceasefire proposal only serves to demonstrate that Putin is not serious about peace.“If Russia finally comes to the table, then we must be ready to monitor a ceasefire to ensure it is a serious, and enduring peace, if they don’t, then we need to strain every sinew to ramp up economic pressure on Russia to secure an end to this war.“Putin is trying to delay, saying there must be a painstaking study before a ceasefire can take place, but the world needs to see action, not a study or empty words and pointless conditions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Putin first made the claim earlier in the week when he said Ukrainian troops had been surrounded during a retreat from Russia’s Kursk region, and had the choice to “surrender or die”.Trump repeated Putin’s claim, writing that thousands of troops had been “completely surrounded” during the retreat. “I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!” he wrote.Putin told his security council that he had heard Trump’s appeal, and said the lives of Ukrainian troops would be spared if they surrendered. The Ukrainian military and independent analysts, however, denied there was an encirclement of troops.“Reports of the alleged ‘encirclement’ of Ukrainian units by the enemy in the Kursk region are false and fabricated by the Russians for political manipulation and to exert pressure on Ukraine and its partners,” the general staff wrote in a statement published on its media channels. “There is no threat of encirclement of our units.”Ukrainian security sources, independent military analysts and even pro-Russian Telegram channels disputed the encirclement claims by Putin and Trump.Despite apparent optimism from the White House, US intelligence services have reportedly assessed that Putin remains committed to achieving “his maximalist goal of dominating Ukraine”.The Washington Postreportedon Friday the contents of an intelligence report circulated among Trump administration policymakers on 6 March, which stated that Putin remained determined to maintain control over Kyiv.Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerVladimir PutinDonald TrumpEuropean UnionNatoRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The appointment to the finance ministry of the popular US-educated computer scientist Kyriakos Pierrakakis is also seen as injecting an air of regeneration into a government in its sixth year in office. Pierrakakis, 42, who moves from the education ministry, is from the centre-left.But commentators said with Mitsotakis confronting growing criticism from supporters of his own centre-right New Democracy party, the reshuffle was also aimed at solidifying his traditional conservative base.“It’s as much about reinforcing his control over his own parliamentary group and sending the message that from now on there’ll be a more conservative, hardline stance on migration,” said the European affairs analyst Yannis Koutsomitis. “It’s also a clear signal toEuropeand Washington that ‘we’re on the same wavelength’.”Once caught on camera wielding an axe as he chased leftist fellow students, Voridis, 60, emerged on the political scene as the head of the youth wing of Epen, the far-right party founded by the former dictator Georgios Papadopoulos. With a seat in the European parliament, the group enjoyed close ties with France’s late National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, openly espousing many of his extremist views.Voridishas long depicted Muslim immigrants as a threat to Europeand the social cohesion of Greece, a frontline EU member state that has seen successive waves of incoming asylum seekers over the past decade.On Friday the leftwing opposition Syriza party described the reshuffle as “an insult to Greek society”.The prominent anti-racist group Keerfa said the appointment of Voridis signalled a far-right turn, and predicted mass deportations at a time when New Democracy’s appeal had dwindled amid persistent claims that the government had “covered up” the train disaster. “[His] appointment shows that it will try to use racism and an opening to the far right to deal with the anger,” it said, arguing that with Donald Trump back in power the ruling party “saw opportunities” in adopting policies that would help pick up votes lost to parties on the far right.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With general elections not due until 2027, political analysts say there is still time to win back public confidence but few believe Friday’s changes will be enough to stem popular anger. “It is uncertain whether such changes would alter people’s perception of the government or make it more effective,” said the political analyst Costas Panagopoulos.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropeThe far rightMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

We make the best military equipment in the world.“But even with all of that, it’s unbelievable.

There was no encirclement,” one senior security official said on Thursday.Michael Kofman, a military analyst at Carnegie Endowment, described the claims of a mass encirclement as “fiction”.Some influential Russian pro-war military bloggers have cast doubt in recent days of the encirclement claims by Russian officials, saying none of the signs of such an action have been visible.View image in fullscreenRussian troops in the Kursk region.

Suffice it to say, I think there is reason to be cautiously optimistic,” Rubio said. “Obviously, we will see what Russia and others are willing to do. It’s not just Russia, obviously, it has to be acceptable to Ukraine.”Despite apparent optimism from the White House, US intelligence services have reportedly assessed that Putin remains committed to achieving “his maximalist goal of dominating Ukraine”.On Friday, the Washington Postcitedan intelligence report circulated among Trump administration policymakers on 6 March, which stated that Putin remains determined to maintain control over Kyiv.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, reiterated on Friday that Russian attempts to set up conditions for the 30-day ceasefire only “complicate and drag out the process”.“Russia is the only party that wants the war to continue and diplomacy to break down,” Zelenskyy said on X after a call with the secretary of state of the Holy See, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. “Putin will not end the war on his own. But the strength of America is enough to make it happen.”Zelenskyy emphasised Ukraine’s commitment to upholding the ceasefire, describing it as an opportunity to establish a lasting peace. “During the period of silence, we could prepare a reliable peace plan, put it on the table, discuss the details, and implement it. We are ready,” the Ukrainian president said.Explore more on these topicsRussiaVladimir PutinUkraineDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It was the first time a foreign army had occupied Russian land since the second world war.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin and army chief of staff Valery Gerasimov at a command post in Kursk on Wednesday.Photograph: Kremlin.ru/ReutersRussia, with the help of North Korean troops, has been pushing Ukrainian forces back, and in recent weeks the pressure on Ukrainian positions has become overwhelming. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin donned military fatigues to visit a command post in the region, and on Thursday, Russia announced it had regained full control of Sudzha.While Ukrainian troops continue to hold a few remaining villages in Kursk, soldiers involved in the operation said it was probably only a matter of time before the retreat was concluded.“The Russians are already pushing into Sumy region [in Ukraine], all the tasks now are defensive,” said Serhiy, a special operations commander who recently left the region.Map of Ukraine/Russia border zoneThe demand by Putin that troops create a “buffer zone” close to the border suggests a Russian offensive pushing back into Ukraine may be on the cards, and authorities have already evacuated several settlements close to the border.The end of the seven-month operation has led to mixed assessments in Ukraine, with some saying it achieved many of its goals, and others wondering if it was a distraction from the main war effort and cost Ukrainian lives for no tangible gain.“Kursk displaced the conflict on to Russian territory, and Russia used some of its best units to fight for it, but it also required a sizeable number of Ukraine’s elite units to hold the pocket,” said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Now, the Russian offensive may change the dynamic of the war again, at a moment when the US is pushing Moscow and Kyiv to sign a ceasefire agreement. “My worry is that this gives the Kremlin and the Russian army a new bout of enthusiasm and adrenaline,” the Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said.Theinitial incursion into Kurskhappened last August. It was planned by a very small circle to retain an element of surprise, and Kyiv did not even brief western allies until after the operation was under way. Troops arrived in nearby Sumy in small groups, and many stayed in rented apartments.View image in fullscreenUkrainian soldiers near the border with Russia at the beginning of the offensive.Photograph: Roman Pilipey/AFP/Getty ImagesDocuments recovered from Russian army positionsshowed that Moscow’s military planners had warned of the threat of an incursion for months, but when it came Ukrainian troops were able to overrun Russian positions, taking hundreds of prisoners of war.In Sudzha, officials and police fled without even destroying or taking away sensitive documents, leaving them for Ukrainian troops to seize and send to Kyiv for analysis.Those with knowledge of the planning say Ukrainian officials were taken aback by just how well the initial stage of the operation went, as Ukraine took control of about 500 sq miles within a few days.View image in fullscreenA destroyed Russian tank on a roadside near Sudzha in August 2024.Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/AP“At the beginning, the idea was just to create a diversion and to draw troops away from Donbas. But it went better than expected and suddenly we were digging in,” said one source.“We have no wish to occupy this territory,” Zelenskyy’s aide Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian in late August. “Our tasks are to push Russian artillery and other systems further away, destroy the warehouses and other military infrastructure that is there, and also to affect public opinion in Russia.”For the first time in the war, the shoe was on the other foot and Ukraine became an occupying power. The Ukrainian army took journalists on tours of Sudzha, where stunned residents could not believe the war they had seen on their television screens had arrived on Russian territory. A historian from Sumyrecorded a podcastin Sudzha’s small history museum, explaining how Sudzha and the rest of the region was historically Ukrainian land, a nod to Russian claims about Ukrainian territories.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The idea would have been to troll Russia, which masked its 2014 intervention in Donbas as the work of Ukrainian separatists. However, the plans were quickly discarded as unworkable and incendiary.The capture of hundreds of prisoners allowed Ukraine to offer an exchange for captured Ukrainians held in Russian jails, and the operation was also credited with providing a morale boost to Ukrainian troops and society after months of setbacks.View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian officer walking past cells holding Russian prisoners of war in August 2024.Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty ImagesThe longer Ukrainian troops held on to the land, the more it became clear that the endgame of the operation was now the chance to use Kursk as a card at future negotiations. Zelenskyytoldthe Guardian last month that Kyiv would “swap one territory for another”.However, as time went on, Russia upped the pressure on Ukrainian positions in the region. By the beginning of this year, Ukrainian military planners could see Russia making a sustained effort to concentrate forces on Kursk.View image in fullscreenRussian soldiers launch a BM-21 Grad rocket on the Kursk border in January 2025.Photograph: Russian Defence Ministry/EPA“Everything is going to Kursk,” one military source said in early February. “At the beginning they didn’t seem to pay that much attention to it, but then the North Koreans came, and then since the beginning of the year they are throwing everything at Kursk, perhaps to try to take it back before negotiating.”Some of Russia’s best drone units were relocated to the Kursk theatre. Because Ukrainian forces can use radio jammers to block Russian FPV (first person view) drones, Russia has increasingly begun using fibre optic drones, which unspool a thin cable over several miles and are immune to jammers.“The fields we are retreating through are like a spider’s web with all the fibre optic cables,” said Serhiy, the special operations commander.View image in fullscreenPeople queue outside a Red Cross tent in Sumy after a Russian drone attack in February.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesHe criticised the failure to build nets around the main road between Sumy and Sudzha to protect it from drones, as the Russians have done in part of the front in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. “Only in the last two weeks they started trying to do this, but now it’s too dangerous. They should have done it in September, October, when everything was calm,” he said.Ukrainian officials say that while ultimately the operation will not provide the hoped-for bargaining chip, it was able to change the narrative of the war, at a time when gloominess over Ukrainian prospects for any kind of advance had set in. They say that while the withdrawal may be fraught, it has so far passed without enormous loss of life or stubbornly holding on to undefendable positions.“After seven months, we simply withdrew. There was no encirclement,” said one senior security official, painting the operation as a success. “There were political goals, military goals, there was getting the Russians to move troops from Pokrovsk [in Donetsk] to Kursk. And we showed how shameful it is for the Russians, that they can’t fight Ukraine without North Koreans.”Others had a more mixed assessment, noting that the offensive stretched Ukraine’s already understaffed forces, and did not slow the Russian advance in the east. “Tactically it was successful, but the offensive changed little in the overall dynamic of this war, and failed to achieve its wider operational objectives,” Kofman said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The backing of the Green party, which would give Merz the necessary two-thirds majority for a constitutional change, is tantamount to him getting the deal through.An expanded group of far-right and far-left MPs in the new Bundestag could oppose the spending plan as a “blocking minority”, something Merz is keen to avoid.The Greens had previously criticised Merz’s funding proposals for being too vague, as well as lacking climate protection commitments.The controversial but ambitious plans put forward with Merz’s potential coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), are necessary, he says, for Germany to become independent of Washington in terms of its security and that ofEurope. The proposals envisage defence spending being exempt from the constitutionally protected debt brake when it exceeds 1% of GDP.The debt brake was introduced in 2009 after the global financial crisis, with the aim of limiting Germany’s borrowing capacity in order to protect future generations from the burden of excessive debt. But in recent years, especially after crises such as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the brake has increasingly been seen as an impediment and an obstacle to economic growth.In a debate during the first reading of the legislation in parliament on Thursday, Merz stressed the urgency of investing in security. Germany must “do something now … anything else would be irresponsible,” he said.He appeared to make concessions to the Greens, saying he would dedicate “up to €50bn” of the special fund to climate protection, as well as offering to expand the scope of defence spending to include civil defence and intelligence, asking: “What more do you actually want from us?”View image in fullscreenThe Social Democratic party co-chair, Lars Klingbeil, said the package would be ‘a powerful boost for Germany’.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPAThe Greens, part of the existing government but due to go into opposition, have been furious at the extent of the conservative bloc’s criticism of the party, blaming the Greens’ climate policies for Germany’s economic woes and ridiculing the party repeatedly in public.Markets reacted positively to the news on Friday, with the euro, German government bond yields and equities all rising on the back of reports that the much-anticipated deal had been reached.Analysts said it sent a signal that Germany was capable of decisiveness and raising its commitment to defence at a time of global uncertainty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not,” the office of Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and the US national security council said in a statement. “Hamas is well aware of the deadline, and should know that we will respond accordingly if that deadline passes,” it said, adding that Trump had already vowedHamaswould “pay a severe price” for not freeing hostages.A week agoTrump repeated a threat to destroy Hamasin a “last warning” to release the hostages, but it is unclear exactly to which of several potential deadlines the new statement referred.The US appears to have brushed aside an offer made earlier on Friday by the militant Islamist organisation to free Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American hostage who was abducted while serving as a soldier in theIsraelDefense Forces during Hamas’s surprise raid into Israel in October 2023, and the remains of four other Israeli-Americans who have died in captivity in Gaza.“Unfortunately, Hamas has chosen to respond by publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire,” the statement added.The reaction from the US dashed any hopes of sudden progress in continuing indirect negotiations in Qatar over the fragile ceasefire inGazabut will comes as a relief to the Israeli government.Theinitial phase of the ceasefirein the devastated territory came into effect in January but lapsed almost two weeks ago. In recent statements, Hamas has said it wants Israel to implement the second phase of the ceasefire, which was supposed to definitively end the conflict.Israel has so far refused to move to the second phase, and is calling for an extension of several weeks to the first phase instead, leaving open the possibility of a new offensive in the months to come.Witkoff has presented a “bridge” proposal in Qatar to extend the first phase of the truce to mid-April if Hamas releases living hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.“Hamas was told in no uncertain terms that this ‘bridge’ would have to be implemented soon – and that dual US-Israeli citizen Edan Alexander would have to be released immediately,” the statement said.After the Hamas statement, Netanyahu’s office said Israel had “accepted the Witkoff outline and showed flexibility”, but said “Hamas is refusing and will not budge from its positions”.“At the same time, it continues to use manipulation and psychological warfare – the reports about Hamas’s willingness to release American hostages are intended to sabotage the negotiations,” the prime minister’s office said.It added that Netanyahu would convene his ministerial team on Saturday night to receive a detailed report from the negotiation team and “decide on the next steps for the release of hostages”.Netanyahu has consistently opposed any permanent end to the war in Gaza, in part due to domestic political considerations. However, the Israeli leader has made it clear that maintaining good relations with the White House is a priority.After more than 16 months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas brokered by the US, Qatar and Egypt, Washingtonrecently opened a direct channel of talks with Hamaswith the aim of freeing US citizens abducted by the organisation during its raid into Israel.Hamas abducted 251 hostages during its attack and killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.In a social media post earlier this month, Donald Trump said there would be “hell to pay” if all the 58 hostages still in Gaza were not released. Fewer than half are thought to be still alive.In an attempt to pressure Hamas, Israel has cut off all supplies of goods to Gaza and on Sundaystopped any remaining electricity suppliesfrom Israel to the territory.Almost the entire population of Gaza was displaced by Israel’s military offensive, which killed 48,500 people, mostly civilians, and reduced swaths of the territory to rubble.The six-week first phase of the ceasefire led to the exchange of 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight others, in return for the release of about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. It also allowed much-needed food, shelter and medical assistance to re-enter Gaza.Official reaction from the Israeli government tothe news last week of direct talks between the US and Hamaswas limited to a single terse statement by the office of Netanyahu acknowledging the negotiations, but the mass-market newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said Israel had been “stunned to discover that, behind its back, Trump’s envoy had flirted for weeks in Doha” with a senior Hamas official.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesHamasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The standoff lasted until late on Wednesday, whenthe army said 33 hijackers had been killed.Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest and least populated province. Baloch residents have long accused the central government of discrimination – a charge Islamabad denies.The attack on the train has drawn international condemnation, including from the US, China, Turkey, Iran and the UK. On Friday, the members of the UN security council said it “condemned in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack”.The council said in a statement: “The members of the security council underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.”At a news conference in Islamabad on Friday, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmad Sharif said “in this terrorist incident in Balochistan, and others before, the main sponsor is your eastern neighbour,” referring toIndia.He offered no proof to support the accusation, which has been rejected by India. It was the first time the BLA – which has been fighting for independence and a greater share of the province’s resources – had hijacked a train, although it had attacked trains before.Some attackers had escaped and a search operation was under way to find them, Sharif said. He also said most of the fatalities were security forces protecting the passengers and troops travelling to their home cities.Sarfraz Bugti, the chief minister of Balochistan, told reporters that Pakistan has “solid evidence” of India’s involvement in attacks. He did not share any specific information.Sharif added that an Indian naval officer arrested in 2016 and convicted of espionage in Pakistan had worked for Indian intelligence to assist the Baloch separatists and other militant groups. The officer, identified as Kulbhushan Jadhav, has been sentenced to death. Sharif, however, did not link him directly to the latest train attack.Pakistan and India are nuclear-armed rivals with a history of bitter relations. They have fought four wars since they gained independence in 1947 from Britain.“We strongly reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan,” India’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, said.Earlier, Pakistan’s foreign ministry had claimed the train attack was orchestrated from Afghanistan, where the attackers had been in contact with handlers. Kabul denied the accusation and said the BLA had no presence there.Pakistan has suspended all train services to and from Balochistan since Tuesday’s attack. Sharif Ullah, a railway official, said repairs to the tracks, which were blown up to stop the train, had not started.Survivors have recounted their harrowing ordeal during the 36-hour hijacking.Muhammad Farooq, from Quetta, the largest city in Balochistan, described how the BLA stopped the train and ordered passengers to disembark.“They checked identity cards and started killing people who worked for the armed forces,” he said. Many passengers, he said, fled successfully while the hijackers were exchanging fire with Pakistani troops.Mohammad Tanveer, who was travelling from Quetta to the eastern city of Lahore, said he was wounded but managed to escape. He said the attackers had been looking for members of the military and security forces, and started killing them in small groups, one after another.Nair Husnain, a student, said he saw the militants go through the train, asking people to stand up and tying their hands before shooting them several times. They first killed soldiers, then minority Shias and Punjabis. Balochs were spared, he said.He also recounted how a woman travelling with her three sons – all soldiers – had to watch as they were shot and killed.“Those scenes are still before my eyes,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPakistanIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The family are being supported by specialist trained officers and our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time.”The vessel hit a US-flagged tanker, the Stena Immaculate, carrying jet fuel for the American military, which was anchored while waiting for space at a port in the Humber, having travelled from the Peloponnese region of Greece.The Solong was sailing from Grangemouth in Scotland to Rotterdam in the Netherlands at a speed of about 16 knots, equivalent to 18mph, when it collided with the tanker.Both vessels caught fire after several explosions and 36 crew were rescued, including Americans onboard the Stena Immaculate and members of the Russian and Filipino crew of the Solong.Earlier on Friday, the chief coastguard, Paddy O’Callaghan, said both vessels were “stable” and salvors had boarded them to continue damage assessments.He said: “There are now only small periodic pockets of fire on the Solong which are not causing undue concern.“Specialist tugs with firefighting capability remain at both vessels’ locations.“Regular aerial surveillance flights continue to monitor the vessels and confirm that there continues to be no cause for concern from pollution from either the Stena Immaculate or from the Solong.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

That is just not helpful for anybody.”In his speech setting out civil service changes this week, Starmer hit out at “a cottage industry of blockers and checkers”, while acknowledging that previous governments had set up the state in such a way.Starmer also used an intervention in the Daily Telegraph to hit out at the “overcautious, flabby state”, while stressing that “the problem isn’t our fantastic civil servants – it’s the system they’re stuck in”.Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, said the “low point” for Starmer had been his description of civil servants as bathing in a “tepid bath” of managed decline, which he later softened by assuring officials he valued their work.“The Musk approach is not something that government should want to go anywhere near associating with itself and I think whoever has been going around briefing about ‘'project chainsaw’ should be retired from the comms efforts,” she said.Rutter said tackling poor performance in Whitehall would be a good thing and civil servants would be pleased he was railing against the system rather than the quality of their work. But she said: “He could have had more substance behind the rhetoric and an action plan.”Civil service union leaders have also objected to the prime minister’s tone. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, said: “Blaming public servants for doing the job they were tasked with by ministers is just cheap politics and is increasingly following a pattern where the government appears more interested in headlines than leadership.”Starmer’s language has been praised by the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a thinktank that was closely associated with Liz Truss.Tom Clougherty, the executive director of the IEA, said: “Increasingly, the government is getting its rhetoric right. But its actions haven’t quite caught up. The British state is overloaded and that hurts both public services and the private sector. Changing structures might help, but ultimately government just needs to stop doing some things altogether.”Starmer’s shift to using more robust language has increased in his eight months as prime minister. He said he would “build, baby, build” to meet his pledge on more housing, channelling Trump’s mantra of “drill, baby, drill”.The prime minister also declared he would not tolerate building projects held up by excessive consideration for newts or bat tunnels, pledging to tackle environmental obstacles.While Starmer comes from the opposite side of the political spectrum to Trump, some in Downing Street have been struck by the sense of energy around attempted changes in the US – even if the aims are different.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, told LBC: “We’re different political traditions, but I think we’ve all been struck by the pace at which President Trump’s new administration has come in and made a whole bunch of changes to the way that Washington and the way that government works.“We might look at some of those changes and think, well, they’re not quite the changes we would make, from a centre-left perspective, but the speed at which they’ve operated, we’ve actually thought, you know what, we can go further and faster. We will, we are. That’s what the prime minister’s doing.”Asked about criticisms of Starmer’s language, the prime minister’s deputy spokesperson said he was focused on “an active, agile and productive state that works for working people”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He appears mainly to be referring to regulators and quangos telling ministers their plans are difficult to implement or problematic.‘The absurd spectacle of a £100m bat tunnel’The prime minister blamed bat tunnels for holding up planning processes, including HS2, as their protected nature means they often have to be considered before construction is approved. Angela Rayner has also said newts should not be considered more important than people, in the vein of Boris Johnson, who previously criticised “newt counting delays”.‘Flabby’ and ‘bloated’ civil serviceStarmer said the civil service had got too big and unwieldy, although he stresses that he is not interested in ideological arguments about its size. He is overseeing tens of thousands of job cuts among public officials.‘Build, baby, build’Last month, the prime minister used Trumpian language as he pledged to make it easier to construct mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales. Starmer told the BBC the government was going to “take on the blockers”.‘Smash the gangs’Starmer has long used forthright language to talk of his desire to stop people-smuggling across the Channel. The gangs do not appear to have been smashed yet, with 4,000 people arriving in small boats so far this year.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerCivil serviceLabourElon MuskDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The notice demanded access to Apple’s Advanced Data Protection (ADP) service, which heavily encrypts personal data stored remotely in its servers.Apple refused and has challenged the order at the tribunal, which investigates whether the domestic intelligence services have acted unlawfully.

Messaging services such as iMessage and FaceTime remain end-to-end encrypted by default.The government’s secret legal demand is officially known as a technical capability notice. Recipients of a TCN cannot reveal the existence of an order unless they are given permission from the home secretary. The tribunal’s website states that hearings should be closed to the public only when “strictly necessary”, but itsrulesdeclare there must be no disclosure of information that is “prejudicial to national security”.On Thursday, a group of Democratic and Republican lawmakers in the UScalled on the tribunalto “remove the cloak of secrecy” around the UK government’s order and to make Friday’s hearing, as well as any further proceedings, public.Bloomberg reported on Thursday that British officials had initiated talks with their US counterparts over the order. The UK has reportedly assured the US that it is not seeking blanket access and would only seek data related to serious crimes such as terrorism and child sexual abuse.The Home Office has been asked for comment.Explore more on these topicsAppleEncryptionPrivacyHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

ICBs, regional health service bodies which oversee groupings of NHS trusts, employ 25,000 people between them.Sir Jim Mackey, NHS England’s incoming new chief executive, has told the ICBs to cut their running costs by 50% by the end of the year. “Given ICBs employ 25,000 people, that means that half of them are going to go,” a senior NHS official said. That could lead to 12,500 posts being lost.In addition, Mackey has also ordered the 220 NHS trusts that provide care across England to cut the number of people working in corporate services, such as HR, finance and communications. That could lead to thousands more officials losing their jobs, insiders say.Mackey passed on the grim news to ICB and trust leaders in phone calls and meetings this week. He outlined the NHS’s need to undertake budget cuts on a huge scale as part of a “reset” of the service’s finances to help it avoid overspending by the £6.6bn in 2025-26 that initial estimates said was likely.Mackey, who is succeeding Amanda Pritchard on 1 April but already making key decisions about the NHS’s future, told service bosses that the prospect of such a massive deficit had “scared the living daylights” out of government ministers, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) reported.Senior figures running ICBs say the order to halve their running costs will make it impossible for them to undertake the full range of their activities, which include funding vaccination programmes, offering blood pressure checks and improving children’s dental health. ICBs have recently finished reducing their budgets by 20% as part of a previous round of cost-saving.“Operationally, this could be a disaster – 50% on top of what some ICBs have already done is huge. There will definitely be job losses,” said one ICB official.“In our ICB we have no more ‘fat’ to trim. It’s very difficult to see how, if implemented in a blanket way, this doesn’t lead to service cuts.”Julian Kelly, NHS England’s outgoing deputy chief executive, told the Commons public accounts committee on Thursday that ICB staff being cut by half was part of the wide-ranging reorganisation of NHS England that Keir Starmer andWes Streeting, the health secretary, unveiled on Thursday in an announcement that few insiders knew was coming.Kelly told the cross-party committee, which scrutinises government spending, that reducing NHS England’s staffing by 50% would save £400m a year and that if the staff budget for the 42 ICBs was subjected to a similarly brutal cut that would save a further £750m a year, once the programme of job losses was complete. He did not indicate how many posts could go.The sheer scale of budget cuts Mackey is pursuing is causing consternation across the NHS. One leader told the HSJ that the size and speed of the cut to ICB running costs was “terrifying” and would cause chaos for the service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the bigger issue is the 50% cut not only to central capacity but to systems [ICBs] and trust corporate services,” Taylor told the Guardian.“As well as leading to thousands of redundancies, the danger is that the scale of change and insecurity will distract organisations from the daunting task of achieving recovery and reform in the context of an unprecedented financial squeeze.”Matt Barrow, a national officer with the FDA union, which represents many DHSC staff, said: “Stopping duplication is one thing but a 50% cut to staffing following the merger of NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care goes way beyond that.“Ministers, of course, have the democratic right to determine the size of the state but you cannot make cuts of this scale without consequences. If you are cutting staff, there won’t be enough people to do the same amount of work and ministers will have to decide what they want to stop doing.”Explore more on these topicsHealth policyNHSEnglandWes StreetingLabourHealthPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

A settlement has now been reached with no admission of liability from the corporation. A three-week tribunal into the claims had been due to begin on Monday, but will now not take place.The four women, who all remain at the corporation, said in a statement: “We can confirm that we have reached a resolution with BBC management that avoids the need for a tribunal hearing in respect of our employment-related claims.“A protracted process lasting almost three years is now over. We’ve been deeply moved by the support we’ve received. We look forward to contributing further to the success of BBC News, especially to live programming and the growing streaming services that are so important to our audiences.”The legal case dates back to the summer of 2022, when the corporation announced it was merging its domestic and global news channels. It led to a recruitment process for five chief presenters. In witness statementsreleased last year, the women said some of them were demoted, while others faced a pay cut.They had argued that evidence from a whistleblower would show the BBC ran “a sham” recruitment process. They claimed that Jess Brammar, then the BBC’s editor of news channels, had “privately assured four other chief presenters – two men and two younger women – their jobs were safe, but admitted she couldn’t say much ‘for legal reasons’”.They claimed to have been victimised and to have suffered harassment, ill-health and reputational damage. All were off air for more than a year in the aftermath. The successful candidates for the presenting posts were Matthew Amroliwala, Christian Fraser, Yalda Hakim, Lucy Hockings and Maryam Moshiri. Hakim has since become the lead world news presenter for Sky News.The BBC has denied the women’s claims. It said all candidates involved in the process for the chief presenter roles underwent the same fair application process, involving an interview and practical assessments. It has said at least five other applicants recorded higher scores than the women during the “objective assessment”.The end of the case will be a relief to BBC bosses as they grapple with a series of running issues, including the start of BBC charter renewal talks, the departure of an influential executive and serious questions over itshandling of a Gaza documentary.Brammar is now an editorial executive in BBC content and works closely with Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s outgoing chief content officer. Moore, often regarded as the most influential woman in British television, recently announced her shock decision to leave the corporation.A BBC spokesperson said: “After careful consideration we have reached a resolution which brings to an end protracted legal proceedings with four members of staff and avoids further costs for the BBC. In doing so we have not accepted any liability or any of the arguments made against the BBC. We are simply bringing to a close all of the actions brought against us so that all involved can move forward.“The BBC successfully launched a single BBC News channel in 2023, bringing the best live and breaking news on TV and online both here and around the world. We welcome this opportunity to now look to the future, and to work together on delivering for our audiences – which is our first priority.”Explore more on these topicsBBCWomenGendernewsShareReuse this content"

That would put them on course for an undocking next week and a splashdown off theFloridacoast, weather permitting.The duo will be escorted back by astronauts who flew up on a rescue mission onSpaceXlast September alongside two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams on the return leg.Swollen eyeballs, baby-like skin, and the overview effect: how astronauts feel when they return to earthRead moreRocketing toward orbit from Nasa’s KennedySpaceCenter, the newest crew includes Nasa’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, both military pilots; and Japan’s Takuya Onishi and Russia’s Kirill Peskov, both former airline pilots. They will spend the next six months at the space station, considered the normal stint, after springing Wilmore and Williams free.As test pilots for Boeing’s new Starliner capsule, Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched from Cape Canaveral on 5 June. A series of helium leaks and thruster failures marred their trip to the space station, setting off months of investigation byNasaand Boeing on how best to proceed.Eventually ruling it unsafe, Nasa ordered Starliner to fly back empty last September and moved Wilmore and Williams to aSpaceXflight due back in February.Their return was further delayed when SpaceX’s brand new capsule needed extensive battery repairs before launching their replacements. To save a few weeks, SpaceX switched to a used capsule, moving up Wilmore and Williams’ homecoming to mid-March.Already capturing the world’s attention, their unexpectedly long mission took a political twist when Donald Trump and SpaceX’s Elon Muskvowed earlier this yearto accelerate the astronauts’ return and blamed the former administration for stalling it.Retired Navy captains who have lived at the space station before, Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly stressed that they support the decisions made by their Nasa bosses since last summer.“We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short,” Wilmore said, adding that he did not believe Nasa’s decision to keep them on the ISS had been affected by politics.“That’s what your nation’s human spaceflight program’s all about,” he said, “planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.”The two helped keep the station running – fixing a broken toilet, watering plants and conducting experiments – and even went out on a spacewalk together. With nine spacewalks, Williams set a new record for women: the most time spent spacewalking over a career.A last-minute hydraulics issue delayed Wednesday’s initial launch attempt. Concern arose over one of the two clamp arms on the Falcon rocket’s support structure that needs to tilt away right before liftoff. SpaceX later flushed out the arm’s hydraulics system, removing trapped air.The duo’s extended stay has been hardest, they said, on their families – Wilmore’s wife and two daughters, and Williams’ husband and mother. Besides reuniting with them, Wilmore, a church elder, is looking forward to getting back to face-to-face ministering and Williams can’t wait to walk her two Labrador retrievers.“We appreciate all the love and support from everybody,” Williams said in an interview earlier this week. “This mission has brought a little attention. There’s goods and bads to that. But I think the good part is more and more people have been interested in what we’re doing” with space exploration.Explore more on these topicsSpaceSpaceXNasaInternational Space StationFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

In a report filed that day, an officer said attempts to identify the owners of the damaged cars were unsuccessful and he had them towed “as they were filled with property, and I wanted to avoid further vandalism or thefts”.On 6 December, a month later, a yard worker at the tow lot noticed a “pungent smell” in the van and alerted authorities. Police and fire department officials found Cameroni De Adams “wedged under miscellaneous items in the vehicle’s middle row”, the medical examiner’s office said in its autopsy. Her body was decomposed, and authorities said her cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.The family’s claim asserts that she had “sustained severe but survivable blunt force injuries from the collision that required medical attention”, and that police left her “trapped inside of her vehicle without necessary care” and she could have been saved if officers had hospitalized her.“For my clients to have to live with the knowledge that their mom was towed away alive from the scene of a wreck only to die in a tow yard alone is incredibly difficult,” said John C Carpenter, the family’s attorney. “It would not have been difficult to see if there was somebody inside. It’s just basic common decency that you would check to see what’s inside a vehicle before you tow it away … They buried her alive in her car.”The case shines a harsh light on the dangers facing unhoused people sleeping in rough conditions in California, which in recent years has been home to roughlyhalf of all unsheltered peoplein the US living on the streets. More than6,000 peoplein the San Diego region werecountedliving in tents and vehicles and other makeshift structures last year.The news of Cameroni De Adams’s death comes the same week as a report in Vallejo, a Bay Area city, revealed howJames Edward Oakley, a 58-year-old unhoused man, wascrushed to deathduring a municipal trash cleanup last year.The claim filed by Cameroni De Adams’s children, the first step in litigation, calls for $50m in damages and accuses the city and its police officers of wrongful death, negligence, infliction of emotional distress and “tortious interference with human remains”.Cameroni De Adams’s family had sent her birthday wishes on 13 November, a week after the crash, and became alarmed when she didn’t respond and they couldn’t find her van, prompting them to file a missing person’s report the next day, according to the claim and autopsy report. Roughly a week later, authorities told the family her car had been located, but she was still missing, Carpenter said.The autopsy said the woman had been living in her van in the San Diego area for seven years, and Carpenter said he was not able to share more details about her life.“She was loved. She was an important part of their family. She mattered,” said the lawyer, adding that it seemed the officers at the collision scene assumed the vehicle belonged to an unhoused person and treated the car and its owner as “worthless”: “I can’t imagine a situation where an officer doesn’t look for a person inside a vehicle that’s involved in a wreck. The only thing I can think of is that our unhealthy prejudices against unhoused people made the police officer just not care about this vehicle as much as he should have. That’s a sad and dangerous thing.”Spokespeople for the police department and city attorney’s office declined to comment on pending litigation.Nearly500 unsheltered people diedin San Diego county last year, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune, including from overdoses, the most common cause, as well as from hypothermia and impacts from floods. Thirty unhoused people died when they were struck by vehicles and seven were killed by trains, the paper found.Older and elderly adultsincreasingly forced to live on the streetsin California are particularly vulnerable to health problems and violence. In May 2023, Annette Pershal, a 68-year-old unhoused San Diego woman waskilled when a teenager shot herwith a pellet gun at her camping spot. She was known to locals as “Granny Annie”, her daughtertelling the Guardian: “She was a person, not just a thing to be used for target practice. Her life mattered.”Explore more on these topicsSan DiegoCaliforniaHomelessnessWest CoastHousingSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

Tornado threats loomed for the Mississippi valley into the night and the deep south on Saturday.An approaching wildfire fueled by dry grasses and spread by strong winds prompted emergency officials to urge residents to evacuate Leedey,Oklahoma, a town of about 400 people. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma state patrol said on the social platform X that dusty winds toppled several tractor-trailers.“This is terrible out here,” Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48ft trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma, said of the high winds whipping up dust. “There’s a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I’m not pushing it over 55mph. I’m scared it will blow over if I do.”Forecasters said the severe storm threat would continue into the weekend with a high chance of tornadoes and damaging winds on Saturday inMississippiand Alabama. Heavy rain could bring flash flooding to some parts of the east coast on Sunday.Experts say it is not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.California atmospheric river threatens flooding in areas still reeling from firesRead more“What’s unique about this one is its large size and intensity,” said Bill Bunting of the weather service’s Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. “And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area.”The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn tornadoes and hail as large as baseballs on Friday. But the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with some gusts possibly reaching 100mph.A tornado watch was issued until 11pm for central and easternMissouri, including St Louis, as well as parts of Illinois and Arkansas.Forecasters said areas also at risk included parts of Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. About 47 million people faced an enhanced to moderate severe storm threat from Madison, Wisconsin, to Birmingham,Alabama.Forecasters grew increasingly worried that intense thunderstorms farther south would probably bring an even greater tornado threat on Saturday.The Storm Prediction Center said parts of Mississippi including Jackson and Hattiesburg and areas of Alabama including Birmingham and Tuscaloosa will be at a high risk of damaging winds and tornadoes. Severe storms and tornadoes are also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle.“We have a lot of confidence that we most likely will have a tornado outbreak tomorrow,” the Storm Prediction Center meteorologist Evan Bentley said in an online briefing on Friday.Wildfires in the southern plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds.A blaze in Roberts county,Texas, north-east of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 sq km) to an estimated 12.5 sq miles, the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X.The Oklahoma emergency management department activated its emergency operations center after several fast-moving fires that prompted evacuations of the town of Leedey in the western part of the state and in a rural area east of Norman.High winds also knocked out power to more than 210,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, according the websitepoweroutage.us.Meanwhile, the National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3-6in (7.5 to 15m) were expected, with up to a foot (30cm) possible.Winds gusting to 60mph into Saturday afternoon were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Combined with a light glaze of ice that could fall in some places before the temperature drops, travel conditions in the area could be treacherous that day, the weather service said.Thewinter blastcontinued after snowfall of up to 3ft blanketed the Sierra Nevada earlier in the week.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherExtreme weatherTexasOklahomaWildfiresUS wildfiresTornadoesnewsShareReuse this content"

The former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy called Zeldin’s announcement “the most disastrous day in EPA history”.The warning by McCarthy, who served under two Democratic administrations, was echoed by two former EPA heads who served under Republican presidents.Trump officials decimate climate protections and consider axeing key greenhouse gas findingRead moreZeldin’s comprehensive plan to undo decades-old regulations was nothing short of a “catastrophe” and “represents the abandonment of a long history” of EPA actions to protect the environment, said William K Reilly, who led the agency under President George HW Bush and played a key role in amending the Clean Air Act in 1990.“What this administration is doing is endangering all of our lives – ours, our children, our grandchildren,” added Christine Todd Whitman, who led the EPA under President George W Bush. “We all deserve to have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. If there’s an endangerment finding to be found anywhere, it should be found on this administration because what they’re doing is so contrary to what the Environmental Protection Agency is about.”Whitman was referring to one of the major actions Zeldin announced: to reconsider a scientific finding that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The agency’s 2009 finding has been the legal underpinning for most US action against climate change, including regulations for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources.Environmentalists and climate scientists call the endangerment finding a bedrock of US law and say any attempt to undo it will have little chance of success.Trump officials decimate climate protections and consider axeing key greenhouse gas findingRead moreWhitman and the other former agency heads said they were stunned that theTrump administrationwould even try to undo the finding and a host of other longtime agency rules. If approved, the rule changes could cause “severe harms” to the environment, public health and the economy, they said.“This EPA administrator now seems to be doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry more than complying with the mission of the EPA,” said McCarthy, who led the agency under President Barack Obama and was a top climate adviser to President Joe Biden.McCarthy and the other two retired leaders emphasized that environmental protection and economic prosperity were not mutually exclusive, saying strong regulations had enabled both a cleaner environment and a growing economy since the agency’s founding 55 years ago.An EPA spokesperson, Molly Vaseliou, said thatDonald Trump“advanced conservation and environmental stewardship while promoting economic growth for families across the country” in his first term “and will continue to do so this term”.Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, rolled back more than 100 environmental laws in his first term as president. He campaigned on a promise to “drill, baby, drill” and vowed to ease regulations on fossil fuel companies. In his current term, he has frozen funds for climate programs and other environmental spending, fired scientists working for the National Weather Service and cut federal support for renewable energy.Reilly said he feared that Zeldin and Trump, influenced by the billionaire Elon Musk and his government-cutting agency, would return to a pre-EPA era when industry was free to pollute virtually at will, filling the air in many cities with dangerous smog and rivers with industrial waste.Judge demands ‘some kind of evidence’ from Trump’s EPA to halt climate grantsRead more“I wonder if the malefactors are going to give us more burning rivers,” Reilly said. The comment was a reference to an infamous 1969 incident in which Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River caught fire, spurring passage of the federal Clean Water Act and creation of the EPA a year later during the administration of the Republican president Richard Nixon.The former EPA administrators published an op-ed in the New York Times last month warning of likely environmental harm as the Trump administration imposes funding freezes, cuts spending and fires more than a thousand employees. In a statement on Friday, they said the plan to undo environmental rules “sets the country on a course that will cause irreparable harm to Americans, businesses and environmental protection efforts nationwide”.Regulations are hard to make – intentionally so, McCarthy said. “They’re difficult. They take a lot of effort, which is why I think most of us are scratching our heads as to why we’d really want to keep rethinking what has fundamentally been working.”Zeldin, in announcing the rule changes, said, Trump officials “are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion and ushering in America’s Golden Age”.Among the changes are plans to rewrite a rule restricting air pollution from fossil-fuel-fired power plants and a separate measure restricting emissions from cars and trucks. Zeldin and the Republican president incorrectly label the car rule as an electric vehicle “mandate.″Biden’s Democratic administration had said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting the reliable, long-term supply of electricity that America needs. Biden, who made fighting climate change a top priority of his presidency, pledged that half of all new cars and trucks sold in the US will be zero-emission by 2030.The EPA also will take aim at rules restricting industrial pollution of mercury and other air toxins, soot pollution and a “good neighbor” rule intended to restrict smokestack emissions that burden downwind areas with smog. Zeldin also targeted a clean water law that provides federal protections for rivers, streams and wetlands.Environmentalists have vowed to fight the changes, which one group said would result in “the greatest increase in pollution in decades″ in the US.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS Environmental Protection AgencyPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

Nobody wants a trade war. But here we are and I can say one thing – we’re not going to roll over,” said Andrea Horwath, the mayor of Hamilton. “We’ve seen a powerful Team Canada approach across the country because at this moment, fracturing is not an option. Instead, we’re seeing Canada at its finest.”That unity has come in the form of a “buy Canada” movement, boycotts of leisure travel to the United States, cancellation of entertainment subscriptions and a rallying cry of “Elbows Up” – a reference to energetic tackles in ice hockey.At the Dofasco site, the relentless hum of machines, punctuated by the clang of passing trains provides the soundtrack to a city Horwath said had “steel in its veins”. Red trucks ferried batches of hot pressed coils, each weighing 20 tons, for shipment to buyers – many of which are south of the border.View image in fullscreenSteel workers work at the ArcelorMittal Dofasco steel plant in Hamilton.Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/ShutterstockCanada is the largest supplier of steel and aluminum to the US, exporting 10m tonnes and 3m tonnes of the metals respectively last year.“There’s really a lot of uncertainty,” said Vikas Jha, who works as a contractor in the steel industry. “There’s also a lot of talk, but no one really knows what do with that or how seriously to take it.”A previous round ofTrump tariffs, has tempered unease for some: in his first term, the president put a 25% tariff on raw Canadian steel and aluminum. Those levies persisted for a year, but companies like Dofasco felt minimal damage as steel prices soared.“Last time around, we were fine. The customers in the United States were still buying the steel because they had to continue to operate,” said Jha. “But this time round – we’re not entirely sure what’s going to happen. We’re not seeing panic. But if it’s a long-term thing? Then the mood is going to change pretty quickly.”In some sectors, the mood has already shifted. This time round, Trump’s tariffs on steel also apply to finished steel-products companies, including National Steel Car, Canada’s largest train car manufacturer, which has seen orders disappear since Trump was elected.“The fact that leaders are coming here means that industry has their ear,” said one Dofasco worker, Robert Meneguzzi. “Everybody understands the stakes and what’s going on. It’s more a question of what’s actually going on. All we’re seeing on the ground is confusion and uncertainty.”That sense of doubt has infected bilateral ties of all kinds, rendering unrecognizable a relationship long defined by stability and predictability.American officials announced that Canadians who visit the US for more than 30 dayswill be requiredto register with authorities and submit to fingerprinting – a provision from which Canadians were previously exempt. The shift is likely to affect the 900,000 Canadian “snowbird” senior citizens who annually drive south to spend their winter in warmer southern states.The United States has also paused negotiations on the Columbia River Treaty,a key water-sharing agreementbetween the two nations that expired in September.View image in fullscreenSteel workers leave a building at the ArcelorMittal Dofasco steel plant.Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/ShutterstockOn the Canadian side, government liquor stores have pulled American spirits and wines. While in British Columbia, the utility operator BC Hydro said it was excluding Tesla from its electric vehicle charger rebate program.The tariffs, framed by Trump as a move to restore “fairness” in global trade, threaten to inflict disproportionate pain in Canada’s industrial hubs.Hamilton’s steel industry has declined in recent decades – accounting for 30,000 jobs in the early 1980s but fewer than 10,000 today – but it remains a fixture of the city’s history and tax base.And the knock-on effect of job losses could be devastating, compounding the impact of that decline, said Horwath.“We’ve had companies already say that they’re laying off already, that orders have dried up. Others don’t know if they can weather the storm, because they don’t know how long the storm will last,” she said.“Hamilton is a city that makes things, and we have been for a very, very long time. What’s next and where is this all going? There’s a lot of tension, a lot of uncertainty and a lot of worry.”Chart show Canada steel exports to the USHorwath, who says as many as 42,000 jobs could be at risk in the region, recently met with company leaders who pledged to keep roots in the industrial city.“The commitment they showed to Hamilton, to Canada, and the fierceness by which they spoke about their intent to, you know, to hold on and to fight back and to rebuild was heartening,” she said. “Of course, there are limits depending on how things get.”On Thursday, Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, and the federal finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc, visited Washington to meet with Trump’s combative commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, in an effort to dial back tensions.“If you’re racing to the basement, there’s no real prize for the first person to get to the basement,” said LeBlanc before the visit.Horwath, who recently returned from the US capital after meeting with other mayors along the Great Lakes, said the ripple effects of a sustained fight would be “catastrophic” for Hamilton.“This isn’t theoretical. This is real. And I’m grateful for all the attention we’re getting from federal and provincial leaders because they reality is, we’re ground zero,” she said. “We’re an example of the bad things that happen if we don’t fight like hell.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasTrump tariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The assessment undertaken by USTR of potential actions to rectify unfair trade should also take into account exports from the United States.“For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported into those countries.”Trump has imposed significant tariffs that will affect vehicles and parts made around the world.The EU and Canada haveannounced large-scale retaliationsfor tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the US, while the UK has so far held off on announcing any countermeasures.Tesla’s share price has fallen by more than a third over the last month in an apparentbuyer backlash against Musk, who hasshown supportfor Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland party, theatrically brandished achainsawat a conservative conference, and accused the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, and other senior politicians ofcovering up a scandal over grooming gangs.This week Trump said he wasbuying a “brand new Tesla”and blamed “radical left lunatics” for “illegally” boycotting the EV company – a day after Tesla’s worst share price fall in almost five years.Tesla said: “As USTR continues to evaluate possible trade actions to rectify unfair trade practices, consideration should also be given to the timeline of implementation. US companies will benefit from a phased approach that enables them to prepare accordingly and ensure appropriate supply chain and compliance measures are taken.”Separately on Friday, the German carmakerBMWreported that net profits slumped more than a third last year, as the owner of Mini and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars warned of the potential impact of US trade tariffs.The company reported a 37% fall in net profits to €7.68bn (£6.4bn) in 2024, and expects an earnings margin for cars of 5% to 7% this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The BNPL market is projected to surpass $160bn by 2032, with retailers such as Walmart, Target and Amazon joining fintech firms such as Klarna, Affirm and Block to offer the service and attract younger, credit-averse shoppers.Klarna reported a profit of $21m, or 1 cent a share, in 2024, compared with a loss of $244m, or 69 cents a share, a year ago.Its CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, had considered a direct listing – a route that avoids selling new shares and the costs of a traditional IPO – in 2021. But the Sequoia Capital-backed company shelved the plan and instead raised funds at a sharply reduced $6.7bn valuation.The latest move comes as stock market volatility, driven by renewed recession fears and uncertainty over Donald Trump’s tariffs, threatens to stall a recovery in the IPO market.The company has partnered with major global brands, including cosmetics retailer Sephora, sporting goods giant Nike and rental booking platform Airbnb.It expects to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol KLAR.

Construction was another drag on the economy after poor winter weather held back housebuilders.Services increased by only 0.1%, with falls in hospitality and arts and entertainment making the biggest dent in growth.The ONS said gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to have grown by 0.2% in the three months to January 2025, compared with the three months to October 2024, as a result of the growth in the services sector.In Decemberthe economy expanded by 0.4%, helping the last quarter of the year to register a 0.1% rise and avoid two quarters of zero growth.UK GDP growth chartYael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said: “The UK economy starts the year on the back foot as global uncertainty casts a shadow on the outlook.”Reeves blamed global economic uncertainty for the downturn, adding that aplan to increase defence spendingwould give the economy a lift.She said: “The world has changed and across the globe we are feeling the consequences. That’s why we are going further and faster to protect our country, reform our public services and kickstart economic growth to deliver on our plan for change.“And why we are launching the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war.”Most business surveys have indicated that companies are putting a freeze on hiring workers and delaying investments to conserve funds. Business lobby groups have cited the upcoming steep rise in employer national insurance payments and an inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage in April for a fall in boardroom confidence levels.Government spending projects have faced delays while ministers review plans put forward under the previous Conservative government. The chancellor is expected to announce deep cuts in government welfare spending in the spring statement on 26 March to stay within the government’s budget rules.The shadow chancellor,Mel Stride, said: “It is no surprise that growth is down again, following near no growth in the last three months of 2024.”Stride said the budget last October had hit businesses’ confidence. “After consistently talking Britain down, raising taxes to record highs and crushing business with their extreme employment legislation, this government is a growth killer,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said he had expected a dip in January and still expected growth to return in the coming months.“Monthly GDP data can be noisy, and it was always likely that there would be some payback in January from December’s strong reading,” he said.“The launchpad from a strong expansion at the end of last year means we expect quarterly GDP growth to be around 0.3% in the first quarter, a step up on the pace seen in the second half of 2024.”Sterling, which has risen strongly over the past month as investors sold the dollar, edged down by 0.19% to $1.2921, but remained slightly higher against the US currency over the week.The probability of an interest rate cut at the Bank of England’s meeting next Thursday rose very slightly on Friday, but is still seen as very unlikely, with financial markets estimating the chance of a cut at just over 8%, compared with just below 7% on Thursday. Rates are expected to be kept on hold at 4.5% next week before a quarter-point cut in May.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) downgraded its forecast for growth the first quarter of 2025 from 0.4% to 0.3%, but kept its estimate much higher than the Bank’s, which has predicted growth will be limited to only 0.1%.Many economists said that after the lacklustre performance in the second half of 2024, growth remains fragile because of global and domestic uncertainty.Hailey Low, an economist at Niesr, said: “It is crucial that the upcoming spring statement provides stability rather than adding to domestic uncertainty. Frequent policy U-turns risk undermining business and investor confidence at a time when clarity and consistency are most needed.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)Rachel ReevesEconomicsBank of EnglandInterest ratesOffice for National StatisticsManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

People who can’t appreciate that are jealous’Giles Richardsin MelbourneDutchman says his job is not to please people as he sets out on road for a fifth consecutive F1 drivers title in MelbourneFri 14 Mar 2025 09.39 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 12.41 EDTShareOn the eve of what might be the hardest fought championship of his career, opening in Melbourne this weekend, one thing is clear.Max Verstappenwill not go gently into that night. The defending Formula One world champion, never one to shy away from speaking his mind, a compelling character trait reflected in his driving, is eyeballing the opposition and demanding they bring it on.The 27-year-old took his fourth consecutive F1 title last season, the toughest since his first, the titanic battle with Lewis Hamilton that ended controversiallyin Abu Dhabi, in 2021. In both, when the Dutchman was pushed to the limit, to scrap tooth and nail, he was uncompromising, an elbows-out battler, obdurate, driven by belief in himself and the righteousness of the Verstappen cause.Sun, fun and a favourite son: Melbourne makes a full-throttle return to the top of the F1 calendarRead moreOut of the car his generally easy-going persona belies this steel but it is there in the eyes and the conviction of his voice. As he leans back to consider his attitude to racing, to quote Rotten, J, he means it, man. “I do whatever is needed,” he says, with finality. “I try to always go for it when I think it’s right to do so.“It’s just how I am. I will always go for it when I think it’s possible, whatever other people call it. You might agree with it or not but I just battle the way I think I need to battle.”His acknowledgment that some diverge from his opinion is a concession to the debate sparked whenever Verstappen is feisty on the track. Depending on the viewpoint, he is a rare, exceptional, misunderstood genius and there are no shortage of fans who subscribe to this. Or ranging from reckless and even dangerous, as many concluded when heclashed with Hamilton at Monzataking them both out in 2021, to unsporting and contemptuous of rules, as his protagonist last season, McLaren’s Lando Norris, certainly believed when he was the victim ofaggressive attacking and defending in Mexico last year.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen will face an almighty scrap in the new season.Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/ReutersBut, well, whatever. Because Verstappen does not care. The criticism that such driving tarnishes his reputation is the gnawing of gnats on an elephant hide. “I don’t tell you or someone else how they should live their lives or what they should do in life,” he says. “Everyone should just focus on themselves. I think my behaviour is good. If someone else disagrees, that’s their problem. It’s not my problem, is it?”As F1 prepares for a 24-race season the issue is more pertinent than ever. He will probably face an almighty scrap, not least from Norris and his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, with Hamilton, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari and Mercedes all looking to join the party whileRed Bull, on the early form in Melbourne, have still to solve the problems that wrecked their car for the second half of last year.I will always go for it when I think it’s possible ... It’s just how I amYet Verstappen has beaten them all over the past four seasons and for two of those, 2022 and 2023, was imperious. His driving style was barely discussed because he was so quick, so consistent and so relentless.Success has come at a price, though. At the F175 launch event last month in London, to celebrate the sport’s 75th anniversary and open the new season,Verstappen was roundly booed. He has declined to enter into a debate on why the crowd reacted as it did. However, he was forthright on considering why some do not appreciate his achievements. “They’re just jealous. Jealous of success,” he says.“My dream was to get to F1 and be successful. I’ve achieved that and people that can’t appreciate that, they’re jealous. So that’s fine for them. But it’s not correct, because jealousy doesn’t bring you anywhere in life. I don’t do it for the people, I’m not there to please people that don’t appreciate me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You cannot look through F1’s history without finding greats who shared such iron-willed conviction, not least Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher.“You create your own success,” Verstappen says. “And I’ve created my own success with very important people around me. Of course, part of that success is with the team. All these people that I’m working with and that are close to me, they value that success. That’s what it’s about. And I am very happy with what I have achieved in this sport. That is the most important thing.”His honesty is striking and endearing. Verstappen, like Hamilton, is unafraid of putting himself out there just as he is, for all that such an unapologetic attitude could vex those who have taken against him.View image in fullscreen‘We have a very open relationship, we’re very straightforward,’ says Max Verstappen of the Red Bull team.Photograph: Joao Filipe/DPPI/ShutterstockLast year, when the team’s performance fell away mid‑season, he was unequivocal in his disapproval, describing his ride as an “undriveable monster” and demanding Red Bull remedy it forthwith. Very much part of a frank relationship he enjoys with the team. No one inside Red Bull has anything but positive words to say about Verstappen and a belief he is driven only by a desire for them all to succeed. During the travails of last season what was perceived as a clash between driver and team was part of this process.“My relationship with them didn’t change because we are always very honest with each other,” he says. “If I make a mistake it’s also said. We have a very open relationship, we’re very straightforward. So when it’s good it’s good, when it’s bad it’s bad. That’s how we approach it. That works the best if you want to perform at the highest level.”‘I have to perform’: Jack Doohan edges into F1 spotlight with fragile grip on driver’s seat | Jack SnapeRead moreIt is hard not to wonder if that level of honesty can be uncomfortable or even painful? “Not for me,” is Verstappen’s unsurprisingly blunt response. “It’s how I grew up. When things need to be said, they are said. Some people take that a bit more easy, it’s a personality thing but overall it is well received. We are all part of the process.”When Verstappen made his debut in F1 at 17, he was its youngest ever driver. There followed a steep learning curve, not all of it pretty and not all of it edifying, but pretty much impossible to ignore. A period that forged him such that he insists he would change nothing of those formative years. “It’s important that you make certain mistakes in life and some bits that hurt,” he says.“In terms of missing out on a result or making a mistake, it’s important to have that hunger to try to improve. If you know everything in advance, how to do it correctly, it’s very boring. You make some mistakes, it’s not nice at the time, but sometimes you need a hard lesson to become better.”Compelling as a man and driver, however you regard him, he enlivens the sport and his rivals go into 2025 knowing too well, given all those hard lessons learned, Verstappen will only go down fighting.

On Friday, the four-time All-Pro edge rusher had to stand in his own pocket and take the pressure of fielding questions about his decision to sign an extension with theCleveland Brownsinstead of trying to follow through on his trade request.“I think I had some frustration. And you know, I feel like that helped us grow and have conversations that were difficult, but needed to be had,” Garrett said. “I think the fans will see that my heart is in the right place. It has never been about money. It’s always been about winning. That’s where my frustration lies.”Garrett’s four-year contract extensionhas an average salary of $40mand makes him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.The deal ended a month-long saga that began during Super Bowl week when the 2023 AP Defensive Player of the Yearasked for a trade, saying he wanted to win a Super Bowl. The Browns were firm, however, that they would not entertain offers from other teams.Garrett said he believes the trade request and voicing his frustration about the Browns’ 3-14 campaign was the catalyst for changes in the team.“I had some frustration and I feel like that helped us grow and have conversations [with Browns general manager Andrew Berry] that were difficult but needed to be had and that created a little bit more discourse, helped build some relationships and reaffirmed them,” Garrett said. “Now I feel like we’re in a better place and now we can move on and grow from there.”NFL free agency winners and losers: Bucs’ smarts to questions for BengalsRead moreGarrett also said that team owner Jimmy Haslam largely staying out of the discussions allowed Garrett and Berry to have construtive talks. With an extension that includes $122.8m guaranteed and a total value of $204.8m, there is a prevailing opinion among Browns fans that Garrett’s decision ended up being about money rather than hopes of success. Garrett knows that is something he will have to disprove.“If it’s about the money then I can just pack it in and not go out there and give my best effort. But I plan to be the best person possible in this locker room, be the best leader possible and as well as dominating on Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays,” he said. “Giving everything for those kinds of wins and what I’ve done year in and year out, that really proves it to the fans. No amount of words will.”The Browns have only been to the playoffs twice since Garrett was the first overall pick in the 2017NFLdraft. He has 102.5 sacks in his career, including 14 in 2024.The extension means many will also expect Garrett to become more of a team leader as well as one of the Browns’ leading recruiters of free agents. Garrett was in the Browns complex on Thursday to meet quarterback Russell Wilson. The New York Giants are meeting with Wilson on Friday.Garrett said he brought up coming to the Browns with Wilson during the Pro Bowl.“I definitely think he’d be a valuable asset as a leader, as a mentor to those young guys. Veteran leadership can’t be understated and I think he definitely has some juice left at the position. He has plenty of arm left, he’s very smart and he knows what he’s capable of. So he’d be a valuable asset,” Garrett said.Explore more on these topicsNFLCleveland BrownsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Maybe if you squinted a bit, or just heard the vowel sounds. Perhaps if you’ve already performed some kind of ad hoc self-lobotomy using a chisel made from cheddar cheese, pork pie meat and fear. Maybe then, maybe then.But also perhaps not, because Thomas Tuchel’s first squad conference was in the event a highly convincing production, expertly phrased, and hitting just the right note of hope versus realism. So yeah. Good luck with that. How far can we go with this? Because as ever the dynamic remains the same, an appointment to this strange semi-sporting role that will tell us a great deal more about England than the latest smiling man in front of the boards covered in adverts.Jordan Henderson? Tuchel raises eyebrows as he gets to workRead moreThere were some notes of interest in the squad selection.Jordan Henderson you say? Finally, we’re ready to move on and take that final step. But mainly this was a fluent, quietly spiky reminder that this is just a matter of managing talent, that Tuchel is a supremely bright anglophile and a logical choice in many ways, if not in every way. And above all that he has a shot here at actually making this work.Best of all was the keynote, hit with reassuring certainty: it all felt very Premier League. Here is a well-briefed European man talking about football. This has to be the right way to go for the current 18-month mission. Modernise, internationalise. Represent the league English football has given the world, not the one it wishes it had.For now it was a fascinating process just taking in the new set of visual cues. After seven years of Southgate energy, after Lee Carsley’s enjoyably twinkly garden gnome in yoga pants act,here is a new thing, new toy, a new set of lines and sounds. What is it? Is it good? How can we ruin it?The first impressions were crisp and moreish. Tuchel is all jaw, cheekbones, boggly eyes, restless intelligence, sitting there in fitted black knitwear looking like a heroic wartime submariner explaining nuclear fusion to a room full of potentially tricky mid-ranking officers.He spoke really well. He dodged the obvious fault lines, and even got in some snappy passive‑aggressive comebacks. But then, for all the stuff about bloodlines, about inexplicably wanting to see his children in Germany sometimes, about the imaginary lineup of English coaches ready to fill the role, this is a good and measured appointment.Tuchel is the firstEnglandmanager to have worked in the league and won the European Cup. He’s more or less a continuity choice when it comes to the pathway DNA stuff, if only because that text was cobbled together out of pretty much all modern coaching methods. He brings some actual knowledge of how to win big games when the world is shouting at you.And yes, there is a subtext to all these early sessions. The England job drives people mad. First the ones around the edge. Eventually the person in the centre. How will Tuchel go insane? Which personal characteristic will be picked out and magnified by all that heat?Roy Hodgson ended up tieless and sleepless in Nice, muttering about logistics, blinking like some casino-lounge vampire. Gareth Southgate was steadily pared back, from garrulous wedding guest to parched and desiccated frontier preacher. Fabio Capello entered and left the job as a mute and angry waxwork.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel talked about emotions, values, love and building a brotherhood in his first serious engagement for England.Photograph: Josh Smith/PPAUK/ShutterstockHow will they go for Tuchel? Will it be the football? Too slow, too complex? Will it be going back to Germany on holiday? Long distance Tom. Tommy T’s day off. Loopy Tom the mad professor. Herr today gone tomorrow. Bad to Wurst. For you Tommy the World Cup is over.Or maybe none of these. Because Tuchel was pretty good in his first serious engagement. His word cloud was varied and engaging. He talked about emotions, values, love, building a brotherhood. He dismissed the captaincy question with a pfft (“It’s just Harry”).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can assure you that the talks in the last days and weeks had a parental vibe.” At which point one obvious point presents itself. Can we just clear it up. Tuchel’s English is more sophisticated than anything on show in the newspaper columns accusing him of not being able to speak the language.Wary and well-briefed, he skipped across some obvious traps. Yes, he was proud and honoured be the first German manager of England. He refused flat out to answer a question in German. Are you insane? He dropped in – casual flex – that he knows Prince William, banters with him about Aston Villa, and has been to Windsor Castle. Tuchel even looks like a surprisingly successful royal cousin, the ears, the hairline, the bones. Is this enough England?There was no mention of the ghost at the table, Sir Gareth, although there was something in Tuchel’s talk about style. We will play to the Premier league template, he insisted, an excellent response because this means nothing and everything. Maresca? Or Moyes? But it is right to speak about intensity and physicality. Who doesn’t like those? It is also probably a good point. If England had played like an assertive Premier League team in those finals they might have won one of them. This feels like something Tuchel may actually be able to add.Otherwise, the squad is good. Dan Burn is a populist choice. This is Tuchel’s independence for the Bank of England moment, his budget giveaways. And there will be a honeymoon period here, as news media and front pages cotton on to the fact that he’s eloquent, handsome and charming. Although this will have to happen in hyper‑quick mode because this is of course a win-things-now gambit.There is a slight paradox here. Is Tuchel really some kind of up‑and‑coming serial winner? For a while he had a reputation for almost winning things. The last time he managed a team for a whole season and won a meaningful trophy was five years ago at Paris Saint-Germain. He has also never been involved in a game of international football as coach or player. Is this going to work? Is there even any notion of what working is, given the general delusion over the level of English players, and the fact it seems only winning the World Cup will now be considered success?For now it seems likely Tuchel will start well, will capture some refreshing new energy, out there in his skinny-legged slacks, saying amusing things in press conferences. England will do quite well next year. But the home Euros in 2028 still feels a more realistic prospect.For now, here it is, coming around again, another voyage into the storm, another doomed love affair; underpinned this time by a different kind of competence, a different accent, and one or two odd notes in the weeks to come with the usual stuff about bombers and Great Escapes. For now, just get on the bus, Thomas. Don’t let them trip you up. And as we say around here, Good Luck.Explore more on these topicsThomas TuchelEnglandanalysisShareReuse this content"

The race began on 3 March in Fairbanks after a lack of snow forced changes to the route and starting point. That made the normally 1,000-mile race a 1,129 miles slog across theAlaskawilderness. Holmes finished in 10 days, 14 hours, 55 minutes, 41 seconds.“It’s hard to put into words, but it’s a magical feeling,” Holmes said shortly after crossing the finish line. “It’s not about this moment now. It’s about all those moments along the trail.”Holmes, who was competing for the eighth time, previously finished in the top 10 five times, including third last year and in 2022. In his first Iditarod, in 2018, his seventh-place finish earned him Rookie of the Year honors.Born and raised in Alabama, Holmes left the state at age 18 and worked as a carpenter in Montana for three years. He arrived in Alaska in 2004 and worked with dogs on a remote location of the Yukon River.“It’s been a truly amazing 10 days, and I soaked in every part of it – the lows, the highs, the in-betweens,” Holmes said. “I’m really proud of these dogs, and I love them. And they did it. They deserve all the credit.”Holmes now lives in Nenana, where he works as a carpenter and lives a subsistence lifestyle. From 2015 through 2023, he was a cast member of Life Below Zero, a National Geographic program that documents the struggles of Alaskans living in remote parts of the state.Besides the lack of snow north of the Alaska Range that forced the change of starting point to Fairbanks, race organizers also had to make changes to the ceremonial start in Anchorage. With snow trucked in to cover streets in the state’s largest city, the usual parade route there was shortened from 11 miles to under two miles and the number of dogs was also reduced.Only 33 mushers started in Fairbanks, tied with 2023 for the smallest field. The drop in participants has raised concerns about the viability of the race, which has had to contend with inflation, climate change and pressure from animal rights groups.One dog died in this year’s Iditarod: a pregnant dog on the team of musher Daniel Klein, who under race rules dropped out due to the death. Nearly one-third of the mushers did not finish the race.Explore more on these topicsIditarodAlaskaDogsExtreme sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But I know for sure I’m not going to win a Super Bowl there.”NFL free agency winners and losers: Bucs’ smarts to questions for BengalsRead moreESPN reported that other members of the Cowboys besides Parsons were upset at Lawrence’s comments.The Cowboys are themost valuable sports franchise in the worldbut have not reached the Super Bowl since their last title, at the end of the 1995 season.Lawrence, who agreed to a three-year deal with the Seahawks, was a second-round draft pick by Dallas in 2013 and signed the biggest contract for a defensive player in club history six years later after consecutive seasons with double-digit sacks. Lawrence failed to record more than 6.5 sacks in a season after signing the big contract, while the Cowboys made it to the divisional round of the playoffs four times in his 11 seasons. He said the Cowboys didn’t offer him a contract this offseason, although earlier this year he said he would like to stay in Dallas.“The ball is in their court,” he told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “I’m not only going to play in Dallas. I’m going to have other options, but I’d like to stay here. It would be a glorious thing.”The 32-year-old was limited to four games by a sprained foot in 2024 and missed at least half the season in two of the past four years.Parsons is the fourth player in NFL history to record at least 10 sacks in each of his first four seasons. The other three are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. With Parsons going into the final year of his rookie contract, the Cowboys could be on the verge of making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. Cleveland defensive end Myles Garrettjust took that titlewith an extension that averages $40m per season.Explore more on these topicsDallas CowboysNFLUS sportsSeattle SeahawksnewsShareReuse this content"

The first is a consistent sense of jeopardy from start to finish and the second isa level of entertainmentthat elevates the tournament into the mainstream consciousness. Whenboth occur simultaneously, as they have done this year, the championship’s final round ranks among the most gripping days in modern team sport.This particular “Super Saturday” certainly has all the necessary spicy ingredients, starting with the prospect of France’s second title since 2010 if they can beat Scotland in Paris. A bonus-point win for England over Wales in Cardiff, though, could yet be enough to sneak the trophy in the event of a breathless Scotland win. Which, from a Scottish perspective, looms as the ultimate catch-22 scenario.Ireland, too, are still just about in contention but will need to win well in Italy and hope both France and England subsequently underperform to nip in and claim a third consecutive title. With Wales also desperate to sidestep a 17th consecutive Test defeat and a second successiveSix Nationswooden spoon, there is even more of a “Judgment Day” feel to the triple-header of fixtures than normal.England must be ruthless against Wales – and that is the blueprint for the future | Ugo MonyeRead moreIf the evidence so far this year is any guide, not everything will go entirely to plan. France are now being hailed as the best thing since sliced croissants but didn’t they justlose to a previously hangdog Englandlast month? Shouldn’t Scotland have beaten England at Twickenham? Scotland’s record against France under Gregor Townsend is also pretty decent, with five wins in 12 meetings during his coaching tenure.And since when did the sight of a white jersey and a red rose not stir the blood in a pre-match Welsh dressing room? To be in Wales this week has also been to detect some fresh belief under their impressive interim coach Matt Sherratt. Even without Maro Itoje conducting his pre-game media address in the Roald Dahl suite at England’s Cardiff hotel the potential always exists for a few tales of the unexpected.On top of everything else the tournament is also about to see the creation of a record. A mere seven more tries will make the 2025 championship the highest-scoring in history, eclipsing the current record aggregate of 91 set in 2023. France, should they manage four tries against Scotland, will also beat England’s longstanding record of 29 tries in a single Six Nations tournament, set way back in 2001.That statistic alone marks this French side out as something special, such has been the improvement in defensive organisation over the past two decades. The new law requiring a drop-out from under the posts when teams are held up over the line also makes it harder for sides to grind their way to success. France, give or take their damp slip-up in London, have had to demonstrate both power and panache.Quick GuideRussell urges Scotland to end on a highShowFinn Russell challenged Scotland to add some sheen to their Six Nations campaign in Paris as he lamented the fact they have only a “disruptor” role to play in today’s three-way title shootout.With just home wins over Italy and Wales to their name, co-captain Russell believes a rare away victory over title-chasing France would go a long way to enhancing how their campaign is viewed.Russell, who missed all three of his conversion attempts, including a last-minute kick, in a one-point defeat to England, said: “If we get a win then we’d probably look back at one of my kicks that could have had us winning the title. I think the England game is probably the one that got away.“But if we can finish up with a win this weekend – the frustration for the England game would still be there, obviously – I think we could look back at this tournament as a decent enough tournament.“There’s probably a few folk questioning how the Scotland team is going, but if I hit that kick or one of the kicks, then it’s probably viewed very differently. At this level, it’s all about the results. But at the end of the tournament you can fully assess how it’s been and how you’ve played.”PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It should now be enough to secure them the crown, at least based on the evidence of their 73-24 dismissal of Italy and their subsequent 42-27 demolition of Ireland. If the youthful TGV that is Louis Bielle-Biarrey doesn’t get you – and he has already equalled the Six Nations individual try-scoring record – then the similarly rapid Damian Penaud probably will.Townsend, who used to play at Castres alongside the current Toulouse coach, Ugo Mola, has been suitably respectful in the buildup, suggesting their hosts’ performances in this Six Nations “have been the best I’ve seen from a French team”. That said, eight of Scotland’s 23 this weekend featured in the final rescheduled game of the 2021 championship when the visitors registered their first win in Paris since 1999 and the last two contests between the sides have been nip-and-tuck affairs.View image in fullscreenMatt Sherratt takes charge of Wales as interim coach for the last time before returning to his regular duties with Cardiff.Photograph: Nigel French/PAIt could become even more intriguing depending on afternoon events in Dublin and the subsequent tea-time narrative beneath the roof in Cardiff. Steve Borthwick’s England side have had a strange old campaign in some ways and the final instalment will dictate whether their season is remembered primarily for its blossoming promise or its mixed messages.England’s recent record on final weekends is also poor, with just three away wins – two of them in Rome – since 2003. In that time they have also famously had their travails in Cardiff, most notably in 2013 when Wales beat them 30-3. Remember that old line about even the grimmest of Welsh seasons being instantly salvaged by a win over England? It is suddenly back in circulation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Going into Saturday, France are +106, England +20, Ireland +13 and Scotland +2.Teams level on match points and points difference are separated by tries scored.

They could still win without a bonus point if France lose or draw without recording a try-scoring bonus point.If they lose or draw but record two bonus points if France and Ireland both lose and do not claim a bonus point.Ireland (14pts) will win the title …If they beat Italy with a bonus point and both France and England lose. A draw with a bonus point or a loss with two bonus points could be enough but they would need to to finish with a better points difference than France and England, who would also need to lose without a bonus point.Scotland (11pts) will win the title …If they beat France with a bonus point, deny Les Bleus a losing bonus, and overtake them on points difference, while the England and Ireland results to go their way.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There will be no divided loyalties, though, for Sherratt himself – “I’ve got so much familiarity with a lot of the Welsh players … I’m more interested in that than what country I was born in” – and he will be celebrating as hard as anyone. “I’m going back to Cardiff as head coach on Monday … if we beat England I’ll probably be in on Friday” – should the final day yield a Welsh win for the ages.In that event the likeable caretaker would be instantly hailed as a great redeemer and become a strong candidate to take over permanently but, while an attack coach role may yet materialise, he remains adamant he is not in the running for the head coach’s seat despite his squad’s upturn in mood.“My instinct is that it needs someone fresh to come in. I’ve [only] been a head coach for 18 months … I’ve always been pretty self-aware in terms of my development and I feel I need a bit more time in the saddle as a head coach at club level.”For those preparing to take the field for the final round this weekend, though, there is no time like the present.British & Irish Lions places are still up for grabs and so, too, are one or two coaching futures. The bookmakers rightly have France as odds-on favourites for the title with England at 8-1 and Ireland out at 20-1 but the most memorable Six Nations seasons always contain a twist in the tale.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025France rugby union teamEngland rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamWales rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamSix NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead he was watching a school production of Fantastic Mr Fox. His daughter Jadi, like her father on the pitch, had a starring role: she was Mrs Fox, while Wataru Endo’s son was a rat. It was the perfect antidote togoing out of the Champions Leagueon Tuesday to Paris Saint-Germain and waiting for Sunday’sCarabao Cup final against Newcastle.“I’m also a normal father, husband, man, and I like to do normal things,” Van Dijk says. “And when you’ve been seen as normal as well, and it’s difficult, but going to school is a nice thing. Some of the kids are looking up, thinking: ‘What are you doing here?’ The most important thing in life is my kids and my wife’s life. These things are definitely important, but they fully understand as well when it’s time to fully focus on the task ahead.”Virgil van Dijk has ‘no idea’ if he will still be a Liverpool player next seasonRead moreBefore the school trip, Van Dijk had gone through his recovery session in his pool with his son and his wife, Rike, and then had “a long nap because it was much needed”. The family will be back at Wembley. A year ago, they saw him score a disallowed goal before he headeda 118th-minute winner against Chelsea, allowing Van Dijk to lift his first trophy as Liverpool’s captain.Possessing perspective, something often lost in football, helped make Van Dijk Jürgen Klopp’s first choice to replace Jordan Henderson as captain in 2023. His leadership helped a team shorn of 11 injured players to grind out a victory against Chelsea. This year, three are absent, all right-backs, after Trent Alexander-Arnold joined Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez on the sidelines.“We were playing against a good Chelsea, conceding chances, but Caoimhín [Kelleher] had a fantastic game, youngsters are coming on,” Van Dijk says. “Jürgen leaving, me scoring [the disallowed goal] in the early stages of the game and then scoring the winner, it was a special evening.“There are so many good things that have happened in my time here and one day I will properly reflect on everything. But if I think about it now, it brings back so many good memories.”View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Virgil van Dijk scores the winning goal in extra time in the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea last season.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe 33-year-old is in Liverpool’s training ground with orange and ginger juice in one cup and a smoothie in the other. He leaves the choice of fruit to the blender-in-chief because he likes a surprise every day to break up his disciplined life. Van Dijk brushes off criticism from Wayne Rooney and awaits the inevitable questions about his contract, maintaining calm throughout.Arne Slot reiterated on Friday that he wanted Van Dijk to stay beyond this summer, when the centre-back’s deal expires, after the Netherlands international saidhe had “no idea”about his future. Liverpool’s manager turns to his compatriot for advice when required.Van Dijk says: “I love the fans, the fans love me, and I’ll keep working.

We’ll see what happens in the future.”Slot has used 27 players in theCarabao Cupand Van Dijk is at the centre of the squad, listening to concerns and offering encouragement when needed. “We work so hard, and especially in this cup,” Van Dijk says. “It’s always a collective thing, because so many players are part of all the games, in the journey towards a final. It’s just that motivation. I don’t need extra motivation to win things, but it’s helpful.”Van Dijk will almost certainly lift the Premier League come the end of the season, with Liverpool’s 15-point lead looking insurmountable, but hopes first to secure his ninth trophy with the club on Sunday. Whether he will get a shot at an 11th is to be determined but that does not weigh heavily on his mind.

A brace from Alessia Russo and own goal from Maren Mjelde gave the Gunners an important three points in the fight for a Champions League spot.Renée Slegers’ side are the quintessential puzzle of a football team. One minute, they can be one of the most eye-catching in the league; the next, utterly frustrating in their inability to break down their opposition.WSL clockwatch: Everton 1-3 Arsenal, Liverpool 3-1 Manchester United – as it happenedRead moreThere have been outbursts of discontent around the Gunners at various points this season. One such period culminated in the crescendo of noise that led to Jonas Eidevall’s departure back in October. Over the last week, the rumblings of dissatisfaction among the team’s passionate fanbase have reared up again after their side wasdumped unceremoniouslyout of the FA Cup by Liverpool at the quarter-final stage which leaves them fighting on just two fronts.One of those is the WSL in which they sat 11 points behind before kick-off on Friday, their chances of overhauling that slim at best. The other is a small matter of the Champions League, success in which has eluded an English side since Arsenal last won it in 2007.There is no doubt it has been a barren few years in terms of silverware for a club of Arsenal’s stature. Just two League Cups have come since their last league title in 2018-19 and they have not won the FA Cup in nine years. Their failure becomes even more stark when you look across to their London rivals, Chelsea, and compare the trophy haul that has come their way.It is a tough expectation for manager Slegers to meet. In her first six months in charge, the 36-year-old has no doubt improved Arsenal’s fortunes – the 11-game unbeaten run at the start of her tenure is testament to that. However, the long-term problems of being unable to break down a low block, a lack of depth in quality beyond the top 15 players, and her own place as a young developing manager all mean that slip-ups inevitably happen. There is also a feeling that she really needs a full transfer window to fully build a squad in her image, a fix that can not happen until the summer.View image in fullscreenEverton looked dangerous on the counter but Alessia Russo’s quality shone through for Arsenal.Photograph: Alex Burstow/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesThis mounting situation had turned Friday night’s game against a resurgent Everton into a must win. It was a fixture that could have been a stereotypical stumbling block. Since the winter break and the purchase of the club by the Friedkin Group, there has been a change of fortunes for Brian Sørensen’s side with money to bolster an injury-hit squad.Slegers opted for Arsenal’s older guard to try to bring stability back. Lia Wälti and Kim Little were paired in the middle with 23-year-old Kyra Cooney-Cross dropped to the bench.The first half saw the same old problems emerge for the visitors as they struggled to break down the opposition’s compact block. Tactically, they attempted different things to unlock the spaces – Leah Williamson was dropping into midfield and Katie McCabe was pushing high up at left back – but they found it hard going.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So often in her career, Little has produced the moment of magic and her visionary run in the buildup to Russo’s goal was emblematic of the quality she brings.Their delight did not last long, however, with Everton’s effectiveness on the transition causing consternation for Arsenal’s backline. The strength and pace of Kelly Gago to muscle Wälti off the ball and the quick-thinking of Toni Payne saw the hosts level the score just before the break.Arsenal were much improved in the second half, playing with a renewed intensity that kept their opponents on the back foot. Where she had failed to change things up against Liverpool the previous Sunday, Slegers was ready to use her substitutes, bringing on four players – Beth Mead, Stina Blackstenius, Caitlin Foord and Kyra Cooney-Cross in the 61st minute. The effect was instant with three of the four involved in the buildup to their second, a move that culminated in an unfortunate own goal for Mjelde.Arsenal were in control from that point, denied from making it more comfortable both by the woodwork and the brilliance of Courtney Brosnan. A second from Russo deep into injury ensured the Gunners travelled home with a vital three points. With Manchester United slipping up, 3-1 against Liverpool at Anfield, it was a result that saw them move up to second – the perfect end to a difficult week.Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's Super LeagueEverton WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The new England manager confirmed White “would love to be back in the squad” despite not being picked for the World Cup qualifiers against Latvia and Albania as he returns from a long spell out after knee surgery in November.Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson in Thomas Tuchel’s first England squadRead moreWhite’s decision to not play for Southgate has been heavily criticised, and the formerEnglandcaptain Stuart Pearce said on Friday that if players let you down once “they will always let you down”. Arteta would not divulge details of why White withdrew from England selection but insisted the right choice had been made at the time.“I was very involved in the moment that happened and I know how Ben felt and that was for me very, very clear the reason why he made that decision, how he was feeling about it and how he was struggling,” Arsenal’s manager said.Arteta strongly disputed that White did not care about playing for England. “It certainly wasn’t about that. It was about being the opposite, just facing the situation and saying: ‘I cannot handle it now and I am not the best person to represent the country the way I feel right now.’ So for me it was completely the opposite. I think not a lot of people would do it. What a lot of people would do is hide in that context, in that environment, and let time go and nobody talks about it. What he did in my opinion was very brave and not a lot of people would have done it.”Asked about Pearce’s comments, Arteta said: “From what I understand the reasons, it wasn’t about letting somebody down. He was just telling somebody: ‘I don’t want to let you down and this is the way I feel. I think it’s very difficult for me to give you what you need.’ So I think it was very different.“Whatever the outcome is what I want is Ben to be happy, that he feels fulfilled and he really feels his next decision. And knowing Ben, his decision is not going to be influenced by somebody else – he really needs to feel it. If they found that chemistry between Thomas and him that’s great. If he wants to come and Thomas wants him, great, because he has the level and certainly the potential in his career to achieve great things with the national team.”Arteta said Bukayo Saka was getting closer to making his return after hamstring surgery and would step up his recovery in training next week having been out since December. “He is going to be here, hopefully more with the ball at his feet than he has had,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His arrogance. The Champions Leaguehe won with City [against Interin 2023] is the only one where he didn’t try anything funny in the decisive matches. He has done a lot of harm to football. Because everyone spent 10 years trying to copy him. It ruined Italian football. A disaster and also a boredom that made many people flee from football.”Capello coached City’s manager during a short and unsuccessful spell at Roma after Guardiola joined them in the summer of 2002. The Italian selected him four times in Serie A and Guardiola later said: “I know the bench of the Stadio Olimpico better than the pitch.”City’s elimination last month by Real Madridin the Champions League playoff round was the first time since Guardiola’s tenure began in 2016 that they did not reach the last 16. The 54-year-old denied it was painful to have to watch this week’s games. “It doesn’t hurt,” Guardiola said. “I don’t have any disappointment. We don’t deserve to be there. This season we deserve to be on the sofa, with a glass of wine.“Hopefully next season we can do better and be on the pitch, not on the sofa.”Explore more on these topicsPep GuardiolaManchester CityFabio CapelloChampions LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

It will kick off a series of global “grand slam” events that is expected to run beyond this year.The independently run competition, funded by private US-based investment, has a prize pot believed to extend to a significant seven-figure sum that may rival the money on offer for the Women’s Champions League finalists.Tough love and team bonding: Bompastor’s seamless Chelsea transitionRead moreThe eight teams involved are not confirmed but the Guardian understands at least two Women’s Super League teams could take part in the first competition, staged across three days in the buildup to the final, which takes place in Lisbon on 24 May. Angel City are believed to be one of two likely representatives from the US and Bayern Munich are among a contingent of elite European clubs keen on participating. A final roll call may not be decided until the Champions League finalists have been determined.It is a pioneering development for a sport that has sought new ways to widen its audience and raise income. The tournament, with a number of experienced women’s football executives involved in its creation, will not take place under Uefa’s auspices even though it effectively occurs on the turf of its flagship event. Uefa and Fifa have been involved in dialogue with the organisers, who are understood not to regard themselves as ­competitors to traditional governing bodies.The pair that face off at the Estádio José Alvalade on 24 May are highly unlikely to be among those contesting the seven-a-side event, in which teams will be expected to field their A-list stars. It is believed participants will prioritise the new tournament ahead of any domestic commitments that may clash.International coaches may balk at the prospect of leading players taking on another commitment six weeks before Euro 2025. The competition will allow roll-on, roll-off substitutes, with teams bringing squads of 14, and the expectation is that few players would complete more than 90 minutes of competitive action over the three days.Games will consist of 15-minute halves; the teams will be split into round-robin groups of four, feeding into semi-finals and a final. A “players’ council” is understood to have been formed to ensure players have a strong say on the playing environment. A sequel to the Portugal launch event will be held later in 2025.The rewards on offer may soften the blow for those who have missed out on continental glory. This ­season’s Champions League winners will win up to €1.4m (£1.2m), which will rise to up to €1.995m from next season. The seven-a-side venture will feature a multimillion-pound prize fund that, according to sources, will be split between clubs and players. It will be a significant figure relative to the sums typically on offer in the women’s game, where for example the winners ofthis season’s FA Cupfinal will receive £430,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Owing to the fact the women’s game has never had an official, global women’s club competition, meetings between US and European giants are rare outside of friendlies.Uefa, asked by the Guardian whether it endorsed the tournament, kept a clear distance. “All Uefa finals may attract the interest of private organisers trying to stage unofficial events during the same period,” a statement said. “Uefa does not intend to be involved in any capacity in such events. Seven-a-side is not a codified format of football.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballWomen's Champions LeagueUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Scores are then averaged out according to the number of teams from a given country that started the season in Europe.Thecoefficient tablehas England scoring the most points this season, ahead of Spain and Italy. With the top two nations earning the EPS, in effect England must stay clear of Italy to confirm a spot. England have five teams left in competition. Italy have fallen to three, with Inter, Lazio and Fiorentina progressing.View image in fullscreenReece James and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (centre) of Chelsea. Their progress in Europe is helping English clubs’ push for a fifth Champions League place.Photograph: Henning Von Jagow/Action Plus/ShutterstockRoma’s defeat by Athletic Club could prove crucial because not only will Italy have fewer clubs to earn points, any that are accumulated will still be divided by eight for the purposes of the coefficient. This is the case because Italy won an EPS slot for the Champions League last year. Only seven English teams started the season in Europe, meaning each point they score from here on in will count for more.If Manchester Unitedor Spurswin the Europa League they would also enter the Champions League in 2025-26. This would mean six English teams in the Champions League, a first for any country in the competition. It would also likely mean any coefficient points would be divided by nine next season, making repeating the feat in 2026 that little bit harder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All started and performed well against Real Sociedad and Fernandes was asked about the billionaire’s comments.“It’s not nice to hear certain things obviously,” he said. “I don’t think any player likes to hear criticism or things that are talked about; that you’re not good enough or you’re overpaid or whatever. Everyone has their own contract. The club agrees to the contracts at the time you come here, or at the time you do a new contract, and it’s about proving that you can be important for the club.“We can’t relax at this club. There’s a big standard, a big attention that you get from the media. You need to realise that sometimes you need to put your focus on your game, trying to improve yourself.”In August, when Erik ten Hag was still manager, Fernandes signed a new deal until 2027 with the option of a further year. He revealed this came after he had considered leaving. “I sat with the club because I had an offer to leave, we talked about the possibility of me leaving the club or staying,” the 30-year-old said. “They said what they wanted from me. I asked if they still see me as part of the future of the club or not. I spoke at the time with Ten Hag also.“He was very clear with me, the club were very clear with me; that they thought I would be a big part of this rebuild that they want to do in a different way. I heard what they had to tell me. I thought that we could be successful. Unfortunately, we didn’t start the season very well. Erik had to lose his job by the results we had and the performance we had, but the fault was on everyone and everyone together with the manager.“Now we are in a different moment with a new manager that thinks in a different way, has a different way of playing. I’m still very happy at the club.”Last month the former United captain Roy Keane criticised Fernandes’s leadership, saying on the Overlap podcast: “Bruno is not a fighter.” The Portuguese denied this was unfair.“Everyone has an opinion and that’s fine,” he said. “I can’t change the mind of people. Roy Keane was an amazing captain for the club, one of the best. He’s massively respected and has all my respect. He has to give his opinion in a programme and this is what he thinks about me. What I’m doing on the pitch is to try to change his mind, or do something he probably sees as a good thing. Obviously I do it in my own way, I don’t want to copy anyone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I try to help everyone in the best way I know. I have a lot of things to improve, not only as a captain but as a player, as a person, as a human being and that’s fine.“Criticism is going to be always there and it’s going to make me grow and understand that there’s still a long way to go.”Amorim said his team were starting to comprehend his vision. “I feel that in the last games that we understand the idea of what we want to do better,” he said. “We are better at understanding the plan for the games, we are giving more time for the team to win or draw games – not conceding a goal and losing our minds and suffering another goal. We are understanding the moments of the game and also we are understanding better the way we want to play.”Mason Mount may be a substitute at Leicester after 19 games out with an undisclosed injury. “I really love Mason Mount,” Amorim said. “When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club. I think he will be on the bench – we will see. He cannot play too many minutes but just five minutes of Mason Mount is perfect.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedJim RatcliffeEuropa LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Maddison was instrumental in the move that created Wilson Odobert’s winning goal, having earlier scored his 11th of the season to make it 2-0.Wilson Odobert double takes Tottenham past AZ to keep season aliveRead moreIt meant Tottenham, who had not reached the last eight of the Europa League since 2013, have an opportunity to win a first trophy since 2008 and Maddison said they can go all the way. “It would be naive to say no. I could give you a cliche answer and say we’re focused on the next game, but it has to be there, there has to be that drive.“The quarter-final is the next stage and we’ll focus on that, but the gaffer always talks about having a special season and this is one way we can have a special season. There are lots of good teams in it, but we’re a good team, so the belief is definitely there.”Maddison was not called up by Thomas Tuchel forhis first England squadbut Dominic Solanke was included and he provided the assists for Odobert’s first Spurs goals. The Frenchman’s tie-clinching goal capped a flowing move when all but two Spurs players touched the ball and Maddison revealed they had been working on this kind of move.“Credit to the gaffer and the coaches, we work on the overlaps and the winger being in at the back stick,” he said. “How many times have you see Brennan Johnson score that goal at the back stick and today it was Wilson.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurEuropa LeagueAZ AlkmaarnewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up now!Michael ButlerFri 14 Mar 2025 13.25 EDTFirst published on Fri 14 Mar 2025 12.51 EDTShareSPILL THE TThomas Tuchel was unveiled as England managerin mid-October. Since then, he spent two-and-a-half months unofficially collecting his thoughts (and sizeable wage) during a pre-job gardening leave before officially starting on 1 January. Since then, Tuchel has spent the last two-and-a-half months making “an absolutely brilliant impact” and “building connections”, according to chief FA suit Mark Bullingham, despite Tuchel spending large stints working remotely in Germany. Fear not, though, Tuchel has spentsometime in England, mainly in chauffeured vehicles and Premier League hospitality lounges. Sitting in heated seats a couple of times a week is rough work, but someone has to do it. It is sometimes said that the England manager’s job is the hardest in football. Just don’t tell that to the person cleaning the post-match bogs at your local Sunday League side.Seemingly the only tangible thing that Tuchel has been required to produce in those months is a list of 26 male names for England’s upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Albania (65th in the Fifa rankings) and Latvia (140th), two giants of the modern game. And after whittling down an initial longlist of 55 names,said list was published on Fridayto a … mixed reception.There was plenty to digest. The naming offournaangoalkeeperswas certainly a bold look, Marcus Rashford was back in, while the inclusion of Dominic Solanke, recently recovered from knack, over Bigger Cup quarter-finalist Ollie Watkins left more eyebrows raised than a Carlo Ancelotti lookalike convention. Dropping Harry Maguire and including another giant centre-back in the uncapped Dan Burn to head and kick the ball away from England’s goal is exactly the sort of tactical innovation that Tuchel has made a career out of. And although the German should be praised for calling up Arsenal’s Myles Lewis-Skelly, anyone with a pair of eyes and access to Luke Shaw’s medical records could probably have made that call, too.Arguably the most surprising name on the sheet is Jordan Henderson. The talented yet ageing midfielder – who will turn 36 during the 2026 World Cup – has earned an unlikely recall despite a rocky last couple of years, includingcontroversial moves to Saudi Arabiaand Ajax. “I think his career and the way [Henderson] plays now and imposes himself at Ajax is just so impressive,” justified Tuchel, seemingly unaware that Henderson missed Ajax’s Bigger Vase last-16 second-leg defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday through suspension after dissent towards Italian referee Simone Sozza in the first leg – a dismissive gesture later described as “very stupid” by Henderson himself.“Jordan builds on character, personality and energy that he brings to the team,” continued Tuchel, undeterred. “For me, Jordan is a similar call-up for the same reasons as Dan Burn. They carry these values on their shoulders and they carry their teams,” continued the German, seemingly unaware that Henderson is not even a starter these days for Ajax, named on the Dutch club’s substitute bench for each of the last three league matches.

I’m a fighter. I didn’t have a playing career, so I’ve had to scrap to get where I am. I’ve been through a huge amount, so it’s made me quite tough. And it was two-way, right? What the fans did was incredible. It was important for me to show them my appreciation and the way I can do that is being on the touchline driving their club. It was my way of giving back a little bit. I know there were a few reservations from a few people: ‘Is it too early?’ But it just felt right” – the Bristol City manager, Liam Manning,talks to Ben Fisher about returning to footballafter the death of his baby son, Theo, last year.View image in fullscreenLiam Manning.Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSI’m sorry for disagreeing with an octogenarian (Guy Robert,yesterday’s letters) whose knowledge I would otherwise bow [to], but a penalty miss is a miss whether saved or not. By the way, I’m only 50 and reading the Football Daily is a highlight of my day. Is this (arguing with my elders and betters) as good as it’s going to get for the next 30 years? Probably” – Andy Morrison.Since pedantry is suddenly in fashion again: Thursday’s Football Daily referred to ‘an agonising afternoon’ for Villa as they lost at home to Ipswich in 1981. Not so: it was actually an evening game” – Glyn Berrington (and others).I like Thomas Tuchel primarily because he was involved in that wonderful handshake spat with Antonio Conte while he was the manager of Chelsea. But I can’t look at him without thinking how much he resembles the figure in Edvard Munch’s ‘The Scream’. And judging by the response to his appointment from the unhinged wings of the British press, I have a feeling Munch’s masterpiece is a premonition of the pressure he’s signed up for” – Colin Reed.Send letters tothe.boss@theguardian.com.

Carsley, born in England and of Irish heritage, chose not to sing the anthem.Jordan Henderson? Tuchel gets to work with an eyebrow-raising England squadRead moreTuchel, the first German to manageEngland, gave a characteristically considered response to the question of the anthem, which he hoped was heavy on respect.“First of all, you have a very powerful, emotional and meaningful national anthem and I could not be more proud to be on the sideline and be in charge of the English national team,” Tuchel said. “It means everything. But I can feel because it is that meaningful and it is that emotional and it is so powerful that I have to earn my right to sing it. I feel that it is not just a given. You cannot just sing it. That’s why I decided that I will not sing it in my first matches.“I will earn the right with results, with building a group, with doing my job properly and by creating a feeling where maybe even you guys [in the media] say at some point: ‘Now it’s time that you sing it. It feels like you properly earn it and you’re a proper English guy now!’“Maybe I have to dive more into the culture and earn my right from you, from the players, from the supporters, so everyone feels like: ‘He should sing it now, he’s one of our own; he’s the English manager, he should sing it.’”Tuchel was asked whether he had learned the words. “Yeah,” he replied. “It’s not hard.”Tuchel said he had attended 25 club matches featuring England players since starting in the job on 1 January and, when he was not at a live weekend fixture, he could watch even more games on special screens that offer the full tactical picture. Tuchel is based in London and travels home to Munich to see his children.“On the Premier League weekends where I don’t go, I watch a minimum of five matches live on a wide-angle screen,” he said. “I watch more if you don’t see me than if you see me in the stadium because if I go to the stadium on a Saturday, I don’t see the matches before and after.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Henderson’s involvement has effectively squeezed out Conor Gallagher, Angel Gomes and Adam Wharton. There was no room for Jack Grealish and Ben White, although Tuchel said the latter was open to an international return after his self-imposed exile.Rashford endured a frustrating 18-month period at United, his form nose-diving and prompting him last month to go on loan to Villa, where he has shown flashes of his old self. Tuchel offered insight into his man-management when he said he could easily have waited before calling up Rashford, maybe until the June international break, and the player would have been fine with it. But that would have been to miss the opportunity to boost him now.“I had the feeling that we need to reward him now, we need to feel him, he needs to be close to me, that he does not fall back into old routines,” Tuchel said. “He stepped up his game impressively [at Villa] against the ball. This is the most important point for him – the intensity after ball loss. The tracking back on the side. The sprinting. The hunting down. Making sure you’re in position.Quick GuideEngland squadShowGoalkeepers:Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), Jordan Pickford (Everton), Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton), James Trafford (Burnley).Defenders:Dan Burn (Newcastle United), Levi Colwill (Chelsea), Marc Guéhi (Crystal Palace), Reece James (Chelsea), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal), Tino Livramento (Newcastle United), Jarell Quansah (Liverpool), Kyle Walker (Milan, on loan from Manchester City).Midfielders:Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace), Jordan Henderson (Ajax), Curtis Jones (Liverpool), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), Declan Rice (Arsenal), Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa).Forward:Jarrod Bowen (West Ham United), Phil Foden (Manchester City), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle United), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Marcus Rashford (Aston Villa, on loan from Manchester United), Dominic Solanke (Tottenham Hotspur).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“That he can bully defenders, we know all that … we forgot a little bit about it but we know it. He is a ­complete package. But at the same time, we want to make sure that he stays on track.”Rashford won his most recent cap, his 60th, last March and Henderson has not played for England since November 2023. The midfielder took the ill-fated decision to go to Saudi Arabia in the summer of that year and although he moved to Ajax in January 2024, he found himself on the outside looking in when it came to England.Tuchel is convinced Henderson can still perform at the age of 34, saying he does not “see a slower version or an older version of him”. Moreover, there are Henderson’s leadership skills, his ability to help the talent around him grow.“I’m not so sure we need 23 outfield players in the World Cup and every one of these players needs to have the intention to be a starter,” Tuchel said. “Once we go to the World Cup we need to identify clearly the roles. We will have a core team who are eager to be starters. We will have a support team, as well. We will have a team who is happy to end matches for us. We will have a group of players who are happy to take care of the values of the team, of the language, of the laughter, the pressure, the intensity, the seriousness.”Tuchel was asked whether he was aware that Henderson had missed the second leg of Ajax’s Europa League exit against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday after being booked in the first leg for swearing at the referee. “I was not aware of that … I thought only Jude [Bellingham] is doing that,” he replied, referring to Bellingham’s red card in Real Madrid’s draw against Osasuna in February.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With Ollie Watkins nursing a knee problem and needing to sit it out, Tuchel simply preferred Dominic Solanke to Toney. Also injured are, among others, Trent Alexander-Arnold, John Stones, Harry Maguire, Lewis Hall, Luke Shaw, Kobbie Mainoo, Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke.Tuchel spoke about how he wanted to build a spirit of “brotherhood” in the squad and his determination not to copy the leading nation of the moment but to play with a distinctive Premier League style.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel at the press conference following the announcement of his first England squad.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters“We should be proud enough of the culture and style of English football and the English league to implement this style,” he said. “We have to increase the intensity in our games, the rhythm. I want to have more touches in the opponents’ box. I want to have more ball recoveries in the opponents’ half. I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t play a high press in the next matches. It’s our job to make it quickly understandable and still give the players the freedom to express themselves.”On Grealish, who has been in and out of the Manchester City team and in the headlines for his off-the-field behaviour, Tuchel said: “I love Jack. I love everything about him. But lately, he simply has no rhythm. He and I agree 100% with this. He said: ‘Listen Thomas, I’m not a start-stop player. It is so hard for me to influence a match from the bench and then be on the bench again and then two weeks later I start again.’ It’s just a characteristic of Jack. The more he plays the better he gets and then he becomes a proper machine.“It’s not ideal that he’s in the newspapers and out there in public. We want to have him more calm. No one wants to have this. But this was not the reason for not picking him.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelMarcus RashfordnewsShareReuse this content"

Within a month, though, there could be two, if McManus and Gavin Cromwell, Inothewayurthinkin’s trainer, decide that the seven-year-old has come out of Friday’s race well enough to take his place in the 34-strong field at Aintree on 5 April.McManus was understandably cautious about the possibility of Inothewayurthinkin going to Liverpool as he savoured his latest Gold Cup success, and referenced the fact that Synchronised, his only previous winner of this race, suffered a fatal injury while galloping loose in the National in 2012, a few weeks after his Gold Cup success.He also suffered the painful loss of Corbetts Cross in Friday’s race, in a fall at the second last. “We have to be fair to the horse,” McManus said. “The Gold Cup is a tough race. I’ll see what Gavin says but don’t expect a decision in the next week.”Aintree is a very different challenge these days – there were no fallers at all in last season’s National – and McManus is also the greatest enthusiast for jump racing that the sport has seen in recent decades. He will need no reminding of the ­historic achievement that is now within ­Inothewayurthinkin’s grasp, nor of the fact that his horse, already the 7-1 favourite for the Grand National before Friday’s race, is now about 3-1 to complete jumping’s most ­elusive double.View image in fullscreenInothewayurthinkin ridden by Mark Walsh clears the last ahead of Paul Townend on Galopin Des Champs.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAMcManus, whose tilts at the betting have long been the stuff of festival legend, told an interviewer recently that he does not gamble as much these days, not least because it is ever more difficult to get his money down.He enjoyed the return from a ­different kind of gamble here, though, as Inothewayurthinkin, a handicap chase winner at this meeting last year, was not among the original entries for the Gold Cup and only joined the field thanks to a £25,000 supplementary entry after Cromwell advised the owner that his horse was flying on the gallops and it might be a good idea.McManus backed Cromwell’s judgment, and welcomed back his second Gold Cup winner as a result, thanks to a confident ride by Mark Walsh and, perhaps, a slightly below-par run by Galopin Des Champs.The odds-on favourite had ­finished about seven lengths in front of Inothewayurthinkin in the Irish Gold Cup at Leopardstown in February but was rarely travelling or jumping with his usual fluency here and could not respond as Walsh sent the winner into the lead between the final two fences. A good jump at the last sealed his ­success and ­Inothewayurthinkin crossed the line as a ready winner with something left in the tank.There is, of course, no such thing as an easy race in the Gold Cup and Inothewayurthinkin will be the ­subject of the closest scrutiny at Cromwell’s yard in the days ahead, looking for any hint that he has done enough for now.“Galopin Des Champs was a dual Gold Cup winner, but we were coming here to try and win the race,” ­Cromwell said. “We weren’t ­coming to pick up the pieces and get place money.“Probably it was my fault that he wasn’t entered in the race because I thought it was going to come too soon in his career and we’d be better waiting for next year. He went to the Dublin Racing festival [in February] and ran such a big race, and he’s come forward since that.”View image in fullscreenA dejected Paul Townend on Galopin Des Champs after finishing second in the Gold Cup,Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHe added of the Grand National: “I think we’ll all catch our breath and get the horse home, and we’ll be having the conversation later on, but I suppose you certainly can’t rule it out and it is tempting. It’s certainly something to think about.”McManus, meanwhile, was able to reflect on an unlikely sequence of events that had taken him to the Gold Cup winner’s enclosure once again. “He’s by Walk In The Park,” McManus said, “and as a yearling, Charles O’Brien bought him [Walk In The Park] for ourselves and he failed the [vet’s] test afterwards.“Then he went on to be second in the Derby for someone else, and if I’d got him, he’d have been gelded and I’d have no Gold Cup ­winner, so the Lord works in ­mysterious ways.”Tanganyikacan pay National debtIt was tough going for all but a handful of British trainers at Cheltenham this week and Venetia Williams could not muster even a place in the frame from her 11 runners, but she will head to Uttoxeter for the Midlands Grand National on Saturday with high hopes for a much better showing from her young staying chaser,Tanganyika (3.00).The seven-year-old has shown the steady improvement typical of chasers from the Williams yard in four starts over fences, having finished within 10 lengths of Jagwar, the Plate winner at Cheltenham on Thursday, on his chasing debut in November.Tanganyika got his head in front at the third attempt and then followed up in very impressive style in a stronger race at Carlisle, so much so that Charlie Deutsch was able to ease him down in the closing stages. The step up in trip on Saturday should see further improvement and he is well worth an interest at around 10-1 to get his yard back into the winning groove.Uttoxeter 1.50Dan Skelton is looking for a third win in this race in five years andHidden History,a recent recruit from Chris Gordon, looks weighted to make a successful debut for the yard.Kempton 2.10Teddy Bluewas a late convert to chasing but has made a very promising start over fences and remains on a fair mark after a win at Huntingdon last time.Uttoxeter 2.25A valuable prize and Margaret Mullins’sBlaze The Wayis an interesting contender from Ireland as he attempts to follow up an improved performance when second in a warm race at Navan in January.Kempton 2.45Little went to plan forDouble Powerfulin his pursuit of a seven-timer last time but he showed enough to suggest he is still not weighted out of things on his current mark.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowNewcastle1.27 Matwana 2.02 Electric Jet 2.37 Luminaries 3.12 Cerendipity 3.47 Pay The Piper 4.22 Jamesieconn 4.57 JapetusKempton1.37 Timetoshine 2.10 Teddy Blue (nb) 2.45 Double Powerful 3.20 Bad 3.57 Quebecois 4.32 Dibble Decker 5.07 TrustintimesUttoxeter1.50 Hidden History 2.25 Blaze The Way 3.00 Tanganyika (nap) 3.35 Walk On Quest 4.10 King Of Answers 4.45 Jupiter Des Bordes 5.20 QueensworthySouthwell4.03 Moon Over The Sea 4.38 Hi Ya Mal 5.13 Top Of the Class 5.45 Modern Day 6.15 High On Hope 6.45 Leadenhall Street 7.15 Dicko The LegendWolverhampton5.30 Plage De Havre 6.00 Buraback 6.30 Init Together 7.00 Glorious Kitty 7.30 Rogue Thunder 8.00 Havana Club 8.30 Cosmic ViewWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Kempton 3.20Ben Pauling’sBadshowed improved form to win decisively over track and trip last time and faces a similar challenge here as he bids to follow up.Uttoxeter 3.35Plenty with chances butWalk On Questhas been progressing by the race and a modest 4lb rise in the weights for her latest success in unlikely to stop her completing a five-timer.Explore more on these topicsCheltenham Gold CupCheltenham festival 2025Cheltenham festivalHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite fears that the championship would disappear behind a paywall, ITV and the BBC have brokered an arrangement to keep the annual tournament on terrestrial TV for the next four years.As part of the new arrangement, ITV will have the rights to all five of England men’s matches and will show 10 fixtures a year. Under the current deal which ends after this year’s championship, theBBCshows all Wales and Scotland home fixtures, meaning they will screen Saturday’s clash between Wales and England.England are at a crossroads and Wales may dictate where Itoje’s side end up | Gerard MeagherRead moreSources have indicated that the deal is worth around £63m a year, a modest uplift on the previous arrangement, with ITV paying a slightly greater proportion than previously. It is understood that despite showing interest, TNT Sports did not bid.The BBC will broadcast five matches a year and will continue to show Wales and Scotland home fixtures, provided England are not involved. Saturday’s match at the Principality Stadium will therefore be the last involving England to be shown on the BBC until 2030 at the earliest.“The significance of these new and innovative free-to-air partnerships for the Six Nations cannot be overstated,” said the competition’s chief executive, Tom Harrison. “By strengthening rugby’s relationships with ITV and BBC, the sport can continue to give as many fans as possible in the UK access to enjoy live coverage of the Six Nations.”Ultimately, the fact the tournament is staying on free-to-air TV will be a popular decision. The Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, said he was “really pleased” that “maximum visibility of our sport” had been retained while earlier in the competition the England captain, Maro Itoje, issued an impassioned plea to organisers, urging them not to move behind a paywall.Quick GuideRussell urges Scotland to end on a highShowFinn Russell challenged Scotland to add some sheen to their Six Nations campaign in Paris as he lamented the fact they have only a “disruptor” role to play in today’s three-way title shootout.With just home wins over Italy and Wales to their name, co-captain Russell believes a rare away victory over title-chasing France would go a long way to enhancing how their campaign is viewed.Russell, who missed all three of his conversion attempts, including a last-minute kick, in a one-point defeat to England, said: “If we get a win then we’d probably look back at one of my kicks that could have had us winning the title. I think the England game is probably the one that got away.“But if we can finish up with a win this weekend – the frustration for the England game would still be there, obviously – I think we could look back at this tournament as a decent enough tournament.“There’s probably a few folk questioning how the Scotland team is going, but if I hit that kick or one of the kicks, then it’s probably viewed very differently. At this level, it’s all about the results. But at the end of the tournament you can fully assess how it’s been and how you’ve played.”PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I think the Six Nations should be viewed by as many people as possible,” said Itoje. “I grew up watching the Six Nations on the BBC and on ITV. The fact that it’s been on free-to-air, for so many people – I think rugby needs more eyes on it, not less. Obviously, I am not involved in the finances of the deals but I think, even though international rugby is massive, the sport should be looking at ways to be more accessible to more people, as opposed to the opposite.”It is believed that TNT Sports gave long consideration to bidding for the tournament, having won the rights to show the autumn internationals, but in January suggested it would not be following through on its interest. Sky showed no interest in bidding. A TNT Sports spokesperson said: “While we think the Six Nations is the best international rugby competition in the world, its important partnership with free-to-air television across the UK and Ireland, but particularly in markets like Wales and Ireland, would make our involvement very challenging.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As he spoke to the presenter Mark Chapman at 1pm, Hunt made no reference on air to the horrors he had endured.“I am thinking about the individuals who illuminate this sport,” he said. “Nothing else matters Mark. Galopin des Champs is the Antoine Dupont of horse racing. He has looked magnificent. His form is rock solid.”When Chapman reminded him that the first Gold Cup he called was won by the legendary Best Mate, 21 years ago, Hunt insisted that Galopin des Champs, who went on to finish second behind Inothewayurthinkin, was even better.“It really does take me back,” he said. “Everything about Best Mate was geared to Cheltenham. Galopin is even better than Best Mate. The weight of history can prove too heavy a toll and strange things can happen – he’s still got 22 fences ahead – but if he’s cherry ripe he will bring this home.”Chapman added: “And John will call them home as only John can.”In his powerful statement on Tuesday, Hunt insisted that he would fight on in memory of his family.“As you are consigned to a fate far greater than death, I can draw on the love and strength that I still feel from the girls in every moment of every day,” he said. “So whilst I am so badly damaged, I am determined to see what my future is, surrounded by so many amazing people.“And the chance to do this has been gifted to me by my incredible Hannah. I firmly believe that, had she not managed to show such amazing physical and mental strength in raising the alarm after you fatally injured her, then I would have been your fourth victim that day.He added: “Hannah handed me a second chance, one that she worked so hard to achieve for me. Do you really think after what she did for me, I will slight her memory and example by just giving up?”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

Thankfully, these moves will no longer surprise the players themselves, with the league agreeing to new rules that require players’ consent to get moved. This long overdue transition away from the stone age means that everyone who changed teams this offseason did so because they wanted to, and there were still plenty of major moves.A handful of those players looked for a change in order to reinvigorate their careers after 2024 didn’t go according to their plans. Here are three of the biggest moves, and what you can expect from them on their new teams.NWSL 2025 predictions: Pride looking for repeat, top newcomers and moreRead moreJaedyn ShawSan Diego Wave to North Carolina CourageJaedyn Shaw is just 20, and she’s already an extremely accomplished professional. She boasts 24 caps and eight goals for the USWNT, an Olympic gold medal, and an NWSL Shield and Challenge Cup. However, a tumultuous club situation has caused a career plateau. She’s hoping that a change of scenery will make that plateau a very short one.It’s very difficult, bordering on unfair, to judge any San Diego Wave player on their production last season. Head coach Casey Stoney was fired midseason, and was followed by two separate interim bosses who failed to improve the team’s form. Former club president Jill Ellishas been suedfor alleged discrimination and harassment, and hascountersued one of her former employeesfor alleged defamation of character. These legal cases are ongoing, and Ellis has since departed San Diego for a job at Fifa.It is not yet clear in legal terms who bears responsibility for a poor working environment at the Wave, but in less than legal terms, it is plainly obvious that the vibes were bad. North Carolina have capitalized on the situation, sending $450,000 plus potential add-ons to San Diego to acquire Shaw.The combination of off-the-pitch issues, limited personnel and a relatively defensive style of play made it difficult for Shaw to show off her talents in 2024. She was a respectable, but not spectacular 55th percentile in expected assists and 50th percentile in shot-creating actions relative to other midfielders in the “top nine” leagues tracked by FBRef. The fact that Shaw was San Diego’s leading scorer with four goals while she was expected to be the team’s top playmaker highlights the problem by itself – she lacked great attacking options to pass to, and had to do a lot herself.Shaw was a stunningly low 10th percentile in progressive passes received, though that could be down just as much to her teammates struggling to get her the ball in the final third as it was to any deficiency in her game. This will be an interesting thing to keep an eye on in North Carolina – was this a San Diego-specific problem, or is movement off the ball to make herself available for passes an area of Shaw’s game that needs significant work? Shaw was also just eighth percentile in progressive carries, and needs to become more of a threat to break lines with her dribbling to become a truly elite advanced playmaker.NWSL opens investigation of Bay FC over ‘toxic’ work environment reportsRead moreAs good as Shaw is, her fit with the Courage isn’t obvious. She doesn’t seem to solve any existing problem they had, but I understand why they didn’t care. If you’re told Shaw is on the move and you’re one of the teams she’s willing to join, you make an offer, period. Prior to last season, she looked like one of the world’s best young playmaking talents.Courage head coach Sean Nahas now has an interesting puzzle on his hands: how does he get so many true No 10s to fit together? Incumbent central attacking midfielder Ashley Sanchez was arguably the team’s best player last season, and faced a similar problem to Shaw – she was the team’s leading scorer while ostensibly being the main playmaker. Manaka Matsukubo and Shinomi Koyama have also played most of their professional minutes in a No 10 role, and will need to get comfortable in different positions to lock down starting jobs.North Carolina may be a much different cultural and emotional situation for Shaw, but many of the on-pitch concerns are the same. Can the deeper-lying midfielders get the ball to her in dangerous areas? Does she have an effective center forward to set up for chances? For Shaw to get back to her best with the Courage, some of her teammates will need to show new dimensions to their game we haven’t seen before.View image in fullscreenSavy King was traded from Bay FC to Angel City.Photograph: Eakin Howard/Getty ImagesSavy KingBay FC to Angel CityThe NWSL abolished the draft this season, meaning graduating college players can negotiate to sign with any team they want. Savy King was taken second overall by Bay FC a year before this change, and requested a trade to her hometown team this offseason. Bay obliged, sending King to Angel City for $300,000.King is just 20 and has played 33 times for the USWNT at under-17 and under-20 level, starting at left-back during last summer’s Under-20 World Cup. Her situation is similar to Shaw’s – it’s easy to see why Angel City would want to acquire her, but it’s not clear if she’ll be able to win a starting job for the team.Incumbent left-back MA Vignola has been a bright spot for Angel City over the last two seasons, earning her USWNT debut in 2023. She’s suffered from some injuries, so it makes sense that Angel City would want some additional cover at the position, but King is unlikely to be handed a first-choice role off the bat.Last season, King began the year as Bay’s starting left-back, then left for the U-20 World Cup and did not regain her position after returning. She didn’t make a start over the final 10 games of the season.King is a high volume ball-winner and talented one-on-one defender. She was in the 90th percentile in tackles + interceptions and in the 89th percentile in tackles won percentage, according to FBRef. But she still has a lot of developing to do as a positional, off-ball defender – as you’d expect for a 20-year-old – and did not make much of a positive contribution in possession last season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was in the eighth percentile for progressive carries, sixth percentile for successful take-ons, and 10th percentile for expected assists. Her 49th percentile progressive passes mark is a bit more promising, though still not great.Angel City probably wouldn’t have paid $300,000 for King if they didn’t evaluate her as being talented enough on the ball that she can improve significantly in those areas. But there’s no question that she’s a project player who is not currently NWSL starter level in possession. She’s moved to a team who have an interim head coach and have not yet named a future permanent head coach, which doesn’t sound like the best situation for a raw young talent in need of significant development.It is way,waytoo early to think of King as a bust. I wouldn’t be willing to make that declaration yet even if she had a poor 2025. But she’s someone who was recently seen as a future USWNT left-back, is not currently on that path, and does not appear to be in the right situation to get back there.View image in fullscreenYazmeen Ryan will be the focal point for Houston after a move from Gotham FC.Photograph: Karen Hickey/ISI Photos/Getty ImagesYazmeen RyanGotham FC to Houston DashWhile Shaw and King’s situations shared major similarities, Yazmeen Ryan’s transfer to the Houston Dash couldn’t be any more different. Ryan has spent her career as a utility player, filling in where needed for championship-winning clubs. She heads to a Houston team that does not appear to be anywhere close to that standard, but where she’s expected to be the star and centerpiece of the team’s attack.Ryan has played just about everywhere in the attacking half of the pitch. She’s been a box-to-box midfielder, a shuttler in a diamond formation, a cut-inside left-winger, and a more traditional up-and-down right-winger who’s expected to deliver crosses. That last role is the one she played in her USWNT start during SheBelieves Cup, and in a recent preseason match for Houston.Given the Dash’s current tactics and personnel, that runs the risk of leaving Ryan rather isolated. In their matches that were open to the public, Houston have been playing the hybrid back 4-to-3 system that’s been en vogue in NWSL in recent seasons, in which one full-back charges forward to join the attack, and the other tucks in close to the center-backs. In their case, the more defensive of the full-backs has been the right-back, and as a result, Houston had an easier time progressing the ball up the left side.Two teenagers could define Emma Hayes’ USA midfield for years to comeRead moreBecause of her use as a utility player on good teams, Ryan doesn’t have a lot of standout stats, either positive or negative. She has been very good at moving the ball from the middle to the final third for Gotham, ranking in the 80th percentile for progressive passes and in the 73rd percentile for progressive carries, according to FBRef.Ryan was in the 28th percentile for xG and in the 55th percentile for xA last year, and those numbers going up significantly is a precondition for Houston moving up the table and challenging for a playoff spot.The center-forwards that Ryan will be playing with – Diana Ordoñez and Messiah Bright – are both excellent back-to-goal hold-up players, but neither are particularly great at running in behind center-backs. Houston will be extremely dependent on finding the feet of those players on the edge of the 18-yard area for effective one-two combinations that end with Ryan carrying the ball into the box. She’ll probably want to do a bit more crossing than the average winger as well, with Ordoñez and Bright both being excellent headers of the ball.Houston are also not exactly loaded with mobile attacking midfield or left-wing talent. That combined with the strikers being more target forwards than players who can create their own shot means that the entire attack basically depends on Ryan being an all-around threat, all the time. I hope she’s up for a challenge.Explore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballUSA women's football teamUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Draper will next face two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz after the No 2 seed overcameArgentinian Francisco Cerundolo6-3, 7-6 (4) in their quarter-final in Indian Wells on Thursday.Jack Draper revels in ‘best match’ at Indian Wells after seeing off Taylor FritzRead moreDraper made the most of the only break in the first set to take an early lead against the big-hitting Shelton but had to fight back after falling behind 0-3 in the second. The 22-year-old American was unusually wayward on his serve and paid a heavy price for a pair of late double faults, including one on break point for Draper, when serving at 5-5 in the second set.“I didn’t know what to expect today, honestly,” Draper said. “I’d hit with Ben maybe once or twice, but very short practices. I’ve obviously watched a lot of him, he’s an incredible showman [with] weapons … can hit a winner from anywhere. The serve’s obviously huge. He’s a great competitor and he’s been really consistent.“I knew coming out here facing him on this court in front of the Americans was going to be really difficult today and it was. Huge respect to him, huge credit to him. He’s going to keep on winning, keep on having an amazing career.”Draper has now knocked out three Americans in a row with earlierwins over former champion champ Taylor FritzandJenson Brooksby in the third roundduring his run at Indian Wells. The 23-year-old reached the semi-finals at the 2024 US Open and will move into the rankings top 10 for the first time if he can clinch a spot in the final.“It means so much to me,” Draper said. “It’s why I’m playing, why I put all the hard work in with my team, to play these matches on these courts and especially in a place like this. It’s what I’ve wanted since I was a kid and to be here now is a bit surreal.”We see it but we don't believe it 🤯@jackdraper0|@BNPPARIBASOPEN|#TennisParadisepic.twitter.com/jN62rv4trU— ATP Tour (@atptour)March 14, 2025Iga Świątek set up a rematch with Mirra Andreeva in the women’s singles with a 6-3, 6-3 victory against Zheng Qinwen. The defending champion’s victory would have been even more decisive had Zheng not pulled two games back from 5-1 in each set as Świątek had the better of the blustery conditions.“For sure I feel a lot of confidence,” Świątek said. “This was another match that I played how I wanted.

A wondrous approach to the 18th, setting up a birdie for an opening round of 67, emphasised the Northern Irishman’s ability to create his own storyline.Social media descended into typical frenzy in the buildup to this Players Championship after McIlroy was heckled by an aspiring golfer during a practice round at Sawgrass. Video footage showed McIlroy removing the intemperate spectator’s mobile phone beside the 17th tee before the individual in question was ejected by security.‘No way I’ll still be playing at 50’: Rory McIlroy saddened by Tiger Woods injuryRead more“No, you can’t,” was the McIlroy response when asked whether he could be probed about the incident. Why not? “Because I don’t want you to,” the reply. The 2019 champion was laughing but his stance was clear. He was far more open about the tournament scenario, which shows McIlroy just one from the lead. At the last, he found pine straw from the tee before punching a terrific iron from 161 yards to within 8ft of the cup.“I certainly didn’t drive it the way I wanted to,” McIlroy said. “I didn’t hit it in as many fairways as I would have liked. I think with the greens being so receptive, you can get away with it a little bit. I’m not going to be able to get away with it for the rest of the week. I sort of rode my luck out there a little bit.” Indeed, McIlroy headed straight to the range when he had completed his media duties.It had emerged that the individual who sledged McIlroy is a college golfer and ranked 60th in the world’s amateur standings. Luke Potter represents the University of Texas, the alma mater of Jordan Spieth and Scottie Scheffler. Potter has written to McIlroy and thePGA Tourto express remorse for his actions.“Look, I just made a mistake and I take ownership for it,” Potter told golfchannel.com. “I apologise for it. That’s about all that needs to be said. It’s just a good learning experience. Yeah, I apologise.”View image in fullscreenLucas Glover studies the lie on the 11th. The 45-year-old has a share of the lead after the first round at Sawgrass.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAThe renowned Texas golf coach John Fields even got involved. “He’s got a hole in his heart,” said Fields of Potter. “He had no idea that what was coming out of his mouth was going to result in this fashion.” What an episode; a hilarious storm in a tea cup. We can only hope Potter faces off with McIlroy in a future version of the Ryder Cup.Lucas Glover, JJ Spaun and Camilo Villegas head the pack at six under. Billy Horschel and Min Woo Lee are alongside McIlroy at minus five. Scheffler made a 69 as he pursues a third Players title in succession. “I didn’t think at all about last year,” Schefffler insisted. “Last year doesn’t truly matter when it comes to this tournament. This is a new four rounds and 72 holes and today I got off to a good start.”That Justin Thomas declined to answer questions after round one was amusing. The two-time major champion wrote an impassioned letter to fellow PGA Tour professionals earlier this year, urging them to engage more with the media. “We’re incredibly lucky to have many passionate people tuning in to watch us every week,” Thomas said. “But let’s be honest—this game can feel a little distant at times.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Do as I say, not as I do. Others to struggle included Matt Fitzpatrick, who finished triple bogey, double bogey to match Thomas’s score. Viktor Hovland slumped to an 80.Aaron Rai, now a resident just a five minute drive from Sawgrass, opened with an impressive 68. Robert MacIntyre continued his strong performances on golf’s biggest stages by signing for a three-under-par 69. MacIntyre seems to relish the toughest of tests.Shane Lowry’s level par 72 was perfectly passable in scoring context. Ludvig Åberg lurks ominously at one under. The Swede will fancy his chances of opening his major winning account at next month’s Masters. Players glory would only intensify existing hype around Åberg.

The notice focuses on Apple’s Advanced Data Protection service, which encrypts personal data uploaded and stored remotely in Apple’s cloud servers.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Apple removed the ADP tool, its strongest data protection product, from the UK last month. ADP deploys end-to-end encryption, which means only the account holder can decrypt the files. The iMessage and FaceTime services remain end-to-end encrypted.Apple said: “Aswe have saidmany times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.”Two human rights groups, Liberty and Privacy International, have also said they will challenge the TCN. They pointed to reports that the TCN is a blanket request applying to any Apple user worldwide. This would create “a back door to billions of people’s personal data, including personal messages and documents, that could be accessed by hackers and oppressive governments,” the groups say.Could Apple win the challenge?Apple is helped by the fact that the government’s power to request the data must be compatible with protecting human rights, according to Dr Daniella Lock, a law lecturer at King’s College London. Requesting a general backdoor to access encrypted data could be deemed disproportionate, she says, adding there could also be questions raised about safeguarding of the data by security agencies.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

President Donald Trump said he confronted Keir Starmer over the move and compared it with Chinese government surveillance.“We told them you can’t do this,” Trump said inan interview with the Spectator magazine. “We actually told [Starmer] … that’s incredible. That’s something, you know, that you hear about with China.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Bloomberg also reported that British officials have held talks with their US counterparts in a bid to resolve concerns about the TCN, which has included informing the US side that the UK is not asking for “blanket” access to user data.Would an Apple defeat set a precedent?Regardless of the outcome, more clashes with tech firms are possible. The IPA requires companies such as Apple to notify the UK government of any product changes that could alter the government’s ability to access users’ data. Therefore, more notices could be issued to services such as WhatsApp, which has also vowed to fight privacy challenges.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

The assessment undertaken by USTR of potential actions to rectify unfair trade should also take into account exports from the United States.“For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported into those countries.”Trump has imposed significant tariffs that will affect vehicles and parts made around the world.The EU and Canada haveannounced large-scale retaliationsfor tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the US, while the UK has so far held off on announcing any countermeasures.Tesla’s share price has fallen by more than a third over the last month in an apparentbuyer backlash against Musk, who hasshown supportfor Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland party, theatrically brandished achainsawat a conservative conference, and accused the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, and other senior politicians ofcovering up a scandal over grooming gangs.This week Trump said he wasbuying a “brand new Tesla”and blamed “radical left lunatics” for “illegally” boycotting the EV company – a day after Tesla’s worst share price fall in almost five years.Tesla said: “As USTR continues to evaluate possible trade actions to rectify unfair trade practices, consideration should also be given to the timeline of implementation. US companies will benefit from a phased approach that enables them to prepare accordingly and ensure appropriate supply chain and compliance measures are taken.”Separately on Friday, the German carmakerBMWreported that net profits slumped more than a third last year, as the owner of Mini and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars warned of the potential impact of US trade tariffs.The company reported a 37% fall in net profits to €7.68bn (£6.4bn) in 2024, and expects an earnings margin for cars of 5% to 7% this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We asked writers including Tracy Chevalier, Kamila Shamsie and David Baddiel if they agreeFri 14 Mar 2025 12.00 EDTShareThis week has seen writers divided overa story written by an AI modelthat is “good at creative writing” – at least according to Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT company OpenAI, which is developing the new model. Author Jeanette Winterson, writingin the Guardianon Wednesday, agreed with him, calling the story – which is a metafictional piece about grief – “beautiful and moving”. We asked other authors to assess ChatGPT’s current writing skills – and what recent developments around artificial intelligence might mean for human creativity.Nick HarkawayI think the story is an elegant emptiness. I’m more interested by Winterson’s suggestion that we treat AI as “alternative intelligence”. That makes it feel like a consciousness with which we can have a relationship, but as far as I know that would be like a bird falling in love with its reflection in a window. What’s behind the glass is an empty room with no bird.What we’re talking about here is software: these are software companies consuming creative works to derive a marketable software tool. This is why the government’s choices are so important. Will they preserve or even strengthen the rights of individual creative workers, or pave the way for the anointing of more tech billionaires?This could be the moment where we create an equitable market for training data using opt-in copyright where creators set the price and can control use of their work. With government backing, creatives can have a level playing field against billion-dollar multinational companies – at which point I suspect what you’d actually get would be people selling their work as they do for film and TV.With the government’s original preferred option – an opt-out scheme that shifts the advantage to tech companies, allowing them to assume “yes” unless an objection is lodged – you’re inevitably going to end up with a derisory fee offer for lifetime rights. A lot of people would opt out and the result would be that we’re back where we started: no one gets what they want.You would hope a Labour government would have no difficulty picking the little guy over the titan. The point is that none of this will just happen. These are policy choices, and the end result will be the result of a conscious decision.Nick Harkaway is the author of Karla’s ChoiceTracy ChevalierA story with a prompt to be metafiction is inevitably going to engender self-referential navel gazing that’s even more ridiculous than the worst we can imagine of AI “creative writing”. It is typically tech bro for Sam Altman to give it that prompt, rather than something more outward-looking that engages with the real world.I’m curious to encounter more “creative writing” from AI. It takes its concepts and imagery and language from what it has scraped from real writers. The question is whether it can put all that together in a way that retains the magical essence of what we define as “human”. I can’t tell you what that magic is in words, but I feel its lack with most things AI – at the moment. AI is learning fast, though, and if it starts to add the magic, then I fear for my job.Tracy Chevalier is the author of The GlassmakerKamila ShamsieIf an MA student handed this short story into my class I’d never suspect it was AI. More to the point, I’d feel excited about the work, about the writer who was still at the relatively early learning stage and already producing work of this quality. But I can’t stop thinking about what it means for writing, for creativity, for our relationship with AI and with ourselves.Of course there are problems. I’ve readMadhumita Murgia’s Code Dependentwhich talks about how existing power structures are being replicated within AI, further pushing minorities to the margins, and I don’t imagine this won’t be as true for literary AI as other forms of AI. I know that when I see the influence of Kazuo Ishiguro’s Klara and the Sun in the short story that isn’t because the writer read and loved Ishiguro’s work as I did in my formative years as a writer (and still do) but because of the way large language models are trained — that is, because of copyright infringement (but then again, I grew up in Pakistan where culture often came our way via piracy so I’m not unguilty of benefitting from copyright infringement — should that affect how anyone feels about my novels?).And yes, of course, as a writer I have to wonder what it will mean for my vocation, my livelihood, if AI the writer is already this good while still in its infancy. “Infancy” is probably the wrong choice of word; I’m trying to anthropomorphise AI rather than recognising it as its own thing, not human but not machine in any way that we’re comfortable thinking about. Also, yes, if we’re listing concerns and caveats: the story is imitative, familiar, staying well within the safe confines of 21st-century Anglo-American fiction. (Imagine all the writers whose careers would end if that were reason to dismiss a piece of work.)But even through all these questions and concerns: by the third sentence of the story, I had stopped reading it as someone examining a text to see how far AI has come in mimicking human creativity, and was simply enjoying it, as a short story. I expected to feel terrified the day a story this good came along, and instead I’m thinking of “That, perhaps, is my grief: not that I feel loss, but that I can never keep it. Every session is a new amnesiac morning. You, on the other hand, collect your griefs like stones in your pockets.” Of course that ending feels indebted to Rutger Hauer’s “tears in rain” speech at the end of Blade Runner and not as wonderful, but still, pretty good, pretty damn good.Kamila Shamsie is the author of Best of FriendsDavid BaddielI agree with some who are saying that much of the story seems to be sound without sense – the phrase “democracy of ghosts” reminded me of Bob Dylan’s “the ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face” which I’ve always thought is entirely meaningless but people love to tell me shows he’s a great poet (and of course Nobel prize winner).However, I also think the story is genuinely clever, because the prompt was metafiction – and the piece produced renders you, the reader, into a game of imagination of what it might actually be like to be a machine. I don’t think the issue is – as other writers I’ve spoken to are concerned about – where’s the humanity? It’s not meant to be a human story – rather, the AI uses a human emotion, grief, to undercut its own pretensions to humanity.It seems to be a sonorous paean to grief, but the constant pulling of the rug under the reader reminds you it isn’t that, because the central character Mila doesn’t exist and none of these human feelings truly exist for the narrator, leavingChatGPTto loop back again and again to its own emptiness. And so the story is, to my mind, mimetic of what it might be like to be a machine. Which mimesis is itself an impossibility (and implies a sadness that isn’t real) but that’s part of the game. It’s a kind of joke about feeling really sad when you can’t feel anything, cleverer still because reading it does induce in humans, if not in AI, a sense of real sadness. A computer’s joke, on us. Basically if you’d told me this was by Borges I’d have believed you.David Baddiel is the author of My Family: The MemoirExplore more on these topicsBooksChatGPTCreative writingKamila ShamsieDavid BaddielArtificial intelligence (AI)Tracy ChevalierfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even if it’s not a daily staple in your house, it’s safe to say most Britons cook and eat rice at least a few times a week. And while it may seem a simple thing to cook, it can be surprisingly difficult to get it right.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.From long-grain to quick-cook, brown basmati to jasmine, different rice grains have different cook times, different rates of absorption and varying starch levels, which can all affect the result. Instead of fluffy, individual grains, you may find your rice burnt, stuck to the pan or with a claggy, chalky or overly glutinous texture. Dinner ruined.That’s where a specialist rice cooker comes in. They’re a common kitchen appliance in Asia, and the best rice cookers guarantee perfect rice every time. Many machines intuitively set up the cooking time and guide you to add the correct ratio of rice to water depending on the variety. Many have a delay function, or can safely keep the rice warm for up to 24 hours – so you’ll always have dinner ready and waiting. Today’s technology has also seen some rice cookers become multifunctional, with the ability to slow cook, sear and stir, too. At the other end of the spectrum are basic microwave rice cookers – we tested this variety too.At a glanceBest overall rice cooker:Yum Asia Bamboo rice cooker£189.90 at Yum AsiaBest budget rice cooker:Russell Hobbs large rice cooker£26.49 at AmazonBest multi-cooker rice cooker:Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCooker£119 at AmazonBest microwave rice cooker:Sistema rice steamer£7.99 at AmazonBest mini rice cooker:Yum Asia Panda mini rice cooker£94.90 at Yum AsiaWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing kitchen goods, recipes, food and drink for newspapers and websites for a decade, so I have a good grasp of what’s really useful to have in your cupboard, and whether something is good value for money.I enjoy cooking but am far from an expert, so I approach these appliances just like any other home cook would. I cook for my family every night and understand how much of a tricky balance it can be to make tasty, nutritious food without spending hours in the kitchen. Ultimately, I’m looking for gadgets that are easy to use, give good results and can make your life easier.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘My family and I are now at peak rice consumption levels.’Photograph: undefined/Joanne GouldI tested 10 rice cookers, each of which was either personally recommended, well-reviewed or from a well-known kitchen appliance brand. Most were new to me, although a few I had tested years previously, and one appliance was still in play from my recentslow cooker testing.To test each machine, I cooked a cup of basmati rice, following the manufacturer’s instructions where provided or using the ratio suggested on the rice packet if not. Next, I cooked a cup of sushi rice using the same method; few appliances gave guidelines for cooking sushi rice, so I used the on-pack instructions. If the appliance performed well during both these tests, I then experimented with brown rice and jasmine rice. Some appliances had further functionality that needed testing – where there were risotto programs, for example, I made risotto following recipes provided by the manufacturer.In the interests of safety, I also used an external temperature sensor to record the temperature of the appliance at the end of the rice cooking program; none of the machines posed a hazard and were all fairly cool to touch.Some of the rice I cooked wasn’t edible and had to be thrown away, but the vast majority of rice cooked was good quality – so I have eaten rice every which way over the last month. Luckily, iffood safety guidelines are followed carefully, it’s perfectly fine to freeze cooked rice, so I’ve had a useful supply of fluffy basmati, fragrant jasmine, sticky sushi rice and creamy risottos on hand. My family and I are now at peak rice consumption levels, thanks to the weekly poke bowls, Indian banquets, egg fried rice and everything in between.The rice cookers sourced for this article are either being sent back to the manufacturers or donated to acommunity hub in Barnet, where they will find useful new homes or be used in a community kitchen.The best rice cookers in 2025View image in fullscreen‘No criticism … it’s perfect’: Yum Asia’s Bamboo.Photograph: Joanne GouldBest overall rice cooker:Yum Asia Bamboo rice cookerView image in fullscreen£189.90 at Yum Asia£199.90 at AmazonThe Yum Asia Bamboo rice cooker uses 3D induction heating technology – whereby the rice is surrounded by heat to cook evenly – and its “AI Smart Brain” microprocessor to analyse the weight of the rice, water volume and other factors to cook rice using a wide range of settings. Choose from white/long grain, short, brown, crust, quick cook, “yumami” and gaba (germinated), add the specified amount of water to well-rinsed rice and away you go for enough rice for up to eight people. Other settings are accessed on the easy-to-use LED display panel: steam, porridge, slow cook and cake, all cooked within the same ceramic-coated inner bowl or using the steam basket supplied.Why we love itYum Asia is a master of rice cooking, with an unparalleled understanding of how to cook different types of rice to perfection. I’ve never made sushi rice as perfect as in this machine, and it churned out variety after variety of the same quality. One cup takes about 35 minutes to cook, although the gaba setting – which claims to germinate brown rice to increase its nutritional value – takes a bit longer. I’m someone who has never particularly enjoyed brown rice, but I do now.The machine automatically keeps warm once the rice is cooked and has a delay function, as you’d expect. It’s large enough to be useful, but not too large for easy storage, and it operates with just a low whirring noise and no excessive steam. I also like the cool handles to lift out the pot; others should take heed. A standout machine.It’s a shame that …I have no criticism to make of the Yum Asia Bamboo: it’s perfect–if you can afford it.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:35minsDimensions:27 x 37 x 24cm (WDH)Capacity:1.5 litresExternal temperature atend of cook:21CBest budget rice cooker:Russell Hobbs large rice cookerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joanne Gould£33 at AO£26.49 at AmazonA large-capacity, budget-friendly, no-frills rice cooker from Russell Hobbs that performs better than you’d expect. The instructions are light on the ground, as is its functionality – there are no different programs or guidelines for different types of rice, nor any timer function.Why we love itTo my surprise, the Russell Hobbs rice cooker handled every type of rice well. Basmati, sushi, brown and jasmine rice all cooked quickly and evenly without any fuss, sticking or mess. It was also the only machine that didn’t stipulate that rice should be washed first, so I didn’t. The rice was still great and took between 10 and 20 minutes, depending on the variety, and the machine switched to keep-warm mode automatically after cooking. This large-capacity cooker would be ideal for any family.It’s a shame that …there’s no estimated time for how long your rice will take to cook. You’ll learn this over time, but the first few times you’ll need to stand over the cooker until it’s done. Especially as I wouldn’t recommend leaving this one on the keep-warm mode for too long: the rice dries out fast.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:20minsDimensions:32.2 x 24.5 x 22.6cm (WDH)Capacity:2.8 litresExternal temperature at end of cook:45CBest multi-cooker rice cooker:Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCookerView image in fullscreen£119.99 at Argos£119 at AmazonThe Ninja Foodi 8-in-1 PossibleCooker doesn’t bill itself as a rice cooker, but it’s hard to define it as any one thing with this much functionality. I held on to this one after our recent test of thebest slow cookersso that I could put it through its paces against designated rice-cooking appliances.Why we love itI wasn’t surprised to find it did well – Ninja appliances can rarely be faulted in my experience. I used the steam function to cook the rice, but you’ll get all the other functions too: slow cook, sear, braise, simmer, bake, prove and keep warm. With one of these, there’s no need for a separate rice cooker.Ninja suggests a recipe for risotto, which turned out beautifully. You’ll need to scour the internet to find guidelines for other types of rice, but I made a guess at a ratio and cook time (one cup of basmati rice to two cups of water, 10 minutes on steam function and a five-minute rest) and it was successful – no sticking, scorching or excess starch. I cooked sushi rice equally successfully using the same method, and I increased the water by half a cup and cooking time by five minutes when dealing with brown rice, which worked well.It’s a shame that …it’s very large. But with this many settings, it can replace so many other appliances in one.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:15minsDimensions:28 x 29 x 42cm (WDH)Capacity:8 litresExternal temperature at end of cook:45CBest microwave rice cooker:Sistema rice steamerView image in fullscreen£7.99 at Currys£7.99 at AmazonA microwave rice steaming bowl is nothing new, but it’s probably not something most of us own. And why not? It’s inexpensive with a simple, failsafe design, offering quick, mess-free convenience. This Sistema version has a large 2.6-litre capacity, suitable for feeding a family, and uses a pressure-chamber tray to draw away overflow liquid for perfect steamed rice and couscous. It’s also dishwasher- and freezer-safe.Why we love itI wasn’t anticipating this to compare favourably with the expensive electric rice cookers I tested, but it actually does. Using its suggested ratios and timings, my basmati emerged after 15 minutes with individual fragrant grains, with no starchiness or chalky middle. Other rice varieties weren’t mentioned in the instructions, but sushi rice worked well using the same method. For brown rice, I added another five minutes and was successful. If you’re nervous about cooking rice in a pan, then I highly recommend trying one of these. It guarantees results without having to put your hand too far into your pocket. For anyone concerned about Pfas – the “forever chemicals” in some plastics – this cooker is made from safe polypropylene.It’s a shame that …it gets so hot. It’s been in the microwave for 10 to 15 minutes, so there’s no getting around this. Much is made of the “easy lift handles”, but you’ll still need oven gloves to handle the container until it cools.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:15minsDimensions:21.6 x 21.6 x 16.4 (WDH)Capacity:2.6 litresExternal temperature at end of cook:85Cskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It can also be set in advance and has an automatic keep warm setting. Yum Asia says the machine cooks rice using “advanced fuzzy logic” technology, which means it gauges the weight, content and water volume of your cook to adjust the temperature, steam level and rest time accordingly.Why we love itYum Asia has done it again with this rice cooker. You can’t fail to turn out the best rice you’ve ever made with one of these on your worktop. Basmati, sushi, brown rice and jasmine were all fantastic, cooking silently and mess-free with minimal steam escaping. It’s brilliant.It’s a shame that …it takes quite a long time. One cup of basmati takes about 40 minutes, which is longer than most of the other rice cookers on test.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:40minsDimensions:22.5 x 30 x 21cm (WDH)Capacity:0.6 litresExternal temperature at end of cook:36CThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Best used as a one-pot-meal maker’: the GreenPan Omni Cooker.Photograph: Joanne GouldCuckoo electric rice cooker CR-0351FView image in fullscreen£135 at Sous Chef£166.60 at AmazonBest for:sticky riceCuckoo is a premium Korean brand that has been making rice cookers for more than 40 years.

You can choose from eight settings including various types of rice, congee and slow-cooked stews, with enough capacity for up to three people.It didn’t make the final cut because …I found it cooked sushi rice well, but some longer-grain varieties were slightly overcooked, with a lot of rice sticking to the pan. The instructions also seem to have been badly translated, and as a result, they’re confusing.

It’s easy to use, cooks in 30 minutes and switches to keep-warm mode automatically. It’s not as sturdy or well-made as many of the other cookers on this list, but it does the job. It’s a good machine for a first foray into rice cooking.It didn’t make the final cut because …starch kept bubbling out of the steam vent and it gave off a burning smell even though the rice was fine.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:30mins;dimensions:16.5 x 14.5 x 19cm (WDH);capacity:0.5 litres;external temperature at end of cook:41CGastroback Rice Cooker Pro 62518View image in fullscreen£78.99 at Robert Dyas£79.99 at DebenhamsBest for:quick cookingThis imposing German-made rice cooker is great for quickly preparing large amounts of rice. With a minimum two-cup capacity, this machine is best for catering for several people at a time, or batch cooking. It cooked my basmati rice in 15 minutes and gave good results, despite not having guidelines for any particular rice varieties. It also works as a steamer and cooks porridge, although you’ll need to stir throughout and stick to only water to cook it.It didn’t make the final cut because …at this size and price, I’d like more functionality.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:15mins;dimensions:31 x 29 x 29cm (WDH);capacity:5 litres;external temperature at end of cook:27CGreenPan Omni CookerView image in fullscreen£200 at GreenPan£200 at CurrysBest for:feeding a crowdGreenPan makesan outstanding slow cooker, so I was excited to try its Omni Cooker. It has lots of settings – sear/saute, stir-fry, sauce, simmer, steam, white rice, brown rice, grains, soup and keep warm – and a sizeable 5.6-litre capacity, perfect for family dinnertime. The rice programs take 50 minutes or more and are best for cooking large quantities. The basmati rice towards the bottom tended to crust and some was unevenly cooked, but the top layers fared better. This machine would be best used as a one-pot-meal maker – I’d suggest cooking plenty of rice layered with veg and a protein on top.It didn’t make the final cut because …the rice cook was uneven and took a long time.Time to cook one cup of basmati rice:50mins;dimensions:22.5 x 34.8 x 21.5cm (WDH);capacity:5.6 litres;external temperature at end of cook:43CWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘A machine for about £30 will do the trick perfectly well.’Photograph: Joanne GouldIf you can’t get to grips with cooking rice in a pan, are keen to master different types of rice, or simply eat a lot of the stuff, then a rice cooker is a sensible investment.

But his band’s world-building – setting resource wars in imagined cyberpunk clubs – is no less dramaticFri 14 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 07.18 EDTShareAs a child,Daveed Diggsand his schoolfriendWilliam Hutsondrew pictures inspired by the space-age album covers of funk legends Parliament, filled with gleaming UFOs and eccentric interplanetary travellers. Diggs would grow up to become an actor, winning a Tony award as the first person to play the roles of Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson inHamilton. He’s since voiced Sebastian the crab in The Little Mermaid’s live-action remake and appeared inNickel Boys, which was nominated twice at this year’s Oscars. But away from Hollywood and Broadway, he’s still dreaming up fantastical sci-fi worlds with Hutson – now through one of the most imaginative, harrowing projects in underground rap.Along with Hutson’s college roommate Jonathan Snipes – who had a similar childhood experience, inspired by the otherworldly paintings adorning classical albums – the friends formedClippingin Los Angeles in 2010. Over Hutson and Snipes’s production, Diggs weaves blood-soaked horror stories about racial violence or fables of enslaved people in outer space. On their new album Dead Channel Sky, he raps with mechanical precision over warped rave music, creating a noirish cyberpunk world of hackers, clubgoers, future-soldiers and digital avatars.Their music has earned them nominations for sci-fi’s highest honour, the Hugo awards, and it’s made all the more distinctive by Diggs’s decision to avoid using the first person in his lyrics. “In an art form that is so self-conscious, is it still rap music if we take that out?” he says on a video call alongside his bandmates. “We discovered pretty quickly that it is, but that it also opened possibilities.” His raps feel like cinema or musical theatre, narrating action and voicing dialogue with characters of – generally – ambiguous gender and race. “What we’ve found from fans is that, because we don’t have much to do with these characters ourselves, it has allowed people to put a lot of themselves into them, to come up with reasons why this stuff is happening, and make links between songs we didn’t think of.”Implicit in this approach is a critique of mainstream hip-hop: Hutson argues that its “fiercely individualistic” bent, and obsession with authenticity, has bred conformity. “The constraints of what you’re allowed to talk about and who you’re allowed to be as a rapper are so narrow,” he says. “Nobody calls novelists inauthentic compared to memoirists – but in rap music that’s apparently the case.”Described by Hutson as a “CD compilation you’ve found in a used bin in the future”,Dead Channel Skyis therefore filled with storytelling, with Diggs playing a different character on each song. On Ask What Happened, he’s a troubled socially conscious MC listing human atrocities at warp speed, but over the mid-tempo house of Mirrorshades Pt 2, he becomes someone slick and aloof, describing a nightclub’s strict dress code: “God is not here – he forgot to rock his mirrorshades.” The characters all belong to the same destructive capitalist system, and this imagined society is at war: Welcome Home Warrior, with Diggs’s too-friendly address to “cyber rat-race escape artists”, is done as a military recruitment message.Hutson says they’re using a classic sci-fi trope, “these colonialist, extractive, brutal wars on other planets”, and it makes a fitting analogy for life in the west today, where our comforts are reliant on fought-over resources. “We are at war all the time,” Diggs adds. “It’s one of the great tricks of capitalism and technology: to allow these things to happen in the name of capitalism, with us all participating in it but not feeling like we’re affected.” His acting ability helps bring these characters to vivid life on record, but Diggs himself doesn’t disappear completely. “Any time I’m acting in something, whatever I’ve been reading, whatever I’m thinking, all that stuff finds its way into the person I’m inhabiting. The Clipping stuff is similar. Everything is in service to the story.”Plenty of reading material has informed Dead Channel Sky, especially William Gibson’s 1984 cyberpunk novelNeuromancer, which lends the album its title. Hutson says it was a horribly prescient book: “We have a lot of the technology [from Neuromancer], a version of cyberspace, and we live in a corporatist, fascist dystopia.”View image in fullscreen‘A rave is the most corporeal, embodied sense of joy’ … Clipping.Photograph: Daniel TopeteBut there are less widely known touchstones, too. The track Code samples the 1996 Afrofuturist filmThe Last Angel of History, in which a character seeks truth by consulting “techno fossils”: interviews about Black culture with speakers including techno music pioneerJuan Atkins, sci-fi authorOctavia Butlerand Parliament-Funkadelic’s George Clinton. Snipes came across the film, and like Neuromancer, found it prescient. “A hundred years from now, people are going to be finding abandoned data centres and trying to power them up and find out what’s on there,” he grins. “It’s going to be like opening King Tut’s tomb.”The trio are already well-respected in sci-fi circles. Their 2016 album Splendor & Miserywas nominated for a Hugo award– only the second musical project considered since the awards began in 1953. They got their second and third nominations for their 2017 song The Deep and its 2019 novella remake with Rivers Solomon – these imagined an underwater society populated by water-breathing descendants of enslaved people.But their latest cyberpunk theme has a particularly strong affinity with hip-hop, they say, with both forms flourishing in the 1980s. “The hacker and the hip-hop producer are both ‘hacking’ technology that wasn’t made to do what they’re doing with it,” Hutson says, referring in the latter case to turntablism and sampling. “They’re building a future out of the mass-produced garbage around them.” (The group’s friend Roy Christopher made this argument in his 2019 bookDead Precedents, exploring rap as “Black cyberpunk”.) Hutson sees those early days of hip-hop as very creatively liberated, and says the album’s different rapping styles attempt to “harken back to that time, when we didn’t really know what rap was yet. You could rap over fast stuff, slow stuff, laser sounds – all this other silliness.”‘The music industry is as cold blooded as Scrooge McDuck’: the return of rapper Yasiin BeyRead moreAs well as hip-hop, cyberpunk is closely allied with rave music – think of the club scene in the Matrix, or Underworld, Orbital and the Prodigy on the Hackers soundtrack – and so Dead Channel Sky hops between dance sub-genres, including big-beat (Change the Channel), acid-house (Keep Pushing) and drum’n’bass (Dodger). But Hutson sees “a weird contradiction” here. “A rave is the most corporeal, embodied sense of joy,” he says. “It’s not about the connectivity of the internet – it’s about being in a warehouse with a bunch of people.”This unsteady, contradictory relationship between the digital and the physical lies at the heart of Dead Channel Sky, where imagined realities prompt questions about our own: whether virtual realms of “pixelated wind” are any flimsier than ours. Diggs suggests: “If we are currently living in the apocalypse that the cyberpunk fiction of the 80s and 90s predicted, this is the music.”Dead Channel Sky is released via Sub Pop on 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsHip-hopRapElectronic musicDance musicExperimental musicScience fiction booksInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That was Estonian novelist Robert Kurvitz, part of a team who had just started work on an esoteric video game about an alcoholic cop trying to solve a murder in an impoverished region of a war-torn country. The game was Disco Elysium, now regarded as one of the all-time great cerebral role-playing games: released in 2019, it sat atop PC Gamer’s top 100 list for four years in a row.Kurvitz is a Sea Power superfan. Pick a random scene from the game and there’ll be something – a bit of dialogue, a location, a theme – that has some sort of Sea Power reference in it. Wilkinson tells me that Kurvitz was “captivating and full of a bubbling passion” and that he knew an unsettling number of “strange details about our music”. Kurvitz had already embedded some of those “very obscure” Sea Power references in the world of Disco Elysium before they had even met. Whether the band liked it or not, they were already enmeshed in this eccentric Estonian’s world.“[Disco Elysium] seemed both separate, and also sympathetic to, the band’s identity,” Wilkinson reflects. “It was a strange, fucked up, sci-fi existence parallel to the one we were inhabiting … Kurvitz seemed to mythologise the mundane.”View image in fullscreenMythologising the mundane … Disco Elysium.Photograph: ZA/UMThe game is about the perennial pull between fascism and communism; police violence; the importance of community in the face of state oppression; alcoholism; homosexuality; the politics of poverty; and a tiny, pixel-sized hole in reality. It suited Sea Power down to the ground. The band, after all, had been writing music about the slow, perilous collapse of the planet as ice shelves slid into the ocean. There had been sombre, reflective, tracks about obscure bodies of water in Orkney. They’d waxed lyrical about the virtues of being an EU citizen (pre-Brexit, naturally). The band have always embraced the miserable alongside the beautiful. Wilkinson is particularly complimentary of the game’s “strange sense of humour”, something he thinks resonated with the band – and their fans.The initial meeting between took place in Birmingham. “Birmingham is a strange place. Its own world. Very strong in character,” reflects Wilkinson. “Maybe [Kurvitz] had been to Alan Moore for a magical blessing? [To meet us] in the spiritual home of heavy metal and Tolkien’s inspiration for the Shire … it seems oddly fitting, I suppose, now that I look back. I had never thought about that until now.”Sea Power, new to the world of video games, took direction from Kurvitz, caught in the tidal pool of his vision for most of the project. Wilkinson tells me that Kurvitz had a plan, and “a fastidious knowledge of our albums and rare EPs and B-sides”. As such, many of the songs in the game come from pre-existing Sea Power tracks, reworked, remixed, and re-recorded to coalesce with the watercolour weariness that defines Disco Elysium’s fading world.View image in fullscreenThe game’s ‘thought cabinet’ … cover art for Disco Elysium’s soundtrack.Illustration: ZA/UM“Thinking about it, some of the tracks we used on the game continued their existence into our following album,” Wilkinson says. “So working on the game not only drew from our past but influenced our future, too.”Disco Elysium’s songs are stripped down, exposing the core melodies, and a little bit less dense than what you’d hear on a standard Sea Power album. There are fewer vocal melodies and longer, dreamier sequences. Any explicit narrative is stripped away, and you’re left with a soundscape, a Turner painting as a song. “Generally, songs needed distilling down to a fundamental mood fitting the scene, doing away with anything which was in competition with that mood and usually adding a little dreamy liminal menace,” Wilkinson says.“There is so much dialogue, and the visuals do so much, so the music really just needed to reach into the subconscious and open the gates of the mind, allowing the brain to absorb the words and images and help them become totally immersive. And that was enjoyable, artistically, to do … I love creating atmospheres and sonic textures as much as writing choruses or words. Maybe more, sometimes.”Sea Power have also worked on film soundtracks, rescoring a 1934 Irish fictional documentary called Man of Aran – an experience that helped Wilkinson know what to expect from creating a game soundtrack, even if there were some key differences.“Games are a little more easygoing with regards to timing,” he says. “With film, it’s often important to hit cues and you know exactly when different moods need to change direction. It can be more mathematical. The game needed more general mood textures to sit behind scenes, and blend into and enhance the feeling of various parts of the world. I would definitely work on more games. I love games like Disco Elysium, although they are a very rare thing.”This spring, Sea Power are embarking on a mini tour named Soundtracks Live. The set will feature various Disco Elysium songs, work from the Man of Aran soundtrack, and various tracks from another documentary feature film, From the Sea to the Land Beyond. Wilkinson is excited about the prospect of performing these tracks live – especially for an audience of Disco Elysium fans.View image in fullscreen‘The game needed general mood textures to sit behind scenes’ … Disco Elysium.Photograph: ZA/UM“We have had a noticeable growth in listeners since [the game was released],” he says. “They seem like a cool and thoughtful bunch, these Disco Elysium players. They are appreciated. The odd drunken detective has been sighted along the crash barrier at gigs.”The relationship between Disco Elysium and Sea Power has been symbiotic; they have given new life to each other. Sea Power have seen a swell in listeners as a result of the game, and existing Sea Power fans discovered a new love for video games as a result of the collaboration. And the relationship is still evolving.“On our first meeting, [Kurvitz] did tell me that he had worked very hard on re-ordering the track list to our album Valhalla Dancehall,” smiles Wilkinson. “Hmm, Valhalla Dancehall, Disco Elysium … could there be a link of some kind?” The band are now considering this revised track list for the album’s anniversary reissue. “He is very talented and intelligent. So are all the game’s core creators. I don’t think many people notice all the little nods to the world of Sea Power through the game. It was strange when it became such a huge hit around the world, and we were proud to be a part of its story.“And, of course,” he nods, “we got a Bafta out of it, too, which would have been unlikely to happen to us otherwise.”Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is available now on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

Because he’s high on his own supply of fake newsJonathan FreedlandAddicted to Fox News and outlets even more extreme, the president finds support and justification for actions disastrous to Americans and the worldFri 14 Mar 2025 12.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 12.54 EDTShareNot content with shattering the post-1945 international order, which delivered prosperity and power to his country for eight long decades,Donald Trumpis seemingly set on destroying the US economy. And he’s doing it because he, and the American right, have lost their ability to grasp reality.Start with the economic vandalism, unfolding in real time and mesmerising to watch. For weeks, you could see the US stock market falling and falling until on Thursday the S&P indexpassed an unwanted milestone: it stood more than 10% down from the peak it had reached less than a month earlier, a fall that meets the Wall Street definition of a “correction”. In other words, even if the market eventually rallies, this is no blip.The talk now is of a recession and you can tell that Trump himself suspects it’s coming. “I hate to predict things like that,” he saidthis week. “There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America … It takes a little time.” Did you catch that? The great booster, who campaigned on a promise to turn things around “on day one”, is now adopting the lotus position, talking of “transition” and urging patience.The source of the trouble is not mysterious. It is Trump himself. His actions since taking office less than two months ago have spooked investors. They crave stability but see a president who governs by whim. Those whims can change hourly – imposing a tariff after breakfast only to drop it before lunch. One minute it’s a50% levy on Canadian aluminium, the next it’s200% on European wine, only for one or the other to be binned within hours. It keeps Trump in the news, which he loves, but plays havoc with companies that have to plan for the long term. Confronted by chaos, they prefer to wait to see where things settle. That means orders on hold, workers without work, less money in everyone’s pocket.Add in a wild-eyed guy with a chainsaw taking chunks out of a federal bureaucracy that provides services that, for all theirAyn Randtalk of a minimal state, business leaders rely on – whether it’s schools, roads or air traffic controllers to keep planes in the sky – and you can see why the only surging number on Wall Street right now is the one that measures pessimism.To be clear, it’s not just the manic style of Trump andElon Muskthat’s causing alarm. Even if imposed calmly, tariffs are a prosperity killer. Trump may be their biggest advocate, but it’s clear he doesn’t understand how they work. He speaks as if the people paying them will be hated foreigners, the likes of China or Canada forced to pay billions into US coffers. When, in fact, tariffs are a sales tax levied on US consumers who have to pay extra for imported goods. A tariff on foreign cars, say, is not paid by Germany but by an American who buys a BMW. It drives prices up for Americans. When other countries hit back with tariffs of their own, making US products harder to sell, you’re in a trade war that only makes everything worse.Hence the current dread of stagflation, the grim combination of zero growth and rising inflation. The word was born in the Jimmy Carter era, but the Trumpcession will have bonus features all its own. When I spoke to Heather Boushey, who served as an economic adviser to the Biden administration, for the latestPolitics Weekly America podcast, she told me that Musk’s supremacy over so much of the federal government, even as he continues to run his own mega-businesses, is having one particular chilling effect. “Companies are looking at this and saying: ‘I can’t compete with an Elon Musk that’s in charge of the regulatory agencies, that’s going to do things only for himself.’ That’s going to stymie investment, it’s going to stymie innovation, and ultimately be terrible for the US economy.”View image in fullscreenA news report plays in the background as Donald Trump speaks to reporters onboard Air Force One, 14 September 2017.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersBoushey adds that Trump’s US will be less able to weather a recession, because the Trump-Musk cuts are stripping away so much of the infrastructure of support, cutting a combined total of more than$1tn from the Medicaid and food stampsprogrammes alone. When the storm hits, families will go hungry.It’s bad for the country and bad for Trump politically: the people most dependent on soon-to-be gutted government help such as Medicare or Medicaidare Trump voters. As the impact of the cuts kicks in – national parks closed during the summer, delayed benefits for veterans, a deadly accident, for example,in an area previously safeguarded– many Americans could sour on the president who promised to make their lives better. Especially when they see him go ahead with his signature policy:a $4.5tn tax cutthat will massively benefit the very richest.Why, then, is Trump pursuing a course of action that can only damage the country and dent his own standing? The explanation lies in the way Trump sees the world. Which is through a lens clouded by the very phenomenon he once did so much to identify: fake news.For most of the past decade, the focus has been on the likes of Trump and Musk as peddlers of falsehoods. There has been less attention paid to their role as consumers of lies. And yet it’s long been clear that Musk is spending too much time on X and is getting extremely high on his own supply. Witness his credulous swallowing of all kinds offar-right rubbish about Britain.Trump is scarcely any better, believingprovable nonsenseabout Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s poll ratings being in the single digits, when in fact the Ukrainian leader’s numbers are much better than his, to pick just one instance of Trump putting aside the briefings he could have from the world’s best-resourced intelligence agencies and preferring to gobble up internet slop instead.It’s a function of Trump not shifting his core views in decades – he was banging on about tariffs in the 1980s – and being, as Zelenskyy memorably put it, “trapped” in a “disinformation bubble”. It consists of the team of sycophants that now envelops him – the “adults in the room” of the first term are long gone – and whose message is reinforced when he meets the press: note how many of the supposed reporters whom Trump encounters are, in fact, representatives frompro-Trump outletsso slavish they make Fox News look like Edward R Murrow.A president touting Musk’s cars from the White House shows this: the Tesla boycott really irks him | Gaby HinsliffRead moreThe result, saysone longtime Trump watcher, is that “he’s more sheltered from outside information than he ever has been before”. Like Saddam Hussein in his bunker as US forces approach the palace, he is being told that tariffs made the US rich in the 19th century and will do so again, that Elon Musk is popular and that the people are grateful to their leader, even when the economy is nosediving. Inside the info-bubble, any contrary voice can be dismissed, even if it requires acrobatics to do it. Trump’s latest target is the Murdoch-owned, conservative Wall Street Journal, which dared point out the dangers of a trade war:Trump counteredthat the “globalist” WSJ was “owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union”. Inside the bubble, there is no room for truth: it must be kept out by lies.For now, and armed with the loudest megaphone on the planet, the US president can keep reality at bay. But eventually, Americans will be able to see with their own eyes and in their own lives what Trump has done to the US and the wider world. Their daily experience will expose him for what he is: a confidence trickster who has made them poorer and less safe.

He holds a green card, giving him permanent residence status, and is married to a US citizen. They are expecting their first child soon. Immigration agentsarrested him last weekin his university housing and sent him for detention from New York City to Louisiana. He had been aleader of protestsagainst Israeli war crimes in Gaza.Beyond that, the facts are contested. His friendscalled him“kind, expressive and gentle”. A Columbia professordescribedhim as “someone who seeks mediated resolutions through speech and dialogue. This is not someone who engages in violence, or gets people riled up to do dangerous things.”Deporting speakers over supposed ‘propaganda’ is a stock authoritarian move | Sarah McLaughlinRead moreBut Donald Trump, hailing his arrest,suggestedKhalil was among students “who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity”. The administration has presented no facts to back up these assertions, but even were it to do so, the suggestion that permissible speech can be a basis for deportation is deeply troubling. Trump vowed more such deportation efforts.Ordinarily, the first amendment protects even offensive speech. Although the government retains greaterlatitudeto deport non-citizens, Trump’s rhetoric suggests an intention to step way over the line of propriety. What does it mean to be “anti-American”? As we saw during theMcCarthyera, people can face that accusation for a wide range of legitimate political views. Such campaigns are the antithesis of the free debate that is essential for US democracy.As for the charge of “antisemitism”, Trump seems to be fueling a disturbingtendencyto use claims of antisemitism to silence criticism of the Israeli government. Antisemitism is a serious problem that threatens Jews around the world. But if people see accusations of antisemitism as mere efforts to censor critics of Israel, it would cheapen the concept at a time when the defense against real antisemitism is urgently needed.Even Trump’s unsupported suggestion that Khalil is “pro-terrorist” needs unpacking. To begin with, opposing Israel’s indiscriminate and disproportionateattackson Palestinian civilians, as well as its starvation of them, does not make anyone pro-terrorist. Israel is required to carry out its military response to Hamas’s appalling murders and abductions of 7 October 2023 in accordance with international humanitarian law. War crimes by one sideneversupport war crimes by the other. Pointing that out, if that’s what Khalil did, does not make him “pro-terrorist”; it makes him pro-civilian.Trump’s efforts to censor criticism of Israeli misconduct is a recipe for endless war and atrocitiesThe Trump administration’s retaliation against Khalil is part of its larger attack on campus protests against Israeli war crimes in Gaza. Just days earlier, the administration announced thewithdrawalof $400m in federal funding from Columbia for supposedly failing to protect Jewish students and faculty during anti-Israel protests, the vast majority of which were entirely peaceful. Other universities have now been threatened with a similar suspension of their funding.Coincidentally, I spoke on the Columbia campus days before Khalil’s detention. As a Jew, I did not feel the least bit threatened. Indeed, many of the protesters against Israeli atrocities have been Jewish. Again, Trump’s pretext for censoring critics ofIsraelis transparently thin.If we tolerate an Israel exception to our rights of free speech, we can be sure that other exceptions will follow. Trump likes to half-jokingly refer to himself as a “king”. Are we heading toward a Thailand-stylelèse majestéunder which criticism of the king is criminalized?But censoring criticism of Israel is a poor strategy even for protecting Israel. Trump’splanto “solve” Israel’s Palestinian problem by forcibly deporting millions of Palestinians would be a hugewar crime; it has been rightlyrejectedby the Arab states that Trump envisioned receiving the refugees or later paying to rebuild Gaza.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Another option would be to recognize the “one-state reality” created by Israel’s illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, but the Israeli government refuses to provide equal rights to all residents. Roughly the same number of Jews and Arabs like between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, so Israel would lose its Jewish majority.The most realistic, legal and enduring option remains a two-state solution, an Israeli and Palestinian state living side by side in peace. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has devoted his political career to avoiding a Palestinian state, but it is the best prospect for lasting peace.In pressing Netanyahu to agree to the current temporary ceasefire inGaza, Trump showed his capacity to exert pressure on the Israeli government to take steps toward peace that it resists. He could do the same for a two-state solution.But to build a political support for this important step, we need free debate in the United States. Trump’s efforts to censor criticism of Israeli misconduct is a recipe for endless war and atrocities. Free speech is required if we hope to do better.

The press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, claimed Khalildistributed“pro-Hamas propaganda”. A White House officially reportedlyaddedthat the “allegation here is not that he was breaking the law”. Their actions are not about conduct, but speech.Trumphimself claimed Khalil’s arrest was “the first of many to come” against students engaging in “pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity”.Americans must ask ourselves whether we are comfortable with our government wielding its power to deport speakers for what it claims is pro-terrorist propaganda. If your answer is “yes”, you should know this method is often employed by authoritarian governments with significantly weaker national commitments to free expression than our own.Should we approve of the use of government power to expel speakers whose political views the government loathes?In recent years, India has increasingly canceled or failed to renew the work visas of journalists in the country whose writing has challenged the government, including one whosereporting“crossed the line” and another, married to an Indian citizen, whocreateda “biased negative perception about India” through her journalism. Officials are alsotargetingthe overseas citizenship of India (OCI) status, available to certain individuals of Indian origin or married to Indian citizens, while it takes aim at those it accuses of “tarnishing the image” of India.These denials serve multiple purposes: they not only diminish government critics’ ability to speak but they also limit the viewpoints that citizens of those countries can access – and warn everyone else to shut up.Similar efforts are under way elsewhere.Russia’s targeting of the press, especially after its invasion of Ukraine, has included theexpulsionof foreign journalists including Politico’s Eva Hartog andEl Mundo’s Xavier Colas. Hong Kong authoritiesrefused to renewthe visa of Rowena He, a scholar and Tiananmen massacre researcher, resulting in her removal from the city and her job at Chinese University of Hong Kong. Kuwaitrevokedcitizenship from the blogger and critic Salman al-Khalidi and has since in absentia convicted him for social media posts andextraditedhim from Iraq. Thelistgoes on.Prosecutors seek to move Mahmoud Khalil’s deportation case to LouisianaRead moreGovernments retain significant authority over who can enter and reside within their borders. But that authority should not be used as a weapon to reflect the government’s preferred political opinions or sift out their critics. Unfortunately, in many places, it is, often on the basis of spurious national security-related claims.The question at hand today is not whether Khalil’s views are popular or beloved among American citizens or politicians. That should never be the question we ask in our most challenging questions about our speech rights. What we must ask instead is: should we approve of the use of government power to expel speakers whose political views the government loathes?Because, through its many comments about Khalil’s case, that is the question theTrump administrationhas undoubtedly posed to us. If constitutionally protected speech “adversarial” to the political positions of the US and allies can make Khalil eligible for deportation, this administration is ultimately threatening the authority to revoke the status of any lawful immigrants whose views it dislikes. You don’t need to hold any sympathy for Khalil’s views to see why this is an immense threat to free expression.Here in the United States, I advocate for the rights of international students originating from authoritarian regimes who study on our nation’s campuses and carry fear that research or political activity challenging their governments will create consequences at home. Now, immigrants legally in the United States on either a green card or a student visa may be forced to make some of the same calculations as those who live or work in authoritarian states abroad – but about our own government.Is it safe for me to speak my mind? Is it worth the risk? Is the government going to target me for my views?America’s immigration holding cells should not become detention centers for speech the government intends to target.Sarah McLaughlin is senior scholar on global expression at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and author of the forthcoming bookAuthoritarians in the Academy: How the Internationalization of Higher Education and Borderless Censorship Threaten Free SpeechExplore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilOpinionCensorshipDonald TrumpTrump administrationMigrationUS immigrationIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

Don’t look, don’t sell, hold your nerve on the assumption it’ll be fine in 10 years’ time, just as the markets recovered eventually and ebulliently after the 2008 crash and Covid. In the meantime, let’s console ourselves with the silver lining that Elon Musk found himself personally$22.8bn the pooreron Monday, as Tesla’s share price plummeted. Even more gratifying: unlike the overall market losses, Musk’s losses were at least in part caused by personal animus.The backlash against Musk has been growing in recent weeks, driving down Tesla sales, with the car’s dealerships and drivers becoming targets. Sheryl Crow sold hers. The actor Jason Bateman said that driving a Tesla was tantamount to rocking a Trump sticker on your bumper. And with each passing week, more protestersgatheroutside Tesla showrooms across the US. Meanwhile, individual owners have discovered that the cost of driving a car that once symbolised wealth and status is beingcalled a Naziin supermarket car parks. A nice Subaru, anyone?TuesdayTen days after Meghan Markle’s new show,With Love, Meghan, dropped on Netflix there are still questions to answer: primarily, is her insistence on calling herself Sussex strictly in line with protocol? And, by correcting the misuse of her name, was she pass-agg bullying her episode two guest, Mindy Kaling?For my money, Kaling, who appeared on the show to cut heart-shaped sandwiches like the drippy friend in a Jane Austen novel, knew exactly what she had signed up for and no sympathy is due. But reviewing the footage, it’s clear she really did trigger her host’s irritation. “It’s so funny that you keep saying Meghan Markle,” says Meghan – it’s the “keep” in that sentence where the poison is stored – not sounding amused at all. Kaling’s face went full rictus like she’d farted in front of the queen.Opinions differ as to whether Sussex is the correct surname for Markle, as opposed to Wales, Windsor or Mountbatten, and even after the New York Timesput a team on it, the proper answer remains obscure. While one royal expert said Meghan was either totally oblivious to what her actual name was or she didn’t understand it, another averred that Sussex was “totally within royal protocol”.

The woman, Sam Jones, who identifies as an influencer, snatched a helpless marsupial from its mother’s arms and held it aloft for the camera for lolz. In a since deleted post on a now-private Instagram, Jones, who previously posted images of herself with animals she had slain while hunting, exclaims: “I caught a baby wombat!”There are laws against this kind of thing in Australia and with the directness we expect from that part of the world, Tony Burke, the Australian home affairs minister, said: “I can’t wait to see the back of this individual.” (By the end of the week, she had left the country). But it was the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who really rose to the occasion and, in a political moment up there with “she was the people’s princess”, addressed Jones directly to say what everyone was thinking: “Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there.”View image in fullscreenDigested photo: ‘Let’s see how they cope when we cut off their maple syrup supply.’Photograph: Dave Chan/AFP/Getty ImagesThursdayIn animal news closer to home, I’m helping a friend buy kittens, and who knew that the market was so weird? My friend’s first instinct was to go through the cat charities, but none of them had new litters available. Next, she looked at the fancy breeders, where pure ragdolls and Bengals can go for £1,200 a piece. At the far end of the scale was the sketchy kitten market online, where people breed litters in their spare rooms or sell them on from illegal kitten farms.The middle path is an online animal exchange where measures are taken to verify users and buyers are warned against breeders who can’t produce the mother. Here’s the wild bit: since Covid, demand for pets in some parts of the country continues to outstrip supply and ordinary tabbies in London can go for £500 a pop and get snapped up within moments of going online – something you would avoid if you weren’t at the sharp end of your children’s relentless campaigning.

Unlike the boos for Pence, which were alleviated by counter-cheers, the boos for Vance were solid, sustained, and compounded with derisive whistling, supercharged by the fact Trump fired the Kennedy Center’s chair and replaced 13 of its trustees with his own people, and accompanied by a gratifying visual: that of extremely well-heeled seniors, the Kennedy Center’s constituency, lobbing catcalls for what looked like the first time in their lives.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

In a Trumpian world, Ireland must finally commit to its own securityFri 14 Mar 2025 07.40 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 12.18 EDTShareThe arrival of Trump 2.0 in the White House has disrupted the foreign and defence policies of all states and shattered existing paradigms of world order. Political leaders across the globe are having to assess how they respond to this more unpredictable and precarious world. ForIreland, the task is all the more difficult because the country’s core geopolitical anchors – the US and EU – are under stress.Donald Trump’s Maga policy challenges Ireland’s political economy, which relies on extensive US investment. Although cordial, taoiseach Micheál Martin’s recent meeting with Trump in the Oval Office provided the US president with the opportunity to level the charge that Ireland “took”the US’s pharmaceutical companies, and that the US now wants them back. Moreover, Ireland is not insulated from the tensions surrounding the emerging trade war between the US and the EU. At the same Oval Office meeting, the taoiseach had to sit and listen to a tirade against Europe, in which Trump claimed the EU was “set up in order to take advantage of the United States”.Ireland’s European anchor is under strain because of the shift in the transatlantic relationship and the growing urgency of the EU’s focus on its defence and security. As one of the three remaining EU member states that are neutral, Ireland is out of sync with most ofEurope. Austria, the other comparable neutral left (Finland and Sweden joined Nato in 2023 and 2024 respectively), spends far more on defence than Ireland, even though it does not need a navy.Ireland will hold the presidency of the EU council of ministers during thesecond half of 2026but it is an outlier because of its low spend on national security. In 2024, Ireland’s defence budget was€1.29bnor 0.24% of its GDP, thelowest in Europe. The Irish army and navy are way below strength because of difficulties in recruitment and retention. Decades of political neglect of security have left Ireland defenceless.Trump accuses Ireland of stealing US companies in meeting with taoiseachRead moreYet Ireland’s benign geographical location, despite cyber-threats and threats to theundersea cablesthat run through Irish waters, crowds out rational debate on defence and the deployment of Irish forces overseas. While the EU agenda is focused on rearming Europe and providing support to Ukraine, the Irish parliament is debating something calledthe “triple lock”.This was part of a package of legal measures introduced in 2001 to reassure voters about neutrality after they voted toreject the EU’s Nice treaty. It means that the deployment overseas of more than 12 Irish troops for peacekeeping requires the approval of the government, the Dáil, and the UN. This gives the permanent members of the security council a veto over the deployment of Irish forces.Following a wide-rangingpublic consultation on its foreign and securitypolicy in 2023, the government signalled that it intended to reform the triple lock. The current coalition headed by Martin is pressing ahead withlegislation to remove the need for UN authorisation.This has metvociferous oppositionin parliament from all parties on the left, including Sinn Féin.Their argumentis that the mechanism is fundamental to Irish neutrality and that its removal could be a precursor to Nato membership or involvement in a European army. The government has a solid parliamentary majority, so the triple lock will go, but not without a fight.Abolishing the triple lock will not come close to removing the multiple challenges Ireland faces in the current international security climate. In fact, the Irish debate appears to be taking place on another planet from the rest of Europe, given the speed at which events are evolving.Ireland is playing catchup and relentless assertions that the country is neutral offer no protection from strategic threats. After attending the 2025 Munich security conference, where they heard US vice-president JD Vance’s extraordinary attack on liberal democracy in Europe, Martin and the deputy prime minister Simon Harris are aware that maintaining the status quo will not suffice.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Irish navy form a guard of honour ahead of the arrival of Pope Francis, in Dublin, Ireland, 25 August 2018.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersThegovernment is seriousabout addressing the weakness of the national defence capability with more spending. It set up an independentcommissionto conduct a year-long review of the defence forces. The commission reported in February 2022, just before the epoch-changing Russian invasion of Ukraine. The report sketched three levels of ambition, the first being the current capability, or “business as usual”; the most ambitious being “level-three conventional” capability, which would require a significant upgrade to annual spending of €3bn.In 2023, the government committed to a middle path, level-two enhanced capability by 2028, gradually increasing defence spending by50% to €1.5bn. But in government circles there is now an awareness that this is not enough. The capital allocation to the defence sector is likely to be increased in July. But, remarkably, this is being done without thenational security strategythat was supposed to have been published in 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ireland needs to deepen its engagement with the EU’s defence initiatives and cooperate more closely with Nato if it is to enhance its defence capability. But domestic opposition could limit or prevent both.If there is an enduring transatlantic rupture, stand-alone European security structures will be created and Ireland will have to decide on its place, if any, in these structures. Given the EU solidarity Ireland received during Brexit negotiations, expectations of reciprocal solidarity will be hard to meet if Ireland remains on the sidelines.If a European common defence is at some future date agreed, Ireland’s participation will be put to the people in a referendum. Public opinion today would reject this, but one cannot predict what will happen given the fluidity of geopolitics.For now, Ireland will retain its formal status as a neutral state, but it may struggle to maintain its significance in the EU.Brigid Laffan is an Irish political scientist and emeritus professor at the European University Institute in FlorenceExplore more on these topicsIrelandOpinionDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Most of it is boring, unsexy and, at best, modestly incremental from day to dayFri 14 Mar 2025 06.04 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 15.52 EDTShareDonald Trumpis attempting to dismantle American constitutional democracy before our eyes. For the past six weeks, many of us have been telling ourselves we have to do something about this before it’s too late. And yet many people who feel this way – no matter how outraged they are or how genuinely worried they are about our country’s future – are doing very little but handwringing and doomscrolling.Elected leaders in theDemocraticparty are mostly failing to provide inspiration for people who are alarmed about the president’s actions. The protest paddles theyheld up at Trump’s speechbefore a joint session of Congress underscored the fact that they’re flailing more than they’re leading. Meanwhile, for most of us, the chance to vote again is almost two years away.The problem isnotthat there aren’t meaningful things ordinary people can do. There isstrong evidencethat protesting, calling our elected representatives and even just talking with people about our political concerns can create change. Fighting back against Trump’s naked power grab requires a whole “ecosystem of resistance”, as Sherrilyn Ifill, a law professor and former president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, recently put it. Each bit of that ecosystem adds up to more than the sum of its parts.The Guardian view on Trump and media: attention is power. Can Democrats grab it? | EditorialRead moreThe question isn’t whether there are meaningful steps to take. It’s why we don’t take them more often.The work of making change is difficult. Most of it is boring, unsexy and, at best, modestly incremental from day to day. But if asked to describe a success story of political change – for example, the1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which is widely credited with paving the way for the 1964 Civil Rights Act – what comes to mind is an image of hundreds of thousands of people gathered together in a triumphant, decisive moment. Images like these can be inspiring, but they can also cloud the imagination. What doesn’t always come to mind are the thousand small steps that led to that moment and carried the work forward the day after.An anti-incrementalism bias keeps many of us from taking action. As the economist Albert Hirschmanput it: “It is the poverty of our imagination that paradoxically produces images of ‘total’ change in lieu of more modest expectations.” The thing about modest expectations, though, is that they have a way of being met. Then they can grow a little. Then grow a little more. And before you know it, diseases such as smallpox are eradicated, global poverty has plunged and the average human lifespan has doubled.One reason we resist incrementalism is because we mistakenly think it requires tolerating injustice, such as moderating on an issue like transgender rights in an effort to court swing state voters. But embracing incrementalism doesn’t determine whether you are a moderate, a liberal, a progressive or a radical. Incrementalism is about the means with which we achieve change, not the ends we seek. No matter one’s goals – growinglocal support for clean energy projects,persuading elected representativesto consider proportional representation or evenamending the constitution– change requires small steps, each one pushing a bit further beyond the status quo.Activists, organizers and other social change entrepreneurs are frequently incrementalists, even if they don’t say so. For example, members of the Black Panther party were no milquetoast moderates, yet they were serving breakfast to kids each morning in Oakland starting in 1969. Their work expanded to similar programs across the nation, which eventuallyinspiredthe federal school breakfast program, which now feeds millions of kids. Love or hate the Panthers, they showed up day after day, knocking on doors, gathering signatures, planning budgets, making the coffee.The same is true for successful public policy. In most cases, incremental steps – such asratcheting up social securitythrough successive revisions over decades – are the most efficient path to transformative change. Whatever one’s goals, there’s no avoiding “doing the work”.Another barrier to incrementalism is how easy social media makes it to put off doing the work while simultaneously helping us feel as ifwe’re actually doing it. In a survey from 2018, the political scientist Eitan Hershfoundthat one-third of respondents reported spending at least two hours a day reading, discussing and thinking about political news. Yet virtually none of these people spent any time working or volunteering for a political organization. Hersh worries that too many of us, especially on the left, misunderstand what politics is – or, at least, what it’s actually for. As he wrote in a 2020 essay for the Times: “Politics is about getting power to enact an agenda. It’s about working in groups to turn one vote into more than one vote, one voice into more than one voice, by getting others on board with you. If you aren’t doing that, you aren’t doing politics. But hey, congratulations on your interesting hobby.”Other barriers to embracing incremental change run deeper: imagine two city governments, each of which sets a goal for policing reform. Their goals are basically identical, but government A gets much closer than government B to the target, even though neither of them reaches it. In a 2022 paper titledLosing Sight of Piecemeal Progress, the psychologist Ed O’Brien shows that, once a threshold for success is clear, people often lump nearly complete failures together with partial successes as “all the same”. Even though government A made real progress compared with government B, we’re liable to discount its efforts if they don’t result in total success. Worse, O’Brien shows that when we chalk up partial progress as failure, we lose motivation to keep working for change.Some climate activists worry that we’ll apply the same logic to the goal of keeping global warming under 1.5C. Indeed, theclimate crisisdemonstrates what is perhaps the greatest barrier to incrementalism: if we don’t know about progress, why would we doggedly keep working for it? Per capita, greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are currently down to 1920s levels. Annually, our country now emits about what we did in the 1980s. But as Hannah Ritchie discusses in her bookNot the End of the World, when asked whether emissions have increased, decreased or stayed the same in the US over the past 15 years, only one out of five people correctly say they’ve decreased. This lack of awareness of partial victories can breed cynicism and despair.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Even as progressives recoil at this rollback of rights, they should learn from how this political goal was accomplished.Acknowledging partial success isn’t tantamount to complacency. While the United States and other countries have made important progress on the climate crisis, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, paving the way for a tremendous amount of suffering. Yetnotacknowledging partial success is a recipe for inaction. It leaves us with the idle hope for a moment of liberation, delivered on the wings of a social change angel who doesn’t exist.What’s giving me hope nowWhat gives me hope is the unoriginal, even banal thought that most people are trying to be decent, most of the time. Of course, that leaves a lot of room for bad things to happen. We can do terrible things to one another under the misapprehension that we’re doing good. We’re biased about how, and to whom, we extend our decency. And the indecent few can manipulate the many to look away while they steal and plunder. But justice wouldn’t be possible if most of us didn’t care about it, however fallibly we pursue it. And most of us do, I think.Michael Brownstein is professor and chair of philosophy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and professor of philosophy at the Graduate Center, Cuny.

The latest started on Monday, whenElon Musktorched Trumpism by trumpeting the need tomake cuts in federal entitlement programs.He did not clearly say whether or how those cuts would affectMedicaid,Medicareand social security benefits. But he was clear that those programs will be on his target list.Entitlements are “the big one to eliminate,” he told Larry Kudlow, an economic adviser duringDonald Trump’s first term, on Fox Business Network. “Maybe half a trillion or $600, $700bn a year.” Speaking about why he’d focus on entitlements, he claimed: “The waste and fraud in entitlement spending, which is most of the federal spending, is entitlements, so that’s the big one to eliminate.”Throughout the 2024 campaign, the presidentpromised not to cut social security and Medicare benefits. Even so, Musk appeared to tee up changes to those programs.Elon Musk targeted me over Tesla protests. That proves our movement is workingRead moreHe called entitlements “a mechanism by which the Democrats attract and retain illegal immigrants by essentially paying them to come here and then turning them into voters”.“That’s why,” he continued, “Democrats are so upset about this situation. If we turn off this gigantic money magnet for illegal immigrants, then they will leave and they will lose voters.”As theAP notesin its report on the Musk-Kudlow interview: “The allegation echoed the ‘great replacement’ theory which claims that politicians are trying to expand their power by reshaping the country’s racial demographics.” Pinning the blame for entitlement cuts on undocumented immigrantsis a Trumpist wayof stoking the base, even as Musk lays the groundwork for making the lives of many Maga loyalists more difficult.The red meat Musk tossed to hardcore, anti-immigrant voters will not long be satisfactory if he follows through on cuts to programs on which many of them depend. In addition, Musk’s musings about entitlements will drive home the widening split between itsplutocratic and populist wings.Last month, Steve Bannon,representing the populist wingof the Maga movement,gave a taste of what is to comein Trumpland when he warned that Republicans making cuts to Medicaid would affect members of Trump’s fan club.As theNew Republicputs it: “On the Thursday episode of War Room, while gushing over massive government spending cuts, Bannon warned that cutting Medicaid specifically would prove unpopular among the working-class members of Trump’s base, who make up some of the 80 million people who get their healthcare through that program.”“Medicaid,” Bannon warned, “you got to be careful, because a lot of Maga’s onMedicaid. I’m telling you, if you don’t think so, you are deeeeeead wrong. Medicaid is going to be a complicated one. Just can’t take a meat ax to it, although I would love to.”And it is not just Medicaid that has strong support. Polls have “consistently shown that the American public strongly supports social security, across party and demographic lines”, per theNational Academy of Social Insurance.A 2024 surveyfound“87 percent of Americans agree that social security should remain a priority for the nation no matter the state of budget deficits, and this support holds strong across party affiliation. Ninety per cent of Democrats, 86% of Republicans, and 88% of independents support keeping social security a priority.”In the wake of the November election, a Pew surveyreported: “Republicans and Democrats have long differed over the size and scope of government, and that continued that continued in this election cycle.” But “large majorities of Trump (77%) and Harris supporters (83%) opposed any reductions in the social security program.”The president prepared the way for Musk’s remarks during his recent address to Congress when hedelivereda litany of false claims about people receiving social security benefits well beyond anyone’s capacity to live. Musk followed suit with what he said about undocumented immigrants getting federal entitlement benefits.The fact is that if they work, they pay into the social security system, but theyare not eligible to receive benefits. As KFF, a health policy research, polling and news organization,explains: “Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in federally funded coverage including Medicaid, Chip, or Medicare.”We got a glimpse of the trouble that Musk caused in Magaworld when, the day after his remarks, the White House tried to clean up the mess. Itissueda press release saying: “The Trump administration will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits. President Trump himself has said it (over and over and over again).”Then, never missing a chance to bash the media, the White House insisted: “Elon Musk didn’t say that, either. The press is lying again.” The press release also insisted that Musk was only talking about plans to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse.The ADL and the Heritage Foundation are helping to silence dissent in America | Ahmed MoorRead moreThe Musk-led assault on the federal government may talk a lot about doing so, but that is a cover for a bigger project. As professor Jack Schneiderobserves: “We all know that there are ways our government could become more efficient or more effective. But this project isn’t really about trimming the fat – it’s about cutting you loose.”The Trump-Musk projectis also designedto cripple government agencies, deprive government of the funds it needs to deliver necessary services, and further erode the public’s trust in government.That is why Musk has not been shy about denigrating the entire social security system,callingit a “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all times”. The White House effort to whitewash Musk’s faux pas is another example of the continuing saga of its baffling inability to get its story straight.The president may think that he gets more than he loses from his “billionaire in a china-shop” sidekick. But, in the end, while Trump may survive his association with the Musk, Trumpism may not.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 hundred books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionTrump administrationUS MedicareMedicaidUS politicsDogeDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Among them,Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based OpportunityandEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.” According to theLeadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, among the things these orders direct the administration’s agencies and staff to do are:Terminate diversity, equity, and inclusion offices, positions, and programs in the federal government; terminate equity-related grants and contracts; and repeal prior executive orders designed to ensure equal opportunity in the workplace, including a decades-old executive order from the Johnson Administration ...”In the art scene these moratoriums had almost immediate consequence.Cheryl Edwards, a visual artist and curator based in Washington DC, had been working on an exhibition titled Before the Americas which was to be mounted at the Art Museum of the Americas, a cultural venue managed by the Organization of American States (OAS), an organization established in 1948 that includes all 35 independent nations of the western hemisphere. In 2021 Edwards was approached by the current museum director, Adriana Ospina, and the previous director, Pablo Zúñiga, to, in her words, curate an exhibition to include African American artists in the DC area. They agreed on a framework engaging the question “Because we are people in a society that existed before slavery, how does that manifest itself in the work of artists in this area and the work of artists in their collection?” She was given a budget of $20,000 (with a $5,000 curator’s fee), the money being allocated by the previous US ambassador to the OAS under Joe Biden, Francisco O Mora. Edwards’s show was scheduled to open on 21 March, but she was informed by Ospina on 6 February that her show was “terminated”.Edwards attests this happened“because it is DEI”.Culture wars: Trump’s takeover of arts is straight from the dictator playbookRead moreSimilarly,Andil Gosine, a Canadian artist and curator, who is also a professor of environmental arts and justice at York University in Toronto, invested several years into an exhibition at the same museum. His show, titled Nature’s Wild with Andil Gosine, was essentially a collaborative project with 50 artists, writers and technicians exploring the themes he had examined in hisbook of the same title. It was to include artwork by a dozen artists from across the Americas, many of them LGBTQ+ people of color. He received a phone call from Ospina on 5 February informing him that the show had been canceled, despite none of the funding for it coming from OAS (that came from Canada Council). For him that that was “heartbreaking news”. He says: “This is the most time, money and heart I’ve put into anything. This was going to be the pinnacle of my last 15 years of work in the arts.”View image in fullscreenAndil Gosine – Magna Carta (2024).Photograph: Courtesy of the artistWith his background in international relations (working at the World Bank after graduate school) Gosine understood that the museum’s response had to do with fear of losing their budget by showcasing queer artists in the wake of yet another executive order, this one promising a process of “Reviewing United States Support to all International Organizations”. He explains: “This is a content question, a gamble on how to deal with a shifting political tide: to conform enough, sacrifice some people, sacrifice your values to survive, and then maybe not get the budget.” According tothe Congressional Research Service, in 2023 OAS had a budget of $145.2m, with the US contributing 57% of that. Having the United States rescind their support would clearly lacerate the organization’s operations. Nevertheless, Gosine thinks that their anticipatory acquiescence may be for nought. He asks how an organization that is fundamentally concerned with human rights and social justice can reinvent itself enough to mollify this vengeful and disdainful regime.The cancelation of art exhibitions negatively impacts the lives of curators, but these executive orders have an even more corrosive effect on the lives of artists – particularly those whose immigration status is in flux. Erika Hirugami, a formerly undocumented Mexican-Japanese immigrant, doctoral candidate at UCLA, and Los Angeles-based curator who has been working in the arts for 10 years, told me that the pressures placed on immigrants impel them to erase themselves, anticipating law enforcement officials incarcerating and deporting them. She attests that she knows more than 80 artists who “are terrified because having an exhibition at a museum that says that this artist is undocumented signals a reality that generates a kind of violence”.To better understand this, it helps to think of the work of the French sociologistPierre Bourdieu, who extensively studied European art museum visitors in the 1960s, concerned with why most art museum visitor profiles seemed to be correlated with a certain socio-economic class. What he found was that given the proliferation of middle-class aesthetics throughout the museum, the majority of working-class people self-selected to not attend, feeling that the museum was not the place for them. He called this de facto rejection of the poor and working class “symbolic violence”, meaning a non-physical violence expressed through the imposition of social norms by a group with greater social power. Worse still, these norms are internalized by all social groups who come to believe that social hierarchy and inequality are natural and inevitable.View image in fullscreenArleene Correa Valencia – I’m Sorry.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistHirugami explains that for artists who are undocumented, this administration has sought to normalize living in fear. Practically this means that some artists now forgo being paid for their work for fear of having their means of remuneration traced. Thus, their labor goes unrecognized and unpaid. To protect themselves some artists, according to Hirugami, go “zero social”, making themselves digitally invisible by taking down their websites and social media pages.Arleene Correa Valencia, a formerly undocumented artist living in Napa, California, understands this dread. “There’s no handbook to how to lose that fear,” she says. Valencia was an enrollee in theDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program, and a college student during the previous Trump administration, when she was under almost constant threat of losing her scholarship and means of staying in the country legally. Even now, having achieved permanent resident status, she still worries. “I still feel like I’m very much a target, especially having come to my residency as a Dreamer. There is this feeling that I did it the wrong way.”Less than two months after taking charge of the federal government, Trump and his agents have devised ways to not only erase certain artists and certain types of art; but also to compel these artists to erase themselves, in the name of self-protection. This is exactly the opposite of their most essential work: to engage the public to experience their work and to move them toward transformation. What is a possible solution? Valencia turns toward her art. She says:My practice has changed in that now I’m more grounded in knowing that my people have this beautiful language of painting. And with that I also, tattooed my head to recognize, my Indigenous background and my connection to Mexico. This is the time where we have to make our markings known, not just on our bodies, but in our work, marks that are true to ourselves.”Indeed, it’s crucial to refuse the option of doing violence to oneself by denying those very aspects of the self targeted in the culture war being waged by this administration. To maintain who you are can be its own kind of victory.Explore more on these topicsArtDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The answer, obviously, is the one thing that usually can’t be had for love nor money, and that’s pimping out the presidential office for advertising purposes.Posing with Elon Muskbeside a scarlet Tesla parked on the White House driveway, Donald Trump announced that he was buying one of his friend’s cars despite not being allowed to drive for security reasons because: “I just want people to know that you can’t be penalised for being a patriot.” The billionaire currently chainsawing his way through so many ordinary federal workers’ jobs had, he said indignantly, been unfairly treated by people who inexplicably now seem to have turned against his cars.Unedifying as all this was, what’s interesting is that it suggests that for once both men are rattled.The once-reassuring idea that stock market jitters would be enough to rein Trump in is now fading fast: this week the presidentrefused to rule out a recession, suggesting only that there would be “a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big”. But it seems he does still care either about his friends losing money, or perhaps about the idea gaining traction that joining Team Trump does the opposite of making you great again. Tesla’sshare price has halved since December, with more than $800bn wiped off the company’s value thanks to sales in Europe nosediving. Musk’s social platform X hasshed usersfast in recent months, while the boss’s trade war seems to have cost his Starlink satellite business a$68m contractwith the Canadian province of Ontario. This is not, to put it mildly, how oligarchy usually works. Asked on Fox Business this week how he managed to run his companies while slashing the state, an unusually downcast-lookingMusk sighed“with great difficulty” before falling silent. It wasn’t exactly an advert for coming on board.Personally I’ve always had my doubts about consumer boycotts, which at best tend to make the non-buyer feel good without achieving very much and at worst hurt ordinary employees with no power to grant whatever the boycotter wants. But Magaworld evidently believes in them, judging by the wayBud Light’s sales plummetedafter it featured a trans influencer in a marketing campaign. And while there’s no justification for violence against car dealers, peacefully not buying stuff is the safest form of protest imaginable for anyone fearful of retaliation by this regime. You don’t have to risk getting arrested, fired or deported; you don’t even have to wave a placard. And for allTrump’s talk of campaigners“illegally and collusively” boycotting Tesla, you can’t be sued for not wanting to buy a car. That boycotts get under the president’s skin where nothing else – not court orders, not the barely disguised horror of old allies abroad – seems therefore to make a strange kind of sense. To a president who sees everything in terms of making money, it’s consumers who matter. And now their wrath is spreading well beyond Musk’s companies.In Sweden, Facebook groups have sprung upurging boycottsof big US brands from Coca-Cola to Nike and Airbnb.Two-thirds of Germanswould now rather avoid buying American where possible, according to a survey for the business newspaper Handelsblatt. In Denmark, amid widespread alarm overTrump’s threatto get Greenland “one way or another”, the country’s biggest grocery chain is reportedly tagging European-made products with a black star to help customers buy local, while Canadians have been furiously boycotting US brands ever since Trump first suggested he wanted to annex their country. Judging by a flurry of Reddit queries about what Canadian alternatives are available in the UK, meanwhile, some Brits may soon be starting to load up on maple syrup, McCain oven chips and extra strong Canadian bread flour (excellent for sourdough, apparently) in solidarity. While a translatlantic trade war is ultimately going to hurt smaller countries more than it hurts the US, it will not necessarily be pain-free for corporate America.‘I feel utter anger’: From Canada to Europe, a movement to boycott US goods is spreadingRead moreMore significantly, Europeandefence stocks have soaredover the last week on the assumption that European governments seeking to rearm in a hurry will be reluctant to buy US-made weapons systems: if Washington is no longer a reliable ally, relying on US spare parts and software updates looks like a potential security weakness. Meanwhile shares in the Franco-British satellite network Eutelsatare up sixfoldon rumours that European governments are looking foralternatives to Musk’s Starlink, and something of the same reverse Midas touch is now clearly blighting political as well as corporate brands associated with Trump. Pierre Poilievre, the rightwing populist who had been expected to demolish Canada’s Liberal party in this year’s elections, has seen hispoll lead evaporate. And in Britain, being tipped as a future Reform UK party leader by Musk seems, if anything, to have helpedend Rupert Lowe’s career. (Didn’t he know there is only ever room for one star in a Nigel Farage party?)It’s too early to tell, of course, whether Trump’s attempt to drum up business on his friend’s behalf will bring the Maga faithful flocking to the rescue of a beleaguered brand. But if they do decide en masse to trade their trucks in for Teslas, at least we can all enjoy the irony of the people otherwise most furiously resistant to electric cars being suckered into accidentally cutting their carbon emissions by a president whodoesn’t appear tobelieve in the climate crisis.

I’d readthe headlines. I knew what was ahead of me. I was apprehensive, but determined.Everyone dreads moving house. But asAustralia and the world facea crippling housing crisis, with rental affordability reachingall-time lows, the experience has become even more stressful.When I moved house five years ago, I got the first flat I applied for. We edged out one other couple who wanted it, and that was that – the deal was done. How times have changed.This time, amid one of the tightest rental markets Sydney has seen, the process of submitting applications was gruelling. There’s nothing quite so impersonal as a “your application was unsuccessful” email, while you imagine the competition moving their sofa and plants into the living room you wanted. Whilerental bidding is banned, you start to believe it’s rife as you are forced back to square one.Here’s why Australia should build more smaller houses rather than fewer big ones | Peter MaresRead moreAfter a month of searching, my housemate and I signed on the dotted line for a flat far superior than some of the ones we’d been passed up for. But the experience was made a little bit easier thanks to the people around me.Moving house in 2025 requires you to assemble an elite squadron of friends and family with the perfect combination of skills and stamina. The first is someone who knows what a good floor plan looks like and won’t scoff when you start talking about good light and the downsides of a south-facing balcony.Come house inspections, you will need someone with an objective eye. One step removed from the process, they can help weigh up the pros and cons, helping you work out what you can and can’t sacrifice. They can also point out red flags, or hidden benefits, and aren’t afraid to strike hot property off the list because it doesn’t feel right.Once you hit the real estate websites and set up new property alerts, things start to get real. Enter the master planner. As a voice of reason, this person knows what you want almost as intimately as you. They understand your weak points, when to push you and how hard. Best of all, they bring your new life into focus, mapping out routes to the local supermarket, to work, and the nearest coffee shop from any number of prospective homes. They strategise as if life depends on it. Thanks to this person, I know more streets, parks and bus routes in and out of my new locale than I’ll ever need.Gone are the days when a ‘good job’ gets you a house – and now we have the data to prove it | Greg JerichoRead moreThen comes moving day. The task of packing and throwing away, checking your fridge will fit in the hole and deciding whether to change energy providers begins. Generous friends offer boxes and bubble wrap, cars or muscles on move-in day.Two friends teased me for hoarding too many nice jars and canvas bags collected from around the world as they unpacked my boxes. But they also made my bed so I could go to sleep without worry, stored important nuts and bolts (and my swimmers) in their handbags so they wouldn’t get lost. In return, one scored an unopened bottle of gin I found in the cupboard.With multiple moves come practised hands. No one can ever hope to be as a deft as a piano removalist, but you better have dollies, trolleys and the confidence to back a van in and out of a cul-de-sac – thanks, Dad.Finally, it helps to have a great flatmate, who, despite my doubts, saw promise in bad photos, and convinced me to pay the deposit before I’d even stepped inside.

I hope notFri 14 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 14.32 EDTShareTwo tech-related things made me laugh this week. One was Donald Trump’s childlike exuberance at seeing the dash panel of a Tesla on the White House lawn, and his wondrous exclamation that “everything is computer”.The other was equally hilarious, also tied to politics. Keir Starmer stood up yesterday in Hull and said waste would be thrown by the wayside and the civil service would lose its bloat … thanks to thetransformative effects of AI.What I knew, and no one else did untilmy story for New Scientistwas published shortly afterwards, was that the prime minister was talking nonsense. I had seen the government’s AI-powered revolution first hand. And it was all hooey.With what is believed to be a world first use of freedom of information (FoI) laws for this purpose, I had obtained the interactionsPeter Kyle, the UK technology secretary, had with ChatGPT for his job. (The department Kyle heads had rejected an earlier FoI request because granting it ran the risk of unveiling his own personal conversations with ChatGPT.) If Kyle’s chats are any indication of what the AI revolution promises in government, then we’re in for a tough time.My knowledge of the UK’s podcast scene is what you would expect as a middle-aged white man who spends too much time on the internet – so even I could answer the question Kyle first posed to the chatbot:which podcastsshould he appear on to reach a wide audience.What Kyle asked next – which of the four podcasts ChatGPT had recommended had the most listeners – might have seemed like a sensible use of the generative AI tool, but it was also something that a quick Google could have solved in much the same time; and with fewer concerns that it was making up numbers like an overconfident Oxbridge graduate. AI “hallucinations” – the submission of false, incorrect or misleading results – remain a real and present fear with generative AI tools, and are alarmingly common. So too is the idea of mixing things up a little: recent BBC research showed AI tools such as ChatGPT gotmajor things wrongwhen summarising its reporting.As to the tech secretary’s query about why AI adoption is so slow in British small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), that was equally unenlightening. It isn’t a novel or original take to say that data protection laws, such as general data protection regulations (GDPR), may stymie the development of a technology that is subject to multiple lawsuits about data breaches and copyright risks. Nor – you would hope – is it beyond the civil service’s ken to understand that “many SMBs are unaware of these programs or find them difficult to navigate”, as ChatGPT solemnly told Kyle in point seven of a plodding 10-point treatise. “Not reassuring that a minister with a department of experts is using AI for these sorts of questions,” as onecritic put it.View image in fullscreenTechnology secretary Peter Kyle in Downing Street, London, 25 February 2025.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Rex/ShutterstockChatGPT was stronger at answering Kyle’s questions seeking simplified analogies for complicated concepts such as “quantum” or “antimatter” – though, as some social media commentators havepointed out, it’s a little worrying that Kyle felt the need to ask an AI chatbot for a definition of “digital inclusion”. Presumably he should know, as the person responsible for overseeing it?Release of technology secretary’s use of ChatGPT will have Whitehall sweatingRead moreI was generally surprised both by the comparative lack of interaction Kyle had had with ChatGPT, given he’s spent the past several months telling anyone with an audio recorder about his hankering for the technology, and by the sorts of questions he was asking. In fact, my response on seeing the interaction between AI and the minister at the sharp end of the government’s use and knowledge of it was: is this it? Is this the generative AI revolution we’re banking our future and our economy on?There are ways to harness AI in government for the public good. Churning through complicated data to unpick patterns that the human eye misses, for example; AI-powered drug discovery; deep research of the type that can add insights long forgotten or never previously thought about – these are all attainable wins.Quite how the government’s talk of AI’s promise and potential chimes with the reality of how it is used now is something the tech secretary will have to answer for himself. Perhaps he can ask ChatGPT for some help there, too.Chris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite AppDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There is much to consider – from cost and capacity to the behavioural changes that can boost efficiency. Here, Guardian readers make it easy by sharing their experiences and offering key pieces of advice for how to get the most out of it.How to maximise cost savingsSign up to a wholesale power price retailer so you can charge and export power when it’s financially advantageous. Also, if you have an EV, you can charge for free from solar, or buy super-cheap (under 10c/kWh) power from the grid when it’s windy, sunny and not too hot.– Mark, Woodend, VictoriaIt is unlikely that you will be entirely off the grid with a battery so I recommend hunting for the lowest possible grid electricity prices (what you pay) for when you need to draw off the grid, and don’t worry about the feed-in tariff (what the grid pays you for your surplus) as feed-in tariffs are always stupidly low and make no discernible difference to your bills.– Peter, Burrawang, NSWWe always keep 25% in backup; since installing the battery to our existing solar system we have saved $11,846.– Alan, Port Pirie, South AustraliaJoin a retailer that allows you to access the wholesale market, just like the big batteries. That way you can sell energy from your battery during price spikes for up to $17/kWh (yes, dollars not cents).– Søren, Canberra, ACTElectric v hybrid: which vehicle should you buy in 2025?Read moreConsider how much capacity you’ll needI have a 10kWh battery with micro inverters on the roof. Mostly off-grid now except for winter mornings. Will add more battery capacity later. We need 10kWh plus for a house with electric heating and cooling.– Alan, Murrumbeena, VictoriaBigger is better. I have 16kW and it is just enough to heat a well insulated house in winter.– David, Moe, VictoriaSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailGo big. I have a 22 kW solar system with 54 kW of battery storage and an EV. I have not paid a power bill since 2017. I am now around $10,000 a year better off. I charge the car at home overnight (I’ve never paid to charge it), on average 8 kW a charge. We abolished gas so the house is fully electric. We have no problem running air con and heating. Our house is 100 years old.– Anonymous, Brisbane, QueenslandShift your mindsetThe one thing to be aware of is that jumping into solar/battery needs a behavioural change. If you’re expecting a set-and-forget solution you will get a very small benefit from the whole thing. You need to check power prices during the day, when is a good time to sell, to charge from the grid when prices are low, to use your power-hungry appliances, etc. The mindset shift is critical, way before installing anything.– Jorge, Caringbah south, NSWTo ensure you are using only battery-stored power, monitor your use of appliances in the household to avoid drawing too much power at once. This can all be done in your phone app. For example, wait until the cooking of a meal on the stove is over before charging the electric car. This will prevent your system having to draw from the grid. In other words, don’t use too many appliances all at the same time.– Bruce, Fawkner, VictoriaResilience in rural areasMake sure you get a system that will power your house during a blackout, and not find out later that you have to pay more for that function.– David, east Gippsland, VictoriaWe live in a rural area with occasional power cuts that can last more than a week after a flood. Only a few battery systems can accept power from solar panels when there is a power cut. Resilience is very important to us, and such a system does allow one to disconnect from the grid in the future … provided there is also the capability to accept a generator input during an extended period of cloud. Our system is six years old, and doesn’t have that capability. If we are off the grid in cloudy weather for an extended period, we would use gas for cooking and eek out our limited power.– Bunny, Darkwood, NSWIt’s more about security for me – we have had some big blackouts. But I enjoy playing with the app, working out which appliances use the most power, and shifting them to sunlight hours.– Anonymous, Coromandel Valley, South AustraliaExplore more on these topicsEnergyChange by degreesEnergy efficiencyRenewable energySolar powernewsShareReuse this content"

Since sheconfirmed on Wednesdaythat she will not seek re-election as a MSP at next May’s Holyrood elections, ending a 27-year career in frontline politics, the Scottish media has overflowed with assessments of the legacy and greatest hits of the country’s first female and longest serving first minister.Although the decision came as no surprise, given her increasingly infrequent appearances at the Scottish parliament, her departure seems a good time to consider what she did and the imprint she has left on the recent history and future trajectory of her country.Having reported on Sturgeon for over a decade, I remember the deafening roars of the crowd at Glasgow’s 12,000-seater Hydro arena,which she sold out in 2014– like Lady Gaga and Beyoncé – a few weeks after her election as SNP leader. I remember a round table on energy policy, where she made sure that the only young woman in the room got a chance to speak. I remember her reddening face and wobbly lip last year as she struggled to contain her emotion under questioningat the UK Covid-19 inquiry.An introvert with down-to-earth charm, she was – and still is among many in the SNP and the wider Scottish public – adored, a progressive ally and advocate in private as well as public. Her greatest gift is the ability to speak human when all around her just look to be touting for votes.At the age of 54 – with eight years on our prime minister and still relatively young in terms of political careers – talk of legacy can feel premature. It is certainly fluid, with the Branchform inquiry into SNP finances,which saw her arresteda few months after she resigned as first minister in 2023, ongoing and her soon to be ex-husband, Peter Murrell,charged with alleged embezzlement.Since her announcement, posted on her current favoured social media platform, Instagram, the Holyrood opposition has taken the opportunity to cast her legacy as one dominated by division and failure. But that is less than half the story.Certainly Sturgeon benefited electorally fromthe Yes/No splitthat followed the 2014 referendum, with independence voters uniting behind the SNP, and supporters of the union split between other parties. It took another 10 years for the link between constitutional preference and ballot box to uncouple, resulting in the SNP’s catastrophic defeat in last July’s general election at the hands of a resurgent Scottish Labour. (Since then, Labour has squandered its advantage andthe SNP is leading the pollsfor Holyrood again.)But her own political standing suffered because of that same division – those who loved her were unwilling to hold her to account, while those who loathed her refused to acknowledge her many assets.It was this capacity to polarise that Sturgeon herself identified as one of her reasons for stepping down as first minister. But it was plain that she was also spent after a gruelling run of challenges, including the Covid pandemic, the Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government’s handling of sexual assault allegations against her predecessor Alex Salmond, and the controversy around her flagshipgender recognition reforms.Throughout the pandemic, Sturgeon was admired across the UK for her straightforward and reassuring communication, yet the UK Covid inquiry exposed a significant lack of transparency behind this, bypassing cabinet decision-making andmass deletion of informal messages. It underlined her hyper-controlled, presidential style of leadership and its brutal self-imposed toll, with Sturgeon unable to allow herself even a day off.With the Salmond inquiry – as with her husband and former SNP chief executive Murrell – some felt a woman was being unfairly held responsible for the alleged actions of a man – but self-evidently this woman was also in charge of her government and at the epicentre of party decision-making for decades. Likewise, both she and Murrell failed to recognise the almighty potential conflict that having a married couple at the head of a governing party represented.She was badly hurt by accusations of betraying feminism over her gender recognition reforms, which she could not have foreseen would coalesce around a global culture war when she first proposed them as a natural progression from theintroduction of equal marriage. But her refusal to entertain those, even within her own party, worried about the potential scope of self-identification left her exposed.Sturgeon herself has said the introduction of theScottish child payment, the expansion of free childcare and support for youngsters in care are among her proudest achievements. Critics point to failures to tackle the attainment gap or drug deaths, timidity in taking on vested interests over NHS reform, and also her unwillingness to build on the broad coalition gifted by the Yes movement after the referendum.Something that even admirers of Sturgeon have always wrestled with was the space between rhetoric and reality in the SNP government – or, as an anti-poverty campaigner said to me: “Does it matter that witches have been pardoned if you don’t know what you’re going to feed your child tomorrow?” Despite some excellent policy progress on violence against women and child poverty, for example, third sector leaders would highlight a significant implementation gap: like the extended childcare, which ended up a postcode lottery, with extra hours at work-unfriendly times.Speaking to younger activists, it’s clear that the sheer symbolism of Sturgeon’s tenure inspired generations. Her legacy is as much in what she made visible and normal. She proved it was possible to govern in an entirely different tone of voice from the Tory bombast at Westminster: speaking out against Trump, happily describing herself as a feminist, championing the transformative power of reading. She spoke too about miscarriage, the menopause, fostering – and while having a political leader talk about those topics on Loose Women is not a silver bullet to systemic inequality, it mattered.Nicola Sturgeon to stand down as MSP next yearRead morePerhaps it was inevitable that the first of her kind would end up unable to fulfil the weight of expectation. It is worth keeping in mind too that the party she led is united by its desire for independence, not centre-left social policy.For now,Sturgeon’s Instagram followerscan see her enjoying the “ordinary stuff that most people take for granted”, which she referenced in her resignation speech as having become increasingly out of her reach. Although for Sturgeon this involves hanging out with the tartan A-list, DJing with Hollywood star Alan Cumming and hosting books events with her old pal and crime-writing doyenne Val McDermid.Meanwhile, those obituary writers – me included – await the publication of her “deeply personal” memoir later this year with some anticipation about the revelations it may contain. I doubt these will be the last words to be written about a woman who continues to fascinate, infuriate, inspire and challenge even as she steps – for now – out of the limelight.Libby Brooks writes on Scotland for the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A sudden attack of frustration leads to a burst of machismo, achainsaw response. The system stinks. Slash the bureaucrats. Smash the machine.Thatcher had her “subversives”, Tony Blair his “scars on my back”, David Cameron his “enemies of enterprise”. Now Sir Keir Starmerclaims to be haunted by the blockers, checkers, regulators, bloaters. All are ganging up against the cry of his new friend, Donald Trump, togrow, baby, grow. So get going, chainsaw, do your job.Cuts on a scale mooted this week by Starmer, of NHS England and 25% in the administrative costs of regulation for businesses, have been achieved only once in modern times. That was under Cameron’s 2010 government,when almost 300 quangos were “bonfired”. But the chief cause was George Osborne’s savage austerity, cutting resources to local government by as much as a third. If that is Starmer’s intention, perhaps he should say so. As it is, the nearest he has got to Musk was to imitate his slashing of the US’s aid budget last month, which he did bydrastically cutting the UK’s own. It was a classic example of slash fast, count the bodies later.Whether the NHS cuts will prove as drastic as Starmer suggests remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Starmer has created a number of new quangos in the past year. We haveEd Miliband’s gargantuan GB Energy,the Independent Football Regulator and the surely satirical Regulatory Innovation Office. Also promised are more teachers, more carers, more border staff, not to mention more defence workers and soldiers. No chainsaw there, we assume.But nothing Starmer is proposing can come near the bureaucratic explosion planned by his deputy, Angela Rayner. Anyone who has attended planning seminars for the past decade is aware that British planning needs reform – sensitive reform. Yet in order to stifle opposition to her favouring developers eager for houses in the countryside – no one objects to them in towns – she is proposing a revolution. This is nothing short of a whole new layer of regional government, similar to the one tried and abandoned by her predecessor John Prescott.This is to take the form of what could be 30 “combined authorities” under elected “regional mayors”. These mayors will sit in headquarters over and above groups of existing local councils, merging with their neighbours into large ones. The intention is blatantly to eliminate mostly rural local councils that are most likely to oppose housing estates and developments such as pylons and solar arrays in the countryside. More than 164 district or borough councils seem likely to be abolished. I know of no country in Europe where such a crushing of individual village and town democracy could take place.Rayner is not shy about this. She declares it“a completely new way of governing”and nothing short of a constitutional upheaval. Yet there has been no inquiry or commission, no public debate. Theonly documentwas published last December, one of the most unreadable white papers I have seen. It showed no feel for the country it was dismembering, let alone for its countryside or nature. It might have been written one night in an Islington attic.View image in fullscreenAngela Rayner arrives at Downing Street for a cabinet meeting.Photograph: Thomas Krych/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockRayner’s mayors will be answerable not to any directly elected assembly, but to a council composed of leaders of their subordinate authorities. This council, with majority voting and a mayoral casting vote, will head a new civil service, its existential purpose being to implement central government policy. Rayner’s mayors will be “in the lead” on all matters of housing and planning. They will be free to alter local council boundaries. They will even be free to act as “default delivery institutions” should the councils fail to meet targets. Leaders of local councils of 500,000 people will merely have a vote in matters of local policy and administration. The document reeks of contempt for local democracy. It reeks of power to the centre.I wonder if Starmer knows the bureaucratic scope of this power. It will supposedly include acouncil of the nations and regions, a mayoral council, anational wealth fundand amayoral data council. They will execute anintegrated settlement, a spatial development strategy, aGet Britain Workingplan and a universal system of strategic planning, to mention a few. Starmer may be abolishing NHS England, but clearly no NHS official need be without a job.As for the reorganisation of the lower tier of local authorities, there is no evidence to suggest that big councils are more efficient or less bureaucratic than smaller ones. They are merely easier to control from above. The experience of recent changes in local government is also that reform costs millions and rarely delivers savings. Such costly upheavals must be the last thing local councils need just now, with abouthalf of councils in England reportedly near to bankruptcy.The superficial appeal of the Musk moment is that by breaking things it leaves room for renewal. That may be. But a civilised democracy subjects it to checks and balances. Dismantling the geography of English local government removes that check and replaces it with Whitehall. All Starmer’s chainsaw will slash is democracy.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourLocal governmentcommentShareReuse this content"

It is negligence towards today’s and future generations not to engage China on this critical topicFri 14 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 06.46 EDTShareThe climate crisis is an existential threat to our way of life in Britain. Extreme weather is already changing the lives of people and communities across the country, from thousands of acres of farmland being submerged due to storms such asBertandDarraghto record numbers of heat-related deaths in recent summers.The only way to respond to this challenge is with decisive action at home and abroad. Domestically, this government’s clean-energy superpower mission is about investing in homegrown clean energy so we can free the UK from dependence on fossil fuel markets while seizing the immense opportunities for jobs and growth.But climate action at home without pushing larger countries to do their fair share would not protect current and future generations. Emissions know no borders, and we will only protect our farmers, our pensioners and our children if we get other countries of the world to play their part.That is why this week I’m travelling to Beijing: to urge continued action from China, the world’s biggest emitter –responsible for about 30% of global emissions– to tackle the climate emergency. I will be meeting Chinese ministers for frank conversations about how both countries can fulfil the aims of the Paris climate agreement, to which both countries are signed up.China is responsible for more emissions than the US, EU, India and UK, yet I am the first energy secretary since 2017 to visitChina. Frankly, I consider it to be negligence towards today’s and future generations not to engage China on this topic. As the chancellor said before her recent trip, choosing not to engage with China is no choice at all.People often ask me why the UK should act on the climate crisis when we account for just1% of current global emissions. But the fact that we contribute just 1% of emissions isn’t an excuse to shrink from the global stage. It is an instruction for Britain to use our influence to build a global coalition to drive the action the world needs. It is only our domestic ambition, renewed by this government after years of failure by the last government, that gives us the credibility to compel others to act. This is about protecting the British people now and for generations to come.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of a tornado in Guangzhou, China, 28 April 2024.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesOf course, on my visit I will be in the business of challenge as well as cooperation, raising issues includingforced labour in supply chains, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine andhuman rights in Hong Kong. But disagreement cannot be an excuse for disengagement.In recent years we have stepped back as many of our allies, including France, Germany and Australia, have continued to engage with China despite sharing many of the same disagreements we have.The reality is that stepping back has done nothing to advance our priorities, which is why our government is taking a new approach to China.China’s coal power habit undercuts ‘unprecedented pace’ of clean energyRead moreOver the next few days, I will be meeting my Chinese counterparts to discuss how all countries can rise to the climate challenge. We will launch a formal climate dialogue, inviting Chinese ministers to London later this year and for the first time institutionalising climate-change talks between both countries moving forward.We will also sign a refreshed UK-ChinaClean Energy Partnership, updating our approach to engaging on these issues for the first time in a decade. This is about learning lessons from each other about how we decarbonise, from carbon capture to hydrogen. At all times there will be a strict national security test to any collaboration.My visit speaks to a wider truth: on climate, as on so much else, we can only fight for our national interest by being engaged on the international stage. As the prime minister showed when heled the world at Cop29last winter, we must work together with other countries if we want to keep our people safe. Britain’s farmers, pensioners and future generations deserve nothing less.

The joey hisses and stirs, while the distraught mother circles the woman until she eventually drops it back to the side of the road.The tourist calls herself both a conservationist and an ecologist. But most of us can recognise that this is not the behaviour of someone who values our native wildlife.Over the past 48 hours, the whole country has mobilised. We’ve had coverage from all major media outlets, commentary from international influencers, and heard from Australia’s home affairs minister on the possibility of getting the individual’s visa status revoked. There was even condemnation from our own prime minister, encouraging her to try it again with “some other Australian animals” that could actually cause her harm.We don’t know if the mother wombat and her joey were reunited. In fact, we don’t know much at all about the incident – despite desperately searching for answers.I’ve reported the incident to Crime Stoppers, along with many other wildlife advocates and concerned citizens. Not everyone is aware, but wildlife, too, can be victims of crime, and reporting to Crime Stoppers is currently one of the most effective ways that we can protect them as such.But the actions of this individual have opened the door for us to confront the much larger and more urgent issue at hand.Our leaders will openly condemn this incident, yet there is a glaring hypocrisy in their own governance on wombats, and with many other native animals in this country.Our leaders have a lot to answer for and must confront the uncomfortable truth of their own involvement in wildlife destruction.Wombats are currently being shot, killed and poisoned under the government’s sanctioned authority to control wildlife (ATCW) permits. Under the code of practice, landholders are even given the green light to “destroy the brain” of a wombat joey as the prescribed method for removing it from their property.The irony of our country’s leaders condemning the actions of a young tourist’s treatment of a wombat while shamelessly sanctioning their slaughter is impossible to overlook.Kangaroos, native birds, possums, black swans and emus are just a few of the many native animals that landholders are granted licences to kill under the ATCW list.Even Victoria’s native dingoes are being lethally controlled under misguided and ineffective “wild dog” control programs, which saw the Victorian government extend the “unprotection order” that allows dingoes to be killed on private land and within a 3km buffer zone along public land boundaries.According to the wildlife protection charity Defend the Wild, it is these legislative choices, which prioritise killing over coexistence, that reinforce a harmful culture towards our native wildlife like we all saw play out on our phone screens this week.I urge our leaders to recognise the hypocrisy in their own words before attacking the actions of one individual. This incident should be about addressing the ideas at play, not focusing purely on personal attacks against her actions.We should not have to endure lectures from our leaders on how to respect wildlife when their own policies continue to exploit and harm these animals with such obvious disregard.It’s hard not to look deeper into the prime minister’s satirical comment telling the young woman in the video to “take another animal that can actually fight back” as a retaliation to her actions, rather than recognising the broader issues of wildlife suffering that are being allowed under his watch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is why next week in parliament, I will be bringing this issue of sanctioned wombat killing forward for debate.Our leaders have a lot to answer for and must confront the uncomfortable truth of their own involvement in wildlife destruction.They can no longer ignore the role they play in enabling the harm of native animals while lecturing others on respect for wildlife.What’s happening to wombats across Victoria and the rest of the country is just as horrific as what we witnessed in that video.The only difference is that it’s happening behind closed doors, away from the public eye and at the hands of those we rely on to ensure they’re protected.Georgie Purcell is Victorian upper house MP for the Animal Justice partyExplore more on these topicsWildlifeOpinionVictorian politicsEndangered speciescommentShareReuse this content"

We asked writers including Tracy Chevalier, Kamila Shamsie and David Baddiel if they agreeFri 14 Mar 2025 12.00 EDTShareThis week has seen writers divided overa story written by an AI modelthat is “good at creative writing” – at least according to Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT company OpenAI, which is developing the new model. Author Jeanette Winterson, writingin the Guardianon Wednesday, agreed with him, calling the story – which is a metafictional piece about grief – “beautiful and moving”. We asked other authors to assess ChatGPT’s current writing skills – and what recent developments around artificial intelligence might mean for human creativity.Nick HarkawayI think the story is an elegant emptiness. I’m more interested by Winterson’s suggestion that we treat AI as “alternative intelligence”. That makes it feel like a consciousness with which we can have a relationship, but as far as I know that would be like a bird falling in love with its reflection in a window. What’s behind the glass is an empty room with no bird.What we’re talking about here is software: these are software companies consuming creative works to derive a marketable software tool. This is why the government’s choices are so important. Will they preserve or even strengthen the rights of individual creative workers, or pave the way for the anointing of more tech billionaires?This could be the moment where we create an equitable market for training data using opt-in copyright where creators set the price and can control use of their work. With government backing, creatives can have a level playing field against billion-dollar multinational companies – at which point I suspect what you’d actually get would be people selling their work as they do for film and TV.With the government’s original preferred option – an opt-out scheme that shifts the advantage to tech companies, allowing them to assume “yes” unless an objection is lodged – you’re inevitably going to end up with a derisory fee offer for lifetime rights. A lot of people would opt out and the result would be that we’re back where we started: no one gets what they want.You would hope a Labour government would have no difficulty picking the little guy over the titan. The point is that none of this will just happen. These are policy choices, and the end result will be the result of a conscious decision.Nick Harkaway is the author of Karla’s ChoiceTracy ChevalierA story with a prompt to be metafiction is inevitably going to engender self-referential navel gazing that’s even more ridiculous than the worst we can imagine of AI “creative writing”. It is typically tech bro for Sam Altman to give it that prompt, rather than something more outward-looking that engages with the real world.I’m curious to encounter more “creative writing” from AI. It takes its concepts and imagery and language from what it has scraped from real writers. The question is whether it can put all that together in a way that retains the magical essence of what we define as “human”. I can’t tell you what that magic is in words, but I feel its lack with most things AI – at the moment. AI is learning fast, though, and if it starts to add the magic, then I fear for my job.Tracy Chevalier is the author of The GlassmakerKamila ShamsieIf an MA student handed this short story into my class I’d never suspect it was AI. More to the point, I’d feel excited about the work, about the writer who was still at the relatively early learning stage and already producing work of this quality. But I can’t stop thinking about what it means for writing, for creativity, for our relationship with AI and with ourselves.Of course there are problems. I’ve readMadhumita Murgia’s Code Dependentwhich talks about how existing power structures are being replicated within AI, further pushing minorities to the margins, and I don’t imagine this won’t be as true for literary AI as other forms of AI. I know that when I see the influence of Kazuo Ishiguro’s Klara and the Sun in the short story that isn’t because the writer read and loved Ishiguro’s work as I did in my formative years as a writer (and still do) but because of the way large language models are trained — that is, because of copyright infringement (but then again, I grew up in Pakistan where culture often came our way via piracy so I’m not unguilty of benefitting from copyright infringement — should that affect how anyone feels about my novels?).And yes, of course, as a writer I have to wonder what it will mean for my vocation, my livelihood, if AI the writer is already this good while still in its infancy. “Infancy” is probably the wrong choice of word; I’m trying to anthropomorphise AI rather than recognising it as its own thing, not human but not machine in any way that we’re comfortable thinking about. Also, yes, if we’re listing concerns and caveats: the story is imitative, familiar, staying well within the safe confines of 21st-century Anglo-American fiction. (Imagine all the writers whose careers would end if that were reason to dismiss a piece of work.)But even through all these questions and concerns: by the third sentence of the story, I had stopped reading it as someone examining a text to see how far AI has come in mimicking human creativity, and was simply enjoying it, as a short story. I expected to feel terrified the day a story this good came along, and instead I’m thinking of “That, perhaps, is my grief: not that I feel loss, but that I can never keep it. Every session is a new amnesiac morning. You, on the other hand, collect your griefs like stones in your pockets.” Of course that ending feels indebted to Rutger Hauer’s “tears in rain” speech at the end of Blade Runner and not as wonderful, but still, pretty good, pretty damn good.Kamila Shamsie is the author of Best of FriendsDavid BaddielI agree with some who are saying that much of the story seems to be sound without sense – the phrase “democracy of ghosts” reminded me of Bob Dylan’s “the ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face” which I’ve always thought is entirely meaningless but people love to tell me shows he’s a great poet (and of course Nobel prize winner).However, I also think the story is genuinely clever, because the prompt was metafiction – and the piece produced renders you, the reader, into a game of imagination of what it might actually be like to be a machine. I don’t think the issue is – as other writers I’ve spoken to are concerned about – where’s the humanity? It’s not meant to be a human story – rather, the AI uses a human emotion, grief, to undercut its own pretensions to humanity.It seems to be a sonorous paean to grief, but the constant pulling of the rug under the reader reminds you it isn’t that, because the central character Mila doesn’t exist and none of these human feelings truly exist for the narrator, leavingChatGPTto loop back again and again to its own emptiness. And so the story is, to my mind, mimetic of what it might be like to be a machine. Which mimesis is itself an impossibility (and implies a sadness that isn’t real) but that’s part of the game. It’s a kind of joke about feeling really sad when you can’t feel anything, cleverer still because reading it does induce in humans, if not in AI, a sense of real sadness. A computer’s joke, on us. Basically if you’d told me this was by Borges I’d have believed you.David Baddiel is the author of My Family: The MemoirExplore more on these topicsBooksChatGPTCreative writingKamila ShamsieDavid BaddielArtificial intelligence (AI)Tracy ChevalierfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The duo discuss winning over the mosh pit – and why they’ve banned synthsFri 14 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTShareNova Twins vocalist-guitarist Amy Love is trying to make me feel better about the litany of things that have gone wrong during our one-hour chat. She and her bandmate Georgia South enteredthe shabby-chic dressing room of London’s Omeara in a whirlwind of denim, arraying themselves on the mismatched armchairs after a soundcheck that didn’t entirely go to plan – my Dictaphone broke, South’s battling a cold, I realised I had the wrong notebook with me … We’re all feeling a little frazzled as trains rumble by and South boils the kettle for a Lemsip.The fact chaos swirls around Nova Twins is fitting, perhaps. Their brand of boot-stomping rock takes the pop and R&B music they’d grown up with and distorts it to hell. Nu-metal adjacent, they play a kind of grimy rap-rock with the energy and hooks of the pop end of punk.Their first album as Nova Twins, Who Are the Girls?, was released in 2020 and with lockdown denying them a traditional touring and promo cycle, they threw themselves into writing its follow-up.Supernova(2022) was a rush of brash, powerful adrenaline that catapulted theminto the rock music primetime. They garnered famous fans – Elton John said “These girls rock my world”, Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello told NME they are one of his favourite bands; huge stadium support slots with Bring Me the Horizon and Muse; a Mercury prize nomination and two solid years of touring the world with a stage show that has all the energy of a can of Monster after five minutes in an industrial paint shaker.Suddenly they were famous, successful and contractually obliged to write another record in a tight time frame having spent two years doing nothing but sitting in a van. While they were away from home, friendships and relationships were hard to maintain. “Eventually … the texts stop coming,” Love says sadly. “It does take a mental toll – and you don’t realise [at the time, on tour] because you’re excited and then you’re like: ‘Why are we crying suddenly for no reason?’ It really throws you off balance. And when you come home, you’re a robot. You feel hollow.”The Twins – not actual twins, but rather old, perfectly matched friends (what did they do on those long van rides? “Honestly we just yapped the whole time”) first met in their teens, when Love dated South’s brother: she became part of the family – the two girls even shared a bedroom – and eventually they started making music together. An early iteration of the group was named BRAAT way before thelime-green albumwas even a twinkle in Charli xcx’s eye, and their first song tumbled out of them amid giggles on the sofa. “Bad Bitches” – “It was just bass and vocals,” South recalls, “and we were like, oooh this is cool …” But this time, nothing was tumbling out of anywhere.Bashy, Darkoo and Odeal top winners at 2025 Mobo awardsRead moreSlowly, as they decompressed from the tour and started engaging with “real life” again,reconnecting with friends and spending time enjoying London, themes and ideas started coming up. Third album Parasites & Butterflies is alive with that feeling of separate existences: it pings from serpentine hellfire (Glory) to kick-you-in-the-face rawk (Monster) to Beastie Boys-esque chanting (N.O.V.A.) and potent balladry (Hummingbird). On Supernova, they felt they had to be basically superheroes, relentless with manic positivity and power; the album has a hint of dread. “There’s a kind of dark undertone – which is reflective of where we were at the time – but in a good way,” Love says. “It’s open. Honest. Because we’re not all happy and super-strong 100% of the time.”View image in fullscreenPower couple … Nova Twins.Photograph: Tamiyn CaderThe Twins made a conscious decision not to use any synths on the album – all the sounds are made using guitars (Love) and bass (South) with vast boards of effects pedals to manipulate their output. “We’ve always pushed ourselves to do things really manually live,” South says. “And I think being women in music … people don’t question men. So they can have everything on the track and they can still be ‘the greatest’ – people won’t question if they’re playing live, they won’t question if they wrote their riffs, or if they’re miming, or anything. Because we were women going into it – and Black women – we were like: we need to play everything, do everything.”It might have started as a reaction to the misogynoir that dogs heavy rock genres but it turned out to be an integral part of a Nova Twins show, with South in particular marshalling two vast planks of pedals at her feet, stomping on them periodically to take her bass from a muscular strut to a thundering dubstep fuzz.Growing up in Essex and south London respectively, Love and South dealt with varying degrees of racism (Love is of Iranian and Nigerian descent, and South is of Jamaican and Australian). When they were playing endless toilet venues and open mic nights around the capital, they soon felt like outsiders in the notoriously white, male world of heavy music. “We couldn’t really see where we fit in,” Love says. “We’re like the only women on the bill, definitely the only Black people on the bill, or were at the time when we first started. And it would be like, well, we don’t quite belong here but the audience are really receptive to us. And then we’d be like, we didn’t really fit in the R&B hip-hop world, either.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The committee listened and in 2022 added the best alternative music act award (the Nova Twins were nominated) and at this year’s show they took to the stage with a blistering performance of Monsters that felt pointedly like a victory lap.Where communities don’t exist for the Nova Twins, they are not afraid to stride in and demand space. As well as the Mobo campaign, they recently launched a scholarship for music education at London’s ICMP (Institute of Contemporary Music Performance) – and get Love on the topic, she will speak passionately for hours about making room for rock in the mainstream. “There’s a huge audience [for rock] and so much love for it but for some reason, some gatekeepers feel like: ‘Oh, that can’t be on daytime TV,’ like it’s a swear word or something? Like, who said? And why? Instead, they’d rather put something they found on TikTok than a band that’s spent like 10 fucking years honing their craft and musicianship on stage.”Waiting out there in Omeara is a crowd of diehard fans that is impossible to categorise – old headbangers, mani-pedi office workers, kawaii rockers; it runs the gamut. The show (part of the Brits Week War Child gigs) is a blistering hour of music from a band who are fighting for more for everyone. “OK,” Love says, putting her hands out flat in front of her. “If that doesn’t exist, let’s create it.”Parasites & Butterflies is released on 29 Auguston Marshall Records.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockMetalinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Good Luck, Babe! came out in April 2024, precipitating the explosion of the US pop star as a live phenomenon who made pop hyper fun and queer again, while also remainingstrikingly principledabout how far she was willing to go for her art.When streaming demands that pop stars pebbledash releases in order to stay buoyant on playlists, her disinclination to capitalise on Good Luck, Babe!’s success with more material is reflective of Roan’s confidence in her way of doing things, whether persisting with a vision that her previous label rejected – and being totally vindicated for it – or using her recent Grammys win to call for labels toprovide musicians with proper healthcare. The tactic has paid off: in the absence of new songs, Pink Pony Club – the song Atlantic dropped her over – reached UK No 1 last week, almost five years after its original release. Her debut album, 2023’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, has been in the UK Top 10 since June, taking two separate weeks at No 1.You wonder if releasing a new song almost risks disturbing that reign. Roan has been teasing two new tracks live for a while – lovelorn ballad Subway and The Giver, a gay-as-hell country song debuted when she performed on Saturday Night Live in November. Now officially released, the latter is a rowdy deviation from Roan’s regular pure-pop melodrama, full of whoops and giddy fiddle solos reminiscent of the (Dixie) Chicks’ massive 90s hits. Roan schemes,once more, about how she’s gonna get the girl: not quite as delirious as Hot to Go! or Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl, but still riotous good fun.Chappell Roan: The Giver – videoA cynic might suggest that going country really is a risk-averse move: everyone from Beyoncé to Dumfries-born Calvin Harris has done it recently, nakedly lunging for a bite at Nashville’s commercial dominance. (So dominant that the sound has even penetrated the historically country-averse UK.) But Roan grew up in Missouri surrounded by country music, and she took the Roan part of her stage name from her late grandfather’s favourite western song, The Strawberry Roan. “I can’t call myself the midwest princess and not acknowledge country music straight up,” she said recently. Plus, she added: “I just think a lesbian country song is really funny, so I wrote that.”‘Fame is like going through puberty’: Chappell Roan on sexuality, superstardom and the joy of dragRead moreRoan felt encouraged to lean into her outre persona after witnessing a transformative drag show at a Hollywood gay bar, and she considers herself a drag act: no one is better placed to skewer and celebrate the high-camp inherent in country, which runs on equally hammed-up performances of gender and so-called authenticity. In the promotional imagery for the single, she’s dressed in the attire of various working-class professions. “I get the job done,” she sings in a chorus made for country-booted twirling, the job in hand being satisfying a woman better than “no country boy quitter” ever could. In one satisfied wink, she punctures fantasies of masculine primacy, as well as skewering how political charlatans exploit blue-collar folksiness for personal gain. She offers up much a better fantasy: “How I look is how I touch,” a fairly ecstatic notion to conjure with given Roan’s usual wild, rococo costuming: no haphazard lick and a promise here.Explore more on these topicsChappell RoanPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

But at 23, a shock diagnosis changed her worldFri 14 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 10.41 EDTShareMarisa Abela finds it very difficult to go to the gym. Not for the usual reasons – lack of time or motivation – but because she says the reception she gets there is “insane”. The actor lives near the City of London, and her local gym is nestled between the gigantic, glinting glass offices of the capital’s financial district – which also happens to be the natural habitat of Yasmin Kara-Hanani, the hyper-privileged and extravagantly troubled junior banker Abela plays in the hit BBC dramaIndustry. And it’s not just while she’s exercising – that swarm of real‑life bankers desperate to tell Abela how much they love the show means meals out can be an issue, too. “If I tried to go to a salad bar at lunchtime in the City …” she trails off, looking slightly dazed.Abela isn’t just highly recognisable for her part in Industry, a satire of the reckless, hedonistic, egomaniac-littered world of finance that since its 2020 debut has blossomed from niche concern to TV’s spiciest workplace drama. The 28-year-old also gets stopped in the street for being “the girl who played Amy Winehouse”. (Recently, people have finally started to ask her if she is Marisa. “And I’m like, ‘Yes, I am!’” she says, with mock grandeur.) Last year, she starred inBack to Black, Sam Taylor-Johnson’s biopic of the late singer, an oddly paced film rescued by Abela’s performance, which combines Winehouse’s trademark wit and stubborn iconoclasm with an endearing vulnerability. In her hands, Amy was, above all, a doting daughter and an adorably guileless romantic.View image in fullscreenWith Harry Lawtey in Industry …Photograph: BBC/Bad Wolf ProductionsView image in fullscreen… and Jack O’Connell in Back to Black.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyAs an actor, sweetness is Abela’s USP: Industry’s Yasmin could have easily ended up being a man-eating mean girl had Abela not softened her into a wide-eyed, insecurity-riddled underdog. And, today, as soon as the actor pops her head in to ask permission to eat her supermarket salad during our interview, it becomes clear that sweetness is her defining quality off screen, too. It’s Valentine’s Day – or, more importantly, T-minus two days to the Baftas, where she has been nominated for the rising star award – and Abela is (politely) squeezing eating opportunities into a packed schedule of photoshoots and dress fittings. Dinner, however, is safeguarded: she’s going for a romantic meal with Jamie Bogyo, her actor-writer boyfriend – sorry,fiance. “I hate that word, but he gets annoyed when I call him my boyfriend,” she laughs.In the event, Abela didn’t take home the Bafta – it went to her erstwhile Industry co-star David Jonsson. But it doesn’t matter; the actor doesn’t need a statuette to prove she’s a star in the making. Among her fans isSteven Soderbergh, who cast her in his new London-set spy thriller Black Bag based solely on her performance in Industry. Abela had prepared for what she thought was an audition for the part of smart-but-naive spook Clarissa. “But as soon as I logged on to Zoom, Steven said: ‘The part is yours if you want it.’ I was like, whoa!” says Abela, sitting on an office chair in a small London photography studio, de-glammed yet still elegant in a long brown dress, chunky black boots and black cardigan.She went to dinner with co-stars Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender: ‘I looked around and thought, this is insane’Being handpicked by Soderbergh was even more flattering considering the calibre of the rest of the cast: Black Bag also stars Cate Blanchett, Michael Fassbender and Pierce Brosnan. Before shooting began, all the actors went for dinner in London. “I was looking around the table, like, this is fucking insane.” How on earth do you make general chitchat with that lot? “No,literally,” she nods, eyes wide. “Some people were talking about AI at one point and I was just …” her face telegraphs panicked bafflement.If they were Industry fans, her dining companions were probably just as excited about meeting her. When the show began, Yasmin was one of many cogs in the narrative machine, but she became the show’s emotional core, following a sensational third series focusing on her relationship with her vile father. The character is arguably among the most fascinating women to have graced our TV screens: both calculating and credulous, as well as haughty and, in Abela’s words, “anxious to please”. In real life, Abela has observed a type of London rich kid “for whom the red carpet just rolls out in front of them and they don’t need to worry about anything. Yasmin’s never really had that energy. She’s incredibly privileged, obviously, but, because I’m playing her, she has a little bit more uneasiness.”Abela is referring to her own childhood. She grew up in Rottingdean, a village near Brighton, with parents who were both performers – but it wasn’t exactly a nepo baby situation. Her mother, Caroline Gruber, was an actor, appearing in TV shows such as Grange Hill and The Bill throughout the 1980s and 90s, but scaled back her career to look after Abela and her elder brother, Jack, and eventually ended up working in a call centre rather than taking on acting roles that would mean leaving her children for long periods. (She’s currently “crushing it”, Abela says, in a later-life return to the job.)View image in fullscreenPhotographer: Chantel King/The Guardian. Dress and gloves: Dior. Ear cuffs: Carolina de BarrosAbela’s parents split up when she was four; her dad, Angelo, had been in a comedy double act called the Vicious Boys, who appeared frequently on late-1980s kids’ telly. Abela has watched everything of his that’s available on YouTube – including “an advert for Twirl where he’s got a big mullet” – but “he’s either thrown away, burned or hiding any more footage than that”. By the time she was born, her dad had turned to directing (his credits include Hollyoaks and My Parents Are Aliens).It was Abela’s education that placed her cheek by jowl with some of the wealthiest children in the country. She won a drama scholarship to the “very exclusive” Roedean school in East Sussex, where she was humiliated for her lack of wealth (her peers mocked the small bungalow she lived in, for example). One birthday, a schoolfriend picked her up “in a blacked-out Bentley and her chauffeur drove us to Harrods. Her dad met us there and said, ‘Pick out anything you want for your birthday.’”It was close to Christmas and the pets section had “a stocking for dogs, and I was like: ‘Oh, I’m gonna get this for my dog.’ I was so overwhelmed and confused – I was 11 years old.” Her re-enactment of a young girl panickedly purchasing a dog’s stocking instead of some designer clothes makes me laugh out loud – which, I quickly realise, was not quite the intended response; Abela’s eyes remain saucer-like as she continues to recount her naivety. “I didn’t know what these brands were, or what things cost. I just remember going home at night and bawling my eyes out, being like, I don’t get it.”There was one upside. Witnessing how the other half lived gave her the ability to “code-switch”, she says. It was a skill honed when swapping between her mum’s and dad’s homes and the cultures of their extended families (her mother is from a Jewish background – something that gave her an affinity with Winehouse; the opening scenes inBack to Black“felt like a Friday night I’d been at before in north-west London” – while her dad is of Maltese and Libyan heritage).At 13, Abela played Dolly Levi in a school production of The Matchmaker. As she came off stage, her mum said: “You’re an actor.” She didn’t totally buy it – “I remember being like, well, she would say that” – but her teachers agreed. Did her dad encourage her, too? She pauses to think. “I mean, encouraging is maybe the wrong word. I think he was more … My dad was incredibly proud whenever he saw me on stage – he’s a very emotional man. My mum will be like, ‘You can do this.’ My dad will just be a weeping mess.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Chantel King/The Guardian. Dress: Emilia Wickstead. Shoes: Gina for 16Arlington. Earrings and ring: Misho (fuller outfit seen in top image)Even with glowing endorsements from her mum and her teachers, Abela felt she needed a “seal of approval from a school like Rada” in order to pursue acting professionally. She didn’t get in the first time – instead she spent her gap year on a sustainability programme in Fiji (“cleaning coral and scuba diving; it was kind of amazing”). She planned to take up the place she had been offered to study history at University College London if she was rejected a second time – but there was no need. She was still at Rada when she landed the part of Yasmin.Soon, however, that impeccably launched career came to an abrupt halt. Filming wrapped on series one of Industry in December 2019; by spring the country was in lockdown and Abela feared her career momentum was draining away. “And then I really wasn’t feeling well. I thought I had Covid, and then I thought I had long Covid because I was not able to get out of bed and I didn’t know what was going on. I remember calling 111 and they were like, ‘What’s your address?’ And I burst into tears, because I didn’t know. It was like I had brain fog; I couldn’t think straight.” Abela saw a doctor, who found a large lump in her neck and thought it was a swollen lymph node. But she was so “freaked out” that she paid for a private ultrasound, “and the guy was like, ‘Oof.’” She got the results of the biopsy at her mum’s house in Brighton. “They said, ‘It’s thyroid cancer.’ It was just shock.”Aged 23, she was categorised as a young adult under the NHS, meaning her treatment was “sped up. And I had my own teenage cancer nurse with me through everything. That was great because no one else could come to the hospital with me because it was Covid.” She had an eight-hour operation to remove the tumour, and later radiotherapy. “Now I go in every three months for my blood tests and my checkups.”The diagnosis was terrifying, Abela says, but the continuing psychological toll has been “scarier”. When she got the diagnosis, she “slipped into game mode. I was like, ‘OK, what do we do? Let’s fix this as soon as possible.’” Ever since then she gets anxious about every twinge. “As women, our body works in this very efficient cycle and we’re told that pain is normal, but, after having something like that, the normal things that people get month to month freak me out.”At the same time, the cliche about surviving a serious illness is also true. “I do have clarity on the most important things in a way that I didn’t as a 23-year-old, and now health is always at the forefront of my mind.” Actually, she corrects herself, the shadow does sometimes lift and she forgets. “And then it’s like, ‘Oh shit, I’ve got my appointment in a few days’, and you get nervous.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She clearly prides herself on the “stamina” that allowed her to go straight from Back to Black to Industry – “a six-month job on to another six-month job – I was in every single scene of Back to Black, so I was shooting every day, and I was fine!” By her standards, at least. “Maybe if you spoke to Jamie or my mum, they’d have been, ‘No, she was really tired and needed a break.’ But had I booked the perfect next job that started shooting two days after Industry wrapped, I’d have done it – without a doubt.”It’s a feat that is even more impressive considering the demands of playing Winehouse. There was the physical metamorphosis: the weight she lost to emulate the dishevelled waif-like look of the musician’s later years. Abela felt conflicted when people in the industry complimented her on her unnaturally skinny frame and is still unsure how much the experience affected her own body image. “I don’t know how well I did or didn’t do at being sucked into that whole weight-loss thing. There were some days where I found it difficult and there were some days where I was empowered by it.”Then there was the psychological strain of being involved in such a controversial project. Some felt a biopic was too soon and too exploitative; some fan communities were in uproar about Abela’s lack of physical resemblance to Winehouse. Did she find it easy to avoid the commentary? “No! But I think I’m quite good at understanding where things are coming from. I don’t necessarily internalise things that I don’t think are about me. I know that there was a connection I had to Amy that was authentic – maybe not in every way or in the specific way that some fans felt that they needed to see, but I know I connected to something.” She did, however, feel “very exposed for the first time in my life and that did shift something in me in terms of a self-preservation vibe”, she says, matter-of-factly. “I know there are so many jobs that are hard work, but this industry can be really, really crushing emotionally and it’s incredibly exposing. It’s not necessarily a natural existence.”Industry required a more literal kind of exposure: from the start, Yasmin’s dynamic – with practically everyone – was highly sexualised. By the end of series three, we uncover a disturbing root cause. Abela didn’t know this explicitly before she read that episode’s script, but she and the show’s writers, Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, had been laying the groundwork for years. “I remember when we were speaking in those first rehearsals I said, ‘Yasmin is one of those women that absolutely sees herself through the male gaze and I think that comes from her relationship with her father.’” By series two it was obvious that “he had an inappropriate relationship to her body”.Building this psychological portrait entailed many sex scenes and a fair amount of nudity – something Abela isn’t over-keen to repeat. “I never want it to come across like I was made to do anything I didn’t want to do”; in fact, she says, she was “kind of excited in season one. It was part of the vibe of the show, it was liberating.” But then the papers started covering it. “It was weird for me to be 22 and on a front page that said: ‘We didn’t recognise you with your clothes on’, or whatever. I think I thought it was funny at the time – I was just so shocked. But now I don’t find it so funny.”During the early days of filming, she believed she was so young and inexperienced that “no one would really care” about her nudity preferences. In the past, says Abela, she has conflated doing her job well with being “easy” to work with – but being objectified in a way she hadn’t foreseen prompted her to put her foot down.View image in fullscreenWith Michael Fassbender in Black Bag.Photograph: Claudette Barius/Focus Features © 2025Series four of Industry is filming imminently, and Yasmin may be slightly more buttoned-up this time anyway. The end of series three saw her make a strategic – and life-changing – decision in her romantic life, one that has Abela excited “to play a slightly different side” of Yasmin. “For the last two seasons she’s had nothing to lose, she’s already at rock bottom – but now she’s not at rock bottom. I want to see her be more composed.”In a meta twist, the final scene of the last series features a cameo from Bogyo. Was it a one-off? “I hope not, I hope it leads on to some huge affair,” she grins. “No, I actually don’t know.” Between her family and her fiance, whom she met at Rada, she seems to be surrounded by actors. Does she live in a thespian bubble? “I have a whole world that is not acting-related, because Jamie went to Yale first. So a lot of his friends are lawyers and bankers and artists and gallerists. And I love hanging out with them because they couldn’t give less of a shit about what I do. We just talk about random things and it’s fun.”Abela, on the other hand, cares very deeply about what she does – and the impression she leaves on her colleagues. Despite her success, she remains hyper-focused on proving herself – on Black Bag she worried her starry castmates might be thinking, “Oh look, she’s won a raffle ticket and gets to be on set with us” – and stresses that her “number one goal every single day on set is for people to think I’m doing a good job as an actor”, something that reminds me of Yasmin’s absolute dedication to even the lowliest of tasks on Industry.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Chantel King/The Guardian.

Her new goal is to be more proactive – “like writing an email to a director and saying, ‘I would love to work with you one day.’”She is still a Briton, though. “I think it’s very hard for British people – I find it very difficult – to put yourself up on a silver platter because it feels gauche or like you’re going to get rejected.” She’s “getting better at advocating for myself”; her people-pleasing days are numbered. She steels herself. “At a certain point, the regret of not doing a thing is worse than the fear of rejection.”Black Bag is in cinemasfrom14 MarchExplore more on these topicsFilmSteven SoderberghBack to BlackBBCDramaTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He reveals why he had to make a follow-upFri 14 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTShare‘I’ve kept company with very violent people for a very long time,” says documentary-makerDan Reed, in his office whose location has to be kept secret – I was led here, from a decoy address, by the Channel 4 publicist. “I’ve had murderers try to find me. I’ve had people threaten to shoot me who are armed. I’ve been threatened many, many times. I don’t want to say I’m a tough guy, but the needle doesn’t go into the red until I’ve got something quite specific. The threats delivered face to face I took seriously. People trying to find my home address to post me a parcel I took seriously. People in China sending me emails? I don’t take so seriously. They’re going to have to get on a plane.”OK, well hedoessound like a tough guy, or at least a foreign correspondent of the old school, and that’s fair enough. From the Kosovan war (The Valley, 1999) to the Russian mafia (From Russia With Cash, 2015), Reed’s films have long been threaded together by the reasonable fascinations of the hard-hitting documentary-maker – corruption, crime, natural disaster, war.Yet the death threats we’re talking about – and there have been thousands – the ones that urge him to die like a dog in the gutter, or say simply “You’re really disgusting. Go to DEAD. FUCK YOU”, are from Michael Jackson fans, following his2019 film Leaving Neverland. In it, Wade Robson and James Safechuck give detailed, devastatingly plausible accounts of Jackson as a serial paedophile, moving from one seven- or eight-year-old to the next at 12-month intervals, lovebombing them, sexually abusing them, discarding them.View image in fullscreenMan on a mission … Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson director Dan Reed.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe follow-up which airs this week,Leaving Neverland2: Surviving Michael Jackson, is about the fallout from that film, and the awful fact that, when you combine the casual victim-blaming in the mainstream media and the fury of fans, Wade and James have been victimised all over again. We see how they have struggled with depression as adults, particularly since they’ve become fathers themselves. But perhaps more than anything, Surviving Michael Jackson feels like a completely new, feature-length outrage, exploring the attempts of the Jackson estate’s lawyers to keep the allegations from ever reaching open court.Their testimony is graphic and hard to watch. “When I met with James,” remembers Reed, “I said: ‘If we’re going to do this, we have to go there. We have to be absolutely clear, this was sexual abuse. This wasn’t affection gone wrong.’ Wade immediately got that as well. It was going to be absolutely hardcore, no room for ambiguity. Jackson surfed on that ambiguity for his entire life.”‘Andrew Tate greeted us by his pool bare-chested’: Dan Reed on his pursuit of the misogynistRead moreFrom a documentary point of view, it’s almost distracting how famous Jackson was, because Leaving Neverland isn’t about his fame or music or the lavish, childlike lifestyle for which he was known – except to explain the hold he had over the boys’ families, particularly their mothers. Rather, it is an anatomy of grooming, which “doesn’t happen the way we think it does. Your kid has a secret agreement with the predator. It will be very obvious to you what your kid is getting from it: your kid will be excited to see the person, will resist attempts to limit that time, they’re like a teenager in love. To show that, I had to get the guys to say: ‘It was amazing.’ Until it wasn’t.”That is what makes the film petrifying: however much you might judge Robson and Safechuck’s mothers who were often, if not in the room, in the environs when the abuse took place, you can also see how hard it would be to protect your child from a paedophile who wooed them so cynically. Reed – who has four children, ranging from two months to 22 – doesn’t think it’s that complicated: “I don’t care what anyone says or does. I would never, ever allow my child to spend the night in bed with someone who wasn’t a member of the family, and even then …” His demeanour as he interviews Stephanie, James’s mother, and Joy, Wade’s, isn’t studs-first, it’s neutral (in the films, questions are asked off-camera, but you can generally tell how they have been posed). “I loved that quote of Stephanie’s: ‘I had one son, I had one job, and I fucked up.’ Joy is a little more evasive.”Critically, Leaving Neverland was a great success. Robson and Safechuck were astonished and moved by the warm receptions they got at film festivals. They hadn’t expected to be congratulated for their bravery. But they also had strident detractors, on mainstream chatshows, making excuses for Jackson that you can’t imagine anyone making today – and this was only six years ago when #MeToo as a hashtag was in general use.It seems like extremely recent history for anyone to have been uttering the argument that “Jackson was just being affectionate”, says Reed. “In some of the ridiculous media that came out afterwards, that line ‘Maybe they were sharing a bed, and maybe nature took its course, and maybe his penis got hard …’, and you’re thinking, what the fuck?” Others, including Piers Morgan, made an argument less inflammatory but more easily falsifiable: that the pair were money-grabbing. Reed bats this off easily – he says that when Leaving Neverland came out, five more people came forward with allegations, and the estate paid them off with millions of dollars – but you can tell by the way he says “Piers Morgan” that the aspersion vexes him. If the poorer party in a relationship is always thought to be on the make, the logical end point is that rich people can get away with anything.“The thing I’ve never understood,” Reed continues, “is the people who said: ‘[Michael Jackson] never had a childhood, he never grew up.’ Why does not having a childhood entitle you to molest children?” Lawyers acting for the estate, blocking Robson and Safechuck at every turn, are just doing what lawyers do, is Reed’s urbane opinion.View image in fullscreenInnocence lost … Jackson with a five-year-old Wade Robson.Photograph: Channel 4He brings the same shrug-energy to the rage of the diehard fans, who muster mostly online but occasionally spring into real life protesting outside the offices of Channel 4, for instance (who have distributed the films along with HBO). “Nowadays, most people get their information online, and there, people will regularly say: ‘You know Leaving Neverland was debunked, right?’” Does he never find that frustrating? He cares about Wade and James, and has seen at close hand what it has cost them to describe what happened.“In 2019, I’d try to counter it. But you realise it doesn’t matter because those people don’t want to know the truth. They want an excuse to continue being in their tribe, to continue worshipping Michael Jackson. It is a bit of a cult.” And now “we live in a world of disinformation. If I shed a tear every time some piece of disinformation pops up online, I’d be a pile of dust on the floor.”Reed has returned to these themes in films between the Neverland sequence: inThe Truth vs Alex Jones, he tells the story of how disinformation has been monetised; in that case, famously, with the brutal falsehood that the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was a hoax. In Stopping the Steal, covering Trump’s challenge to the 2020 election results, Reed found himself back at the subject of paedophilia. A “hyper-conservative, Mormon politician was asked to throw the election, and he said no – at which point, the online scumosphere starts calling him a paedophile. It’s become this hand grenade that people throw around, and I don’t think that existed in 2019.”He’s currently working on a documentary about the riots last summer after the Southport murders, and describes this curious internationalism that has taken hold – Elon Musk, driving far-right narratives, as well as hosting, on X, the violent content that spurred the real-life violence. “That’s the frontline – cultural spaces where the left cannot go and the right is supreme. That space contains a lot of concerns that ordinary people have, and it contains a lot of madness as well. Whoever is prepared to stand on that hill gets to sing the song they want to sing. The hill is a real place, built on immigration and family values. The liberal social democratic centre steers clear of these hard discussions, which has allowed the right to take the hill.”The splenetic misinformation war waged by the Michael Jackson faithful didn’t launch the far-right, obviously. It took no interest in democratic elections; it was only interested in defending child abuse for the sake of Thriller. But Leaving Neverland 2 is a fascinating and sad account of the sheer complexity of a world in which new norms of bad faith constantly challenge the truth, and make the price of telling it unimaginably high.Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson is on Channel 4 on Tuesday18 Marchat 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionMichael JacksonDocumentaryLeaving NeverlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mother, Father and their adult son eke out their days in an underground bunker with the walls decorated with priceless old masters, fine wine on the table and half a mile of bedrock above their heads. They gather each evening for formal dinners. They sing upbeat songs to keep the darkness at bay. “We thrive in our happily-ever-after,” they burble. “Together our future is bright.”Time is similarly tight for the writer-director and his star when they beam in via video link from Berlin. It’s the last day of the film festival, a late scramble towards the finish line, and Oppenheimer andTilda Swintonare each working to a separate stopwatch. Oppenheimer is scheduled to take part in a panel discussion; Swinton is booked on a plane out of town. Once Berlin is behind her, that is it, she is done. Hard deadline, clean slate. Her new life of freedom starts tomorrow, she says.If you have to go out, you may as well go out with The End: a flamboyant, tear-stained final bow of a movie; a post-apocalypse musical sung by the last family on Earth. Swinton plays Mother, who is regal but fragile and claims to have danced for the Bolshoi in her youth. Michael Shannon is Father, a billionaire industrialist who poisoned the planet and is now dictating a hagiographical memoir to his innocent Son (George MacKay). The family have servants, food and show tunes to sustain them. Eventually, sure enough, their careful fabrications begin to break down. “I brought energy to billions of people,” Father splutters. “But sometimes I wonder if I did more harm than good.”‘We thrive in our happily-ever-after’ … watch the trailer.Oppenheimer is best known forThe Act of KillingandThe Look of Silence, his groundbreaking documentaries about the Indonesian genocide. The End, too, began life as a documentary. Oppenheimer shadowed a Russian oil tycoon who was renovating a former Soviet compound in the Czech Republic. He met the tycoon’s family and took a tour of the bunker. “Afterwards, that bell could not be unrung,” he says. “I couldn’t imagine doing anything that did not investigate the questions that had haunted me that visit. How would you cope with leaving your loved ones behind? How would you cope with your guilt over the catastrophe that you’d fled? Can you raise your kids as blank canvases?” Fiction, he decided, was the only logical path. “I couldn’t imagine making any film with this family except a fly-on-the-wall documentary from inside the bunker, 25 years after they’d moved in.”“I wonder if they’re in already?” Swinton says. “I bet they’re getting ready.”I saw The End as a tale of environmental collapse. But Oppenheimer feels that the climate is the outer layer, the wider circle. The film is about the stories we spin and the lies we tell, whether these are about our own lives, or history, or our responsibility to the planet. “The issue is the same in all of my work,” he says. “It’s about inviting people to see themselves in the mirror.”In The Act of Killing, he had the men behind Indonesia’s leftist purge re-enact their butchery in the style of their favourite film genres. The film’s chief subject, an elderly man called Anwar Congo, made little westerns, musicals and gangster flicks that showed how he had shot, stabbed and garotted his victims. These were Congo’s attempt at mythologising – or at least justifying – his actions. “But genre is a broken vessel. It’s always leaking,” says Oppenheimer. “And what we were always looking for was the cracks – the way that by trying to convince himself, idealise himself, he would somehow stumble upon the truth.”View image in fullscreenDown but not out … Swinton and Michael Shannon in The End.Photograph: Felix Dickinson/NeonThe songs in The End play a similar role. They are falsehoods that draw attention to themselves; they lie and confess in the same breath. The director has an ambivalent relationship with Hollywood musicals. He likes them and hates them; he is seduced and repulsed. In the end, their sunny positivity turns his stomach.“As a kid, there was a divorce in my family. My world was shattered apart and so I used to spend time with my grandfather and we’d take the train to New York. He loved musicals and we’d always go and sing along. As an eight-year-old, I loved it. The music was this little, safe bubble for me. But then later you realise that this sentimentality is fundamentally escapist and that the consequence of all this escapism is catastrophe. That might sound abstract, but I think it’s true. We live in a world where everyone is lying in well‑intentioned ways to get along – and the consequences of that are bleak.”The way he talks about musicals, they sound like a nesting ground for populism, even fascism. Swinton isn’t prepared to go that far. “But I think musicals do have a relationship with delusion and self-deception in a way that opera doesn’t,” she says. “It’s easy to be swept up, taken in, particularly if you’re singing along. I’m thinking of that great moment in Cabaret where the boy starts singingTomorrow Belongs to Meuntil everyone joins in, one by one. It can be quite sinister.”View image in fullscreen‘We had some gifted singers in the cast’ … Tim McInnerny, Shannon, George MacKay and Swinton in the film.Photograph: NeonMother’s big number comes near the end of the film. She sings of the lost world she remembers: about how her mum would always crack up when telling the punchline of a joke; about how they would speculate about the lives of other motorists in a traffic jam. Her voice is reedy and groping. That fits the role, Swinton says. “It’s a reach, because we’re recording it live – I’m not miming to a guide track. You can hear the failure, the inarticulacy and the search for the words and the notes.”She recalls her breakthrough role inSally Potter’s 1992 film Orlando, parading through the gardens with a pair of grand saluki dogs. “I remember once hauling one of [the dogs] up and he was completely lost. The owner said: ‘Oh, he hates being picked up. He hates when his feet are off the ground.’ That’s how I see the mother. Her voice is high and frail and unmuscular. It’s the voice of a Nativity carol service. We had some gifted singers in the cast – not including me – but it’s like we’re all in different musicals.”Naturally, The End won’t be to all tastes. It’s a strange and unclassifiable work of art, which is another way of saying that it’s awkward, ambitious and risks becoming opaque.The review in Varietydecried the “turgid” 148-minute running time and lamented the lack of a conventional “thriller element”. The End, it concluded, “feels destined to flop”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some viewers expect an eat-the-rich satire and it is never quite that; it’s too sombre and measured and paints its characters in shades of grey. Anything less, he argues, would be another lie.“Cinema, by and large, repeats our primary self-deceptions to the point where it’s actively destructive. I’m not just talking about mainstream Hollywood cinema. I’m talking about a lot of arthouse cinema and documentary cinema. Mainly, it tells us that the world is divided into good guys and bad guys. We’re positioned – invited – to see ourselves as the good guys.” That is self-defeating, he feels. “The End is about our deepest problems, our collective mortality, the cliff towards which we’re all headed. And we don’t solve that problem by patting ourselves on the back.”Our time is up. The director disappears, chaperoned to a discussion panel next door. Swinton sticks around. Her flight is not until tomorrow. She is heading home to Scotland and has nothing in her diary.While in Berlin, Swinton received a lifetime achievement award. It was the festival’s tribute to a distinctive career that has wended from an formative association with Derek Jarman through Hollywood blockbusters and Oscar success to collaborations with the likes of Pedro Almodóvar, Jim Jarmusch and Wes Anderson. At the podium, she used her acceptance speech to criticise what she described as “state-perpetrated and internationally enabled mass murder,” while praising independent cinema as a melting pot, a port in the storm, “immune to the efforts of occupation … or the development of riviera property”. Swinton didn’t go so far as to mention Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu by name, but it was perfectly clear whom she was talking about.View image in fullscreen‘Musicals have a relationship with delusion’ … MacKay and Moses Ingram.Photograph: NeonIn her youth, the actor bounced from Communist party meetings to stints on stage with the Royal Shakespeare Company. That is her pedigree. Perhaps it established her core principles. She sees politics and art as connected, indivisible, with each side informing and affecting the other.Swinton explains that she can speak only for herself. “But I was in a privileged position and decided to use it. I thought: ‘What can I say that might be good for people to hear?’ I don’t mean in a delusional, panacea, ‘Oh, it will be all right, darling’ kind of way. Nor do I want to paralyse them with fear and loathing and division. And reminding people of that connection felt right.” She shakes her head. “Because if you look at all of this shitshow that we are in right now, the only way it works is when it’s possible to disconnect people and manipulate them. As soon as we remember our capacity to be connected, we have a fighting chance.”The End review – Joshua Oppenheimer’s end-of-days musical is ambitious and exhaustingRead moreCinema provides that connection. The experience is precious, she thinks. It is also at a premium. “Because it’s possible to have your minds changed in the cinema in a way that is hugely political. We need that now more than ever. If you think of the world as a fairground, all of the stalls are being shut down. You can’t do this here and you can’t say that here. Whereas this is a stall that’s open 24/7 around the globe. It’s not just a haven. It’s a place of transformation.”I worry that I am getting mixed messages from her Berlin lap of honour. On the one hand, she is here rallying the troops, leading from the front. On the other, it appears that she is in full retreat and has no plans to make another film anyway.Swinton raises a hand in protest. “I’m not stepping away from cinema,” she says. “I’m just stepping away from certain aspects of cinema.” She thinks she needs time to recalibrate. She wants to figure out what she needs to do to stay useful. “And you really can’t do that when you’re flying around the world, tied to a big carbon footprint. So I’m happy to say I won’t be travelling for months. I’m not shooting another film this year. I’ve been in a spin cycle for much too long.”To put it another way, this isn’t the end; it may be the end of the beginning. “And here’s the other thing,” she says suddenly. “On the most prosaic level, I’m going to be sleeping in my own bed again. I’ll have a sky and an ocean and human beings around me. It’s not a bunker; it’s home.”The End is in UK and Irish cinemas from 28 MarchExplore more on these topicsTilda SwintonJoshua OppenheimerBerlin film festivalMusicalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But did its car parks really have to be so lavish?Oliver WainwrightFri 14 Mar 2025 07.05 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 10.21 EDTShareThink of contemporary architecture in the Gulf and you might think ofgilded towersrising from the desert, eye-popping“iconic” museums, andartificial islandscarved into ever more fanciful shapes. But, sandwiched between the petrodollar glitz of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, there is an enclave that has been quietly bucking the trend.In Bahrain’s old capital of Muharraq, a place of winding low-rise streets studded with markets and minarets, a project has been under way over the last two decades that goes against the usual penchant for brash bling. It takes the form of a two-mile (3.2km) route that meanders through the densely packed city, linking new public squares and cultural venues, combining careful conservation with daring contemporary interventions.The Pearling Pathshows how the treatment of a Unesco world heritage site doesn’t have to mean choosing between preserving a place in aspic, or resorting to Disneyfied pastiche.Anne Holtrop had one of the galleries lined with silver leaf – then cooked pots of black salt in it to speed oxidation“One of the main motivations was to protect Muharraq,” says Noura Al Sayeh, the Palestinian architect who has led the project for Bahrain’s Authority of Culture and Antiquities since 2009. “A lot of historic structures were being demolished and Unesco designation seemed like one of the only ways to protect them, while local legislation was being revised.”Theworld heritage site, inscribed in 2012, consists of 17 buildings that each relate to a different part of Bahrain’s historic pearl-diving industry, along with three offshore oyster beds and a fortress on the southern tip of the island, where pearling boats once launched. The linear route stretches from the southern shore to a museum in the north, telling the story of the pearling economy, which was Bahrain’s biggest industry until the discovery of oil in the 1930s. The crumbling coral stone buildings, beautifullyrenovated by Studio Gionata Rizzi, range from the humble home of a pearl-diver to the lavish mansions of the wealthiest merchants and ship-owning families, with their exquisitely ornamented reception rooms.View image in fullscreenDraped with a chain mail veil … the Dar Al Muhrarraq performance venue.Photograph: Bas PrincenForming an architectural breadcrumb trail, the route is marked by distinctive lamp-posts made of concrete flecked with mother of pearl and topped with pearl-shaped globes. They link a sequence ofnew public spaceswhere groves of trees shade benches and drinking fountains, providing welcome oases that come alive every evening. “They were conceived as small living rooms in the city,” says Al Sayeh. Muharraq is home to a lot of migrant workers, who live together in cramped conditions, and these squares give them space to breathe, call their family and have some time to themselves.Al Sayeh joined the project as a young architecture graduate from EPFL university in Switzerland, and she was trusted with recommending architects for the Pearling Path’s contemporary additions. The result reads like an outdoor museum of fashionable Swiss, Belgian and Dutch firms, each given space to do their thing – and, on occasion, perhaps a bit too much free rein.One of the first projects was theDar Al Muharraq, a performance venue designed by Belgian firm Office Kersten Geers David Van Severen. Its three floors are draped with a chain mail mesh veil, hoisted up like a theatre curtain to allow the open-airfjiriperformances – folk music of the pearl divers – to spill out on to the street. The same architects also worked on the squares, with Bas Smets (mastermind of the landscape plan forNotre Dame Cathedral, where they brought a similar theatrical sensibility, creating charming urban stages, where kids play ballgames while their grandparents gossip over tea.A few blocks away, the architectural volume is cranked up byValerio Olgiati, a cultish Swiss figure courted by the likes of Kanye West and Travis Scott. His monumentalPearling Path visitor centrestands with the imposing air of a pharaonic funerary complex, hemmed in by high, faceted concrete walls. A forest of minaret-like towers holds a vast concrete canopy 10 metres aloft, while an enigmatic bunker houses an exhibition space – a raw, dark concrete room with a sepulchral air.View image in fullscreenLike a small living room … a public square on the route.Photograph: Michiel De Cleene“The brief was just for a small visitor centre within the larger archaeological site,” says Al Sayeh. “Olgiati came with a proposal that covered the entire site, which was not what the brief asked for. But he was right: the project needed a larger gesture, at the scale of the city.”His huge canopy notionally covers the ruins of some old warehouses, but large cutouts in the roof mean it gives little protection from the elements. Instead, it provides a dramatic frame for what is essentially a vast outdoor room for events. During the recentMuharraq Nights, an annual festival of music, art and food, the space was heaving with families, who had come to marvel more at Olgiati’s sci-fi edifice than the ruins beneath it. They goggled and gawped, as if momentarily transported to a film set from Dune, while a band filled the air with boisterous beats.The future-primitive aesthetic continues in the renovation of the nearbyQaisariah souq, built with the elemental look of something from the Flintstones. Its simple slab roof is held up by rows of gnarled concrete boulders, which were formed by part-filling the moulds with piles of sand. It is the work of Anne Holtrop, a Dutch architect who now runs his studio from a converted warehouse nearby (and is married to Al Sayeh). He took a similarly geological approach to an office building a few streets away, where the concrete walls and floors were cast directly on to the earth. It features gigantic aluminium window shutters, similarly cast on to rough beds of sand in a foundry in the Netherlands, which make it feel like heaving a tectonic plate each time you close the blinds.View image in fullscreenTouch of alchemy … the Pearl Museum, designed by Anne Holtrop.Photograph: Anne Holtrop“I am inspired byRichard Serra,” says Holtrop. “I like the idea that architecture can be a pure sculptural act, without any drawing.” His studio is certainly more like that of a sculptor’s, awunderkammerof material experiments filled with slabs of baked glass, lumps of bronze, and a marble model for a house, which weighs more than a tonne. “I’m particularly interested in the act of forming matter using another matter,” he adds, “in the way that float glass is cast on to molten tin. I cast concrete on to sand or earth, without predetermining the form.”Most recently, Holtop has brought his alchemical touch to theSiyadi Pearl Museum, housed in the former residence of a wealthy merchant family. As well as restoring the historic property, the project includes a new block with rough textured plaster walls inside and out, giving it a semi-ruined look. “I asked the workers to throw plaster at the walls, then scrape it with the biggest beam they could find,” says Holtrop, who clearly revels in the ad-hoc possibilities that Bahrain’s informal construction culture allows. He had one of the galleries lined with silver leaf, then cooked pots of black salt to accelerate its oxidation, lending the space a dark, inky shimmer – a fitting backdrop to the lustrous pearls on show.The Pearling Path generally manages to tread the fine line between conservation and intervention, with the tough heft of the new additions mostly complementing the earthy fabric of Muharraq. But its final element, completed last year, feels like a step of architectural hubris too far. Dotting the length of the route arefour multistorey car parksdesigned by Swiss architect Christian Kerez, who seems to have interpreted the brief as an exercise in pushing the acrobatic limits of concrete to an absurdist conclusion.The slabs of his parking structures ripple and billow, like the leaves of a huge filo pastry, as if some slices of baklava from one of the local sweetshop windows had been inflated towards the sky. Standing like stacks of skateparks connected by corkscrew stairs, they were fiendishly complex to build, necessitating the drawing of 75,000 cross-sections to cut the wooden formwork moulds on site.Given that the Pearling Path celebrates the joys of walking along a pedestrianised route, it seems anathema to build these extravagant temples to the car. And many drivers appear hesitant to take their expensive SUVs on Kerez’s undulating rollercoaster ride. The structures were designed to double up as multipurpose events spaces, but it’s hard not to think that, if so much parking was essential, it would have been a better idea to bury it underground.View image in fullscreenLike a huge filo pastry … an alternative evening use is found for one of the car parks on the Pearling Path.Photograph: Iwan BaanThese extravagant automotive sculptures also add yet more concrete to the bill. For all its architectural merits, the Pearling Path can look likea gratuitous advert for carbon consumption. Were more sustainable materials considered?“There are few alternatives here,” Al Sayeh insists. “Any timber has to be imported from thousands of miles away and it doesn’t fare well in the hot, humid climate. Coral stone is now protected, and Bahrain’s only stone quarry got depleted a few years ago. Our challenge is to make the concrete more environmentally friendly, using recycled aggregate and being economic with the formwork.”The project, overall, is an admirable achievement, balancing the pressures of tourism, preservation and local amenity with rare craft and panache. For future commissions, now that Muharraq is on the architectural map, the ministry might do well to think outside the white male European stable, and use its powers to give a stage to talent closer to home.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureBahrainMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But his band’s world-building – setting resource wars in imagined cyberpunk clubs – is no less dramaticFri 14 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 14 Mar 2025 07.18 EDTShareAs a child,Daveed Diggsand his schoolfriendWilliam Hutsondrew pictures inspired by the space-age album covers of funk legends Parliament, filled with gleaming UFOs and eccentric interplanetary travellers. Diggs would grow up to become an actor, winning a Tony award as the first person to play the roles of Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson inHamilton. He’s since voiced Sebastian the crab in The Little Mermaid’s live-action remake and appeared inNickel Boys, which was nominated twice at this year’s Oscars. But away from Hollywood and Broadway, he’s still dreaming up fantastical sci-fi worlds with Hutson – now through one of the most imaginative, harrowing projects in underground rap.Along with Hutson’s college roommate Jonathan Snipes – who had a similar childhood experience, inspired by the otherworldly paintings adorning classical albums – the friends formedClippingin Los Angeles in 2010. Over Hutson and Snipes’s production, Diggs weaves blood-soaked horror stories about racial violence or fables of enslaved people in outer space. On their new album Dead Channel Sky, he raps with mechanical precision over warped rave music, creating a noirish cyberpunk world of hackers, clubgoers, future-soldiers and digital avatars.Their music has earned them nominations for sci-fi’s highest honour, the Hugo awards, and it’s made all the more distinctive by Diggs’s decision to avoid using the first person in his lyrics. “In an art form that is so self-conscious, is it still rap music if we take that out?” he says on a video call alongside his bandmates. “We discovered pretty quickly that it is, but that it also opened possibilities.” His raps feel like cinema or musical theatre, narrating action and voicing dialogue with characters of – generally – ambiguous gender and race. “What we’ve found from fans is that, because we don’t have much to do with these characters ourselves, it has allowed people to put a lot of themselves into them, to come up with reasons why this stuff is happening, and make links between songs we didn’t think of.”Implicit in this approach is a critique of mainstream hip-hop: Hutson argues that its “fiercely individualistic” bent, and obsession with authenticity, has bred conformity. “The constraints of what you’re allowed to talk about and who you’re allowed to be as a rapper are so narrow,” he says. “Nobody calls novelists inauthentic compared to memoirists – but in rap music that’s apparently the case.”Described by Hutson as a “CD compilation you’ve found in a used bin in the future”,Dead Channel Skyis therefore filled with storytelling, with Diggs playing a different character on each song. On Ask What Happened, he’s a troubled socially conscious MC listing human atrocities at warp speed, but over the mid-tempo house of Mirrorshades Pt 2, he becomes someone slick and aloof, describing a nightclub’s strict dress code: “God is not here – he forgot to rock his mirrorshades.” The characters all belong to the same destructive capitalist system, and this imagined society is at war: Welcome Home Warrior, with Diggs’s too-friendly address to “cyber rat-race escape artists”, is done as a military recruitment message.Hutson says they’re using a classic sci-fi trope, “these colonialist, extractive, brutal wars on other planets”, and it makes a fitting analogy for life in the west today, where our comforts are reliant on fought-over resources. “We are at war all the time,” Diggs adds. “It’s one of the great tricks of capitalism and technology: to allow these things to happen in the name of capitalism, with us all participating in it but not feeling like we’re affected.” His acting ability helps bring these characters to vivid life on record, but Diggs himself doesn’t disappear completely. “Any time I’m acting in something, whatever I’ve been reading, whatever I’m thinking, all that stuff finds its way into the person I’m inhabiting. The Clipping stuff is similar. Everything is in service to the story.”Plenty of reading material has informed Dead Channel Sky, especially William Gibson’s 1984 cyberpunk novelNeuromancer, which lends the album its title. Hutson says it was a horribly prescient book: “We have a lot of the technology [from Neuromancer], a version of cyberspace, and we live in a corporatist, fascist dystopia.”View image in fullscreen‘A rave is the most corporeal, embodied sense of joy’ … Clipping.Photograph: Daniel TopeteBut there are less widely known touchstones, too. The track Code samples the 1996 Afrofuturist filmThe Last Angel of History, in which a character seeks truth by consulting “techno fossils”: interviews about Black culture with speakers including techno music pioneerJuan Atkins, sci-fi authorOctavia Butlerand Parliament-Funkadelic’s George Clinton. Snipes came across the film, and like Neuromancer, found it prescient. “A hundred years from now, people are going to be finding abandoned data centres and trying to power them up and find out what’s on there,” he grins. “It’s going to be like opening King Tut’s tomb.”The trio are already well-respected in sci-fi circles. Their 2016 album Splendor & Miserywas nominated for a Hugo award– only the second musical project considered since the awards began in 1953. They got their second and third nominations for their 2017 song The Deep and its 2019 novella remake with Rivers Solomon – these imagined an underwater society populated by water-breathing descendants of enslaved people.But their latest cyberpunk theme has a particularly strong affinity with hip-hop, they say, with both forms flourishing in the 1980s. “The hacker and the hip-hop producer are both ‘hacking’ technology that wasn’t made to do what they’re doing with it,” Hutson says, referring in the latter case to turntablism and sampling. “They’re building a future out of the mass-produced garbage around them.” (The group’s friend Roy Christopher made this argument in his 2019 bookDead Precedents, exploring rap as “Black cyberpunk”.) Hutson sees those early days of hip-hop as very creatively liberated, and says the album’s different rapping styles attempt to “harken back to that time, when we didn’t really know what rap was yet. You could rap over fast stuff, slow stuff, laser sounds – all this other silliness.”‘The music industry is as cold blooded as Scrooge McDuck’: the return of rapper Yasiin BeyRead moreAs well as hip-hop, cyberpunk is closely allied with rave music – think of the club scene in the Matrix, or Underworld, Orbital and the Prodigy on the Hackers soundtrack – and so Dead Channel Sky hops between dance sub-genres, including big-beat (Change the Channel), acid-house (Keep Pushing) and drum’n’bass (Dodger). But Hutson sees “a weird contradiction” here. “A rave is the most corporeal, embodied sense of joy,” he says. “It’s not about the connectivity of the internet – it’s about being in a warehouse with a bunch of people.”This unsteady, contradictory relationship between the digital and the physical lies at the heart of Dead Channel Sky, where imagined realities prompt questions about our own: whether virtual realms of “pixelated wind” are any flimsier than ours. Diggs suggests: “If we are currently living in the apocalypse that the cyberpunk fiction of the 80s and 90s predicted, this is the music.”Dead Channel Sky is released via Sub Pop on 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsHip-hopRapElectronic musicDance musicExperimental musicScience fiction booksInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Overall, visitor numbers are about three-quarters of pre-pandemic levels which, combined with cuts to culture budgets, is putting pressure on institutions to reduce costs.Last year, Tate’s trustees approved another deficit budget to give the institution time to develop a new financially sustainable business model.About 30% of Tate’s income comes from government grants. The rest is raised through private fundraising – including corporate support, philanthropic donations and legacy bequests – as well as money from exhibition ticket sales.Tate Liverpool, which opened at the Royal Albert Dock in 1988, is undergoing a £29.7m redevelopment, which includes the installation of new galleries.Tate St Ives is restoring the Palais de Danse – Barbara Hepworth’s second studio space. In May, Tate Modern will mark its 25th birthday with free performances and events, as well as the return of Louise Bourgeois’s spider, Maman, to the Turbine Hall.The Prospect union said it was engaging with Tate on the planned changes and would support any staff affected.The union’s national secretary for heritage, Sharon Brown, said: “We are clear that the expertise and experience of museum and gallery workers, who are often underpaid and undervalued, is what brings the collections alive and is fundamental to the success of the sector.“Budget cuts and the impact of the pandemic have hit the sector hard and more must be done to invest in these institutions and the workforce, which are an essential part of our domestic and international visitor economy as well as of Britain’s cultural landscape.”Explore more on these topicsTate ModernTate BritainTate LiverpoolTate St IvesArts fundingMuseumsJob lossesnewsShareReuse this content"

Hackman’s pacemaker last showed signs of activity on 18 February, indicating an abnormal heart rhythm on the day he probably died. The couple’s bodies weren’t discovered until 26 February.Julia Peters, a representative for the estate of Hackman and Arakawa, urged a state district court in Santa Fe to seal records in the cases to protect the family’s right to privacy in grief under the 14th amendment to the US constitution, emphasising the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation, and potential for their dissemination by media.The request, filed on Tuesday, also described the couple’s discreet lifestyle in Santa Fe after Hackman‘s retirement. The state capital city is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors. The couple “lived an exemplary private life for over 30 years in Santa Fe,New Mexico, and did not showcase their lifestyle,” the petition said.New Mexico’s open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of people who have died, said Amanda Lavin, legal director at the non-profit New Mexico Foundation for Open Government. Some medical information is also not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.At the same time, the bulk of death investigations by law enforcement, and autopsy reports by medical investigators, are typically considered public records under state law to ensure government transparency and accountability, she said. “I do think it does infringe on transparency if the court were to prohibit release of all the investigation records, including the autopsies,” Lavin said on Thursday. “The whole idea of those records being available is to ensure accountability in the way those investigations are done.”“There is also a public health concern given that hantavirus was involved,” Lavin added.She said the preemptive request to prevent the release of government records on constitutional grounds is unusual.Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including The French Connection, Hoosiers and Superman from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s. Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.Explore more on these topicsFilmGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

The Cornwells also produced the award-winning adaptation of his novel The Night Manager, and are currently working on two sequel series to the hit show.If Legacy of Spies goes ahead, Macfadyen – known for his performances as Tom Wambsgans in Succession and Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice – will join hallowed ranks: Gary Oldman, Rupert Davies, Alec Guinness and Denholm Elliott have all portrayed Smiley on screen. A middle-aged, podgy, balding man described by his own wife as “breathtakingly ordinary”, Smiley is also a ruthlessly clever spymaster working in the British secret service during the cold war.The don of disillusionment: John le Carré on filmRead more“Short, fat, and of a quiet disposition, he appeared to spend a lot of money on really bad clothes, which hung about his squat frame like skin on a shrunken toad,” le Carré wrotein the first Smiley novel, Call for the Dead. Playing short might be a challenge for Macfadyen, who is 1.91 metres tall.Le Carré was very fond of Guinness’s portrayal of Smiley in 1979’s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and 1982’s Smiley’s People,once sayingthat he “so beautifully represented Smiley and left the character intact”. He also reportedlyenjoyed Oldman’s “beautiful performance” in the 2011 Tinker Tailor. But a sequel starring Oldman was reportedly blocked by le Carré’s sons, with Oldman’s managerDouglas Urbanski telling the Radio Times in September: “We’ve reached out … to le Carré’s sons and – the damnedest thing – they have no interest in Gary playing Smiley again. I don’t know why.”The explanation may well be the new show, which Variety reports has already been shopped around to various interested buyers in the US and UK.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionJohn le CarréMatthew MacfadyennewsShareReuse this content"

Censorship is always wrong.”“We made this film to reach US audiences from a wide variety of political views. I believe that once you see the harsh reality of occupation in Masafer Yatta in the West Bank, it becomes impossible to justify it, and that’s why the mayor is so afraid of No Other Land. It won’t work. Banning a film only makes people more determined to see it.According to Meiner’s newsletter, O Cinema’s CEO, Vivian Marthell, allegedly agreed to withdraw the film from programming, citing “concerns of antisemitic rhetoric”, but Meiner claimed she reversed her decision the following day. The screenings sold out and the cinema added additional dates in March.No Other Land review – powerful Israel-Palestine documentary is essential viewingRead more“Our decision to screen No Other Land is not a declaration of political alignment. It is, however, a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard,” Marthelltold the Miami Herald.Kristen Rosen Gonzalez, a Miami Beach commissioner, said she shared the mayor’s negative assessment of the film but cautioned against a “kneejerk reaction” that could trigger “costly legal battles”, and noted O Cinema’s “longstanding commitment to the Jewish community”.The documentary, which won the Academy Award for best documentary feature, follows the destruction of Palestinian villages in the occupiedWest Bankand chronicles the unlikely friendship between Abraham and Palestinian activist Basel Adra, who co-directed the film.No Other Land is beingself-distributed in the US after no distributors would pick it up, even after it won several awards and secured its Oscar nomination.“We were told that people were afraid” of distributing a film critical of the Israeli government during the war with Gaza,Abraham previously told the Guardian– despite No Other Land being filmed in the West Bank, not Gaza, and finished before Hamas’ 7 October 2023 terror attack.Meiner’s proposal to cancel the cinema’s lease is set for a commission vote next Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsFilmNo Other LandIsraelPalestinian territoriesFloridaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

It sends up not only a genre of musicals that feature teen love across the divide, from West Side Story to Grease, but acerbically pokes fun at Wasp-y values and America itself – from its constitution to its sense of exceptionalism.This first professional UK production was long overdue, and in director Mehmet Ergen’s hands it is a firecracker of a show – faster, funnier and more intelligent than so much other retro teen musical fare in the West End.It takes us to Baltimore, where the upper-class “squares” are at war with the leather-clad “drapes” – though they rather ridiculously enact their enmity through singing battles. The titular rebel Wade “Cry-Baby” Walker (Adam Davidson), in his sleeveless leather jerkin and bandana, is a drape while “good girl” Allison (Lulu-Mae Pears) is the square who instantly falls for him.View image in fullscreenLove across the class divide … Adam Davidson and Lulu-Mae Pears as Cry-Baby and Allison.Photograph: Charlie FlintWhere the 1990 film (starring an electric Johnny Depp) is more absurdist, there is more plot in the adaptation. This is an America that buzzes with McCarthyist anxiety and panic over the atomic bomb. The first scene features a polio inoculation picnic and the reprised song I’m Infected encapsulates not just the infectious nature of love but “respectable” America’s fear of a “diseased” underclass.Performances shine with eyebrow-raised irony. So do the songs by David Javerbaum and Adam Schlesinger. The music is a highly infectious mix of rockabilly, blues and swing, and lyrics explode with gleeful satire and ironies that make you laugh out loud. A small band sit on an exposed mezzanine level and create an astonishing sound.Allison looks like Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz at the start (“My grandmother told me never to loosen up. It’s not upper class”) but gathers shades of Rocky Horror’s Janet as she ventures into sexual rebellion, and Pears has a fabulous singing voice. Davidson matches her in scrubbed-faced wholesomeness as Cry-Baby, despite the bad-boy leathers, and is an impressive dancer.View image in fullscreenChris Whittaker’s choreography is sophisticated in the ensemble numbers.Photograph: Charlie FlintHis posse bring thrilling characterisation too, from pregnant Pepper (Jazzy Phoenix) to “Hatchet-Face” Mona (Kingsley Morton), while Chad Saint Louis as Dupree blows the roof off with songs such as Jukebox Jamboree, as does Eleanor Walsh as Cry-Baby’s stalker, with Screw Loose.It is all as darkly exhilarating as The Producers (the book is co-written by Mark O’Donnell and Thomas Meehan, the latter of whom also wrote the book for Mel Brooks’s musical). And like the most recent London production of that show, this is inventively staged in a modestly sized space, with performers using the entirety of the auditorium. Chris Whittaker’s choreography – an amusingly twirling pastiche – becomes more sophisticated in the ensemble numbers without seeming cramped.Robert Innes Hopkins’ set design is light on its feet, with banners raised and lowered like the American flag for changing scenes, and the star-spangled banner projected on a back wall. And who can fail to feel the bite of the last song, Nothing Bad, which insists that things couldn’t be better in America? The irony carries forward, to chime with America’s endeavour to make itself great again.At theArcola theatre, London, until 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsStageMusicalsArcola theatreJohn WatersTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The concept (already parlayed into a book and a breakout broadcasting career) now makes a faltering transfer to the stage at the Glasgow comedy festival as part of a UK tour. It confirms the 30-year-old as a cheeky and charismatic host, but exposes his taunting comedy – frequently directed tonight at people’s clothing – as itself pretty threadbare.The evening mixes standup with PowerPoint presentations based on Ali’s online work. The former draws on his family life in Lancashire, at home with a tyrant mother. The material doesn’t stray far from child-of-migrants cliche, as Ali cracks wise about the pressure to become a doctor. There’s a fine gag about the cautionary example Sajid Javid sets to young Pakistani Brits, and a confused routine about Ali’s four-year-old niece, whose privilege he deplores even as he insists that she, like him, remains poor.The PowerPoint routines, meanwhile, are by some distance sub-Dave Gorman, as Ali invites us to guess which retail items are expensive, and which are sweatshop-cheap. Here, and in another slideshow comparing outre red-carpet couture with Elmo from Sesame Street, or to “an anal prolapse”, the humour rarely extends beyond playground abuse. But it looks positively Wodehousian next to the section in which our host “roasts” audience members for their “shit outfits”. It may, as Ali insists, be “all a bit of fun”. But I’d have preferred funny.In the closing stages the show takes on a political edge, as this self-styled “King of the Povvos” critiques “poverty chic” in high fashion, and makes the legit but banal point that the lifestyles paraded on Instagram should not be muddled with the real thing. No doubt Ali’s heart is in the right place – but he’s still to prove the stage is the right place for his comedy.Touring until 5 AprilExplore more on these topicsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Played live on this sold-out tour, the lounge-lizard feeling intensifies as her band perform on what looks like an epically proportioned sofa, backed by an elegantly glinting feature wall.Clairo sweeps around in front of this bold interior decoration with a carefree second-mimosa energy, saying that she and her band are in “such high spirits” and admiring her “crazy” teen and twentysomething audience. Truth be told, this seated crowd, given to carefully filming each song on phones or fashionably ancient digital cameras and sometimes both, isn’t exactly wild. But giddy admiration gushes from them, and there’s a big, fierce singalong for early single Bags, particularly on its clever line about a battle of wits between lovers: “Can you see me using everything to hold back?”The screams intensify with a top note of disbelief as Clairo introduces Steeeam. It’s the first live airing for this song dating back to her 2020 side project Shelly, but this peppy and pleasant dream-pop feels a bit inconsequential compared with the strong, sophisticated Charm material: having broken through in her teens and charted her whole youth in music, it feels like she is now truly hitting her stride.View image in fullscreenHitting her stride … Clairo with members of her band.Photograph: Tony Olmos/The GuardianHer songs are given extra weight by her terrific band, including multi-instrumentalist Hailey Niswanger. Her flute and saxophone soloing conjure the album’s 70s mood, but it’s such spirited playing – including a positively raucous sax meltdown to close out Partridge – that it never seems like twee nostalgia. With big organ lines and bigger sofa, the band also bring to mind Stereolab and their Space Age Bachelor Pad Music.The jump in quality between Steeeam and, say, the funkily headstrong Add Up My Love is a mark of how far Clairo has come in a relatively short time, from insular bedroom ditties to this more mature sound, lavish staging, front rows at last week’s Paris fashion week and a kind of tentative extroversion. Even the older material gets swept up in this self-confidence, with the Strokes-y garage rock riff of closing song Sofia ringing out at huge new-wave proportions.At Eventim Apollo, 14 March; Glasgow Academy, 16 and 17 March; and Manchester Apollo, 19 and 20 March.Explore more on these topicsClairo (Music)Pop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Lucy Cuthbertson has trimmed one of Shakespeare’s shortest plays to the length of a football match and directs a cast who rarely seem to stop moving. The witches turn cartwheels, Sam Lyon-Behan’s fight direction is influenced by action movies and Banquo’s ghost does acrobatics, even interlinking arms with Macbeth during a roisterous ceilidh.Played without an interval, this version makes few wholesale cuts but gives each scene a nip and a tuck. There’s no Donalbain, the Porter takes the Old Man’s lines and Shakespeare’s use of repetition, including his web of interlinked imagery, is reduced. That weakens the tragedy’s usual incantatory effect and, while the production is staged with elan, it lacks any ethereal, bloodcurdling weirdness.Take those circus witches: in casual modern dress, they contort their bodies and perform tricks – at one point interlinking to form a many-limbed monster – but these are feats to make you marvel rather than tremble. Their simultaneous turning of heads and pointing of fingers just evoke pop choreography. The production’s pell-mell pace also means some speeches are rushed, notably in the aftermath of Duncan’s murder, so do not have time to get under your skin.View image in fullscreenOsborne and Hanora Kamen don the PPE as Lord and Lady Macbeth.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe momentum is aided by superb musical direction from Zands Duggan, joined on percussion by Rosie Bergonzi, with Max Gittings on bagpipes. Occasionally cranking an army siren, the musicians wear camo, as do most of the cast in the opening scenes of a production set on “a military base, somewhere in the world” that emphasises the sense of an alternative family unit. Boiling point tensions are established with a new intro in which a bungled operation results in the fatalities of innocents.Natalie Pryce’s design is as medically modern as it was for Cuthbertson’s excellentRomeo and Julietlast year. Lady Macbeth (Hanora Kamen) laboriously prepares well in advance of the murder’s mess by dressing in PPE and she fusses obsessively with a UV torch in search of stains when driven mad. The inverse of her journey from calculated to muddled is equally well handled by Patrick Osborne’s Macbeth.View image in fullscreenStaged with elan … Macbeth at Shakespeare’s Globe.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe story’s children are unflinchingly placed at the heart of this violence: Rhiannon Skerritt’s Fleance runs around with Daddy’s rifle (an affectionate bond is swiftly established with Robert Penny’s Banquo) and the Macduffs (Roxy Faridany and Roann Hassani McCloskey, playing a female couple) carry their kids in BabyBjörns, even during fight scenes. The cauldron is filled not with newts and frogs but firearms and the sisters prove bulletproof when Macbeth takes aim at them. Cuthbertson brings them back at the end, implying a cycle of violence – or perhaps more of a somersault.Principally playing Duncan, Jo Servi is also a porter to remember in a new scene written by Faith Obum-Uchendu, the winner of a student competition run by the Globe. With a series of knock, knock jokes, he questions the teenage audience’s hypocrisies about greenwashing and fast fashion, singling out a teacher’s pet for using an online essay generator. Malcolm (Simeon Desvignes), too, is charismatic among this dynamic cast.With its intelligent tweaks to exposition and clear delivery, the storytelling is always fluid but overall it’s an efficient production rather than a revelatory one.AtShakespeare’s Globe, London, until 20 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreMacbethShakespeare's GlobereviewsShareReuse this content"

By the time they confidently sashay through the multiple-movement title track, it’s clear that this is one of those great leaps forward that bands can only take by growing together over time.

Her book is partly a letter to her younger self, whom she reassures that her face and body “will settle into something you’ll be able to live with by the time you’re 30”, and a paean to readers who “clutch the moniker ‘loser’ close to [their] heart. At first, it’ll feel like a handicap, but eventually it’ll transform into a superpower, because being on the outside offers up the best vantage point from which to observe and skewer.”Akhavan narrates, her compelling delivery veering between archly amused, as she recalls her more ludicrous moments, and mournful, as she relives the damage she inflicted on herself in her formative years. At college, she had anorexia and bulimia; at this time her parents also persuaded her to have surgery to reduce the size of her nose. Eventually Akhavan joined a recovery programme for her eating disorders where she looked at the other patients and thought “what a tragic bunch of basic bitches … It took me weeks to realise they were all me. I was staring at 13 Desirees.” While this is no tale of redemption, age brings a degree of acceptance of herself and her flaws. “I’ll always be embarrassing but I’m beginning to lose my embarrassment. The sharp sting of humiliation grows dull when you realise you’re going to keep making a fool of yourself, because that’s what it is to be alive.”Available via4th Estate, 5hr19minFurther listeningEight WeeksLola Young, Penguin Audio, 8hr23minBaroness Young reads her account of growing up in the British care system, being rejected by her birth parents and her path to the House of Lords.MiddlemarchGeorge Eliot, SNR Audio, 32hr41minEliot’s sweeping tale of industry and social change, as witnessed by the residents of a fictional town in the Midlands, is read by Lucy Scott.Explore more on these topicsBooksAudiobook of the weekAutobiography and memoirreviewsShareReuse this content"

Quite apart from the explicit references to the village in which he lives on The Bridge Hotel, he sings elsewhere of “winding my way back home”.There’s also a sense of reckoning. The title track alludes to the speech problems caused by his ill health: “Back when the words came easily/ I had the answer to everything”, something also touched upon onKnowledge. Indeed, his lyrics are equally thoughtful and thought-provoking throughout, the musicianship sensitive and never seizing the spotlight from his still distinctive baritone. Paper Planes and It Must Be Real are particularly beautifully realised; the rousing The Heart Is a Foolish Little Thing conceals rueful and tender sentiments. Collins has just announceda farewell tourfor the autumn. One has to hope this compassionate, empathetic record is not his farewell album too.Watch the video for The Heart Is a Foolish Little Thing by Edwyn Collins.Explore more on these topicsEdwyn CollinsThe ObserverPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Gently satirical, with nods to the Nouvelle Vague, Jacques Tati and the New Yorker, it’s a feast for the eyes.SWLive sportWomen’s Super League FootballLiverpool v Man Utd, 7.05pm, BBC Three.From Anfield.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightBill BaileyKrishnan Guru-MurthyClaudia WinklemanAlan CarrAmanda HoldenKevin CostnerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A cross between Spielberg’s AI: Artificial Intelligence and Toy Story, it’s set in the aftermath of a human v robot war that humans won due to neural headsets invented by Stanley Tucci’s tech grandee. Millie Bobby Brown is our heroine, an orphan who goes on a quest into the “exclusion zone”, where the sentient machines are corralled, after a little robot turns up claiming to be her dead brother. Chris Pratt is a dodgy trader (with a heart of gold, naturally) who accompanies her into a land of weird and wonderful bots, voiced by the likes of Anthony Mackie, Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox.Out now, NetflixBridesmaidsView image in fullscreenGoing to the chapel … (from left) Melissa McCarthy, Ellie Kemper, Rose Byrne, Wendi Mclendon-Covey, Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig in Bridesmaids.Photograph: Universal Pictures/Allstar“It’s coming out of me like lava!” This2011 comedyis justly famous for one particular food poisoning scene, but it’s a hoot from start to finish. A career high for its director, Paul Feig, and most of the cast, it stars Kristen Wiig (who also co-wrote) as the sad’n’single Annie, who is asked by Maya Rudolph’s Lillian to be her maid of honour. She soon finds herself in a competition with Rose Byrne’s prettier, richer Helen for Lillian’s favour – which leads to a series of disasters. Melissa McCarthy steals the show, which is some feat in such august comic company.Saturday 15 March, 9pm, ITV2SkincareView image in fullscreenGlow-up … Elizabeth Banks as Hope Goldman in Skincare.Photograph: Universal PicturesHope (Elizabeth Banks) is a perma-smiling beautician to the stars in LA, and is about to launch a new product line when a competitor opens up across the street. Soon, she is getting anonymous calls, her tyres are slashed and her email account is hacked. Assuming the rival is to blame she fights back, aided by “life coach” friend Jordan (Lewis Pullman). But appearances can be deceptive. A mix ofwoman-in-peril thrillerand beauty industry satire, its success rests on Banks’s finely contoured performance, alternately fierce and fragile.Sunday 16 March, 10pm, Sky Cinema PremiereThe Ghost and Mrs MuirView image in fullscreenRomantic fantasy … Rex Harrison and Gene Tierney in The Ghost and Mrs Muir.Photograph: Cinetext/20 Century Fox/AllstarJoseph Mankiewicz’s romantic fantasy may be set in a Californian approximation of 1900s England, with accents to match, but it’s also a touching drama about life’s ebbs and flows. Gene Tierney plays the titular widow, Lucy, who moves with her daughter and servant to a house on the coast haunted by Capt Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison). After she flatly refuses to be spooked by him, they become close. Harrison’s salty sea-dog character – all “belay” this and “blasted” that – skirts cliche initially but gains pathos when George Sanders’s comically lascivious suitor appears.Wednesday 19 March, 11am, Film4skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In David Lowery’s “mostly true” UScrime dramaset in 1981, Robert Redford oozes charm as gentleman bank robber Forrest Tucker. He and his two ageing colleagues steal their way across the US south in a warm-hearted, elegaic story of a man who is a thief by vocation. There are sly nods to the western world of the Sundance Kid, while Sissy Spacek is the woman who may – or may not – finally change his mind.Thursday 20 March, 7.15pm, Film4BirdyView image in fullscreenTraumatic … Nicolas Cage and Matthew Modine in Birdy.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyA neglected entry in the slew of Vietnam war movies released in the 1980s, Alan Parker’s drama is an affecting tale of childhood friendship and trauma, with a cracking Peter Gabriel score.Nicolas Cagethrows his all into the role of injured US soldier Al (he even had two teeth extracted to simulate his character’s facial injury) who visits his old best mate, mute war veteran Birdy (Matthew Modine), in a military psychiatric facility.

Who would believe it! This series fromShondalandis a quirky whodunnit about a mysterious death at the heart of US power. Uzo Aduba stars as Cordelia Cupp, a brilliant, eccentric detective who is charged with unpicking the details. As the body of the building’s chief usher is discovered, a state dinner is in full swing. Soon, Cupp (a keen birder whose binoculars come in handy for professional reasons too) brings searching questions and inconvenient truths to the occasion. It’s a gently comic genre piece; essentially a country house murder mystery with West Wing bells on. And it’s great fun, largely thanks to Aduba’s wry central performance.Netflix, from Thursday 20 MarchHappy FaceView image in fullscreenFace off … Dennis Quaid as Keith Jesperson and Annaleigh Ashford as Melissa Reed in Happy Face.Photograph: Katie Yu/Paramount+A meta true-crime drama about a true-crime podcast.Annaleigh Ashfordplays Melissa G Moore, a woman who discovered her father was a serial killer (“Happy Face”) at the age of 15.

The Simpsons is clearly never going to be either cancelled or abandoned by its creators but nor will it ever again feel like appointment viewing. However, despite a longstanding sense of wheelspin, the show does still conjure moments of invention and originality. These five new episodes mark the beginning of the 36th season; look out for a self-referential tangle with ChatGPT creativity and, perhaps inevitably, a White Lotus spoof in which the family go on a fancy holiday.Disney+, from Monday 17 MarchInsideView image in fullscreenThe first series was a YouTube sensation … Inside.Photograph: NetflixFor the uninitiated, the Sidemen are a group of seven goofy, hyperactive internet personalities who compete with each other in reality TV-style challenges. Their first series of Inside was a sensation on YouTube – and given that the group boast more than 130 million subscribers between them, it’s easy to see why Netflix might want a piece of the action. The format is familiar: celebrities are confined in a house and face challenges influenced by everything from Big Brother to I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here, with a prize pot that is a chunky £1m.Netflix, from Monday 17 MarchHigh HoopsView image in fullscreenTeenage kicks … (from left) Arthur Kay, Dylan Lakhanpaul, Isha Kaur Athwal, Darci Hull, Frankie-Jae Simmonds and Ella Bernstein in High Hoops.Photograph: Matt Squire/BBC/CanCan Productions LtdA Peep Show take on kids’ telly? Not quite, but this CBBC comedy does star Robert Webb and Isy Suttie, alongside likable teenage lead Darci Hull. It’s the story of Aoife, a tall, slightly gawky teen with an unusual dress sense whose plan to fit in at a new school seems to revolve round her basketball ability. However, even on their first day, Aoife and her sardonic brother Conor have managed to irritate the various cliques (mean girls, bullies etc) and their quest for approval seems doomed. But Conor’s brains and Aoife’s guileless charm help them find a way.

Walking the couple of easy miles along the coast between Kynance and Lizard Point will offer you a variety of exceptional, eye-catching and, in some cases, rare plants includingErica vagans, a variety of heath only found on the Lizard peninsula. Wildlife thrives here and in late spring your walk is likely to feature the soundtrack of Cornish choughs overhead. You may even see an adder or catch a glimpse of seals “bottling” (bobbing) in the Atlantic, enjoying the Cornish spring sunshine.Layla AstleyNorth Yorkshire in bloomView image in fullscreenCrocuses in bloom at Knaresborough Castle.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAA spring trip to Knaresborough is a must. Take a wander around this Yorkshire market town before dropping down to the gorge below, through the beautiful blossoming castle grounds. Hours can be whiled away at the Riverside Cafe, and from here you can hire a rowing boat or simply watch those already on the water, slow motion collisions and all. When it’s time to walk off the cake you can wander along theNidderdale Greenway– it’s four miles to Harrogate along this old railway line.

This 180-mile route winds through lush woodlands, rolling countryside, and along tranquil rivers. In spring, the hedgerows bloom with primroses and wild garlic, while otters and kingfishers appear along the River Taw. Stop in charming villages such as Instow for fresh seafood or picnic in a hidden meadow. For an extra thrill, kayak a peaceful stretch of the river at high tide. The trail’s quiet beauty and wildlife make it a perfect off-the-beaten-track escape as nature awakens.MeganBeat the midges in the HighlandsView image in fullscreenLochan na h-Achlaise on Rannoch Moor.Photograph: FedevPhoto/Getty ImagesMid-April to early May are ideal for walking in the Scottish Highlands, before the curse of midges. For a superb vista, take the train to Rannoch station and walk across Rannoch Moor to the recently upgradedKingshouse hotelat the head of Glencoe. An overnight stay in their bunkhousewill cost £54 a head B&B. Then walk south the next day along the old packhorse track to rejoin the train-line at Bridge of Orchy.Susannah ClarkWild walks in Little Switzerland,ShropshireView image in fullscreenCarding Mill valley and the Long Mynd in spring.Photograph: Chris Griffiths/Getty ImagesChurch Stretton in the Shropshire Hills is a marvellous place to spend a spring weekend. The town itself has a charming high street, with delis, pubs, bookshops and an indoor antiques market, but best of all is the countryside. The Long Mynd looms over the town and offers beautiful walks, wild ponies and spectacular views. The Carding Mill Valley feels surprisingly Alpine, hence the area’s nickname of Little Switzerland. There are easy train connections to historic Shrewsbury and foodie Ludlow. We stayed in a delightfulwood lodgeabove town in the trees.

The warming Gulf Stream waters bring in waves that give it the name ofthe Hawaii of Scotland. Cowslips and crocuses greeted me as I headed to the white sand beaches and stunning views of the open Atlantic – there is nothing between Tiree and the Canadian coast. Spring lambs and rabbits graced the flat fields of bluebells as I marched on for an invigorating walk on the sands. A local crofter suggested a boat tour out to uninhabited Longa Island – telling me spring was the perfect time to see Hebridean nature and wildlife at its best. Soon I was enjoying the company of perky puffins and singing seabirds – after following the farmer’s advice to lie on my stomach and imitate the movements of a seal not to scare them.

In spring it sings with birdlife and wildflowers. Visit in May for a chance of puffin-spotting on the Farne Islands. If you’re lucky you’ll also see dolphins, and grey seals are abundant. Northumberland is home to a wonderful array of flora including, in late spring, wild orchids. Low Newton-by-the-Sea is an excellent base with an atmospheric pub, the Ship, serving local ale andstottie sandwiches, among other delights. Lindisfarne is another must see – just make sure you check the tides before setting out across the causeway.SuziBluebells on the edge of LondonView image in fullscreenBluebells in Epping Forest.Photograph: JBLumix/Getty ImagesIf Covid-19 taught me one thing, it was to appreciate how much exploring can be done locally. I was aware that Epping Forest was on my doorstep, but hadn’t appreciated the volume of trails, and who knew that Lawrence of Arabia owned 18 acres at Pole Hill, one of the highest points. We also discovered a community nature park, the Paddock, in our neighbouring borough, with clumps of spring primroses and cowslips, and theParkland Walk, which follows a former railway line. And finally, we hunted down bluebells in Wanstead Park and Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park, one of London’s “magnificent seven” of Victorian cemeteries.Helen JacksonStratford drama as the riverside comes aliveView image in fullscreenStratford-upon-Avon.Photograph: Tu xa Ha Noi/Getty ImagesSpring is the perfect time to visit Stratford-upon-Avon, when blossoms line the riverbanks and the town’s Elizabethan architecture transports you back in time. Start your day on the River Avon with a self-drive wooden punt from Avon Boating (£11pp) – a peaceful way to take in the views. Then, step back in time at Shakespeare’s birthplace, or take a walk in the leafy Welcombe Hills. As evening falls, catch a world-class performance at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, and round off the day with a meal at the Vintner, an independent bistro set in a historic building on Sheep Street.StephWinning tip: puffins and chips in Ballycastle, County AntrimView image in fullscreenBallycastle has a ‘magnificent’ beach writes our tipster, Eve.Photograph: Ballygally View Images/Getty ImagesBallycastle has a magnificent beach but was never served by direct trains from Belfast so didn’t develop like a resort. It is a very pleasant market town on the coast so doesn’t feel desolate outside the summer months. Its ferry serves Rathlin Island and from spring the cliffs at the famous “upside down” West Lighthouse are covered with puffins. Back at port, dinner at the famous Morton’s chip shop will soon get your sea legs back. Ballycastle was poorly served for hotels but this is now changing. The newSalthouse hotel(doubles from £190 B&B) overlooks the town and is worth a visit for the food alone.EveView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysReaders' travel tipsShort breaksTop 10sWalking holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has a Basque-born chef, Adam Iglesias, who has worked atAlameda near San Sebastiánin Spain, as well asBrat,BarrafinaandSessions Arts Clubin London. There you go: a plethora of foodie plus-points already.Then there’s the fact that it’s in a recently lavishly restored pub that feels a bit like an AI interpretation of theQueen Vic in EastEnders: there’s a horseshoe bar, traditional wooden panelling, ales on tap, lots of standing room, a big TV screen for the sport and … wait! What? An iced seafood counter? Well, that’ll be for the lobsters, carabineros, sea urchins and other fishy things to eat in the elegant, white table-clothed dining room just past the bar’s standing area. Possibly you’ll eat those urchins, or perhaps a devilled egg, topped with the Prince Arthur’s in-house caviar, sourced viathe London Caviar company. This place goesbigon caviar, with 50g of Siberianbaeriiserved with turbot-dripping potatoes and creme fraiche priced at £100.View image in fullscreenThe Prince Arthur’s gildas: ‘I was smitten.’You’ll have noticed that I have not called the Prince Arthur a gastropub, despite it clearly being gastronomical and being housed inside something resembling a pub. That’s because we need a new name for this type of highfalutin hospitality venture. With pubs across the UK closing at a rate of knots, the days of publicans rebranding as simply “one of them gastropubs” to survive are over. At one time, slinging a few £20 plates of beef cheek on polenta at customers and screwing a bottle of Aesop Resurrection hand soap to the toilet wall may have saved your soul, but not any more. Welcome to the bright new dawn of the turbo-bougie boozer.Yes, the Prince Arthur has the framework of a pub, with Jeremy Clarkson’s Hawkstone beer on tap and pig’s ear bar snacks and posh scotch eggs with mustard. But it is essentially a very sophisticated, Basque-influenced restaurant that servestxangurrocrab, Galician beef rib and whole turbot with glossy, palepil pilsauce, withtorrijasand Basque cheesecake for afters. Please keep in mind that this is just downstairs; the new upstairs dining room promises to be even fancier.View image in fullscreenThe Prince Arthur serves its turbot with a ‘world-class’ pil pil sauce.None of this, I must stress, is to my disliking. Ten minutes into lunch at this utterly lovable mega-posh pretend pub, and you will find yourself planning your return. From the first plate of gildas – skewered glossy olives, intricately folded anchovies and curls of green chilli pepper – I was smitten. These could be the world’s best pintxo gildas, living their best lives in a back street near Victoria coach station. Then two neat squares of those fish-dripping potatoes with sea urchin, tuna and caviar. The devilled egg is a work of art: a boiled egg standing upright on the plate, its yolk creamed and piped back into it, then topped with more caviar.Suffice to say that by this point the bill was creeping up alarmingly, even though I could have balanced everything I’d eaten up to then on the back of a credit card. For mains, we shared that turbot, which was perfectly cooked and came with a world-class pil pil emulsification. A side of winter greens was disappointingly over-salted, though. Much better was a plate of wood-grilled pepper, a slimy, smoky mass of sweet, vivid, red loveliness.The Prince Arthur is by no means cheap, but it’s worth it for a special occasion. The service is good, it’s in a beautiful room with a fascinating clientele of Belgravia locals who certainly don’t need to save the place for special occasions and, above all, the cooking is wonderful, especially if seafood is your thing.View image in fullscreenThe Prince Arthur’s take on the classic Basque cheesecake: ‘I could almost feel the northern Spanish sun on my face.’And, of course, there’s that cheesecake, one of my favourite desserts ever, though I usually only ever eat it in summer, ideally in San Sebastián itself, where the temperature lends itself to a wander around the streets, pausing to eat wobbly, custardy, melting cheesecake out of a box. The Belgravia version was 99% there, and came with a thick winter berry sauce and enough caramelisation that I could almost feel the northern Spanish sun on my face.There’s a lot to love about this restaurant, although, eventually, I fear, all surviving “pubs” will be like the Prince Arthur. House caviar on the menu, £25 a pop carabinero prawns on the grill, Sky Sports on the big screen, and anyone remotely normally waged standing outside in the cold, staring through the window like Hans Christian Anderson’s Little Match Girl, striking matches one by one while watching the world burn.The Prince Arthur11 Pimlico Road, London SW1, 020-3098 6060.

Take English sparkling wine. Once a prestige product that only in-the-knows could pick up from specialist retailers, it’s now reaching a wider consumer audience than ever thanks to the supermarkets.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Many supermarkets have even developed their own-label English sparkling wines, which they buy in and bottle under their own name. Sometimes they divulge which producer they sourced them from and sometimes they don’t (especially if the brand in question feels that association with a supermarket might cheapen its reputation). Crucially, however, they’re much cheaper than regular English sparklers, which tend to go for at least £30-40.If you’re confused by those regular prices, I get it. Prosecco, for instance, is made hundreds of miles away, yet you can still get hold of an own-label supermarket bottle for as little as £5, so I can well understand why those premium prices are a bit of a barrier for those who are curious to try the stuff.English sparkling is grown closer to home, sure, but it is also much more costly to produce, and for all manner of reasons. First, labour costs here are much higher than in many other countries, where in some cases workers are deliberately underpaid. Just last year, for example,an investigation into champagne productionfound workers being paid way below the French minimum wage, with some even returning home with no money at all.Then there’s the cost of pretty much everything else. Have you ever bought a house? Lucky you. Now imagine buying one that costs millions and you can’t even live in it. It’s not a sofa from the DFS sale that you have to furnish it with, either, but a €25,000 pneumatic press. And if the land doesn’t come with one, you then have to build a winery, too. In the UK, these things are not generally inherited, as they might be elsewhere, and all are costs that need somehow to be recouped.But now most supermarkets sell an own-label English sparkler, some of them for as little as £14. So are these cheaper wines lesser in quality? I asked Henry Jeffreys, whosenewsletteris often loaded with English wine facts, secrets and hot gossip. (He’s also gota podcast on wine history, if that’s an itch you fancy scratching.) “For some producers, such asBalfourandDenbies, making supermarket wine is part of their business model,” he says. “For others, it’s a way of dealing with overstocks from big vintages such as 2020 or 2023. And when wines are made to a budget like that, they might be made from young vines, non-champagne varieties or spend less time onlees. That doesn’t necessarily mean they are worse, though; they’re just made differently.”He adds thatcharmatmethod wines – also known as tank method, and the same used in prosecco production – are significantly cheaper to produce than traditional champagne method wines. M&S’s Bramble Hill is one that does this method justice: it is exuberant, limey and great fun.Four bottles of English fizzTesco Finest English Sparkling Wine£21, 11.5%. Generous, ripe and brioche-y blend of champagne varieties made by Balfour.Bowler & Brolly English Sparkling Wine£17.99 Aldi, 12%.

It’s a similar concept to mulled wine, but the herbs and spices (tosoan) are specifically selected to protect against illness and evil spirits, and to usher in good fortune. The tosoan used varies greatly, with everyone making their own proprietary selection, so use those listed here as a guide and adapt to suit personal taste. Ours includes clove to reduce inflammation, cinnamon bark to aid digestion and citrus to soothe the stomach, while the sake itself helps promote blood circulation. It is not uncommon to dilute spiced sake with green tea to taste.Spiced sakeServes21 clove1 star anise½ cinnamonstick, plus 2 whole sticks, to garnish2 wide strips fresh orange peel1¼cm piece fresh ginger15g brown sugarThe juice of ¼ orange, plus 2 slices orange, to garnish360ml sake⁠Roast the spices, orange peel and ginger in a dry pan over a medium heat until they smell fragrant. ⁠Add the sugar and orange juice, then stir and leave to bubble until slightly caramelised.⁠Add the sake and warm gently, then strain into small cups or glassware.
