Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under…— Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)March 4, 2025Alarmed European leaders reaffirmed their backing for Kyiv on Tuesday as it emerged that Ukraine’s Nato allies had not been told in advance of the suspension of US aid.A spokesperson for the Polish foreign ministry said Trump’s announcement “was made without any information or consultation, neither with Nato allies nor with the Ramstein group which is involved in supportingUkraine”.Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, announced proposals to increase EU defence spending, which she said could raise up to €800bn ($848bn). “This is a moment for Europe, and we are ready to step up,” she said.In his comments, Zelenskyy sketched out a plan for how the war might stop. The “first stages” could include a release of prisoners and a ban on missiles and long-range drones used to attack energy and civilian infrastructure. This “truce in the air” might be applied to the sea as well, he said, “ifRussiawill do the same”.Zelenskyy’s post came hours after theTrump administrationsaid it was blocking all deliveries of ammunition, vehicles and other equipment, including shipments agreed when Joe Biden was president.He acknowledgedhis meeting on Friday with Trump and the US vice-president, JD Vance, “did not go the way it was supposed to”. He said: “It is regrettable it happened this way. It is time to make things right. We would like future cooperation and communication to be constructive.”But his conciliatory comments appear to fall short of the grovelling apology demanded by the White House. Trump has accused Zelenskyy of disrespect, and the US president’s aides have claimed Zelenskyy provoked the row by insisting any peace deal had to comewith security guarantees. Vance also repeatedly accused Ukraine’s president of ingratitude.By way of response on Tuesday, Zelenskyy thanked Trump for providing Kyiv with Javelin missiles during his first presidential term. “We really do value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,” he said.On Tuesday, Vance denied that Trump wanted a public apology from Zelenskyy despite media reports to the contrary, saying that the “public stuff” did not matter as much as Ukrainian engagement toward a “meaningful settlement”.“We need the Ukrainians privately to come to us and say: ‘This is what we need. This is what we want. This is how we’re going to participate in the process to end this conflict,’” Vance told reporters on Capitol Hill. “That is the most important thing, and that lack of private engagement is what is most concerning.”US officials have said Zelenskyy and an adviser, Andriy Yermak, had sought the White House meeting despite theconcerns of some Trump adviserswho had said there was the potential for a clash. But there are also suspicions the White House was looking for a pretext to distance itself from Ukraine.At a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening, Trump is expected to propose plans to “restore peace around the world”. A White House official told Fox News he would “lay out his plans to end the war in Ukraine”, as well as plans to negotiate the release of hostages held in Gaza, the outlet reported.Ukraine and the US were supposed to sign a minerals deal that would have resulted in the US investing in Ukraine’s underdeveloped minerals and mining sector. Trump has said the presence of US workers in Ukraine would be enough to deter Putin from future acts of aggression, with no further security promises needed.Asked whether he believed there was still hope for the minerals deal, Vance responded: “Yeah, I certainly do.” He added: “And I think the president is still committed to the mineral deal. I think we’ve heard some positive things, but not yet, of course, a signature from our friends in Ukraine.”Kyiv was ready to sign the deal “in any time and in any convenient format”, Zelenskyy indicated. “We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively,” he wrote.“It’s a temporary pause and it’s to do a reset,” Mike Johnson, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, said of the suspension of US military aid. “I am heartened by the development that President Zelenskyy has indicated that he does want to do this deal after all … I certainly encourage that to happen and he needs to come and make right what happened last week – the shocking developments in the Oval Office – and if he does that then I think this is the win-win-win scenario for everyone involved.”Moscow celebrated Trump’s decision to suspend military aid as “the best possible step towards peace”, with the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying the US had been “the main supplier of this war so far”.Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, told a cabinet meeting in Warsaw that Europe faced unprecedented risks, including “the biggest in the last few decades when it comes to security”. Tusk said his government would have to make some “extraordinary” decisions. “A decision was announced to suspend the US aid for Ukraine, and perhaps start lifting sanctions on Russia. We don’t have any reason to think these are just words,” he said.“This puts Europe, Ukraine, Poland in a more difficult situation,” Tusk said, adding that Warsaw was determined to “intensify activities in Europe to increase our defence capabilities” while maintaining the best possible relations with the US.France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said the US decision meant it was vital Europe helped Ukraine hold the frontline against Russia, which he said was “the first line of defence for Europe and France”. The time had come for Europe to drop its dependency on US weapons, he added. “We are faced with a choice that is imposed on us, between effort and freedom, or comfort and servitude,” he told MPs.The French prime minister, François Bayrou, said the US decision to suspend weapons aid in wartime signalled that Washington was “abandoning Ukraine and letting the aggressor win” and that it was Europe’s responsibility to replace them.Bayrou told parliament that Europeans “are going to have to think about our model, about our priorities and to look at the world differently … We have seen it is more dangerous than we had though, coming from those we thought were allies.”Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said: “Two things are now essential for peace through strength: additional aid – military and financial – for Ukraine, which is defending our freedom. And a quantum leap to strengthen our EU defence.”EU leaders are scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss afive-part, €800bn (£660bn) planpresented by the European commission to bolster Europe’s defence industry, increase military capability and help provide urgent military support for Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyTrump administrationUS politicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s why I met on Friday with UK defence companies and companies operating in the UK to work on how we can increase the capacity and the capability,” she said.“I am determined that as we spend that money on that defence and security, that we use it in a way that can also help stimulate the economy, and particularly to revive some parts of the country that do often feel like they’re left behind.”Speaking at a conference in London on Tuesday held by the manufacturing trade body Make UK, Reeves ducked questions from the media about whether Britain could still trust the US as a military partner under Trump’s administration.The UK’s nuclear weaponry relies heavily on cooperation with the US, as does an array of other British military hardware including F-35 fighter jets and Apache attack helicopters.“The UK and the US in terms of security and defence are closely intertwined, they are our closest partners on defence and security and that will continue to be the case,” she said.It comes after MPs reacted with fury afterJD Vanceappeared to describe a proposed Anglo-French peace deployment to Ukraine as “20,000 troops from some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years”.Reeves also suggested the UK would not withdraw from a close military industrial relationship with the US.“We’ll always have a need to buy things from abroad. I don’t want to pull up the drawbridge. But as we spend more on defence I want to see that benefit for the UK economy and UK jobs.”Britain spent £32bn directly with UK and overseas industry, with most spent on domestic contracts, and outside London and the south-east. However, billions of pounds is also spent with foreign governments, including the US.Alongside additional defence spending the chancellor is also preparing to retool the £27.8bn National Wealth Fund, which had primarily been earmarked for green projects, so it can also be spent on defence.Reeves also said Britain’s economy will be hurt by a G7 trade war even if Trump exempts the UK from tariffs.“It’s absolutely the case that even if tariffs aren’t applied to the UK, we will be affected by slowing global trade, by a slower GDP growth and by higher inflation than otherwise would be the case,” she said.“I’ve always been really clear that I believe strongly that free trade is good for exporters and importers for both countries on the sides of a trade deal. So I don’t want to see tariffs increased. I don’t think it serves anyone well.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyRachel ReevesEconomicsDefence policyTax and spendingJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

We, and our dedicated team of staff has strived to overcome numerous challenges to continue to bring joy to families and visitors across the region and country.“Unfortunately, we could no longer see a sustainable way forward and will seek to improve our other parks using the assets and where possible team elsewhere.“We are aware that Oakwood has been a much-loved destination for generations and a rite of passage for many young visitors. It is for this reason we feel such a sense of sadness.“We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the dedication and commitment of our team members past and present, suppliers and contractors who have loyally supported us and of course all those that have visited Oakwood Theme Park over the years. We are sincerely grateful.”View image in fullscreenAerial view of the Hydro ride at Oakwood Theme Park in Narberth, Pembrokeshire, west Wales.Photograph: Matthew Horwood/AlamyOakwood Theme Park had been closed for the winter season, but was due to reopen for the 2025 season.In 2004, 16-year-old Hayley Williamsdied after falling out of her seatwhile on top of the Hydro water ride as it began an almost vertical 30-metre descent into a plunge pool.She died of internal injuries.

The belief in a close relationship between western Europe and the US that has dominated government policy in, for instance, Berlin, Helsinki, London and Rome is being put under intolerable strain.The pressure is especially acute for Keir Starmer, much lauded for the calmness with which he has tried to retain focus on the essential objective of keeping the US in alliance with Europe over the sovereignty and independence ofUkraine.The task is so difficult because the British military, political, intelligence and foreign policy establishment has made practical support for Ukraine a centrepiece of its Russian policy for over a decade. Now Britain’s greatest ally seems set on the destruction of that decade’s work. For the Foreign Office this is not just disorientating, but akin to suddenly living in a world without maps.When Starmer was asked on Monday afternoon by the Scottish National party MP Stephen Flynn about reports that Trump was about to withdraw aid from Ukraine, the British prime minister replied he had not seen those reports, assuring “that is not their position”.Not many hours later, Trump’s supposed confidant in Europe was on the phone to the US president – and Downing Street will not say whether he informed Starmer of his plan even then. Moreover, reports started appearing that the US was about to lift some sanctions on Russia, a step that would lift the siege on the Russian economy so painfully constructed over the past three years.Trump’s steps are an undeniable reverse for Starmer, for the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and for all those cast in the role of “Trump whisperer” or bridge between Europe and Washington. But even now they insist there is no alternative but to remain engaged, and to urge Trump to understand his hectic timetable to a ceasefire benefits only Russia.Yet late last week it appeared as if advocates of engagement were winning, since the Starmer trip to Washington had gone as well as possible. The theatrical production of an envelope containing an invitation from King Charles to a state visit and the promise to raise defence spending by 2027 was met with the suggestion of a free trade deal that would probably put the UK in a better position than the EU. The holy grail – known as the benefit of Brexit – had finally been found.But like Emmanuel Macron, who had travelled to Washington two days before, the unhappy truth was that Trump had evaded Starmer’s central request to provide a US military backstop to a European force operating inside Ukraine after a ceasefire. The only security guarantee that was needed, Trump insisted, was the guarantee that the US would have an economic stake in the future of Ukraine’s rare earth and energy resources.No amount of summit optics could avoid Trump’s refusal to commit US military assets. Nor was it possible to overlook that US diplomats on the day of Macron’s visit twice voted with Russia at the UN, both at the general assembly and the security council.As Bronwen Maddox, the Chatham House director, pointed out: this was the first time the US had voted against Europe on a matter of European security since 1945.The abuse administered to Volodymyr Zelenskyy two days after Starmer’s visit – although a diplomatic disaster best avoided – was merely a confirmation that Trump will let nothing and no one stand in the way of his strategic aim of restoring relations with Vladimir Putin.The abandonment of Ukraine, fuelled by Trump’s personal animosity to Zelenskyy and the cost of the war to the US, has become a means to the greater end, a new relationship with Russia.It is here – according to the interpretation of Russia – that tensions with Europe are at breaking point. Where Trump draws on his personal relations with Putin to insist Russia will abide by a ceasefire, Europe instead looks at Russia’s practice of breaking agreements, the point Zelenskyy sought to make in the Oval Office with disastrous effect.Where Trump sees a convivial leader an ocean away, Europe sees a tyrant on its borders. Where Trump sees peace, Europe sees subjugation. These are not perceptions that Starmer can square.Take Finland, a new member of the Nato alliance that is sharing a border with Russia. Speaking at Chatham House on Tuesday, its foreign minister, Elina Valtonen, laid out with calm precision that for all Finland’s Atlanticist instincts, it could not accept a peace that meant submission.“There can be no sustainable peace in Ukraine without a strong and sovereign Ukraine,” she said.“This is not just the political reality, it is a moral imperative. Rushing to a deal at the cost of its content, and without due consideration of the consequences, would endanger not only Ukraine, but also Europe – and, by extension, the United States for generations to come.“We Finns know Russia. Russia shares a land border with 14 countries. Only one of them has constantly remained an independent democracy through the second world war and the cold war, and that’s Finland.“History has taught us that Russia respects only strength and resolve. Russia’s current war is based on imperialistic ambitions that go beyond Ukraine. The Kremlin’s appetite does not diminish when fed, it only grows.“Take it from us. Whatever happens in this war, Russia will remain a long-term strategic threat to Euro Atlantic security, rather than encouraged.”Valtonen said there was a need to be open for re-engagement in the future, if Russia starts to adhere to international law again. “But going forward, it would be a mistake to let go about deterrence or rebuild strategic dependency on Russia, and this goes for all of Europe.”She warned: “One of our foremost diplomats and later president, [Juho Kusti] Paasikivi, was on several occasions on the other side of the table from Stalin and Molotov when our existence as an independent country was on the line in the 1930s and 1940s.“He summed it up well: ‘The constant policy of the Russians is to get what they can with as little as possible and then come back asking for more … they never sacrifice their immediate interests for future objectives … they are immune to any ethical, human or abstract legal factors.’“This is the Finnish experience. The Ukrainians know from their own experience that Russia has broken every single commitment they have ever made on Ukraine’s sovereignty. No agreement with Moscow can stand without the will and the means to enforce it.”But despite this clear-eyed assessment of Russia, shared by the Baltic nations, Valtonen, like Starmer and indeed many European politicians, is still reluctant to criticise Trump in public.Valtonen admits this is because Europe may not yet have the strength to act alone. “We need the Americans. We need the Americans militarily, but especially also to keep up the sanctions pressure, because the worst thing that could happen now is that the US says ‘let’s get off the sanctions’ and starts engaging with Russia economically, because that would be exactly the wrong cause of action now,” she said.Diplomats admit that the speed with which Trump is moving in comparison with deliberative Europe is a problem.Quite how a coalition of the willing – led by one leader long committed to Europe’s autonomy and another committed to the primacy of the Atlantic alliance - can develop is unclear.The addition to the coalition leadership of an incoming German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, means the trajectory is moving slowly towards a European preparedness to try to help Ukraine survive without the US. Germany has a leading role in providing air defence systems to Ukraine and Merz’s remarks so far suggest he wants to take a more robust stance than his SDP predecessor, Olaf Scholz.If so it is possible the advocates of engagement with Trump are losing the internal arguments as the decisions and insults pile up. Some of this is human emotion and the hand of history.The New Zealand high commissioner, Phil Goff, recalls Winston Churchill famously denouncing Neville Chamberlain, saying: “You were given the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, and you will have war.” Goff then added: “Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office, but do you think he really understands history?”Or take the anger of the Lithuanian politician Vytautas Landsbergis at the treatment of Zelenskyy: “They called the guest in, beat him up, spat on him, and threw him out the door.” What would he have done? “I would have listened silently to everything they said and said one word at the end: liars.”But it is also the accumulation of decisions being taken by Trump towards Russia, including the end of cyber operations against Russia, and other steps to make the lives of Russian oligarchs easier. It has led both London and Paris to conclude it is now very unlikely the US will provide a military backstop.Starmer and Europe then have to decide if they have the resources to help save Ukraine without US help. Much of what the EU will discuss at its summit on Thursday will help with Europe’s defence in four year’s time, but what matters is what help can be provided to Ukraine in four months when US supplies and spares run out.The threat to seize Russian state bank assets either now or if Russia breaches the terms of a ceasefire remains one of the few cards Europe can play without Trump, and by offering a ceasefire himself, Zelenskyy has also tried to kill the Trump claim that he wants endless war. But Starmer’s hope that Trump if not reliable was biddable seems to be dying.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeDonald TrumpEuropean UnionanalysisShareReuse this content"

The large car park, formerly full of aid trucks, was empty on Tuesday, except for a few soldiers and the Jordanian visitors.0:50Children from Gaza arrive in Jordan for medical treatment – videoFour Jordanian air force helicopters landed on an apron of asphalt, to fly four children in particularly critical condition to Amman for emergency care. The remaining 25 came out in large ambulances, including buses for their parents, guardians and young siblings.They drove up from the southern tip whereGaza, Israel and Egypt meet, and through the area of kibbutzes and farmland where the war started on 7 October 2023 with a surprise and ferocious assault by Hamas on the rural community, in which Palestinian militants killed 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians.The convoy headed north past lines of Merkava tanks and their troops, who have been ordered to take a heightened state ofreadiness for waras the ceasefire stalled at the end of its first six-week phase.The motorcade climbed up the hills to Jerusalem and then down the steep descent through the occupied West Bank into the Jordan valley, finally skirting its way around a long line of trucks and cars that had built up when the Israeli immigration service workers went on a short strike for part of the morning.By the time the children and their parents arrived in Jordan, the sun had gone down and they were exhausted, the long day encased in the ambulances made more tiring by the Ramadan fast.Ahlam Darwish had brought her 16-month-old boy, Malik, who had been hit in the eye during an Israeli bombardment. They were from the al-Shati camp in northern Gaza, but Malik had been injured after they had been displaced by the war and the family was staying in a tent. Ahlam said a fragment from a tent pole had lodged in his eye and he needed urgent surgery.View image in fullscreenBy the time the children and their parents arrived in Jordan, the sun had gone down and they were exhausted.Photograph: Alaa Al Sukhni/ReutersSurgery is not an option in Gaza, where about 80% of hospitals and clinics have been destroyed, and 1,000 doctors, nurses and other medical workers have been killed.“Nothing was possible in Gaza,” Ahlam said, trying to keep her exhausted, squirming child in her lap. Life had begun to improve gradually over the six weeks of the ceasefire, but Netanyahu’s blockade imposed on Sunday instantly triggered a doubling in the price of flour and sugar, and along with it, the dread of renewed bombing.Seven-year-old Nada was swinging her legs off the back of another ambulance, breathing in the cool night air after a stifling day of driving. She was born with a hole in her heart and her health had been deteriorating steadily in recent months.From a bombsite in Gaza to a Texas hospital: Mazyouna’s journey to safetyRead moreHer mother, who did not give her name, heard last Friday that Nada was on the list of medical evacuees, but from then to the moment the ambulances arrived in Jordan, the trip was uncertain.“Everybody in Gaza just needs to know what their future will be. Whether we will be able to rebuild, and go back to life,” she said.“Nada will get the care she needs here, that would have been impossible in Gaza,” said Tariq al-Hamdan, an emergency room medic from Amman’s King Hussein hospital. The convoy had first set out from Amman at 4am, and had spent long periods of time at the border where the paperwork was scrutinised, but he was still elated that the mission had finally succeeded after a series of postponements and the uncertainty brought by the blockade.“We just wish we could have taken more children,” al-Hamdan said.The Jordanian government’s plan is to evacuate 2,000 of Gaza’s child patients in critical condition, so Tuesday’s operation was only a very small step in that direction. Under the agreement with Israel, the next group of children can only be evacuated once this group has been treated and returned to Gaza. By that time there is no guarantee the war will not have returned.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaJordannewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.On a cold evening in London, two German tourists survey the Theatre Royal Drury Lane. Lina, 19, outlines their master plan to meetTom Hiddleston, starring in Much Ado About Nothing. Tonight: scrutinise the procedure at stage door, where only ticket holders are allowed to wait for a chance to meet the cast. Tomorrow: watch Much Ado then race to join the stage-door queue. As a backup, they’ve bought tickets for the next night, too.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“Be prepared!” Lina declares. Are they hoping for autographs, selfies … acting tips? “Just toseehim. That would be enough. We especially travelled here for this. It’s all worth it. I just worry a little that he hasn’t much time.” She considers the arriving fans. “Wow – that’s a very big line.”One person hugged me hard from behind. I was like: 'Oh, you're literally strangling me'Near the front is Lilly, 22, who saw the first half of the play then opted to join the queue rather than watch the rest. (“I’ll read up on the story afterwards!”) A dozen others in the queue have also not watched the full show tonight. Lilly is rehearsing what to say to Hiddleston and co-starHayley Atwell, who are both returning to theatre after Marvel blockbusters. They’re quite the draw: the theatre fits about 2,000 and most performances have practically sold out. Five minutes after it ends, there are 125 people waiting at stage door.When Atwell emerges, her beaming smile is visible from the other side of the street where those without tickets are asked to stand. Passersby stop to stare; crowds swell. Still no sign of Hiddleston. “He’s probably having a poo,” says someone behind me.You might think the curtain call signals the end of the night for actors but there remains the final act at the stage door, where fans have always lingered. Opposite theTheatreRoyal is the tiny Fortune theatre, where cheers are greeting cast members for musical comedy Operation Mincemeat. I meet Liz, 29, who has seen the show several times and has brought flowers for Madeleine Jackson-Smith, debuting in a new role. She’s waiting “to tell the cast that they did a phenomenal job … that just feels polite!”Meanwhile, here comes Hiddleston, albeit to milder whoops than the Mincemeat cast. Like Atwell, he chats, signs, poses for pics. He must have done at least 100 autographs by the time he leaves to cries of despair from a queue now snaking around the corner. But there are no complaints from Lilly, who is buzzing from her encounter.View image in fullscreen‘On Saturdays, you have to be a bit more cautious’ … Layton Williams.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverThat’s the magic of stage door, where gratitude goes both ways. Layton Williams, currently inTitaniqueat the Criterion, tells me he’ll go out almost every night, “no matter how tired I am”. He thanks fans, some of whom he has known for years, and enjoys hearing what the show means to them. Lucie Jones says she encounters people “whose lives have been changed” by a show and has been “humbled” by terminally ill fans saying thank you on a final trip to the theatre. When Renée Lamb meets fans at stage doors in Liverpool, where she grew up, it is especially evident that “I’m essentially doing their dream – that was me at one point”. When she was younger, Lamb waited for Cynthia Erivo at stage door: “She had so much time – she was so gracious.”Zoe Birkett, currently in the Tina Turner bio-musical at the Aldwych, says she appreciates how fans “make the effort to find the stage door – which can sometimes be right the way around the building, down an alley” and that they wait for her. “After I play Tina, I have a cool down, a shower, take off my wig and makeup, get my food ready. I can take about 20 minutes to come out. Just to see them waiting, come rain or shine, with positive feedback, is wonderful.”But some fans aren’t here to flatter. “People can say rude things,” Williams tells me. “One person would say, ‘Oh we’re loving this but just so you know, we thought that TV show was shit.’ I’m like, how about kiss my arse?” Jones has fielded detailed critiques and requests to “sing this note that way” or “do that line like this”. Lamb says a lot of her friends don’t do stage door any more because it makes them too anxious.Sometimes Jones will come out “and there’ll be nobody there,” she says. “The next night, there’ll be 100 people wanting you to sign their programme and make videos for their nan’s cat.” The security provision is equally unpredictable. When she starred in Waitress: The Musical in theWest End, Jones was assisted by “a wonderful man” who accompanied her to her car or train home. At Les Mis, “there’s always a security guard and they stay until you’re done”. But stars can go from receiving a standing ovation in the spotlight to single-handedly controlling crowds themselves outside. Bear in mind they will be physically and emotionally drained – sometimes having done two shows that day.Stage doors may open out on to busy streets. Birkett enjoys playing Wolverhampton Grand – “love the people, love the theatre” – but it is right in the town centre. “If you’re there on a Saturday, you’ve just got to be a bit more cautious.” Williams says that at some of the more exposed stage doors: “You get drunk people walking by. People push in. I’m like, ‘Can you see this queue? Come on!’ It should never come down to the actor to say these things.” Ultimately, says Birkett, actors “walk out of stage door on to a dark street and hope that people are going to be nice”.View image in fullscreen‘Just to see them waiting is wonderful’ … Zoe Birkett as Tina Turner in Tina.Photograph: Matt CrockettPersonal boundaries are not always respected. “Everybody has a horror story, I’ve been pulled and shoved,” notes Lamb. Williams says: “One person hugged me from behind and pulled in. I’m like, ‘Oh, my Adam’s apple – you’re literally strangling me.’ When I’ve seen that person again, I’m like, ‘Please, stand back.’” The positives outweigh the negatives, he says, “but if you think you’re taking the piss you probably are”. For those who come to see him perform eight times a week? “Don’t think we need to be doing stage door eight times a week … How much time do you need to be around one person? If I’m seeing you more than my mum or my boyfriend, we have issues!”All these actors deeply appreciate their fanbase. Birkett finds that “people want to cuddle me and feel the embrace … I do love that but I will always wear a mask to make sure I don’t catch a cold.” She says it’s often younger fans who seek “some sort of physical connection – they want to go: are you real? … Because you’re so different to being on stage when you walk out of stage door.” On the odd occasion, someone has wanted to touch her hair. “I kind of have to go, ‘No, I don’t want to do that.’”In the US, the term “stage-door Johnny” dates back to at least 1890, referring to men who hang around playhouses, targeting female performers. All actors face the danger of inappropriate behaviour. In2023, Paul Mescal told a fan to “take your hand off my ass”after she groped him at the Almeida when he was in A Streetcar Named Desire. (Mescal recently took his own film of thecelebratory atmosphereat stage door after Streetcar’s last night in the West End.)View image in fullscreenHas greeted terminally ill fans at the stage door … Lucie Jones in Waitress: The Musical.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesThe “fear factor” remains for actors, says Jones. Like “when you get followed to your car or someone will tag you in something on social media and they’re really near your house. That may be a coincidence but you have to live slightly on edge because weareaccessible and we do take the same routes home. Where does the duty of care from the theatre stop?” Lamb was in the West End cast of long-running hit Six, “which is essentially an accessible girl band – people are going to want to be close to that”. On a big show, she says, “people do expect to be able to meet you”.When Williams discovered fake social media accounts made in his name, he asked himself: “Have I seen this person at stage door? It’s scary.” One time, an autograph hunter followed him back to his digs and “put a programme literally under the door. It was like 1am or 2am. I was on tour in Newcastle, all by myself.” He still looks over his shoulder after a show, thinking: “I hope someone’s not followed me.” Unfamiliarity with your surroundings means it can be frightening on tour, says Lamb. Birkett has heard of “young dancers who are walking for bloody miles to their digs” after leaving stage door.“Sometimes this can be reduced to a sort of ‘stars’ issue,” says Paul W Fleming, general secretary of Equity, the performing arts and entertainment trade union. It not only affects celebrities, he says, but also “people who are on the minimum wage” appearing in a musical with a huge following. Some fans, he says, are “treating them as props or characters that aren’t real human beings with lives. They’re working people who are members of a trade union, who have every right to dignity at work.” It is indicative, he suggests, of how society generally views the performing arts as not serious.Many performers choose not to make stage-door appearances. On the opening night ofThe Fear of 13at the Donmar Warehouse, there were signs saying Adrien Brody would not do so. Hannah Essex, co-CEO of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, points out: “Actors, like everyone, need to prioritise their health and wellbeing and may not always be able to stop at the stage door. Understanding this helps create a supportive environment for all.” Essex adds: “Theatres are committed to ensuring a positive experience for both staff and the public by working closely with relevant authorities to manage stage-door interactions effectively.”What practical measures may help? Barriers are common on Broadway but Birkett says that with the influx of A-list stars in the West End they may be seen more here – and they make it “less likely that you’re going to get grabbed” says Lamb. But barriers are “not appropriate in every situation,” says Fleming. “We’re talking about Victorian, Georgian buildings in some cases [with] quite weird back alleys.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m essentially doing what they dream of’ … Renée Lamb (front centre) in Six.Photograph: Josh BirdFleming says the situation at stage doors around the country has been exacerbated by “an asset stripping of the industry, with massive multinational corporations purchasing venues, not having an interest in the industry itself but having an interest in profit and so driving down terms and conditions”.He highlights the problem of performers handling crowds themselves after shows. “You’re not paid an hourly rate for that. But equally: is the security guard on the minimum wage? There’s a great temptation to sort of pit worker against worker. Very often [the security guards] are people who have never watched a theatre production themselves. They are not permanently employed by the theatre. They’re going off and being a nightclub bouncer somewhere else. They’re on a zero-hours contract. Whereas in the past, our members would have been on much more stable contracts and the theatre would have employed a stage-door team – a stage-door keeper [who oversees staff coming in and out, handles deliveries and has other duties] plus someone to do security.”A permanent stage-door team, says Fleming, is more likely to “understand the fans and have a bit of a rapport”. That nuanced understanding might alleviate the dismissive responses when members of the ensemble come out as opposed to the lead actor. “People who work their tails off, but maybe don’t necessarily have a following, will come out of stage door, says Jones, “and they are greeted with: ‘Oh, do you know if so-and-so is coming out?’”As soon as you walk out, there’s going to be cameras – and you might be live on someone’s TikTokJones has also found herself handed photos she is proud of but now deems inappropriate to sign. “I did a Wonderbra campaign when I was about 18. You get the occasional guy come and say: ‘Can you please sign these eight photos of teenage you in underwear?’” Lamb says she has been mistaken for other actors of colour at stage door – another reason some performers might think twice about going out, “especially if you’re doing a job that requires being vulnerable”.Birkett says that you can’t fully switch off until you’ve done stage door. “As soon as you walk out, there’s going to be cameras, you might be live on someone’s TikTok.” As a teenage contestant on Pop Idol, she became used to the paparazzi: “But I think if you’re a new actor, it’s probably traumatic. You don’t sign up for that. You’re signing up to play a role because you love acting.”The stage door is where fandom, fuelled by the razzle-dazzle of theatre and 24/7 social media activity, butts against real people’s prosaic lives. “Ninety-eight per cent of the time fans aren’t trying to overstep or be malicious,” recognises Lamb. But Fleming gives a pertinent account about an actor experiencing bereavement on tour, returning to the show after time off. “They leave the stage door with their headphones in. They don’t want to talk to anybody. This is an actor playing a secondary character, chased down the street by fans concerned to know where they have been for the past three shows.”Better understanding of the fan culture, he said, could have predicted and defused the incident. “Because this particular group of fans are going to be interested, they think they’re your friends. And that’s part of the magic of theatre – creating a world that is so special, that people believe it to be true.” But at the end of the day – or the end of the night, on a fast-emptying street in an unfamiliar town – “our members have a right to feel safe in the real world”.Layton Williams is inTitaniqueat the Criterion theatre.

Because, yes, bees are aspirational signifiers of the good life. And yes, bees make beautiful honey for, say, stirring into a sun tea (that would be tea steeped in California sunshine for approx three to four hours) or drizzling into a “beautiful on the inside” cake (which, as far as I can make out, is a Victoria sponge.) But the Duchess of Sussex, who only started beekeeping a year ago but already has “good vibes for good hives”, also sees them as a reminder to do something that scares you a little bit. Like, say, making a tone-deaf lifestyle show in a $8m (£6.3m) Montecito farmhouse while the US and beyond goes to hell in a handcart. “I’m trying to stay in the calm of it because it’s beautiful to be this connected,” she whispers in a low tone, so as not to spook the bees.The Duchess really loves day drinking and crudites: five key takeaways from With Love, MeghanRead moreOr, indeed, her viewers, who find themselves at the deflating juncture where we can finally judge to our heart’s content the contemporary curio that is With Love, Meghan. Do we really need to though? Gazillions of words, many of them predictably hateful, have already been spewed on what it is actually about, based on the two-minute trailer alone. Is Meghan the ultimate tradwife? A domestic goddess in the wink-wink Nigella vein (if only!)? A fake flaunting her wealth? Is it a cynical money-making exercise (Netflix reportedly paid the Sussexes £78m for their overall deal)? A right-on sister who genuinely cares about diversity? An estranged royal suffering from an incurable case of earnestness? Or, as the New York Times dubbed her, is she “the millennial Martha Stewart of Montecito”?Having watched the whole damn thing, I can confirm that I haven’t got the foggiest. But I do know that the duchess loves lemon zesting. And that she keeps flaxseeds, chia seeds and hemp hearts on her counter so she can dust her kids’ pancakes willy-nilly. And that she’s got impressive knife skills. And refers to herself as “Meg’” on the labels she ties around her mason jars, which are filled with whatever surprising moments she happens to be elevating. And that all those years slumming it as a freelance calligrapher have really paid off – her handwriting is lovely.For those who have been hiding in a bunker for completely understandable reasons, With Love, Meghan sees the Duchess of Sussex cooking, flower arranging, candle making, jarring preserves, scenting towels with lavender, making harvest baskets, blowing balloon arches, arranging fruit into rainbows and sprinkling dried edible flowers on literally everything. Creating “moments” is her jam. Though jam, which usually contains equal parts and sugar and fruit, is very muchnother jam because she feels the traditional recipe ratio detracts from the fruit, so actually she’s all about slightly less sweet preserves.View image in fullscreen‘Good vibes for good hives’ … Branden the beekeeper with Meghan, Duchess of Sussex in With Love, Meghan.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThere’s a lot of useless information like this in my head now that will need to be removed slowly, by applying the same care that Meghan shows when designing a crudité plate. Which, incidentally, she makes every single day for her husband and kids. And that’s why they all love vegetables so much! “We don’t all have a garden like this,” she acknowledges as she goes about the sun-washed enorma-estate with her trug, picking lemons always with the leaves on. “I fully recognise that. I didn’t grow up with a garden like this. But go to a farmers market and you can find something … ”Oh God, it’s toe-curling stuff, but hardly surprising. We all saw Meghan show Oprah her chicken coop. Her lifestyle brand was until very recently, called American Riviera Orchard, which I think was supposed to give off an Alice Waters idyll filmed by Nancy Meyers vibe, but sounded more like the sister takeaway to Chicken Cottage. Anyway, she’snow renamed it As Ever. Frankly, WhatEver would be more on brand. Because what With Love, Meghan vibrates with most is a vacuous, over styled joylessness.Harry, mostly referred to as “my husband”, features briefly at the end of the final episode, Feels Like Home, in which Meghan cooks a celebration brunch with Waters to mark the next chapter of her life. I fear this next chapter may be a hidden extra episode, but it seems to be the (re)launch of As Ever. We do discover that Harry salts everything at the table and, like a real man-prince, loves his bacon and fried chicken. Not exactly top news lines but, as With Love, Meghan fails to teach us, we all have to make and do. Otherwise, the guests are friends such as “email pen pal” Mindy Kaling, who struggles to crack jokes in such a rarefied environment and ends up saying vapid things like “What are you, Tinker Bell?!” when Meghan starts sprinkling dried flowers again. The best, as in the most real, episode is Two Kids from LA, when Meghan invites Los Angeles chef Roy Choi over and they make fried chicken and kimchi, discuss the 1990s racist backlash against MSG and reminisce about their LA childhoods. When all is said and done, there is but one aspect of With Love, Meghan on which we can all agree – her old beagle, Guy, is a real honey.Otherwise, it’s back to sweating the small stuff – sniffing essential oils, putting manuka honey into gift bags, and elevating grocery-store carnations. It’s not the activities themselves that are offensive, nor indeed the credo to glean joy from life’s small moments. I could watch Nigella dress her dining table with tea lights then jump into a black cab headed for the local deli until the cows come home. It’s the lack of humour, irony, self-awareness and apprehension of the reality of this deeply unequal and apocalyptic world that makes With Love, Meghan so unlovable in the end.With Love, Meghan is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMeghan, the Duchess of SussexreviewsShareReuse this content"

At level one, girls are not allowed to look out of the window. They are not allowed to talk to each other or look each other in the eye. “Your microexpressions were controlled,” said Carissa Reyes, who joined the programme soon after it first opened in 2008.Girls climb up the ranks with good behaviour, accruing points and privileges. Girls who reach higher levels are able to wear their own clothes or speak with permission. Eventually they reach level five, and are allowed to leave.All contact with the outside world is monitored by staff, so if a girl attempts to talk to her parents about what it is like inside RCR, she risks being dropped to level one, and having to start the programme again.Cassia Cilento was coming down from meth and ecstasy when she first arrived at RCR, a therapeutic treatment centre for girls with “behaviour problems”, in April 2010. She was 14. Earlier that morning, she’d woken up to two strangers in her childhood bedroom in Olympia, Washington. “We’re going to be taking you to your new school,” they said.Cassia was in her underwear, so the strangers began throwing clothes at her to put on. Her parents were nowhere in sight so, feeling like she had no choice, Cassia got into the car with the strangers.They rode to Seattle–Tacoma international airport, took a flight to Las Vegas, then drove through the desert toArizona, pulling up outside RCR, a refurbished motel and restaurant in Fredonia – a sparsely populated town on red mountainous terrain.View image in fullscreenCassia Cilento: ‘It’s like a prison sentence, but you didn’t commit a crime.’Photograph: Arielle Domb/The Guardian“I just remember feeling dehumanised,” said Cassia, who is now 29. “Anything that makes you an individual is gone.” Cassia was told to take out all her piercings and change into an orange T-shirt, grey sweatpants and flip-flops.“It’s like a prison sentence, but you didn’t commit a crime,” said Cassia.Cassia felt lonely and depleted, but one warm memory stands out from her first day at RCR. It was evening, and staff had gathered a group of girls into a circle for a reflection session. Cassia caught eyes with a girl across the circle, who had dirty blond hair and cool blue eyes. Cassia was immediately attracted to her. “I could just tell that we were on the same vibes with the way that we thought. That was before I’d even talked to her.”The girl’s name was Ashley Ciciliano. Ashley, who was then 15, remembers seeing Cassia for the first time too. “I knew she was very special the second I saw her,” she said. After the session, the girls found out that they’d be sharing a room.That night, Ashley sat down next to Cassia when no one else was around and asked her what had brought her to the centre.Cassia had been sexually abused when she was six years old. “I no longer felt safe in this world,” she said. Aged 12, she began taking hard drugs to disassociate.Cassia said that her parents never actually asked her what was wrong. Talking to Ashley felt different. “I felt safe with her and I didn’t feel safe most of my life.”The following night Ashley and Cassia were lying in their bunk beds, when they heard a loud shattering noise. A girl in their dorm had smashed a mirror with a toilet seat and stabbed herself with the shards of glass.It wasn’t until the following evening that staff formally acknowledged what had happened, Ashley said. She remembers Randy Soderquist, the owner of the facility, calling them into a room and telling them that they weren’t allowed to talk to anyone about what had happened – not to the other girls and not to their parents.The girls were terrified. But as days, then weeks passed and the girl didn’t return to RCR, Cassia’s mind began whirling. It might have taken seriously injuring herself to do it, but the girl had managed to escape the facility. Cassia didn’t know it at the time, but she and Ashley would eventually hatch their own escape plan from RCR.View image in fullscreenAshley Ciciliano promised if Cassia was sent back to RCR, Ashley would do whatever it took to help her escape.Photograph: Arielle Domb/The GuardianAcross the US,between 120,000 and 200,000 young peoplelive in “troubled teen” facilities – a network of therapeutic boarding schools, religious academies, wilderness programmes and rehabilitation centres. The centres pledge to support teenagers experiencing addiction, mental illness and behavioural challenges, but many have been accused of abusive practices and stripping residents of their basic human rights.Martha Carol, a former associate attorney at Justice Law Collaborative, said that while “in all 50 states, it’s illegal to abuse children”, there is no national regulation of these facilities, and the specific laws that govern them differ from state to state. (The firm is representing “survivors of abuse” at RCR but said at this time “no legal action” had been filed against the centre.)In recent years, the “troubled teen industry” has garnered mainstream attention, in part due to the Netflix documentary The Program andParis Hilton’s advocacy. After years of campaigning, the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act was finally passed in December 2024, with a plan to develop national recommendations. While the bill is a “monumental step towards accountability”, Kelly Guagenty, a partner at Justice Law Collaborative, said: “The true success of this bill will depend on how it’s implemented.”Meanwhile, RCR continues to run as it always has. Visit its website today and you’ll see a slow-mo video reel of trickling water fountains and smiling girls playing football and speaking to the camera about their positive experience at the programme. But in interviews with more than 17 former attenders of RCR over the past year, a different atmosphere was described to me. Many former residents are demanding accountability and reform within RCR and the “troubled teen industry” as a whole. This is the first time many of them are making these allegations publicly, beyond sharing videos onsocial media.RCR was set up by husband and wife Randy and Toni Soderquist, who – according to their website – were inspired to set up the facility after helping one of their daughters through an abusive relationship.Former residents said their stays at RCR cost tens of thousands of dollars, but they received inadequate therapy and were made to do manual labour. Carissa said that when she arrived at RCR, girls were forced to renovate the facility, building a walkway and spending “at least six hours every day for a week” pulling out weeds in 100F (38C) heat. She said that girls were made to work without compensation at the neighbouring restaurant.When asked about the allegations in this article, Randy Soderquist said that “due to medical privacy regulations” he was “unable to discuss specific treatment methods or even to confirm or deny that any of the people … interviewed were actually students in our care”. However, he emphasised that “as an organisation we have always been deeply committed to the wellbeing and safety of our residents” and that “our core values of care, respect and dedication to each student’s growth and success have remained unwavering.”But most of the former residents I spoke with didn’t feel their wellbeing was prioritised. “We were herded around like a bunch of sheep,” said Sophie Olsen, who was released from RCR in February 2023 after a 17-month stay. “If we had to use the bathroom, they could just ignore our hand for as long as they wanted,” she said. “It’s just complete denial of any sort of humanity.”Girls also described being subject to violent “restraints” for minor wrongdoings, such as refusing to put on their socks. Ashley remembers a triple amputee who used to be “physically restrained as a means of convenience” until she began “wailing”. Yet staff neglected her hygiene needs, meaning that the girl’s roommates had to change her soiled underwear. “Staff didn’t want to deal with it,” Ashley said.Soderquist’s five children (and later, their spouses) worked at RCR, even though some were younger than the boarders themselves. “Sometimes Randy would leave us alone and we would have to ask his 10-year-old daughter Emily permission to talk,” said Delaney Migues, who attended RCR in 2008.View image in fullscreenDelaney Migues in November. ‘I have no doubt my trust issues come from this.’Photograph: Arielle Domb/The GuardianGirls described having to take part in humiliating, “bogus” therapeutic practices, like having to wear a “busty red dress” and re-enact The Lady in Red (the well-known Chris de Burgh song about a seductive woman dressed in red) or stand in a group banging a towel on the ground and saying the word “mommy”.Siobhan Kelly Fogarty, now 32, who boarded at RCR from July 2009 to April 2010, remembers once having to lie on the floor wrapped in a sheet for eight hours, imitating a cocoon, until she broke down crying. She said it seemed as though the point of these workshops was “to make you the most vulnerable and weak you could be so that they can build you back up and say: ‘See, the programme is here for you.’”Girls describe their bodies going into overdrive from stress at RCR. One former resident said that she didn’t get her period for the entire eight months she was there.Girls said they couldn’t speak their mind during therapy sessions, as whatever they said could be used against them, resulting in them staying longer. “It’s a complete conflict of interest,” said Delaney. “Do you really think I’m going to be honest with my therapist, when you can decide if I go home or not?”While almost everyone I spoke with described being negatively affected by RCR, one 18-year-old woman, who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, told me that she loved her therapist at RCR and that he “helped me and my family more than words can describe”. The woman, who attended RCR last year, more than a decade after many of the other women I spoke with, said that staff would “try everything” they could before using a physical restraint. “It’s treatment,” she said. “It’s not supposed to be fun. It’s not summer camp.”For many former residents, however, one of the worst things about the programme was feeling like you couldn’t trust anyone – creating an environment where residents were incentivised to snitch on one another and were punished for not reporting rule-breaking. “To this day, I have no doubt my trust issues come from this,” said Delaney, who has since been diagnosed with PTSD.Still, girls found ways to connect with one another. During music therapy, when the teacher was playing the piano, facing away from the class, Ashley and Cassia would look at each other and giggle. Or on outings, they would sit next to each other on the coach back. Slowly, they got to know each other. “She was the only person that I could trust,” Cassia recalled. “The only person that I thought really saw what was going on with me.”By fall, it was clear that the girls had feelings for one another. They still hadn’t kissed, but sometimes, when they hugged, they’d hold each other for a little longer. In October 2010, Ashley was released from RCR. Cassia was released a few months later, but spent the next few months yo-yoing between home and RCR. Any time she tried to talk to her parents about RCR, she felt like they didn’t listen: “They were totally convinced that it was better for me to be there.”Eventually, at the end of 2011, Cassia moved back home to Washington, where Ashley was also living. The girls began hanging out more regularly and their relationship became official. But, a few months later, after Cassia’s mother walked in on her and Ashley sharing a bed, Cassia feared she would be sent back to RCR. She suspected that her parents had spoken with Soderquist, who her dad highly respected, “so much so that I even thought my dad was in love with him, because he put him on a pedestal like he was his God”.So Ashley made Cassia a promise. If Cassia was sent back to RCR, Ashley would do whatever it took to help her escape.Not long after, Cassia’s brother asked her if she wanted to meet up at a local mall. Ashley was suspicious that it was going to be a set-up, but agreed to drive over, waiting in the car while Cassia met him inside. Moments later, Ashley looked out the window to see Cassia being dragged by a man towards an SUV.Ashley jumped out of the car. “What’s going on?” she said. “Why are you taking her?” She got back into her car, started following the vehicle, but lost sight of it after a few traffic lights. Ashley drove to the airport, purchasing a plane ticket to get past security, then checked the gate of every flight to Las Vegas.Little did she know that Cassia’s abductors were taking her on a different route, having probably anticipated that Ashley would follow her. She was at a different gate, awaiting a flight to Salt Lake City.‘I had no idea what I was going in for, but I knew it’d be better than the hell I was living in’Back at RCR, Cassia cried for two days straight. Being back at the facility felt like jail, but worse, “because with jail, you have a set date you can get out”.A new dynamic had evolved that was making Cassia feel uncomfortable. A female staff member in her 30s called Helen (not her real name) had begun paying extra attention to her – letting Cassia off chores, doing her little favours, even rubbing her feet during a movie. Helen told Cassia that she was also gay.“I loved it at first,” Cassia said. “Until it started to get weird.” Cassia found Helen’s behaviour triggering. “It was very conflicting internally,” she said, reflecting on the trauma of being groomed and sexually abused as a child. “I knew what it could lead to because of what had happened to me.”Numerous former residents describe sexually inappropriate behavior between staff and residents of RCR, such as “footsie” under the table or one staffer writing his number in a girl’s Bible.Helen’s behaviour towards Cassia had the added layer of hypocrisy, given RCR’s anti-LGBTQ+ stance. “The people that were gay or bi or whatever were very afraid to express that,” said Siobhan. If girls were found to be in an “inappropriate” relationship, she said, “it would be very harshly punished, straight back to level one.” Some former residents describe being pressured to misgender a trans attender, having to write a 1,000-word essay if they called him by his correct pronouns.View image in fullscreenThe protest outside RCR in Fredonia, Arizona, on 12 November 2024.Photograph: Arielle Domb/The GuardianHelen’s advances towards Cassia eventually abated when another girl reported it to a staff member. Cassia said she received the blame: she had points deducted and had to write a 1,000-word essay. “I think their exact words were that I shouldn’t have accepted the favours.”Meanwhile, in Washington, Ashley was desperately trying to get in contact with Cassia. She had worked out the password to her online study portal and was posting cryptic notes on the discussion board, hoping to get Cassia’s attention without alarming staff. For a while, Cassia didn’t seem to register her messages, so Ashley typed out something more explicit: she was coming to RCR to help Cassia escape.Not long after, in April 2012, Soderquist told Cassia that he had intercepted their messages. Cassia remembered him telling her that it was an unhealthy relationship and that if Ashley set foot on the property, they would have “rights to shoot her”. Ashley said Soderquist left her a voicemail relaying a similar message. She needed a new plan.Ashley began scouring Facebook and saw that RCR had a swim team. Her mind started racing. Cassia was a big swimmer. Ashley looked up swim meet schedules near Fredonia and her eyes narrowed in on an upcoming competition in St George, Utah. It was a gamble, but Ashley felt like she was on to something. “I was willing to bet that Cassia could find a way to convince them to let her go.”In June 2012, Ashley and her friend Cindy (not her real name) drove for 15 hours from Washington to the recreational centre in St George. “Even recounting it now, my adrenaline’s through the roof,” said Ashley. They arrived in the early hours of the morning, carrying burner phones with wire headsets. Ashley sat in the car, titling her Yankees hat over her face so she wouldn’t be recognised, her heart pounding, and sent Cindy inside to look for Cassia. Inside the changing room, Cindy caught Cassia’s eye.“Are you ready to go?” Cindy said.“I didn’t even think about it,” Cassia remembers. “I had no idea what I was going to be in for, but I knew it was going to be better than the hell that I was living in.”Cassia followed Cindy out the back entrance of the changing room but another RCR girl started following her, asking where she was going. Cassia shouted at her: “Go back! What are you doing? You’re not staff. You don’t need to follow me.”The girl turned around and Cassia bolted towards the car park. Ashley was there, sitting behind the steering wheel of her Mazda SUV. Cindy bundled into the passenger seat and Cassia followed, squishing her body next to Cindy’s feet.Ashley hit the gas.“Oh my God, Cassia, are you OK?!” said Ashley, hitting the road towards Las Vegas, throwing her sim card out the window, worried she might be tracked. Cassia, wedged beneath Cindy’s feet, could barely see out the window – just glimpses of red desert, blending into grey freeways dotted with cars. She told Ashley that she almost hadn’t been allowed to go to the swim meet; Soderquist had been worried she would use it as an opportunity to run away.When they hit Mesquite, 40 miles from the swimming pool, the girls began to relax. Ashley had brought Cassia her Ed Hardy perfume, her Juicy Couture bag and her stuffed toy, a skunk called Alex. “Those things just made me feel so cared for,” Cassia said.Ashley asked Cassia what she wanted to eat. It was still morning, but Cassia, who had spent so much time at RCR dreaming about food, wanted cheesecake. They drove to Monte Carlo casino on the Las Vegas Strip, where the girls sat in a booth, surrounded by middle-aged gamblers smoking in front of slot machines. Cassia ordered a cheesecake with Graham cracker crust, topped with strawberries and a dollop of vanilla bean ice-cream.The girls spent the next few weeks on the road. They drove to Venice Beach and filled up their car with art – dream catchers, a painting of a little pink house on the beach – unloading it into their Motel 6 hotel room as if it was their own apartment. “Every moment was enriching,” says Cassia. “I was experiencing life in a way that I had never been able to do before.” Still, the dread of being caught and returned to RCR was on both their minds.At the beginning, the girls would drive around blasting EDM, until they ran out of money and Ashley sold her car sound system to a man from Craigslist (the girls subsequently joined him at an underground rave in a sewage tunnel).In San Francisco, Ashley and Cassia went to their first Pride event, ending up at a block party. Cops turned on fire hoses, but people continued dancing in the water, grooving in the glittering spray until the early hours. “It was very empowering, going from being deprived of anything” to a world that was suddenly “full of rich, colorful, diverse life”, Ashley said.But money was tight. A couple of weeks into their time on the road, Cindy decided she couldn’t do it any more. She went back home, leaving Ashley and Cassia alone. The girls would ask for money at gas stations, explaining that they had got lost on a school trip in California and wanted to get back to Washington. Sometimes kind strangers would fill up their tank. They slept in car parks or on the beach, buying a loaf of bread and a can of beans to sustain them for the week.View image in fullscreenPhotos from Cassia and Ashley’s time on the road.Going back was never an option. “I would rather have died in that car than go back to the programme,” Cassia said. Still, the nights were scary. “Every time I fell asleep, I’d wake up because I was terrified somebody was going to come to our door,” Cassia said.Then, one morning, in mid-July, they did. Ashley and Cassia were staying at a Motel 6 in Bellflower, a city near Los Angeles. The day before, the girls had bought a four-week-old chihuahua-dachshund mix from Craigslist for $20. They named her Cookie Taco. “It was like we were starting our own home,” said Cassia. “I wanted to get a job. I wanted to have an apartment, I wanted to raise my dog. I just wanted those basic things.”The next day, the girls had planned to wake up early to go to the beach for sunrise. But they ended up sleeping in. At about 9am, they heard a knock on the door. Cassia felt sick. She started crying and shaking.“I just wanted to be free,” she said.The girls looked through the peephole and saw a man standing on the other side of the door. It was a staffer from RCR, who had come to take Cassia back. A few days earlier, Ashley had contacted a family member to ask her to book the motel room (Ashley would learn later that she called another family member,who called Cassia’s parents, who then arranged for the staffer to pick her up).“I was ripped away from that puppy,” Cassia said. “That was one of the hardest things I ever had to go through.”Driving back to RCR, Cassia said the staffer put his arm around her. “He was saying things like: ‘You’re really pretty.’” Cassia didn’t fight back. “Because of the trauma I’ve been through,” she said, her instinct “was just to take it and not argue, so it doesn’t get worse”.Back at RCR, Cassia’s world felt darker than ever. She said that she was made to sleep in the classroom with the lights on so she could be watched at all times, and kept “on silence” for about two and a half months, which meant she wasn’t allowed to speak to anyone, except for Soderquist. She wasn’t allowed to journal. “I felt like I didn’t exist,” she said.View image in fullscreen‘It was like we were starting our own home,’ Cassia said of their time on the road.Unable to communicate verbally, Cassia needed to find a way to stimulate her mind to hold on to reality. She began counting things. She would count the number of rooms in the building. The number of chairs. The number of brunettes. “A lot of it was survival mode,” she reflects. “Unfortunately, that is the trauma that stuck with me into adulthood. I’ve been on survival mode since I left.”A few weeks after arriving back at RCR, Cassia said, Soderquist decided to do an exercise with her. She remembers him asking her to write Ashley a letter, “basically saying that I didn’t care about her, I didn’t love her, I didn’t want her in my life”. Cassia complied, not knowing at the time that the letter was going to be sent to Ashley.At home in Washington, Ashley opened it up. “Dear Ashley,” the letter began. “I’m sorry that it has to be this way, but I’m done. I can’t do this anymore.”Ashley’s first thought was that Cassia had been forced to write it, but then she began doubting herself. “I started to get concerned, maybe they are shifting her opinion on things,” she said. “Maybe she really doesn’t want anything to do with me.”But as she continued reading, Ashley noticed a shift in tone. “I just pray to God that it isn’t the end forever,” Cassia wrote. “Never forget me, for you will never leave my heart.” The letter felt like it was brimming with secret signs and signatures – “Cassisms”, Ashley called them. Still, she couldn’t be sure. “You start to feel paranoid,” she said. “You’re like: ‘Am I reading into this too much?’”Cassia said she spent months back at RCR before Soderquist allowed her to take a home visit, a few days before Christmas 2012. Back at home, Cassia said she begged her parents not to make her go back. “They never gave me a chance to see if I was going to get better.“I wanted to do it right,” she said. “I wanted to live the normal life. But my dad told me: ‘No, you’re going to stay there until you’re 18.’”Cassia got in contact with Ashley. “Are you ready to do this again?” she said. Ashley drove to Cassia’s parents house on Christmas Eve. Her house had a big driveway and Ashley parked outside it, at the bottom of a hill. Cassia walked down and got inside the car. The initial plan was to wait until after Christmas to run away, but the longer Cassia sat in the car, the more she felt they had to leave there and then. She didn’t even go back into the house to get her bags. They drove away that night.They got married on Valentine’s Day in 2014, 10 days after Cassia turned 18.‘The spark in my eyes left’View image in fullscreenPeople protest outside RCR in Fredonia, Arizona, on 12 November 2024.Photograph: Arielle Domb/The GuardianA few months ago, on 12 November, Ashley did something she never thought she’d do. Twelve years after she helped Cassia escape the programme for the first time, she drove from Las Vegas to Fredonia, back to RCR.It was afternoon, and a dozen survivors had traveled from across the country to protest outside the facility. The group held up signs that read “people over profit” and “RCR gave me PTSD”, chanting and livestreaming testimonies by the roadside until the sky turned purple and pink.“I came with the hope of getting help,” Ariana Morales, a former resident, said into a shiny megaphone. “The spark in my eyes left and became a part of Arizona’s sparkly, starry night sky.”Ashley said: “When I got out of this facility in 2010 there was not a forum for us to speak. The world did not understand what we were trying to communicate.”In response to the allegations in this article, Soderquist said that RCR had been “licensed by the state of Arizona for the past 15 years”. He said: “Each year we have met and exceeded their rules, regulations and standards of care and conduct.” He added that the facility had “received accreditation from CARF International, an independent, non-profit accreditor of health and human services organisations and received a three-year accreditation”.Cassia’s father refused to be interviewed for this story unless Soderquist approved him doing so. When I spoke to Cassia’s mother, Andréa, she told me how hard it was seeing Cassia using drugs as a teenager. “She was dying right in front of us,” she said. Having spent hours talking to Cassia about what she described as horrific experiences at RCR, it was jarring to hear the gulf between her recounting and Andréa’s very different version of events. “It’s an awesome place. It was the best place to send Cassia and Randy is fabulous,” Andréa told me over the phone. “He really was in touch with the girls,” she said. “You could tell how much they respected him.”View image in fullscreenAshley Ciciliano at the protest outside RCR.Photograph: Arielle Domb/The GuardianThe law firm Justice Law Collaborative has since released a statement, which states: “RCR needs to be held accountable for the harm and injuries they have caused our clients and other students.” Martha Carol, the formerassociate attorney, said that when residential centres were shut down after allegations of abuse, it was common for owners to simply open up a new facility under a different name afterwards. “There needs to be a lot more community-based support so that kids can get help when they’re at home,” she said.In September 2023, Ashley and Cassia got divorced. They remain on good terms. This year, Ashley hopes to go to law school and Cassia will do a master’s in psychology. Both cite their experience at RCR as a motivating factor in their careers, galvanizing them to help adolescents who may face similar issues that they did.In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visit their website for more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

ForEmma Raducanu, this means that after one of the most difficult experiences of her career, another encounter with a stalker, she has had little time to digest her emotions before the next big event is upon her.Last month, while she competed in a series of tournaments across Asia, Raducanu was pursued by a stalker across tournament sites, cities and borders, who attempted strategically to approach her when she was alone. His behaviour culminated in Raducanu spotting him in the stands during her second‑round match against Karolina Muchova in Dubai. Understandably emotional, Raducanu asked for the man to be removed. He was subsequently banned from WTA tournaments andsigned an agreement to stay away from her.Andy Murray to coach Novak Djokovic at Indian Wells and Miami OpenRead moreIt was not entirely clear when Raducanu would return. While the stalker in question has seemingly been handled, this is the second time in three years that the 22‑year‑old has had to take public measures to protect herself from invasive, obsessive behaviour.Her first encounter with such an individual culminated in Amrit Magarbeing handed a five‑year restraining orderand community service for stalking Raducanu, visiting her family home and stealing items from its front porch in 2021. Her comments during the court case underlined the lasting impact such behaviour has. “Because of this I feel like my freedom has been taken away from me,” she said. “I am constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel on edge and worried this could happen again.”It would have been completely understandable if she decided she needed more time to parse her emotions, that she was not ready to return to the grind of the tour, which includes many interactions with spectators and where the players are always on show. She hasshown her resilienceby opting to return to competition as soon as possible.Raducanu will play this week at Indian Wells, a mixed WTA/ATP Masters 1000 event and the biggest tournament since the Australian Open in January. Perhaps a reflection of the additional focus on Raducanu after the stalking incident, she practised with the tournament director, Tommy Haas, on Friday during one of her first days in California. Indian Wells is said to have also bolstered its security in light of the events in Dubai.Raducanu was dealt a difficult hand in the draw. She will face Moyuka Uchijima of Japan in the first round, a player who, at No 52 in the WTA rankings, sits three places above the Briton. A second‑round tussle with Coco Gauff, who received a first-round bye as a third seed, awaits the winner in round two. Regardless of Gauff’s recent indifferent form, this remains a tough slice of luck.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu during practice at Indian Wells.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesOn the court, this has been a challenging period for Raducanu. Despite her off-season being ravaged by back spasms that badly affected her preparations for the new season, she had started her year well in Australia with a solid run to the third round beforebeing dismantled by Iga Swiatek, the world No 2. However, Raducanu’s coach, Nick Cavaday, subsequently opted to leave the team due to his own medical issues.After Raducanu’s well‑publicised difficulties with finding a long‑term coach she appeared to have established a measure of stability with Cavaday, a childhood coach she knew well and with whom she had a great rapport, since reuniting at the end of 2023. His departure was clearly a significant setback.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She will be coached in Indian Wells by Tom Welsh, an LTA academy coach, who is also helping on an interim basis.Raducanu’s difficult 1-4 record in February initially seemed to reflect the uncertainty in her coaching team but the stalking incidents and the distress it evidently caused for an extended period of time clearly put a different complexion on her results.Raducanu’s match with Muchova ended with the Czech, one of the best players in the world right now, narrowly winning 7-6 (6), 6-4. Raducanu managed to show her quality by competing at an admirably high level until the end. She will step back on to the court in California aiming to again play quality tennis and set up a high-profile match with another one of the best in the world. For once, though, the results and her performances do not seem to be of particular importance.It is more relevant that she is back competing, travelling and the actions of certain unhinged individuals have not stopped her from doing what she wants to do.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We meet the new breed of music overseers whose anachronistic soundtracks are taking TV to thrilling new heightsMichael HannTue 4 Mar 2025 10.45 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 10.47 ESTShareThere was a time, 20 or so years ago, when it seemed as if TV music supervisors were among the most important people when it came to shaping public tastes. There were, as yet, no video or music streaming services, so music featured in a hit show could blow up as a result. One music supervisor – Alexandra Patsavas, whose work included selecting tunes for Grey’s Anatomy – became so influential that Lena Dunham’s Girls featured a storyline in which two characters dreamed of having their lives changed by getting a song approved by her on Grey’s Anatomy, most likely a wispy piece of indie electronica over which a doctor would gaze wistfully into the middle distance while another patient copped it.While music supervisors may no longer have Patsavas’s power to create new stars through a perfect piece of placement, the work of music supervisors these days is more imaginative than it has ever been, and it can be highlighted in ways it never was before: think how many times you’ve Shazamed something while sitting in front of the TV, or checked Spotify to see if there’s a playlist of the soundtrack. And often, they’re brilliant: try the perfectly judged dad rock of The Bear, or the incredible assemblage of early 1980s Black American music in the crack epidemic drama Snowfall. It helps, too, that a strong needle drop – the moment a featured song begins playing – can be a great promotional tool on social media.Amelia Hartley, who has worked in music supervision for more than 20 years and whose credits include the startlingly exciting soundtracks toPeaky Blindersand SAS Rogue Heroes, credits the rise of prestige TV with opening up the spectrum of soundtracks. “HBO and other big producers started to do big drama series that used anachronistic music in incredibly creative ways,” she says, highlighting the launch of Boardwalk Empire in 2010. “From then on, people moved away from the idea of drama being a score-led thing, in a Jane Austen-type way, and into soundtracking with really cool commercial music, lifting the drama to another level. And when the streamers came on board, they really embraced that.”View image in fullscreenPerfect with a bit of Nick Cave … Peaky Blinders.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn MandabachEd Bailie, who supervised the music for Netflix’s reboot ofTop Boy, points out the effect very dramatic use of music can have on people’s perception of the whole soundtrack. “People know Top Boy is an east London drama, so that leads us to grime, trap, UK hip-hop and drill. But we’ve got cues in there from Wreckless Eric, and we’ve got reggae. It’s a far broader musical palette.”OK, but no one who watches Top Boy is coming away from it thinking about Wreckless Eric, just as no one who watches SAS Rogue Heroes is thinking about Vera Lynn. They’re remembering gunfire and booming hard rock. Bailie laughs. “That’s true.”Rogue Heroes has been peppered with startling “needle drop” moments, where the soundtrack and action marry perfectly. In season one, a parachute mission is backed by the slow-burn intensity of AC/DC’s Live Wire, while German defences in Crete are stormed to the sound of Motörhead’s Overkill. More recently, in season two, a jeep raid in occupied Italy is soundtracked by Deep Purple’s road warrior anthem Highway Star. Each time, the music ratchets up the excitement, but also produces an uncomfortable sensation: should brutal, unforgiving warfare be this exciting? And for those thinking it all sounds a bit metal, The Fall, Bauhaus, MC5 and more are also used to great effect.For both Peaky Blinders and SAS Rogue Heroes, Hartley focused on anachronistic music: the former, set a century ago, used dark and brooding singer-songwriters, such as Nick Cave andPJ Harvey. The latter, set in the second world war and based on Ben Macintyre’s nonfiction bestseller, goes hard on – for want of a better word – thug rock: boomingly aggressive 70s and 80s hard rock and punk, with some interesting and telling digressions.Season two director Stephen Woolfenden gives an example: “There’s a wonderful reveal of [SAS founder] David Stirling at the end of episode one with The Teams That Meet in Caffs by Dexys Midnight Runners – and that’s a beautiful moment.” He’s right: the notion of early Dexys, a band of ragtag ruffians bent on their own direction, soundtracking another bunch of young men with the same purpose is perfect on many levels.Even within the hard rock sphere, Hartley was able to find less raucous moments. “One I like is She Sells Sanctuary by the Cult at the end of episode four. It’s an emotional episode, and I like the way the guitar comes in at the end and lifts you out of the episode.’Both Peaky Blinders and SAS Rogue Heroes were written by Steven Knight, who had very clear ideas himself about what he wanted, reflecting the fact that music supervisors are adamant that they are there to work with writer, director and editor, not to foist their choices on them.View image in fullscreenEd Bailie … John Lewis Christmas ads.Photograph: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images“When I’m writing,” says Knight, “I’m imagining what’s happening on screen in total. So that means imagining the movement of the actors, the words that are being said, but also the soundtrack. I found the soundtrack is a very mysterious thing that most people don’t question. We watch something, and we hear music, and we never ask, ‘Where’s that music coming from?’ So you take advantage of the fact that there is an extra suspension of disbelief when it comes to music.” So the door is open to anachronistic music.But, says Knight, modern alternative music is not just there to display the exquisite taste and outstanding knowledge of the production team. It’s because the music that might have emotionally affected the characters at that point in history would simply seem laughable to modern audiences. “So it felt like pulling away a barrier to have the music work directly on the emotions of the audience. And what I think people forget is that most of the people in the SAS at the time were in their late teens or early 20s. The music needed to reflect the explosive emotions of people at that age.”So far, we’ve been talking about “non-diegetic” music – songs that only the audience hear. On most shows, there is a clear division between non-diegetic and diegetic (what the characters also hear), but on Top Boy it could often feel as though the dividing lines were blurred. For the show, Bailie had to look not just for old music, but for new tracks and even unreleased tracks. Although he scoffs at the notion of music supervisors acting almost as A&R consultants (music industry talent-spotters) that was a decent chunk of his job on Top Boy.View image in fullscreen‘Being on the cultural pulse was really important’ … Kane Robinson in Top Boy.Photograph: Chris Harris/Netflix“One aspect of the A&R thing that’s always tricky is production turnaround. By the time we’ve picked the song, mixed it, mastered it, then waited the many months before the show is finally released, the track will likely be out, unless you can get them to hold it back. We are so beholden to our benefactors who help point us towards great music – the A&R people, the managers, the sync agents, the people in record stores. And for Top Boy that was a really deep dive, because being on the cultural pulse was really important.”What music supervisors don’t want is to create new cliches, or to select something too on the nose. “I’ve ruined any pleasure I might get from watching TV drama,” says Hartley, “because all I do is watch it and think about the music.” Bailie, though, did create a TV music cliche, as one of the music team behind the John Lewis Christmas ads. “It morphed and manifested into ukulele songs with slightly annoying, cutesy voices behind them. And that wasn’t what we were doing, but that’s how other people emulated it. But you always want to build your own thing.”Maybe SAS Rogue Heroes will create a new cliche of AC/DC, the Saints and the Stooges becoming the soundtrack to the second world war. If so, you know who to blame.Explore more on these topicsMusicTelevisionPeaky BlindersTop BoyMotorheadAC/DCPJ HarveyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Rules have changed over the course of my life, but there are always Rules.In the early days of theCovidlockdown – already anxious enough about my parents being trapped in India, my inability to return home to Canada and the government building a hospital in Central Parkjust in case– I was still counting my 1,200 daily calories, refusing myself bread and rice, sneaking a cookie and then thinking about it for the rest of the day.I couldn’t stop myself: I’d wander out of my house after days of being stuck inside, buy a coffee and a croissant with the anxiety of someone being hunted for sport and then weigh myself after I devoured its crumbs, surprised that I could gain a few pounds during the day. I felt like I would surely die before the end of the year, along with everyone else I had ever known, our lungs collapsing from Covid-19, but first, it was very important that I feel bad about carbohydrates.I’m 34 now, hopefully beyond my years of dietary self-flagellation. But in my late 20s, I had fantasies about how my eating disorder would eventually serve me. Maybe I’d get run down with some illness that sapped my appetite and I’d lose weight that way. Maybe I’d become bedridden and incapable of consuming more than clear broths and blanched carrots. Or,ooooh, maybe I’d get a tapeworm, and the tapeworm would eat all my food, and then I would become thin and have a gross but fascinating story to tell at dinner parties (where I would never eat much, of course).Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’While we all huddled indoors for what ended up being nearly two very surreal years, I thought about how I could emerge from my personal pandemic a little bit better, a little bit more beautiful, a little bit more desirable.Maybe if I worked out really hard and made healthy lunches and cut down on my after-work drinking, I’d emerge skinnier than I’d ever been in my life. This was my time to pupate, if only I could stop the stress of the pandemic from making the rest of my body rebel against me. My eyes started twitching, my muscles ached every day, my teeth chipped, my nails peeled, and my hair fell out. But was I getting thinner? That’s all that mattered.I hadn’t made myself purge since I was in my early 20s, but now I had all the time in the world to inspect myself, to criticize every morsel I let enter my body, to work out a way to make sure it would be a demon exorcised before the next mealtime came around.I have yet to meet another woman who doesn’t eventually admit to having the same insecurities, the same anxieties about their size and shape, how much space they take up in a room, how they feel if a chair creaks under them. I’m mad at myself for being mad at myself, mostly because it’s such a jejune affliction to have. Couldn’t I instead have one of the more interesting entries of the DSM-5? A compulsion to eat dishwasher pods like the women of My Strange Addiction? Or maybe they could name a brand new disorder after me. I’m open to suggestions.There’s something despicable about the conspiratorial way women talk to each other about food. “Should we get dessert?” we ask each other, looking coy, as if we’re asking if we should both do heroin in the streets. “Oh, let’s be bad!” we might say when ordering queso. “We’ve earned it!” is another one, as if food is something you’re allowed to have only if you put in the requisite work beforehand. It’s a language I fell into naturally, imprinted from the start.View image in fullscreen‘I have yet to meet another woman who doesn’t eventually admit to having the same insecurities, the same anxieties about their size and shape … ’Composite: The Guardian/Scaachi KoulIt’s rote for a woman to blame her issues with food on her mother, but cliches exist for a reason. One Saturday, when I was 12 and my mother didn’t yet trust me enough to leave me home alone for an afternoon, she took me to her Tops Club meeting. Tops stood for “Take Off Pounds Sensibly,” a support group originally founded in 1948 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There was a diet plan, but there was also a focus on not letting idle hands be the devil’s workshop – my mother started doing childish arts and crafts as an attempt to avoid snacking after dinner. I used to admire this rainbow she fashioned with a plastic frame and multicolored ribbons, little plastic beads hanging from the ends, which I was told decidedly wasnota toy.For a year, my mom attended weekly meetings at the Cedarbrae Community Center, where she’d sit in a circle with other middle-aged women to talk about her week. “This week, Iturtled,” she said, which I later found out meant she had neither lost nor gained, a victory unto itself. The women clapped modestly. I went to that meeting at a time of my childhood where I knew inherently my weight was a “problem” for a lot of people, but I didn’t yet feel like it was a problem for me. I was uncomfortable with my body but only because everyone around me kept reacting to how much it was changing. As soon as I had a handle on it, a new cup size would pop up, a new dimple of cellulite, a new inch of soft flesh around my midsection.My mother dragged herself through every diet conceivable. She did Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig (she contests the latter but the guidebooks that littered our home tell a different story). She went low carb and high fat. She increased her protein and then cut down her sugars. One particularly restrictive meal plan left her so nutrient deficient she had to go to the doctor for weekly shots to make sure she didn’t succumb to scurvy. I hated that diet the most: her moodiness became sharp and sudden. At my brother’s wedding, she ate so little, trying to winnow herself down to a smaller size, that she fainted during one of the ceremonies. No one stopped the events; they just fanned her and offered her orange juice until she came back to the surface.“You know how your mom is,” one of my cousins told me, as if self-torture is more acceptable if it is routine. I was at my thinnest at that wedding; I knew, because my mom told me I was. She was proud. I was hungry.Growing older means finding out you’re fucking things up in brand new ways. When I was 16, I was a failure because I thought I was fat. In my late 20s, I became a failure because I thought I was fat and because I knew better than to think being fat was a problem in the first place.I read books by women with active eating disorders and ones by women who claimed to be long healed. I read books by fat-positive nutritionists and body-neutrality activists. I read about real fatphobia – how it prevents fat people from getting work or boarding an airplane with a modicum of dignity – and about how mid-sized and thin women perpetrate a war against all our bodies through our anxiety about becoming fat ourselves. I read about disability and health and diabetes and heart disease and the racist history of the body mass index.It is much easier to hate your body when you refuse to see it within a continuum of oppression. For so long, hating our bodies was viewed as a private, necessary act of self-loathing. It was important to keep ourselves in check, as if inwardly directed contempt could protect you from weight gain. But if you view fatphobia as a larger societal failure – like anti-Blackness or littering or literally anything that happens in an American post office – then it behooves you to adjust your thinking. You are no longer ruining your own life, you’re ruining someone else’s. Your ideology is contagious. Self-loathing is transmissible through the air. We can’t truly hate our bodies without hating anyone in a body larger than ours. The older I get – and the older my mother gets – the less interested I am in causing harm through my own low self-esteem.Any attempt to lose weight purely for aesthetic reasons is, ultimately, fatphobia weaponized. Just because you point a gun to your own head doesn’t make it less of a gun; it doesn’t mean someone else can’t pick it up and then use it on themselves. You have to accept that you’re not uglier than anyone, but you’re not more beautiful. That your body isn’t just something to be admired – though it can be, if you want – but a tool that lifts, moves, twists, breaks, folds and dies. It requires the radical act of no longer comparing yourself to your friends, the radical act of loving yourself so you can love everyone who doesn’t look like you, too. It means you have to think beyond your own pain and the cruelty you learned to dig at yourself with.My mom’s attitude about weight and diet has changed drastically in the last decade. When I texted her about Tops recently, she didn’t dwell on the year she spent picking at herself in her meetings and instead asked: “What’s the name of that frozen treat at Dairy Queen?”“A Blizzard?” I said. “Why? Do you want one?”“Yes,” she said, in the way that I remember my mom talking about sugar: conspiratorial and giddy. “Badly.”I’ve been losing the fight with my own body for a deceptively simple reason: I treat it as a fight in the first place. My body has either been something to fight, like an unruly animal needing discipline, or something to shirk from. But what if instead of fight or flight, I treated my body like someone I trusted? What else could I possibly lose?Extracted from Sucker Punch: Essays by Scaachi Koul, published by StMartin’s Press on 4 March."

As the novelist, meditator and ‘accidental architect’ wins the Pritzker prize, we look at the masterful temples, caves and public spaces of this one-man antidote to Chinese bombastOliver WainwrightTue 4 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 09.04 ESTSharePensioners take their evening stroll on an elevated walkway, surrounded by lush thickets of bamboo, as a game of five-a-side football kicks off on a sunken pitch below. Around them, forming a huge C-shaped courtyard, rises a five-storey stack of streets in the sky, where signs advertise everything from yoga and dance studios to skincare clinics, barbecue restaurants and computer programming classes for kids. A long, sloping ramp connects the different levels, knitting the structure together in a zigzag promenade that culminates on the roof, framing views out over the sprawling Chinese megacity ofChengdu.This multi-levelled landscape of leisure, culture and commerce,known as West Village, is the work of architectLiu Jiakun, who has been named as the recipient of this year’s Pritzker prize, the world’s highest accolade in architecture. His is a name that few outside China will know, and yet within the country he is respected as one of the masters of his generation. Over the last four decades he has quietly built an exemplary body of work, mostly in the south-west province of Sichuan, ranging from museums and universities to public spaces and urban plans. Each of his projects channels the spirit of its place, forming carefully crafted backdrops to everyday life – free from the bombast and swagger of much contemporary architecture in China.View image in fullscreenMulti-levelled wonder … aerial view of West Village by Liu Jiakun.Photograph: CHIN HYOSOOK“I became an architect by accident,” says Liu, speaking through a translator in his studio in Chengdu. Like the man, his office is unassuming, housed in a nondescript tenement building where he also runs a small cafe and gallery. “My teacher told me that the subject would allow me to practise drawing, but I didn’t know more than that when I applied for university.”He is only the second Chinese citizen to receive the Pritzker prize, followingWang Shu in 2012, which is hardly surprising, given that private practice was outlawed in China until the 1990s. The jury praised Liu’s ability to use “Chinese tradition without nostalgia, but as a springboard for innovation”, creating “new architecture that is at once a historical record, a piece of infrastructure, a landscape and a remarkable public space.”Born in 1956, on the eve of the great Chinese famine, Liu spent much of his childhood at the hospital where his mother worked. He was sent to the countryside for three years during the Cultural Revolution to work the land, and applied to university when the institutions reopened in the late 1970s. On graduation in 1982, he worked briefly at the state-run Chengdu Architectural Design and Research Institute, but found the experience dispiriting. “It was a day job,” he says, “but my real interest was in writing.”He left architecture and spent the next decade in Tibet and China’s western province of Xinjiang, where he practised painting, writing and meditation, producing several works of fiction. His dystopian 1999 novel, Bright Moonlight Plan, followed an architect’s futile struggle to build an ideal new town, taking inspiration from Le Corbusier’s tyrannicalRadiant Cityplan (which would have bulldozed the centre of Paris) and the Soviet and Chinese communist revolutions.View image in fullscreenPerched by a river in a bamboo forest … inside Luyeyuan Stone Museum.Photograph: Jiakun Architects“There is an intrinsic relationship between architecture and literature,” says Liu. “Both involve the observation of society, and acute attention to human behaviour.” Both also require patience: it took 15 years to see his novel published inChina.Liu finally returned to architecture in his 40s, setting up his practice in 1999, after his interest was rekindled by visiting an exhibition with an old classmate. Private architecture practice was still a novelty in China, and Liu provocatively named his studio after his given name, Jiakun – a bold, personal contrast to the anonymity of the state-owned design institutes. “It seemed like a simple choice to me,” he says, “but people thought it was a pretentious, daring move at the time.”His first building, completed in 2002, wasthe small Luyeyuan Museum, for a private collection of ancient Buddhist sculptures, set by a river in a bamboo forest on the outskirts of Chengdu. Reached via a meandering path through the forest, which rises to a bridge across a lotus pond, it has the air of encountering a lost ruin, its austere, raw concrete volumes sliced open to channel natural light across the exhibits. His series of buildings for the campus of theSichuan fine arts institute, completed in 2004, have a similarly monolithic quality, standing as a cluster of chiselled redbrick volumes on a hilltop, their pitched and butterfly roofs giving them the look of a rocky outcrop.View image in fullscreen‘I always start by finding out what the local construction workers can do’ … Liu Jiakun.Photograph: Tom Welsh for The Hyatt Foundation:The Pritzker Architecture PrizeLiu received national attention following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, which killed around 70,000 people, when he utilised some of the rubble, mixed with local wheat fibre and cement, to produce what he called“rebirth bricks”. He says: “When I visited the disaster site, I saw mountains of debris. They had to rebuild everything very quickly, and I realised the materials were right there. It was cheaper, more efficient, and stronger than using new bricks.” More than just recycling, these bricks were a poetic metaphor for the rebirth of both the material and the spiritual rebirth of the community at a time of national mourning.They became a signature of his work, most notably at theShuijingfang Museumin Chengdu, an atmospheric extension to a historic baijiu distillery, completed in 2013. In the production of the fiery white spirit, workers shovel fermenting grains into great steaming heaps inside Liu’s concrete-framed warehouses, filling the air with a sweet alcoholic scent, while daylight and fresh air filter in through clever “dragon’s mouth” shafts in the roof, designed to mimic similar features in the existing timber-framed buildings. The rugged grey bricks are offset by concrete imprinted with woven bamboo mats, used to line the formwork, adding a finer human grain to the structure.“It’s a cheap material that you can find anywhere in Sichuan,” says Liu. “I always start by finding out what the local construction workers can do, and then I design with that in mind.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDesign ReviewFree monthly newsletterOriginal, sustainable ideas and reflection from designers and crafters, plus clever, beautiful products for smarter livingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Economies were needed on this gigantic project, which covers an entire city block, stretching over 200 metres long. “I think of it like a big Sichuan hotpot,” says Liu, “combining every aspect of city life.” Recalling the plot of his novel, it was an attempt to build his own kind of urban utopia, with sports facilities, restaurants, galleries and all the things you might find on a high street. “I wanted to bring the life of the street all the way up the building,” he says.The project was a victim of its own success. After 9,000 people decided to promenade along the rooftop walkway one clear day in 2016, the authorities closed off the ramp. It was still blocked off during my visit in 2023, sadly leaving many of the upper units vacant. But Liu says it reopened again last year and life is gradually returning.His team are watched over by three cats: Huahua (Mixed), Duidui (Cross-eyed) and Xiao San (Little Third)Other notable projects include an enigmaticclock museumin Chengdu, which culminates in a momentous circular courtyard, evoking a sundial, and abrick museumin Suzhou. More recently, he has completed the revitalisation of ahistoric temple neighbourhood in Lishui, and the renovation ofa dramatic cliffside cave complex in Luzhou– both of which stitch together historic fabric with slender steel and bamboo pavilions.Back in his studio, Liu’s small team is now busy working on their biggest project yet:the transformation of a former steelworks into a park, in the eastern city of Hangzhou, rambling across a 45-hectare site. Watched over by the three beloved office cats – Huahua (Mixed), Duidui (Cross-eyed), Xiao San (Little Third), who appear, Godzilla-like, in various drawings and models – the architects refine the design of additions and walkways that will thread their way through the industrial site. Like much of Jiakun Architects’ work, it will be a subtle combination of old and new, using careful interventions to reveal the complex layers of history, allowing the place’s stories to be told, without shouting at full volume.“I always aspire to be like water,” says Liu, “to permeate through a place without carrying a fixed form of my own and to seep into the local environment and the site itself. Over time, the water gradually solidifies, transforming into architecture, and perhaps even into the highest form of human spiritual creation. Yet it still retains all the qualities of that place, both good and bad.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureChinaAwards and prizesAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She indicated in her tone that the fault, if not theirs, definitely wasn’t hers, and she meant the documentary recently pulled from iPlayer, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone.Although the tone was pretty punchy throughout, they observed the fundamental courtesy of the committee, that you do all the boring stuff before you get to the interesting bit. So this account will not be chronological.Background: the documentary described the assault on Gaza through the eyes of children, and featured one 14-year-old, Abdullah al-Yazouri, whose father is Dr Ayman al-Yazouri, a member of Hamas. Even that statement is contested, though – he’s the deputy agriculture minister in Gaza’s Hamas-run government, and Labour’s Rupa Huq likened the situation to Iraq where you had to be a member of the Ba’ath party even to be a doctor. So maybe the father is not a terrorist but a functionary, was her inference, and they’ve “thrown the baby out with the bathwater” in pulling the documentary.The phrase was unfortunate, given that this programme was entirely babies and no bathwater. The Tory member Damian Hinds, though, felt that “on a precautionary principle” the documentary should never have been aired in the first place, given that Hamas is the administration in Gaza, and therefore theBBCmust have had questions about Hamas’s involvement or cooperation that the production company wouldn’t have been able to answer satisfactorily. Labour’s Paul Waugh felt that the documentary should be recut with Abdullah redacted, because the testimony of the other children was valid. Labour’s James Frith thought the opposite, that we should see the documentary as it went out initially, or not at all, “or indeed, though the eyes of an Israeli child”.It would take extraordinarily subtle minds, then, to satisfy this committee, which on the one hand wants the BBC, as the world’s leading public service broadcaster, to cover Gaza, yet on the other believes that any access to the strip must have come at the price of treating with terrorists. Those weren’t the minds we had, unfortunately. Davie was flustered by the question of which complaints he’d had from whom, repeating terms so broad – “different people”, “various organisations” – as to be meaningless.Failings in pulled Gaza documentary a ‘dagger to the heart’ of BBC’s credibility, says chairRead more“If you think we bow to lobbyists from either side, come spend a day with me,” he concluded, which was less weak than the stock BBC response (“We must be impartial because both sides are equally angry”) but only fractionally. Shah tried to bore the panel into submission with a long thought out loud about how children’s perspectives were valuable and that would have been a great way to cover Northern Ireland, now he came to think about it. That was never going to work; they’re a committee, it is not possible to bore them. Consequently, they had to leave this issue as they’d found it: a hot-button internal inquiry had found fault on both sides, the BBC’s and Hoyo’s, the production company’s. Davie and Shah would do a “deep dive” and report back.The bulk of the meeting was taken up with charter renewal and funding. In an ideal world, Shah said, they’d figure out what a modern BBC was for first and then decide how to fund it, but since that’s not the world we’re in, the conversations would have to happen concurrently.In practice, this means they mainly talk about money, although Labour’s Tom Rutland had some interesting questions about “mutualisation”, how the broadcaster could improve the public’s sense of ownership and involvement without getting overrun by the strident voices of activists. Davie talked about “a ladder of involvement – comment boards, all the way up to lots of ideas”, and pray God nobody tries to stand on that ladder, it doesn’t seem to have any rungs.Waugh asked him about reorganising the licence fee along progressive lines, so that rich people pay more, and he replied: “It reminds me of one of those old-fashioned graphic equalisers, if I may.” Waugh, neutrally, went back for a better answer than that word salad and didn’t get one. “The issue is what’s acceptable, what’s the right balance? That ensures the licence fee or whatever emerges from it is good value?” I’m not saying anyone else would want his job, because this looked extremely painful. But it was peculiar to watch him perform it with so little intellectual elbow grease.And peculiar, too, that it was Shah rather than Davie in whom Dinenage repeatedly mentioned her disappointment, specifically his reluctance “to opine … What we want from the chair of the BBC are some strong views.” Discussing criminal prosecutions for licence fee evasion, he said he was uncomfortable with it but decriminalising would cost two or three hundred million quid a year. Everyone piled in on him at that point, how extraordinary it was for him to bemoan prosecutions and yet have no intention of dropping them, as if he were a commentator rather than the chair.At which point he did stand up for himself and say (in so many words) if you guys want to give us back the money we used to get for the World Service, or pay for the free licences for over-75s, then sure we can decriminalise. It was a little bright spot of trenchant and sequential thought, fired off in self-defence, reminding me of what a public speaking expert once said: “Everyone’s a great orator when they’re arguing with their boyfriend.”Explore more on these topicsBBCThe politics sketchTim DavieSamir ShahcommentShareReuse this content"

And not in a good wayMarina HydeA whole political and cultural era is passing, and who better than the Duchess of Sussex as a symbol of all we have left behindTue 4 Mar 2025 07.22 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 08.10 ESTShareAre peonies a life philosophy? Are “life philosophies” even philosophy? I have to hold on to the idea that they aren’t, even in the face of a decade or so of Instagram blitzkrieg, most currently in the form of Duchess Meghan’s eight-part new TV show, which dropped onNetflixfirst thing this morning. With Love, Meghan seems to have migrated fully formed from Mark Zuckerberg’s social media platform on to Ted Sarandos’s streaming service, powered by the hashtags that bypass the need for joined-up sentences, let alone thinking. Or as Her Grace explains: “Everyone’s invited to create wonder in every moment.” This is an offer not even promised by most major religions.The mildest way to describe this show is as a ghastly artefact of a particular cultural era that recently met its apocalypse. But more on that later. To anyone who says, “It’s just meant to be fun”: bullshit. Netflix reportedly paid $100m (£78m) to Prince Harry and the manic pixie dream duchess for an overall deal, so for the streamer it’s meant to make back at least a small amount of the big amount of money they’ve lost, when audiences failed to connect with the Sussex-authored documentaries about global justice activists and polo. For Meghan, it’s supposed to assist her transformation into domestic guru. If you don’t mind arching an eyebrow at the lifestyle lunacies offellow Montecito resident Gwyneth Paltrow, then at least have some consistency and give yourself a pass on this one. This show is sensationally absurd and trite, and if you watch it, you know it.Language is either category-five twee or has been reduced to non-sentient babyspeak. “Good vibes, good hives”. “Clean clean clean clean.” “Single skillet spaghetti. S-s-s. S-s-s …” I won’t labour the 1% of the 1% mood, though someone driving through one of America’s most rarefied billionaires’ communities to buy a few hundred dollars’ worth of flowers while telling you, “It’s the little things that count” is obviously ridiculous. As is referring to a bucket as a “garbage vessel”. Nor will I, “as a woman”, do more than note that you don’t see successful men spending for ever on all this stuff. Zuckerberg and Sarandos presumably decided a very long time ago that part of the goal is to not even know where your kitchen is.View image in fullscreenA still from With Love, Meghan.Photograph: Jenna Peffley/NetflixOf much more interest is how these Insta-perfect worlds have grabbed people by the throat and siphoned away so much of their valuable time and attention in recent years. Scrolling the platform or watching Meghan’s show (they are almost identical sensory experiences), you note how much of the language is explicitly religious. Time is described as “sacred”, practices are “rituals”, people are continually feeling “blessed”, snacks are “an offering”, the emphasis is on “honouring” this or that. It becomes hard not to see all the flower frogs and rosemary sprigs and garbage vessels as holy kit, arranged in esoteric fashion as if to summon a form of peace. Or rather, #peace. But peace through retail, always – even if the product turns out to be you.It’s amusing to learn from publicists and Meghan herself that the duchess’s artisan this-and-thats will be available in the Netflix brick-and-mortar stores opening this year. Other eras have had their epicureans or hedonists, of course, who lived and sometimes died for the ideal of simplicity or pleasure in an epic kind of way. But today’s gazillion-strong influencer community has zero intellectual underpinning to it, which is why it’s so often the unwitting butt of its own joke. I’m trying to picture Oscar Wilde being told Netflix is going to sell limited edition artisan Oscar Wilde buttonholes in its shop, and him just fainting at the obvious horror of it all.Sorry to press an unmodernised yet perfectly adequate word into action, but of course all this stuff is perfectlynice. It’s nice if the table is laid nicely, it’s lovely if the flowers are lovely, it’s caring of you to make people feel cared for, whatever that really means. (I wonder if the truly selfless tablescape actually exists – Meghan’s entire MO feels desperately “compliments to the hostess”.) As I say, it’s allnice. But it’s neither a long nor an interesting conversation – at best it should serve as a backdrop to one. And yet over the past rise-of-the-influencer decade, it seems to havebecomethe conversation.The great Harry and Meghan debate rages on – but I’m staying out of it | Zoe WilliamsRead moreDecades often seem to be about certain things, before another, defining thing sneaks in under the radar. The 2000s seemed to be about celebrity culture and Islamist fundamentalism, but in retrospect the 2008 financial crash – both its causes and the failure to deliver justice in its aftermath – was the key event. The 10 years we have just lived through might have seemed to be about social media and what came to be summarised as woke culture. But a global fracturing was stealing under the radar.It certainly isn’t any more. In fact, watching With Love, Meghan early this morning already felt like a past washing over me, so much so that I decided that maybe – and please stay with me for this hot take – maybe, Meghan has made a landmark TV series after all. Immerse yourself in it for an episode or eight, and you instinctively feel that both the show and the duchess embody the age that has become suddenly bygone. And that is the exact feeling that countless people have been experiencing since this year turned – that an era is dying. Or rather, that it has already died, and suddenly. There were many others, but Meghan was as good an avatar for it as any – torn between wildly ineffective social justice activism, and the narcotising retreat of the peonied table. But this is now over, and I think we can all feel it in our bones. Rest in peace/power/whatever. But godspeed to something else – something better – being born.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was bad advice – and Zelenskyy should ignore it. In any case he doesn’t have much choice.The US president and his team have since made it clear that they want his scalp as part of their plan to rush through a ceasefire deal with Moscow that would leave Ukraine partitioned, without US or Nato security guarantees, but with US companies pouring in to exploit its strategic minerals. In the mafia style that he wields so convincingly, Trump unleashed his attack dogs to call for Zelenskyy’s removal,and declared“this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing”. Then he pulled the plug on US military assistance to Kyiv in an attempt to force Ukraine to its knees and impose Vladimir Putin’s terms for an end to the fighting.It is now abundantly clear that theTrump administrationisn’t interested in mending fences with Zelenskyy, so he would merely court more humiliation without gaining extra arms supplies or security guarantees if he went crawling to his tormentors now. The man who refused to surrender to Putin’s invasion should not yield now to Trump’s ultimatums and extortion.He would do better to pressure his European supporters to deliver fast on their promises, while dangling the same reward of access to Ukrainian rare earths if they do so. This could become part of a package for an accelerated EU accession process for Kyiv.If Trump goes further, as he may well do, and cuts off the US intelligence feed to Ukraine and access to Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite communications, European countries must step in fast to help Kyiv using theEU’s government satellite networkto avoid being totally blinded. The US should beware of taking such steps, which would signal to allies around the world that neither its security partnership nor its tech companies can be relied on for dependable service in a crisis.The White House train wreck happened so fast that someEuropean leadersare still struggling to catch up with the significance of the event. That’s understandable, since it upended their mental universe, in which the transatlantic bond was always the bedrock of European security, enabling them to live in prosperity for decades without spending too much on defence because they were under a protective US shield.Within hours of the Oval Office bust-up, Rutte said it was “important that President Zelenskyy finds a way to restore his relationship with the American president and with the senior American leadership team”. You can’t blame him for trying to hold together the alliance that pays his wages and that has kept the peace in Europe for 75 years. But Rutte is in denial about the new reality in Washington. It will take time to adjust, but we don’t have that time.Likewise,Starmer’s call for bridge-buildingand mending relationships with the US, even as he declared Britain’sfull support for Ukraine, was an exercise in mental gymnastics at a time when the Trump administration has decided to throw Kyiv under the bus in the quest for a new bonanza in relations with Russia. The UK’s security is so intertwined with the US, including the closest of intelligence-sharing relationships and reliance on US components and targeting software for its nuclear deterrent, that no British leader ever wants to face the nightmare choice between loyalty to Ukraine’s just cause and the so-called special relationship with Washington.It’s now up to the Europeans, including the UK, to show they are willing to go on supporting Ukraine practically, by emptying their ammunition stocks to keep Kyiv supplied and ramping up industrial production to deliver a steady flow of shells. They must remove remainingself-imposed restrictionson allowing Ukraine to use medium-range missiles to strike Russian bases and supply lines. And they must draw up practical plans for a security force to support Ukraine after a ceasefire with the assumption of little or no US support, despite Starmer’s plea for a US backstop.Zelenskyy cuts both a heroic and a tragic figure. He embodied Ukrainian resistance to tyranny whenRussiastruck, he has been a brave war leader under fire, yet now he increasingly looks like a martyr, to be torn asunder between a vengeful Putin and an unscrupulous Trump.But Zelenskyy andUkrainecan still emerge from this war as the successful defenders of their own and Europe’s freedom, provided European countries now back him to the hilt. Even if they cannot recover every inch of stolen territory, Ukrainians should fight on under Zelenskyy’s leadership and with European support for a fairer peace.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In light of the resignation of two fellows and an open lettersigned by nearly 3,500 scientists, many, including me, expected the discussion to be focused on the behaviour of one particular fellow: Elon Musk.The Royal Society, as one of the world’s most esteemed scientific institutions, bears the responsibility of maintaining standards among its fellows. Musk, admitted as a fellow in 2018 for his technological innovations, has recently engaged in behaviour thatcontravenes the society’s code of conduct. In particular, many scientists have taken issue with his assault on the conduct of science in the US and beyond as head of the Trump administration’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) as well as his malicious accusations against public scientists (such asAnthony Fauci) andother public figures.Musk is an important figure (some would arguethe mostimportant) in a US administration that is laying siege to science and to scientific inquiry itself. The new administration’s executive orders have restricted research,silenced climate scientistsandcut fundingas part of asystematic targetingof the scientific community.In taking action against a member whose behaviour is so openly in opposition to the society’s values and code of conduct, theRoyal Societywould have affirmed its commitment to ethical standards and helped to reinforce public trust in science.So I was more than disappointed to read thestatement released by the Royal Societyafter the meeting, which made no mention at all of Musk. The statement did recognise “the need to stand up for science and for scientists around the world in the face of the growing challenges science faces”, but without clear action to address Musk’s position, these words ring hollow.The Royal Society’s code of conduct for fellows states that “Fellows and Foreign Members shall not act orfail to actin any way which would undermine the Society’s mission or bring the Society into disrepute”. It is clear that Musk’s behaviour has contravened this rule. So why, even now, has the Royal Society not spoken out specifically against his actions?View image in fullscreenDr Anthony Fauci is one of the public figures Elon Musk has spoken of maliciously.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesSome have argued that expelling Muskcould harm public trust in science; that by blurring the boundaries between science and politics, the society would damage science’s integrity. I believe this perspective overlooks the critical role that scientific institutions play in upholding ethical standards and defending the integrity of science, especially at times when science and scientists are subject to threats and intimidation from political institutions.I was once told towards the beginning of my career: “Everything is political, especially the things that people tell you are not political. Those are the most political of all”. There is some truth in that when it comes to science. The intersection of science and politics is both inescapable and of vital importance. Scientists possess unique expertise that is crucial for informed policymaking and societal progress. Embracing political engagement allows scientists to fulfil their ethical responsibilities, defend the integrity of their work and contribute meaningfully to addressing the complex challenges facing society today.Disengaging in the political issues that surround and influence science is not the virtue that some commentators would have you believe. If anything, it is a betrayal of the profound impact that science can and should have on the world. In particular, a failure to act on Musk’s behaviour will only embolden those who seek to exert political influence over science and scientists – and erode the foundational principles of science.Elon Musk survives as fellow of Royal Society despite anger among scientistsRead moreSo for me it’s time to take a stand, small as it may be, and to distance myself from the Royal Society until such a time as it has the moral courage to specifically denounce the actions that Musk is taking to undermine science in the US and elsewhere. I will be resigning my position as associate editor at the Royal Society’s journalOpen Sciencewith immediate effect. I will no longer submit my research to Royal Society journals or act as a peer reviewer for them. I would urge my colleagues to do the same.The Royal Society is correct in its statement that it needs to “advocate for science and scientists at a time when these are under threat as never before and yet at the same time have never been more necessary for humanity at large” – but without the society taking concrete action to enforce its own rules and defend its own scientific integrity, I’m not sure I can have confidence in it to advocate for the broader scientific community.Kit Yates is professor of mathematical biology and public engagement at the University of Bath and author ofThe Maths of Life and DeathandHow to Expect the UnexpectedDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now – four years and one chief executive later –the nonsense has been stopped. Aberdeen it is, albeit the group still can’t manage an upper case “A”.“One of the easiest decisions I have ever had to make,” said its new boss, Jason Windsor, undoing the handiwork of his predecessor, Stphn Brd. One doesn’t doubt it.The original guff about having a “modern, agile and digitally enabled brand” was always likely to collide with the reality that a name that causes the reader to pause for breath doesn’t work unless you’re sending a text message.Abrdn executives seem to have spent half their time explaining the pronunciation, or inviting fresh ridicule bygrumbling about the wicked media’s “childish jokes”.The other excuse, back in 2021, was that Scotland’s oil capital had already bagged the relevant website domain names, obliging the company to do something different.That supposedly insurmountable obstacle has now been removed by becoming, in full, “aberdeen group”, which should not have required great genius. Sir Douglas Flint, the soon-to-depart chair who is normally a plain speaker, could have saved a lot of bother by insisting on common sense at the outset.Still, at least the numbers are looking better after years of disappointment for shareholders. The recent cost-cutting should be more lasting than the adventures in removing vowels.Operating profits, after normal adjustments, rose 2% to £255m despite lower revenues. It was the group’s first profits growth for three years. It was also possible to glimpse, for the first time in ages, how this three-legged financial services creation might be able to move forwards in a straight line.The group is the product of a grand 2017 merger that was a mashup of free-wheeling Aberdeen and sedateStandard Lifebut has changed immeasurably since then, notably via the 2018 sale of the insurance businesses to Phoenix.In today’s form, Aberdeen comprises a traditional fund management business, albeit one that must specialise in fields such as emerging markets and real estate to avoid the giant US index trackers; a service platform for independent financial advisers; and Interactive Investor, the retail platform for DIY retail investors that was acquired on Bird’s watch for £1.5bn.The mix is now styled as a “wealth and investments group” and, despite its oddness, all three units ought to be capable of growth and staying under the same roof.In his other eye-catching move, Windsor, promoted from chief financial officer a year after arrival from Aviva, started by setting a target for operating profits – £300m in 2026, or about a fifth better than the 2024 outcome – which read as a statement of confidence. The shares rose 7%, a rare experience for investors in recent years.We’ve been here before with this company, of course. In his time, ex-Citigroup Bird was also presented as a new broom. But ditching the distraction of a ridiculous name is a credibility-enhancing start.Other companies take note: if you have to ask how to pronounce a new name, you’ve got the wrong one. The only exception is Relx, the brilliantly performing (and two syllable) analytics business that is now the UK’s fifth largest listed company.Explore more on these topicsInsurance industryNils Pratley on financeAberdeen Asset ManagementStandard LifecommentShareReuse this content"

But combined with infrastructure investment, protectionism can be a progressive boonTue 4 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 12.37 ESTShareIn the run-up to the 2024 election, a lot of people were ringing alarms about Donald Trump’s tariffs. Kamala HarriscalledTrump’s policies a “tax on the American people” and warned of sky-high prices. According to the Nobel prize-winning economistJoseph Stiglitz, they are “very bad for America and for the world”. His fellow Nobel laureatePaul Krugmancalled them “small, ugly, and stupid”. More recently, the whirlwind tariff drama of the past two months – first a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada, then a 30-day “pause” on that policy, aplanto raise tariffs on steel, aluminum and agricultural goods, plus an across the board tariff hike on China – has generated yet more frenzied debate about the danger of tariffs.Observers aren’t wrong to criticize the US president’s policies. His proposed tariffs seem unlikely to improve what ails the US economy. Worse, applying tariffs as broadly as he’s proposed, and without any supplementary industrial strategy, does risk needlessly raising prices while acting like a big corporate giveaway. Yet, despite what elite economists say, tariffs can be sound, and progressive, economic policy.In fact, liberals might be surprised to learn that during his administration Joe Biden actually raised the highest tariffs in recent American history: a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles. Why? Because tariffs work.Despite what elite economists say, tariffs can be sound, and progressive, economic policyTariffs are, simply put, taxes on certain imported goods, paid by the importer. The goal is to make foreign products more expensive than their Made-In-USA counterparts. This is why people refer to tariffs as “walls” that help “protect” domestic industry from global competition. Right now,Chinaquickly and efficiently produces fleets of electric vehicles that are – thanks to the low cost of Chinese labor – a lot cheaper than the EVs made in the United States. Without tariffs, it would be impossible for US-made models to compete. Since making electric cars was a big goal for Biden, his administration raised an eye-watering tariff that would double the price of any Chinese-made import.The EV example is useful because it demonstrates the difference between Biden’s tariff policies and Trump’s.Trump has, for the most part, not focused on raising tariffs on particular imported goods but instead on all goods coming from certain countries. Mexico andCanadaface across-the-board tariffs; China was already facing 10% tariffs, doubling to 20%. But raising the prices of all products from these countries doesn’t help develop any particular line of US manufacturing. Tariffs like these are both too broad and too small to make a positive impact. A 20% tariff on all Chinese goods might make it more expensive for Americans to continue to buy certain things from China. But nothing in that policy encourages Americans to buy American-made products; they might just as well find a Vietnamese supplier to avoid the tariff while continuing to reap the benefits of cheap labor. Moreover, it’s possible that some Chinese manufacturers will simply eat the additional costs and sell their goods at slightly slimmer profit margins. Or, equally likely, they will try to avoid the tariffs by having other companies assemble their products in neighboring countries before sending them to the US. As is, Trump’s country-based tariffs seem more like a geopolitical tool than an economic one. Frankly, they don’t make much sense if the goal is to bring factories home.Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs are closer to the mark. By making all steel imports (regardless of national origin) subject to thesametariff, the policy could succeed in making US steel comparatively cheaper for domestic buyers.View image in fullscreen‘Raising the prices of all products from these countries doesn’t help develop any particular line of American manufacturing.’Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesYet even this wouldn’t make US steel bigger or better, or make its production more efficient. Nor would it necessarily raise the wages of steel workers. Pure and simple protectionism will benefit existing US steel manufacturers, but no one much beyond that. Without the government stepping in to develop new manufacturing – encouraging the adoption of the latest techniques to make a superior product, actively building new demand for American steel, or providing social guarantees for steel workers – tariffs alone risk protecting a sick industry without much upside.So what would a labor-forward tariff program look like? It would combine tariffs with big investments in infrastructure to help steer industry, and the country, into better economic health.For steel, such a fix isn’t hard to imagine. The US benefits from being a continental-sized country, with hundreds of thousands of bridges, school buildings, libraries, miles of rail and highway. All of those things are made with steel. And all of them are falling apart. Major new investments in infrastructure upgrades would provide the tariff-protected steel industry the new demand needed to grow, and provide the requisite scale for industrial dynamism.Trump thinks antagonising China will help save the US economy. He couldn’t be more wrong | Melanie BrusselerRead moreIn exchange, steel firms should be required to provide family-sustaining wages and benefits, and promise to stay neutral in union elections. Not only this, but the government should have some say in actually directing the production process. New steel plants should be built in places that need jobs, not isolated tax-free industrial parks, but in the very same areas that were obliterated by deindustrialization. That is, production should be directed, first and foremost, toward public use and social ends.Some might wonder: why bother with such an expensive experiment?Manufacturing is still a huge part of the US economy and it is among the only sectors that consistently provides high wages for a large base of workers. Protecting that industrial foundation is essential not only for those workers, but for the health of other sectors too. When a factory closes, it’s not just the high-wage blue-collar workers who are thrown out of jobs. So are all the middle-income truck drivers who deliver the goods. And all the high-skilled mechanics who fix the machines. Not to mention the servers and cooks who staff now empty local restaurants. The only businesses that grow in the wake of a factory closing are those related to opioids and alcohol.Since Nafta was signed,tens of thousandsof factories have closed in the US. Millions of largely union jobs have been lost. This fact alone explains so much of the populist revolt against globalization. And while it’s unlikely that we could ever return to the industrial output of 1946, is it that hard to imagine returning to 1994? If Pearl Jam is still making albums, can’t the US still make steel?Rebuilding our manufacturing capacity will be a big part of building a better country. And tariffs – deployed wisely with big investments – are an indispensable tool for doing so.Dustin Guastella is a research associate at the Center for Working Class Politics and the director of operations for Teamsters Local 623Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpChinaMexicoCanadacommentShareReuse this content"

Chalk up another win for Project 2025Tue 4 Mar 2025 09.54 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 12.20 ESTShareSome politicians go whichever way the wind blows. Not, however, the US’s esteemed leader, Donald Trump. He is such a force of nature that he can dictate the direction of the wind. During his first term, hesuggested “nuking hurricanes”to stop them from hitting the country. A few weeks after that, Trump seemed to think he could alter the course of Hurricane Dorian with a black marker,scribbling over an official mapto change its anticipated trajectory in an incidentnow known as Sharpiegate. Weirdly, Dorian did not end up following Trump’s orders. Hurricanes can be uncooperative like that.Six weeks into Trump’s second term, the president hasn’t bombed any hurricanes, but he has nuked the US’s weather-forecasting capabilities. Last week, hundreds of workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US’s pre-eminent climate research agency,were abruptly fired.Experts and lawmakers have warned that the ramifications could be wide-ranging and deadly. “Ships will not be able to safely navigate through our waterways. Farmers will not have the data they need to manage their crops,” Maria Cantwell, a Democratic senator from Washington,said in a statement. “This action is a direct hit to our economy, because Noaa’s specialised workforce provides products and services that support more than a third of the nation’s GDP.”Doesn’t sound ideal, does it? I know this is a bit like asking why water is wet, but why is the Trump-Musk administration being so reckless? Why are they waging war on the weather?Partly because someone stands to get rich from of all this, one imagines. The Noaa cuts may be shocking, but they weren’t surprising. Republicans have long been pushing to limit the government’s role in weather forecasting in order to privatise large sections of it. This plan was clearlylaid out in Project 2025, a blueprint for the Trump administration, which recommended that the National Weather Service, run by Noaa, should “fully commercialize its forecasting operations” and focus on providing data to private companies.There is always money to be made from dismantling government services. Elon Musk’s businesses havereceived at least $38bn(£30bn) in government contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits, according to a Washington Post analysis. It certainly wouldn’t be shocking if Musk’s vast Starlink satellite network – which Dutch meteorologists once warned was interfering withsatellite measurementsthat are indispensable for accurate weather forecasts – suddenly got somelucrative weather-related government contracts.Privatisation of a public good isn’t all bad news, though: we can probably expect exciting innovation. Subscription-based disaster services, perhaps. For just $9.99 a month, you can access exclusive information about whether a hurricane or wildfire is heading to your neighbourhood! Opt for the $999 a month plan and getprivate firefighters dispatched to your doorwhile the poor watch their homes burn!Of course, Trump’s war on the weather isn’t just about money; it’s also about science denialism. Project 2025 claims that Noaa should be dismantled because it is “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry”. If we get rid of data about the climate crisis, then it’s bound to go away, isn’t it? Remember whenTrump advocated a similar approachto Covid? He said: “If we stop testing right now, we’d have very few cases, if any.” Hard to argue with toddler logic.Ultimately, however, the attacks on Noaa show that even the weather has been swept up in the culture wars. It used to be a safe topic, something you could chat about with strangers. Now, simply providing context to weather reports can get people very heated indeed. For example, during the summer 2022 heatwave in the UK, when temperatures reached record highs of 40.3C, weather forecasters such as Laura Tobin found themselves getting harassed for linking theheatwave to the climate crisis.This abuse is part of a trend. Meteorologists around the world havebeen subjected to increasing harassment. This is partly, I suspect, because, deep down, even the science deniers are fearful. There is an apt tweet about the climate crisisthat pops up a lot: “Climate change will manifest as a series of disasters viewed through phones with footage that gets closer and closer to where you live until you’re the one filming it.” What used to seem abstract and remote is now steadily encroaching on all our lives – even those of people living in placesonce considered climate havens. Trump can declare war on the weather all he likes, but it’s become alarmingly clear that this is a war that no one will win.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago, each day that Kyiv held out was a victory. The west rallied to Ukraine’s support at equally remarkable speed.Now, as the Trump administration turns upon the victim, and embraces the aggressor, Europe is accelerating nascent plans to bolster Ukraine and pursue security independence. Trump allies blame Friday night’s extraordinary Oval Office confrontation between Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Donald Trump and JD Vance for the shockinghalt to all US military aid. Others suspect that the administration was seeking a pretext for the suspension. Mr Zelenskyypledgedon Tuesday to “work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts” andexpressed gratitude for his first-term approval of Javelin missile defence systems sales.That may or may not be enough. The suspension concluded a fortnight in which Mr Trump attacked Mr Zelenskyy as a “dictator”, the US sided with Russia against western allies at the UN, and the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,suspendedoffensive cyber operations against Moscow. There are reports that the US is preparing plans forloosening the economic pressureon Russia – even as itimposes punitive tariffson allies. Little wonder the Kremlincrowsthat Washington “largely coincides with our vision”. Vladimir Putin hasreportedly offered to mediateUS-Iran nuclear talks. Observers were braced for further developments in the US president’saddress to Congresson Tuesday.Analysts suggest that Ukraine’s forces should be able to continue fighting at their current rate for a few months if US aid does not resume, depending on what it has stockpiled. Though it is far less dependent on the US than three years ago, key elements like Patriot air defence missiles will be hard to replace. If US logistical and intelligence assistance and Elon Musk’s Starlink’s services were suspended, those would be further punishing blows.Mr Trump is in a hurry – hence his angrythreatthat Mr Zelenskyy “won’t be around very long” if he doesn’t cut a deal. This came after the Ukrainian president suggested on Sunday that the end of the war was “very, very far away”. Yet he has also squandered leverage he might have exerted on Moscow before reaching the table. He has emboldened Russia to pursue further territorial gains, especially if it can shape a deal with the USbefore a ceasefire.The US has alreadyunderminedcentral pillars of Sir Keir Starmer’s approach – maintaining military support for Kyiv and economic pressure on Moscow, and creating a “coalition of the willing” to guarantee Ukrainian security. Mr Vancederided“20,000 troops from some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years”, then claimed that he was not referring to Britain or France.European leaders must continue trying to buy time, deferring further US perfidy, and hasten rearmament for themselves and Ukraine. On Tuesday, Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, announceda proposal, including changes to EU fiscal rules, which she said could mobilise nearly €800bn for defence spending. A rival operator to Starlink isin talkswith European leaders about satellite services.But this is an administration which moves abruptly and erratically.Ukraineand Europe are racing against the clock, not knowing when zero hour will arrive. It is likely to be sooner rather than later.Explore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpUS politicsVladimir PutinRussiaEuropeeditorialsShareReuse this content"

He found a bedsit and a job in Burger King, while waiting to take on the capital’s club and fashion scenes. That same year, the former New Musical Express and Smash Hits editorNick Loganlaunched the magazine the Face on a shoestring from a basement on Carnaby Street.Bowerybecame one of the most influential avant garde figures of the era,the Face the “style bible”for a generation.Now these countercultural icons are being celebrated in shows at Tate Modern and theNational Portrait Gallery. It doesn’t get more mainstream. Over at Tate Britain, meanwhile, there is a sombre, largely black and whitephotographic retrospective of the decade.Outlaws, focusing on Bowery and his circle, is currently at London’s Fashion and Textile Museum; later this yearthe Design Museumwill showcase the pop culture magazineBlitz, also founded in 1980. The 80s are having a moment.Documenting the decade’s collisions of fashion, art and music,Leigh Bowery!at Tate Modern andThe Face Magazine: Culture Shift at the NPGare luridly colourful explosions set against a bleak backdrop of Thatcherite austerity, racism and homophobia. One film montage shows Bowery and friends doing poppers superimposed on footage of the Brixton and Toxteth riots and headlines about Aids. They are partying while the world burns.Post-punk and before the Young British Artists of the 1990s, Bowery and the Face were in opposition to the conservatism – and Conservatism – then dominating the country. Both set up their own clubs: Bowery literally with Taboo in the West End of London in 1985, the Face in its pages. Anyone could belong, regardless of class, race or sexuality, so long as they looked awesome. Taboo’s mantra was “dress as though your life depends on it, or don’t bother”.A photograph of Bowery – painted blue – appears in the exhibition about the Face. Constantly shapeshifting, Bowery strode through artistic milieux in sparkly platform boots. “If you label me, you negate me,” he liked to say. In 1988 he put ona five-day solo performance, spotlit behind a two-way mirror, striking poses in a variety of his signature “looks”. Later, he became amuse to Lucian Freud. Bowery’s reinvention and exhibitionism anticipates the narcissism and voyeurism of social media. His whole life was a selfie.In some ways, it was a better time to be young and an artist. Squats, council flats and even Margaret Thatcher’sEnterprise Allowance Scheme(everyone at the Face in its early days was on it, apparently) meant vibrant artistic communities could flourish in the capital. Despite the debauchery, there was an innocence and spontaneity to this underground scene and its make-do-and-mend aesthetic – although some of their most provocative stunts now seem dated at best. As the criticAdrian Searle puts it: “Wherever Bowery went, he went too far.”Bowery died of an Aids-related illness in 1994 and, although the Face would continue for another decade, it was the last hurrah for British youth magazines. Pop culture was about to become globally homogenised by the internet. The party had to end.There are economic, political and social parallels between the 1980s and today. Bowery and the Face showed that creativity could grow out of grim times. With their emphasis on gender fluidity, diversity and experimentalism, they were trailblazers. They deserve entry to the UK’s most prestigious galleries – and they still look awesome.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromTim ConwayandChris JonesTue 4 Mar 2025 11.24 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 11.27 ESTShareYour reporting (28 February) of the overseas aid cuts highlights a worrying myopia among aid NGOs about Britain’s evolving challenges. This generational moment demands more than the simplistic equation of aid spending with security. The 138 NGOs calling these cuts the single largest in history overlook profound shifts: Donald Trump’s return, Russia’s aggression and rising global instability. Britain’s security and diplomatic influence depend on robust military capabilities, especially when our alliance with the US becomes less certain.The issue is not percentage targets (0.5% to 0.3%), it is how effective aid is. Now that significant aid funds areredirected to asylum and refugee supportat home, we must reassess whether our approach meaningfully affects global development. Critics of these cuts ignore political reality. The “forgotten” people most vulnerable to populism want the government to focus on the NHS, education, the cost of living and border security. To present aid as sacrosanct while domestic services struggle widens the disconnect. David Lammy’s proposal to use frozen Russian assets for Ukraine shows creative thinking. This is far more relevant than clinging to outdated spending targets.This is not about destroying Labour’s legacy, it is about responding to a dramatically changed world. We have to balance humanitarian concerns with Britain’s interests in an increasingly unstable landscape. In 2025, security really does require a joined-up strategy. Defence, targeted aid and domestic priorities must work together. Clinging to old orthodoxies will not serve us.Anthony LawtonMarket Harborough, LeicestershireThe government’s plan tocut the aid budgethas been roundly condemned by NGOs and the former head of the British army (Starmer’s cut to aid budget a ‘strategic mistake’, says former army head, 27 February). Assuming it nonetheless goes ahead, what remains is to ensure that the downsized aid budget is spent well– on places, people and problems that are genuine priorities for development. The aid budget should be brought back under the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), which is best placed to manage it, rather than scattered across government departments.The cost of supporting refugees in the UK (which took28% of the aid budget in 2023) needs to be funded from domestic budget lines, not aid. And the process of cutting back the aid programme needs to be managed exceptionally carefully. With growing global needs and a shrunken budget, choices will be brutally hard.If the UK is to retain a credible role in development, avoid the reputation-shredding effects of the Boris Johnson government’s cuts in 2022, and have a chance of building back in the future, the FCDO will need to invest in leadership and effort to minimise the damage from these cuts.Tim ConwayPrincipal consultant,poverty andsocialprotectionpractice,Oxford Policy ManagementTo help make up the shortfall in foreign aid, Labour members might like to consider withholding their subscriptions and using the money to donate to one or more of the charities left in the lurch by the government. This would not only provide a little bit of help for those who need it most, but would also send a message to Keir Starmer’s government to start acting more like Labour and less like the Tories or Reform UK.Chris JonesYorkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In Milan, Turin and Parma, where opposition was expected, the fascists took control quietly and smoothly” (As the far right surges around the globe, what can a new TV series about Mussolini teach us?, 26 February).Try telling that to the people of the neighbourhood of San Lorenzo in Rome, where numerous residents were killed by armed blackshirts during the March on Rome in October 1922. Argos Secondari was a well-known anti-fascist in Rome. He was attacked in his home by numerous fascists and savagely beaten, never recovering from his head injuries and ending his life in a psychiatric hospital. Giuseppe Lemmi, a communist, was kidnapped from the street by hundreds of blackshirts. His hair and beard were shaved, he was forced to drink castor oil, and he was paraded through the streets with humiliating signs around his neck. Many ordinary people were murdered in Rome and in other cities at that time, while private homes were raided and sacked.This, of course, came after a full two years of armed blackshirt violence acrossItaly, which saw thousands killed, many others threatened or injured, and numerous buildings linked to individuals, the trade unions or the left burned to the ground. In the summer of 1922, the blackshirts acted as a kind of occupying army, marching on entire cities like Ravenna and Bolzano, destroying buildings and murdering whoever got in their way.Far from exaggerating the violence of Italian fascism, it could be argued that Joe Wright’s series plays it down. The idea that the March on Rome was peaceful or bloodless has been comprehensively debunked by historians such as Giulia Albanese and others over the last 20 years. Yet these powerful myths about Mussolini as a buffoon, and hissquadristias a bit of a joke, survive. These are dangerous myths because they underplay the centrality of violence to Italian fascism and to its seizure of power. It might be reassuring to think that those blackshirts took over Rome “quietly”, but that is not what happened in 1922.John FootProfessor of modern Italian history, Bristol UniversityExplore more on these topicsBenito MussoliniItalyThe far rightHistory booksTelevisionJoe WrightlettersShareReuse this content"

It was just too hard without all of their injured forwards, wasn’t it? Here, Mikel Arteta’s team gave their riposte.It was one-way traffic from the outset and when Leandro Trossard got his goal, ensuring that all three of Arteta’s makeshift frontline had scored, it was 5-1 and there were only 48 minutes on the clock.PSV Eindhovenwere humiliated.Martin Ødegaard changes the narrative to make patched-up Arsenal dream big | Ed AaronsRead moreMikel Merino, who before thetrip to Leicesterfour games ago had never played as a centre-forward, scored for 3-1 and before that, there was a cracker from Ethan Nwaneri. He became the third-youngest player to find the net in a Champions League knockout tie after Bojan Krkic and Jude Bellingham and it was tempting to focus on him, to say that this was the 17-year-old’s night above all of the others.Players of Nwaneri’s age should not have such intelligence with their runs, such composure in possession, such assurance with their decision-making. And that is before we talk about the sharpness of his turns, the blistering acceleration.Yet that would be to do plenty of others a disservice – especially the captain, Martin Ødegaard. When he ran through to score his second goal for 6-1, there was applause for him from some of the PSV fans by the press box. At times, it looked as though he was playing with his own ball.It was a night to make early checks on Arsenal’s previous record away wins in theChampions League. For the record, they were the 5-1 against Inter in 2003 and the 4-0 – PSV again – in 2002. They were surpassed. The two legs of this last‑16 meeting had been talked up as make‑or-break for the prolongation of Arsenal’s season. Now, the feelgood factor is back, the excitement crackling about a quarter-final against one of the Madrid clubs. By then, Gabriel Martinelli and possibly Bukayo Saka could have recovered from their injuries.The soundtrack to the occasion was provided by the sighs of the home support. What has happened to PSV? The Dutch champions were flying when the Eredivisie broke for winter, six points clear at the top. They now lag eight behind the new leaders, Ajax, having won only one in seven in the competition. They also crashed out of the Dutch Cup here last Wednesday – their first home defeat since November 2022. The old line about London buses applied.Eindhoven was in the grip of the sights and smells of its annual carnival; the Philips Stadion pulsed to a raucous beat before kick-off.Arsenalknew they needed to master the occasion and it was so encouraging to see them start as they did – bit between their teeth, advertising possibility whenever they passed and moved.Quick GuideLille peg back Dortmund for draw to leave last-16 tie in balanceShowLille scored with their first shot on target in the 68th minute through Hakon Haraldsson (pictured) to earn a 1-1 draw at Borussia Dortmund after Karim Adeyemi gave the hosts a half-time lead in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday.The Germans, last year's beaten finalists, were frustrated with the result after failing to extend their advantage in the opening period despite several chances.They took their foot off the gas after the break to concede a deserved equaliser from the French side who waited patiently for their opportunity.Dortmund needed some time to get into the game before Adeyemi fired them into a 22nd-minute lead with an unstoppable low drive that went in off the post.Nico Schlotterbeck came close to a second goal in the 38th but his powerful shot narrowly missed the target. Pascal Gross did put the ball in the net from close range on the stroke of half-time but his effort was offside.The Germans, who have struggled in the Bundesliga this season and are in 10th place and at risk of missing out on next season's Champions League, eased off after the break.Lille, who failed to break through a solid Dortmund backline for more than an hour, finally succeeded with a quick passing move as an off-balance Haraldsson beat goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Haraldsson is only the second Icelandic player to score in the Champions League knockout rounds.Despite some late pressure, Dortmund failed to carve out any clear chances and then had midfielder Daniel Svensson taken off with a suspected knee injury after Lille's André Gomes stepped on his foot from behind.\"Tough game today and we did not show what we had set out to do,\" said Adeyemi. \"Now we have to do it at their stadium. We had wanted to keep a clean sheet and score as many as possible.\"ReutersPhotograph: Martin Meissner/APWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The strange thing was that having begun brightly, Ødegaard and Declan Rice getting into dangerous areas, Arsenal ought to have conceded for 1-0 when David Raya pushed a low cross straight to the feet of Ismael Saibari, who could only rattle the woodwork. Ryan Flamingo was off target on the rebound. Saibari had to do better.Rice created the breakthrough, spinning and standing up a cross from the left to the back post where Jurriën Timber rose to power home and Arsenal’s second was made at their Hale End Academy. It was Myles Lewis-Skelly pulling back from the left and Nwaneri’s technique took the breath away. The first-time left-footed finish exploded high into the net.View image in fullscreenEthan Nwaneri scores Arsenal’s second goal.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesThere was controversy when Lewis-Skelly, on a booking for a foul on Luuk de Jong, went in hard and late on Richard Ledezma, the PSV full-back writhing on the ground to make his team’s point – it was surely a second yellow card. The referee, Jesús Gil Manzano, who is not known in Spain for keeping his cards in his pocket, did precisely that. Arteta withdrew Lewis-Skelly not long after.

A lengthy VAR check for offside did not spare PSV.Noa Lang pulled one back from the penalty spot after Thomas Partey had checked De Jong on a corner. De Jong also headed a gilt-edged chance high before half-time.But nobody thought there was a route back into it for PSV. They were just too open, too easy to play around and through. Arsenal luxuriated in their time on the ball and they landed a one-two punch upon the second‑half restart.Nwaneri burned Tyrell Malacia for pace before crossing for Ødegaard to make it 4-1, the ball breaking kindly for him after a weak Walter Benítez parry. It was five when Riccardo Calafiori – who had come on for Lewis-Skelly – released Trossard and his dinked finish was a beauty.The chances kept coming. They contented themselves with another for Ødegaard, Benítez flapping weakly at the ball, and one for Calafiori, whose shot rolled in off the far post. You can only beat what is in front of you.

On a night that lacked a little thunder but had three superb goals – Rodrygo Goes, Julián Alvarez and Brahim Díaz all stepping inside to bend the ball beyond outstretched fingers and into the far corner – the Euro derby delivered a 2-1 victory for Real but no definitive conclusion.Atlético host the second leg with optimism still; Real go to the Metropolitano with the small advantage Carlo Ancelotti requested of his players. “We could not have expected to end it here but that gives us hope,” he said.Martin Ødegaard double leads Arsenal’s 7-1 thrashing of PSV EindhovenRead moreIt had been “very tactical”, Diego Simeone said, which was about right. He may feel frustrated that an hour’s control did not yield more, his team recovering from going behind in the fourth minute to draw level only for Díaz’s goal to beat them, his players unable to truly react a second time. He certainly did feel frustrated at how they had defended the two goals. And yet, like Ancelotti, he never expected this to be settled on the first night. Besides, if it could have been better, it might also have been worse.In the last minute, Marcos Llorente had to dive in as Kylian Mbappé should have set up Vinícius Júnior for a dramatic and painfully familiar finale. But Llorente somehow got ahead of the Brazilian then and there was still time for Vinícius to dash away again, José María Giménez flying in to block. “That could have knocked us out. Maybe that leaves the door open to hope,” Simeone said. “And now, who knows, on Wednesday we could have a great night.”It will surely be more explosive than this, a single goal standing between them, all or nothing. The first leg was, well, a first leg: a slightly cautious game, more about control than the kill, which began with two teams facing each other from distance, seemingly happy to wait and see what happens.As it turned out, they did not have to wait long. The first pass Real delivered with any intent brought the opener. Fede Valverde played it, and it was simple enough. Javi Galán had a start on Rodrygo but was slow to react and misjudged his path. The Brazilian dashed into the area, turned away from Clément Lenglet and curled home: 3min 27sec and Real led. Two minutes later, Rodrygo was escaping Galán again, going down in the area – too easily, according to the referee, Clément Turpin. Next Vinícius escaped on the other wing, forcing Giménez to block. Again, it had not taken much, but Atlético appeared overawed by it all.Quick GuideLille peg back Dortmund for draw to leave last-16 tie in balanceShowLille scored with their first shot on target in the 68th minute through Hakon Haraldsson (pictured) to earn a 1-1 draw at Borussia Dortmund after Karim Adeyemi gave the hosts a half-time lead in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday.The Germans, last year's beaten finalists, were frustrated with the result after failing to extend their advantage in the opening period despite several chances.They took their foot off the gas after the break to concede a deserved equaliser from the French side who waited patiently for their opportunity.Dortmund needed some time to get into the game before Adeyemi fired them into a 22nd-minute lead with an unstoppable low drive that went in off the post.Nico Schlotterbeck came close to a second goal in the 38th but his powerful shot narrowly missed the target.

Simeone’s call for his players to keep their heads was met; “the best thing was the reaction”, he said. Real had no central midfield; Atlético occupied it and, led by Rodrigo De Paul, began to accumulate passes. Real waited deep, passively watching De Paul and Antoine Griezmann move in front of them and, occasionally, through them, an ease to it all that brought frustrated whistles from the Bernabéu. By then, Real’s lead had gone. Alvarez collected on the left side of the area, lost it, got it back again, pushed past Eduardo Camavinga, and smashed a superb, swerving shot in off the far post.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is unable to reach a long-range curling effort from Atlético Madrid’s Julián Alarez.Photograph: Juan Medina/ReutersIn the second half Thibaut Courtois denied Griezmann with a superb save and heard the whistles return. Atlético continued to exercise a kind of unhurried control which exposed some of Real’s flaws but also their own fears: at some point, they know through bitter experience, Real awaken.

The strike was similar to the two that went before and it changed the feel here, raising the volume; this was, Simeone admitted, a different game now.Rebelling a second time was not so easy, still less once Luka Modric was introduced, someone to manage midfield. Simeone responded with Conor Gallagher and Nahuel Molina and then sent on the centre‑back Robin Le Normand for Griezmann. That might have felt like a statement of intent, a response to how the game had tilted: with a second leg to come and Real stirring now, it was more important to not concede another than to seek an equaliser. Only, it was followed soon after by the introduction strikers Ángel Correa and Alexander Sorloth, two men with a habit of scoring late goals.Real have the same ability, too, of course and although there were few really clear opportunities until the 90th minute arrived – “it’s not so simple to play against the Atlético defence”, Ancelotti said – at the very last there they were: suddenly, Mbappé and Vinícius were in, their moment arriving. But Atlético survived and Real did too, living to fight again next week, when there will be no second chances and no way back.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueReal MadridAtlético MadridEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

ForAston Villaand Tyrone Mings this was a return to the scene of the crime.It was here in November where Mings gifted Club Brugge a penalty afterinexplicably picking up the ballfrom a goal-kick, but this time his biggest intervention was an improbable goalline clearance to prevent a Hans Vanaken header from nestling in Emiliano Martínez’s net and the Belgian champions from assuming control. The cold reality is Villa toiled despite a dream start on their return to Belgium but it is hard to argue a two-goal advantage is not a significant buffer before the second leg next Wednesday.Martin Ødegaard double leads Arsenal’s 7-1 thrashing of PSV EindhovenRead moreUnai Emery acknowledged later that Mings was the good guy this time, Villa’s saviour. Twenty minutes after he somehow contorted his left boot to stop Vanaken’s header from inside the six-yard box dropping in, Villa were basking in a 3-1 victory that puts them in a commanding position to reach theChampions Leaguequarter-finals, where either Liverpool or Paris Saint‑Germain await. The Brugge defender Brandon Mechele, seemingly wary of Ollie Watkins and Marco Asensio lurking in the box, inadvertently diverted Morgan Rogers’s teasing cross past Simon Mignolet and by the end Asensio had added his fifth goal in four games, scoring a penalty after Christos Tzolis chopped down Matty Cash.Emery knew what he was getting when he signed Asensio: a three‑time Champions League winner, for starters, but also a high-pedigree star capable of bending games to his will. Just as Emery was getting hot under the collar on another awkward night in Brugge, the Villa manager booked for voicing his frustrations pitchside, a rare moment of quality snatched this game away from the hosts. Rogers’s cross was tricky and the mere presence of Asensio and Watkins spooked Mechele.View image in fullscreenMarco Asensio celebrates scoring the penalty that sealed a 3-1 win and leaves Club Brugge with a mountain to climb.Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP/Getty ImagesThe locals had not forgotten Mings’s faux pas in the league phase, when Vanaken scored the only goal from the spot. The home supporters cheered Mings’s name when the teams were read aloud before kick‑off and the Villa defender seemingly made a mental note. Only 136 seconds into this match Villa stunned the hosts to take the lead. Mings, of course, was involved. He got above the defender Joel Ordóñez to knock down a dinked Youri Tielemans free-kick and Leon Bailey arrived on to the ball like a flash, charging towards the penalty spot and stroking the ball in with his left foot on the half-volley. Mings could not resist wagging his index finger at the ardent Brugge fans behind the goal. After a freakish defeat last time, this was the fast start they craved.Villa looked primed to build but Brugge responded on 12 minutes, Maxim De Cuyper rolling in an equaliser after Tzolis drove at Axel Disasi, who started at right-back. Martínez then saved well from an unmarked Chemsdine Talbi after the half-hour mark but it was Mings who stopped Brugge from seizing the lead.“We needed our goalkeeper, we needed Tyrone’s ‘save’,” Emery said. “We can remember the match we played before here with Tyrone. This time he saved a [goal with a] really important action. The first experience he had here was not good but today he reacted fantastically. He was focused, serious – saving one action that was a goal. I know the difficulties and how we have these experiences. And we have corrected something from the last match we played here.”Emery’s quadruple substitution shortly after the hour spoke to another pale performance. Cash, Boubacar Kamara, Jacob Ramsey and Asensio entered in place of Disasi, John McGinn, Bailey and Marcus Rashford, who started off the left flank. By that point Raphael Onyedika had sent a shot billowing towards Martínez and, before that, Mings had made an early second-half intervention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pascal Gross did put the ball in the net from close range on the stroke of half-time but his effort was offside.The Germans, who have struggled in the Bundesliga this season and are in 10th place and at risk of missing out on next season's Champions League, eased off after the break.Lille, who failed to break through a solid Dortmund backline for more than an hour, finally succeeded with a quick passing move as an off-balance Haraldsson beat goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Haraldsson is only the second Icelandic player to score in the Champions League knockout rounds.Despite some late pressure, Dortmund failed to carve out any clear chances and then had midfielder Daniel Svensson taken off with a suspected knee injury after Lille's André Gomes stepped on his foot from behind.\"Tough game today and we did not show what we had set out to do,\" said Adeyemi. \"Now we have to do it at their stadium. We had wanted to keep a clean sheet and score as many as possible.\"ReutersPhotograph: Martin Meissner/APWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Asensio had four goals across his previous three appearances, the doubleagainst Cardiff last Fridaybooking Villa’s FA Cup quarter-final spot, and he almost immediately added to his tally. Brugge flew up the other end on the counterattack and went close through Vanaken, only for Mings to stagger towards the Villa goal to divert the ball’s course. A few minutes later the lively Tzolis made a mess of a chance himself from the edge of the six‑yard box after wriggling between Ezri Konsa and Cash. Brugge would be punished for their profligacy.Emery highlighted how Brugge scored three goals in Bergamo to overpower Atalanta in the playoff round but regardless Villa are in the box seat. For Villa, it is now six wins from nine Champions League matches, a fine return back at this level. “We are not in the quarter-final,” insisted Villa’s manager. “There is still 90 minutes to play and we’re ready in case we need extra time and penalties. I know how difficult each match is and how one match can change in 90 minutes. I’m sure the players have experiences of matches like that and we have always to respect our opponent.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAston VillaClub BruggeEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The lack of competitive rounds available on LIV is supposedly of concern to Koepka. Couples fuelled that suggestion when speaking toSeattle radio station KJR 93.3 FMthis week. “He wants to come back,” Couples said of Koepka. “I will say that I believe he really wants to come back and play the tour.”Trump is using the presidency to seek golf deals – hardly anyone’s paying attention | Mohamad BazziRead moreKoepka has previously suggestedthat he would not have made the LIV switch were it not for fitness concerns.In a fierce riposte on Tuesday on social media, which was later deleted, Mickelson took aim at Couples. “If it’s not true, he damaged a relationship which he cares about,” Mickelson, who joined LIV in 2022, wrote. “If it’s true he took away [sic] Brook’s control of the timeline and narrative. Either way this is a low class jerk move by Fred.”Mickelson’s approach could lead to an interesting scene at the annual Masters past champions’ dinner. Couples prevailed at Augusta in 1992, with Mickelson the Masters winner in 2004, 2006 and 2010. The pair will be in the same room on Tuesday of Masters week as usual.Speaking in Orlando on Tuesday, the PGA Tour’s commissioner Jay Monahan refused to directly address what would happen if a LIV golfer approach his organisation to seek a comeback. The PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund remain in protracted negotiations as they seek to align the men’s professional game.“I’m not going to get into any conversations that I did or didn’t have with players on LIV,” said Monahan when asked whether LIV players had been in touch regarding their options. “I’m focused on the players that are on the PGA Tour. It takes all of my energy and my team’s energy to make sure that we’re continuing to improve and strengthen the PGA Tour and doing so in the eyes of fans. Ultimately, that question is going to be answered through the conversations that we’re having with the PIF.”Explore more on these topicsPhil MickelsonGolfBrooks KoepkaUS sportsLIV Golf SeriesSaudi Arabia and sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The World Cup final in 2023 began with Pat Cummins choosing to give Australia’s bowlers the chance tochoke India’s batting. A year and a half later, in the Champions Trophy, Steve Smith as injury substitute decided that a very different Australian team should bat first.Late-career struggles or no, Virat Kohli is one-day cricket’s greatest chaser. And while a miniature tournament semi-final in Dubai is not an equal trade for a World Cup decider in a packed house at home, there will be partial catharsis for this India side beating Australia in a global tournament knockout.The target was 265, at a ground where scoring in this tournament has been modest, but after an early stutter the pursuit rarely looked a challenge in a win that felt much safer than margins of four wickets or 11 balls. Australia anticipated turn, leaving out the left‑arm quick Spencer Johnson to bring together the legspinners Tanveer Sangha and Adam Zampa, which left India’s openers wanting to lay into the remaining fast bowlers. Ben Dwarshuis and Nathan Ellis each got dispatched from their second ball of the day, while standing umpire Chris Gaffaney had to hit the deck to avoid a rifled drive.India beat Australia by four wickets: Champions Trophy cricket semi-final – liveRead moreBut Rohit Sharma was also dropped twice in the first three overs before Dwarshuis bowled Shubman Gill off an inside edge. The all-rounder Cooper Connolly was another inclusion with Matt Short injured, and his tournament debut did not start well: beaten six times in his nine balls opening the batting, a record for such a brief innings, then dropping the first Sharma chance.However, while Smith barely used Connolly during the latter’s Test debut in Galle in February, the captain turned to him here in the eighth over, with fielding restrictions still in place. Left-arm spin worked to Sharma: a leave, a block, a missed sweep, leading to a burned review and the India captain lbw for 28.But from 43 for two, Kohli and Shreyas Iyer built a perfectly judged stand of nudges and occasional picked-off boundaries.Connolly may have distracted Glenn Maxwell from a potential catch off Kohli on 51, and Iyer was bowled by Zampa moments later, but having added 91 runs the chase was under control. Axar Patel joined Kohli to put on another 44, the score 178 for four after he was bowled by Ellis attacking the stumps, then it was KL Rahul with a concerted effort to push the accelerator down and lift any pressure from his partner, scant as that was with the required rate at around five runs an over.Earlier, unforced dismissals led to Australia throwing away several chances to build on quality starts. The first instance came at 54 for one in the ninth over, then 110 for two in the 23rd, or 198 for four with 13 overs to go. At that latter point, something approaching 300 was a chance. But each time, India applied some aeronautical drag.Varun Chakravarthy has been terrific since the legspinner’s recent elevation to the one-day side, and his very first ball took out India’s tormentor, Travis Head caught down the ground for 39. Marnus Labuschagne built a partnership with Smith but missed a straight ball at his pads from Ravindra Jadeja on 29. Smith’s 73 was outstanding, punctuating defence with sporadic attack, but with a century beckoning he missed a full toss from Mohammed Shami to be bowled. Maxwell promptly did something similar against Patel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Australia were dismissed three balls short of the 50 overs and many more than three runs shy of a compelling total at 264.There was no Kohli ton in the run chase, the main man inexplicably trying to slog‑sweep Zampa for six when his own score was 84 and Rahul was blazing. But with India 40 short, he had taken them close enough. Ellis strove, conceding four runs from two overs, and Hardik Pandya had a couple of errant swings while worried about injury, but when he connected with the final two balls of Zampa’s allotted overs, the dozen runs all but finished it. He gave Ellis a second wicket slogging the bowler’s last delivery of the day, but Rahul finished the game with a six.India now have a chance for 50-over silverware, their first since their Champions Trophy tournament in 2013. Incongruously, in a tournament hosted nominally by Pakistan, the final will be played in Dubai because of India’s refusal to visit the country next door. The remaining potential opponents, New Zealand and South Africa, have no choice but to acquiesce. Australia have no choice but to head home.Explore more on these topicsICC Champions TrophyCricketIndia cricket teamAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

That plight had looked as though it would be alleviated when the club was taken over by a group led by the Swiss investment banker Dario Berta.Wigan hit the jackpot as Super League catches the eye on Las Vegas debutRead moreAt that stage Salford had been told they could field only about £1.2m worth of talent until measures were lifted, which occurred a fortnight ago when theRFLratified the takeover and was seemingly satisfied the required funding to stabilise the club was forthcoming.However, Salford’s players and staff were due to be paid last Friday and those salaries have not been received. Their playing group has now effectively stopped training in the run-up to the game against Castleford on Friday.Salford insist the delay in funding is due to a seven-figure sum coming from overseas. But the RFL has decided to take immediate action, reimposing the cap restrictions on the club. It means their head coach, Paul Rowley, will be limited once again to players worth a total of £1.2m of their £2m squad.Salford’s new administrators have been ordered to attend a meeting on Wednesday morning to explain how they plan to resolve the matter. It appears unlikely restrictions will be removed in time for the game on Friday and Salford are winless from their opening three league games.The governing body said: “The RFL special measures committee have determined at their meeting earlier today that the sustainability cap of £1.2m that was imposed on the club in February, and lifted ahead of their BetfredSuper Leagueround two fixture, will be reimposed immediately.“In addition, Salford Red Devils have been asked to update and explain to the RFL’s special measures committee and representatives from Rugby League Commercial at a meeting on Wednesday morning the current position regarding non-payment of staff, and how this will be rectified as well as a wider update on the club’s financial sustainability.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

George said he was blindsided by the England head coach but after receiving advice from his inner circle – including the Saracens director, Mark McCall, Owen Farrell, and his family – he has set his sights on a fourth World Cup, revealing the cricketer Joe Root is his inspiration.George was installed as captain for the 2023Six Nationsand despite a difficult run of results in his year in charge – England won five of their 12 Tests – he was a hugely popular leader, both within the squad and among supporters.Carling questions calibre of England coaching staff and ‘sensitive’ playersRead moreBorthwick’s decision to turn to Maro Itoje came out of the blue, with George informed the day before England’s squad for the championship was announced. Compounding matters, the 34-year-old hooker sustained a hamstring injury in Saracens’ Champions Cup match against Castres later that week, ruling him out of England’s training camp in Girona as well as theiropening defeat against Ireland in Dublin.It was during that period that George went soul-searching but, as he prepares to win his 100th England cap against Italy on Sunday, he cites the manner Root has flourished at the crease since losing the Test captaincy to Ben Stokes in 2022 as proof that deposed captains can continue to make an impact at international level.“It was really challenging, it was really difficult,” said George, who is now a vice-captain along with Ellis Genge. “That hurt, it really did and the first thing on my mind was: ‘Is that me?’ But at the same time, I have really good people around me, speaking to my old man [Ian], my wife [Katie], you understand what is important. Some of the best times of my life have been playing rugby for England, I love playing rugby for England.“It wasn’t a two-way conversation [with Steve], it was very one-way. I don’t think you can plead your case like a breakup. I wasn’t expecting it but at the same time I understood it. Steve has always been very clear with me and very honest and I have worked with coaches before who haven’t been. I really value that with Steve and the way he did it.View image in fullscreenJamie George is fully supportive of his successor, Maro Itoje.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/Reuters“I was gutted, I was disappointed, I felt like I had a lot more to give but at the same time his decision and who he has picked in Maro, is a fantastic decision.“When I was reflecting on it I took a bit of inspiration fromJoe Root. I tried to see other sports where it has happened; has it worked in any other sports, has it worked in our sport? I saw it a little bit with Chris Robshaw post-2015.“I look at Joe Root now and the freedom he has and the way he has kicked on and become the best batsman in the world arguably.“That is hugely inspiring and I see that as the sort of trajectory I aspire to be like, the way he has reacted to it I see it as a huge positive. It has freed him up and allowed him to play even better than he already was. That is how I would love it to be and I am feeling a bit of that.”George returned from injury ahead of schedule to win his 98th cap off the benchagainst France– turning in an impressive cameo with a memorable line-break – before following suitagainst Scotlandlast time out. His leadership has proved invaluable in harness with Itoje and he hopes to extend his Test career to the 2027 World Cup in Australia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That will be the case as long as I lace my boots up, I want to be helping and contributing any way I can for England.“I am ambitious. I want to be the best I possibly can be. I want to start the game but I’m not going to throw my toys out the pram and not give everything of myself if I’m on the bench. It’s easier to make an impact and be seen coming off the bench.“I play best when I’m vocal and I add to the team when I take charge of huddles and Maro wants me to be able to do that. It frees Maro up a little bit if he’s got decisions to be made with the referee, he needs vice-captains and people to take charge of other people and a different perspective.“I want to play for England as long as I can, the World Cup is definitely an ambition of mine and I would love to put my name in the hat for another Lions tour and hopefully my performances over the next couple of weeks will put my name in the conversation.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2025Joe RootSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Greens, a coalition partner in the outgoing government that led the climate and economy ministry, experienced a small slump as young voters turned to the left.View image in fullscreenA poster on a new car factory in the centre of Straßkirchen.Photograph: Ajit Niranjan/The GuardianAnalysts say it is unclear if the persistent attacks on climate policy played a role in rightwing success at the ballot box, as migration and security were the main topics on the campaign trail. But cries of ideological Green “nonsense” and an “eco-dictatorship” appear to have resonated in conservative strongholds across the country.“The [climate] orders pushed through by Berlin don’t find any support here,” said Lothar Hartmannsgruber, an optician in Straßkirchen. “People see it as invasive and patronising.”Such views are common in the electoral district of Deggendorf, home to the Plattling paper mill. The three parties that leaned hardest into attacking climate policies – the far-right AfD, the centre-right CDU/CSU, and the market-liberal FDP – won more votes here than anywhere else in Germany. Their combined vote share was almost the same in the neighbouring district of Straubing, where BMW is building the electric battery factory, at 70%.On a chilly Friday morning in Deggendorf town square, locals said high levels of tax and bureaucracy were threatening the Mittelstand – the mid-sized companies that form the backbone of the German economy.The person most responsible for this, they said, was Robert Habeck, the Green climate and economy minister who became an unpopular figure after his clean heating law was torn apart by tabloids. He has also been criticised for resisting calls to extend the lifetime of nuclear power plants.“Habeck is a failure,” said one former metalworker, who gave his last name as Hartl and said he had voted for the AfD. “Heaters now have to be ripped out, electric cars have to come in. It’s not an economy any more, it’s communism.”A healthcare worker, who gave her last name as Hoyer, said: “Habeck is a joke figure.” She said she had voted for the conservative CSU, adding: “I hope they’ll be able to drive the economy forward and stop more companies from having to move abroad.”A handful of voters defended the measures and said the Greens were in charge of the economy during a global pandemic and a war that sent the price of gas soaring – a fuel they had long argued should be replaced with renewables.They also said the overall health of the economy was a mixed bag. The Dax, the German stock market index, outperformed its competitors last year even as industrial output shrank. In Deggendorf, the unemployment rate of 3.2% is well below the national average.View image in fullscreenElection posters in Berlin.

An analysis foundnearly three-quarters of AfD voters were sceptical of more climate action. Support among CDU/CSU voters has declined from 47% in autumn 2023 to 37%.“These voters can be reached with a conservative, pro-climate narrative,” said Markus Kollberg, a political scientist at Humboldt University of Berlin who co-authored the research with the not-for-profit organisation Heimatwurzeln.“Left voters are primarily concerned with the environmental and climate-related aspects of the issue,” he said. “Voters on the right care about energy prices, energy security and its impact on economic growth.”But the election has cast doubt on how willing centre-right politicians will be to make such an argument. The Conservatives have called to overturn the clean heating law and reverse the 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars.View image in fullscreenSebastian Völkl (right) with a friend outside his restaurant in Straßkirchen, Germany.

It arrived in France in a cargo of pottery from China about 20 years ago and spread rapidly across the continent.Its main prey is honeybees. The Asian hornet can kill 50 bees a day and has devastated colonies in France and Italy.It was first seen in the UK in 2016, and there have been regular sightings since, including 44 confirmed in 2024 – largely in Kent and East Sussex.The researchers from theUniversity of Exetercarried out genetic analysis in a method called “deep sequencing” to identify prey species in the guts of more than 1,500 hornet larvae from 103 nests in Jersey, France, Spain and the UK.Rapid spread of bee-killing Asian hornets halted in UKRead moreThey identified 1,449 different prey which had been fed by adult hornets to their larvae in the nests, more than half of which (55%) could be identified as a specific species.Prey included a wide range of flies, wasps, bees, butterflies, moths and spiders, with honeybees, common wasps and blowflies most commonly found.While the hornets have a preference for honeybees, which were found in all nests and almost all samples, a wide range of other species were also recorded, showing they are “opportunistic” and prey on any creatures that are abundant in the areas near their nests.Europe’s top three crop pollinators: the honeybee, buff-tailed bumblebee and red-tailed bumblebee, were all found among the top 50 prey species identified.The study’s lead author, Siffreya Pedersen, said: “Asian hornets are known to prey on honeybees, but until now the full range of their diet hasn’t been tested. The diet varied strongly over the seasons and between regions, showing that they are highly flexible predators.She said: “Insects play vital roles in enabling ecosystems to function – including pollination, decomposition and pest control. Most insect populations are in decline due to factors such as habitat destruction and chemical pollution. The expanding area inhabited by Asian hornets poses an extra threat.”The study ispublished in the journal Science Of The Total Environment.Explore more on these topicsInvasive speciesInsectsEuropeFarmingUniversity of ExeterBeesnewsShareReuse this content"

Evans owns a one-third shareholding in the business.Evans was recorded offering access to ministers during discussions about sponsorship of the March event at which another peer, Richard Harrington, was due to speak. Lord Harrington pulled out of the event after the Guardian’s reporting.During discussions about sponsoring the event with undercover reporters posing as property developers looking to lobby the government, Evans explained how to approach Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary.

Angela Smith, the leader of the House of Lords, told the BBC that if Evans had broken the rules he should “not be a member of the house”.The decision to relocate the events to a Pall Mall private members’ club raises questions about why they were originally planned to take place on the parliamentary estate. Details of the relocation appeared in changes to Eventbrite pages made after the Guardian’s reporting.The Lords junior housing minister Sharon Taylor, who had been scheduled to speak at the June event, has pulled out. She told the Guardian she would not be attending in any capacity.Evans and his son declined to say if they had offered refunds to anyone who had already bought access on the grounds that the event would be in parliament and feature members of the House of Lords as keynote speakers.They did not answer questions about their intentions to invite ministers to future events, and did not give any reasons behind the relocation.A spokesperson for Rayner previously said she was unaware of the activities and had not been involved in any way.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsThe Lords debatenewsShareReuse this content"

Staley is trying to overturn its 2023 decision to ban him from taking senior roles in the UK’s financial sector for having allegedly misled the regulator over the depth of his relationship with the convicted sex offender Epstein.Epsteinkilled himself in August 2019while in prison and awaiting trial on charges of trafficking underage girls for sex.Staley resigned as theBarclayschief executive in November 2021 over the FCA’s investigation, and ultimately lost £18m in pay and bonuses from Barclays. He was also fined £1.8m by the regulator.The FCA has made no allegations that Staley was either involved in or witnessed the kind of conduct that led to Epstein’s arrest in 2019.Evidence presented to the upper tribunal in London showed that Epstein began emailing a man named Ian Osborne in summer 2012 with the subject heading “Project Jes”, seemingly in an effort to promote Staley’s prospects of becoming the chief executive of Barclays. Barclays was searching for a replacement for Bob Diamond,who had been forced out by the Libor fixing scandal.One of the emails sent by Ian Osborne – who ran a press relations and business development consultancy – to Epstein claimed he had access to the then chancellor, George Osborne, and hoped to influence top-level officials at the Bank of England.“Let me know how you want to proceed and I will get on it, calls can happen anytime and I can see people back in London after Tuesday,” the email said. “Rupert and George are both very close to Mervyn King and top BoE [Bank of England] staff. I am seeing the chancellor anyway next Thursday.”Previous evidence outlined by the FCA showed that Epstein and Ian Osborne also discussed contacting the Barclays deputy chair Mike Rake as part of their efforts. “I won’t do anything before hearing back from you but I’m ready to go into bat for our friend,” Ian Osborne said.Epstein responded by email, passing judgment on the rival candidates for the position of Barclays CEO, saying: “Fleming is only brokerage, tossed from Merrill, Cohn is a jerk, gs [Goldman Sachs] culture vile.”Barclaysultimately chose its own head of retail and business banking, Antony Jenkins, as chief executive in August 2012. Staley would go on to secure the role three years later in 2015.The current legal case at the upper tribunal centres on a letter that Barclays sent to the regulator in October 2019, which stated that Staley “did not have a close relationship with Mr Epstein” and that his “last contact with Mr Epstein was well before he joined Barclays in 2015”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bill will give more than 1 million low-paid workers on zero hours the right to a new contract, and an extra 30,000 parents will gain new rights to paternity leave.Few concessions to business have been made in the bill after five consultations with employers and unions, though the government confirmed it was not proceeding with any legal guarantees on the right to switch off, which had not been in the original bill.Instead, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has added a slew of extra employee protections in the latest version of the bill, including extending a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts to agency workers, guaranteeing sick pay to 1 million of the lowest-paid workers and bolstering enforcement powers against rogue employers.One union source said the trade unions had “got almost everything we asked for”.Unite, whose leadership has been deeply critical of Keir Starmer and had previously accused the government of watering down the bill, said the government had “listened and acted” to improve the bill in favour of workers.The union’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “For decades, workers’ rights have been pushed down the agenda. This is the first time in a generation that workers’ rights have been taken seriously.”The Unison general secretary, Christina McAnea, said huge improvements had been made to the bill and it was “what working people and decent employers have been waiting for”.Other amendments tabled by the government include a penalty for abuse of “fire-and-rehire” practices, which ministers hope will prevent another P&O Ferries-style scandal.Another amendment will ban employers from flooding the bargaining unit, which can unfairly influence the recognition ballot process. The GMB union had argued that when it made its first application with Amazon, 1,400 people were working at the warehouse, but the union claimed the fulfilment centre then added another 1,400 workers on temporary contracts, making it more difficult to reach the 50% target needed for statutory union recognition.The TUC’s general secretary, Paul Nowak, said that change was particularly welcome. “Corporate bullyboys like Amazon throw everything at trying to stop workers from having an independent voice at work,” he said. “This bill will help to stop this sort of egregious tactics.”The CBI’s Rain Newton-Smith said there was frustration among firms that the government’s promise to listen to business concerns about the bill had not led to any material difference. “Businesses will remain deeply concerned that this willingness to engage has not translated into meaningful change on several key areas where the legislation locks in an irreversible direction of travel,” she said.Tina McKenzie, the policy chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the government had “missed an opportunity today to intervene and help businesses cope”.Business groups won two major concessions in October when the bill was first published – a statutory probation period of up to nine months to allow for “lighter-touch” dismissals, and an allowance for zero-hours contracts to continue where employees request them.Announcing the changes, Reynolds said most businesses had nothing to fear from the changes. “Many businesses already have worker-friendly practices in place and can attest to the positive impact they have on retention, productivity and job satisfaction,” he said.Most of the bill applies to England, Scotland and Wales but not Northern Ireland, where employment law is devolved. Some clauses have different territorial extent.Explore more on these topicsTrade unionsEmployment lawWork & careersZero-hours contractsnewsShareReuse this content"

The programme was pulled from iPlayer and an internal investigation launched after it emerged that the 13-year-old who narrated the film, Abdullah al-Yazouri, was the son of the deputy minister of agriculture in the Hamas government.Speaking before MPs alongside the BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, Shah described his shock at the failings that have already emerged, which he said were made both by the independent production company and figures involved in the project at the BBC.“This is a really, really bad moment,” he said. “What has been revealed is a dagger to the heart of the BBC’s claim to be impartial and to be trustworthy, which is why I and the board are determined to ask the questions.“The processes, the editorial guidelines and the standards the BBC has are very good. They’re very strong. I have a worry that it wasn’t so much the processes were at fault, as people weren’t doing their job. That’s what we need to really establish.”Davie acknowledged there had been a “serious failing” in the documentary, but said that the BBC remained highly trusted overall. He also piled pressure on Hoyo Films, the independent production company that made the documentary, by saying BBC figures “were not told” about the boy’s possible family links toHamas.The BBC has already said it has been told by Hoyo that it paid the boy’s mother via his sister’s bank account. It described it as a limited sum. The payment is being examined part of a “deep dive” investigation now taking place into the programme.There is anger within the BBC over the failure and an expectation that there will have to be consequences. There is pressure on Joanna Carr, the head of current affairs, who had editorial responsibility for the programme and is said to have watched it before it was broadcast on 17 February. However, there are also questions being asked of the head of BBC News, Deborah Turness, an even more senior figure in the corporation.Davie was also confronted about a letter signed by figures including Gary Lineker, Ruth Negga, Juliet Stevenson andMiriam Margolyes– and now said to have about 1,000 signatories overall – calling for the BBC to reinstate the documentary, describing it as an “essential piece of journalism”.Davie said that after failures in transparency had been revealed, he simply “lost trust” in the production of the film and personally ordered it to be pulled from the BBC’s services.“It was a very difficult decision,” he said. “What I did – and it was a very tough decision – was to say, at the moment, looking people in the eye, can we trust this film in terms of how it was made, the information we’ve got? And that’s where we made the decision. It’s a simple decision in that regard.”The BBC investigation is being fast-tracked and carried out by its primary troubleshooter, the director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston. He is tasked with looking at whether editorial guidelines were broken in the production process and ultimately whether anyone should be disciplined. Hamas is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK.Hoyo Films has said it is “cooperating fully with the BBC and Peter Johnston to help understand where mistakes have been made. We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors – who have no say in the war – should have their voices heard.”Shah also revealed that the disgraced newsreader Huw Edwards had not handed back more than £200,000 in salary which he earned after being arrested for accessing indecent images of children. He was given a six-month suspended prison sentence in September. “It’s not right,” said Shah. “He’s taking licence fee-payers money. And he knew what he’d done and he should return it now.”The two BBC figures also used their appearance before the culture select committee to float a series of major changes to the corporation and its funding. Shah raised the prospect of it supporting the decriminalisation of non-payment of the licence fee in return for the government taking on the costs of the BBC World Service and free TV licences for some over-75s.Both men said that making the licence fee more progressive, which could mean the wealthy would pay more, was another option that should be explored.Explore more on these topicsBBCTelevisionTelevision industryHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

No doubt an impact on Black Londoners as well.”George, who is a critic of the police’s record on race, said: “It is deeply concerning that I am facing misconduct proceedings simply for speaking out on issues that directly impact Black officers and communities.“My role is to advocate for fairness, accountability and justice within policing. This action sends a chilling message, not just to me, but to all Black officers who raise concerns about racial disparities in policing.“It stifles free speech, undermines my ability to represent our members and reinforces the very inequalities we are fighting to address.“Policing must be open to scrutiny, not silence those who seek positive change.“This is the latest in a series of misconduct proceedings brought for engagement on X and is in stark contrast to how the [Police] Federation and senior officers are treated when they speak out.”The decision to place George under investigation was made by the force he works for, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).The discipline notice warns George that he “may have breached the PSNI code of ethics” and says it follows an allegation the force has received.The complainant alleged the tweet stirred up racial division, was biased and parts had no factual basis. They said: “Yet again I write to complain about Inspector Andy George …”“It is likely to stir up hate, division, and acrimony among officers.”The complaint that the PSNI based its investigation on continues: “It is high time this man was removed from policing as it is clear he is intent on harming relations between different races of officers, especially in the Met.”Blake was charged with murder after an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).The IOPC is now considering whether it should pursue Blake for gross misconduct, despite anger in sections of policing who view his treatment as unfair, or drop its pursuit of him.After Blake’s acquittal in three hours by a jury, seen as a sign of a weak case, it was allegedKaba was a core member of a violent gangand was suspected of a shooting.It led to pressureto make it harder to put officers on trial. A government review is expected to give – as police see it – greater protections for officers when they use force as part of their duties. Some see it as immunity for agents of the state.The PSNI, first contacted on Friday for comment, said on Tuesday that their investigation began after a “referral of complaint from the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland”, which is the police watchdog in the province.The force added: “As these proceedings are currently ongoing, we will not be making any further comment.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceMetropolitan policeRaceLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Labour has promised repeatedly to ban “exploitative zero-hours contracts”.According to the BBC, the government still has to decide whether the minimum hours offered in a contract to agency workers will be based on a 12-week reference period or longer.More than 1 million people in the UK are working on a zero-hours contract basis, in areas ranging from hospitality and warehouses to the NHS. Hundreds of thousands of them are on zero-hours contracts despite working for the same employer for years, according to theTUC.Unions have campaigned for the inclusion of agency workers in the ban, arguing that employers could get around the ban on zero-hours contracts by hiring agency workers instead. There are about 900,000 agency workers in the UK.However, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation is concerned that the change should not “undermine” the flexibility that zero-hours contracts offer some people.Big recruiters and staffing companies including Hays, Adecco and Manpower wrote to the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, saying that the new rules were “unworkable”. They said in December the rules would lead to lower levels of hiring, and more work being delayed or carried out by people taken on as self-employed.Ben Harrison,thedirector of the Work Foundation at Lancaster University, a thinktank, said:“This reform will help ensure workers – especially those aged 16-24 who are 5.9 times more likely to be on zero-hours contracts than older workers – enter a labour market where good jobs offer both security and flexibility.“At a time of record sickness levels, worker shortages and rising numbers of young people out of work or education, improving job quality is essential.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The MPs Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell had also been interviewed under caution by the police, the group said.Dozens of pro-Palestine demonstrators werearrested in central Londonon 18 January on suspicion of breaching protest conditions.

He told the crowd: “Tomorrow phase one of the ceasefire begins.

At the same time, the Trump administration was “talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, aligning with a murderous dictator”.Trudeau also rejected Trump’s repeated taunts that Canada should cede its sovereignty and join the US: “That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state.”Canada’s retaliatory response includes matching tariffs on C$155bn (US$107bn) worth of US goods. The first tranche of taxes applies to C$30bn worth of goods and the remaining C$125bn would kick in within 21 days, giving Canadian companies the chance to amend supply chains.At one point Trudeau directed his comments at US voters, saying: “We don’t want to see you hurt. But your government has chosen to do this to you. As of this morning, markets are down, and inflation is set to rise dramatically all across your country. Your government has chosen to put American jobs at risk at the thousands of workplaces that succeed because of materials from Canada or because of consumers in Canada.”He said: “Americans will lose jobs. Americans will pay more for groceries, for gas, for cars, for homes.”Addressing Trump directly, Trudeau said: “Even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.”Trump has claimed that the tariffs were a response to Canada’s failure to stop fentanyl smuggling into the US, an argument Trudeau called “completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false”. Although some drugs do cross the border, in both directions, so little fentanyl enters the US from Canada that the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) does not even mention the countryin a report from 2020.Posting on social media, Trump later raised the prospect of further escalation with a warning that any retaliatory levies by Canada would prompt further measures from the US.Trump’s aggressive tactics have prompted a groundswell of patriotism, uniting provincial leaders across the political spectrum.Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, the leader of Canada’s most economically powerful province, said his government would “make sure Americans feel pain”.Ontario leader warns of ‘pain’ for US if Trump imposes tariffs on CanadaRead moreFord, who recently won re-election on a pledge to fight US taxes, says he will impose a 25% export tax on electricity it supplies to three US states if the American tariffs on Canadian goods “persist”.Ontario also pulled all American spirits and wines from its shelves, barred US companies from bidding on procurement contracts and tore up a deal withElon Musk’s Starlink company.Ford said he felt “terrible” about Canada’s response, citing his close relationship with American governors, but said the moves were necessary to send a strong message to the White House.“The stock market will go downhill faster than the American bobsled team,” he said. “When the market drops, that’s the people speaking. Isn’t this a shame.“Every country is very, very aware that if the American government is willing to do this to their own closest neighbour, ally and friend, everyone is vulnerable to a trade war.”Depending on how long the tariffs persist – and if they increase – the effects on the Canadian economy would be catastrophic.The Quebec premier, François Legault, warned on Tuesday his province could lose up to 160,000 jobs over the next few months.“We must be able to make Mr Trump pay the price for decisions that do not make sense, even for Americans,” he said in an interview with Radio-Canada.Tim Houston, the Nova Scotia premier, called ​​Trump a “shortsighted man” who “wields his power just for the sake of it”.In a statement soon after the tariffs went into effect, Houston said it was “impossible to properly describe the uncertainty and chaos” that the trade war was causing for Canadians.In neighbouring Newfoundland and Labrador, staff at the province’s liquor stores were ordered to pull all American products.“Now, more than ever, we should be supporting local and Canadian-made products where possible,” the outgoing premier, Andrew Furey, said in the release.Alberta’s rightwing populist premier, Danielle Smith, who has previously resisted calls to cut oil exports to the US, called Trump’s action “an unjustifiable economic attack on Canadians and Albertans” and said the move was “both foolish and a failure in every regard”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpCanadaMexicoJustin TrudeauAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

This will reduce costs, reduce fragmentation, increase interoperability and strengthen our defence industrial base,” von der Leyen said.“With this equipment, member states can massively step up their support to Ukraine. So, immediate military equipment for Ukraine,” she added.The commission would also propose loosening the fiscal constraints the EU puts on government spending to “allow member states to significantly increase their defence expenditures” without triggering punishing budget deficit rules, she said.“If member states increase their defence spending by 1.5% of GDP on average, this could create fiscal space of close to €650bn over a period of four years,” von der Leyen said.

It ignited long-simmering anger in the country over corruption and the alleged lack of oversight for construction and development projects.Vučić and other government officials have oscillated between calling for talks and alleging that the demonstrators are being backed by foreign powers.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsSerbiaProtestEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station thatNasaruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty.Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.Last month, Nasa announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to 12 March. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with Nasa’s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency’s Alexander Gorbunov.Wilmore and Williams – retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers – have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.Explore more on these topicsUS newsNasaSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

Police cross-checked the notebooks with hospital records to identify potential victims – some had been unconscious and anaesthetised at the time and were told of the alleged abuse for the first time ahead of the trial.Le Scouarnec said his doctor peers had seen him as a surgeon who was “not necessarily brilliant, but not mediocre either. Average.”Asked about former colleagues who had thought he was a good surgeon, he said: “I betrayed them all. I lied to them to cover my activities, and I apologise to them for what I did. They thought that I was somebody, and in fact I’m the person who is before you now, who has committed crimes.”He said: “For most people it’s totally beyond comprehension how one can be an active surgeon, correctly carrying out one’s activity [in terms of] professional technique and at the same time commit assaults.”Despite Le Scouarnec being flagged to French authorities by the FBI in 2004 for viewing child abuse imagery on the dark web, for which he was convicted and given a four-year suspended prison sentence in France in 2005, he was never prevented from working with children and continued to gain prestigious jobs in hospitals across the country, including in Brittany and the west of France.He was never investigated during his career despite some of his colleagues sounding the alarm over suspicious behaviour. He continued to practise until his retirement in 2017, after which a rape accusation was made against him and police discovered diary accounts of abuse against his patients stored in notebooks and on computers. He is currently in jail after he was found guilty in an earlier trial in 2020 of abusing four children.Asked in court about doctors at one clinic, who found out about his 2005 conviction for possession of child abuse imagery and challenged him on it, Le Scouarnec said: “They asked me for clarifications. I, of course, lied about all the attacks I might have done and said nothing.” He said the doctors told him he should have another medical professional with him at all times when seeing patients, particularly in the emergency room. “I told them I would not resign … Because I wanted to keep my job and salary.”Le Scouarnec told the court he had a vocation to become a surgeon from a young age. Asked by a panel of judges and the state prosecutor if he had moved hospital regularly to avoid his crimes being detected or to access new patients, he said that was not his reason for changing clinic or hospital.He said his office in the hospitals always featured a cupboard with a lock and a desk with a lock. Asked by the head judge if he kept his notebooks and CD-roms of abuse imagery locked there, using the office as a “refuge for his activities”, he said he had.Earlier this week, Le Scouarnec told the court: “I feel ready to admit to some acts of rape that I have wanted to hide, deny. I’m ready to admit to them. I’m done with lying.” He described being “invaded” by fixations on abuse and called himself a “pervert”.Le Scouarnec was asked by the head judge if he had preferred to work in small clinics because he thought there may have been less oversight than in large hospitals. He said: “I always preferred to work in small structures, but not because there was less oversight. I’m not sure there was less oversight there than in bigger establishments.”He said he had mostly made post-operative visits to patients with a nurse, as was accepted practice. “Sometimes when they weren’t available, I made my visit alone, but that was exceptional,” he said.Asked by the head judge about one nurse who had said he was “the only doctor who wanted to do his rounds without a nurse”, he said: “I don’t remember that. I never asked a nurse not to do a visit with me.”The trial continues until June.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Infections kill one to three people for every 1,000 infected and can cause severe brain swelling, called encephalitis, in one in 1,000 cases. The disease also causes general misery, including a characteristic top-down rash, fever, runny nose, and red and watery eyes. The measles vaccine is97% effectiveat preventing the disease.At least 146 people have been sickened inTexas, primarily in unvaccinated communities in the South Plains region. More than 20 people have been hospitalized, and an unvaccinated school-aged child died – the first American measles death since April 2015.Kennedy’s initially muted response to the outbreak has drawn intense criticism. Kennedy erroneously said in acabinet meetingthat the outbreak killed two people in Texas, and then, “it’s not unusual” to have outbreaks. In fact, measles sickened 285 people in the entirety of 2024. The Texas outbreak alone accounts for nearly half of last year’s total relatively early in the year.Over the weekend, Kennedy then penned an opinion piece inFox Newsin which he argued vaccination was a “personal choice”, said vitamin A could “dramatically reduce measles mortality” and stopped short of explicitly recommending measles vaccination.“Good nutrition remains abest defenseagainst most chronic and infectious illnesses,” Kennedy wrote. “Vitamins A, C, and D, and foods rich in vitamins B12, C, and E should be part of a balanced diet.”Although studies have shown that vitamin A could be an effective supportive therapy for children already infected with measles,most researchhas been conducted in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa, where measles death rates and malnutrition are more common.“It could lead to the impression of a false equivalency,” Dr Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and the co-director of Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told the Post. “To make the best decision for your children, you can either vaccinate or give vitamin A … That would be highly misleading.”Kennedy’s actions also sparked outrage from Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Massachusetts senator who demanded Kennedy clarify his “intentions” for US vaccine policy in a Monday letter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the victory was short-lived. Around the same time, the former British doctor Andrew Wakefield published afraudulent studylinking vaccines to autism. The claims, despite beingwidelyandrepeatedlydebunked, have been circulated widely by groups such as Children’s Health Defense. Kennedy headed the non-profit for nearly a decade. The group is considered one of the world’sleading disseminatorsofanti-vaccine misinformation.As health secretary, Kennedy has also raised alarm forcanceling meetingsof influenza experts at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), issued astop-work orderon contracts meant to develop new vaccines, and is “re-evaluating” a$590m contractwith the vaccine-maker Moderna to develop a bird flu vaccine.The US is in the midst of the worst flu season in15 years.

New names will be found for roads and parks that reflect Uganda’s culture after the ruling, which was the culmination of a five-year campaign.In 2020, more than 5,800 people signed apetition asking MPsto “decolonise and rename” the dozens of statues and streets honouring colonialists, and last year John Ssempebwa, a human rights activist, filed a lawsuit in Kampala, claiming that roads and parks named by the British during colonial timesviolated Ugandans’ rights to dignity and freedom from cruel treatment.Apollo Makubuya, a lawyer and leading campaigner, said: “This ruling represents a significant step forward in the recognition of human dignity and the fight against colonial injustices.“It is essential to break free from the legacy of colonial exploitation, oppression, and impunity by embracing names that truly reflect Uganda’s independence and cultural identity,” he said.Kampala’s lord mayor, Erias Lukwago, said he was disappointed that the judge did not give a detailed judgment that addressed historical injustices and detailed those who opposed the British rulers, but added: “I think it’s long overdue for us to decolonise our streets.“I believe we can have our history, we can keep records, but not celebrate some crooks and historical figureheads that brutalised Ugandans. They need not be celebrated,” he said.However, Nicholas Opiyo, a human rights lawyer in Kampala, said the court order was a “futile … symbolic” exercise.“Let’s leave them the way they are, let’s see them, let it be a constant reminder of our past,” he said. “The best way to recommit ourselves to a new path is to remember that path and not re-erase it.“We cannot engage in a revisionist attempt to try to erase that history. To do so only on the names of streets would be selective. Our history is what it is. We must leave it, we must see it [and] we must remind ourselves of it if we are to move on from it,” he said.“I think the court’s judgment and process that led to it is a revisionist approach; that it’s engaged in a futile exercise or symbolic exercise to revise our history, which is inextricably linked to the British colonial role in our country.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentUgandaColonialismAfricaHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

You can’t say that about this film featuring theLondonsinger-songwriter Hak Baker. What you see is what you get with him and, like him, the documentary feels genuine and very likable. It was filmed over five years by James Topley and Ivo Beckett (working together as Deadhorses). The pair must be mates with Baker, going by the number of shots of him at his kitchen table, beer in hand, or lugging a sofa down stairs as he is evicted from yet another flat, face fixed with a smile that could raise the room temperature by at least five degrees.Baker was raised by his Jamaican mum on the Isle of Dogs (gentrification is a big issue for him). Aged 14, he joined the grime collective Bomb Squad and a few years of “parties, booze, puff and girls” followed. By 19, Baker was in prison, where he picked up a guitar and began to hone his blend of grime, folk and spoken word. The film charts it all: playing to three people in a festival field to rowdy pub gigs, Glastonbury, supporting Pete Doherty at the Royal Albert Hall.A lot of the footage looks like it’s been shot with a phone – it’s intimate and rough around the edges, but tightly edited. There’s a clip of Baker backstage at Glastonbury just about to perform; he picks up a freebie T-shirt, but then a security guard intervenes. On the voiceover Baker describes the voice in his head, always telling himself that he doesn’t deserve it. It comes from his background: “Lads thinking they’re nothing, we’re shit.” Baker’s voice is honest and sincere, his warmth unfakeable.Hakeem is in cinemas from 4 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMusic documentaryGrimeFolk musicHip-hopLondonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Novelists Dorothy Koomson and Eve Ainsworth will appear on a separate panel about persevering as a writer and overcoming rejection.Annie Garthwaite will give the keynote speech in Brighton, while Yvonne Bailey-Smith, the mother of Zadie Smith and author of The Day I Fell Off My Island, is due to speak on a panel of writers who published their debuts after 50.Other events include workshops on Toni Morrison’s Beloved, run by author Katy Massey, and one on graphic novels, led by former comics laureate Hannah Berry.De Waal, who started writing in her mid-40s and whose books include My Name Is Leon,told non-profit organisation New Writing South“festivals like Forthwrite are important because older women are all too often pigeonholed and stereotyped.“People assume we are grandmothers, we are helping out with grandchildren, we are winding down, we are gardening, we are going to tea dances and wearing elasticated trousers. We might be all of those things and there’s nothing wrong with any of them, but we are also fighters, powerful, assertive, active.“We are single and happily childless, we are blissfully unattached and having great sex, we are taking no shit and no prisoners and we are claiming back some of the power we gave away in our younger years.

How did locals feel the morning after?Alaina DemopoulosTue 4 Mar 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 12.02 ESTShareAnora’sMikey Madison mayhave won theOscarfor best actress, but the real star of Sean Baker’s madcap anti-love story was New York’s Brighton Beach.Situated on the southern shore ofBrooklyn, next to Coney Island, the tight-knit Russian and eastern European enclave retains a midcentury, pre-gentrification charm. In the film, it is the fairytale setting for Madison’s Anora, a sex worker who falls for and marries the childish son of a Russian oligarch. When the honeymoon period abruptly ends, Anora’s husband runs away and leaves her the hostage of his father’s goons – and Brighton Beach’s boardwalk begins to feel more sinister.View image in fullscreenWilliams Candy shop in Coney Island in New York. Brooklyn’s eccentric, oceanside neighborhoods of Brighton Beach and Coney Island play starring roles in Anora.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesThere would be no Anora without Brighton Beach. Baker toldCondé Nast Traveler: “It was the desire to shoot there that made this film.” He called the neighborhood “culturally rich” and “visually very exciting”.Anora’s best picture triumph owed in no small part to this neighborhood’s offbeat charm. (“Thank you Brighton Beach for lending us your beautiful backdrop and incredible community,” Madison said in her acceptancespeech.) So, on the morning after the Oscars, how did the locals feel?View image in fullscreenA copy of the Bay News featuring Mikey Madison and Peter Agrapides.Photograph: Alaina Demopoulos/The GuardianWilliams Candy shop, a confectionery featured prominently in the movie, sits next door to the Coney Island staple Nathan’s Famous. A friend of Anora’s husband works at the shop, and his father’s henchmen destroy the place when looking for him.Though Williams has been around since 1941, management welcomes the fresh PR boost from Anora. They’ve been spotlighted on local news segments, including Taxi TV, which plays in the back of cabs. Recently, a copy of a newspaper called Bay News rested on the counter, with Madison on the cover as she posed with the shop’s owner, Peter Agrapides. The publicity has helped Williams ride out the winter months, which typically see fewer customers due to the chill along the water.“I’m very happy for the store and this publicity,” said Agrapides, whose family has owned the store since 1982. But it wasn’t easy to watch an actor smash glass counters all over his shop, even if they were fake. “That was terrible,” he admitted. “They kept me far away during that scene.”Anora is now one of thelowest-grossingOscar winners of the modern era, but enough people liked it to make the journey to Brighton Beach, which is about an hour away from midtown Manhattan on the subway.At the Ocean View Cafe, another no-frills, homestyle joint where the Anora crew shot a scene, a server named Dennis Kolenkom said he had seen an increase in foot traffic since the movie’s release last fall. “They’re coming in and asking, ‘Is this the same place?’” he said.View image in fullscreen156 Brighton 11th Street, Anora’s house in the movie.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesA block away at Tatiana’s, a Russian nightclub and grill with wood paneling and a dance floor, the host gruffly shooed away this reporter. Barkertoldthe New York Times that the Anora crew filmed a pivotal scene in the restaurant’s kitchen “Candid Camera-style”: management was in on the project, unlike most of the workers and diners who unwittingly became actors in the film.At Brighton Beach’s local library, as patrons lined up for English-language classes and conversation groups, a librarian wearing an Anora T-shirt helped an elderly woman who wanted to watch the film figure out how to stream it. (The librarian declined an interview.)View image in fullscreenServers at the Ocean View Cafe.Photograph: Alaina Demopoulos/The GuardianBack on the Brighton Beach boardwalk, Victor Sergev, 37, smoked a cigarette with his afternoon coffee. He hadn’t seen Anora either but wanted to. “I like the costumes,” he said. “When I watched theOscars, I thought, ‘I want to see that.’”He added: “I think Ariana Grande [is in it].” (She’s not – that would be Wicked.)Across from Sergev and next to Tatiana’s stood an adult daycare. Elderly residents shuffled in and out, bundled up in winter coats with big fur trims. One man walked two tiny dogs wearing Christmas sweaters, and nearby two women spoke to each other animatedly in Russian. Anora may be a love letter to Brighton Beach, but the day after its historic Oscar wins, the film’s muse carried on as normal, undisturbed.Explore more on these topicsAnoraOscarsAwards and prizesMikey MadisonSean BakerNew YorkBrooklynfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the world of Vettriano, who has died aged 73, couples dress up for the beach, drive classic cars, smoke late night cigarettes and drink whisky for carnal courage.The artist defended his nostalgic vision against his many critics: “My paintings are about sex and that is not acceptable to them,” he said. “It would be OK if I painted inner-city problems and urban decay. They also don’t like me because I’m self-taught. I came in the back door and they haven’t had a chance to mould me.”The museum establishment dismissed the work, with its flatly rendered figuration, as “shopping mall art”, but the public flocked to shops to buy it, and Vettriano sold more than a million prints of his most famous painting,The Singing Butler, after it was made in 1991; and at one point he was earning half a million a year in merchandise rights for his pictures.Featuring a couple dancing in evening wear on a beach, their faces turned away from the viewer, the lovers in The Singing Butler are framed by two domestic staff holding umbrellas against the moody sky. Theoriginal fetched £744,800 at auctionin 2004.He was born Jack Hoggan in Methil, Fife, to William, a miner, and Catherine. He adopted his grandfather’s surname (adding an “a” to Vettrino) as he broke through as an artist aged 30, partly in homage to the man who first encouraged him to draw (using blank betting slips as his canvas) and partly because he thought an Italian name would suit his new profession better.View image in fullscreenBluebird at Bonneville by Jack VettrianoJack hated Kirkcaldy technical college and left aged 15, heading to the Michael colliery, though he spent most of his time “smoking and skiving”. For a decade he had a series of mundane jobs, including door-to-door sales in Darlington and working as a trainee chef for a few months inLondon. For his 21st birthday, back in Fife, a girlfriend bought him a set of watercolours and told him that “if you don’t do something with your life you’re going to live and die in this town”.In 1979 Vettriano applied for a management position in Bahrain, his first white-collar job, but one that nonetheless afforded him time to pursue his burgeoning painting practice. While out in the middle east he had his first exhibition.A year later, back inScotland, he married Gail Cormack, and took a job at his father-in-law’s newspaper distribution company; but art was now his goal and he studied and copied everything from Renaissance masterpieces to Salvador Dalí. In 1988 he submitted two works to the Royal Scottish Academy, Model in a White Slip, which featured Gail barely dressed, and Saturday Night, depicting a couple whiling the night away at the ballroom in Kirkcaldy.View image in fullscreenSweet Bird of Youth (Study), 1995, by Jack VettrianoBoth works sold on the opening night and received a positive write-up from Scotland on Sunday the next day. Buoyed by the success he applied to Edinburgh College ofArtbut was told his portfolio “failed to reach the standard required”. The snub hurt him, but he later credited it with spurring him on.Now divorced from Gail, he would visit brothels and strip bars as part of his “research”, becoming tabloid fodder as his success snowballed. “I’m not saying that I didn’t enjoy it … I’ve seen how it operates and it is quite fascinating, but it’s a fascination that is like drugs.”Whereas in his earlier work the women invariably are sexily dressed, but clothed, and often are shown leaning into an embrace or standing over the male figure, the artist’s later work was darker, more obviously erotic. In 2004Lynn Barber noted in an interview with Vettriano for the Observer: “There are two Jack Vettrianos; nice JV who goes in for butlers and ballgowns and nasty JV who goes in for sex games. And, evidently, nasty JV is winning.”One work in the 2008 series A Sinister Turn of Emotionshows a woman bent over, removing her underwear, in front of a suited man; a second painting shows another naked woman, sitting on a chair, while a man hovers behind. Vettriano rejected claims his work was misogynistic. “Take another look at it and you’ll see it’s the women who have the power,” he told the Daily Mail.In 1999, fed up with the vitriol of Scottish critics, Vettriano moved to London; and then in 2010 to Nice. “I do get caught up in worries about my place in the art world. I don’t sit at home in front of my easel thinking about where to go on holiday. What I am thinking about is what somebody said about me five years ago and it’s still bugging me,” he said.The darker subject matter coincided with the artist’s intermittent drug use. In 2011 he was caught driving over the limit and in possession of a class B drug, amphetamine, which Vettriano told police he thought was cocaine. “Cocaine just hit the spot,” he said. “It arouses your sexual appetite, but unfortunately it doesn’t give you the power to do anything about it.”In 2013 he was given a retrospective at Kelvingrove Art Gallery in Glasgow, which the Scotsman branded“a miserable, soulless show”, and in 2022 an exhibition of his earliest work was held at the Kirkcaldy Galleries. Now “clean as a whistle” – crediting two young female muses he met in a coffee shop for helping him – he became less bothered with the ill favour of the art establishment.“They don’t like an artist who is as popular as me because it takes away part of their authority,” Vettriano told the Radio Times in 2015. “I have what I want and that is the support of the public and that means far more to me than the approval of a bunch of well-educated art buffs.”He appointed OBE in 2003.Jack Vettriano (Jack Hoggan), artist, born 17 November 1951; found dead 1 March 2025Explore more on these topicsPaintingArtScotlandLondonFranceobituariesShareReuse this content"

It’sWorld Book Daythis week, which for parents and carers often means kitting out your child in a costume inspired by their favourite book. Some of you might have been preparing for weeks, but for everyone else, here are some tips for putting together a last-minute costume using items you might well already have at home.View image in fullscreenJenny McCann’s son as an electric eel from The Big Book of the Blue by Yuval Zommer.Photograph: Courtesy of Jenny McCannRe-purpose Halloween costumesIn terms of general advice, I would say it’s a good idea to look back at Halloween costumes – a skeleton outfit could be perfect for Funnybones, or a Grim Reaper could be re-purposed as a Harry Potter cape. Consider nonfiction books as well as fiction; there’s no rule that says your child has to be a well-known children’s book character (my own son was an electric eel one year!) and use cardboard and lollipop sticks to make masks that resemble illustrated characters such as Greg from Diary of a Wimpy Kid.Some easy-to-put-together ideas include Tom Gates from Liz Pichon’s beloved series: a child could wear their usual clothes but take a pencil and notepad full of comics they’ve drawn. For the titular character in Roald Dahl’s George’s Marvellous Medicine, normal clothes will work too - just add props such as a saucepan and a wooden spoon, or a bottle of water coloured blue. Julia Donaldson’s The Smeds and the Smoos could also be a relatively simple inspiration: a child simply needs to wear all blue or red – add blue or red face paint if you like.Jenny McCann, owner of Bear Bookshop, SmethwickView image in fullscreenCatherine Shoard’s son as Peter from the Secret Seven for World Book Day.Photograph: Catherine ShoardDraw on an old T-shirtGetting a nearly six-year-old into a shirt and tie is not something attempted lightly so a plain white top was sacrificed to the felt tip gods for this Peter from the Secret Seven outfit. Make-your-own-badges were invaluable, likewise a dog happy to double as Scamper. It was only later we realised how inadvertently Nazi the whole get-up is.Catherine ShoardPipe cleaners are your friendA few years back, our school thought it was being helpful by suggesting we “only” make masks for World Book Day. Cue the usual parental arms race. Child one insisted on the Lorax. But how to create that lustrous yellow facial fuzz? Pipe cleaners, of course – hundreds, looped around a pair of old specs. Did he look like the beloved Dr Seuss critter? Possibly. Could we all claim a gold star for creativity? Absolutely! My other failsafe: a pillowcase. Just about any costume can be fashioned from one of these, with the added bonus that nothing says “look, I made an effort” like a kid whose arms are awkwardly stuck out of a roughly hewn rectangle. And if all else fails? Dress them in blue and go full Andrex puppy with some loo roll.

Make tubes by rolling up each page and thread string through holes in the top of each tube (you could use a hole punch for the holes). Add a few layers and tie them together.Or base a costume on a character that wears clothes your child already has. The main character in I Love Books, an amazing picture book by Mariajo Ilustrajo, for example, wears a white T-shirt, black trousersand orange socks.Georgia Duffy, owner of Imagined Things Bookshop, HarrogateView image in fullscreenChris Disley, co-owner of The Secret Bookshelf, as Mr Bump for World Book Day 2024.Photograph: Courtesy of Jo ZebedeeLook to the pastLooking to the past can be terrific for costumes. L Frank Baum’s 1900 classic The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a great inspiration, for example. Got a school summer dress, or fabric with some gingham check? Pair with a basket and dog (real or cuddly, optional), and there’s your Dorothy. Meanwhile an upside down funnel and some carefully applied tin foil makes a matching Tin Man.Mr Men books are a great place to look for ideas, too – lots of them can be recreated very easily. A cardboard box, some red paint, and holes for arms makes you Mr Strong, a blue sweatshirt and lots of bandages and you’re Mr Bump, while pigtails, a pair of glasses and a book can transform anyone into Little Miss Busy.Jo Zebedee, co-owner ofThe Secret Bookshelf in CarrickfergusExplore more on these topicsWorld Book DayFamily filmsPrimary schoolsSchoolsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How did he escape that ‘dark, lonely’ place?Sam WollastonTue 4 Mar 2025 00.00 ESTShareIt was, says Chris Lemons, “very much a normal day at the office”. Until things went wrong. But when they went wrong, they went wrong very badly, very quickly. The “office” was actually the bottom of the North Sea, where Lemons was left without air for almost half an hour.Lemons was working as a saturation diver, living in a pressurised chamber onboard a specialised ship for stints of up to a month, and being lowered to the seabed in a diving bell to work on offshore structures. “It is a serious business, but it is routine for us. That bell going down is like the taxi to work. I always felt comfortable down there.”On 18 September 2012, Lemons, along with colleagues Duncan Allcock and Dave Yuasa, took their diving-bell “taxi” to work at a depth of 90 metres (295ft). Allcock, the most experienced of the three and something of a mentor to Lemons, was to stay in the bell while Lemons and Yuasa dropped out in their diving suits to repair a pipe on a manifold, a big yellow drilling structure used by the oil industry, about the size of a house. Saturation divers are attached to the bell with umbilicals, cables that provide them with communication, power and light, as well as a mixture of oxygen and helium to breathe, hot water to keep them warm, and a means to find their route back to the safety of the bell. “Our umbilicals are exactly what they sound like: givers of life,” says Lemons, 45, on a video call from the south of France where he now lives.The bell in turn was connected to the ship, the dive support vessel Topaz, which had a crew of 120 and was positioned 103km (64 miles) north-east of Aberdeen. The ship held its place over the dive area without an anchor, guided by a “dynamic positioning” computer system.On that day, the weather was bad – 35 knots of wind and a 5.5-metre (18ft) swell – but not unusual for the North Sea, nor prohibitive to diving. “We don’t really notice that on the bottom,” says Lemons. In fact, though it was dark, visibility wasn’t too bad. “Generally in the North Sea you can’t see much. That is half the battle, being able to orient yourself. But on that occasion, we could see the bell from where we were.”View image in fullscreen‘Very much a normal day at the office’ … Lemons and a colleague in the diving bell on board the Topaz.Photograph: Courtesy of Chris LemonsThey had been working for about an hour when things went wrong. There was an open line of communication to the ship and they heard alarms going off. Not unusual, but then came a message from the ship directly to Lemons and Yuasa: “Leave everything there – get out of the structure, boys.”They dropped off the manifold to the seabed. “That’s when the confusion started,” says Lemons. “Going up to the surface is never an option – you would die from explosive decompression pretty quickly. There is only one safe place: the diving bell.”But the diving bell, which had been 10 metres (33ft) above them, wasn’t there. The Topaz’s dynamic positioning system had failed and the ship was drifting off in the gale, pulling the bell with it. But the bell was still attached to the other end of their umbilicals, so they began to climb the cables. “I don’t remember processing what was going on. You’re just trying to get back to that safe place, climbing hand over hand, as did Dave next to me.”I thought I was going to get pulled through the structure – that’s not a nice way to goBut, suddenly, Lemons couldn’t climb any more. A loop of his umbilical had snagged on the manifold they’d been working on. The ship pulled on the bell, which pulled on the umbilical. “I immediately knew it was caught. You’ve got this 8,000-tonne vessel pulling that umbilical tight – there was nothing I could do to release it.”In fact, because the cable was caught on part of the manifold, Lemons initially found himself being pulled back into it. “I was thrashing around like a fish trying to get out of there, shouting for slack. My next thought was that if it continued to slip, there was a small gap in the structure I was going to get pulled through, like being pulled through a cheese grater. That’s not going to be a nice way to go. The first real dose of luck I had was that it stopped slipping.” It’s a testament to Lemons’s talent for understatement, and the absolutely desperate situation, that he sees this as luck.Soon, Yuasa noticed that Lemons was in trouble: “He realised there was a problem and turned to get back to me. We couldn’t speak to each other, but I remember our eyes meeting. I’m imploring him to help me, but he’s being dragged away. I lost sight of him, but I could still see his light. Then I lost sight of that.”‘Going up to the surface is never an option’ … Lemons in the bell.Photograph: Courtesy of Chris LemonsMeanwhile, the ship continued to pull on Lemons’s umbilical. He doesn’t remember hearing the cable break; it happened in stages, comms first, “like a jack being pulled from a speaker. I lost all communication, which puts you in a very lonely place. Then [I lost] the hose which provides an infinite amount of gas – suddenly I had nothing to breathe at all.”Yuasa made it back to the bell, exhausted. On the ship, they desperately tried to get the dynamic positioning system running again. Meanwhile, Lemons did what saturation divers are trained to do. “We carry these emergency supplies. You never expect to have to use them, but when you’ve suddenly got nothing to breathe it’s an instinctual thing to turn the knob on the side of the helmet to open the supply. That puts you in a very different world: the moment that you open that, you’ve moved from a place where you have this infinite supply to one where you very much have a finite one – about eight or nine minutes’ worth.”When the umbilical broke, Lemons had fallen back on to the seabed. His first task was to find the manifold, which is where a rescue attempt, if there was one, would take place. But that wasn’t easy without a light. “It was the most infinite darkness. I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. It’s easy to get disoriented at the best of times, with a compass and a light and someone telling you where to go. I knew this enormous yellow structure was probably only a couple of metres away, but I had no idea which direction. Again, I was very lucky – I bumped straight into it.”It was the most infinite darkness – I couldn’t see my hand in front of my faceHe climbed up the manifold, fearful of letting go and losing it again, and got to the top. “For some reason, I expected to see Dave on his way back to me, or the diving bell. But when I got there and looked up, there was nothing but the most absolute blackness in the sea above me.”It was cold, about 3C (37F), and Lemons had lost his hot water supply. “I would have been hypothermically cold very quickly, but I don’t have a memory of that. Maybe your body has an ability to shut out unnecessary information. Or perhaps my memory is not as good as I thought. I feel I’ve got this fairly lucid recollection of everything up to the point where I fall unconscious.”He reckons that of the eight or nine minutes of gas he had, he’d probably used four or five. “I won’t pretend I wasn’t scared and breathing hard. I realised that even if Dave had been there, the chances of him getting me back to a breathable environment before I ran out of gas were minimal. With nobody there, I decided this was probably going to be it. In a strange way, that had a calming effect; the fear, the panic drained out of me – there was nothing I could do. I assumed a sort of foetal position and was overtaken by grief. A great sadness took over at that point.”View image in fullscreenFinn Cole as Lemons, Woody Harrelson as Allcock and Simu Liu as Yuasa in Last Breath, the film based on Lemons’s accident.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyWhat was he thinking of in that moment? “I was at an exciting point in my life: early 30s, getting married the following year, we were in the process of building a house … I had all the hopes and dreams you have at that stage – of children, travel – and it felt as if all of that was about to be ripped away in this strange, lonely, ethereal place. I grew up in a middle-class family on the outskirts of Cambridge, and I remember thinking: ‘How is this dark, lonely place where I end my days?’”He also tells me he was worried what they were going to find on his mobile phone, but then says he’s joking. Lemons is very funny – that doesn’t come across in the documentary that was made about his accident.We underestimate what we’re capable of - it’s given me courage and confidenceIn the 2019 documentary Last Breath, interviews with Lemons, Yuasa, Allcock and others are interwoven with footage from the day and some reconstructed scenes. The most powerful, haunting footage is taken from a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), like a mini, unmanned submarine, which was launched from the Topaz. Lemons is lying on top of the structure, in the foetal position, and his arm is moving, twitching. Some of the ship’s crew take it to be a sign that he’s waving at the ROV, letting them know he’s still alive and they need to get a move on. Today, Lemons dismisses this. “I’m definitely unconscious at the point where the ROV finds me. We’ve got a few theories as to what that was.” To put it another way: he was not waving but drowning.He doesn’t remember the moment he lost consciousness. He thinks it was the carbon dioxide that put him under, and that’s why the “actual moment was peaceful. I feel like a bit of a charlatan. I still get contacted all the time by people who’ve lost loved ones, but I don’t have the right to tell you what it’s like – I didn’t die.”View image in fullscreen‘The actual moment was peaceful’ … Lemons lying unconscious at the bottom of the North Sea.Photograph: Courtesy of Chris LemonsSomehow, they got the dynamic positioning system going again and relocated the manifold. Allcock and Yuasa were still in the bell. Yuasa left the bell again to get Lemons, presumably expecting to bring back a body. It had been 35 minutes since his umbilical snapped, and Lemons had just eight or nine minutes of emergency gas.They dragged him back into the bell and took off his helmet. He was bright blue. Allcock gave him mouth-to-mouth, a couple of big puffs … and miraculously, he came round. Lemons doesn’t remember it, but there’s a lovely moment of footage where Yuasa reaches out and holds Lemons, who reaches out and grabs on to him and Allcock. “They’re the real heroes in this story,” Lemons says, “and everyone on the boat. I’m just a damsel in distress.”How Lemons survived – and without brain damage – for more than 25 minutes is something of a mystery. He has been to medical conferences and spoken to many experts in his search for answers, but the professionals are as perplexed as he is. He thought it was the cold that had saved him, since there are stories of people falling through ice and surviving for a long time. “But I’ve learned that if my body had been so cold that I’d gone into some kind of hibernation or stasis, there is no way Duncan would have been able to resuscitate me that quickly.”He still thinks the cold was a factor. And that, because of the pressure, his tissue was saturated with oxygen. He’s also been told that a buildup of CO2in the blood – hypercapnia – can be neurologically protective. If medical tests had been performed on him immediately after he was rescued, he might have the empirical data that could provide answers; but he had to remain locked away in a pressurised chamber after he arrived back in Aberdeen.Somehow, he was fine afterwards – physically and mentally. And three weeks, later he was saturation diving again, back on the seabed in exactly the same spot.View image in fullscreenFinn Cole, Alex Parkinson, Woody Harrelson, Duncan Allcock, Dave Yuasa, Chris Lemons and Simu Liu at the New York premiere of Last Breath.Photograph: Kristina Bumphrey/Variety/Getty ImagesLemons and his fiancee got married and finished building their house. They’re no longer together but he has a new partner, and two kids – the hopes and dreams he had weren’t lost at the bottom of the North Sea. The enormity of what he had been through took a while to sink in. It has given him a more acute awareness of mortality, and of the preciousness and fragility of life. But it’s also underlined the power of human resilience. “We sometimes underestimate what we’re capable of. It’s given me courage and confidence, rather than knocked it out of me.”Last Breath review – thrilling underwater survival dramaRead moreLemons still works in the industry, but as a diving supervisor on the ship, not on the seabed. He is also dialling down the day job and doing more public speaking. It’s funny that by knocking so loudly on death’s door, he has ended up opening a load of others.And now his story’s being told in a thriller, also called Last Breath, directed by Alex Parkinson. Allcock, from Chesterfield, is played byWoody Harrelson, from Texas. Simu Liu, who played one of the Kens in the Barbie movie, plays Yuasa. And Lemons? Finn Cole, from Peaky Blinders. “Lush head of hair, good-looking lad – makes complete sense,” says Lemons, who is – and was at the time – bald.Right, the taxi’s waiting. He’s got to go to the airport. A proper taxi, on dry land. Lemons, Allcock and Yuasa are off to New York, for the premiere of Last Breath.Last Breath is in cinemas from 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsLife and styleHow we surviveOilWoody HarrelsonDivingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But you can reinvent it.And so, in the Tuileries garden, Chiuri took an everyday basic – the white shirt – turned it on its head, and placed it front and centre in a monumental five-act show that featured mechanical pterodactyls, giant boulders, flashing lights and a lot of lace.Chiuri is no stranger to reinvention. Tuesday’s Dior show marked the first major day ofParis fashion week– the last and now largest of the “big four” by some stretch – and took place shortly after the Oscars, in which Chiuri, who is the first woman to head Dior, achieved the white whale of fashion: dressing the winner of the best actress Oscar. Not only that, she did so with another reinvention, her take on Dior’s 1956 Bal à Paris gown, which she updated in pink silk satin, for Anora’s Mikey Madison.Chiuri had no idea Madison would wear it until the night: “You send a sketch and some material and then you just have to cross your fingers,” she said. “It’s a lottery – they might not like it!”In the end, Madison wore two Dior dresses, while Sean Baker, Anora’s director, also wore a tux by Dior.The Paris collection was not only rooted in reinvention and paying homage to previous Dior designers but – as is often Chiuri’s bent – a literary figure. This time it was Virginia Woolf and her novel Orlando, a theme that has been endlessly plundered by fashion, inspiring (among others) Burberry, Fendi, Givenchy, an entire Met gala and, latterly, Harry Styles’s penchant for a gobstopper pearl.But with good reason. Woolf was fascinated by fashion. She wrote for – and was photographed by – Vogue; regularly used clothes as a plot device (notably Clarissa Dalloway and her “mermaid’s dress”); and coined the term “frock consciousness” to examine how our mood can be changed by clothes and vice versa.Fittingly for a satirical novel in which a man becomes a gender-nonconforming woman over several centuries, the collection was one of the most gender-fluid to date. Models with gamine-cropped hair wore trenchcoats and red military jackets while others with flowing hair marched out in boudoir-friendly lace gowns, leather bombers and detachable ruffles.The collection also featured a handful of now iconic bar jackets, first created in 1947 by Christian Dior as part of his “new look” collection to demonstrate a new woman emerging from the second world war. These jackets, which have round shoulders and cinched waists, have been reinterpreted by all of Dior’s creative directors but, thanks to their stretch, Chiuri’s tend to be the most wearable.Dotted among the looks were also Chiuri’s spin on John Galliano’s classic ‘“J’adore Dior” T-shirt, which he designed in the 00s before being sacked from the brand for an antisemitic rant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some came fitted with ruffles; others billowed over corsets. This item, weaponised to distraction by Meghan on Netflix this week (she prefers J Crew), suggests a return to simplicity or conservatism, or both.Fashion’s desire for basics often returns in times of crisis, though whether that crisis is global or internal is up for debate – Dior’s sales quadrupled between 2017 and 2023 but have since declined.In teeing up clothes that work for both sexes, there is every chance the Italian-born Chiuri, who has been at Dior since 2016, is responding to rumours that she will leave, and that Jonathan Anderson – the Irish designer who made avant garde fashion commercial at Loewe – will take on both men’s and women’s. If she does, then she goes out with a show that proves reinvention will always be on-trend.Explore more on these topicsParis fashion weekDiorFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

Surfers dot the water, eyes trained to the horizon, waiting for their next ride. My eight-year-old daughter glances up at the unrelenting blue sky. “Are you sure this is winter?” she asks.We’ve just arrived in Praia da Luz, a small beach town and surf spot in the westernAlgarve, where our family of four are spending February half-term with friends. It’s 18C (64F), sunny and windless. Locals are dressed in long trousers and light coats, while we have giddily stripped to our T-shirts, knowing that at home it will be months before we feel warmth like this.Lagos mapImpressed by the quality and choice of available accommodation when we booked at the last minute, we have rented a villa a 10-minute walk from the beach. It sleeps all nine of us (four adults and five kids), is set in large grounds with an outdoor pool, tennis court and a small orange grove and cost £200 a night.On our first full day, we wake to sunshine. The children, who range in age from eight to 13, race off to pick fresh oranges for breakfast, and return with juices dripping down their chins to declare them the “bestoranges we’ve ever tasted”.View image in fullscreenLucy Clarke and her family during their off-season surf trip.Photograph: Lucy ClarkeLater, we stroll down to the local beach, Praia da Luz, a long golden sandy beach backed by sea cliffs. As families who surf, we have brought our own boards, but there are also places to rent equipment and take lessons. One popular outfit isSalty Wave Surf School, which operates out of Lagos, and offers board hire and coaching for all levels. Out of season, the beaches aren’t lifeguarded, so we are vigilant as we look for rips and currents, but from Easter lifeguards will be on patrol. The youngest of the children play on the shoreline, and the rest of us take turns surfing in clean, shoulder-high waves. I enjoy the easy, forgiving beach break, while the more experienced surfers head to the eastern end of the bay to surf the reef.After a long morning in the water, we are ready for lunch and chooseLazuli, a beachfront restaurant with outdoor seating. We order cheese and ham toasties for the children, and a jug of fresh white sangria for the adults, and relax in the sun, listening to a young musician play guitar.The hike from Luz to Lagos hugs the cliff top, offering sweeping views over wild beaches below. We only see two other walkersThe following day, the wind turns on shore, the sky becomes hazy, and the surf is blown out. My son and I decide to hike along the cliff top to Lagos. We begin our walk along the cobbled beach front of Luz, then cut up steeply along a red dirt trail towards the Rocha Negra headland. Reaching the top, we are rewarded with a postcard view of Luz, with its cluster of white houses gathered by the coast.The two-hour hike hugs the cliff top all the way into the city of Lagos, offering sweeping views over the wild beaches below. We only see two other walkers, who we wish “Boa tarde” (good afternoon), eager to use the slivers of Portuguese we’ve been practising.View image in fullscreenA view from the cliff walk from Luz to Lagos.Photograph: Lucy ClarkeWhen we reach Lagos, we reward ourselves with ice-creams, and then mill along the edge of the fort, admiring a distant rainbow. In the height of summer, I’m told, the city is busy with a party feel, but in February there is only a gentle bustle. Wandering into the old town, we discover narrow, cobbled lanes and an array of attractive shops. I could happily while away an hour or two but, like most 10-year-olds, my son is a reluctant shopper.I’d promised that he could choose our dinner spot in Lagos, and he opts for an Italian eatery,Pepperino, where the chef skilfully spins pizza bases and slots them into the wood-fired oven. The staff are attentive and warm, the pizzas are delicious, and we leave happy and well fed.It is a joy to visit Portugal when the landscape is verdant and fresh, and the hillsides flecked with bright yellow wildflowersThe next day, our family visits Burgau, a sleepy fishing village a 10-minute drive west. We have a hire car, but it’s easy to grab Ubers in this part of the Algarve. A golden-sand cove is sheltered by high cliffs and, in the right conditions, waves roll into the bay. After a morning surf, we dry off and wander barefoot intoA Prateleira, a tiny, local-run cafe with views over the bay, and tuck into the local delicacy –pastel de natacustard tarts.The benefits of visiting the Algarve in low season include the lack of crowds, the quiet beaches, affordable prices and the ease of getting a table anywhere you choose. The downside is that the evenings are longer and cooler, so most nights we choose to cook at our villa. With an outdoor kitchen and barbecue, it is a sociable way to spend the evening, listening to music and having a drink, while the children (and, on one occasion, the adults) swim in the floodlit pool.View image in fullscreenThe sleepy fishing village of Burgau.Photograph: Jurgen Wackenhut/AlamyWe are gifted sunshine and smooth peeling waves for our final days. We make camp on Praia da Luz and take it in turns to surf and make ice-cream runs to the kiosk on the beachfront. A local tells us that in summer this beach is packed with umbrellas and crowds, and we feel grateful to be here out of season.As the sun goes down on our final evening, our two families are the last to leave the beach. We play ball games on the shoreline, and the children run barefoot in and out of the waves. As the sun dips behind the town, we gather up boards and wetsuits, books and towels, and make our final walk back to the villa.With climate change bringing such hot, dry summers to much of southern Europe, it is a joy to visit Portugal when the landscape is verdant and fresh, and the hillsides flecked with bright yellow wildflowers. For families like ours, who love the outdoors and prefer to avoid crowds, Portugal is a brilliant off-season destination for discovering quiet beaches, scenic walks and wonderful waves.Lucy Clarke is the bestselling author ofninenovels.

If you prefer your pudding puffed up – more of a wobble than a quiver – then I suggest baking for 40-45 minutes.Set the oven at 160C/gas mark 3. Break 2 largeeggsinto a bowl and beat until well mixed. Pour in 75ml ofmilkand 250ml ofdouble cream. Add 50g ofcaster sugar, then beat everything lightly together with a whisk. Tear or slice 150g ofpanettoneinto large pieces and place in the baking dish.Scatter 30g ofgolden sultanasand 1 tbsp ofcandied orange peelamong the panettone. Pour the custard into a 1 litre dish, soaking all of the panettone as you do so. Grate the zest of asmall orangeover the surface, then scatter with 2 tbsp ofdemerara sugar.Bake the pudding in the oven for 35 minutes or until the custard is lightly set.Serves 3-4. Ready in 1 hourTo check if the pudding is ready, shake the dish – the custard should quiver in the middle. Take it from the oven and leave it to settle for a good 15 minutes before serving.You can use brioche for this if you prefer. In which case I suggest doubling up on the dried fruit and candied peel.Follow Nigel on Instagram@NigelSlaterExplore more on these topicsFoodNigel Slater's midweek dinnerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One way to save money is to pay for only the speed you need. For most households a speed of 100Mbps is likely to be enough, although it depends on the number of people who will use the internet at the same time, the kinds of devices you use, whether you play online games and the services you require.For instance, the programmes in HD from BBC’siPlayer stream at up to 5MbpswhileNetflix requires at least 15Mbpsfor its highest-quality 4K streams. Bear in mind that any devices such as computers running updates or security cameras will take up some of the bandwidth, so add a little headroom on to your calculations.Watch out, though, for slow upload speeds, as many lower-cost packages can be hamstrung by these, and they are often overlooked when comparing deals. Zoom calls, for instance, requireup to 4Mbps uploadfor full quality just on their own while Ring cameras needup to 2Mbps each.Try your current providerView image in fullscreenUswitch is one of a myriad of comparison websites that can help you.Photograph: Sam Oaksey/AlamyMany providers raise the price of your service when your contract ends and this is where haggling can pay off.“Some providers have a reputation for being more willing to haggle to keep your business, but this can vary depending on your length of contract, previous service issues, what you want from your next deal and other factors,” says Max Beckett from the comparison site Uswitch. “Your bargaining position will be stronger near the end of your contract as you can leave for another provider, which your current one will naturally want to avoid.”Use price comparison sites to see what other deals are available and then ring or chat with your provider. Tell it you are looking for better value on your current service, say that the price it is asking is simply too much and ask what is the best deal it can offer.Be polite at all times, but don’t take the first offer at face value. Say you are thinking of quitting your contract or switching to another provider. This will lead to you being transferred to a customer retention team that typically has the power to offer the best deals to keep you from leaving.If you don’t get an acceptable deal on your first attempt you don’t have to commit there and then. Say you will have to talk it over with the other members of your household, then try again at another time or via another contact method if your provider has multiple routes, such as online chat as well as phone support or via social media. Consider upgrading or downgrading your speed, which may reduce your costs, particularly if your provider has an incentive to move customers to newer plans or technology.Note that some, including Virgin Media, are moving away from human operators offering the best deals and provide better prices via their automated online accounts instead. Check for renewal deals a couple of months ahead of time and see if they improve as the end of your contract nears.Switch the account holderIf your current provider won’t give you a better deal and there are no other options, another member of your household can take out a new contract to bag introductory deals.Simply cancel your broadband contract and have them apply for a new one at the same address. The snag is that you may have some down time. Some providers allow new connection orders at the same address once the existing subscriber has given notice to cancel their plan, switching over at the day of termination. But others only open up to new contracts at an address after the existing service has ended.Move to a new providerSwitching to another company is a good way of getting a better deal if multiple providers serve your address. TheOne Touch Switch serviceshould make sure you have a minimum of downtime between your old and new provider automatically, though it is a relatively new service which has had some teething problems.Check theBetter Internet DashboardorLocal Broadband Informationby ThinkBroadband to see which providers are likely to be available. Use comparison sites such as Uswitch, Comparethemarket, Confused or similar to see what offers are available. Check cashback sites for money back or voucher offers andother cashback services, such as those provided by credit cards.Note that comparison or cashback sites do not include local fibre providers, which may offer cheaper connections, and that big providers may also offer different deals to customers who go direct.Change to a social tariffIf you receive certain government pension, universal credit or other benefits you may be entitled to a social tariff, which is a lower cost plan made available by some providers from as little as £12 a month.BT,Now,Sky,VirginandVodafoneoffer social tariffs nationally, with varying eligibility requirements and speeds available. Some local providers,such as Hyperoptic, also offer social tariffs so it is worth looking around for the best speed and deals.Bundle with phone, mobile and TVIf you also have a home phone, mobile phone, pay-TV or other services, bundling them with your broadband can work out much cheaper than paying for them all separately. It simplifies your various connections to one bill and can offer faster speeds for less money than broadband on its own.But bundling removes some of the flexibility for switching should you ever want to, and narrows your options to the main providers. Be careful that you don’t end up taking out more services than you need through upselling.Or hang up the landlineView image in fullscreenBuying internet without a home phone can save you as much as £30 a year in line rental.Photograph: Tony Dunn/AlamyModern broadband does not need a phone line any more, so if you no longer use your home phone then buying internet without it can save you as much as £30 a year in line rental plus the cost of your calling plan depending on your current package.Use your own routerSome broadband packages include a charge for a wifi router system, particularly those that promise “whole-home wifi” or similar, with multiple wifi nodes that mesh together to spread your internet over a larger area.Buying your own wifi system can work out cheaper than paying for one from your service provider over the long term. Mesh systems capable of covering most homes start at about £100 and can replace or be plugged into your existing router easily. You may also get better coverage and faster wifi speeds.Switch to 5G/satelliteIf your fixed-line providers are limited, expensive or slow,5Gor satellite broadband might offer an alternative.Broadband over 5G is delivered using the same signal as your phone, but using a router inside your house. It is only available in certain areas and requires strong signal to work reliably, but EE, Three and Vodafone all offer the service, with the cheapest plans starting at £21 a month.Multiplesatellite broadbandproviders operate in the UK, offering fast services to places others can’t reach. Brdy has some of the cheapest plans starting at £29.90 a month while Starlink starts at £75. Both providers can have fairly hefty setup or equipment costs, depending on the plan. Speeds can reach up to 200Mbps, but satellite broadband has higher latency than fixed-line – that is, it takes longer for it to respond – and so may not be suitable for online gaming and similar usage.Explore more on these topicsBroadbandMoney hacksInternetConsumer affairsHousehold bills5GTelecomsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The hatching process began the day before with the first visible pip, which is a crack in the eggshell.The first crack was followed by a second pip by Monday morning. Thousands of viewers tuned into thenest’s live webcam, operated by the non-profit Friends of Big Bear Valley, and saw how Jackie was on her toes, rolling the eggs from time to time.“Shadow happily got a turn on the eggs to give Jackie a morning break,” reads anupdatepublished on Tuesday from the non-profit.Shadow attempted several times to take over incubation, but Jackie was too invested to leave. By mid-morning, the pair of bald eagles heard tiny chirps and the chicks’ beaks were visible through the cracks.As the day progressed, Jackie brought a fish in preparation for feeding. By nightfall, the first chick fully emerged at 11.26pm on Monday.“By the wee hours this morning, Chick #1 had become a fluffy fuzz ball as it’s downy covering dried into a soft gray coat,” reads a Tuesdayupdateby the non-profit.On Tuesday morning, a second chick was brought into the world. The chick began the final stage of hatching, known as “zippering,” using its egg tooth to crack a straight line around the shell while pushing with its feet.About an hour later, its small wing peeked out, and at 4.29am, the second chick fully emerged.“Soon after, Shadow called from a distance and Jackie seemed to be happily announcing that he was now Papa to 2 new fluffy chicks,” reads the update from Friends of Big Bear Valley.The third egg is still within the expected hatching timeframe as it marks day 35 of its journey coming into the world.‘I couldn’t admit I was afraid’: biologist Tina Morris on her fight to save the bald eagleRead moreThe nest’s live webcam captures the unaware adult eagles as they continue sharing incubation duties, catching the birds in their highs and their lows. In 2023, ravens devoured Jackie and Shadow’s eggs, with luckily no hatchlings inside yet.The compelling journeys of the pair of breeding raptors, streamed live on YouTube and Facebook from California, have drawn inhundreds of thousands of viewerssince the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.Bald eagles live up to 30 years in the wild,according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and conservation efforts have seen the species recover strongly from the brink of extinction 40 years ago. The service’smost recent reportestimates that numbers have quadrupled since 2009, to 316,700 birds, including 71,400 nesting pairs.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWildlifeWest CoastShareReuse this content"

In 2022 she began selling her creations. At the time she told Fashion Journal: “I’m not too sure if I consider what I’m doing as a commercially viable label at this point.” A year later she officially founded her label. “But really, I’ve been making non-stop for the last 10 years,” she said. “This feels like the culmination of a lot of hard work.”View image in fullscreenLawrence with her award.Photograph: Dan CastanoLawrence still sews and hand-finishes every piece in her Melbourne home studio, drafting patterns on the living room table and sewing dresses in the front room. Each garment is made to order, with customers waiting approximately six weeks for their purchase to arrive. “There’s something lovely about someone placing an order and me making a dress just for them,” she said.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningUsing mostly undyed silks, all of Lawrence’s designs feature seams sewn with an embroidery technique called a fagoting stitch, which creates a small, decorative gap between each piece of fabric in a garment. She taught herself this stitch style by reading early 20th century home dressmaking manuals.View image in fullscreenLawrence’s designs feature complex pleating and hand-sewn details.Photograph: Dan CastanoCaroline Ralphsmith, the chief executive of Melbourne fashion festival and co-judge of the award, praised Lawrence’s ultra-slow approach to fashion. She said judges had some concern about the designer’s ability to commercialise her work, “but that paled in comparison to everything else”.“She is so extraordinary in terms of the craft she brings to her work,” Ralphsmith said. “The handiwork is just mind-blowing … and they look amazing on.”Heart and sole: the Salvadorian shoemaker catering to Melbourne’s well-heeledRead morePart of Melbourne fashion festival, the National Design award is open to emerging designers within the first five years of their business. Winners receive a business development package, including a cash prize of $20,000. Lawrence said her prize money would probably go towards working with a local factory to create small production runs of her designs, which she hopes to sell wholesale.The Melbourne designer Saskia Baur-Schmid of Hyph-n, a label focused on zero-waste pattern cutting which manufactures in Ballarat, received an honourable mention for sustainability, with a cash prize of $10,000.Both 2024’s and 2023’s design award winners – the canvas bag brand Haulier and the sweater brand Best Jumpers – have a highly commercial approach to fashion. Ralphsmith said the choice to award a designer whose work is more artful than marketable was not “entirely an accident”. This year the judging criteria was more heavily weighted towards innovation and creativity, she said.Lawrence is the first designer in 29 years to receive her award in public. Previously, the award ceremony was an industry-only event. For 2025 Melbourne fashion festival hosted a consumer-facing runway show featuring the award’s 10 finalists, in front of a sell-out crowd of 1,500 on Tuesday night.In addition to working on her own label, Lawrence spent close to five years working first as an intern then later as a production coordinator for Maticevski. That label’s designer, Toni Maticevski, won the National Designer award (then called the New Designer award), in 2002. “That is beautiful, isn’t it?” Ralphsmith said of this connection. “They’re both beautiful makers.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian fashionSewingAustralian lifestyleShareReuse this content"

While her feminist stances have made her a divisive figure among some, her simple to digest style and insistence on writing about everyday experiences have won her fans.“She made it OK to explore our inner lives, even if we were ‘ordinary’,” says Saratu Abiola, a writer and policy strategist in Abuja. “She really elevated relatability.”Power agrees. “In many ways, Chimamanda gave me permission to be ordinary and to be comfortable, and to be strong and to be solid in my ordinariness. Even for something like natural hair that people might consider trivial,” she says.She helped shift expectations so that the next wave of African writers didn’t have to over-explain, dilute or justify their storiesAinehi Edoro, Brittle Paper“To be able to live in this world and know that somebody as powerful as Chimamanda is fine with travelling and doing all these great things that she does and still looks gorgeous does something for young girls and women alike.”The publishing industry was also influenced by Adichie’s style, says Ainehi Edoro, founder of literary blogBrittle Paperand associate professor of English at University of Wisconsin-Madison.View image in fullscreenYoung women follow the author’s Instagram account for style tips, and to pepper her with playful questions about her characters.Photograph: Instagram/Chimamanda_Adichie“Before her, African fiction often came packaged with a kind of ethnographic weight – expected to ‘explain’Africato a western audience,” she says. “But Adichie’s work wasn’t performing ‘Africanness’ for an outsider’s gaze; it was literary, intimate, contemporary. She helped shift expectations – both in publishing and among readers – so that the next wave of African writers didn’t have to over-explain, dilute or justify their stories.”After her first two novels, Adichie became well-known in literary circles but it was a Beyoncé collaboration in 2013, the same year thatAmericanahwas released, that saw her influence grow exponentially and elevated her to rock star status.“I’d say she transcended being a literary favourite when sheteamed up with Beyoncé on Flawlessand started to occupy more mainstream stages,” says Abiola, who has compared the roll out and anticipation for Dream Count to that of “a big music artist’s upcoming album”. “Nothing we love more than seeing a fellow Nigerian in the lights.”In 2022, Adichie privately declined a national honour from the government, according to her spokesperson, but her home town conferred on her the chieftaincy title of Odeluwa – Igbo for “the one who writes for the world”.Diehard fans began substituting their English first names with their Nigerian ones, including Power, who dropped Doris for Uzoamaka after a chat with Adichie at the end of the 2015 workshop.Young women began following her Instagram for style tips and became cheerleaders for what they called her “rich aunty” style, while playfully leaving comments on her posts like: “What happened to Kainene?”, a reference to theHalf of a Yellow Suncharacter who does not return home at the end of the Biafran war.Isioma Onyegikei, author ofthe novel Aegis, sees Adichie as a bridge between older and contemporary African literary excellence. She says people have taken to Adichie because she is visible enough for many to feel “like they are able to touch her”.“I read Flora Nwapa and Buchi Emecheta growing up but somehow they felt like an imagination,” says Onyegikei.“It’s different with Chimamanda,” she adds. “I watch her videos, see her … share her pain of loss and it feels very relatable because she’s succeeding, she’s in her prime, using the same apps that we use and it almost feels like I can touch her and be the same person one day.”On X, young feminists banded together after Americanah came out, holding conversations on gender-based violence, traditional gender roles, natural hair and equal opportunities for women – or the lack of – in the workplace, while calling her “my president” and “our leader”. The debates stirred the platform so much that the term Daughters of Chimamanda emerged first as a descriptor, then as a slur, for Nigeria’s feminists.‘I was told books don’t sell here. I knew that wasn’t true’: the English teacher shaking up Nigeria’s publishing sceneRead morePerceptions of her began to change on social media after her stance on transgender peopletriggered worldwide debatein 2017. Adichie has argued – and continues to do so – that the experiences of people who previously lived as men and were accorded male societal privileges before transitioning to be women, are significantly different from those of people who were born female.Another comment, in a 2021 video – “I often say to young Nigerian feminists, please do not use feminism to justify your wickedness” – displeased some of her Nigerian fan base, partly because some said it had been weaponised on X.Nevertheless, her literary icon status holds fast and many of her readers see her as a multidimensional figure, much like a character in one of her books.“Chimamanda is very interesting,” said Onyegikei. “Many of the people – particularly guys – who hated her guts for her stance on feminism now stan [admire] her for her stance on transwomen. The people who stanned her then for her views on feminism can’t stand her because of transwomen. All in all, love or hate her, you must respect her.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentChimamanda Ngozi AdichieFictionNigeriaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

In this week’s Techscape: the cost of Elon Musk’s cost-cutting, the emotional shutdown of Skype, and a new documentary on immigration and surveillance.Elon Musk’s cost savings will be very expensive for the USOn Saturday, Elon Musk took aim at his next target in the federal government: the technology division of the General Services Administration (GSA), which the Guardian was among the firstto report.The GSA, according to itswebsite, “manages federal property and provides contracting options for government agencies”. Its tech division was known as 18F – and was made up of some 90 employees, many of them software engineers dedicated to streamlining the federal bureaucracy (a task that doesn’t sound too far off what Musk has claimed he’s trying to do with Doge).You may not know about 18F, but have likely heard of its most famous product: free tax-filing software. The sub-agency created IRS Direct File, a program that aimed to resolve one of the most frustrating and relatable examples of the excesses of bureaucracy: having to fork over cash to be able to give the government money.Still, Musk wasn’t a fan. He tweeted a few weeks ago that he had “deleted” IRS Direct File, though it remained available up until now. The fate of the software is not clear. Because of Musk’s work with Doge, more people in the US are now likely to spend money that they would not have had to spend before he arrived in Washington. His efficiency efforts will personally cost American taxpayers.It’s just one of myriad ways that Americans will end up footing a bill for Musk’s so-called cost-saving.My colleagueMichael Sainatoreports:Donald Trump’s administration could rack up a “monumental” bill and is breaking the law by firing government workers on spurious grounds, according to a top labor lawyer.Officials have cited “poor performance” when terminating thousands of federal workers. In many cases it’s not true, according to employees embroiled in the blitz, many of whom are now seeking legal advice.Suzanne Summerlin, a labor attorney, summed things up: “These firings they’re conducting without following the law will result in hundreds of thousands of former federal employees being owed back pay, plus interest, plus benefits, plus attorney fees,” she said. “When the bill comes it will be monumental.”Read the full story.It’s a deja vu in Muskworld. After Musk acquired Twitter and fired the majority of its employees and its entire executive slate, he let both groups claim their severance in court if they so pleased. They sued.Bloomberg reports that Musk has lost all his battles over severance with former Twitter employees so far: “Four ex-Twitter workers have prevailed in a recent series of closed-door arbitration proceedings over claims they were illegally denied severance, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg News.“Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer representing former employees in arbitrations, wrote in the memo that the 20 cases she’s won so far have cost the company at least twice the amount of contested severance pay because the awards have also included interest, arbitration expenses and legal fees. She’s representing more than 2,000 former employees in legal fights against Musk.”Read the full story.More on Musk …‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Elon Musk’s fascist-style salutesTrump cabinet flunkies hail wannabe Caesar and Elon, his oligarch palShare your memories of SkypeView image in fullscreenThe Skype app logo.Photograph: Sheldon Cooper/Sopa/LightRocket via Getty ImagesMicrosoftannounced on Friday that it would shutter Skype.

But many of the tools and tactics the administration is using have been used by every administration since at least 2004.A new timely documentary shot over the course of the first Trump administration, calledBorderland: The Line Within, brings some clarity to the ways the “border industrial complex” was being weaponized in Trump’s first term as president and how it affected asylum seekers and immigrants working in the system. Specifically, the documentary, directed by Pamela Yates and Paco de Onis of Skylight Pictures, follows the journey of immigrants turned activists Kaxh Mura’l and Gabriella Castañeda.Mura’l is an Indigenous Maya who left Guatemala, where he was an environmental land defender, and Castaneda is a mother who lost her Daca status during the Covid pandemic. When Mura’l was released after months of detention, he was obligated to wear an ankle monitor operated by a private company called BI Inc,which the Guardian has reported on extensively. He said even though he was no longer detained, he was still not free.The documentary focused on the companies and corporations profiting from the surveillance of immigrants in the US. A group of data scientists, who worked at Columbia at the time, looked at the many billions of dollars awarded to corporations by the Department of Homeland Security, whether for privately run detention centers or the ankle monitor system. The film got across a point we try to make in much of our reporting: There is an entire industry vying for extremely lucrative contracts to enable the US government to track, detain and deport immigrants. Just this week, the largest private contractor for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it isplanning for a surveillance boomas Trump’s migrant crackdown continues.In a Q&A with the Guardian staff, Yates said she believes the cruelty of the system is part of the point because it creates an environment of fear that might discourage immigrants from fighting for their rights. “People who are undocumented in the US have that fear inside of themselves … that they can be captured and deported,” Yates said. “And I think the cruelty amps that fear up.”The wider TechScapeUS national security director condemns UK request for Apple data ‘backdoor’UK watchdog to investigate TikTok and Reddit over use of children’s dataTrump administration retreats in fight against Russian cyber threatsApple shareholders vote against ending DEI program amid Trump crackdown‘I want him to be prepared’: why parents are teaching their gen Alpha kids to use AIGhost hunting, pornography and interactive art: the weird afterlife of Xbox KinectExplore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterElon MuskSkypeTelecomsSurveillancenewslettersShareReuse this content"

These highly nutritious Amazonian superfoods are rich in antioxidants and vitamins, and serve as a main source of income for farmers in Silva’s area. However, the lack of electricity to refrigerate the fruit makes it hard to sell their produce.Silva’s fruit-growing operation is located in the village of Boa Frente, in Novo Aripuanã municipality, one ofBrazil’s most energy-poor regions, where there is only one diesel-powered electricity generator working for a few hours a day.The 17 families in the community pay for the diesel, but because of the high price, everyone agrees to use the generator only between 6pm and 10pm. This is also the only time they can communicate with the outside world – the region has no mobile phone connection, only satellite internet.“Power is supplied for just four hours a night. The motor is switched off and only switched back on the following night,” says Silva, 72, a rural health worker and fruit-grower who has lived in the area since he was born.“I would have a much higher income if we had power to preserve the cupuaçu pulp. Our community is a big producer of tucumã, but the lack of power prevents conservation.”More than 1.3 million Brazilians still live, like Silva, with little or no electricity. Even though it has one of theworld’s cleanest power grids, the country has a vulnerability: its reliance on hydroelectric power, which causes fluctuations in power generation and blackouts in times of severe drought.View image in fullscreenBrazil has one of the cleanest energy grids in the world, but is heavily reliant on hydropower, which can lead to blackouts in drought conditions.Photograph: Jeff BotegaYet Brazil is attracting the attention of big datacentre companies, which consume huge amounts of energy. According to theBrazilian Data Centre Association(ABDC), 46 new datacentres are either under construction or being planned across the country. There are already 60 centres in operation.By using cooling systems with excessive water use, these companies consume more than small citiesVinícius OliveiraThe rush to build datacentres is part of the growing digitalisation of the Brazilian economy as large multinationals seek more data storage and processing for cloud platforms, apps, and critical private and government services.Brazil has become a hub to meet growing demand in Latin America for streaming, e-commerce and AI apps, as expanding regional server capacity is critical to minimising delays in transferring data.“If all the data was stored solely in the US, communication would be inefficient and delayed,” says João Xavier, director of institutional relations at ABDC.Rodrigo Pastl Pontes, monitoring manager at Brazil’sNational Confederation of Industry, says the need to expand the number of datacentres is closely related to “Industry 4.0” – the integration of technologies to make manufacturing more intelligent, automated and interconnected.View image in fullscreenAn impression of Scala Data Centers’ planned 700-hectare AI City in Rio Grande do Sul. ‘This is our response to the demand for artificial intelligence,’ the firm said.Illustration: Scala Data Centers“Industry 4.0 offers flexibility that meets customer requirements in real time, allowing the company to reorganise constantly,” says Pontes. “Securedatacentres are essential for this.”One studyput Brazil’s Industry 4.0 market at $1.77bn(£1.40bn) in 2022 and expects it to reach $5.6bn by 2028.With an eye on local and global markets, as well as its largely renewable power grid, Amazon andMicrosofthave announced new investments in Brazilian datacentres.Amazon plans to invest 10.1bn reais(£1.35bn) in expanding its datacentres and infrastructure over the next 10 years. The company claims to have established solar and windfarm projects with the capacity to match its energy consumption in Brazil – enough to supply 100,000 homes.View image in fullscreenItaipu hydroelectric dam in Foz do Iguaçu. Though Brazil has vast hydropower potential, recent droughts have underlined its vulnerability to the climate crisis.Photograph: Bloomberg/GettyMicrosoft is planning to invest R$14.7bn in the country. With datacentres in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the company has signed a deal with the energy company AES Brasil to be supplied for 15 years from a Rio Grande do Norte windfarm.Campaigners and experts say the problem is that implementing new energy projects, even renewable ones, could harm local communities just as the country needs to adapt its power grid to the climate crisis.Vinícius Oliveira, a specialist at theEnergy and Environment Institute, says: “The impact of datacentres depends on where they are installed and on the type of energy the Brazilian power grid will need to meet the load demanded.“We may have environmental impacts in soil, deforestation, building road access. Native flora will be eliminated. We may have real-estate speculation, with land becoming more expensive and families being displaced.” Oliveira also anticipates greater demand for water, as datacentres generally require vast amounts to cool servers.View image in fullscreenOsório windfarm in Rio Grande do Sul. Demand for power is rising so fast that small nuclear reactors are now being considered.Photograph: Alamy“By using cooling systems with excessive water use, these companies consume more than small cities,” he says, stressing that better infrastructure for distribution and power generation will also be required.“This level of investment may affect energy rates,” he adds. “In the end, the consumers bear the cost.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Projections suggestBrazil’s electricity demand will grow by more than 30% by 2050.Experts fear that datacentres’ high water consumption will raise pressure on the power grid, as hydroelectric plants supply about half of all power. Lower water levels in reservoirs raise the chances of blackouts and increase demand for pricier and more pollutingthermal power plants, fired by oil, gas and coal.Incidents such as the 2001 water crisis, which caused rationing, and the severe 2014-15 drought, when reservoirs reached record lows, show how a lack of rainfall can threaten the national power supply.View image in fullscreenItajá in Goiás during a blackout last year.

This has prompted greater interest in alternative energy sources such as small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), as seen in theplan by Alphabet, Google’s parent company, to use them in the US.According to Raul Lycurgo, president ofthe state-owned company Eletronuclear, nuclear power can meet Brazil’s needs. “Nuclear is the only [power source] that does not generate greenhouse gases,” he says.But the idea faces opposition due to high capital costs and concerns about how to manage radioactive waste. “Countries with no alternatives can afford to use a more expensive energy,” says Ricardo Lima, an energy consultant. “We have much cheaper alternatives than nuclear – we have solar, wind, hydroelectric.”Energy has been an issue as theclimate crisis increasingly tests the Brazilian power grid.

Elaine Santos, a researcher in energy poverty at the University of São Paulo, faces the problem herself, as she lives in Santo André, a suburb of the city.“People lose food and their medication; the bakery closes,” she says of the power cuts. “The shortages create tension, as everyone knows they will have to cope with their losses alone in neighbourhoods where people live in extremely vulnerable conditions.”Santos believes the tech companies must look at the local effects caused by their growing share of the country’s power supply.“If they are going to build datacentres where people don’t even have access to power, the companies need to provide compensation,” she argues. “Since Brazil is being sold, the compensation must be robust.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanInternetEnergy efficiencyAccess to energyEnergyAmazonMicrosoftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If we lose it, we lose one of our last windows into the universe, and Chile will lose its astronomical leadership, and the hundreds of millions of euros invested here. It will become a mediocre site and we will have to look elsewhere for future projects.”A 60-day public consultation process for the Inna project ends on 3 April.AES Chile could not be reached for comment, but a press release from December claimed that the company was committed to the “highest environmental standards”, and that its project aligned with Chile’s green hydrogen goals.“How can we compare the short-termism of an industry which will create jobs and local economic development with this long-term goal of studying and understanding the universe?” asked astronomer Eduardo Unda-Sanzana, who is leading a crusade to protect the skies of northern Chile from the University of Antofagasta.“It’s a false equivalence: human beings and the knowledge they pursue are worth considerably more than the money that ends up in their pockets each month.”Chile has pioneering light pollution regulation as part of its environmental norms, setting limits on light emissions in certain areas and promoting dark skies as a basic right.“It is nonsense to me that with 6,400km of coastline in Chile, they have to put this facility so close to the biggest telescope in the world,” said Dr Falchi.“We need to face the problem of light pollution in the same way we tackled atmospheric pollutants, where we had huge success putting red lines in place which should not be passed.“We need to do this in order to save the night sky in the long term.”This article was amended on 4 March 2025.

Illustration: Chester Holme/The GuardianUnder Arnolds Field, tonnes of illegally dumped waste have been burning for years, spewing pollution over the area. Locals fear for their health – and despair that no one seems willing to helpByWilliam RalstonTue 4 Mar 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 08.53 ESTShareOne afternoon in July 2011, an 11-year-old boy named William Knowlden was out cycling with friends when he came upon Arnolds Field, an expanse of green land in Havering, east London. The site spans about 17 hectares, or 24 football pitches, and around its perimeter runs a wooden fence, with two access points through which vehicles can pass. Arnolds Field rises much higher than the surrounding land. Its surface is lumpy and undulating, like a blanket thrown over a heap of cuddly toys. The land is overgrown. It has been decades since animals grazed there, and few people have set foot on it in recent years. But every so often, it is mistaken for a safe place to explore.As Knowlden descended a hill, he lost control and was thrown over the handlebars. When he came to, he was lying in a small crater and his feet were covered in a powdery residue that resembled ash. He felt a sharp pain in his left foot. When Knowlden’s friends arrived, they removed his shoes and peeled back his socks. One foot was pink and swollen, the skin blistered and shiny; the other was blackened and charred. Patches of skin hung off, revealing layers of fatty tissue. “It looked like it had been eaten by maggots,” Knowlden recalled. “Like pure, pure flesh.” In hospital, doctors informed Knowlden that he’d suffered third-degree burns in his right foot. They were baffled. With thermal burns, there should be an identifiable source of heat, like an open flame, but Knowlden and his friends hadn’t seen anything like that.In the years following William’s accident, his mother, Nicola, became fearful that there might be something seriously wrong with Arnolds Field. Smoke would occasionally rise up from it, and a strange smell, like burning plastic or rubber, would engulf the neighbourhood. “I was like, ‘Oh my God. What on earth is over there?’” she told me. She wasn’t alone. Around 2014, fishers at a lake next to Arnolds Field became suspicious when the fish started mysteriously dying off. One local woman, Barbara Thwaites, told me that around this time, she had started to have respiratory problems. When her husband suffered severe respiratory collapse and died, she grew even more suspicious. “I knew something was going on there, but I didn’t know what,” she told me. After her son’s accident, Nicola Knowlden says she wrote an email to the council, urging them to investigate, but never heard back. (Havering council says it has no record of this email.)Nobody knows exactly what lies under Arnolds Field, though there are rumours: ammunition from a nearby former airfield, animal carcasses from the foot and mouth outbreak, hazardous waste from the London Olympic site. Like all waste, whatever is under Arnolds Field generates heat as the organic materials decompose. Fires have been burning underneath the site for years – in 2023, a thermal imaging drone identified a patch of ground that was 176.4C – while surface-level fires have become more common and more violent. Since 2018, the fire brigade has attended nearly 200 fires at the site. “When it comes to May and the phone rings, everyone rolls their eyes because we know it’s Arnolds Field,” Paul McClenaghan, borough commander for Havering for the London Fire Brigade, told me.The worst fires last for days, spewing huge plumes of smoke that engulf the area. Rainham, one of the most deprived suburbs of London, lies 500 metres to the north-west of Arnolds Field. “There are days when I feel like someone is sitting on my chest, like I can’t get a full lung full of air,” Coral Jeffery, one 78-year-old resident, says. Each new fire stokes local people’s fears that they are being exposed to harmful pollution. Between 2006 and 2017, rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a severe lung condition, have been rising faster in Rainham than in other parts of the capital, according to an analysis conducted by an academic at University College London in 2022. Knowlden, who is now 22, fears the worst fires are to come, which is why he’s saving up money to move away. “One day it’s going to go up and they aren’t going to be able to control it,” he told me.One group of volunteers,Rainham Against Pollution, has approached the European court of human rights for support in pressuring Havering council to clean up the land. Yet the council argues that because the land is private, it is the owner’s responsibility to address the problem. A second campaigning group is mounting a legal challenge to the council’s decision not to formally designate the land as “contaminated”. Margaret Mullane, who was elected the new MP for Dagenham and Rainham in July 2024, has vowed to stop the fires once and for all. “Launders Lane has been a public health threat to Rainham residents for too many years,” she told me. But a solution seems a long way off.In spring 2024, I met the members of Rainham AgainstPollution. As we drank beers in a run-down pub near the train station, an acrid bonfire smell hung in the air, and the season’s fires were only just beginning. “There is no regard whatsoever for a single person who lives in this area,” Mark James, the group’s leader, told me. “It’s like living with a volcano,” said Sue Ospreay, Havering’s 63-year-old deputy mayor. “It erupts and then you have two, three, four days of hell.” Ospreay, who is a supporter but not a member of Rainham Against Pollution, fears what the smoke from the constant fires might be doing to her grandchildren’s lungs. “It’s too late for us, but I am thinking about our children and their children,” she said. “This is our Erin Brockovich moment.”For a long time Arnolds Field was nothing more than an unloved patch of unused land. In the 1960s, gravel pits had been dug there and in subsequent years, once extraction was complete, the ground was poorly restored. The soils were too thin, so the grass was patchy and uneven, and there was rubbish scattered across the surface. For a time the land was used for grazing cows, but eventually it was deemed unsuitable for livestock and was more or less abandoned.It wasn’t until 1998 that the trouble really began. In September, a company called North London Developments bought Arnolds Field and successfully applied to Havering council for permission to turn it into a legal dump. The plan was to deposit hundreds of thousands more tonnes of inert waste, after which the company would level it off and replenish the topsoils. The height and the shape of the land would remain the same but the quality of the soil would improve. Then it would be used for farming.The reality was very different. By January 1999, dozens of tipper lorries were hurtling through Rainham every day, on their way to Arnolds Field. Unlike the lorries that would regularly collect gravel from local pits and transport it to construction sites, these ones were not emblazoned with a company name. Their trailers had high metal sides so you couldn’t see what was inside. Steam or smoke would sometimes seep out, and the smell could be horrendous. “Some of them made you heave as they drove past,” Jim Catlin, a local fisherman, told me.Whatever they were carrying, the lorries would empty their load on Arnolds Field, and giant earthmovers and bulldozers would bury it. Activity continued after dark. Terry Evens, 86, whose house overlooks Arnolds Field, remembers being woken on many occasions by the screeching of brakes and the muffled sounds of pistons. In the morning, his window sills would be covered in black dust. Rumours spread that the dumping was connected to a transnational crime syndicate. “There was no way I was going to approach the lorry drivers to ask what was inside,” Catlin told me. “I’d be in the Thames right now!”The waste business is lucrative, and is often exploited by criminal organisations. It’s expensive to dispose of waste legally. By burying it under private land or industrial plots, criminal groups can undercut legitimate disposal companies and still pocket large chunks of the money. The results for public health can be devastating. Perhaps the most notorious case is in the Campania region of southern Italy, where the Camorra mafia has made enormous sums by illegally burying millions of tonnes of toxic waste, which has polluted the soil and the water table. Much of this toxic waste has also been burned. The result is that in one area north of Naples, dubbed “the triangle of death”, cancer rates are far higher than in the rest of the country.By the summer of 1999, so much waste had been dumped on Arnolds Field that it was unrecognisable. A giant sloped embankment had been built up along one side. These are common around gravel extraction sites, because they prevent noise and dust from escaping, but locals feared it was meant to conceal whatever was going on inside. In some areas on the site, they could glimpse new mounds of rubbish and soil rising high into the sky. They were increasingly worried that the waste was hazardous and would pollute the local waterways. They demanded that Havering council stop the lorries from coming, and remove any illegal waste they’d already dumped.Jeffrey Tucker was elected as a local councillor for Rainham and Wennington ward in May 2002. Almost right away, he started receiving calls about Arnolds Field. “My phone was hot,” he told me. In spring 2003, Tucker met John Reilly, the landowner and director of North London Developments, at Arnolds Field. Reilly greeted him politely and offered him a tour of the site. It was a mess, with litter strewn everywhere and rubble poking up through the ground, according to Tucker’s former secretary, who was also in attendance.Reilly led them into a small cabin, where Tucker raised his concerns. Reilly was friendly, and asked whether Tucker had a favourite charity to which he could offer a donation. The former secretary says she told Tucker not to accept the offer, and left the cabin. Moments later, Tucker wandered out holding an envelope containing a cheque for £3,000, made out to a local primary school. (When I put this to the school, I was directed to Havering council, which said: “We are not aware of, or able to comment on, something that allegedly happened in 2003 involving a former ward councillor and who was not in the administration at the time.”) Tucker told me that it did not occur to him that Reilly might want something in return for the cheque. He had visited Reilly to get “some sort of compensation”, believing it was “the “least he could do as a newly elected councillor”. He continued to pass on the residents’ complaints to the council, he said. (Reilly did not respond to requests for comment.)In April 2004, Havering council’s planning committee met to discuss complaints about Arnolds Field. Three months later it issued an enforcement notice to North London Developments, requiring it to stop importing and spreading any further waste materials, and to remove excess illegal waste. After some legal back and forth, in November 2005, an agent from the Planning Inspectorate, a central government body, upheld the notices and required that all unauthorised material be removed from the site within 12 months.But just before that deadline expired, Reilly dissolved the company. In 2008, he transferred ownership of the land to himself personally. Havering council told me that it sought legal advice about whether to prosecute Reilly for failing to comply with the enforcement notice, but had decided against doing so. Instead, they attempted to negotiate with him. The illegal dumping seems to have continued for the next six years.Meanwhile, residents were growing increasingly concerned about the strange activities that seemed to be going on at Arnolds Field. As they would discover, they had every reason to be.In the early hours of 12 February 2011, an officer at the Metropolitan police received a call from a man who claimed to be on Arnolds Field. He was a security guard and he said that a group of armed men had arrived to conduct a robbery. The call dropped and when it reconnected the man informed the officer that the robbers had gone and he no longer needed assistance.Over the next 10 days, the police conducted aerial surveillance of the area. In the early morning of 22 February, a group of officers arrived to do a ground search. In one corner of the site they found an illegal dump, strewn with car batteries, kitchen stoves, carpets and piles of rubble. When they inspected the other side of Arnolds Field they found something more surprising. Along a muddy pathway, concealed behind the sloped embankment, there was an array of generators and mobile cabins, including a canteen and sleeping quarters. In one office, guarded by dogs, there was a Kalashnikov rifle, a handgun, two sawn-off shotguns, ammunition and petrol bombs. There was also tens of thousands of pounds in cash and, oddly, hundreds of high-wattage lightbulbs.That final discovery started to make sense when, in one of the mobile cabins, the officers found concealed trap doors. They had stumbled on a cannabis factory, housed in interconnected shipping containers. Through a maze of underground passages they discovered two more cannabis laboratories with about 1,000 cannabis plants. The police arrested 10 individuals on-site, including Reilly. In September 2011, Reilly pleaded guilty and received six years in prison for the production of a controlled drug and a further six for the possession of prohibited firearms. (The other men who had been arrested were acquitted; they insisted they thought they were working at a legal landfill site rather than a drug factory.)At the beginning of 2012, after complaints from Rainham residents, theEnvironment Agencycommissioned an engineering company to assess Arnolds Field for contamination. The company dug 35 pits, each about 4 metres deep. They found landfill waste – including mattresses and pieces of furniture – at each one. They didn’t find any hazardous waste, but there were elevated levels of lead and benzo(a)pyrene, a potent chemical that causes cancer, in the soil – a sign that something toxic might have been buried elsewhere on site. (McClenaghan, the local fire department commander, believes that in some places the waste reaches 12 metres – about four storeys – below the ground, well out of reach of the 2012 survey.) The engineering company noted that the land was so warm that it melted the winter snow.It seems reasonable to expect that, at this point, Havering council or the Environment Agency (EA) might have conducted further investigations and proposed a plan to address any possible contamination of the land. This is not what happened. A spokesperson for Havering council told me that the council never received a copy of the engineering company’s report, and that, in any case, an investigation into illegal dumping on Arnolds Field would be led by the EA. A spokesperson for the EA said it has no record of ever commissioning an engineering company to investigate the site, and that ultimately Havering council is the lead authority on regulating the site. (These responses – each organisation claiming to be unaware of basic facts regarding the site, while also disavowing responsibility – are characteristic of the saga of Arnolds Field, and reveal why local people are so furious about the situation.)Even after Reilly’s operation had been shut down, fly-tippers continued to carry out illegal dumping on Arnolds Field. In May 2014, the EA appointed a dozen officers to dress in camouflage and hide in bushes with binoculars in the roads leading to the site. They caught three men using a forklift truck to remove the giant concrete blocks that the agency had placed at the entrance to stop vehicles going into the field. The men were later convicted, having dumped about 20 tonnes of household and commercial waste on Arnolds Field.In March 2017, through his lawyer, Reilly – who was still in prison – put Arnolds Field up for auction. Jerry O’Donovan, an Irishman living in Upminster, a wealthy town a short drive away from Rainham, was one of the bidders. A broad-shouldered man in his 60s, with a friendly smile and a powerful voice, O’Donovan owns a company that rents out construction equipment. O’Donovan was aware of the chequered history of Arnolds Field, but he told me he had assumed that the site had been cleaned up following Reilly’s arrest. He was looking for a big parcel of land where he could build warehouses to store his inventory; Arnolds Field seemed ideal. He instructed his solicitor to commission the standard conveyancing searches from Havering council, and these made no mention of contamination. He assumed the land had simply been excavated and filled with clean earth in the years after Reilly’s arrest. “You either buy it or you don’t buy it at auction, you don’t get time to go digging holes,” O’Donovan told me.The report from the council did, however, specify that the land was designated greenbelt, meaning it is protected from most forms of development. This would prevent O’Donovan from building warehouses unless he could convince the council to make an exception. Somewhat astonishingly, O’Donovan says he missed this crucial point. In September 2017, his company bought the land for £440,000. With exquisite understatement, he told me: “It’s looking like it could be a costly mistake.”Over the past few years, the fires on Arnolds Field have intensified. In May 2020, one particularly fierce blaze required 70 firefighters from seven fire stations to extinguish it. During the worst fires, the sky darkens. “You smell the fire, and feel the intense heat, and you think, ‘Oh shit, we’re going up again,’” says Ospreay, Havering’s deputy mayor. “It’s like hell,” she said. “You are in this sweltering bunker and you can’t see or breathe.” Residents suffer nausea, chest pains, bleeding noses. Mark James, a teacher who has lived in Rainham since 2009, experiences crippling headaches. Smoke and fumes fill the corridors at his school. “It’s absolutely unbearable,” he told me. Sometimes it is necessary to close the A1306, a busy road that runs alongside Arnolds Field and connects east London to the M25, because it is hard for drivers to see through the thick smoke. At Chandlers Chatters nursery, roughly a kilometre from the edge of Arnolds Field, Sue Allen, the manager, often has to rush the children inside and close all the windows and doors. This now happens at least six times a summer, Allen says.View image in fullscreenFirefighters attend a fire at Arnolds Field, c 2019.Photograph: London Fire BrigadeFirefighters can offer only limited help. The land is unstable, and as the waste burns, it compresses and creates cavities, some deep enough to swallow a person. “You’ll be walking across what you think is solid ground and whoosh, you’ll be gone,” McClenaghan, the fire department commander, told me. Plus, there’s no knowing what dangerous items may be lurking underground. In May 2020, a gas canister exploded and flew through the air, narrowly missing a firefighter’s head. McClenaghan now forbids firefighters from entering the site. “For me, it’s a case of: how could I sit in front of their families and say I put their loved one at risk to that level over a pile of rubbish?” he said. His firefighters spray water on to the fires from the roadside or from extended ladders placed around the perimeter of the field. Vast areas of the site remain out of reach. (The local fire brigade does not have direct access to aerial firefighting equipment, such as helicopters.)Many local people believe the fires would have been stopped a long time ago if they were happening elsewhere in the borough. Havering is home to some of the most expensive neighbourhoods in England, including Upminster and Hornchurch, but it also contains very poor areas. “We pay our council rates but the council doesn’t listen to anyone in Rainham,” says Norman Kalar, who runs a local newsagent.Because much of the waste is buried, fires can smoulder underground for years, emitting fumes all the while. Since moving to Rainham to be closer to her family, Lucy Wilson, a 35-year-old support teacher, has been suffering severe migraines. She says that her two children, aged three and 12, have developed asthma. Half of the 30 or so Rainham residents I spoke with told me they had developed an unshakeable cough. Six of them suffer from one or more respiratory conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.One day last year, I met Karina and Gary Falzon, whose 12-year-old son has an extremely rare type of kidney cancer. Zain has lived within a mile of Arnolds Field his entire life, and his parents believe that environmental pollutants from Arnolds Field may have played a role in his illness. When I visited the family, Zain had recently finished a round of chemotherapy and was playing video games. An air filter hummed in the corner. It was a baking hot day but the windows were closed. Zain wasn’t allowed outside because Arnolds Field was alight and he is extremely sensitive to the smoke. “My eyes start to become itchy and I constantly rub them, and it’s hard to not rub them because I’ve obviously got no eyelashes so it doesn’t filter it out,” he said.Gary and Karina worry constantly about Zain’s two younger sisters getting ill too. In the bath and when they’re tucking them into bed, they scan their bodies, checking for symptoms. The family house is up for sale but nobody wants to buy it. According to Sharon Sutton, the officer manager of Smartmove, a Rainham estate agent, many families in Rainham are trying to sell their homes, but there is little demand from buyers. “Why” she asked, “would people want to move to the area if there’s all this news about a toxic smoke that’s killing them?”To Rainham residents, July 2022 was a warning sign. That month, a fire that began in a back garden tore through 17 houses in Wennington, a village two miles south-east of Rainham. Residents stood in the street, with ash-stained faces, as their homes burned down. For many in Rainham, Arnolds Field seemed like an even more disastrous accident waiting to happen.Mark James, the teacher, had recently started a Facebook group for local people to vent their frustrations. After the Wennington fire, he arranged a crisis meeting at a nearby social club. “The residents of Rainham have been far too tolerant for far too long,” Jamessaidto a crowd of about 200 angry attendees. Not long afterwards, James, Coral Jeffery and Shaun Newton, a retired civil servant, formed Rainham Against Pollution. When the group met with the chief executive of Havering council, he told them that O’Donovan, the owner of Arnolds Field, was the one who was responsible for stopping the fires.At first, O’Donovan was reluctant to meet with Rainham Against Pollution. He describes himself as a private man, who doesn’t communicate well in person. But social media was rife with vitriol towards him. There were unfounded suggestions that he and his family were criminals with connections to Reilly. There were rumours that he wasn’t cooperating with Havering council to stop the fires. Some local people had allegedly threatened him. Two of the diggers on his yard in Upminster were set on fire, and O’Donovan suspects angry residents were to blame.He wanted to set the record straight, and in May 2023, he sat down with James, Jeffery and Newton. He handed them paperwork containing his plans for Arnolds Field. He wanted to convert a small part of the land into a depot for his vehicles and machinery. He would also remove all of the waste that had been buried, and the fires would stop. Around the rest of the land, he would plant hundreds of trees and bushes, and open it up as a public woodland. O’Donovan believed this work would take a decade and cost up to £20m, which he would fund through loans and investors. In return for their money, investors would take shares in O’Donovan’s companies and be rewarded with dividends.To enact the plan, O’Donovan needed to persuade Havering council to make an exception and permit him to build on greenbelt land. He was seeking pre-application advice, whereby the council advises on a proposal before the developer submits a formal application. But, he said, Havering council was being puzzlingly unresponsive. At the meeting, he handed around a timeline that detailed dozens of emails and letters sent to the council’s planning department, to which the council had either not replied or replied very slowly. It also showed that, in 2021, Havering council had suggested a pre-application fee that was more than five times the original price quoted a few months earlier. (A spokesperson for Havering council told me that the higher fee was for an additional service.)By the end of the meeting, while some members of Rainham Against Pollution were still furious at O’Donovan, all were convinced that the council bore far more of the blame. In their view, as the council failed to stop Reilly from illegally burying waste in the first place, the fires were their responsibility – and they were essentially ignoring the problem. “It was disgraceful,” Newton says. “How many times do you keep asking questions that they don’t answer?”So much of the inaction and local fury about the fires on Arnolds Field revolves around a single, highly contested word. If the land were formally registered as “contaminated”, the council would be legally required to ensure it was cleaned up. (If the current landowner or the entity responsible for contaminating the land could not do it, the council would have to step in, and then try to recoup the costs afterwards.) But – maddeningly, in the view of campaigning groups – for a private site to be designated as “contaminated”, it is not enough to merely show evidence of contamination. You must also have evidence that the contaminants are seeping out of the site and harming the public or the environment. And proving causation in cases like this is not straightforward.It was not until 2022 that the council finally began seriously investigating these questions. One part of these ongoing studies involved measuring the levels of PM2.5, a type of air pollution that causes cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, around Arnolds Field. When the surface vegetation is burning, the levels of these particles in the air are as bad as anything in London, says Timothy Baker, a scientist at Imperial College London who monitors the data. But when you average these levels out over 24 hours, which is the time period for which the WHO provides daily recommended thresholds, they rarely – only during the most tenacious fires – exceed those limits. (The WHO does, however, say that repeated exposure to shorter spikes is dangerous.)Yet the results of the council’s investigation into PM2.5 levels are at odds with another study, conducted by Elizabeth Cooper, a lecturer in health, wellbeing and sustainable buildings at UCL. Over nine days in November and December 2022, when the Arnolds Field surface vegetation was not burning, Cooper reported that the average levels of PM2.5 in a street bordering the field did exceed the maximum 24-hour exposure recommended by the WHO.Havering council has also tested for ground contaminants. In September 2023, an engineering company dug a series of trenches to a maximum depth of 5 metres and found dangerous concentrations of arsenic, lead and benzo(a)pyrene in the field, as well as evidence of asbestos fibres. The council commissioned a review of the prevalence of certain types of cancer, linked to air pollution, in Rainham between 2011 and 2020. The report, published in summer 2024, concluded that the incidence of lung, brain and haematological cancers (ie leukaemia) were no higher in residents living close to Arnolds Field than in Havering and England more generally. (The council has also commissioned a study to measure the levels of dangerous pollutants such as lead and mercury in the air, though this has not yet been published.)In July 2024, as fierce fires once again raged on Arnolds Field, Havering council made an announcement that horrified, but did not surprise, many residents. It would not be formally designating Arnolds Field as “contaminated” land, on the grounds that it is “not open to the public” and there was “currently no evidence to suggest that the fires significantly spread contaminants to neighbouring properties”. (Meanwhile, the council continues to advise residents to “remain indoors and close windows” during fires.)When he heard about the council’s announcement, Newton was “foaming at the mouth”, he told me. He considered quitting Rainham Against Pollution altogether. The stress was too much. But then he thought about his grandchildren, and their future. “I’ll be damned if they’re going to beat us,” he said.Late last summer, when I met with Rainham Against Pollution a second time, Arnolds Field was ablaze again and morale was at an all-time low. The group was arranging a protest outside the town hall and discussing the possibility of withholding council tax in the hope of prompting action. Some of them had bought air-quality monitors to conduct their own investigations. The members were hesitant to speak on the record. Several had recently received anonymous sympathy cards through the post, with nothing written inside. None of them had suffered a bereavement, and they interpreted these letters as a threat, though they did not know who the sender could be.One of the more promising avenues for residents is the work of another local environmental group,Clear the Air in Havering, which has asked a court to review the council’s decision not to designate Arnolds Field as contaminated land. A hearing is scheduled at the Royal Court of Justice in London for March 2025. Yet this only offers limited hope. Ray Morgon, the leader of Havering council, says that it is financially inconceivable for the council to take responsibility for cleaning up the land. The council recently secured £88m in government support, in effect to avoid going bankrupt. “At the moment, we are talking about saving £300,000 by closing some of our libraries,” he told me.In Morgon’s view, it’s up to O’Donovan to submit a formal planning application and hope for the best. O’Donovan is reluctant, because the paperwork would cost him hundreds of thousands of pounds and he has been told by a senior member of Havering’s planning department that he’s unlikely to receive permission, given that Arnolds Field is within greenbelt land. Yet, O’Donovan points out, Morgon has recentlydeclared his supportfor a huge datacentre and renewable energy facility, along with thousands of new homes, that would be built on a vast expanse of greenbelt land in Havering. If Morgon can get behind that, O’Donovan wonders, why not back his plans, too?And so the residents of Rainham find themselves stuck in the middle of an apparently endless stalemate, in which everyone agrees that the situation with Arnolds Fields – constantly ablaze, polluting the air, soil and water, causing huge distress and ill-health – is unbearable and must be resolved, yet no one will accept responsibility for resolving it. The Environment Agency says the council is responsible. The council says the EA and O’Donovan are responsible. O’Donovan says it’s in the council’s hands. Ben Vaughan, a spokesperson for Havering council, told a journalist forthe Londonerthat “really the mayor’s office should handle it”. The buck is simply passed back and forth.In late February, I visited Newton at his home, a short walk from Arnolds Field. It was one of the first sunny days of 2025. The air felt cleaner than the previous times I visited, but fire season was coming soon. Reporters were knocking on doors, asking how residents were gearing up.Newton was building an Airfix model for his grandchildren when I arrived. Beside him he had his air-quality monitor, charged up and ready to go. He had been watchingToxic Town,a Netflix dramatisation of the Corby toxic waste scandal. The story follows a group of young mothers who band together to demand justice after their children are born with congenital disorders after inhaling airborne toxins. During the 1980s and 90s, the mothers discover, Corby borough council had failed to properly dispose of hazardous waste from the town’s decommissioned steelworks site. As a result, children were being born with missing limbs, or damage to fingers and toes. In 2009, after 10 years of campaigning, a high courtfound Corby borough council liable for negligence in handling the waste.The rubbishscapes of Essex: why our buried trash is back to haunt usRead moreThe series was a much-needed shot of inspiration for Newton. After nearly three years of fighting, he is the only member of Rainham Against Pollution left standing. James and Jeffery have taken a back seat because of health and personal issues. Newton often sits up until the early morning, scouring documents, filing freedom of information requests. He’s written to Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and to Erin Brockovich herself, but has not heard back.The hardest part, Newton told me, is feeling that so much of the damage is already done. Even if, by some miracle, his wishes were granted and someone were to start clearing up the land tomorrow, it would likely take another 10 years before the work is complete. During that time, Arnolds Field will continue to burn.

She said starting at Tesco 10 years ago, shoplifting was “absolutely nothing compared with what it is now”.Soaring UK crime costing up to £250bn a year, says thinktankRead moreHer observations are backed up by the British Retail Consortium’s crime survey, which foundretail theft increased 25% in 2023-24on the year before to more than 20m incidents – the highest since records began in 2003. As well as the financial cost – companies lost about £2.2bn – the BRC spotlighted violence and abuse against retail workers, with incidents rising to more than 2,000 a day.Thieves sweeping shelves of higher-priced goods, shoplifters verbally abusing staff, parents hiding items in prams, teenagers nonchalantly making off with sweets, people sweeping spirits into bags – these are just a handful of stories from dozens of people who responded to a Guardian callout about their experiences with shoplifting.“It’s very brazen,” said Katherine, 26, adding that last year a group of teenagers targeted a display solely for hay fever tablets, saying the store calculated the thieves took hundreds of pounds’ worth.She said that for retail workers, “the scary thing is you don’t know who’s carrying a knife, you don’t know what they’ve got on them.” She said it’s frustrating that Tesco head office grumbles when stock is lost but won’t invest in adequate team members or front-of-shop security in order to deter thieves.“I absolutely feel let down by head office,” she said. “They’re passing the buck on to us.”A Tesco spokesperson said the safety of customers and colleagues was its “absolute priority” and that the company had invested tens of millions of pounds in safety and security.“Recent measures include installing protective screens, providing body-worn cameras and strengthening door entry systems,” they said. “We have also invested in developing our central security hub, which is an expert team dedicated to joining up evidence and supporting the police to tackle crime and shoplifting, helping to keep our colleagues and customers safe.”Katherine said for her store, shoplifting contributed to about £3,000 of “shrinkage” (lost, damaged or missing stock) during the last six-month stock take, with common missing items including baby milk.View image in fullscreenSome shop staff say they feel they have been let down by their employers.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAPaul, a team leader for a village grocery store in Perthshire, said his colleagues recently saw a woman load a suitcase with alcohol and walk out, which they suspected would be sold on thehidden market. He said stealing alcohol occurs about three times a week, even in his small community.“It’s literally impossible to keep an eye on this level of theft,” he said. But Paul also said one of his duties is changing the store’s grocery prices each week, “and it’s very noticeable how much things have gone up in the past few years”.The Guardian also spoke to small-scale shoplifters who said they had been forced to steal the odd item regularly to survive amid thecost of living crisisandspiralling pricesin recent years.In north-east England, 45-year-old George* said he had been driven to shoplifting because his welfare payments are not enough to live on. George, a former electrician who said he had been off work for seven years because of mental health struggles, gets £783.78 a month in universal credit.But he said after covering rent (£475), electricity (about £170) and council tax (£20), he was left with less than £120 a month for groceries. George said he used a local food bank, but visits were limited to once every four weeks, and he shared custody of his 10-year-old daughter with her mother.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It brings me no joy. I dread getting caught, but hunger is hunger.”He’ll usually go to a big supermarket, pay for a basket of things but conceal a few items. “I’ve got a big coat with big pockets,” George said. “I don’t go mad, I only nick like a packet of sausages or a block of cheese, something like that.”George used to feel bad, but no longer does. “Now I just feel like it’s something I’ve got to do,” he said. “Everything’s more expensive, like the price of a chocolate bar has doubled for my kid.”However, others who admitted to occasional shoplifting said their motives were driven more by opportunity and convenience.Jaqueline*, a 57-year-old administrator in Surrey, said the first time she made off with an item was an accident after her M&S self-service kiosk failed to scan properly.Jaqueline said she realised with self-checkouts how easy shoplifting of small items was – easier, she feels, than attracting the attention of an overworked staff member when it malfunctioned. “I haven’t paid for quite a few things in the past couple of years.”She will sometimes take a lunchtime salad, vegetable or Boursin cheese – “I put it in my bag and walk away.” Jaqueline doesn’t feel guilty, partly because of recent cost rises. “They charge twice as much while giving us half the service,” she said.But watching shoplifters target his local Co-op left Tommy Cooper, a 63-year-old in Doncaster, feeling “very unsettled” about society.One morning at about 10.30am, a young man was browsing the aisles, picked up a pizza and crate of beer and “just sauntered out of the store without paying,” Cooper said. Cooper, a retired market trader, spoke to the cashier, but she told him the police probably won’t be interested.“It’s the relaxed and carefree manner of the theft that is gnawing away at my mind,” Cooper said. “It seemed like a small act of anarchy – like watching society unravel.”*Some names changedExplore more on these topicsRetail industryCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It really is.’Observer business profileHealthcare industryInterview‘Do I think doctors are going to be out of a job? Not at all’: the ex-radiologist bringing AI to healthcareJulia KolleweShez Partovi, chief innovation officer at Philips, is excited about the benefits of new technology for patients and cliniciansTue 4 Mar 2025 08.00 ESTShareTwo decades ago, Shez Partovi was working as a neuroradiologist at the US private hospital chain DignityHealthin Arizona, and remembers listening to a lecture by a nun between seeing his VIP patients from Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Sister Margaret was talking about children with diabetes on Native American reservations just 50 miles from the private hospital, who had little or no access to medical care.Partovi, now chief innovation and strategy officer at the Dutch healthcare company Philips, recalls: “She said: ‘I want you to remember there are people that are born, live and die never having seen a physician, and your job is to know that.’”It made him think: “Is that the rest of my career, to see four patients a day? How do I scale whatever impact I want to have?”He enjoyed working with patients – he still dreams about angiography, a type of X-ray used to check blood vessels. “My wife thinks I’m nuts, but it helps me … I am grounded in both the patient impact and the physician plight.” But ultimately he wanted a job where he could reach more people.So Partovi, who has postgraduate qualifications in computer science, became chief digital officer at Dignity, where he worked for 20 years, and then moved to Seattle to run Amazon Web Services’ global business development for healthcare, life sciences, genomics and medical devices. Fast forward, and the Iranian-born Canadian has been working at Philips in Amsterdam for the last four years, overseeing development of MRI and CT scanners, and image-guided therapy that uses light instead of X-rays to navigate blood vessels, all powered by artificial intelligence (AI).AI-enabled scanners and other devices will benefit patients, as well as clinicians, bringing relief to overstretched health systems such as theNHS, he argues, speaking via video link from a European radiology congress in Vienna.“The AI [in MRI scanners] is smart, speedy, precise; it scans three times faster. Everywhere in the world, and the NHS is no exception, the waiting times for patients are such because the throughput is so limited. So when you scan faster with the same or better resolution, you improve throughput and patients don’t wait as long.”A shortage of NHS radiographers has sometimes led toMRI scanners standing idle– at a time when NHS waiting lists for diagnostics and treatments remain high.The average vacancy rate in radiography is 15%and two out of three radiographers have experienced burnout due to regular overtime, according to the Society of Radiographers.Partovi says repetitive and administrative tasks will be performed increasingly by AI computer algorithms, speeding up diagnostics and other procedures. “In the UK in particular, technology can help deliver better care for more people in terms of time, quality and reliability, and it also brings the joy of medicine back to radiographers and radiologists.”Philips, which started out as a lightbulb manufacturer in 1891 and later moved into televisions, radios, cassette and video players, compact discs, electric razors and toothbrushes, has turned itself into a major healthcare technology company in recent years.It specialises in diagnostic imaging, image-guided therapy, ultrasound, personal health and home monitoring – for example for cardiac arrhythmia. It invented a helium-free MRI machine five years ago (helium is used to cool down other scanners), which is cheaper to construct, lighter and can be loaded on to a truck and taken to remote places.A new MRI scanner starts at around £1m, including AI systems, with helium-free models cheaper to install and run, but more expensive upfront. CT scanners cost from £500,000 to £1m-plus.Partovi recounts how scanning the brain has changed since he started working as a neuroradiologist in 1996 – from taking and interpreting 24 images, to 2,400 when he stopped practising in 2013, and now up to 5,000. AI helps clinicians spot anomalies in seconds, as well as summarising past findings.“If a radiologist is looking at a chest CT for lung cancer, they can find the lesions 26% faster because AI tags them,” he says. “The same study [by Philips] found 29% of lesions the radiologist didn’t even see.”Other independent research has shown similar benefits for AI technology.Computer algorithms were better at spotting breast cancer in scans than doctorsin one study, and the NHS could soon start to use thetechnology to evaluate X-rays of broken bones. Last week, UK researchers said that anAI tool could detect two-thirds of epilepsy brain lesionsthat doctors tend to miss.Partovi is adamant that, however advanced, the technology will never replace doctors. “So, do I think physicians are going to be out of a job? Not at all. Do I think some things that doctors do will be automated by AI? Yes.”Working with Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust in London, Philips has trialled a system that allows expert radiologists to remotely control scans and help technologists carry them out. The pilot speeded up scanning times of the heart, allowing 9% more patients to be screened, and reduced recall rates to zero.The AI-powered software has just been approved by the EU, and also works with scanners produced by rivals such as Germany’s Siemens and GE Healthcare in the US.Another product, LumiGuide, described by Philips as a “3D human GPS powered by light”, is in use by the NHS at Guy’s and St Thomas’s hospital in London, allowing doctors to navigate through blood vessels using light instead of X-rays. It paves the way for radiation-free, less invasive, surgery, such as complex aortic repairs.The Amsterdam-based company, which employs nearly 68,000 people globally, made sales of €18bn last year, although fourth-quarter revenues, up by 1% to €5bn, missed analysts’ expectations. Annual profit before tax fell to €115m from €123m. Sales in China plummeted, amid lower consumer spending, changes in regulation and anti-corruption measures.Philips is also paying out $1.1bn in settlements for certain ventilators and respiratory care devices in the US that had to be recalled because ofpotential health risks. Worldwide, 15m devices are affected.Despite these setbacks, Partovi predicts “tectonic shifts in healthcare” due to AI technology, which is also set to revolutionise telemedicine and remote monitoring of patients, helping to reduce pressure on health systems. “It’s just a great time to be in medicine. It really is.”He did his own medical training at McGill University in Montreal after ending up in Canada, having moved around a lot as a child. He started his career as a neuroradiologist at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, and later helped launch the biomedical informatics department at Arizona State University and taught there as a clinical professor for three years.In between, he founded five startups: four healthcare tech firms that were acquired and one other – not in health – that was a “complete failure”. They taught him to stick to his strengths, and how to build teams that work – something you do not really learn in medical school, he says.He loves living in Amsterdam, which is “like a mash-up of my two favourite cities in the world: Vancouver and Montreal. Vancouver has the outdoor life, cycling, boating, parks, cloud and rain. And Montreal has an amazing old-world charm with the cobblestone streets of Old Montreal.”CVAge58FamilyMarried with one son and two daughters.EducationComputer science and medicine at McGill University; Barrow Neurological Institute; University of British Columbia.Last holiday“A brief getaway to Istanbul with my wife.”Best advice he’s been given“Be stubborn on the vision, but flexible on the details.”Biggest regret“One cannot live in the world of regret; reflect on experiences, assimilate the wisdom, and grow.”Phrase he overuses“If it works, double down; if it doesn’t, shut it down.”How he relaxesStreet photography.Explore more on these topicsHealthcare industryObserver business profileArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingMedical researchNHSHealthinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Luke Harding reportsThis weekend’s fractious Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump andVolodymyr Zelenskyyhad much of the world talking. But what do Ukrainians make of the meeting, their president, and a possible Trump-led peace deal?The Guardian’s senior international correspondentLuke Hardinghas been inUkrainefor much of the the last three years. He tellsHelen Piddthat most Ukrainians are supportive of Zelenskyy’s approach, are in no mood to hold an election, and are experiencing a similar sense of “us against the world” that they experienced in February 2022, at the start of Russia’s invasion.Joining a Black Sea boat patrol off the coast of Odesa, Harding explains how many in the military do not see their fight as being over and are in no mood to agree to any loss of territory. At the same time, there is a growing recognition that the US is a much less reliable ally than Ukraine’s European neighbours and that substantial security arrangements will be needed if there is to be any lasting peace. According to blogger and analystAlex Kovzhun, European states are finally starting to realise that Ukraine’s fight is their fight and that this conflict will only really end in Moscow itself.Ultimately, says Harding, the pessimism held by Trump about Ukraine’s position is not something that many in the country share.Photograph: ABACA/REX/ShutterstockExplore more on these topicsUkraineToday in FocusVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyRussiaEurope"

New names will be found for roads and parks that reflect Uganda’s culture after the ruling, which was the culmination of a five-year campaign.In 2020, more than 5,800 people signed apetition asking MPsto “decolonise and rename” the dozens of statues and streets honouring colonialists, and last year John Ssempebwa, a human rights activist, filed a lawsuit in Kampala, claiming that roads and parks named by the British during colonial timesviolated Ugandans’ rights to dignity and freedom from cruel treatment.Apollo Makubuya, a lawyer and leading campaigner, said: “This ruling represents a significant step forward in the recognition of human dignity and the fight against colonial injustices.“It is essential to break free from the legacy of colonial exploitation, oppression, and impunity by embracing names that truly reflect Uganda’s independence and cultural identity,” he said.Kampala’s lord mayor, Erias Lukwago, said he was disappointed that the judge did not give a detailed judgment that addressed historical injustices and detailed those who opposed the British rulers, but added: “I think it’s long overdue for us to decolonise our streets.“I believe we can have our history, we can keep records, but not celebrate some crooks and historical figureheads that brutalised Ugandans. They need not be celebrated,” he said.However, Nicholas Opiyo, a human rights lawyer in Kampala, said the court order was a “futile … symbolic” exercise.“Let’s leave them the way they are, let’s see them, let it be a constant reminder of our past,” he said. “The best way to recommit ourselves to a new path is to remember that path and not re-erase it.“We cannot engage in a revisionist attempt to try to erase that history. To do so only on the names of streets would be selective. Our history is what it is. We must leave it, we must see it [and] we must remind ourselves of it if we are to move on from it,” he said.“I think the court’s judgment and process that led to it is a revisionist approach; that it’s engaged in a futile exercise or symbolic exercise to revise our history, which is inextricably linked to the British colonial role in our country.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentUgandaColonialismAfricaHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Trump administration imposed a 10% levy on all Chinese exports to the US last month, which has now been doubled to 20%.Trump, who won back the White House after pledging repeatedly to bring prices down, has acknowledged that his controversial trade strategycould lead them to rise. Consumers could face “some short-term disturbance”, the president conceded last month.With US retailers relying heavily on imports from Mexico andCanadato stock their shelves, top executives claimed they would have no choice but to increase prices.Target, for example, relies heavily on Mexican produce during the winter months, and fruit and vegetable prices in its stores could rise as soon as this week, according to Brian Cornell, its CEO.“Those are categories where we’ll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days,” Cornelltold the news network CNBC, pointing to produce including strawberries, avocados and bananas. “If there’s a 25% tariff, those prices will go up.”The consumer electronics retailer Best Buy said it expected the new tariffs to make their way along its supply chain. “We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,” CEO Corie Barry told investors.TheTrump administrationdefended its moves. “There may well be short-term price movements,” the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told CNBC. “But in the long term, it’s going to be completely different.”Trump, meanwhile, wrote on Truth Social, his social network: “IF COMPANIES MOVE TO THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!!!”The US’s largest trading partners have already hit back. Canada retaliated overnight with its own tariffs on US exports worth C$30bn ($20.71bn), from orange juice to motorcycles, and threatened to impose tariffs on a further C$125bn ($86.29bn) wave of US goods later this month.China plans to hit US farm products including chicken, beef, wheat and corn with 15% tariffs from next week.

The deal comes at a time Donald Trump has piled on pressure to end what he sees as China’s influence and control over the Panama canal.The deal – one month after US secretary of state Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama City – represents a swift and significant victory for the US president’s aggressive negotiations towards Panama.Following his conversations with Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino, Rubio declared that “control of the Chinese Communist party over the Panama Canal” was unacceptable and that the US would use “measures necessary to protect its rights”.CK Hutchison insisted the deal was unrelated to Trump’svow to “take back” the canal. “I would like to stress that the Transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” said co-managing director Frank Sixt.Few in Panama believe this.Tension and defiance in Panama after Trump threatens to ‘take back’ canalRead moreIn the past two weeks Panama has also taken in third-country migrants deported from the US, as part of an agreement made with Rubio, and greenlit a contentious dam project that would provide more water to the Canal.Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump’s special envoy to Latin America had previously told Politico that the canal risked becoming “obsolete” due to Panama’s failure to properly maintain the canal and tackle low water-levels that limited transits.“Trump aimed at the heart of the country, the Panama canal,” says Nehemías Jaén, a former Panamanian diplomat. “He never intended to take it. Every concession that Panama makes is a win for him.”Few Panamanians will mourn the departure of Panama Ports. In recent months, clips of the comptroller general announcing that the company had not paid “one cent” to the government over the last three years, have gone viral on social media.Many Panamanians believe that corrupt politicians struck sweetheart deals for operation of the port.“This is good for Panama and for the world,” says Mario Perez Balladares, director of a transshipment company, adding that he expected container volumes to increase at the ports in the wake of the decision.But there could be a long term negative impact on Panama’s image, according to Jaén. Just six days ago, the attorney general said he considered the contracts for the Balboa and Cristobal ports to be unconstitutional, opening the possibility that the contracts could be rescinded by Panama’s supreme court.With the purchase of Panama Ports by a US company, that legal case now looks unlikely to proceed, giving the impression that Panamanian institutions bend to US pressure rather than their own laws.“This is creating a very negative perception of Panama in terms of investor protection,” says Jaén. “Panamanians don’t want to be considered a US colony again.”Explore more on these topicsPanamaAmericasInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

At the same time, the Trump administration was “talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, aligning with a murderous dictator”.Trudeau also rejected Trump’s repeated taunts that Canada should cede its sovereignty and join the US: “That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state.”Canada’s retaliatory response includes matching tariffs on C$155bn (US$107bn) worth of US goods. The first tranche of taxes applies to C$30bn worth of goods and the remaining C$125bn would kick in within 21 days, giving Canadian companies the chance to amend supply chains.At one point Trudeau directed his comments at US voters, saying: “We don’t want to see you hurt. But your government has chosen to do this to you. As of this morning, markets are down, and inflation is set to rise dramatically all across your country. Your government has chosen to put American jobs at risk at the thousands of workplaces that succeed because of materials from Canada or because of consumers in Canada.”He said: “Americans will lose jobs. Americans will pay more for groceries, for gas, for cars, for homes.”Addressing Trump directly, Trudeau said: “Even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.”Trump has claimed that the tariffs were a response to Canada’s failure to stop fentanyl smuggling into the US, an argument Trudeau called “completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false”. Although some drugs do cross the border, in both directions, so little fentanyl enters the US from Canada that the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) does not even mention the countryin a report from 2020.Posting on social media, Trump later raised the prospect of further escalation with a warning that any retaliatory levies by Canada would prompt further measures from the US.Trump’s aggressive tactics have prompted a groundswell of patriotism, uniting provincial leaders across the political spectrum.Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, the leader of Canada’s most economically powerful province, said his government would “make sure Americans feel pain”.Ontario leader warns of ‘pain’ for US if Trump imposes tariffs on CanadaRead moreFord, who recently won re-election on a pledge to fight US taxes, says he will impose a 25% export tax on electricity it supplies to three US states if the American tariffs on Canadian goods “persist”.Ontario also pulled all American spirits and wines from its shelves, barred US companies from bidding on procurement contracts and tore up a deal withElon Musk’s Starlink company.Ford said he felt “terrible” about Canada’s response, citing his close relationship with American governors, but said the moves were necessary to send a strong message to the White House.“The stock market will go downhill faster than the American bobsled team,” he said. “When the market drops, that’s the people speaking. Isn’t this a shame.“Every country is very, very aware that if the American government is willing to do this to their own closest neighbour, ally and friend, everyone is vulnerable to a trade war.”Depending on how long the tariffs persist – and if they increase – the effects on the Canadian economy would be catastrophic.The Quebec premier, François Legault, warned on Tuesday his province could lose up to 160,000 jobs over the next few months.“We must be able to make Mr Trump pay the price for decisions that do not make sense, even for Americans,” he said in an interview with Radio-Canada.Tim Houston, the Nova Scotia premier, called ​​Trump a “shortsighted man” who “wields his power just for the sake of it”.In a statement soon after the tariffs went into effect, Houston said it was “impossible to properly describe the uncertainty and chaos” that the trade war was causing for Canadians.In neighbouring Newfoundland and Labrador, staff at the province’s liquor stores were ordered to pull all American products.“Now, more than ever, we should be supporting local and Canadian-made products where possible,” the outgoing premier, Andrew Furey, said in the release.Alberta’s rightwing populist premier, Danielle Smith, who has previously resisted calls to cut oil exports to the US, called Trump’s action “an unjustifiable economic attack on Canadians and Albertans” and said the move was “both foolish and a failure in every regard”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpCanadaMexicoJustin TrudeauAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It has also raised additional complaints against the US with the World Trade Organization.The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said Ottawa would respond with immediate 25% tariffs on C$30bn (£16.3bn) worth of US imports. He said previously that Canada would target US beer, wine, bourbon, home appliances and Florida orange juice.Tariffs will be placed on another C$125bn (£68bn) of US goods if Trump’s tariffs are still in place in 21 days. “Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship,” Trudeau said, adding that they would violate the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement signed by Trump during his first term.1:42'Donald, this is a dumb thing to do': Canada announces counter-tariffs on US – videoMexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said on Tuesday that there was no justification for Trump’s tariffs and said her government would respond with tariff and non-tariff measures.Asian markets were down – aftersharp falls in US marketson Monday – as Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.2%, Taiwan’s benchmark TWII index was off 0.5% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.3%.The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso fell to their lowest levels in a month on Tuesday.

He has pledged to bring down prices in the US, but economists have warned that consumers in the country could be adversely affected by his trade plans.A 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico and a 10% levy on China amounts to “the largest tax increase in at least a generation”,accordingto the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a thinktank that estimated the move would cost the typical US household more than $1,200 each year.Trump has vowed to go further,threatening to introduce“reciprocal” tariffs on countries that have their own duties on goods made in the US. He has said these will come into effect as soon as next month.The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, claimed that Chinese manufacturers would swallow the US tariffs. He said on Tuesday: “China’s business model is export, export, export, and that’s unacceptable. I am highly confident that the Chinese manufacturers will eat the tariffs; prices won’t go up.”Trump has said the tariffs on China are because the government has failed to stop illicit fentanyl entering the US, which Beijing says is a “pretext” to threaten China.“China opposes this move and will do what is necessary to firmly safeguard its legitimate interests,” a foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said. “If the United States … persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end.”China’s finance ministry said: “The US’s unilateral tariff increase damages the multilateral trading system, increases the burden on US companies and consumers, and undermines the foundation of economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.”The ministry said products shipped from the US to China that departed before 10 March and arrived before 12 April would not be subject to the tariffs.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsCanadaMexicoChinanewsShareReuse this content"

If we lose it, we lose one of our last windows into the universe, and Chile will lose its astronomical leadership, and the hundreds of millions of euros invested here. It will become a mediocre site and we will have to look elsewhere for future projects.”A 60-day public consultation process for the Inna project ends on 3 April.AES Chile could not be reached for comment, but a press release from December claimed that the company was committed to the “highest environmental standards”, and that its project aligned with Chile’s green hydrogen goals.“How can we compare the short-termism of an industry which will create jobs and local economic development with this long-term goal of studying and understanding the universe?” asked astronomer Eduardo Unda-Sanzana, who is leading a crusade to protect the skies of northern Chile from the University of Antofagasta.“It’s a false equivalence: human beings and the knowledge they pursue are worth considerably more than the money that ends up in their pockets each month.”Chile has pioneering light pollution regulation as part of its environmental norms, setting limits on light emissions in certain areas and promoting dark skies as a basic right.“It is nonsense to me that with 6,400km of coastline in Chile, they have to put this facility so close to the biggest telescope in the world,” said Dr Falchi.“We need to face the problem of light pollution in the same way we tackled atmospheric pollutants, where we had huge success putting red lines in place which should not be passed.“We need to do this in order to save the night sky in the long term.”This article was amended on 4 March 2025.

Over the past month, archaeologists and local volunteers have unearthed more than 450 artefacts from the waka found smashed to pieces in a creek on the northern coast of the main island, known as Rēkohu to theIndigenous Moriori.As dating and other analysis of the material gets under way, lead archaeologist Justin Maxwell expects the waka will reveal new insights about Polynesian boat building, voyaging and trade. He said the age of the waka is not yet clear.Long fight for justice ends as New Zealand treaty recognises Moriori peopleRead more“No matter how old it is, we can’t overstate how incredible it is. It is by far the most important discovery inNew Zealand, possibly Polynesia, and it will go down as one of the most important finds of all time in Polynesia,” Maxwell said.Maxwell said he knew it was an extraordinary discovery when he saw the first images, long before he set foot on the island in January to begin excavations.“Normally, when waka have been found, whether it’s elsewhere in Polynesia or in Aotearoa, you find very small parts of them. With this one, we have hundreds of components … and a wide range of materials,” Maxwell said.“These things are holy grail stuff. To find all of these components preserved is incredible and it’s going to help us learn so much more about Polynesian waka technology.”View image in fullscreenNikau Dix holds a carved waka piece found in the creek. Chatham Island, New Zealand.Photograph: Vincent Dix/Supplied by Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and HeritageLocal farmer and fisher Vincent Dix and his son Nikau first spotted unusual bits of timber last winter after heavy rains had washed out the creek. They took the planks home, initially thinking they might make a nice coffee table, but then quickly realised this was something precious when they found a carved piece.The recovered parts range from a five-metre long wooden plank with holes for lashings to small pieces of iridescent pāua (abalone) shell and obsidian used in decorations. Several smaller carved planks still hold exquisitely crafted discs of obsidian embedded in the timber. The team also found strings of plaited rope and other woven material, likely part of a sail.For Maui Solomon, the chair of the Moriori Imi Settlement Trust, there’s no doubt this is a “Moriori ancestral waka” that brought some of his ancestors to the islands hundreds of years ago.Solomon, a lifelong advocate of the correct telling of Moriori history, also recognises the waka’s notching and long bird-like handles as prominent features used in smaller traditional coastal Moriori boats.He says the discovery aligns with oral traditions recorded in 19th-century Moriori history.View image in fullscreenSmashed waka pieces in situ at excavation site. Chatham Island, New Zealand.Photograph: Justin Maxwell/Supplied by Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and HeritageThe work to determine the age of the waka is just beginning. Maxwell has permission from both Moriori andMāoritribal authorities to take small samples for radiocarbon dating and analysis to identify the materials and their sources.“The waka has to tell its own story,” said Ward Kamo, speaking on behalf of the Ngāti Mutunga o Wharekauri iwi trust.“Everything we’re hearing is that this is a very old waka and as a consequence it’s very significant. In terms of its possible link back to the original people who settled the land, it has massive significance for New Zealand as a whole.”map of chatham islandsMeanwhile, conservator Sara Gainsford and her team have set up an impromptu laboratory on the Dix family’s Wharekauri Station. There, all parts of the waka are preserved in tanks and containers, covered in water from the creek they came from.“We’re documenting everything and keeping it in a stable state so that we can give the community a chance to discuss what they want to do. It’s a lot to take in and a huge undertaking to care for a waka of this size.”A local team of conservators will look after the material over the coming weeks while the community decides the next steps, but the plan is for the material to stay on the island. This first excavation season uplifted only a small portion of the waka, Maxwell said. Most of it remains in the creek, now reburied and covered to protect it from the elements.For Solomon, the discovery is incredibly exciting.“It’s huge for Moriori, it’s huge for the Chathams, New Zealand and the Pacific.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandMāoriAsia PacificArchaeologynewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “Many of these victims are coming forward, some of them minors. People can spin or defend however they want, but inFlorida, this type of behavior is viewed as atrocious. We’re not going to accept it.”Self-styled “misogynist influencer”Andrew Tateand his brotherarrivedin Fort Lauderdale last week after flying from Bucharest to the US in a private jet, as prosecutors suspended their travel ban and a court lifted a precautionary seizure on some of their assets.The pair, who are dual US-UK citizens, were arrested inRomaniain 2022 and still face trial there. As they arrived in Florida last week, Uthmeier said: “Florida has zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women.

        "Content": "16.44 ESTA summary of today's developmentsU.S. president Donald Trump’s administration and Ukraine plan to sign the much-debated minerals deal, people familiar with the situation told Reuters. Trump told his advisers he wants to announce the agreement in his address to Congress on Tuesday evening, three of the sources said, cautioning that the deal had yet to be signed and the situation could change.After Germany’s conservatives and Social Democrats announced proposals on Tuesday to set up a 500 billion euro fund for infrastructure and overhaul borrowing rules in order to increase defence spending, leaders of both parties told reporters recent events in the U.S. put pressure on them to act.Germany’s Christian Democratic Union party leader FriedrichMerz said the economy must be brought back on a growth path with credit financed from the special fund, 100 billion of which will go to states.Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he instructed his defence minister and other officials to secure precise information on military supplies after the U.S. announced it was pausing assistance.Earlier, Zelenskyy said he is ready to sign a minerals and security agreement with the United States and to work under president Donald Trump’s “strong leadership”. While admitting his meeting with president Donald Trump “did not go the way it was supposed to”, Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine’s commitment to peace and praised Trump for providing his military with Javelins.Ukraine’s allies were not told in advance of Donald Trump’s decision to pause military aid, Poland’s foreign ministry said, as rattled European politicians reaffirmed their backing for Kyiv faced with dramatic further evidence of a US policy shift. The US president’s announcement “was made without any information or consultation, neither with Nato allies nor with the Ramstein group which is involved in supporting Ukraine,” the ministry spokesperson Paweł Wroński said on Tuesday.At least three lawmakers were injured on Tuesday after chaos erupted in Serbia’s parliament, where smoke bombs and flares were thrown. Lawmakers were scheduled to vote on a law that would increase funding for university education, but opposition parties insisted the session was illegal and should first confirm the resignation of prime minister Miloš Vučević and his government.A five-part plan to bolster Europe’s defence industry and increase its military capability could raise nearly €800bn and help provide urgent military support for Ukraine after the US suspended aid to Kyiv, the head of the European Commission said. Ursula von der Leyen said the 27-member bloc would propose giving member states more fiscal space for defence investments, as well as €150bn in loans for those investments, and would also aim to mobilise private capital.Share"

The belief in a close relationship between western Europe and the US that has dominated government policy in, for instance, Berlin, Helsinki, London and Rome is being put under intolerable strain.The pressure is especially acute for Keir Starmer, much lauded for the calmness with which he has tried to retain focus on the essential objective of keeping the US in alliance with Europe over the sovereignty and independence ofUkraine.The task is so difficult because the British military, political, intelligence and foreign policy establishment has made practical support for Ukraine a centrepiece of its Russian policy for over a decade. Now Britain’s greatest ally seems set on the destruction of that decade’s work. For the Foreign Office this is not just disorientating, but akin to suddenly living in a world without maps.When Starmer was asked on Monday afternoon by the Scottish National party MP Stephen Flynn about reports that Trump was about to withdraw aid from Ukraine, the British prime minister replied he had not seen those reports, assuring “that is not their position”.Not many hours later, Trump’s supposed confidant in Europe was on the phone to the US president – and Downing Street will not say whether he informed Starmer of his plan even then. Moreover, reports started appearing that the US was about to lift some sanctions on Russia, a step that would lift the siege on the Russian economy so painfully constructed over the past three years.Trump’s steps are an undeniable reverse for Starmer, for the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and for all those cast in the role of “Trump whisperer” or bridge between Europe and Washington. But even now they insist there is no alternative but to remain engaged, and to urge Trump to understand his hectic timetable to a ceasefire benefits only Russia.Yet late last week it appeared as if advocates of engagement were winning, since the Starmer trip to Washington had gone as well as possible. The theatrical production of an envelope containing an invitation from King Charles to a state visit and the promise to raise defence spending by 2027 was met with the suggestion of a free trade deal that would probably put the UK in a better position than the EU. The holy grail – known as the benefit of Brexit – had finally been found.But like Emmanuel Macron, who had travelled to Washington two days before, the unhappy truth was that Trump had evaded Starmer’s central request to provide a US military backstop to a European force operating inside Ukraine after a ceasefire. The only security guarantee that was needed, Trump insisted, was the guarantee that the US would have an economic stake in the future of Ukraine’s rare earth and energy resources.No amount of summit optics could avoid Trump’s refusal to commit US military assets. Nor was it possible to overlook that US diplomats on the day of Macron’s visit twice voted with Russia at the UN, both at the general assembly and the security council.As Bronwen Maddox, the Chatham House director, pointed out: this was the first time the US had voted against Europe on a matter of European security since 1945.The abuse administered to Volodymyr Zelenskyy two days after Starmer’s visit – although a diplomatic disaster best avoided – was merely a confirmation that Trump will let nothing and no one stand in the way of his strategic aim of restoring relations with Vladimir Putin.The abandonment of Ukraine, fuelled by Trump’s personal animosity to Zelenskyy and the cost of the war to the US, has become a means to the greater end, a new relationship with Russia.It is here – according to the interpretation of Russia – that tensions with Europe are at breaking point. Where Trump draws on his personal relations with Putin to insist Russia will abide by a ceasefire, Europe instead looks at Russia’s practice of breaking agreements, the point Zelenskyy sought to make in the Oval Office with disastrous effect.Where Trump sees a convivial leader an ocean away, Europe sees a tyrant on its borders. Where Trump sees peace, Europe sees subjugation. These are not perceptions that Starmer can square.Take Finland, a new member of the Nato alliance that is sharing a border with Russia. Speaking at Chatham House on Tuesday, its foreign minister, Elina Valtonen, laid out with calm precision that for all Finland’s Atlanticist instincts, it could not accept a peace that meant submission.“There can be no sustainable peace in Ukraine without a strong and sovereign Ukraine,” she said.“This is not just the political reality, it is a moral imperative. Rushing to a deal at the cost of its content, and without due consideration of the consequences, would endanger not only Ukraine, but also Europe – and, by extension, the United States for generations to come.“We Finns know Russia. Russia shares a land border with 14 countries. Only one of them has constantly remained an independent democracy through the second world war and the cold war, and that’s Finland.“History has taught us that Russia respects only strength and resolve. Russia’s current war is based on imperialistic ambitions that go beyond Ukraine. The Kremlin’s appetite does not diminish when fed, it only grows.“Take it from us. Whatever happens in this war, Russia will remain a long-term strategic threat to Euro Atlantic security, rather than encouraged.”Valtonen said there was a need to be open for re-engagement in the future, if Russia starts to adhere to international law again. “But going forward, it would be a mistake to let go about deterrence or rebuild strategic dependency on Russia, and this goes for all of Europe.”She warned: “One of our foremost diplomats and later president, [Juho Kusti] Paasikivi, was on several occasions on the other side of the table from Stalin and Molotov when our existence as an independent country was on the line in the 1930s and 1940s.“He summed it up well: ‘The constant policy of the Russians is to get what they can with as little as possible and then come back asking for more … they never sacrifice their immediate interests for future objectives … they are immune to any ethical, human or abstract legal factors.’“This is the Finnish experience. The Ukrainians know from their own experience that Russia has broken every single commitment they have ever made on Ukraine’s sovereignty. No agreement with Moscow can stand without the will and the means to enforce it.”But despite this clear-eyed assessment of Russia, shared by the Baltic nations, Valtonen, like Starmer and indeed many European politicians, is still reluctant to criticise Trump in public.Valtonen admits this is because Europe may not yet have the strength to act alone. “We need the Americans. We need the Americans militarily, but especially also to keep up the sanctions pressure, because the worst thing that could happen now is that the US says ‘let’s get off the sanctions’ and starts engaging with Russia economically, because that would be exactly the wrong cause of action now,” she said.Diplomats admit that the speed with which Trump is moving in comparison with deliberative Europe is a problem.Quite how a coalition of the willing – led by one leader long committed to Europe’s autonomy and another committed to the primacy of the Atlantic alliance - can develop is unclear.The addition to the coalition leadership of an incoming German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, means the trajectory is moving slowly towards a European preparedness to try to help Ukraine survive without the US. Germany has a leading role in providing air defence systems to Ukraine and Merz’s remarks so far suggest he wants to take a more robust stance than his SDP predecessor, Olaf Scholz.If so it is possible the advocates of engagement with Trump are losing the internal arguments as the decisions and insults pile up. Some of this is human emotion and the hand of history.The New Zealand high commissioner, Phil Goff, recalls Winston Churchill famously denouncing Neville Chamberlain, saying: “You were given the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, and you will have war.” Goff then added: “Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office, but do you think he really understands history?”Or take the anger of the Lithuanian politician Vytautas Landsbergis at the treatment of Zelenskyy: “They called the guest in, beat him up, spat on him, and threw him out the door.” What would he have done? “I would have listened silently to everything they said and said one word at the end: liars.”But it is also the accumulation of decisions being taken by Trump towards Russia, including the end of cyber operations against Russia, and other steps to make the lives of Russian oligarchs easier. It has led both London and Paris to conclude it is now very unlikely the US will provide a military backstop.Starmer and Europe then have to decide if they have the resources to help save Ukraine without US help. Much of what the EU will discuss at its summit on Thursday will help with Europe’s defence in four year’s time, but what matters is what help can be provided to Ukraine in four months when US supplies and spares run out.The threat to seize Russian state bank assets either now or if Russia breaches the terms of a ceasefire remains one of the few cards Europe can play without Trump, and by offering a ceasefire himself, Zelenskyy has also tried to kill the Trump claim that he wants endless war. But Starmer’s hope that Trump if not reliable was biddable seems to be dying.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeDonald TrumpEuropean UnionanalysisShareReuse this content"

Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under…— Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)March 4, 2025Alarmed European leaders reaffirmed their backing for Kyiv on Tuesday as it emerged that Ukraine’s Nato allies had not been told in advance of the suspension of US aid.A spokesperson for the Polish foreign ministry said Trump’s announcement “was made without any information or consultation, neither with Nato allies nor with the Ramstein group which is involved in supportingUkraine”.Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, announced proposals to increase EU defence spending, which she said could raise up to €800bn ($848bn). “This is a moment for Europe, and we are ready to step up,” she said.In his comments, Zelenskyy sketched out a plan for how the war might stop. The “first stages” could include a release of prisoners and a ban on missiles and long-range drones used to attack energy and civilian infrastructure. This “truce in the air” might be applied to the sea as well, he said, “ifRussiawill do the same”.Zelenskyy’s post came hours after theTrump administrationsaid it was blocking all deliveries of ammunition, vehicles and other equipment, including shipments agreed when Joe Biden was president.He acknowledgedhis meeting on Friday with Trump and the US vice-president, JD Vance, “did not go the way it was supposed to”. He said: “It is regrettable it happened this way. It is time to make things right. We would like future cooperation and communication to be constructive.”But his conciliatory comments appear to fall short of the grovelling apology demanded by the White House. Trump has accused Zelenskyy of disrespect, and the US president’s aides have claimed Zelenskyy provoked the row by insisting any peace deal had to comewith security guarantees. Vance also repeatedly accused Ukraine’s president of ingratitude.By way of response on Tuesday, Zelenskyy thanked Trump for providing Kyiv with Javelin missiles during his first presidential term. “We really do value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,” he said.On Tuesday, Vance denied that Trump wanted a public apology from Zelenskyy despite media reports to the contrary, saying that the “public stuff” did not matter as much as Ukrainian engagement toward a “meaningful settlement”.“We need the Ukrainians privately to come to us and say: ‘This is what we need. This is what we want. This is how we’re going to participate in the process to end this conflict,’” Vance told reporters on Capitol Hill. “That is the most important thing, and that lack of private engagement is what is most concerning.”US officials have said Zelenskyy and an adviser, Andriy Yermak, had sought the White House meeting despite theconcerns of some Trump adviserswho had said there was the potential for a clash. But there are also suspicions the White House was looking for a pretext to distance itself from Ukraine.At a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening, Trump is expected to propose plans to “restore peace around the world”. A White House official told Fox News he would “lay out his plans to end the war in Ukraine”, as well as plans to negotiate the release of hostages held in Gaza, the outlet reported.Ukraine and the US were supposed to sign a minerals deal that would have resulted in the US investing in Ukraine’s underdeveloped minerals and mining sector. Trump has said the presence of US workers in Ukraine would be enough to deter Putin from future acts of aggression, with no further security promises needed.Asked whether he believed there was still hope for the minerals deal, Vance responded: “Yeah, I certainly do.” He added: “And I think the president is still committed to the mineral deal. I think we’ve heard some positive things, but not yet, of course, a signature from our friends in Ukraine.”Kyiv was ready to sign the deal “in any time and in any convenient format”, Zelenskyy indicated. “We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively,” he wrote.“It’s a temporary pause and it’s to do a reset,” Mike Johnson, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, said of the suspension of US military aid. “I am heartened by the development that President Zelenskyy has indicated that he does want to do this deal after all … I certainly encourage that to happen and he needs to come and make right what happened last week – the shocking developments in the Oval Office – and if he does that then I think this is the win-win-win scenario for everyone involved.”Moscow celebrated Trump’s decision to suspend military aid as “the best possible step towards peace”, with the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying the US had been “the main supplier of this war so far”.Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, told a cabinet meeting in Warsaw that Europe faced unprecedented risks, including “the biggest in the last few decades when it comes to security”. Tusk said his government would have to make some “extraordinary” decisions. “A decision was announced to suspend the US aid for Ukraine, and perhaps start lifting sanctions on Russia. We don’t have any reason to think these are just words,” he said.“This puts Europe, Ukraine, Poland in a more difficult situation,” Tusk said, adding that Warsaw was determined to “intensify activities in Europe to increase our defence capabilities” while maintaining the best possible relations with the US.France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said the US decision meant it was vital Europe helped Ukraine hold the frontline against Russia, which he said was “the first line of defence for Europe and France”. The time had come for Europe to drop its dependency on US weapons, he added. “We are faced with a choice that is imposed on us, between effort and freedom, or comfort and servitude,” he told MPs.The French prime minister, François Bayrou, said the US decision to suspend weapons aid in wartime signalled that Washington was “abandoning Ukraine and letting the aggressor win” and that it was Europe’s responsibility to replace them.Bayrou told parliament that Europeans “are going to have to think about our model, about our priorities and to look at the world differently … We have seen it is more dangerous than we had though, coming from those we thought were allies.”Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said: “Two things are now essential for peace through strength: additional aid – military and financial – for Ukraine, which is defending our freedom. And a quantum leap to strengthen our EU defence.”EU leaders are scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss afive-part, €800bn (£660bn) planpresented by the European commission to bolster Europe’s defence industry, increase military capability and help provide urgent military support for Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyTrump administrationUS politicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

TheVaticansaid the two episodes of acute respiratory failure on Monday were caused by “significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and a consequent bronchospasm”.Francis also suffered a bronchospasm on Friday that caused him to vomit and inhale vomit. That episode followed a prolonged breathing crisis on 22 February, which required blood transfusions for a low platelet count.Bronchospasms are not unexpected in a patient with complex pneumonia, the Vatican official said.Cardinal Angelo De Donatis, a senior Vatican official, will replace Pope Francis in leading the Ash Wednesday service, which marks the beginning of the Christian season of Lent, on Rome’s Aventine Hill.On some days since his admission, however, Francis, who has been pontiff since 2013 and is often described as working himself to exhaustion, has continued to lead the Vatican from his hospital room, including approving individuals for sainthood last week.He has also made several staff appointments, and on Friday the Vatican released a papal letter to participants in a church training course in Rome, which was signed by Francis with a note to say it was sent from Gemelli hospital.Nightly prayer vigils for the pope’s health continued to take place at St Peter’s Basilica as well as in towns and cities acrossItalyand abroad. Vigils have also been held outside the Gemelli, which has long been the preferred hospital for pontiffs.Francis is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while training to be a priest in his native Argentina.The pope has suffered from ill health in recent years. He wasadmitted to hospital in March 2023for what was diagnosed as pneumonia. Heunderwent a colon operationin June 2021. The pontiff has often been seen using a wheelchair or a walking stick as a result of sciatic nerve pain and a knee problem.Before his latest hospital admission, the pope maintained an intense schedule, especially with events related to theCatholic jubilee year.Francis, born Jorge Bergoglio, missed his traditional Angelus prayer for a third straight Sunday and theVaticanissued a written text instead.In it, the pope thanked well-wishers for their prayers, saying: “I feel all your affection and closeness and, at this particular time, I feel as if I am ‘carried’ and supported by all God’s people. Thank you all.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisThe papacyCatholicismVaticanEuropeChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The large car park, formerly full of aid trucks, was empty on Tuesday, except for a few soldiers and the Jordanian visitors.0:50Children from Gaza arrive in Jordan for medical treatment – videoFour Jordanian air force helicopters landed on an apron of asphalt, to fly four children in particularly critical condition to Amman for emergency care. The remaining 25 came out in large ambulances, including buses for their parents, guardians and young siblings.They drove up from the southern tip whereGaza, Israel and Egypt meet, and through the area of kibbutzes and farmland where the war started on 7 October 2023 with a surprise and ferocious assault by Hamas on the rural community, in which Palestinian militants killed 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians.The convoy headed north past lines of Merkava tanks and their troops, who have been ordered to take a heightened state ofreadiness for waras the ceasefire stalled at the end of its first six-week phase.The motorcade climbed up the hills to Jerusalem and then down the steep descent through the occupied West Bank into the Jordan valley, finally skirting its way around a long line of trucks and cars that had built up when the Israeli immigration service workers went on a short strike for part of the morning.By the time the children and their parents arrived in Jordan, the sun had gone down and they were exhausted, the long day encased in the ambulances made more tiring by the Ramadan fast.Ahlam Darwish had brought her 16-month-old boy, Malik, who had been hit in the eye during an Israeli bombardment. They were from the al-Shati camp in northern Gaza, but Malik had been injured after they had been displaced by the war and the family was staying in a tent. Ahlam said a fragment from a tent pole had lodged in his eye and he needed urgent surgery.View image in fullscreenBy the time the children and their parents arrived in Jordan, the sun had gone down and they were exhausted.Photograph: Alaa Al Sukhni/ReutersSurgery is not an option in Gaza, where about 80% of hospitals and clinics have been destroyed, and 1,000 doctors, nurses and other medical workers have been killed.“Nothing was possible in Gaza,” Ahlam said, trying to keep her exhausted, squirming child in her lap. Life had begun to improve gradually over the six weeks of the ceasefire, but Netanyahu’s blockade imposed on Sunday instantly triggered a doubling in the price of flour and sugar, and along with it, the dread of renewed bombing.Seven-year-old Nada was swinging her legs off the back of another ambulance, breathing in the cool night air after a stifling day of driving. She was born with a hole in her heart and her health had been deteriorating steadily in recent months.From a bombsite in Gaza to a Texas hospital: Mazyouna’s journey to safetyRead moreHer mother, who did not give her name, heard last Friday that Nada was on the list of medical evacuees, but from then to the moment the ambulances arrived in Jordan, the trip was uncertain.“Everybody in Gaza just needs to know what their future will be. Whether we will be able to rebuild, and go back to life,” she said.“Nada will get the care she needs here, that would have been impossible in Gaza,” said Tariq al-Hamdan, an emergency room medic from Amman’s King Hussein hospital. The convoy had first set out from Amman at 4am, and had spent long periods of time at the border where the paperwork was scrutinised, but he was still elated that the mission had finally succeeded after a series of postponements and the uncertainty brought by the blockade.“We just wish we could have taken more children,” al-Hamdan said.The Jordanian government’s plan is to evacuate 2,000 of Gaza’s child patients in critical condition, so Tuesday’s operation was only a very small step in that direction. Under the agreement with Israel, the next group of children can only be evacuated once this group has been treated and returned to Gaza. By that time there is no guarantee the war will not have returned.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaJordannewsShareReuse this content"

In January, the group signaled that it will limit its attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships after a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip but warned that wider assaults could resume if needed.Trump’s first Republican administration hadsimilarly designated the Houthis in its waning days, but the designation had been revoked by Joe Biden’s Democratic administration over concerns it would badly affect the delivery of aid to Yemen, which was considered to be facing one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.Rubio suggested in his statement that such a concern was not an issue any more, saying that the US would no longer “tolerate any country engaging with terrorist organizations like the Houthis in the name of practicing legitimate international business”.Besides the “foreign terrorist organization” announcement, the state department’s “Rewards for Justice” program announced that it would pay up to $15m for information that leads to the disruption of Houthi financing.The United Nations said last month that it suspended its humanitarian operations in the stronghold of Yemen’s Houthi rebels after they detained eight more UN staffers.A father’s grief and the Made in USA bomb dropped in YemenRead moreThe rebels in recent months have detained dozens of UN staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the now-shuttered US embassy in Sana’a, Yemen’s capital.

The plan, published today, sets out proposals to rebuild the area by 2030 without removing its population.The $53bn plan is counters Donald Trump’s widely condemned call to remove Gaza’s around two million Palestinians permanently so the US can develop the territory as a tourist site for others.According to an Associated Press report, the first phase of the Egyptian plan, which is expected to be endorsed by Middle Eastern leaders later on Tuesday, calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing the more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel’s bombardment and military offensives.Hundreds of thousands of temporary housing units would be set up where Gaza’s population could live while reconstruction takes place. The rubble would be recycled, and some of it would be used as infill to create expanded lands on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast.In the following years, the plan envisages completely reshaping the strip, building “sustainable, green and walkable” housing and urban areas, with renewable energy. It renovates agricultural lands and creates industrial zones and large park areas.It also calls for opening an airport, a fishing port and a commercial port. The Oslo peace accords in the 1990s called for the opening of an airport and commercial port in Gaza, but of these only an airport was built, in 1998, and it was closed and then destroyed within about three years as the peace process collapsed.This post was amended on 4 March 2025. An earlier version said Oslo accord plans to build an airport and fishing port inGazawere not implemented. The former was built; the latter was not.ShareUpdated at11.18 EST"

The programme was pulled from iPlayer and an internal investigation launched after it emerged that the 13-year-old who narrated the film, Abdullah al-Yazouri, was the son of the deputy minister of agriculture in the Hamas government.Speaking before MPs alongside the BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, Shah described his shock at the failings that have already emerged, which he said were made both by the independent production company and figures involved in the project at the BBC.“This is a really, really bad moment,” he said. “What has been revealed is a dagger to the heart of the BBC’s claim to be impartial and to be trustworthy, which is why I and the board are determined to ask the questions.“The processes, the editorial guidelines and the standards the BBC has are very good. They’re very strong. I have a worry that it wasn’t so much the processes were at fault, as people weren’t doing their job. That’s what we need to really establish.”Davie acknowledged there had been a “serious failing” in the documentary, but said that the BBC remained highly trusted overall. He also piled pressure on Hoyo Films, the independent production company that made the documentary, by saying BBC figures “were not told” about the boy’s possible family links toHamas.The BBC has already said it has been told by Hoyo that it paid the boy’s mother via his sister’s bank account. It described it as a limited sum. The payment is being examined part of a “deep dive” investigation now taking place into the programme.There is anger within the BBC over the failure and an expectation that there will have to be consequences. There is pressure on Joanna Carr, the head of current affairs, who had editorial responsibility for the programme and is said to have watched it before it was broadcast on 17 February. However, there are also questions being asked of the head of BBC News, Deborah Turness, an even more senior figure in the corporation.Davie was also confronted about a letter signed by figures including Gary Lineker, Ruth Negga, Juliet Stevenson andMiriam Margolyes– and now said to have about 1,000 signatories overall – calling for the BBC to reinstate the documentary, describing it as an “essential piece of journalism”.Davie said that after failures in transparency had been revealed, he simply “lost trust” in the production of the film and personally ordered it to be pulled from the BBC’s services.“It was a very difficult decision,” he said. “What I did – and it was a very tough decision – was to say, at the moment, looking people in the eye, can we trust this film in terms of how it was made, the information we’ve got? And that’s where we made the decision. It’s a simple decision in that regard.”The BBC investigation is being fast-tracked and carried out by its primary troubleshooter, the director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston. He is tasked with looking at whether editorial guidelines were broken in the production process and ultimately whether anyone should be disciplined. Hamas is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK.Hoyo Films has said it is “cooperating fully with the BBC and Peter Johnston to help understand where mistakes have been made. We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors – who have no say in the war – should have their voices heard.”Shah also revealed that the disgraced newsreader Huw Edwards had not handed back more than £200,000 in salary which he earned after being arrested for accessing indecent images of children. He was given a six-month suspended prison sentence in September. “It’s not right,” said Shah. “He’s taking licence fee-payers money. And he knew what he’d done and he should return it now.”The two BBC figures also used their appearance before the culture select committee to float a series of major changes to the corporation and its funding. Shah raised the prospect of it supporting the decriminalisation of non-payment of the licence fee in return for the government taking on the costs of the BBC World Service and free TV licences for some over-75s.Both men said that making the licence fee more progressive, which could mean the wealthy would pay more, was another option that should be explored.Explore more on these topicsBBCTelevisionTelevision industryHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza expired over the weekend – and now, the only thing stopping the resumption of Israel’s assault on the territory is the will of Benjamin Netanyahu. That is the bleak reality for the hostages still alive in Gaza, and the Palestinian civilians there who were subjected to a new aid embargo on Sunday. Last night, the Israeli government was reported to beplanning to ratchet the blockade up further– with a programme of measures referred to as the “hell plan”.When the ceasefire was agreed in January, the theory was that the first phase would provide space for negotiations over a more durable truce. But those talks simply have not happened.Israelis pushing for the release of more hostages in an extension to the first phase – a step that Hamas, fearing the loss of its only source of leverage, refuses to countenance. Both sides are now making preparations for the resumption of violence.The question now is whether there is any way to return to the agreed track – and whether the White House is prepared to impose the kind of pressure that might bring it about. In today’s newsletter,Julian Borger, the Guardian’s senior international correspondent reporting from Jerusalem, explains why there is such pessimism about that happening. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesUkraine| Donald Trump hassuspended delivery of all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking billions in crucial shipments as the White House piles pressure on Ukraine to sue for peace with Vladimir Putin. The Trump administration was earlier reported to be drawing up a plan to restore ties with Russia and lift sanctions on the Kremlin.Education| Labour is preparingmajor changes to special educational needs provisionin English schools, as individual councils raise the alarm over debts running into hundreds of millions of pounds. With councils currently paying to send many children to private schools because of a lack of adequate local options, the government is believed to be considering measures that would prioritise state provision.Tariffs| China and Canadaunveiled retaliatory measures against the USafter Donald Trump imposed his sweeping tariffs plan on Tuesday, despite warnings it could spark an escalating trade war. The new US tariffs stand at 25% against goods from Canada and Mexico and 20% against those from China.Obesity| More than half of adults and a third of children and young people worldwidewill be overweight or obese by 2050, posing an “unparalleled threat” of early death and enormous strain on healthcare systems, a report warns. There are now 2.11 billion adults aged 25 or above who are overweight or obese, against 731 million in 1990.Art| The self-taught Scottish painter Jack Vettriano, who became hugely popular despite being shunned by critics,has been found dead at his apartment in Nicein the south of France, his publicist has said. He was 73.In depth: ‘The only person with the leverage to stop a return to war is Donald Trump’View image in fullscreenPalestinian children gather to receive food from a charity kitchen in Khan Younis.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersThe ceasefire, which began on 19 January, came after months of agonising negotiations. When it finally came, the deal set out a mechanism that would see the release of 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight others who died in captivity. In exchange, Israel has freed more than 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.Now, though, any apparent momentum created by that progress appears illusory. “Netanyahu never wanted the second phase to happen,” Julian Borger said. “At this point, it looks like the only person with the leverage to stop a return to war isDonald Trump.”What happened during the first phase?The ceasefire has largely held – but with significant wobbles. Israel has accusedHamasof chaotic handovers for propaganda purposes that put the living hostages in danger, and came close to bringing the deal to an end when it was discovered that it handed over someone else’s body instead of Shiri Bibas, who was 32 when she was abducted with her two children on 7 October 2023 and became a symbol of the campaign to get the hostages out.Meanwhile, Hamas has accused Israel of letting significantlyless aid than promisedinto Gaza – and of attacks that violate the deal. Gaza’s health ministry said on Sunday that 116 people have been killed by IDF attacks on Gaza since the ceasefire began. Israel has alsorefused to withdraw from the Philadelphi corridor, along the Gaza-Egypt border.At the same time, Israel has significantly stepped up its operations in the West Bank, where about40,000 people have been forced from their homesby a new assault on militant groups based in four refugee camps – the biggest forced displacement since the 1967 six-day war.What was meant to happen to enact the second phase?View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, and Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu in January.Photograph: Maayan Toaf/Israel GPO/Zuma Press/Rex/ShutterstockThe theory of the deal was that negotiations would begin to agree terms for a permanent truce, which was supposed to start on Sunday. Talks were meant to cover a short-term deal for the return of about 60 remaining hostages – some of whom are dead – as well as the shape of a long-term plan for Gaza’s governance. A second phase would theoretically involve the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory.But those talks have been repeatedly postponed. Instead, Israel has been pushing for an extension to the first stage of the ceasefire and the release of half of the remaining hostages without any significant new concessions in return. Hamas says that it wants to negotiate the second stage as planned.Netanyahu has said that the plan to extend the first phase through Ramadan and Passover was the brainchild of Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East (pictured above with Netanyahu).“They’re framing it as Hamas refusing to accept Witkoff’s suggestion,” Julian said. “But we haven’t heard from Witkoff at all. It’s not impossible that this was something he suggested as a what-if, and Netanyahu is trying to lock him into the idea by making it public.” The supposed Witkoff plan, he noted, is very similar to the proposal that Israel took to discussions in Cairo last week.Why have talks stalled?A key issue has been the stark divide between the two sides on what Gaza’s future governance might look like: Hamas has refused to countenance any proposals that send its officials into exile. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has hardened his line on what negotiations might cover over the course of the first phase, and now says Israel is ready to return to war unless Hamas voluntarily disarms.A comfortable majority of Israelis want a continuation of the ceasefire,opinion polls suggest– but Netanyahu’s reliance on the extreme right to keep his government from collapsing has been a key influence on his approach. They have insisted that any outcome short of “total victory” over Hamas is unacceptable. Hamas sees little advantage in releasing more hostages without an ironclad move to a permanent truce: with every hostage that is freed, it loses more of its leverage over what happens next.Netanyahu has refused to allow Israeli negotiators to enter serious discussions about a second phase. “It is just not something he is politically prepared to do,” Julian said. “Withdrawing Israeli troops from the Philadelphi corridor is something that would threaten to break up his coalition, because the far right would not accept it. Many commentators at the time the deal was initially struck thought this was something that Netanyahu had been pushed into by Trump, and that he would try to bring it down before a second phase began.” It is hard to argue with that analysis today.Where does the ceasefire stand today?It is still just about holding, but has no guardrails to keep it from ending at any time. Yesterday, a stabbing in the Israeli city of Haifa left one dead and several people wounded. Meanwhile, an Israeli strike in central Rafah killed two people and another in Khan Younis wounded several more.Both sides are mobilising in preparation for a return to war: last week,the Wall Street Journal reportedthat Hamas has appointed new commanders and started repurposing unexploded bombs as IEDs. Israeli defence officialstold the New York Timesthat extensive preparations have been made for a new and intense campaign. And over the weekend, US secretary of state Marco Rubio bypassed Congress by using “emergency authorities” to send $4bn in new weapons to Israel.Israel sought to ratchet up the pressure on Hamas as the first phase of the ceasefire expired by stopping the entry of all aid into Gaza. “There are no circumstances under which cutting off food and basic supplies to civilians is legal under the law of war,” Julian said. “And it’s interesting to note that, whereas when Biden was president Israel always denied that it was them holding up aid, Netanyahu now feels free to say quite boldly and clearly that he is cutting off all humanitarian aid to Gaza. It suggests that he feels empowered.”Now, under the so-called “hell plan”, Israel isreportedly preparingto cut off electricity and remaining water supplies, and could also move Palestinians who have returned to the north of Gaza back to the south – paving the way for the potential resumption of full-scale war.Is there any chance that the process will get back on track?It is not impossible that some agreement will be reached on an extension of the first phase, Julian said: “When Hamas turned it down, they said that they objected to ‘this formulation of the extension’, which suggests that they might accept something where they had to release fewer hostages. But they won’t feel they can accept one where their leverage in the form of hostages is halved.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Julian pointed to the White House’s move to sanction the international criminal court inan executive orderaccusing the ICC of baselessly targeting the US and Israel as evidence of how little pressure appears to be coming from Washington. The sanctions put financial and visa restrictions on those involved in investigations of US nationals and US allies.“They are protecting Netanyahu, in a very clear way, from the leading instrument of international justice,” he said. “There is a path to a second phase – but it runs through Washington. And Steve Witkoff has said that phase two has got to happen. So the question is whether Trump’s public declarations that he backs whatever Israel wants to do defines US policy – or if Witkoff has the power to do more.”What else we’ve been readingView image in fullscreenVolunteers sweep debris from the partly drained chamber in Tuel Lane lock.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“An ugly, disordered world of raw power, brute force, selfish arrogance, dodgy deals and brazen lies.

He faces the threat of the death penalty in the eight duplicate cases against him.The central allegation in all nine cases is that Johal transferred money to supposed co-conspirators, and that this was used to fund a series of attacks in Punjab in 2016-17. The Indian authorities do not claim Johal was directly involved in any of these attacks.Reprieve, the organisation that represented him during the case, said the “prosecutors supplied no credible evidence to support it, over seven years and almost 150 court hearings. NIA prosecutors have also had seven years to build a case, and have produced no physical evidence, no email trail, no CCTV footage, no record of a bank transfer, no notes or recordings of telephone calls.”Johal’s brother Gurpreet Singh Johal said: “We’ve always said the allegations against Jagtar are baseless, and now the court in Punjab has agreed, the whole case against him has been exposed as a fabrication. This demolishes the eight NIA cases – there’s nothing left. … Surely, the UK government recognises that this injustice cannot continue?”Johal’s MP, Douglas McAllister, said: “The government must act now to secure Jagtar’s release. This is a unique opportunity to secure a resolution with the Indian authorities and bring this young British man back to his family in Dumbarton. Without decisive diplomatic action, he faces being imprisoned for decades while the remaining trials drag on, despite the complete lack of credible evidence against him.”Dan Dolan, Reprieve’s executive director, said: “For Jagtar to remain imprisoned and facing a death sentence after this acquittal would be a mockery of justice. The eight essentially duplicate cases against him flagrantly violate the ‘double jeopardy’ principle, which protects people from being put on trial twice for the same crime and is enshrined in both international and Indian law. The remaining cases against him should be dropped, and Jagtar set free.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

We, and our dedicated team of staff has strived to overcome numerous challenges to continue to bring joy to families and visitors across the region and country.“Unfortunately, we could no longer see a sustainable way forward and will seek to improve our other parks using the assets and where possible team elsewhere.“We are aware that Oakwood has been a much-loved destination for generations and a rite of passage for many young visitors. It is for this reason we feel such a sense of sadness.“We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the dedication and commitment of our team members past and present, suppliers and contractors who have loyally supported us and of course all those that have visited Oakwood Theme Park over the years.

Two former employees confirmed the moves.Trump last monthorderedthe federal government to “eliminate to the maximum extent” the functions of IAF and three other independent agencies. But congressional Democrats as well as theagency’s board chairman accused the White House of exceeding its authority by attempting to shut down operations at the agency, which wasestablishedby Congress in 1969 to fund communitydevelopment projects in Latin America and the Caribbean.Trump ally Peter Marocco behind evisceration of USAid: ‘He’s a destroyer’Read more“We do not consider the assignment of Peter Marocco to the role of board chairman, sent via email to the IAF Chief Operating Office on February 28, 2025, to be a valid appointment as required by IAF’s enabling statute,” Eddy Arriola, the Senate-confirmed chair of the agency’s board, wrote in a letter sent to White House officials, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and several members of Congress on Sunday.In the letter, Arriola said that the agency’s governance was to remain “unaltered” and instructed Aviel to “deny access to IAF’s systems and files to anyone outside the organization”. Actions taken by Marocco “while improperly designated should be voided”, he said.But the White House ignored the directive.On Monday, Marocco and members of Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) arrived at the agency’s headquarters in Washington. When the meeting ended, staff received an email that made it official: Marocco was now in charge, the employee said.The Doge team members, which includedNate Cavanaugh and Ethan Shaotran, remained in the office for several more hours, after requesting access to the IAF database as well as the names and emails of the organization’s grantees, according to the employee and a person familiar with the situation.IAF has425 active projectsas of October 2024. According to the worker, all local contractors were cancelled and grantees have received notifications of terminations.On Tuesday, Dogepostedon its “wall of receipts” that it had cancelled several grants at the agency, citing claimed savings from cancellations, though many of those grants were multi-year grants already partially paid out and large portions were funded by counterpart organizations.Neither the White House nor the state department returned requests for comment.American Federation of Government Employees Local 2211, the union representing IAF employees, said it was currently exploring legal options. Workers at the agencyunionizedin September 2024.Since Trump signed the 19 February executive order, titled commencing the reduction of the federal bureaucracy, staff at the agency have been bracing for the worst while remaining hopeful that longstanding bipartisan support for their work might help persuade the administration to spare it.“Our programs have continued to demonstrate their important impact of addressing root causes of illegal migration and supporting job creation,” the IAF employee said. “Without the IAF, I think you really do remove one of the few cost-effective tools to keep people in their home communities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Before his appointment, Marocco was a Dallas-based conservative political activist who madeappearanceson podcasts falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. Hereportedlyaccompanied Doge officials when they first entered USAid headquarters in January 2025.In astatement on Saturday, US senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat of New Hampshire and the ranking member of the US Senate foreign relations committee, decried the administration’s attempt to dismantle IAF as well as the United States African Development Foundation, an independent agency created in 1980 to support grassroots groups and small enterprises that serve marginalized communities in Africa.“President’s Trump attempt to bypass the law and install his unconfirmed loyalist as an Acting Chair of the Boards of both the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) and the United States African Development Foundation (USADF) as a means to terminate their programs and their staff is unlawful and unacceptable,” Shaheen said.A person familiar with the situation at USADF said Marocco had assumed control over the agency along with IAF over the weekend. A spokesman for the agency did not immediately respond.On Tuesday, the IAF website was taken offline.Republicans have remained largely silent as Trump and Musk eviscerate the country’s foreign aid sector.Several Democratic members of Congress, including Senators Tim Kaine and Cory Booker, and congresspersons Joaquin Castro and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, wrote aletterto the White House on 19 February opposing Trump’s executive order to eliminate the agency.“Only an act of Congress – not an executive action – can dissolve or eliminate the IAF,” the letter stated. “Any attempt to unilaterally dismantle the Foundation through executive action violates the law and exceed the constitutional limits of executive authority.”Andrew Roth contributedreporting from WashingtonExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUSAidnewsShareReuse this content"

Now it’s finding out time.”The unnamed White House adviser’s quote came about during an exchange on 25 February 2025 andwas first reportedby Axios last week.The Associated Pressfiled its lawsuit against the Trump administration on 21 February, after the White House restrictedits journalists from attending presidential events.The decision by the White House came inresponse to the news agency’s refusal to referto the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America” following an executive order issued byDonald Trumpthat renamed the body of water in the US.The AP claims that the actions of theTrump administrationviolate both the first and fifth amendments of the US constitution and is an unconstitutional effort by the White House to control speech.The lawsuit names three White House officials as defendants: White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich, and chief of staff Susan Wiles.Last week, the federal judge overseeing the case, who was appointed by Trump,denieda request from AP to immediately restore full access to presidential events for its journalists.The judge acknowledged that existing case law “is uniformly unhelpful to the White House”,described the White House’s ban on AP journalists as “problematic”and indicated that the issue needed more exploration before a ruling can be made.Trump administration lawyers haveargued in court filingsthat the AP does not have a constitutional right to what they called “special media access to the president”.On Monday, the AP amended its complaint, nearly doubling the size of the document from18 pagesto32, and once again asked the federal judge toreinstate its accessto the press pool during specific presidential events.“As the DC Circuit has made clear, journalists’ ‘first amendment interest’ in access to the White House, at events both large and small, ‘undoubtedly qualifies as liberty which may not be denied without due process of law under the fifth amendment,’” the amendedcomplaint states.“The AP’s liberty interest in access is rooted in the First Amendment’s free speech and press guarantees and its related protections for news gathering.”The AP also highlighted and cited recent and ongoing instances of AP journalists being denied access and pointed out the recent decision from the White Houseto take control overwhich news organizations and reporters are allowed into the presidential press pool covering Trump.Thecomplaintstates that “rather than heed this Court’s warning that precedent ‘is uniformly unhelpful’ to the government”, the White House has “instead retaliated against the AP further” by abandoning the press pool system and “again barring the AP from the very same spaces – both small and large – that are at issue in this lawsuit.”“The AP’s journalists are also banned from larger events – including press conferences with the President and other world leaders” it adds. “The AP’s journalists, despite signing up in advance, are turned away”, and the result is that “the AP’s press credentials now provide its journalists less access to the White House than the same press credentials provide to all other members of the White House press corps.”The next hearing in this case is scheduled for 20 March.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationAssociated PressNews agenciesNewspapers & magazinesUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Trump administration imposed a 10% levy on all Chinese exports to the US last month, which has now been doubled to 20%.Trump, who won back the White House after pledging repeatedly to bring prices down, has acknowledged that his controversial trade strategycould lead them to rise. Consumers could face “some short-term disturbance”, the president conceded last month.With US retailers relying heavily on imports from Mexico andCanadato stock their shelves, top executives claimed they would have no choice but to increase prices.Target, for example, relies heavily on Mexican produce during the winter months, and fruit and vegetable prices in its stores could rise as soon as this week, according to Brian Cornell, its CEO.“Those are categories where we’ll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days,” Cornelltold the news network CNBC, pointing to produce including strawberries, avocados and bananas. “If there’s a 25% tariff, those prices will go up.”The consumer electronics retailer Best Buy said it expected the new tariffs to make their way along its supply chain. “We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,” CEO Corie Barry told investors.TheTrump administrationdefended its moves. “There may well be short-term price movements,” the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told CNBC. “But in the long term, it’s going to be completely different.”Trump, meanwhile, wrote on Truth Social, his social network: “IF COMPANIES MOVE TO THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!!!”The US’s largest trading partners have already hit back. Canada retaliated overnight with its own tariffs on US exports worth C$30bn ($20.71bn), from orange juice to motorcycles, and threatened to impose tariffs on a further C$125bn ($86.29bn) wave of US goods later this month.China plans to hit US farm products including chicken, beef, wheat and corn with 15% tariffs from next week. Mexico pledged to lay out its response on Sunday.Trump threatened to hit back against Canada’s retaliation, suggesting the US will match any Canadian tariffs on US products with US tariffs on Canadian products.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The FTSE 100 retreated 1.27% in London.Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, said: “Because of the tariffs imposed by the US, Americans will pay more for groceries, gas and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs.”Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, argued there was “no reason, rationale or justification” for tariffs to be imposed.The Nova Scotia premier, Tim Houston, called ​​Trump a “shortsighted man” who “wields his power just for the sake of it”. In a statement soon after the tariffs went into effect, Houston said it was “impossible to properly describe the uncertainty and chaos” that the trade war was causing for Canadians.In neighbouring Newfoundland and Labrador, staff at the province’s liquor stores were ordered to pull all American products. “Now, more than ever, we should be supporting local and Canadian-made products where possible,” the outgoing premier, Andrew Furey, said.The Bloc Québécois leader, Yves-François Blanchet, called the United States an “economic predator” and warned the province’s vast resources of timber and metals were at risk. “Americans will suffer inflation, isolation, distrust and lies,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpCanadaMexicoRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

State Street warned that it might vote against the nominating committee or the board leader if a company failed to meet the expectation.“We believe effective board oversight of a company’s long-term business strategy necessitates a diversity of perspectives, especially in terms of gender, race and ethnicity,” the company’s policy said last year.Just a year later, the company’s outlook seems to have changed dramatically. In itsupdated policyreleased at the beginning of March, the 30% gender requirement was gone. Also missing were requirements for companies to disclose the gender, racial and ethnic composition of its board to State Street and to have articulated diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) goals that contribute to the company’s overall strategy.Instead, State Street said that it believed “nominating committees are best placed to determining the most effective board composition and we encourage companies to ensure that there are sufficient levels of diverse experiences and perspectives represented in the boardroom”.View image in fullscreenState Street Financial Center in Boston in 2023.Photograph: Vanessa Leroy/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe company commissioned the bronze Fearless Girl statue in 2017, in the months before the #MeToo movement started to blow up on social media.At the time, the company commissioned the statue to advertise a State Street investment fund that focused on companies with female leaders. The statue, of a girl with her hands on her hips in a defiant pose, was initially placed in front of the famous Charging Bull statue of Wall Street, but was latermovedto outside the New York Stock Exchange where it has become a popular tourist attraction.State Street ended up suing the artist behind the statue for breach of contract and trademark infringement after she started selling replicas of the statue. The company and the artist, Kristen Visbal, reached asettlementlast year.State Street did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. In a statement toReuters, the company said that it reviews its proxy voting and engagement policy annually “to ensure alignment with global protocols and local laws and regulations, guided by our core principles of effective board oversight, disclosure and shareholder protection and a singular focus on value creation”.The change may seem small, but it speaks to a larger chilling effect thatDonald Trump’ssecond term is having on DEI initiatives. Since Trump’s election, multiple companies including McDonald’s, Target, Meta and Amazon, publicly announced they were dropping their DEI goals. The Trump administrationsigned executive ordersending DEI within the federal government and has promised it is looking into how to curtail DEI in the private sector.A Bloombergreportpointed out that BlackRock and Vanguard, two major investment firms in the US, similarly seemed todrop languageencouraging diversity in corporate boards in their guidelines.But some companies have reaffirmed their commitment to DEI. Costco and Apple both fought down proposals from conservative shareholder activists that called into question the companies’ DEI policies.American consumers have started to respond to companies dropping their DEI programs withboycottsagainst brands like Target and Walmart for publicly ending their DEI initiatives.Explore more on these topicsUS newsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The deal comes at a time Donald Trump has piled on pressure to end what he sees as China’s influence and control over the Panama canal.The deal – one month after US secretary of state Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama City – represents a swift and significant victory for the US president’s aggressive negotiations towards Panama.Following his conversations with Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino, Rubio declared that “control of the Chinese Communist party over the Panama Canal” was unacceptable and that the US would use “measures necessary to protect its rights”.CK Hutchison insisted the deal was unrelated to Trump’svow to “take back” the canal. “I would like to stress that the Transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” said co-managing director Frank Sixt.Few in Panama believe this.Tension and defiance in Panama after Trump threatens to ‘take back’ canalRead moreIn the past two weeks Panama has also taken in third-country migrants deported from the US, as part of an agreement made with Rubio, and greenlit a contentious dam project that would provide more water to the Canal.Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump’s special envoy to Latin America had previously told Politico that the canal risked becoming “obsolete” due to Panama’s failure to properly maintain the canal and tackle low water-levels that limited transits.“Trump aimed at the heart of the country, the Panama canal,” says Nehemías Jaén, a former Panamanian diplomat. “He never intended to take it. Every concession that Panama makes is a win for him.”Few Panamanians will mourn the departure of Panama Ports. In recent months, clips of the comptroller general announcing that the company had not paid “one cent” to the government over the last three years, have gone viral on social media.Many Panamanians believe that corrupt politicians struck sweetheart deals for operation of the port.“This is good for Panama and for the world,” says Mario Perez Balladares, director of a transshipment company, adding that he expected container volumes to increase at the ports in the wake of the decision.But there could be a long term negative impact on Panama’s image, according to Jaén. Just six days ago, the attorney general said he considered the contracts for the Balboa and Cristobal ports to be unconstitutional, opening the possibility that the contracts could be rescinded by Panama’s supreme court.With the purchase of Panama Ports by a US company, that legal case now looks unlikely to proceed, giving the impression that Panamanian institutions bend to US pressure rather than their own laws.“This is creating a very negative perception of Panama in terms of investor protection,” says Jaén. “Panamanians don’t want to be considered a US colony again.”Explore more on these topicsPanamaAmericasInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

This signifies a 157% inflation rate for eggs – a previously go-to affordable protein source for many American families.And while avian flu has been a principal driver of rising consumer egg prices, the highly concentrated egg market may also be contributing to the soaring consumer prices – and the spread of the virus, according to new analysis byFoodand Water Watch (FWW) shared exclusively with the Guardian.“Bird flu does not fully explain the sticker shock consumers experience in the egg aisle … corporate consolidation is a key culprit behind egg price spikes,” said Amanda Starbuck, lead author ofthe FWW reportThe Economic Cost of Food Monopolies: The Rotten Egg Oligarchy.“Powerful corporations that control every step of the supply chain – from breeding hens to hatching eggs to processing and distributing eggs – are making windfall profits off this crisis, raising their prices above and beyond what is necessary to cover any rising costs.”A line chart with one yellow and one red line. The yellow line is largely flat, while the red line has two large spikes.The analysis found that in some regions, prices were going up even before the new strain of the deadly H5N1 virus had affected poultry flocks and reduced egg production.The south-east, for instance, remained free of bird flu in its table egg flocks until January 2025. In fact, egg production rose in 2022 and 2023 compared with 2021 levels. Yet retail egg prices in the region increased alongside national spikes, according to FWW analysis of government data.Even as egg production recovered in 2023, prices did not come down. Between April and December 2023, national retail inventories of eggs each month exceeded the five-year average by as much as almost 13%. Yet the average egg price for consumers was higher than the five-year average each month.A line chart with one yellow and one red line. The yellow line is largely flat, while the red line has two large spikes.In one case, the country’s largest egg producer, Cal-Maine, boasted a sevenfold increase in gross profits in fiscal year 2023 compared with 2021, after increasing prices above rising costs – and despite its flocks not being affected by avian flu during that period.Cal-Maine, which produces one in every five eggs eaten in the US, issued shareholder dividends totaling $250m in fiscal year 2023 – 40 times more than the previous fiscal year. The Mississippi-based company sold 7% more eggs in 2024 compared with 2021 and tripled its profits over the same period, according to company filings.Two sets of bar charts, one yellow and one red. The yellow bars are of similar height, the red bars are mostly short except for one large bar.A separate analysis also found that avian flu alone cannot explain consumer prices, which rose by 61% over the past six months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The direct costs related to losing hen flocks account for a 12-24% increase in retail prices, according to a study by the University ofArkansas looking at the impact of the outbreak in 2022-23. (Additional factors related to avian flu – such as industry adjustments and policy changes – that have probably evolved since the study may also contribute to recent price increases.)“The working class is struggling to afford groceries while companies like Cal-Maine are raking in huge profits and rewarding their shareholders,” said the Democratic congressman Ro Khanna. “The Trump administration has the power to lower grocery bills, but instead they are imposing blanket tariffs on allies, firing federal workers who are trying to prevent the bird flu, and putting billionaires over ordinary Americans.”Cal-Maine did not respond to requests for comment on the findings.Nationwide, 166 million poultry have been culled since the virus began spreading through commercial flocks in early 2022. There were 9% fewer egg-laying hens in January 2025 compared with three years earlier, according to US Department of Agriculture (USDA) figures.The vast majority of avian flu outbreaks have been on factory farms where hundreds of thousands or sometimes millions of egg-laying hens are caged in close proximity, creatingideal conditionsfor the rapid spread of infectious diseases.In February, an outbreak was detected in a flock of almost 3.1 million egg-laying hens in Darke county, Ohio, according to USDA data. If one hen is infected, federal regulations call for the entire flock at the affected site to be killed – due to the risks posed by the deadly and highly contagious virus to other poultry, animals and humans, further disrupting supply and increasing costs.“These same companies exacerbate the bird flu outbreak by raising their birds on factory farms, crammed together in hundreds of thousands or millions, creating the perfect breeding ground for disease,” said Starbuck.Two clusters of yellow chicken icons.So far 70 human cases have been confirmed in the US. One person has died and another three have required hospital treatment. Almost 1,000 cattle herds have been infected, and the virus has been detected in poultry inalmost every single US territory.More than 54 million birdshave been affected in the past three-months.The egg production industry – like the retailer sector that producers mostly sell to – is highly concentrated. This gives a handful of big corporations the opportunity to influence prices outside the impact of shocks like avian flu and the Covid-19 pandemic on supply and demand.The top five egg companies own almost half (46%) of all egg-laying commercial hens. Headquartered in Mississippi, Cal-Maine is the only publicly traded US egg producer, and has75% more hensthan the next largest company.Cal-Maine did not experience any bird flu outbreaks in its flocks in its 2023 fiscal year – and actually sold more eggs in 2023 than in the previous two years. Yet the company still sold conventional eggs at inflated prices – 2.8 times higher compared with 2021, pocketing almost $1 more a dozen even after taking into account expenses such as feed and energy.This helped the company extract just over $1bn in “windfall profits” after accounting for production, processing and transport costs.In its financial documents, Cal-Maine suggests egg prices are outside the company’s control: “We do not sell eggs directly to consumers or set the prices at which eggs are sold to consumers.”But many of its customers rely on Cal-Maine for the majority of their egg needs, according to company filings, so the price it sells its eggs factors into grocery store prices.Buyers appear to rely heavily on a single industry data analytics firm, Urner Barry, which crunches data from companies across the supply chain to create its daily price benchmark for eggs. In turn, producers use the benchmarks for setting their egg prices for sale to retailers – though they are not required to.In other words, Urner Barry’s indices work like a feedback loop that can artificially drive up prices and harm consumers,according to previous lawsuits.According to theindustry commentator Simon Shane, “the established relationship between producers and chain buyers [major retailers] based on a single commercial price discovery system [the Urner Barry index] constitutes an impediment to a free market”.An Urner Barry spokesperson said there was no single commercial price discovery system or industry-wide pricing system in the egg industry. “We are one source of information for buyers and sellers, promoting transparency in the market by collating accurate historical transaction data. Buyers and sellers are always free to transact at different prices. Different contracts are agreed between different buyers and sellers using different formulas.”Cal-Maine’s soaring profits do not reflect the entire industry. There are no publicly accessible financial records for other major producers.Last month, a farmer-led advocacy organizationurged federal antitrustagencies to look into whether potential collusion could be exacerbating price hikes. Farm Action also called on the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether major egg producers have been slower to replace lost hen flocks compared with the 2014-15 avian flu outbreak, in order to suppress supplies and keep prices high.Almost 631m eggs were produced in January 2025 – nearly 10% fewer than January 2022, as flock sizes continue to drop. The USDA tracks pullets – the chicks hatched to replace egg-laying hens – which have been below the five-year average most months since the outbreak began in February 2022.“Based on publicly available data, we’ve observed that egg price increases far exceed what would be expected based on hen losses and the industry has not increased the number of laying hens as expected during a period of high prices. This strongly suggests potential antitrust violations,” said Angela Huffman, chief executive of Farm Action. “The FTC and DoJ have the authority to investigate beyond what is publicly available … we urge them to exercise this authority.”While consumers have been harmed by rising prices, there is no evidence of collusion, according to Bruce Babcock, professor of public policy and an expert on agriculture economics at the University of California, Riverside. “The fact that other very large egg producers had to euthanize tens of millions of birds meant that Cal-Main benefits because the price of eggs went up and Cal-Maine can get a windfall profit … That’s how markets work.”In 2024, 94% of Americans said they were very or somewhat concerned about the cost of food and consumer goods, according to Pew Research Centre. In January 2025, households across the country were again facing surging egg prices – even in areas where inventories remained stable, FWW found.In a letter sent to theWhite House, Khanna was among more than 20 Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who urged Trump to make good on his campaign promise to bring down grocery prices and investigate possible price gouging by corporations that are raking in record profits.“Egg producers and grocery stores may leverage the current avian flu outbreak as an opportunity to further constrain supply or hike up egg prices to increase profits,” the lawmakers wrote. “The egg company [Cal-Maine] and its shareholders are making higher profits while Americans shell out more for grocery staples.”On Thursday, the agriculture secretary,Brooke Rollins, outlined the Trump administration’s five-point strategy to lower egg prices. This includes investing $1bn in curbing avian flu – which she said would be partly funded by working with Elon Musk’s team “to cut hundreds of millions of dollars of wasteful spending”.Federal employee layoffs and public health blackouts measures have alreadydisruptedtracking, testing and messaging for avian flu.The agriculture secretary also signaled plans to move away from culling entire flocks, the depopulation measure currently mandated, in favor of new vaccines and biosecurity measures like improved protective gear and procedures. The administration is considering temporarily allowing egg exports and claimed California legislation that requires minimum space for egg-laying hens, is driving up production costs, Rollins added.Explore more on these topicsUS newsOur unequal earthFoodEggsnewsShareReuse this content"

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, meanwhiletoldpodcaster Joe Rogan that its AI will “probably” be able to act as “a sort of midlevel engineer” as soon as this year.“Workers are at a relatively weak point,” said top labor scholar David Madland, who argued the AI protection rollbacks under Trump “made it even more so that workers are at the whims of their employers on how AI is deployed”.Read the signs of Trump’s federal firings: AI is coming for private sector jobs tooRead more“I think they’re going to be at real risk of having their jobs degraded in many different kinds of ways,” said Madland, a senior fellow and senior adviser to the American Worker Project at Center for American Progress. “The Biden administration rules provided very modest – only very modest – protections, but they were better than nothing.”Under Trump the US government is “promoting and encouraging AI innovation to ensure America remains the leader in this cutting edge technology”, Victoria LaCivita, White House office of science and technology policy Sspokesperson, said in a statement. “The Trump administration is committed to ensuring the continued American leadership in AI.”Among theguidelines removedby the Trump administration were directivesissuedby the US Department of Labor to ensure employers create and implement AI in the workplace without diminishing job quality or violating workers’ rights. Significant cuts are alsoexpectedat the US AI Safety Institute, as part of Trump’s efforts to cull the federal workforce.“It strips out consideration of civil rights, job quality and the impact on workers,” said Josh Boxerman, government affairs manager for the National Employment Law Project.He pointed to concerns about the degrading quality of jobs, rather than their displacement. AI is increasingly being used to manage workers, from impacts on surveillance and productivity pressures on Amazon warehouse workers, algorithm management of ride share drivers with gig apps such as Uber and Lyft, and recent growing trends of gig work in the healthcare industry, including algorithms used to mass deny health insurance claims and appsusingAI to undercut pay and working conditions for nurses.“The story of displacement right now is not just workers being replaced by robots or work being automated away, but also workers being replaced or jobs being replaced by jobs of lower quality,” said Boxerman. Trump, he noted, won back the presidency last year after successfully seeking support from the working class.Many of the tech companies at the heart of the AI boom, including Meta, Google and Amazon, lined up to support Trump’s inauguration with donations. The OpenAI co-founder Sam Altmanpersonally donated $1m.Recent pollingby Pew Research found 52% of US workers are worried about the future impacts of AI in the workplace, with 32% expecting it will lead to fewer job opportunities for them.“In the absence of strong guardrails, those tools are creating real-world harms when companies and government agencies use them to help decidewho gets a job, who gets a loan,who goes to jail, and a host of other sensitive decisions,”wroteattorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union on Trump’s AI executive orders.The use of AI, and its impact on workers, was front on mind when the Writers Guild of America and actors represented by Sag-Aftrasecured their 2023 contracts.John Rogers, a screenwriter and board member with the Writers Guild of America West, said: “The general concern is always that corporations will attempt to maximize the profits at the expense of the workers. AI is the dream of capital everywhere, which is it would be nice to have income with no workers. So we always have to be aware of that.”As AI progresses and its use expands, there are ongoing concerns about writers’ work being stolen to develop the technology, he said. “Right now, there is no consequence for companies that are valued at billions of dollars being valued only because they stole other people’s work,” added Rogers.“There are arguments to be made that when a new technology comes along that makes things better or more efficient, you should embrace it,” he said. “This doesn’t make things better. It doesn’t do things more efficient. It doesn’t make things cheaper. The consumers don’t want AI slop. The creators don’t want their stuff sold for AI.“The only people who want AI are the people making AI, who need people to invest billions of dollars in it. And right now, not just the creators, but also the consumers, are suffering from it.”The labor department was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationArtificial intelligence (AI)US politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Staley is trying to overturn its 2023 decision to ban him from taking senior roles in the UK’s financial sector for having allegedly misled the regulator over the depth of his relationship with the convicted sex offender Epstein.Epsteinkilled himself in August 2019while in prison and awaiting trial on charges of trafficking underage girls for sex.Staley resigned as theBarclayschief executive in November 2021 over the FCA’s investigation, and ultimately lost £18m in pay and bonuses from Barclays. He was also fined £1.8m by the regulator.The FCA has made no allegations that Staley was either involved in or witnessed the kind of conduct that led to Epstein’s arrest in 2019.Evidence presented to the upper tribunal in London showed that Epstein began emailing a man named Ian Osborne in summer 2012 with the subject heading “Project Jes”, seemingly in an effort to promote Staley’s prospects of becoming the chief executive of Barclays. Barclays was searching for a replacement for Bob Diamond,who had been forced out by the Libor fixing scandal.One of the emails sent by Ian Osborne – who ran a press relations and business development consultancy – to Epstein claimed he had access to the then chancellor, George Osborne, and hoped to influence top-level officials at the Bank of England.“Let me know how you want to proceed and I will get on it, calls can happen anytime and I can see people back in London after Tuesday,” the email said. “Rupert and George are both very close to Mervyn King and top BoE [Bank of England] staff. I am seeing the chancellor anyway next Thursday.”Previous evidence outlined by the FCA showed that Epstein and Ian Osborne also discussed contacting the Barclays deputy chair Mike Rake as part of their efforts. “I won’t do anything before hearing back from you but I’m ready to go into bat for our friend,” Ian Osborne said.Epstein responded by email, passing judgment on the rival candidates for the position of Barclays CEO, saying: “Fleming is only brokerage, tossed from Merrill, Cohn is a jerk, gs [Goldman Sachs] culture vile.”Barclaysultimately chose its own head of retail and business banking, Antony Jenkins, as chief executive in August 2012. Staley would go on to secure the role three years later in 2015.The current legal case at the upper tribunal centres on a letter that Barclays sent to the regulator in October 2019, which stated that Staley “did not have a close relationship with Mr Epstein” and that his “last contact with Mr Epstein was well before he joined Barclays in 2015”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These highly nutritious Amazonian superfoods are rich in antioxidants and vitamins, and serve as a main source of income for farmers in Silva’s area. However, the lack of electricity to refrigerate the fruit makes it hard to sell their produce.Silva’s fruit-growing operation is located in the village of Boa Frente, in Novo Aripuanã municipality, one ofBrazil’s most energy-poor regions, where there is only one diesel-powered electricity generator working for a few hours a day.The 17 families in the community pay for the diesel, but because of the high price, everyone agrees to use the generator only between 6pm and 10pm. This is also the only time they can communicate with the outside world – the region has no mobile phone connection, only satellite internet.“Power is supplied for just four hours a night. The motor is switched off and only switched back on the following night,” says Silva, 72, a rural health worker and fruit-grower who has lived in the area since he was born.“I would have a much higher income if we had power to preserve the cupuaçu pulp. Our community is a big producer of tucumã, but the lack of power prevents conservation.”More than 1.3 million Brazilians still live, like Silva, with little or no electricity. Even though it has one of theworld’s cleanest power grids, the country has a vulnerability: its reliance on hydroelectric power, which causes fluctuations in power generation and blackouts in times of severe drought.View image in fullscreenBrazil has one of the cleanest energy grids in the world, but is heavily reliant on hydropower, which can lead to blackouts in drought conditions.Photograph: Jeff BotegaYet Brazil is attracting the attention of big datacentre companies, which consume huge amounts of energy. According to theBrazilian Data Centre Association(ABDC), 46 new datacentres are either under construction or being planned across the country. There are already 60 centres in operation.By using cooling systems with excessive water use, these companies consume more than small citiesVinícius OliveiraThe rush to build datacentres is part of the growing digitalisation of the Brazilian economy as large multinationals seek more data storage and processing for cloud platforms, apps, and critical private and government services.Brazil has become a hub to meet growing demand in Latin America for streaming, e-commerce and AI apps, as expanding regional server capacity is critical to minimising delays in transferring data.“If all the data was stored solely in the US, communication would be inefficient and delayed,” says João Xavier, director of institutional relations at ABDC.Rodrigo Pastl Pontes, monitoring manager at Brazil’sNational Confederation of Industry, says the need to expand the number of datacentres is closely related to “Industry 4.0” – the integration of technologies to make manufacturing more intelligent, automated and interconnected.View image in fullscreenAn impression of Scala Data Centers’ planned 700-hectare AI City in Rio Grande do Sul. ‘This is our response to the demand for artificial intelligence,’ the firm said.Illustration: Scala Data Centers“Industry 4.0 offers flexibility that meets customer requirements in real time, allowing the company to reorganise constantly,” says Pontes. “Securedatacentres are essential for this.”One studyput Brazil’s Industry 4.0 market at $1.77bn(£1.40bn) in 2022 and expects it to reach $5.6bn by 2028.With an eye on local and global markets, as well as its largely renewable power grid, Amazon andMicrosofthave announced new investments in Brazilian datacentres.Amazon plans to invest 10.1bn reais(£1.35bn) in expanding its datacentres and infrastructure over the next 10 years. The company claims to have established solar and windfarm projects with the capacity to match its energy consumption in Brazil – enough to supply 100,000 homes.View image in fullscreenItaipu hydroelectric dam in Foz do Iguaçu. Though Brazil has vast hydropower potential, recent droughts have underlined its vulnerability to the climate crisis.Photograph: Bloomberg/GettyMicrosoft is planning to invest R$14.7bn in the country. With datacentres in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the company has signed a deal with the energy company AES Brasil to be supplied for 15 years from a Rio Grande do Norte windfarm.Campaigners and experts say the problem is that implementing new energy projects, even renewable ones, could harm local communities just as the country needs to adapt its power grid to the climate crisis.Vinícius Oliveira, a specialist at theEnergy and Environment Institute, says: “The impact of datacentres depends on where they are installed and on the type of energy the Brazilian power grid will need to meet the load demanded.“We may have environmental impacts in soil, deforestation, building road access. Native flora will be eliminated. We may have real-estate speculation, with land becoming more expensive and families being displaced.” Oliveira also anticipates greater demand for water, as datacentres generally require vast amounts to cool servers.View image in fullscreenOsório windfarm in Rio Grande do Sul. Demand for power is rising so fast that small nuclear reactors are now being considered.Photograph: Alamy“By using cooling systems with excessive water use, these companies consume more than small cities,” he says, stressing that better infrastructure for distribution and power generation will also be required.“This level of investment may affect energy rates,” he adds. “In the end, the consumers bear the cost.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Projections suggestBrazil’s electricity demand will grow by more than 30% by 2050.Experts fear that datacentres’ high water consumption will raise pressure on the power grid, as hydroelectric plants supply about half of all power. Lower water levels in reservoirs raise the chances of blackouts and increase demand for pricier and more pollutingthermal power plants, fired by oil, gas and coal.Incidents such as the 2001 water crisis, which caused rationing, and the severe 2014-15 drought, when reservoirs reached record lows, show how a lack of rainfall can threaten the national power supply.View image in fullscreenItajá in Goiás during a blackout last year. Demand for electricity in Brazil is predicted to grow by more than 30% by 2050.Photograph: Vinicius Souza/AlamyYet the energy ministry remains optimistic. In a statement, it said: “The growth of the datacentre sector in Brazil shows the country’s capacity to become a technological hub in South America, driven by a robust and predominantly renewable power grid.”Mexico’s datacentre industry is booming – but are more drought and blackouts the price communities must pay?Read moreBy 2026,global datacentre power demandis projected to reach up to 1,050 terawatt-hours – equivalent to aboutfour times the UK’s annual electricity consumption. This has prompted greater interest in alternative energy sources such as small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), as seen in theplan by Alphabet, Google’s parent company, to use them in the US.According to Raul Lycurgo, president ofthe state-owned company Eletronuclear, nuclear power can meet Brazil’s needs. “Nuclear is the only [power source] that does not generate greenhouse gases,” he says.But the idea faces opposition due to high capital costs and concerns about how to manage radioactive waste. “Countries with no alternatives can afford to use a more expensive energy,” says Ricardo Lima, an energy consultant. “We have much cheaper alternatives than nuclear – we have solar, wind, hydroelectric.”Energy has been an issue as theclimate crisis increasingly tests the Brazilian power grid.

A study using theMultidimensional Energy Poverty Indexindicated that11% of Brazilian households lived in energy povertyin 2018 – a percentage rising to 16% in rural areas.View image in fullscreenElaine Santos. ‘People lose food and medication,’ she says. ‘The shortages create tension’Even in São Paulo, the country’s largest metropolis, residents face increasingly frequent blackouts. Elaine Santos, a researcher in energy poverty at the University of São Paulo, faces the problem herself, as she lives in Santo André, a suburb of the city.“People lose food and their medication; the bakery closes,” she says of the power cuts. “The shortages create tension, as everyone knows they will have to cope with their losses alone in neighbourhoods where people live in extremely vulnerable conditions.”Santos believes the tech companies must look at the local effects caused by their growing share of the country’s power supply.“If they are going to build datacentres where people don’t even have access to power, the companies need to provide compensation,” she argues. “Since Brazil is being sold, the compensation must be robust.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanInternetEnergy efficiencyAccess to energyEnergyAmazonMicrosoftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And the Australian government still doesn’t have clear guidelines and has no real regulations for generative AI.”Lyn Tranter, a veteran agent and the owner of Australian Literary Management, said she was “totally and utterly perplexed” by the publisher pursuing consent from its stable of writers in that timeframe.“It’s a serious matter,” she said. “[AI] is not included in the original contract, so an addendum has to be done, and I think that’s something that has to be treated seriously and looked into and weighed up.“To be honest, I don’t think they [Black Inc] know what they’re doing.”The Australian Society of Authors said Black Inc’s request for its authors to agree to such a broad grant of rights within four days was “outrageous”.“What is the rush?” asked the ASA’s chief executive, Lucy Hayward.“We don’t know who Black Inc will sub-license to, what conditions they will impose, or what the fee will be. Asking for blanket permission for all future licensing – particularly under time pressure – is unnecessary and unfair.”Hayward also said the 50/50 split – similar to the offer HarperCollins put before its stable of writers last year – did not represent fair compensation.“The ASA supports the US Authors Guild’s guidance on a fair split for AI licensing deals – 75% to the author and 25% to the publisher on the basis that it is the authors’ expression and ideas – the text – that are of most value in AI training, and it is authors’ and illustrators’ work that is likely to be displaced or supplanted by this technology,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The statement did not say which AI companies it was negotiating with.Nash said “many” writers had granted Black Inc permission to sub-license their work in this way.“We believe authors should be credited and compensated appropriately and that safeguards are necessary to protect ownership rights in response to increasing industrial automation.”A Melbourne literary agent, Jenny Darling, questioned why publishers were brokering deals with AI companies at all.“Publishers are in the business of publishing books,” Darling said. “Why are they entering into agreements with AI companies? Is their business not big enough, don’t they know how to make money publishing books any more?”Tranter said: “The industry is in such serious shit at the moment … what with thetakeover of Text and Affirm, it’s just the tip of the iceberg. I spoke to [a publishing colleague] and he said to me, ‘You know, we’re dead. You know, it’s just going down the toilet.’”The journalist Hamish McDonald, whose second book published by Black Inc – Melanesia: Travels in Black Oceania – is due to be released this month, said the AI deal had come “out of the blue”.“They want us to all sign by tomorrow,” he said on Monday. “I’m asking Black Inc for more information. I won’t be signing anything yet.”ChatGPT, can you write my new novel for me?

It was just too hard without all of their injured forwards, wasn’t it? Here, Mikel Arteta’s team gave their riposte.It was one-way traffic from the outset and when Leandro Trossard got his goal, ensuring that all three of Arteta’s makeshift frontline had scored, it was 5-1 and there were only 48 minutes on the clock.PSV Eindhovenwere humiliated.Martin Ødegaard changes the narrative to make patched-up Arsenal dream big | Ed AaronsRead moreMikel Merino, who before thetrip to Leicesterfour games ago had never played as a centre-forward, scored for 3-1 and before that, there was a cracker from Ethan Nwaneri. He became the third-youngest player to find the net in a Champions League knockout tie after Bojan Krkic and Jude Bellingham and it was tempting to focus on him, to say that this was the 17-year-old’s night above all of the others.Players of Nwaneri’s age should not have such intelligence with their runs, such composure in possession, such assurance with their decision-making. And that is before we talk about the sharpness of his turns, the blistering acceleration.Yet that would be to do plenty of others a disservice – especially the captain, Martin Ødegaard. When he ran through to score his second goal for 6-1, there was applause for him from some of the PSV fans by the press box. At times, it looked as though he was playing with his own ball.It was a night to make early checks on Arsenal’s previous record away wins in theChampions League. For the record, they were the 5-1 against Inter in 2003 and the 4-0 – PSV again – in 2002. They were surpassed. The two legs of this last‑16 meeting had been talked up as make‑or-break for the prolongation of Arsenal’s season. Now, the feelgood factor is back, the excitement crackling about a quarter-final against one of the Madrid clubs. By then, Gabriel Martinelli and possibly Bukayo Saka could have recovered from their injuries.The soundtrack to the occasion was provided by the sighs of the home support. What has happened to PSV? The Dutch champions were flying when the Eredivisie broke for winter, six points clear at the top. They now lag eight behind the new leaders, Ajax, having won only one in seven in the competition. They also crashed out of the Dutch Cup here last Wednesday – their first home defeat since November 2022.

The referee, Jesús Gil Manzano, who is not known in Spain for keeping his cards in his pocket, did precisely that. Arteta withdrew Lewis-Skelly not long after.

The lack of competitive rounds available on LIV is supposedly of concern to Koepka. Couples fuelled that suggestion when speaking toSeattle radio station KJR 93.3 FMthis week. “He wants to come back,” Couples said of Koepka. “I will say that I believe he really wants to come back and play the tour.”Trump is using the presidency to seek golf deals – hardly anyone’s paying attention | Mohamad BazziRead moreKoepka has previously suggestedthat he would not have made the LIV switch were it not for fitness concerns.In a fierce riposte on Tuesday on social media, which was later deleted, Mickelson took aim at Couples. “If it’s not true, he damaged a relationship which he cares about,” Mickelson, who joined LIV in 2022, wrote. “If it’s true he took away [sic] Brook’s control of the timeline and narrative. Either way this is a low class jerk move by Fred.”Mickelson’s approach could lead to an interesting scene at the annual Masters past champions’ dinner. Couples prevailed at Augusta in 1992, with Mickelson the Masters winner in 2004, 2006 and 2010. The pair will be in the same room on Tuesday of Masters week as usual.Speaking in Orlando on Tuesday, the PGA Tour’s commissioner Jay Monahan refused to directly address what would happen if a LIV golfer approach his organisation to seek a comeback. The PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund remain in protracted negotiations as they seek to align the men’s professional game.“I’m not going to get into any conversations that I did or didn’t have with players on LIV,” said Monahan when asked whether LIV players had been in touch regarding their options. “I’m focused on the players that are on the PGA Tour. It takes all of my energy and my team’s energy to make sure that we’re continuing to improve and strengthen the PGA Tour and doing so in the eyes of fans. Ultimately, that question is going to be answered through the conversations that we’re having with the PIF.”Explore more on these topicsPhil MickelsonGolfBrooks KoepkaUS sportsLIV Golf SeriesSaudi Arabia and sportnewsShareReuse this content"

On a night that lacked a little thunder but had three superb goals – Rodrygo Goes, Julián Alvarez and Brahim Díaz all stepping inside to bend the ball beyond outstretched fingers and into the far corner – the Euro derby delivered a 2-1 victory for Real but no definitive conclusion.Atlético host the second leg with optimism still; Real go to the Metropolitano with the small advantage Carlo Ancelotti requested of his players. “We could not have expected to end it here but that gives us hope,” he said.Martin Ødegaard double leads Arsenal’s 7-1 thrashing of PSV EindhovenRead moreIt had been “very tactical”, Diego Simeone said, which was about right. He may feel frustrated that an hour’s control did not yield more, his team recovering from going behind in the fourth minute to draw level only for Díaz’s goal to beat them, his players unable to truly react a second time. He certainly did feel frustrated at how they had defended the two goals. And yet, like Ancelotti, he never expected this to be settled on the first night. Besides, if it could have been better, it might also have been worse.In the last minute, Marcos Llorente had to dive in as Kylian Mbappé should have set up Vinícius Júnior for a dramatic and painfully familiar finale. But Llorente somehow got ahead of the Brazilian then and there was still time for Vinícius to dash away again, José María Giménez flying in to block. “That could have knocked us out. Maybe that leaves the door open to hope,” Simeone said. “And now, who knows, on Wednesday we could have a great night.”It will surely be more explosive than this, a single goal standing between them, all or nothing. The first leg was, well, a first leg: a slightly cautious game, more about control than the kill, which began with two teams facing each other from distance, seemingly happy to wait and see what happens.As it turned out, they did not have to wait long. The first pass Real delivered with any intent brought the opener. Fede Valverde played it, and it was simple enough. Javi Galán had a start on Rodrygo but was slow to react and misjudged his path. The Brazilian dashed into the area, turned away from Clément Lenglet and curled home: 3min 27sec and Real led. Two minutes later, Rodrygo was escaping Galán again, going down in the area – too easily, according to the referee, Clément Turpin. Next Vinícius escaped on the other wing, forcing Giménez to block. Again, it had not taken much, but Atlético appeared overawed by it all.Quick GuideLille peg back Dortmund for draw to leave last-16 tie in balanceShowLille scored with their first shot on target in the 68th minute through Hakon Haraldsson (pictured) to earn a 1-1 draw at Borussia Dortmund after Karim Adeyemi gave the hosts a half-time lead in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday.The Germans, last year's beaten finalists, were frustrated with the result after failing to extend their advantage in the opening period despite several chances.They took their foot off the gas after the break to concede a deserved equaliser from the French side who waited patiently for their opportunity.Dortmund needed some time to get into the game before Adeyemi fired them into a 22nd-minute lead with an unstoppable low drive that went in off the post.Nico Schlotterbeck came close to a second goal in the 38th but his powerful shot narrowly missed the target.

Simeone’s call for his players to keep their heads was met; “the best thing was the reaction”, he said. Real had no central midfield; Atlético occupied it and, led by Rodrigo De Paul, began to accumulate passes. Real waited deep, passively watching De Paul and Antoine Griezmann move in front of them and, occasionally, through them, an ease to it all that brought frustrated whistles from the Bernabéu. By then, Real’s lead had gone. Alvarez collected on the left side of the area, lost it, got it back again, pushed past Eduardo Camavinga, and smashed a superb, swerving shot in off the far post.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is unable to reach a long-range curling effort from Atlético Madrid’s Julián Alarez.Photograph: Juan Medina/ReutersIn the second half Thibaut Courtois denied Griezmann with a superb save and heard the whistles return. Atlético continued to exercise a kind of unhurried control which exposed some of Real’s flaws but also their own fears: at some point, they know through bitter experience, Real awaken.

The strike was similar to the two that went before and it changed the feel here, raising the volume; this was, Simeone admitted, a different game now.Rebelling a second time was not so easy, still less once Luka Modric was introduced, someone to manage midfield. Simeone responded with Conor Gallagher and Nahuel Molina and then sent on the centre‑back Robin Le Normand for Griezmann. That might have felt like a statement of intent, a response to how the game had tilted: with a second leg to come and Real stirring now, it was more important to not concede another than to seek an equaliser. Only, it was followed soon after by the introduction strikers Ángel Correa and Alexander Sorloth, two men with a habit of scoring late goals.Real have the same ability, too, of course and although there were few really clear opportunities until the 90th minute arrived – “it’s not so simple to play against the Atlético defence”, Ancelotti said – at the very last there they were: suddenly, Mbappé and Vinícius were in, their moment arriving. But Atlético survived and Real did too, living to fight again next week, when there will be no second chances and no way back.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueReal MadridAtlético MadridEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The crinkling white paper, the flimsy open-face gown that leaves patients vulnerable and freezing, the intimidating silver instruments laid out neatly on a table – it’s hardly an environment that feels empowering.Yet some of the highest highs and lowest lows of women’s lives take place in such rooms, just as they do on clay courts, snowy terrain or hardwood floors. It’s no small thing that women’s peak fertility coincides with their peak athletic performance. It’s a cruel twist of fate that just as professional female athletes must begin asking themselves whether they want to have children – and, if so, when and how – they are also focused on pushing their bodies to their limits for as long as possible.As a result, for many women competing at the elite level, family planning gets pushed to the back burner simply because there’s nowhere else for it to go. Four-time Olympic medalist Kaillie Humphries admitted in a phone interview, “There was not a thought about family planning at all” when she first began bobsledding at 17. Elite athletes and Olympians often structure their lives in four-to-12-year increments, dictated by the Olympic cycle. Humphries didn’t seriously consider having a baby until she was in her early 30s.Part of that delay stemmed from feeling like she didn’t have the option to pursue both career and motherhood.Bobsleigh, in particular, keeps athletes on the road for months at a time. (This October, Humphries and the 2026 Olympic team will head to Europe and won’t return until March.) Without female role models in the sport who had successfully balanced elite competition with raising a family, Humphries turned to her male counterparts – many of whom told her outright that it simply wasn’t possible to do both.View image in fullscreenFour-time Olympic medalist Kaillie Humphries attends a premiere last May in Los Angeles, California.Photograph: Variety/Getty ImagesThe idea that women can’t have it all – or, worse, that they don’t have the choice to try – is something that irks tennis legend and former Olympian Maria Sharapova. Though she conceived her son without fertility assistance, Sharapova is a strong advocate for women’s autonomy in deciding when and how to have children. To that end, she is an investor in Cofertility, a company offering fertility services such asIVFand egg freezing. The company also allows women to donate half their retrieved eggs in exchange for free fertility treatments.“As a professional athlete, my body was quite literally my business,” Sharapova told the Guardian via email. Women across industries face similar dilemmas, she noted, and investing in egg freezing was an easy way for her to “mitigate the strain of the so-called biological clock”. Perhaps, one day, that ticking clock will be nothing more than a relic of the past – a byproduct of an era when women’s reproductive choices were dictated by external forces rather than personal autonomy.At least, that’s Sharapova’s hope. “When women have the opportunity to navigate their careers on their own terms by freezing their eggs, they unlock more autonomy in all aspects of their lives,” she emphasized. “They can take the time to find the right partner and start a family when they are financially and emotionally ready.”Autonomy is at the root of nearly every question women ask themselves about having children. But sometimes, timing isn’t a matter of choice. Humphries learned this the hard way. Once she decided she was ready for motherhood, she assumed her body would cooperate – just as it had in so many other instances.“My body has always responded when I needed it to,” she said. “And I think this was just me being immature. This was me thinking my body was amazing. As an Olympic gold medalist, it’s always responded when I needed it to, and I just assumed that when I wanted to have kids, I’d stop using protection and get pregnant right away. And that was not the case – not even close.”Instead, Humphries was diagnosed with stage 4 endometriosis after an MRI revealed a large cyst on her ovary. When she went in to have it removed, doctors discovered that the endometriosis was widespread and had attached to her organs in a way that made surgical removal impossible. With few other options, she and her husband, fellow bobsledder Travis Armbruster, “went straight to IVF”.Make no mistake: the IVF process is grueling. And because Humphries was attempting to get pregnant while still competing at an Olympic level, she had to carve out the time and energy to stimulate her ovaries, retrieve her eggs, freeze them, thaw them, develop embryos, transfer them back into her womb, and, ultimately, carry a pregnancy to term – all while maintaining her training regimen. Navigating that process also meant having difficult conversations with the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, something she described as “tough”.Yet, in many ways, Humphries was one of the lucky ones. Her $30,000 annual salary could be put toward IVF cycles. USA Bobsled/Skeleton was supportive of her desire to become a mother. Her coaches trusted that she would be able to return to Olympic shape in time for the next Winter Games. But unlike the WNBA, which reimburses players up to $60,000 for fertility treatments such as egg freezing and IVF, Humphries said Olympic athletes are often left to fend for themselves. She and Armbruster have personally financed their IVF journey, as well as the cost of traveling with their child overseas so that Humphries can continue to compete.View image in fullscreenKaillie Humphries celebrates her Olympic monobob gold medal at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty ImagesThen, there was the matter of her ranking. If any part of her pregnancy or postpartum recovery took too long, she risked losing her standing in the sport and being forced to start over from the bottom – despite her Olympic medals and titles – simply because she chose to have a child. After giving birth, she was given 18 months to return to an elite level; otherwise, she would lose her monthly stipend, insurance and ranking in one fell swoop. Humphries returned to competition just five months postpartum.Both Humphries and Sharapova believe more conversations need to take place between older and younger female athletes. While Sharapova didn’t personally feel pressure to have a child before 30, she acknowledged, “I can easily see and understand how other women could feel that societal pressure. It’s no secret that women reach peak fertility between their late teens and late 20s. And even though the idea that women must have children during that time is outdated, it makes sense that age would still be a biological concern.”Humphries echoed that sentiment. “A lot more conversations need to happen,” she said. “And I think there needs to be a lot more support for female athletes in general. Because, as I’ve learned, getting pregnant and starting a family is not always straightforward, and it’s not always easy.”“I think, especially as female athletes and high-performance competitors, there’s not enough education or understanding around fertility. I do wish I had frozen my eggs when I was younger… it was a mad scramble when I finally did it. I could have done it at a more convenient time – during an injury, for instance, when I was already physically down.”Athletes in their 20s, she added, are almost never going to prioritize fertility planning over hiring a coach or investing in equipment. “They’re still trying to earn that first gold medal or qualify for the Olympics. They don’t have the financial means or the mental bandwidth to say, ‘You know what? Let me think about my fertility right now.’”Part of the solution lies with organizations such as national Olympic committees and individual sports federations, which could incorporate family planning into their budgets. But it’s also up to veteran athletes to step in and say, “Learn from me. Take it from me. And now, how can we support the younger generation?”“I just want everyone to have the option – because I didn’t,” Humphries concluded. “I hope the younger generation realizes, ‘You know what? You can have it all. You can be a mom. You can be competitive. You can be the best in the world.’“Look at Naomi Osaka: there are women coming back to sport and performing as badass moms. I want 20-year-olds to know: If you want it, you can have it.”Explore more on these topicsSportBobsleighTennisFertility problemsIVFUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ngamba, who won thefirst Olympic medal in history for the Refugee Teamat the Paris Games last year, is a sparkling personality and a boxer of vast potential, so it does not take her long to reveal her current favourite.“On my gumshield it says ‘One in 100 Million’ so that’s a nickname I like,” Ngamba says. “It’s linked to the Refugee Team because I am just one in a 100 million refugees from around the world.”‘FA Cup of darts’ keeps grassroots flame alive as big-money era shapes to snuff it outRead moreThe 26-year-old, whocannot return to her home country of Cameroonbecause she is gay, laughs as I try a ring announcer’s introduction of Cindy “One in a 100 Million” Ngamba! “I like it. I might use it because we are special and it’s the only nickname I’ve thought about so far. I’m taking my time but you’ve got to make it relatable to you.”Some commentators have suggested that, at her best, Ngamba resembles a female version of the young Tommy Hearns with her gangly frame and hard-hitting power. She will be even more suited to the pro game and looks a future star. Asked to describe her anticipation before fighting theEuropean welterweight champion Kirstie Bavington, Ngamba says: “I’m excited for this new journey.Once I step in the pro ring everything will be different.”She understands that moving into professional boxing is akin to entering shark-filled waters. “Without doubt. Before I went to the Olympics last year I was told this by my teammates [at GBBoxingwhere she still trains in Sheffield]. Olympians like Karriss Artingstall, Lauren Price, Galal Yafai, Frazer Clarke and Joshua Buatsi warned me. Everyone knows what professional boxing is like.“I’ve sat down with [promoters] and they would sell me the world to the point where I’d be like: ‘Yeah, let’s do it!’ Luckily I had people that wanted the best for me, to protect me. Looking back now I’m like: ‘Wow, everyone in the pros is in it for themselves. They just see you as a payday or what they can get out of you.’“That’s why I decided to turn pro with GB Boxing [she is still trained by her amateur coach, Rob McCracken, who has vast experience of the pro ranks, and supported by the newPodium2Pro venturerun by the British boxing Olympic programme]. They want the best for me. When I had nothing, they were the ones who didn’t look at me as someone they could take things from. They saw me as this girl who has an amazing talent. She has an amazing personality and an amazing story and her goal is to box at the Olympics. They helped me get there. So that’s why I decided to stay with GB Boxing.”View image in fullscreenCindy Ngamba hitting the pads with trainer Rob McCracken. She is staying with GB Boxing as her guide in the professional world after they nurtured her Olympic dream.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianNgamba has lived in Britain for more than 15 years, but she has yet to gain citizenship in this country. GB Boxing supported her, and trained and nurtured her, even when it was obvious Ngamba could make it to the Olympics only as part of the Refugee Team.In a similar way they will help her navigate the bruising terrain of professional boxing – but GB Boxing cannot protect her from the reality that the fight business is now controlled at the highest level by Saudi Arabia.How does she feel about the Saudi stranglehold on boxing?“They really disappoint me. It very much disappoints me but I think Saudi has always been like that. Their law has always been very different compared to European countries. Do I think it’s going to change? I don’t really think so. I don’t think I ever want to go to Saudi until I hear from women saying that they’ve changed their laws. But even if the laws have changed, I will still feel scared for my life, or threatened for my life, if I go there.“Every female boxer should be treated like a boxer. They should never say: ‘Oh, you’re a female and a lesbian so we don’t want you to be part of boxing.’ For me, being part of the LGBTQ+ community and being a female boxer, there’s a high chance that I can be in danger if I go to Saudi. So I would never think about going to Saudi.”Does it concern her that, because elite boxing is now dominated by Saudi Arabia, opportunities for female fighters are severely compromised? “No, because male boxers have always been [considered] higher compared to women. But I think the percentage of females compared to men has got better. The advertising and promotion of female boxing has got a bit better. But we’re not where we want to be. Male boxing has always been at the top because men rule the sport.“As females we’re trying to prove we are boxers too and we have skills, talent, power and all that men have. Females have it – but it’s to do with promotion and the media. They need to be praising female boxing a bit more.”Ngamba looks floored when I ask her if she realises that the Albert Hall show, the night before International Women’s Day, carries advertising for Riyadh Season, which promotes so many men’s fights in Saudi Arabia. “No, I did not know that,” she says quietly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I guess that they have to play their power and they’re taking some of the Sky Sports boxers abroad. But I’m staying out of it. I’m focusing on my boxing. I’m letting Rob McCracken and my team sort it out for me. It’s a very dangerous sport, but you can’t be intimidated by it.”I ask Ben Shalom, the head of Boxxer, the promotional companystaging the “historic” all-women’s bill, why Ngamba and the headline fighters Price and Natasha Jonas were all surprised when I mentioned to them that Riyadh Season is being advertised in conjunction with the Albert Hall show. The promoter pauses before replying: “Riyadh Season sponsor all of our events. There are major changes going on there and they’ve never shown any sign of discrimination against anyone or any of our fighters. It’s the opposite. I think they are trying to modernise their country. If anything, to have them supporting an event like this shows the changes that they are making and what can happen through boxing.”Pressed to explain the Saudis’ involvement in Friday’s promotion, Shalom says: “They’re a sponsor of the event just like BetFred or Everlast. In return for the exposure that their brand will get, just as any sponsor they’ll pay a fee for that exposure.”A referee’s blunder spared Gervonta Davis, but the bloom is off the rose | Thomas HauserRead moreAs for Ngamba’s fear of travelling to Saudi Arabia, Shalom defends his promotional partners’ involvement in boxing: “If anything it shows an intention to change – I truly believe that. I’ve been visiting Saudi over the past year or two and was it ever somewhere that, growing up, I thought I would be going to? Probably not. But the changes that they are trying to make are vast.”Ngamba is far more skilled and talented than Bavington, despite her rival having regained the European welterweight title, but will she be nervous on Friday night? “I always tell myself: ‘If you don’t get nervous you shouldn’t be in the ring.’ It’s how you handle your nerves and I know that, whatever she’s going to bring to the table, I’ll be able to back it up. So I don’t really fuss about it.“If I didn’t feel confident in myself, I wouldn’t have decided to turn pro and to take this [non-title] fight with Bavington. She has loads of experience but I back myself, no matter when and where. I train hard, I work hard. I have a great team. I listen to my coach. I love learning, being with people that have loads of experience, because I learn from them. So I know I will come out on top.”Ngamba has already chosen the music to accompany her ringwalk. “It’s the anthem of the Olympic Refugee Team. I want to keep it authentic and remind everyone of who I am and where I started from. I am a refugee and it helps that the music is good. It’s even got a bit of rapping and it gets the blood pumping.”She smiles again when I say that Friday night will also give her an opportunity to show the Saudis what they have been missing while paying scant attention to female boxers. “Oh yeah!” Ngamba says, her eyes burning with fiery ambition and resolve to highlight her status as a one in a 100 million female fighter.Explore more on these topicsBoxingSaudi Arabia and sportinterviewsShareReuse this content"

ForAston Villaand Tyrone Mings this was a return to the scene of the crime.It was here in November where Mings gifted Club Brugge a penalty afterinexplicably picking up the ballfrom a goal-kick, but this time his biggest intervention was an improbable goalline clearance to prevent a Hans Vanaken header from nestling in Emiliano Martínez’s net and the Belgian champions from assuming control. The cold reality is Villa toiled despite a dream start on their return to Belgium but it is hard to argue a two-goal advantage is not a significant buffer before the second leg next Wednesday.Martin Ødegaard double leads Arsenal’s 7-1 thrashing of PSV EindhovenRead moreUnai Emery acknowledged later that Mings was the good guy this time, Villa’s saviour. Twenty minutes after he somehow contorted his left boot to stop Vanaken’s header from inside the six-yard box dropping in, Villa were basking in a 3-1 victory that puts them in a commanding position to reach theChampions Leaguequarter-finals, where either Liverpool or Paris Saint‑Germain await. The Brugge defender Brandon Mechele, seemingly wary of Ollie Watkins and Marco Asensio lurking in the box, inadvertently diverted Morgan Rogers’s teasing cross past Simon Mignolet and by the end Asensio had added his fifth goal in four games, scoring a penalty after Christos Tzolis chopped down Matty Cash.Emery knew what he was getting when he signed Asensio: a three‑time Champions League winner, for starters, but also a high-pedigree star capable of bending games to his will. Just as Emery was getting hot under the collar on another awkward night in Brugge, the Villa manager booked for voicing his frustrations pitchside, a rare moment of quality snatched this game away from the hosts. Rogers’s cross was tricky and the mere presence of Asensio and Watkins spooked Mechele.View image in fullscreenMarco Asensio celebrates scoring the penalty that sealed a 3-1 win and leaves Club Brugge with a mountain to climb.Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP/Getty ImagesThe locals had not forgotten Mings’s faux pas in the league phase, when Vanaken scored the only goal from the spot. The home supporters cheered Mings’s name when the teams were read aloud before kick‑off and the Villa defender seemingly made a mental note. Only 136 seconds into this match Villa stunned the hosts to take the lead. Mings, of course, was involved. He got above the defender Joel Ordóñez to knock down a dinked Youri Tielemans free-kick and Leon Bailey arrived on to the ball like a flash, charging towards the penalty spot and stroking the ball in with his left foot on the half-volley. Mings could not resist wagging his index finger at the ardent Brugge fans behind the goal. After a freakish defeat last time, this was the fast start they craved.Villa looked primed to build but Brugge responded on 12 minutes, Maxim De Cuyper rolling in an equaliser after Tzolis drove at Axel Disasi, who started at right-back. Martínez then saved well from an unmarked Chemsdine Talbi after the half-hour mark but it was Mings who stopped Brugge from seizing the lead.“We needed our goalkeeper, we needed Tyrone’s ‘save’,” Emery said. “We can remember the match we played before here with Tyrone. This time he saved a [goal with a] really important action. The first experience he had here was not good but today he reacted fantastically. He was focused, serious – saving one action that was a goal. I know the difficulties and how we have these experiences. And we have corrected something from the last match we played here.”Emery’s quadruple substitution shortly after the hour spoke to another pale performance. Cash, Boubacar Kamara, Jacob Ramsey and Asensio entered in place of Disasi, John McGinn, Bailey and Marcus Rashford, who started off the left flank. By that point Raphael Onyedika had sent a shot billowing towards Martínez and, before that, Mings had made an early second-half intervention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pascal Gross did put the ball in the net from close range on the stroke of half-time but his effort was offside.The Germans, who have struggled in the Bundesliga this season and are in 10th place and at risk of missing out on next season's Champions League, eased off after the break.Lille, who failed to break through a solid Dortmund backline for more than an hour, finally succeeded with a quick passing move as an off-balance Haraldsson beat goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Haraldsson is only the second Icelandic player to score in the Champions League knockout rounds.Despite some late pressure, Dortmund failed to carve out any clear chances and then had midfielder Daniel Svensson taken off with a suspected knee injury after Lille's André Gomes stepped on his foot from behind.\"Tough game today and we did not show what we had set out to do,\" said Adeyemi. \"Now we have to do it at their stadium. We had wanted to keep a clean sheet and score as many as possible.\"ReutersPhotograph: Martin Meissner/APWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Asensio had four goals across his previous three appearances, the doubleagainst Cardiff last Fridaybooking Villa’s FA Cup quarter-final spot, and he almost immediately added to his tally. Brugge flew up the other end on the counterattack and went close through Vanaken, only for Mings to stagger towards the Villa goal to divert the ball’s course. A few minutes later the lively Tzolis made a mess of a chance himself from the edge of the six‑yard box after wriggling between Ezri Konsa and Cash. Brugge would be punished for their profligacy.Emery highlighted how Brugge scored three goals in Bergamo to overpower Atalanta in the playoff round but regardless Villa are in the box seat. For Villa, it is now six wins from nine Champions League matches, a fine return back at this level. “We are not in the quarter-final,” insisted Villa’s manager. “There is still 90 minutes to play and we’re ready in case we need extra time and penalties. I know how difficult each match is and how one match can change in 90 minutes. I’m sure the players have experiences of matches like that and we have always to respect our opponent.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAston VillaClub BruggeEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

While the draw is little reward to Liverpool for winning the group stage, Slot believes it is an occasion his players will relish as they continue their pursuit of three trophies in his debut season.“We would have preferred to play against Benfica instead of PSG,” said Slot, who has an injury doubt over Cody Gakpo for the first leg on Wednesday night. “But this is also a great fixture to play and it’s a great stadium to play. If you are playing for Liverpool you want to play big games. We are facing a very strong opponent – they are as well.“We will have to show up in every part of the game and give the best possible performance of the season. It is not easy to press PSG because they go man-for-man all over the pitch. Against Arsenal earlier in the season PSG were not as aggressive as they have been in the last 10-15 games. We have to be the best possible version of ourselves. PSG are one of the best teams in Europe, with so much attacking threat and so much rotation. It will be an interesting game.”The mantle of best team in Europe can be applied to Liverpool with their 13-point lead in the Premier League and place in the Carabao Cup final. Slot, however, believes his side need to win the club’s seventh European crown to confirm that status.“It’s a nice compliment to get but the best team in Europe has to win theChampions Leagueand we are far away from that,” he said. “I think the best team in Europe is still Real Madrid because they won this competition last season. For us, we have to win it before you can say this.”Enrique, who guided PSG to the semi-finals last season, was effusive in his praise of Slot’s impact since succeeding Jürgen Klopp. “Liverpool has one of the best counterattacks in Europe so we will try to keep the ball and be careful not to suffer too much from transitions,” the PSG coach said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’d love to win a trophy too. We’re striving to be at the top table. We’ve got a great coach in Eddie [Howe] so the future is bright.”It could, though, be expensive for some fans after Eales declined to commit to freezing season-ticket prices. “We’re trying to compete with teams that have much bigger revenues so it’s a balancing act. We want to give Eddie the resources to compete but we’re also aware of where we are in the country.”As Eales announced a broadly positive set of 2023-24 accounts he said the club’s progress was being slowed appreciably by the profitability and sustainability rules that allow teams to post collective losses of up to £105m over a three-year cycle.This favours long-established elite clubs with the largest commercial revenue streams and often advantageous geographical locations. A more isolated rival situated in a deprived region such as the north‑east can struggle to catch up even if they are owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.“PSR is really supposed to be about sustainability but it’s a system that favours those with bigger revenues,” said Eales who, after a diagnosis of blood cancer, is “doing well” and working an extended notice period. “We could put funds into an extra account that could show we wouldn’t go bust but the way the rules are now we have to grow incrementally.“The fact we’re in our second Carabao Cup final in three years and two points off a Champions League place show we’re growing but it’s frustrating in the sense that our progress since our takeover [in October 2021] could have been quicker if things were different. PSR in its current form is challenging.”Although they have not signed any regular first-team players for the past three transfer windows, Newcastle seem in a position to restock the squad after overall losses fell to £11.1m in the 12‑month accounting period to 30 June 2024, down from £71.8m the previous year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Given Manchester City command more than double that figure, Newcastle know that, to compete properly with City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham et al they will almost certainly need to move to a new stadium or redevelop St James’ Park. The Saudis are considering detailed plans for both options and a decision is expected shortly.Eales suggested such expansion would mean the club could aim to encourage corporate fans to fly to the north-east on match days. “It would allow us to have more fans in and, while helping make some tickets more affordable, would also enable us to provide that level of hospitality that would be able to perhaps get more people up from London for that high-end market,” he said.There are unconfirmed reports that PIF is buying a 49% stake in Newcastle airport and Eales eyes that option as a gateway for new fans. “If Newcastle airport can grow that would be great for everybody. Anything that helps this region helps the club and vice versa. The more we can put Newcastle on the map, the more jobs and investment we can create here. We’re conscious ofNewcastle Unitedbeing a beacon for the city and the region.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

The home Premier League match against Arsenal will be preceded by a supporter march to Old Trafford, starting at 3.15pm from the Tollgate pub.The 1958 fan group hope it “could be one of the largest ever protests” at United, whose supporters have expressed opposition since the Glazer family completed a leveraged takeover in 2005. The group demanded an end to the family’s ownership and asked supporters “to wear black to symbolise how the club is ‘slowly dying’ due to huge debts, mismanagement and fan exploitation”.Manchester United may terminate lease on London offices to save moneyRead moreSteve Crompton, spokesperson for The 1958, said: “The club is slowly dying before our eyes, on and off the pitch, and the blame lies squarely at the current ownership model. The club is facing financial Armageddon. Debt is the road to ruin.“Sir Matt Busby would be turning in his grave at the current plight of one of the world’s greatest football institutions which is being brought to its knees and in many ways becoming a laughing stock.”A separate protest was organised by the Manchester United Supporters’ Trust at Sunday’s FA Cup fifth-round tie against Fulham. It joined forces with the Fulham Supporters’ Trust to protest against ticket pricing outside Old Trafford, then displayed banners inside the ground as the teams walked out on to the pitch. United, the FA Cup holders, went on tolose that match on penalties, compounding a miserable season with them a lowly 14th in the Premier League.United return to action at Real Sociedad in Thursday’s Europa League last-16 first leg, with that competition providing their last shot at silverware and only realistic route to European qualification. Having accounted for progress to the Champions League knockout phase for years, it is understood that financial modelling for next term includes the prospect of missing out on European football.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ciccarese was speaking to journalists and partners at the league’s American headquarters in New York and standing alongside Serie A’s president, Ezio Simonelli.Philip Billing goes from Bournemouth backup to Napoli hero in title clash | Nicky BandiniRead more“Yes, we would love to do it as the president said; we are working in order to potentially do it, but there are barriers that we need to overcome,” Ciccarese told reporters, citing scheduling concerns such as the clubs’ involvement in midweek European competitions and the potential strain on players. “Who knows, maybe in a window of one to two years potentially we will see the league playing [in the US] if the approvals come.”The path for Serie A to hold league games outside Italy was officially opened last year when the American promotions company Relevent Sports agreed to drop its long-running lawsuit against Fifa over the global federation’s rule barring domestic leagues from playing regular-season matches outside their home territories. Fifa, after being dropped from the suit, agreed to rescind that rule. Many fan groups and some clubs are against the idea of exporting games.“It’s always a race to try to be the trendsetter because then the followers come and the trendsetter is who benefits,” Ciccarese said. “It should be done in a way that makes sense for the club without forgetting the fans … you cannot play a Milano derby in America because the fans in Italy will get very upset. That game has a big meaning in Italy. So we have to play in a way that is respectful of our audience.”Ciccarese also addressed Serie A’s efforts to expand its brand in the US, admitting the Premier League had a considerable head start in that area and was fully embedded in the country’s soccer culture.“The Premier league did an amazing job, especially when we were at the top,” he said, referring to the period in the late 90s and early 2000s when Serie A was at its strongest. In that period, the Premier League signed its first significant US TV deals with ESPN and then Fox Sports, followed by a landmark deal with NBC Sports in 2013, which was renewed in 2022 for a reported $450m a season. NBC’s coverage of the league and willingness to put its games on national broadcast television is widely considered to have been instrumental to the competition’s growth in popularity in the US.Serie A has been broadcast on CBS and Paramount+ in the US since the 2021-22 season, with that relationship extended for a further two seasons last summer.“[The Premier League] started really promoting it and creating the product abroad, so we came a little bit late,” Ciccarese said. “We took a good slip, let’s say like that. But now we want to go fast.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These include grassroots clinics and a more aggressive marketing strategy over the next 18 months to coincide with the Club World Cup and men’s World Cup, which take place in the US this summer and next, respectively.Ciccarese said the language barrier was a factor they were considering, especially considering the prevalence of Spanish among US-based soccer fans. “But don’t underestimate what artificial intelligence can do,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSerie AEuropean club footballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But having overcome their issues in front of goal in spectacular style afterfailing to scorein three of their past four games, the Arsenal manager is hoping this can act as a springboard for the rest of the season as they prepare to face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.“Thank you because it was a special night,” Arteta said of his team’s performance. “It’s obviously given us a lot of joy and confidence and belief. In football, it’s not what we did three days ago or today, it’s going to be what we do tomorrow.“We go to Old Trafford; how we behave, how we play and are we able to win a game. That’s it, enjoy tonight because it was a very impressive performance and an unbelievable score. We deserve that and I’ll take it and keep improving as a team.”On setting the record, he said: “It’s something that hasn’t been done, so it’s great to be part of that. But as a team we want to achieve many other things that are far more important than that. The happiest I am is because we are in a very strong position to go to the next round, which is where we want to be.”Ethan Nwaneri became the third‑youngest goalscorer in the Champions League knockout stages with Arsenal’s second and now needs one more to match Wayne Rooney’s and Michael Owen’s record by a 17-year-old before his 18th birthday on 21 March. “I don’t think that he needs any pushing,” Arteta said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

George said he was blindsided by the England head coach but after receiving advice from his inner circle – including the Saracens director, Mark McCall, Owen Farrell, and his family – he has set his sights on a fourth World Cup, revealing the cricketer Joe Root is his inspiration.George was installed as captain for the 2023Six Nationsand despite a difficult run of results in his year in charge – England won five of their 12 Tests – he was a hugely popular leader, both within the squad and among supporters.Carling questions calibre of England coaching staff and ‘sensitive’ playersRead moreBorthwick’s decision to turn to Maro Itoje came out of the blue, with George informed the day before England’s squad for the championship was announced. Compounding matters, the 34-year-old hooker sustained a hamstring injury in Saracens’ Champions Cup match against Castres later that week, ruling him out of England’s training camp in Girona as well as theiropening defeat against Ireland in Dublin.It was during that period that George went soul-searching but, as he prepares to win his 100th England cap against Italy on Sunday, he cites the manner Root has flourished at the crease since losing the Test captaincy to Ben Stokes in 2022 as proof that deposed captains can continue to make an impact at international level.“It was really challenging, it was really difficult,” said George, who is now a vice-captain along with Ellis Genge. “That hurt, it really did and the first thing on my mind was: ‘Is that me?’ But at the same time, I have really good people around me, speaking to my old man [Ian], my wife [Katie], you understand what is important. Some of the best times of my life have been playing rugby for England, I love playing rugby for England.“It wasn’t a two-way conversation [with Steve], it was very one-way. I don’t think you can plead your case like a breakup. I wasn’t expecting it but at the same time I understood it. Steve has always been very clear with me and very honest and I have worked with coaches before who haven’t been. I really value that with Steve and the way he did it.View image in fullscreenJamie George is fully supportive of his successor, Maro Itoje.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/Reuters“I was gutted, I was disappointed, I felt like I had a lot more to give but at the same time his decision and who he has picked in Maro, is a fantastic decision.“When I was reflecting on it I took a bit of inspiration fromJoe Root. I tried to see other sports where it has happened; has it worked in any other sports, has it worked in our sport? I saw it a little bit with Chris Robshaw post-2015.“I look at Joe Root now and the freedom he has and the way he has kicked on and become the best batsman in the world arguably.“That is hugely inspiring and I see that as the sort of trajectory I aspire to be like, the way he has reacted to it I see it as a huge positive. It has freed him up and allowed him to play even better than he already was. That is how I would love it to be and I am feeling a bit of that.”George returned from injury ahead of schedule to win his 98th cap off the benchagainst France– turning in an impressive cameo with a memorable line-break – before following suitagainst Scotlandlast time out. His leadership has proved invaluable in harness with Itoje and he hopes to extend his Test career to the 2027 World Cup in Australia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That will be the case as long as I lace my boots up, I want to be helping and contributing any way I can for England.“I am ambitious. I want to be the best I possibly can be. I want to start the game but I’m not going to throw my toys out the pram and not give everything of myself if I’m on the bench. It’s easier to make an impact and be seen coming off the bench.“I play best when I’m vocal and I add to the team when I take charge of huddles and Maro wants me to be able to do that. It frees Maro up a little bit if he’s got decisions to be made with the referee, he needs vice-captains and people to take charge of other people and a different perspective.“I want to play for England as long as I can, the World Cup is definitely an ambition of mine and I would love to put my name in the hat for another Lions tour and hopefully my performances over the next couple of weeks will put my name in the conversation.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2025Joe RootSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Their playing group has now effectively stopped training in the run-up to the game against Castleford on Friday.Salford insist the delay in funding is due to a seven-figure sum coming from overseas. But the RFL has decided to take immediate action, reimposing the cap restrictions on the club. It means their head coach, Paul Rowley, will be limited once again to players worth a total of £1.2m of their £2m squad.Salford’s new administrators have been ordered to attend a meeting on Wednesday morning to explain how they plan to resolve the matter. It appears unlikely restrictions will be removed in time for the game on Friday and Salford are winless from their opening three league games.The governing body said: “The RFL special measures committee have determined at their meeting earlier today that the sustainability cap of £1.2m that was imposed on the club in February, and lifted ahead of their BetfredSuper Leagueround two fixture, will be reimposed immediately.“In addition, Salford Red Devils have been asked to update and explain to the RFL’s special measures committee and representatives from Rugby League Commercial at a meeting on Wednesday morning the current position regarding non-payment of staff, and how this will be rectified as well as a wider update on the club’s financial sustainability.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In this week’s Techscape: the cost of Elon Musk’s cost-cutting, the emotional shutdown of Skype, and a new documentary on immigration and surveillance.Elon Musk’s cost savings will be very expensive for the USOn Saturday, Elon Musk took aim at his next target in the federal government: the technology division of the General Services Administration (GSA), which the Guardian was among the firstto report.The GSA, according to itswebsite, “manages federal property and provides contracting options for government agencies”. Its tech division was known as 18F – and was made up of some 90 employees, many of them software engineers dedicated to streamlining the federal bureaucracy (a task that doesn’t sound too far off what Musk has claimed he’s trying to do with Doge).You may not know about 18F, but have likely heard of its most famous product: free tax-filing software. The sub-agency created IRS Direct File, a program that aimed to resolve one of the most frustrating and relatable examples of the excesses of bureaucracy: having to fork over cash to be able to give the government money.Still, Musk wasn’t a fan. He tweeted a few weeks ago that he had “deleted” IRS Direct File, though it remained available up until now. The fate of the software is not clear. Because of Musk’s work with Doge, more people in the US are now likely to spend money that they would not have had to spend before he arrived in Washington. His efficiency efforts will personally cost American taxpayers.It’s just one of myriad ways that Americans will end up footing a bill for Musk’s so-called cost-saving.My colleagueMichael Sainatoreports:Donald Trump’s administration could rack up a “monumental” bill and is breaking the law by firing government workers on spurious grounds, according to a top labor lawyer.Officials have cited “poor performance” when terminating thousands of federal workers. In many cases it’s not true, according to employees embroiled in the blitz, many of whom are now seeking legal advice.Suzanne Summerlin, a labor attorney, summed things up: “These firings they’re conducting without following the law will result in hundreds of thousands of former federal employees being owed back pay, plus interest, plus benefits, plus attorney fees,” she said. “When the bill comes it will be monumental.”Read the full story.It’s a deja vu in Muskworld. After Musk acquired Twitter and fired the majority of its employees and its entire executive slate, he let both groups claim their severance in court if they so pleased. They sued.Bloomberg reports that Musk has lost all his battles over severance with former Twitter employees so far: “Four ex-Twitter workers have prevailed in a recent series of closed-door arbitration proceedings over claims they were illegally denied severance, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg News.“Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer representing former employees in arbitrations, wrote in the memo that the 20 cases she’s won so far have cost the company at least twice the amount of contested severance pay because the awards have also included interest, arbitration expenses and legal fees. She’s representing more than 2,000 former employees in legal fights against Musk.”Read the full story.More on Musk …‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Elon Musk’s fascist-style salutesTrump cabinet flunkies hail wannabe Caesar and Elon, his oligarch palShare your memories of SkypeView image in fullscreenThe Skype app logo.Photograph: Sheldon Cooper/Sopa/LightRocket via Getty ImagesMicrosoftannounced on Friday that it would shutter Skype. Around for more than 20 years, the product was once so ubiquitous and original that its name became a genericized verb for calling someone via video.More than most pieces of technology, Skype evoked emotion. It was a piece of culture as well as technology. There were few other recognizable programs for video calling, an action for which an everyday person in a certain era would only use Skype.

But many of the tools and tactics the administration is using have been used by every administration since at least 2004.A new timely documentary shot over the course of the first Trump administration, calledBorderland: The Line Within, brings some clarity to the ways the “border industrial complex” was being weaponized in Trump’s first term as president and how it affected asylum seekers and immigrants working in the system. Specifically, the documentary, directed by Pamela Yates and Paco de Onis of Skylight Pictures, follows the journey of immigrants turned activists Kaxh Mura’l and Gabriella Castañeda.Mura’l is an Indigenous Maya who left Guatemala, where he was an environmental land defender, and Castaneda is a mother who lost her Daca status during the Covid pandemic. When Mura’l was released after months of detention, he was obligated to wear an ankle monitor operated by a private company called BI Inc,which the Guardian has reported on extensively. He said even though he was no longer detained, he was still not free.The documentary focused on the companies and corporations profiting from the surveillance of immigrants in the US. A group of data scientists, who worked at Columbia at the time, looked at the many billions of dollars awarded to corporations by the Department of Homeland Security, whether for privately run detention centers or the ankle monitor system. The film got across a point we try to make in much of our reporting: There is an entire industry vying for extremely lucrative contracts to enable the US government to track, detain and deport immigrants. Just this week, the largest private contractor for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it isplanning for a surveillance boomas Trump’s migrant crackdown continues.In a Q&A with the Guardian staff, Yates said she believes the cruelty of the system is part of the point because it creates an environment of fear that might discourage immigrants from fighting for their rights. “People who are undocumented in the US have that fear inside of themselves … that they can be captured and deported,” Yates said. “And I think the cruelty amps that fear up.”The wider TechScapeUS national security director condemns UK request for Apple data ‘backdoor’UK watchdog to investigate TikTok and Reddit over use of children’s dataTrump administration retreats in fight against Russian cyber threatsApple shareholders vote against ending DEI program amid Trump crackdown‘I want him to be prepared’: why parents are teaching their gen Alpha kids to use AIGhost hunting, pornography and interactive art: the weird afterlife of Xbox KinectExplore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterElon MuskSkypeTelecomsSurveillancenewslettersShareReuse this content"

Though few ordinary Chinese pay much attention to goings-on inside the Great Hall of the People, the imposing 1950s modernist building that flanks the western edge of Tiananmen Square, the ripple effects of this week’s conclave can be felt across the city.Security is heightened. Extra uniformed personnel have been deployed to stand guard on Beijing’s bridges – lest anyone attempt a stunt inspired byPeng Lifa’s protest at Sitong Bridgeahead of the 20th party congress in 2022. Guards at busy subway stations subject commuters to random scans of their identification cards.Virtual private networks – apps used to tunnel through the firewall of internet censorship – slow down, as the authorities try to tighten their grip on the exchange of information with the outside world. It is imperative to the Communist party that the parallel sessions of the “Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference”, an advisory body, and the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s rubber-stamp parliament, run smoothly. Put together, the meetings are known asthe Two Sessions, and represent the most important annual event in China’s political calendar.From Beijing, the outside world appears to be in flux. China’s claim to be the beacon of stability in a chaotic world is being bolstered by events. The presidents of the US and Ukraine aretrading verbal blowslive on television; the US-backed ceasefire deal in Gaza is on thebrink of collapse.China, save for a few headlines about tariffs, is staying out of the news. The tariffs themselves are generally far from the public consciousness, despite the fact that Chinaimposed another round of countermeasureson the US on Tuesday, after Donald Trump doubled duties on Chinese goods to 20%.The trade war “won’t influence me”, said Wang Zichen, an 18-year-old salesperson working in Beijing’s upmarket Chaoyang district. The US and China “are just having some problems and need a solution … [the US] is a friendly country”. Wang is more interested in hustling for his next customer. Business is slow. Total sales of consumer goods in Chaoyang dropped by 4% in 2024, while sales of commercial and residential property fell by 10% and 13% respectively, when measured in square metres.China was supposed to roar back from the pandemic as consumer spending was unleashed, but most people on the street agree that hasn’t happened. Real estate prices are falling. Millennials and Gen-Z workers are struggling to find work and even the middle-aged, including people with their own young children, are sitting at home without jobs. They, like the younger generations, aretangping,or “lying flat”: choosing passivity in a society that doesn’t feel like it is rewarding hard work. Young parents even talk ofkenlao,or “eating the old” – living off their elders who have healthy state pensions.This kind ofeconomic nihilismis exactly what Beijing wants to combat. High on the agenda for this week’s NPC will be fiscal stimulus. In December, the Central Economic Work Conference, an economic planning session convened by the CCP politburo, stressed the need to stimulate consumption and stabilise economic growth.When the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, delivers the government work report at the NPC’s opening session on Wednesday, analysts will be watching closely for the GDP target for 2025, expected to be 5%, and for details on the directions set by the CCP at the end of last year.With the first shots of the US-China trade war fired since that December meeting, Beijing is under pressure to find ways to shield its economy from the impact of tariffs. In 2024, China’s economy reached its GDP target with the help of an end-of-year export boom. Exports to the US in December increased by 15.6%. With tariffs back on the menu, economic growth built on exports will be harder to pull off in 2025.China’s economic boom was built on infrastructure and policies that prioritised GDP growth above all else. Then it turned to manufacturing, becoming the “factory of the world”. Now China’s leaders want to pivot the economy towards “new quality productive forces”, a phrase coined by China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in 2023. That means focusing on investment in innovation and hi-tech sectors.And in 2025, that meansDeepSeek. The upstart Chinese AI company took the world by storm in January when it released an AI model that emulated the sophistication of leading American competitors, seemingly at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek’s debutwiped a record $1tn off US tech stocksas investors reeled from the revelation that the US may not keep its leading position in AI for much longer.DeepSeek, a private research firm bankrolled by a hedge-fund entrepreneur namedLiang Wenfeng, achieved its success without state backing. But the state has since embraced Liang and his company. Last month, Xi held a rare in-person meeting with tech leaders in Beijing, with Liangreportedly present.While Liang is burnishing his connections in the capital, his company is everywhere. The technology giant Baidu is integratingDeepSeekwith its own large language model, Ernie, with DeepSeek already being embedded into Baidu’s apps. Beijing commuters consult DeepSeek’s chatbot while huddling on crowded subway carriages.Western diplomats report that Chinese officials are mentioning DeepSeek’s potential at every possible opportunity. The local public transport authority in Shenzhen, China’s southern tech hub, has started using DeepSeek in its AI-powered customer service agent, and claims to have increased efficiency by 50% as a result.There is no doubting a spring in the step of Chinese policymakers tasked with promoting Xi’s beloved “new quality productive forces”. The delegates to this week’s Two Sessions will have to hope that such optimism in the corridors of power can spread on to the streets of Beijing, and beyond.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificDeepSeekArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

These highly nutritious Amazonian superfoods are rich in antioxidants and vitamins, and serve as a main source of income for farmers in Silva’s area. However, the lack of electricity to refrigerate the fruit makes it hard to sell their produce.Silva’s fruit-growing operation is located in the village of Boa Frente, in Novo Aripuanã municipality, one ofBrazil’s most energy-poor regions, where there is only one diesel-powered electricity generator working for a few hours a day.The 17 families in the community pay for the diesel, but because of the high price, everyone agrees to use the generator only between 6pm and 10pm. This is also the only time they can communicate with the outside world – the region has no mobile phone connection, only satellite internet.“Power is supplied for just four hours a night. The motor is switched off and only switched back on the following night,” says Silva, 72, a rural health worker and fruit-grower who has lived in the area since he was born.“I would have a much higher income if we had power to preserve the cupuaçu pulp. Our community is a big producer of tucumã, but the lack of power prevents conservation.”More than 1.3 million Brazilians still live, like Silva, with little or no electricity. Even though it has one of theworld’s cleanest power grids, the country has a vulnerability: its reliance on hydroelectric power, which causes fluctuations in power generation and blackouts in times of severe drought.View image in fullscreenBrazil has one of the cleanest energy grids in the world, but is heavily reliant on hydropower, which can lead to blackouts in drought conditions.Photograph: Jeff BotegaYet Brazil is attracting the attention of big datacentre companies, which consume huge amounts of energy. According to theBrazilian Data Centre Association(ABDC), 46 new datacentres are either under construction or being planned across the country. There are already 60 centres in operation.By using cooling systems with excessive water use, these companies consume more than small citiesVinícius OliveiraThe rush to build datacentres is part of the growing digitalisation of the Brazilian economy as large multinationals seek more data storage and processing for cloud platforms, apps, and critical private and government services.Brazil has become a hub to meet growing demand in Latin America for streaming, e-commerce and AI apps, as expanding regional server capacity is critical to minimising delays in transferring data.“If all the data was stored solely in the US, communication would be inefficient and delayed,” says João Xavier, director of institutional relations at ABDC.Rodrigo Pastl Pontes, monitoring manager at Brazil’sNational Confederation of Industry, says the need to expand the number of datacentres is closely related to “Industry 4.0” – the integration of technologies to make manufacturing more intelligent, automated and interconnected.View image in fullscreenAn impression of Scala Data Centers’ planned 700-hectare AI City in Rio Grande do Sul. ‘This is our response to the demand for artificial intelligence,’ the firm said.Illustration: Scala Data Centers“Industry 4.0 offers flexibility that meets customer requirements in real time, allowing the company to reorganise constantly,” says Pontes. “Securedatacentres are essential for this.”One studyput Brazil’s Industry 4.0 market at $1.77bn(£1.40bn) in 2022 and expects it to reach $5.6bn by 2028.With an eye on local and global markets, as well as its largely renewable power grid, Amazon andMicrosofthave announced new investments in Brazilian datacentres.Amazon plans to invest 10.1bn reais(£1.35bn) in expanding its datacentres and infrastructure over the next 10 years. The company claims to have established solar and windfarm projects with the capacity to match its energy consumption in Brazil – enough to supply 100,000 homes.View image in fullscreenItaipu hydroelectric dam in Foz do Iguaçu. Though Brazil has vast hydropower potential, recent droughts have underlined its vulnerability to the climate crisis.Photograph: Bloomberg/GettyMicrosoft is planning to invest R$14.7bn in the country. With datacentres in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the company has signed a deal with the energy company AES Brasil to be supplied for 15 years from a Rio Grande do Norte windfarm.Campaigners and experts say the problem is that implementing new energy projects, even renewable ones, could harm local communities just as the country needs to adapt its power grid to the climate crisis.Vinícius Oliveira, a specialist at theEnergy and Environment Institute, says: “The impact of datacentres depends on where they are installed and on the type of energy the Brazilian power grid will need to meet the load demanded.“We may have environmental impacts in soil, deforestation, building road access. Native flora will be eliminated. We may have real-estate speculation, with land becoming more expensive and families being displaced.” Oliveira also anticipates greater demand for water, as datacentres generally require vast amounts to cool servers.View image in fullscreenOsório windfarm in Rio Grande do Sul. Demand for power is rising so fast that small nuclear reactors are now being considered.Photograph: Alamy“By using cooling systems with excessive water use, these companies consume more than small cities,” he says, stressing that better infrastructure for distribution and power generation will also be required.“This level of investment may affect energy rates,” he adds. “In the end, the consumers bear the cost.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Projections suggestBrazil’s electricity demand will grow by more than 30% by 2050.Experts fear that datacentres’ high water consumption will raise pressure on the power grid, as hydroelectric plants supply about half of all power. Lower water levels in reservoirs raise the chances of blackouts and increase demand for pricier and more pollutingthermal power plants, fired by oil, gas and coal.Incidents such as the 2001 water crisis, which caused rationing, and the severe 2014-15 drought, when reservoirs reached record lows, show how a lack of rainfall can threaten the national power supply.View image in fullscreenItajá in Goiás during a blackout last year.

In a statement, it said: “The growth of the datacentre sector in Brazil shows the country’s capacity to become a technological hub in South America, driven by a robust and predominantly renewable power grid.”Mexico’s datacentre industry is booming – but are more drought and blackouts the price communities must pay?Read moreBy 2026,global datacentre power demandis projected to reach up to 1,050 terawatt-hours – equivalent to aboutfour times the UK’s annual electricity consumption. This has prompted greater interest in alternative energy sources such as small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), as seen in theplan by Alphabet, Google’s parent company, to use them in the US.According to Raul Lycurgo, president ofthe state-owned company Eletronuclear, nuclear power can meet Brazil’s needs. “Nuclear is the only [power source] that does not generate greenhouse gases,” he says.But the idea faces opposition due to high capital costs and concerns about how to manage radioactive waste. “Countries with no alternatives can afford to use a more expensive energy,” says Ricardo Lima, an energy consultant. “We have much cheaper alternatives than nuclear – we have solar, wind, hydroelectric.”Energy has been an issue as theclimate crisis increasingly tests the Brazilian power grid.

A study using theMultidimensional Energy Poverty Indexindicated that11% of Brazilian households lived in energy povertyin 2018 – a percentage rising to 16% in rural areas.View image in fullscreenElaine Santos. ‘People lose food and medication,’ she says. ‘The shortages create tension’Even in São Paulo, the country’s largest metropolis, residents face increasingly frequent blackouts. Elaine Santos, a researcher in energy poverty at the University of São Paulo, faces the problem herself, as she lives in Santo André, a suburb of the city.“People lose food and their medication; the bakery closes,” she says of the power cuts. “The shortages create tension, as everyone knows they will have to cope with their losses alone in neighbourhoods where people live in extremely vulnerable conditions.”Santos believes the tech companies must look at the local effects caused by their growing share of the country’s power supply.“If they are going to build datacentres where people don’t even have access to power, the companies need to provide compensation,” she argues. “Since Brazil is being sold, the compensation must be robust.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanInternetEnergy efficiencyAccess to energyEnergyAmazonMicrosoftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One way to save money is to pay for only the speed you need. For most households a speed of 100Mbps is likely to be enough, although it depends on the number of people who will use the internet at the same time, the kinds of devices you use, whether you play online games and the services you require.For instance, the programmes in HD from BBC’siPlayer stream at up to 5MbpswhileNetflix requires at least 15Mbpsfor its highest-quality 4K streams. Bear in mind that any devices such as computers running updates or security cameras will take up some of the bandwidth, so add a little headroom on to your calculations.Watch out, though, for slow upload speeds, as many lower-cost packages can be hamstrung by these, and they are often overlooked when comparing deals. Zoom calls, for instance, requireup to 4Mbps uploadfor full quality just on their own while Ring cameras needup to 2Mbps each.Try your current providerView image in fullscreenUswitch is one of a myriad of comparison websites that can help you.Photograph: Sam Oaksey/AlamyMany providers raise the price of your service when your contract ends and this is where haggling can pay off.“Some providers have a reputation for being more willing to haggle to keep your business, but this can vary depending on your length of contract, previous service issues, what you want from your next deal and other factors,” says Max Beckett from the comparison site Uswitch. “Your bargaining position will be stronger near the end of your contract as you can leave for another provider, which your current one will naturally want to avoid.”Use price comparison sites to see what other deals are available and then ring or chat with your provider. Tell it you are looking for better value on your current service, say that the price it is asking is simply too much and ask what is the best deal it can offer.Be polite at all times, but don’t take the first offer at face value. Say you are thinking of quitting your contract or switching to another provider. This will lead to you being transferred to a customer retention team that typically has the power to offer the best deals to keep you from leaving.If you don’t get an acceptable deal on your first attempt you don’t have to commit there and then. Say you will have to talk it over with the other members of your household, then try again at another time or via another contact method if your provider has multiple routes, such as online chat as well as phone support or via social media. Consider upgrading or downgrading your speed, which may reduce your costs, particularly if your provider has an incentive to move customers to newer plans or technology.Note that some, including Virgin Media, are moving away from human operators offering the best deals and provide better prices via their automated online accounts instead. Check for renewal deals a couple of months ahead of time and see if they improve as the end of your contract nears.Switch the account holderIf your current provider won’t give you a better deal and there are no other options, another member of your household can take out a new contract to bag introductory deals.Simply cancel your broadband contract and have them apply for a new one at the same address. The snag is that you may have some down time. Some providers allow new connection orders at the same address once the existing subscriber has given notice to cancel their plan, switching over at the day of termination. But others only open up to new contracts at an address after the existing service has ended.Move to a new providerSwitching to another company is a good way of getting a better deal if multiple providers serve your address. TheOne Touch Switch serviceshould make sure you have a minimum of downtime between your old and new provider automatically, though it is a relatively new service which has had some teething problems.Check theBetter Internet DashboardorLocal Broadband Informationby ThinkBroadband to see which providers are likely to be available. Use comparison sites such as Uswitch, Comparethemarket, Confused or similar to see what offers are available. Check cashback sites for money back or voucher offers andother cashback services, such as those provided by credit cards.Note that comparison or cashback sites do not include local fibre providers, which may offer cheaper connections, and that big providers may also offer different deals to customers who go direct.Change to a social tariffIf you receive certain government pension, universal credit or other benefits you may be entitled to a social tariff, which is a lower cost plan made available by some providers from as little as £12 a month.BT,Now,Sky,VirginandVodafoneoffer social tariffs nationally, with varying eligibility requirements and speeds available. Some local providers,such as Hyperoptic, also offer social tariffs so it is worth looking around for the best speed and deals.Bundle with phone, mobile and TVIf you also have a home phone, mobile phone, pay-TV or other services, bundling them with your broadband can work out much cheaper than paying for them all separately. It simplifies your various connections to one bill and can offer faster speeds for less money than broadband on its own.But bundling removes some of the flexibility for switching should you ever want to, and narrows your options to the main providers. Be careful that you don’t end up taking out more services than you need through upselling.Or hang up the landlineView image in fullscreenBuying internet without a home phone can save you as much as £30 a year in line rental.Photograph: Tony Dunn/AlamyModern broadband does not need a phone line any more, so if you no longer use your home phone then buying internet without it can save you as much as £30 a year in line rental plus the cost of your calling plan depending on your current package.Use your own routerSome broadband packages include a charge for a wifi router system, particularly those that promise “whole-home wifi” or similar, with multiple wifi nodes that mesh together to spread your internet over a larger area.Buying your own wifi system can work out cheaper than paying for one from your service provider over the long term. Mesh systems capable of covering most homes start at about £100 and can replace or be plugged into your existing router easily. You may also get better coverage and faster wifi speeds.Switch to 5G/satelliteIf your fixed-line providers are limited, expensive or slow,5Gor satellite broadband might offer an alternative.Broadband over 5G is delivered using the same signal as your phone, but using a router inside your house. It is only available in certain areas and requires strong signal to work reliably, but EE, Three and Vodafone all offer the service, with the cheapest plans starting at £21 a month.Multiplesatellite broadbandproviders operate in the UK, offering fast services to places others can’t reach. Brdy has some of the cheapest plans starting at £29.90 a month while Starlink starts at £75. Both providers can have fairly hefty setup or equipment costs, depending on the plan. Speeds can reach up to 200Mbps, but satellite broadband has higher latency than fixed-line – that is, it takes longer for it to respond – and so may not be suitable for online gaming and similar usage.Explore more on these topicsBroadbandMoney hacksInternetConsumer affairsHousehold bills5GTelecomsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a 14-year-old gamer, this was a chance to play the latest titles and see some cool new joysticks, but I was also desperate to visit one particular exhibitor: the publisher Newsfield, home of the wildly popular games mags Crash and Zzap!64. By the time I arrived there was already a long queue of kids at the small stand and most of them were waiting to have their show programmes signed by reigning arcade game champion and Zzap reviewer, Julian Rignall. As an ardent subscriber, I can still remember the thrill of standing in that line, the latest copy of the mag clutched in my sweaty hands. I wouldn’t feel this starstruck again until I met Sigourney Weaver a quarter of a century later.It turns out I’m not the only one who remembers that day. In his wonderful new book, TheGamesof a Lifetime, Rignall himself recalls the shock of being swamped by fans. “We just didn’t expect anything like that,” he writes. “I had no idea readers would be so interested in us. But I loved it.”I’m not sure he should have been so surprised, though. Back in the mid-80s, the boom era of the C64 and ZX Spectrum home computers, magazines such as Crash, Zzap and Computer & Video Games were the only sources of news and opinion about new games. At the time, information about game developers was scarce, so magazine reviewers, with their photos plastered in every issue, were the stars of the industry, the social media influencers of the era.View image in fullscreen‘It really was Dickensian’ … Zzap!64 magazine.Photograph: Chris Daw /Bitmap BooksFor me, what’s most interesting about Rignall’s book, which tracks his career from winning seaside arcade tournaments to editing magazines, working in game development and becoming editorial director at mammoth video game site IGN, is the insight it gives into what went on behind the scenes of 80s games mags. As a kid, I imagined lush, hi-tech publishing companies in cool modernist buildings. But Zzap!64 began in a tiny rented office in Yeovil. “We were all in one room, with a couple of C64s in the broom cupboard,” says Rignall. “Video game publishing was always low rent, but in those early days it really was Dickensian.”It turns out things weren’t much better at the major magazine companies. When Rignall got a job on C&VG in 1988, he moved from the relatively small Newsfield to publishing giant Emap, housed in a vast building in Farringdon in London that also accommodated Commodore User and Sinclair User, each mag on a separate floor. As he recalls, “it was a dusty shithole with typewriters, stinky carpets and shabby interior fittings that hadn’t been updated since the 1970s. Oh, and ashtrays filled with dog ends were everywhere.”Matt Bielby, who would go on to launch legendary games mags SuperPlay and PC Gamer, was a junior writer on C&VG before moving to Dennis Publishing to join Your Sinclair. “Dennis was actually more dingy and smoky than Emap,” he says. “It was in multiple smaller buildings in the roads north of Oxford Street at the Tottenham Court Road end, and [we] initially shared a room with Computer Shopper, with everyone on top of each other, and kit stashed all over in dangerous teetering piles … I initially had to share a desk, so one of us hovered awkwardly around, totally in the way, while the other sat down and did some writing, and every hour or so we swapped.”In the mid-80s, Your Sinclair was one of the key proponents of a new style of irreverent and personality-led games journalism. While early home computer mags featured programming tips and articles about printers and word processing software, these new publications were unselfconsciously games-focused. “My inspiration came from Smash Hits and Just Seventeen,” recalls Your Sinclair’s founding editor Teresa Maughan. “They had a strong tone of voice and made their writers visible – so very deliberately we had cartoons of our reviewers in the mag and everyone could express their personality so readers would feel they had a connection with us.”That connection could sometimes go a little far. “I remember getting all sorts of weird stuff through the mail,” says Maughan. “Someone once sent me their toenails.”Like Smash Hits, Your Sinclair developed its own intricate language and in-jokes, creating daft photo stories in the style of the Jackie and Blue Jeans girls’ mags, and famously cover-mounting a lawn-mowing simulator programmed by the mag’s writer Duncan Macdonald. Readers were active participants and their letters and art became a vital element of the editorial. “By the time I launched Mean Machines in the very early 90s, that mag was absolutely 100% designed around interactivity,” says Rignall. “We had letters pages, Q+A pages, an editorial page that was basically proto-memes before the term was invented, and we encouraged readers to send in crazy pics, photos, drawings, whatever. We were trying to create something that felt like a club run by your mates.”View image in fullscreenMulti-format forever … Computer & Video Games magazinePhotograph: Chris Daw/Bitmap BooksWorking against them however was an archaic magazine production process. This was the era just before desktop publishing software, so the whole system was analogue. “We’d type our stuff into an Apricot proto-PC, save it to disk and take it down to the typesetters,” says Rignall. “They would print out the galleys (the print-quality text), which would then be cut up with scissors and stuck to layout pages with glue along with pics and all the other design elements.”Taking screenshots was an art in itself. When I started at Edge magazine in 1995 the process was already digital: we had a program that could capture screenshots from a console which we’d connect to a Mac via a purpose built video card. But that wasn’t the case in the 80s. “We’d take screenshots by positioning a film camera in front of a freshly cleaned TV screen and shooting pics directly off that,” says Rignall. “We basically put blackout curtains over the windows in the games room so we could turn out the lights and create a dark room. It was tricky as you had to run the camera at <1/25 of a second to avoid a refresh bar across the screenshot. That slow shutter speed was OK when a game had a pause mode, otherwise you’d get horrible screen blur.”Games mag production was, in short, a time-consuming slog, and with small, young teams producing dozens of reviews a month, chaotic too. “You can understand why mid to late 80s magazines were absolutely rife with errors,” says Rignall. “Typos, wrong information, text in the wrong places, stuff missing, miscoloured items … you name it. The process was absolutely shambolic.”But in some ways, the chaos was part of it. Games mags pushed publishing tech to its limits and when the digital era arrived they were often the publications that made the most innovative use of programs such as PageMaker and Quark Xpress. Maughan recalls launching Zero in 1989: “I wanted to to be more sophisticated than the average games mag. It was more glossy, it was very design – we won European magazine of the year award two years running.”Magazines were there at the furnace of video game culture, providing a glimpse into a burgeoning new world. “It was a very tight industry - everyone new everyone,” says Maughan. “There was a healthy rivalry. We did a lot of telephone calls with developers, or we’d go round to their houses and end up interviewing them in their bedrooms.”View image in fullscreen‘100% designed around interactivity’ … Mean Machines magazine.Photograph: Chris Daw/Bitmap BooksBy the end of the 1980s, however, the focus was shifting from home computers to consoles, and readers wanted info directly from the source: Japan. “The first person to really start writing about Japanese stuff for UK folks (in 1987) was Tony Takoushi, who kicked off the Mean Machines column in CVG that I inherited a year later,” says Rignall. “I discovered a Japanese bookshop near the Emap office in 1988 that sold games mags, and that was massive. I had little idea what they were saying until we found a translator a month or two later, but I could see the screenshots and work out what the games were about.”Rignall’s book is effectively a memoir through the lens of games, looking at how titles from Battlezone to Horizon Forbidden West shaped ideas of what interactive entertainment could be, for both players and journalists. By the time I joined the industry, it felt more stable, more professional. Future Publishing was based in beautiful buildings in Bath – Edge shared Beaufort House, a Georgian building that had once been a pub, with titles such as Super Play and GamesMaster. It was a wild time, with lovely magazines, but we owed our whole ethos, our working methods and our humour to the anarchic mags that came before, which set the tone and forged relationships with readers and game makers.Maughan remembers it fondly. “I once went on a press trip with MicroProse,” she says. “It was for a Tom Clancy flight simulator. They invited 10 journos and we all got taken up in a light aircraft by [MicroProse co-founder and ex fighter pilot] Wild Bill Stealey to do loop-the-loops. We went up one at a time each carrying a sick bag. There were lots of champagne breakfast launches on boats … And, God, there was so much camaraderie on the YS team. We used to play games into the early hours. I’ve never laughed so much. It felt like the beginning of something.”The Games of a Lifetime is out now, published by Bitmap BooksExplore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago, each day that Kyiv held out was a victory. The west rallied to Ukraine’s support at equally remarkable speed.Now, as the Trump administration turns upon the victim, and embraces the aggressor, Europe is accelerating nascent plans to bolster Ukraine and pursue security independence. Trump allies blame Friday night’s extraordinary Oval Office confrontation between Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Donald Trump and JD Vance for the shockinghalt to all US military aid. Others suspect that the administration was seeking a pretext for the suspension. Mr Zelenskyypledgedon Tuesday to “work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts” andexpressed gratitude for his first-term approval of Javelin missile defence systems sales.That may or may not be enough. The suspension concluded a fortnight in which Mr Trump attacked Mr Zelenskyy as a “dictator”, the US sided with Russia against western allies at the UN, and the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,suspendedoffensive cyber operations against Moscow. There are reports that the US is preparing plans forloosening the economic pressureon Russia – even as itimposes punitive tariffson allies. Little wonder the Kremlincrowsthat Washington “largely coincides with our vision”. Vladimir Putin hasreportedly offered to mediateUS-Iran nuclear talks. Observers were braced for further developments in the US president’saddress to Congresson Tuesday.Analysts suggest that Ukraine’s forces should be able to continue fighting at their current rate for a few months if US aid does not resume, depending on what it has stockpiled. Though it is far less dependent on the US than three years ago, key elements like Patriot air defence missiles will be hard to replace. If US logistical and intelligence assistance and Elon Musk’s Starlink’s services were suspended, those would be further punishing blows.Mr Trump is in a hurry – hence his angrythreatthat Mr Zelenskyy “won’t be around very long” if he doesn’t cut a deal. This came after the Ukrainian president suggested on Sunday that the end of the war was “very, very far away”. Yet he has also squandered leverage he might have exerted on Moscow before reaching the table. He has emboldened Russia to pursue further territorial gains, especially if it can shape a deal with the USbefore a ceasefire.The US has alreadyunderminedcentral pillars of Sir Keir Starmer’s approach – maintaining military support for Kyiv and economic pressure on Moscow, and creating a “coalition of the willing” to guarantee Ukrainian security. Mr Vancederided“20,000 troops from some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years”, then claimed that he was not referring to Britain or France.European leaders must continue trying to buy time, deferring further US perfidy, and hasten rearmament for themselves and Ukraine. On Tuesday, Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, announceda proposal, including changes to EU fiscal rules, which she said could mobilise nearly €800bn for defence spending. A rival operator to Starlink isin talkswith European leaders about satellite services.But this is an administration which moves abruptly and erratically.Ukraineand Europe are racing against the clock, not knowing when zero hour will arrive. It is likely to be sooner rather than later.Explore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpUS politicsVladimir PutinRussiaEuropeeditorialsShareReuse this content"

It was bad advice – and Zelenskyy should ignore it. In any case he doesn’t have much choice.The US president and his team have since made it clear that they want his scalp as part of their plan to rush through a ceasefire deal with Moscow that would leave Ukraine partitioned, without US or Nato security guarantees, but with US companies pouring in to exploit its strategic minerals. In the mafia style that he wields so convincingly, Trump unleashed his attack dogs to call for Zelenskyy’s removal,and declared“this guy doesn’t want there to be Peace as long as he has America’s backing”. Then he pulled the plug on US military assistance to Kyiv in an attempt to force Ukraine to its knees and impose Vladimir Putin’s terms for an end to the fighting.It is now abundantly clear that theTrump administrationisn’t interested in mending fences with Zelenskyy, so he would merely court more humiliation without gaining extra arms supplies or security guarantees if he went crawling to his tormentors now. The man who refused to surrender to Putin’s invasion should not yield now to Trump’s ultimatums and extortion.He would do better to pressure his European supporters to deliver fast on their promises, while dangling the same reward of access to Ukrainian rare earths if they do so. This could become part of a package for an accelerated EU accession process for Kyiv.If Trump goes further, as he may well do, and cuts off the US intelligence feed to Ukraine and access to Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite communications, European countries must step in fast to help Kyiv using theEU’s government satellite networkto avoid being totally blinded. The US should beware of taking such steps, which would signal to allies around the world that neither its security partnership nor its tech companies can be relied on for dependable service in a crisis.The White House train wreck happened so fast that someEuropean leadersare still struggling to catch up with the significance of the event. That’s understandable, since it upended their mental universe, in which the transatlantic bond was always the bedrock of European security, enabling them to live in prosperity for decades without spending too much on defence because they were under a protective US shield.Within hours of the Oval Office bust-up, Rutte said it was “important that President Zelenskyy finds a way to restore his relationship with the American president and with the senior American leadership team”. You can’t blame him for trying to hold together the alliance that pays his wages and that has kept the peace in Europe for 75 years. But Rutte is in denial about the new reality in Washington. It will take time to adjust, but we don’t have that time.Likewise,Starmer’s call for bridge-buildingand mending relationships with the US, even as he declared Britain’sfull support for Ukraine, was an exercise in mental gymnastics at a time when the Trump administration has decided to throw Kyiv under the bus in the quest for a new bonanza in relations with Russia. The UK’s security is so intertwined with the US, including the closest of intelligence-sharing relationships and reliance on US components and targeting software for its nuclear deterrent, that no British leader ever wants to face the nightmare choice between loyalty to Ukraine’s just cause and the so-called special relationship with Washington.It’s now up to the Europeans, including the UK, to show they are willing to go on supporting Ukraine practically, by emptying their ammunition stocks to keep Kyiv supplied and ramping up industrial production to deliver a steady flow of shells. They must remove remainingself-imposed restrictionson allowing Ukraine to use medium-range missiles to strike Russian bases and supply lines. And they must draw up practical plans for a security force to support Ukraine after a ceasefire with the assumption of little or no US support, despite Starmer’s plea for a US backstop.Zelenskyy cuts both a heroic and a tragic figure. He embodied Ukrainian resistance to tyranny whenRussiastruck, he has been a brave war leader under fire, yet now he increasingly looks like a martyr, to be torn asunder between a vengeful Putin and an unscrupulous Trump.But Zelenskyy andUkrainecan still emerge from this war as the successful defenders of their own and Europe’s freedom, provided European countries now back him to the hilt. Even if they cannot recover every inch of stolen territory, Ukrainians should fight on under Zelenskyy’s leadership and with European support for a fairer peace.Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now he’s waging war on weather forecastersArwa MahdawiHow do you stop people worrying about the climate emergency? By sacking anyone whose job it is to keep an eye on it. Chalk up another win for Project 2025Tue 4 Mar 2025 09.54 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 12.20 ESTShareSome politicians go whichever way the wind blows. Not, however, the US’s esteemed leader, Donald Trump. He is such a force of nature that he can dictate the direction of the wind. During his first term, hesuggested “nuking hurricanes”to stop them from hitting the country. A few weeks after that, Trump seemed to think he could alter the course of Hurricane Dorian with a black marker,scribbling over an official mapto change its anticipated trajectory in an incidentnow known as Sharpiegate. Weirdly, Dorian did not end up following Trump’s orders. Hurricanes can be uncooperative like that.Six weeks into Trump’s second term, the president hasn’t bombed any hurricanes, but he has nuked the US’s weather-forecasting capabilities. Last week, hundreds of workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US’s pre-eminent climate research agency,were abruptly fired.Experts and lawmakers have warned that the ramifications could be wide-ranging and deadly. “Ships will not be able to safely navigate through our waterways. Farmers will not have the data they need to manage their crops,” Maria Cantwell, a Democratic senator from Washington,said in a statement. “This action is a direct hit to our economy, because Noaa’s specialised workforce provides products and services that support more than a third of the nation’s GDP.”Doesn’t sound ideal, does it? I know this is a bit like asking why water is wet, but why is the Trump-Musk administration being so reckless? Why are they waging war on the weather?Partly because someone stands to get rich from of all this, one imagines. The Noaa cuts may be shocking, but they weren’t surprising. Republicans have long been pushing to limit the government’s role in weather forecasting in order to privatise large sections of it. This plan was clearlylaid out in Project 2025, a blueprint for the Trump administration, which recommended that the National Weather Service, run by Noaa, should “fully commercialize its forecasting operations” and focus on providing data to private companies.There is always money to be made from dismantling government services. Elon Musk’s businesses havereceived at least $38bn(£30bn) in government contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits, according to a Washington Post analysis. It certainly wouldn’t be shocking if Musk’s vast Starlink satellite network – which Dutch meteorologists once warned was interfering withsatellite measurementsthat are indispensable for accurate weather forecasts – suddenly got somelucrative weather-related government contracts.Privatisation of a public good isn’t all bad news, though: we can probably expect exciting innovation. Subscription-based disaster services, perhaps. For just $9.99 a month, you can access exclusive information about whether a hurricane or wildfire is heading to your neighbourhood! Opt for the $999 a month plan and getprivate firefighters dispatched to your doorwhile the poor watch their homes burn!Of course, Trump’s war on the weather isn’t just about money; it’s also about science denialism. Project 2025 claims that Noaa should be dismantled because it is “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry”. If we get rid of data about the climate crisis, then it’s bound to go away, isn’t it? Remember whenTrump advocated a similar approachto Covid? He said: “If we stop testing right now, we’d have very few cases, if any.” Hard to argue with toddler logic.Ultimately, however, the attacks on Noaa show that even the weather has been swept up in the culture wars. It used to be a safe topic, something you could chat about with strangers. Now, simply providing context to weather reports can get people very heated indeed. For example, during the summer 2022 heatwave in the UK, when temperatures reached record highs of 40.3C, weather forecasters such as Laura Tobin found themselves getting harassed for linking theheatwave to the climate crisis.This abuse is part of a trend. Meteorologists around the world havebeen subjected to increasing harassment. This is partly, I suspect, because, deep down, even the science deniers are fearful. There is an apt tweet about the climate crisisthat pops up a lot: “Climate change will manifest as a series of disasters viewed through phones with footage that gets closer and closer to where you live until you’re the one filming it.” What used to seem abstract and remote is now steadily encroaching on all our lives – even those of people living in placesonce considered climate havens. Trump can declare war on the weather all he likes, but it’s become alarmingly clear that this is a war that no one will win.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But combined with infrastructure investment, protectionism can be a progressive boonTue 4 Mar 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 12.37 ESTShareIn the run-up to the 2024 election, a lot of people were ringing alarms about Donald Trump’s tariffs. Kamala HarriscalledTrump’s policies a “tax on the American people” and warned of sky-high prices. According to the Nobel prize-winning economistJoseph Stiglitz, they are “very bad for America and for the world”. His fellow Nobel laureatePaul Krugmancalled them “small, ugly, and stupid”. More recently, the whirlwind tariff drama of the past two months – first a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada, then a 30-day “pause” on that policy, aplanto raise tariffs on steel, aluminum and agricultural goods, plus an across the board tariff hike on China – has generated yet more frenzied debate about the danger of tariffs.Observers aren’t wrong to criticize the US president’s policies. His proposed tariffs seem unlikely to improve what ails the US economy. Worse, applying tariffs as broadly as he’s proposed, and without any supplementary industrial strategy, does risk needlessly raising prices while acting like a big corporate giveaway. Yet, despite what elite economists say, tariffs can be sound, and progressive, economic policy.In fact, liberals might be surprised to learn that during his administration Joe Biden actually raised the highest tariffs in recent American history: a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles. Why? Because tariffs work.Despite what elite economists say, tariffs can be sound, and progressive, economic policyTariffs are, simply put, taxes on certain imported goods, paid by the importer. The goal is to make foreign products more expensive than their Made-In-USA counterparts. This is why people refer to tariffs as “walls” that help “protect” domestic industry from global competition. Right now,Chinaquickly and efficiently produces fleets of electric vehicles that are – thanks to the low cost of Chinese labor – a lot cheaper than the EVs made in the United States. Without tariffs, it would be impossible for US-made models to compete. Since making electric cars was a big goal for Biden, his administration raised an eye-watering tariff that would double the price of any Chinese-made import.The EV example is useful because it demonstrates the difference between Biden’s tariff policies and Trump’s.Trump has, for the most part, not focused on raising tariffs on particular imported goods but instead on all goods coming from certain countries. Mexico andCanadaface across-the-board tariffs; China was already facing 10% tariffs, doubling to 20%. But raising the prices of all products from these countries doesn’t help develop any particular line of US manufacturing. Tariffs like these are both too broad and too small to make a positive impact. A 20% tariff on all Chinese goods might make it more expensive for Americans to continue to buy certain things from China. But nothing in that policy encourages Americans to buy American-made products; they might just as well find a Vietnamese supplier to avoid the tariff while continuing to reap the benefits of cheap labor. Moreover, it’s possible that some Chinese manufacturers will simply eat the additional costs and sell their goods at slightly slimmer profit margins. Or, equally likely, they will try to avoid the tariffs by having other companies assemble their products in neighboring countries before sending them to the US. As is, Trump’s country-based tariffs seem more like a geopolitical tool than an economic one. Frankly, they don’t make much sense if the goal is to bring factories home.Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs are closer to the mark. By making all steel imports (regardless of national origin) subject to thesametariff, the policy could succeed in making US steel comparatively cheaper for domestic buyers.View image in fullscreen‘Raising the prices of all products from these countries doesn’t help develop any particular line of American manufacturing.’Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesYet even this wouldn’t make US steel bigger or better, or make its production more efficient. Nor would it necessarily raise the wages of steel workers. Pure and simple protectionism will benefit existing US steel manufacturers, but no one much beyond that. Without the government stepping in to develop new manufacturing – encouraging the adoption of the latest techniques to make a superior product, actively building new demand for American steel, or providing social guarantees for steel workers – tariffs alone risk protecting a sick industry without much upside.So what would a labor-forward tariff program look like? It would combine tariffs with big investments in infrastructure to help steer industry, and the country, into better economic health.For steel, such a fix isn’t hard to imagine. The US benefits from being a continental-sized country, with hundreds of thousands of bridges, school buildings, libraries, miles of rail and highway. All of those things are made with steel. And all of them are falling apart. Major new investments in infrastructure upgrades would provide the tariff-protected steel industry the new demand needed to grow, and provide the requisite scale for industrial dynamism.Trump thinks antagonising China will help save the US economy. He couldn’t be more wrong | Melanie BrusselerRead moreIn exchange, steel firms should be required to provide family-sustaining wages and benefits, and promise to stay neutral in union elections. Not only this, but the government should have some say in actually directing the production process. New steel plants should be built in places that need jobs, not isolated tax-free industrial parks, but in the very same areas that were obliterated by deindustrialization. That is, production should be directed, first and foremost, toward public use and social ends.Some might wonder: why bother with such an expensive experiment?Manufacturing is still a huge part of the US economy and it is among the only sectors that consistently provides high wages for a large base of workers. Protecting that industrial foundation is essential not only for those workers, but for the health of other sectors too. When a factory closes, it’s not just the high-wage blue-collar workers who are thrown out of jobs. So are all the middle-income truck drivers who deliver the goods. And all the high-skilled mechanics who fix the machines. Not to mention the servers and cooks who staff now empty local restaurants. The only businesses that grow in the wake of a factory closing are those related to opioids and alcohol.Since Nafta was signed,tens of thousandsof factories have closed in the US. Millions of largely union jobs have been lost. This fact alone explains so much of the populist revolt against globalization. And while it’s unlikely that we could ever return to the industrial output of 1946, is it that hard to imagine returning to 1994? If Pearl Jam is still making albums, can’t the US still make steel?Rebuilding our manufacturing capacity will be a big part of building a better country. And tariffs – deployed wisely with big investments – are an indispensable tool for doing so.Dustin Guastella is a research associate at the Center for Working Class Politics and the director of operations for Teamsters Local 623Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpChinaMexicoCanadacommentShareReuse this content"

But is pointing that out an effective attack?Jan-Werner MüllerCharges of hypocrisy do not land if the supposed hypocrite is not committed to any kind of consistency in the first placeTue 4 Mar 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 08.21 ESTShareHistorians and psychologists will study when exactly the meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy started to descend into political disaster. A plausible contender for an answer is the – in itself trivial – moment when Brian Glenn, representative of the far-right outletReal America’s Voice (newly admitted to the press pool)asked the Ukrainian president why he was not wearing a suit.That framing – the wartime president was somehow “disrespecting” America – was then picked up in the vile attack on Zelenskyy by JD Vance and repeated by a chorus of sycophants in the Republican party (including Glenn’s girlfriend Marjorie Taylor Greene). Critics immediately pointed out the hypocrisy: ifElon Muskcan appear in a T-shirt and a baseball cap at a cabinet meeting, what is wrong with someone wearing fatigues? That gotcha might provide momentary psychological satisfaction – but it’s important to understand why the charges of hypocrisy achieve little with the Maga-world and why, as a matter of political psychology, something different is needed.Trump’s style of petty domination was in full display with Zelenskyy | Moira DoneganRead moreAccording to amuch-repeated maximfrom a 17th-century French moralist, hypocrisy is the homage vice pays to virtue. According to this logic, hypocrisy actually contributes to moral standards being upheld, as no one wants to be seen flaunting them openly. Wearing a suit is obviously not an important “norm” – part ofthe problem with the whole debateabout aspiring authoritarians breaking norms and crashing through guardrails has been that those diagnosing violations of norms have not always distinguished between different kinds of norms. They have also not made it clear why some norms matter for democracy much more than others (Trump was criticized for breakingthe “norm” of having a petin the White House).The larger issue, though, is that charges of hypocrisy do not land if the supposed hypocrite is not committed to any kind of consistency in the first place. They can simply assert that that the inconsistency happens to be justified: Musk de facto presiding over the cabinet meeting is OK because, hey, he’s a genius who can see more clearly than the rest of us why stopping cancer research and making hurricanes more deadly are actually making America greater in the long run. Zelenskyy, by contrast, is a Democrat in disguise who just does “propaganda”,according to Vance.An even better option for seeming hypocrites is to assert their superiority over those making the charge: Viktor Orbán is frequentlyaccused of having betrayedhis original liberal convictions; after all, he had been financed by George Soros to spend time at Oxford, his political party had a liberal, even outright anti-clerical, and pro-European program – before Orbán transformed himself into a cheerleader for the international far right. The response easily available to the authoritarian prime minister is that he has actually learnt something over the course of his career – to wit, that liberalism doesn’t work in his country – whereas the liberal critics, contrary to their self-image as sophisticated thinkers, cling to dogmas. Vance has kept pulling the same trick: he haslearnt to stop worrying about Trump being Hitlerand simply come to love the good felon, always emphasizing that he was able to see something in Trump that lesser mortals fail to get.A final reason why the accusation of hypocrisy is hardly a knock-down argument – and the one most applicable to Maga – is that those always ready to lie can hardly be caught out by claims about inconsistency. It is now clear that the Trump campaign was based on deceptions – starting with strident denials of any association with the Project 2025Christian nationalists-cum-authoritarians. By the same token, Trump’s nominees were not exactlytruthfulin their confirmation hearings; and the entire Republican party is now evidently lying about their intended spending cuts.Trump said Zelenskyy ‘does not have the cards’. But how well is he playing his own hand? | Olga ChyzhRead morePointing out the inconsistencies between what Maga Republicans – it’s not clear at this point whether there are any others – say one day and do the next will not be seen as a cause for moral introspection; rather, the inconsistency is proof of Maga’s power. What observers callperformative lyingis part of authoritarianism – think of Vladimir Putin lying to his interlocutor’s’ face, smiling, knowing that they know that he is lying, but cannot do anything about it.What about broader audiences? Do they not care about hypocrisy? True, some might; but, given theself-enclosed rightwing media ecospherewhich has been created in the United States over decades – and the attention deficit of the public more broadly, to put it bluntly – it is unlikely that finer points about inconsistencies will get much of a hearing.The challenge is to devise rhetoric – and powerful gestures – that do not rely on complicated comparisons but stress how Trump and Musk are sabotaging the country. Democrats might simply boycott the Trump address to Congress next week and instead hold rallies and town halls establishing meaningful connections with citizens who Republicans are nowrefusingto listen to – and, yes, on those occasions, also slip in a point about hypocrisy: that the party that blathers about “giving power to the people” is afraid of any contact with the people.Jan-Werner Müller is a professor of politics at Princeton University and is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineRepublicansElon MuskEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

But it still has a role to playTue 4 Mar 2025 04.51 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 08.44 ESTShareAfew days before theMunich Security Conference, one of the Ukrainian military officers fighting on the eastern Ukrainian border told me about intercepts of the Russian army talks their unit had obtained. Russian middle-level commanders were instructing their subordinates to hold on for a bit as “with Donald Trump in the office”, their “goals would finally be met, and the fight would be over soon”. The Ukrainians pointed out that it was not a unique intercept, and the idea that the new American president was good for Moscow troops was being widely expressed by the Russians.Recently, I asked Ukrainian frontline soldiers what they thought about the negotiations. Those in action are too busy fighting to follow everyday news from Munich, Riyadh, Washington and Kyiv. Yet they generally feel that “Donald Trump is heading in the wrong direction”. Today,as Trump “pauses” all military aid, they will know those instincts were right.It was never the case that American defence assistance – the real leverage the US has to pressureUkraineto enter the deal with Russia – didn’t matter to them. For the last weeks the Ukrainian media has been full of analysis and comment by the Ukrainian military on whether it is possible to fight without America’s weapons. Soldiers and officers explained which equipment is critical to the effort, and raised concerns that the military leadership should have decreased its dependence on the Elon Musk-owned Starlink satellite service way earlier. But other military remind us that during the first months of the full-scale invasion, they fought with little US support, as the weapons they had initially been given were more suitable for guerrilla warfare than conventional war.There is more hope than expectation, even resignation now when it comes to Trump. Today’s decision, blocking billions in crucial shipments – ammunition and vehicles – has dismayed many but surprises no one.After the grimly historic White House encounterbetween Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and vice-president JD Vance, it was feared that one repercussion would be exactly this sudden withdrawal of US military aid. It was a fear Ukrainians had but were loth to speak of until it happened. Now it has happened. How long a “pause” will there be and what effect: who knows?On the ground level, the Ukrainian military leadership will plan how to substitute the equipment that was supposed to come first. Delivering weapons from the Polish border to the frontline usually takes time.This morning, the Ukrainian air force reported destroying 65 Russian drones in nine Ukrainian regions. The suspension of the US weapons, which include ammunition, vehicles, and shells for air defence, won’t affect today’s battlefield. But it gives the Russians reason to intensify attacks on the energy infrastructure, something they have failed to destroy so far, primarily due to the existence of air defence. Also, after this step by Washington, the military expects the Kremlin to launch more ground attacks to exhaust Ukrainian arsenals.The Ukrainian government will search for ways to resume communication with the White House mainly to give the country more time.There was always a difference in perception about the “deal” offered by Trump, that is at the heart of the deteriorating US-Ukraine relations. The media and political class saw it one way, the people another. The press has been focused on things such as the proposedmineral rights agreement, and the meeting between the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. But Ukrainians didn’t consider either of those as being likely to end the war. Rather, both were sent as signs of the Trump administration resetting its relationships with Ukraine and separately with Russia – introducing new demands of payment for support in the former case, and indicating a willingness to restart relations in the latter.After Friday’s angry encounter, it became clear that the While House believed Zelenskyy should be ready to accept any agreement, as Trump’s word should be seen as a sufficient guarantee. The US president insisted that Vladimir Putin wouldn’t make further attacks because he respects Trump. Challenging the idea that Trump’s word is not enough is already seen by Washington as disrespectful and offensive. Of course Ukrainians fear any settlement that does not provide explicit security guarantees and allows the Kremlin to use the pause to prepare itself for a renewed and intensified offensive.Ukrainians noted but were not shaken by Trump and Vance’s tone. For decades, we have had to communicate with Russians, who have lied, threatened and mocked human suffering. Even some European neighbours, the Hungarian and Slovakian leaders, act this way. During this latest meeting, it became evident that US leaders do not see Putin – the man whose army committed war crimes – as their enemy. All can see now that in Trump’s world, as in Putin’s world, a few big states have rights and can dominate small states.The problem is not Zelenskyy not having “good cards”, as the US leader said. It’s an American president using his cards to help Putin. Since the American president does not want to have confrontational relations with the Kremlin, his only solution for the end of the war is to force Ukraine to agree to the Russian terms and for Trump, it looks like the fastest option.What to do next? Until now, Kyiv’s ultimate goal was to garner global support to end the war with an agreement that would bring strong security guarantees. Ukrainians were and are ready to compromise, but security guarantees matter the most. Their modalities may be discussed: providing weapons to the extent that the army would be capable of defending itself at any given moment, investing in Ukraine’s defence industry, providing comprehensive air defence, sending foreign peacekeepers and integrating Ukraine further into western security architecture.Trump has utterly changed the rules of engagement. World leaders must learn this – and quickly  | Simon TisdallRead moreIf those cards are not on the table, any freeze benefits Moscow.Still, the only reasonable option for Ukraine is to continue fighting, relying on itself plus the backing of Europe and other global partners whose support is genuine and values-based. There will be a high price to pay. And the burden will be on the shoulders of Ukrainian soldiers, who are still fighting actual battles while Ukrainian and European leaders are caught in a geopolitical storm.So far, Ukrainians truly believe that security guarantees provided by the US and Europe together will be treated seriously by the Kremlin, which considers Europe alone weak. Right after Vance’s Munich speech attacking Europe, Zelenskyy called European leaders to help him talk to the Americans (which they did). Ukraine understands well how precious transatlantic unity is.Zelenskyy will search for a way not to alienate the White House further, and “apologise” (even without understanding for what).But after the White House meeting, and even more today, a new question arises: if the goal is to have the US be part of the solution to the Russian invasion and a guarantor of peace, is it reasonable for Ukraine to trust and count on the new US administration? What if something it signs today is dismissed tomorrow? Would the promises be delivered? Could Republicans as a whole – despite supporting Ukraine in its right to defend itself in thisjust war, and despite promoting policies to deter Russian threats for decades – change their tune according to the mood in the White House? We can’t know the answers. We can only press on each day.Nataliya Gumenyuk is a Ukrainian journalist and CEO of the Public Interest Journalism LabDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In which case is Donald Trump another Neville Chamberlain and Ukraine another Czechoslovakia? Is history bunk, or is it a wise old man leaning on the gate as Europe storms into its latest crisis?Godwin’s lawholds that the longer a political argument continues, the nearer it gets to Hitler. Thisreductio adHitlerumdistorts the issue under discussion and diminishes the exceptional horror of Hitler and the Holocaust. A variant of Godwin’s law goes further. It asserts that having to call Hitler in aid means that you have already lost the argument.Putin’s actions in Ukraine have been horrific enough to need no exaggeration. Trump’s sympathy towards him has been eccentric enough. Yet hardly a commentary on Ukraine fails to hint at “another world war” or Hitler or 1930s appeasement. Acartoon by Michael de Adderdepicts Chamberlain declaring “peace in our time” (he actually said “peace for our time”) with the Munich agreement and Trump in talks with Putin. The Führer is always on hand when needed.No post-revolution Russian rulers have sought to invade western Europe. What they have done is suppress and dominate the “buffer zone” of their immediate neighbours, such as Poland, Finland, Ukraine and Armenia. A better parallel for Putin is the west’s old ally, Stalin. He conned Franklin D Roosevelt at Yalta into believing that after the war he wanted merely to ensure he hadfriendly democracies along Russia’s border. FDR boasted that Stalin favoured him over the sceptical Winston Churchill,adding: “If I give him everything I possibly can and ask nothing from him in return … he won’t try to annex anything and will work with me for a world of democracy and peace.” If parallels you want, Putin is Stalin and Trump is FDR.The answer is that we choose the villains who most suit our case. There is no evidence that the Soviet Union had imperial designs on western Europe, nor have I heard of Putin harbouring such an ambition. Yet this assumption has underpinned the Nato alliance since the end of the second world war. A proclaimed fear of Russian aggression fuelled the US build-up of military might that has been one of the greatest in history. After 1989, intensive research failed to validate this fear, not least the work on Russian archives of Andrew Alexander inAmerica: the Imperialism of Ignorance.Yet deterrence and its handmaid, fear, depend on worst-case scenarios. If we say there is no Hitler lurking in the Kremlin, the defence lobby asks how we can be sure. Has the military-industrial complex not kept Europe free of another Hitler for 80 years? Billions have been spent – who cares if wasted? – but it has worked. Defence now demands Britain raise its military spend from 2.3% of GDPto 2.5%. It will apparently make the difference between Putin’s tanks charging across western Europe and leaving him quaking in his boots. Don’t impede the lobby now at its moment of maximum trial.History can of course offer an opposing thesis. This is that Putin is merely another custodian of Russia’s paranoid patriotism. As he struggles to rescue his country from cold war defeat, he is threatened by an institutionally belligerent west. Think of Charles XII of Sweden or Napoleon or Hitler’s tanks just a few dozen miles from Moscow. How did Nato expect Moscow to react as western armies advanced across Russia’s old buffer zone at the turn of the 21st century, with one former ally joining after another?A century ago Teddy Roosevelt likewise guarded America’s back yard in the Pacific. Trump is doing the same now against Panama and Canada. The west did not stop Russia guarding its “sphere of interest” when it invaded Georgia, or Crimea and easternUkrainein 2014. Putin was always likely to feel threatened by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, particularly when he perceived Ukraine to be stuffed with anti-Russian fascists.Putin’s one massive misjudgment – as he must now recognise – was the assault on Kyiv in 2022. He gambled thatNatowould not aid a free state to which it was not formally allied. He was wrong. Whatever ceasefire deal is eventually reached, Putin is unlikely to make the same mistake again.On this thesis, since even Nato’s worst-case scenario substantially diminished with the fall of the Soviet Union, it was only a matter of time before Washington called Europe’s bluff. Americans could not see why they should spend vast sums defendingEuropefrom an implausible threat, which Europe was not prepared to spend itself. If Europe really thinks Putin is Hitler, it should pay up. It is Europe’s Hitler not America’s.The true third way is to concentrate on Putin as Putin and Trump as Trump. Both should be assessed on their own terms and on those of their times. These times are the 2020s not the 1940s or even the 1980s. Britain certainly faces threats and hostilities, the greatest being commercial and technological, which is where defence spending should surely be directed. Yet Britain’s military leaders have spent the past monthdemanding a “national arsenal” of futuristic weapons, as if Hitler were still at our door. They are still hooked on Dad’s Army.Keir Starmer told the Commons last week that Britain was under a greater threat of attack than ever since the cold war. He offered no explanation. The politics of fear always has the best tunes and defence is never precise in its greed. What is precise is Starmer’s readiness to sacrifice Britain’s public services and its overseas aid to the cause. That cannot be right.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Australian Bureau of Meteorologyhas warnedit may bring severe hazards and “dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding”.So, how do you prepare for a cyclone – and what do you do if it’s too late to leave?How to prepare for a cycloneYour starting point is to consider the risk to yourself and everyone in your household (including pets). Consider ensuring you have:non-perishable food that everyone in the family will eat (enough for five to seven days)water for drinking and cleaning (three litres per person per day)medication (two weeks worth)toiletries and first aid kitpet food/suppliestorchesbatteriesa back-up battery for your phonebaby formula and nappies if neededprotective clothing and closed-in shoescash in small denominationsvaluable documents such as passports, title deeds, ID, insurance details, photos (these can be photographed or packed in weather-proof container or envelope)kids’ books, card games, board games, headphonesanything else you may need or really value (and isn’t too heavy to carry).Make sure you have a grab-and-go kit that you can carry by yourself if authorities suddenly tell you to evacuate immediately.Tropical Cyclone Alfred: 20,000 Brisbane homes could be floodedRead moreConventional wisdom used to be to prepare enough supplies for three days of disruption. Now, experts recommend having enough for five to seven days. After the initial disaster there may be road blockages or supply chain problems.Ensure you have enough medication for a week or two, because pharmacies may take days or weeks to reopen. And remember that many medications, such as insulin, need to be refrigerated, so consider how you’d keep them cool if the power went out.Fill containers with water and stick them in your freezer now; they can keep your freezer cool if you lose power. They can also become drinking water in future.Talk to your neighbours. Do they have a generator or a camping fridge you can use? This is a great opportunity to get to know your community and pool your resources.Ask yourself if you have friends with whom you or a pet can stay. One of the main reasons people don’t evacuate is because they can’t bring their pets (not all evacuation shelters allow them, so check in advance).Consider what you can do now to prepare your house. One of the most common call-outs the SES receives is about blocked drains and gutters, so check if there’s time to clean your gutters now. You won’t be able to do it during the storm.Stay informed – and don’t rely on hearsayHave a plan for getting truthful information before, during and after the cyclone.Rely on the information provided by official sources, as they will tell you when it’s too late to evacuate or when it’s safe to come out. This is highly context-specific and will depend on where you are located.Get advice where possible from your local council’sdisaster dashboard(most councils have one).It should provide information such as where to get sandbags, which roads are closed (which can affect your evacuation plan) and evacuation centre openings and locations.Anyone who monitors social media will see how many amateur meteorologists and maps are out there, but these are often not the best source. Always rely on official sources rather than hearsay, trending footage or amateur “experts”.Always have an battery-operated AM-FM radio. If power goes out, relying on your phone to track information will drain your phone battery very quickly.Alice thought Brisbane wouldn’t flood twice in one decade. Now she’s bracing for Tropical Cyclone Alfred to hitRead moreYou may be able to charge it via your car or laptop, but telecommunications networks may not be active.So having a battery-operated radio on hand – and plenty of batteries – is crucial.What if the cyclone hits while you’re at home?If it’s too late to evacuate, have a plan for sheltering in place.Find the smallest room in your house with the least windows (which can shatter in a storm). This is often the bathroom, but it could be under the stairs. It is usually on the lowest level of the house.Bring your food, water, radio, blankets and supplies there. Avoid walking around the house during the cyclone to fetch things; there could be glass on the floor or debris flying around.It’s hard to predict how long you will need to shelter there but it’s important not to leave until official sources say it is safe to do so.Cyclones come in stages. They arrive from one direction, then comes an eerie calm as the “eye of the storm” passes over. Next, the other half of the cyclone arrives. Don’t go outside during the eye of the storm, because it’s not over.Outside the house, there may be power lines down, broken glass and other hazards. Don’t venture out until you get official clearance from the disaster dashboard or official sources on the radio saying it is safe.Fornon-life threatening emergencies– such as a tree on your roof, or water running through your house – call the SES on 132 500 or register on theSES Assistance app(if you’re in Queensland). They will not come during the event itself but will come later.If it’s a life-threatening emergency, always call triple 0.After the stormAfter the storm, consider how to make your house more cyclone-ready in future. Many houses in northQueenslandare designed for cyclone zones, but not as many further south will be.Climate change means cyclones are likely to be more severe in future. These days, be cyclone-ready 365 days a year.Yetta Gurtner is adjunct senior lecturer at the Centre for Disaster Studies at James Cook University.

But does any of it actually help?What do we know about the gut microbiome?Dr Saman Khalesi, head of course for nutrition at the Central Queensland University, says there are no quick fixes to a healthy gut, but what online content often misses is the important role fibre plays in contributing to the growth of healthy gut bacteria.Of the trillions of microorganisms that live in our gastrointestinal tract (more commonly known as our gut), some of these bacteria are helpful and some are not. A balanced gut flora contains more of those beneficial bacteria and yeasts compared with the harmful ones.In order for the good bacteria in the gut to survive, they need to be fed mostly on the dietaryfibres which come from complex carbohydrates from foods such as cereals, wholemeal grains, fruits and vegetables, Khalesi says. Refined carbohydrates – such as those in ultra-processed foods – tend to be absorbed quickly and don’t reach the colon for the microorganisms to feast on.Dietary fibres that feed good bacteria of the gut are also commercially known as prebiotics, while probiotics refer to the live bacteria that are beneficial for us. Fermented foods such as kimchi and yoghurt can directly provide extra live bacterias to the gut, but their benefit is dependent on having the dietary fibres which create the environment for those bacteria to produce benefits.While supplements for both exist, Khalesi says it is better to get them naturally through a healthy varied diet, except in cases where people take antibiotics after an infection, have chronic disease affecting their gut balance (such as inflammatory bowel disease and constipation) or have poor general dietary intake.In healthy people who maintain a balanced diet and lifestyle, there is little evidence for probiotic supplements.So how do these online trends stack up?Prof Rajaraman Eri from RMIT University says viral trends such as the internal shower drink could be beneficial because chia seeds contain fibre. The dietary fibre of most Australians is “extremely lacking – we don’t even consume half of what is required”.However, Eri also says it is important people have a combination of fibres from different food sources, which will help improve gut health over a period of time. “It is not going to improve overnight.”The microbiome is extremely individual and while for some people improving their diet can improve their gut microbiome in two weeks, for some people it will take a year, he says.Multivitamins promise glowing skin, better sleep and a longer life. But who do supplements really benefit? | Donna LuRead moreWhen it comes to the candida diet, which aims to decrease the common candida bacteria by eliminating added sugar as well as high-sugar fruits, gluten, alcohol and some dairy products, Eri says for healthy people there is no need to be worried about candida because it is part of the microbiota, which can be controlled by the healthy bacteria when the gut is in balance.However, Eri says eliminating added sugars and ultra-processed foods (which the candida diet recommends) is part of good nutrition. Following that generalised advice promotes good gut health, as bad bacteria in the gut feed on sugar while ultra-processed foods often deprive the gut of fibre.I think I have a gut condition – what should I do?Dr Emma Halmos, a practising dietitian and senior research fellow at Monash University, says many gut symptoms are normal and simply our body’s way of giving us cues, for example to stop eating if we’ve overindulged. However, when people experience symptoms that prevent them from leaving the house (unless they’ve put their body under pressure by, say, eating a 10-course meal or running a marathon), Halmos says people should visit a doctor.It is very important people don’t self-diagnose because these nonspecific symptoms – such as bloating, abdominal pain or changes in bowel motions – could be caused by a variety of conditions, she says. It could be a new classification known as DGBI, which stands for disorders of gut brain interaction,the most common being irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or organic diseases that cause inflammation such as coeliac, or even gynaecological issues.For specific conditions there are often very effective dietary therapies – for example, alow-Fodmap diet for those with IBS, Halmos says.The take-home messageNo matter what advice is being promoted on social media, Halmos says, the bottom line is “your background diet matters”.A lot of the messages around gut health online are fuelled by the weight-loss industry, particularly “anti-inflammatory and inflammatory”, which she describes as “buzzwords … often used incorrectly”.Most of us don’t have inflammation of the gut – active inflammation includes coeliac disease, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, Halmos says.So if you’re after good gut health, before reaching for a supplement or trying a fad, think about consulting a health professional or including more fibre in your diet first.The good news is it doesn’t just have to be all beans and bran flakes – dietary fibreexists in nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables and wholegrains, and the more diverse your diet, the better for your gut.Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claims.Ask AntiviralWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

And not in a good wayMarina HydeA whole political and cultural era is passing, and who better than the Duchess of Sussex as a symbol of all we have left behindTue 4 Mar 2025 07.22 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 08.10 ESTShareAre peonies a life philosophy? Are “life philosophies” even philosophy? I have to hold on to the idea that they aren’t, even in the face of a decade or so of Instagram blitzkrieg, most currently in the form of Duchess Meghan’s eight-part new TV show, which dropped onNetflixfirst thing this morning. With Love, Meghan seems to have migrated fully formed from Mark Zuckerberg’s social media platform on to Ted Sarandos’s streaming service, powered by the hashtags that bypass the need for joined-up sentences, let alone thinking. Or as Her Grace explains: “Everyone’s invited to create wonder in every moment.” This is an offer not even promised by most major religions.The mildest way to describe this show is as a ghastly artefact of a particular cultural era that recently met its apocalypse. But more on that later. To anyone who says, “It’s just meant to be fun”: bullshit. Netflix reportedly paid $100m (£78m) to Prince Harry and the manic pixie dream duchess for an overall deal, so for the streamer it’s meant to make back at least a small amount of the big amount of money they’ve lost, when audiences failed to connect with the Sussex-authored documentaries about global justice activists and polo. For Meghan, it’s supposed to assist her transformation into domestic guru. If you don’t mind arching an eyebrow at the lifestyle lunacies offellow Montecito resident Gwyneth Paltrow, then at least have some consistency and give yourself a pass on this one. This show is sensationally absurd and trite, and if you watch it, you know it.Language is either category-five twee or has been reduced to non-sentient babyspeak. “Good vibes, good hives”. “Clean clean clean clean.” “Single skillet spaghetti. S-s-s. S-s-s …” I won’t labour the 1% of the 1% mood, though someone driving through one of America’s most rarefied billionaires’ communities to buy a few hundred dollars’ worth of flowers while telling you, “It’s the little things that count” is obviously ridiculous. As is referring to a bucket as a “garbage vessel”. Nor will I, “as a woman”, do more than note that you don’t see successful men spending for ever on all this stuff. Zuckerberg and Sarandos presumably decided a very long time ago that part of the goal is to not even know where your kitchen is.View image in fullscreenA still from With Love, Meghan.Photograph: Jenna Peffley/NetflixOf much more interest is how these Insta-perfect worlds have grabbed people by the throat and siphoned away so much of their valuable time and attention in recent years. Scrolling the platform or watching Meghan’s show (they are almost identical sensory experiences), you note how much of the language is explicitly religious. Time is described as “sacred”, practices are “rituals”, people are continually feeling “blessed”, snacks are “an offering”, the emphasis is on “honouring” this or that. It becomes hard not to see all the flower frogs and rosemary sprigs and garbage vessels as holy kit, arranged in esoteric fashion as if to summon a form of peace. Or rather, #peace. But peace through retail, always – even if the product turns out to be you.It’s amusing to learn from publicists and Meghan herself that the duchess’s artisan this-and-thats will be available in the Netflix brick-and-mortar stores opening this year. Other eras have had their epicureans or hedonists, of course, who lived and sometimes died for the ideal of simplicity or pleasure in an epic kind of way. But today’s gazillion-strong influencer community has zero intellectual underpinning to it, which is why it’s so often the unwitting butt of its own joke. I’m trying to picture Oscar Wilde being told Netflix is going to sell limited edition artisan Oscar Wilde buttonholes in its shop, and him just fainting at the obvious horror of it all.Sorry to press an unmodernised yet perfectly adequate word into action, but of course all this stuff is perfectlynice. It’s nice if the table is laid nicely, it’s lovely if the flowers are lovely, it’s caring of you to make people feel cared for, whatever that really means. (I wonder if the truly selfless tablescape actually exists – Meghan’s entire MO feels desperately “compliments to the hostess”.) As I say, it’s allnice. But it’s neither a long nor an interesting conversation – at best it should serve as a backdrop to one. And yet over the past rise-of-the-influencer decade, it seems to havebecomethe conversation.The great Harry and Meghan debate rages on – but I’m staying out of it | Zoe WilliamsRead moreDecades often seem to be about certain things, before another, defining thing sneaks in under the radar. The 2000s seemed to be about celebrity culture and Islamist fundamentalism, but in retrospect the 2008 financial crash – both its causes and the failure to deliver justice in its aftermath – was the key event. The 10 years we have just lived through might have seemed to be about social media and what came to be summarised as woke culture. But a global fracturing was stealing under the radar.It certainly isn’t any more. In fact, watching With Love, Meghan early this morning already felt like a past washing over me, so much so that I decided that maybe – and please stay with me for this hot take – maybe, Meghan has made a landmark TV series after all. Immerse yourself in it for an episode or eight, and you instinctively feel that both the show and the duchess embody the age that has become suddenly bygone. And that is the exact feeling that countless people have been experiencing since this year turned – that an era is dying. Or rather, that it has already died, and suddenly. There were many others, but Meghan was as good an avatar for it as any – torn between wildly ineffective social justice activism, and the narcotising retreat of the peonied table. But this is now over, and I think we can all feel it in our bones. Rest in peace/power/whatever. But godspeed to something else – something better – being born.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The problem is getting citizens to accept itSarah BoseleyA focus on digitalisation, community care and health prevention could be revolutionary. But people’s fears have not yet been allayedTue 4 Mar 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 11.47 ESTShareIt’s a national treasure, beloved of the population, still brilliant in so many parts but also run down and crumbling at the edges, huge, expensive and heavily criticised. Who fancies running NHS England? After the panning the outgoing chief executive, Amanda Pritchard,got from MPs earlier this year(which may have precipitated hershock departure), her successor will need guts, determination and a very thick skin.Crucially, they will have to support the NHS revolution that the health secretary, Wes Streeting, has declared. They will have to be a breaker of windows, not a polisher of glass. Streeting – and the public – want change to a service that has now recorded the lowest level of public confidencesince surveys began in 1983. Just under a quarter of adults in last year’s British social attitudes survey said they are satisfied with what they get, even though their love for the NHS is undimmed. Above all, we complain we can’t get to see our GP, accessible on the day often only through a Glastonbury-style telephone queue at 8am, and that waiting times for hospital treatments are shocking. We fear the ambulance that arrives too late, or being left in a corridor because of staff shortages if we get to hospital at all.Streeting has already marked his man, anointing Sir Jim Mackey, the chief executive of Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, as “transition CEO” of NHS England. He’s shown what he can do in slashing waiting times. He’s also national director of elective recovery, charged with reducing the backlog of routine surgery that built up during the Covid pandemic, and he has been chief executive of NHS Improvement. That’s a lot of boxes ticked.But although waiting times are top of the list, it doesn’t end there.The Darzi reportlast year delivered a catastrophic verdict on the state of the NHS after years of austerity and cuts, from the late diagnosis of people with cancer and other serious diseases, particularly in deprived areas, to “crumbling buildings”. Pritchard has been working steadily and clearly wanted to carry on quietly and efficiently doing the job. Under her management, the NHS had set up community diagnostic centres, developed cancer vaccines and successfully popularised its app. “The NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform,” she said inher resignation statement.But the writing may have been on the wall since she was hit with unprecedented criticism by MPs on the health select committee in January, who said they were frustrated by the lack of “drive and dynamism” from Pritchard and two colleagues giving evidence to them. Earlier the same day, a report from the public accounts committee said she and others from NHS England and also the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) werecomplacent and lacked the driveand ideas to transform the service.Streeting wants someone who will make some noise on waiting times for a political win that may give the government space to work on other important areas later. He is a man in a hurry. And he wants more control over NHSEnglandthan ministers have had since Andrew Lansley’s reforms gave it a large degree of independence in 2013. Politicians will always have to take the blame for what goes wrong in the NHS, so they need to decide the direction of travel. That’s probably right, says Siva Anandaciva, director of policy at the King’s Fund: “I think there’s a benefit in having a body specifically dedicated to running the NHS, but politicians saying, ‘This is what I want you to achieve.’”But sometimes the DHSC and NHS England officials are doing the same work, which is unaffordable waste. So streamlining is the aim – and in what some have called a power-grab, thousands ofNHS England jobs are facing the axe.While waiting times have to come down – because it’s important, as well as an issue of credibility for Labour – in the longer term, the success of the health service depends on other things. The government has laid down three priorities for transforming the NHS: the switch fromanalogue to digital, enabling quick access to patient records and data throughout the NHS (somebody once said garage chains nationwide have more info on your car); care in the community; and prevention rather than treatment.These are all no-brainers, and yet the public is doubtful or even resistant in various ways. Patients are not yet convinced that an NHS digital system willkeep their data safe. They don’t want employers, let alone insurance companies, knowing details of their diseases, and they are suspicious of what big pharma might do, reluctant to believe scientists want the info to invent new life-saving drugs. They are anxious that being treated by GPs and nurses in the community might mean they don’t get the best care, which they assume is in hospitals. And they are not sure they want NHS doctors and nurses telling them how to lead a healthier life with lectures on stopping smoking, cutting back the booze and eating vegetables.Yet all of this is absolutely vital to the transformation needed in theNHS. Far too many people are getting unnecessarily sick, while hospital beds are occupied by elderly people, who need to be sent home or into care with community support. Waiting times matter, but the job for Streeting and the new CEO of NHS England is about far more than that.

But he’s attacking the democratic order we yearned forTue 4 Mar 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 04.04 ESTShareEven before theshocking treatmentof Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, the US had voted with Russia in the UN. Alarm bells about the security threat now facing Europe were already ringing duringJD Vance’s speech in Munichin February, when he questioned the point of defending Europe’s liberal democracies from Russia.For the countries surrounding Russia, this is not just about impertinence or failing diplomacy but about potentially being wiped off the map.But they are realising, too, that instead of one “west”, the ideal we so long mythologised even before the collapse of communism, we are – in one of the most important geopolitical shifts in decades – seeing the birth of two.Many people around the world were delighted withVance’s Hillbilly Elegy. His bestselling memoir showed that the desire to rebuild a normal life after a pathological childhood can be a breeding ground for populism.But Vance acts as if a background of hardship and struggle in the American rust belt justifies his disastrous political trajectory. Ultimately, he is completely unconvincing. And not only because, regardless of where he was born, he eventually ended up at Yale law school and is now the US vice-president.The political consequences of trauma should not be underestimated. However, as both individuals and societies, we have choices in how we deal with negative experiences: we can decide to promote polarisation and resentment, or cultivate solidarity and compassion.The entire former eastern bloc was once one big “Hillbilly Elegy”. It took immense effort to lift nations ravaged by communist bankruptcy from political, economic and often moral collapse and turn them into members of the European Union and Nato. To be sure, the successful modernisation after 1989 was not free of political mistakes and suffering.But the division of the continent in 1945 was imposed by the great powers the UK, US and USSR. Our countries were not consulted. The legacy in decades of political and economic stagnation – imposed internationally from above – for us meant poverty, crumbling infrastructure, weak state institutions, and millions struggling with deep uncertainty about their own self-worth. They were often addicted to alcohol, also as a result of Soviet-era social engineering. Being hobbled with this unasked-for legacy did not stop us often being branded laggards or deemed less civilised than our western neighbours as we struggled to catch up.The goal remained clear to us, however: we had to first re-establish our democratic nation states and then set off on a great race to match western standards. Our westernisation was one of enthusiasm, but also of naivety. In a sense, we were like Aeneas, the hero of Greco-Roman mythology, forced to leave behind the world we had known to build something new.The entire eastern bloc was one big 'Hillbilly Elegy': millions left struggling with their own self-worthMore than three decades after 1989, the transformation of central and eastern Europe is astonishing. Although the fear of losing our sovereignty again has never really gone away, in Tallinn, Vilnius or Bratislava, confident, gleaming modernity now mingles with the remnants of a communist past. Clean streets, sleek new trams, and a feverish drive to renovate everything reflect not just economic growth but a deeper ambition to belong – to prove we were worthy of this, mostly imagined, west.This path coincided with our coming of age as democracies. But the experience of seeing populist rule take hold in many countries – Brexiters winning in the UK, the full-scale Russian attack onUkraine– has brought about a new clarity.It is as if history has reverted. We westernised to achieve democratic maturity. Now it is western Europe that has to “easternise” to achieve maturity in security and defence.But the global west that we aspired to join is bifurcating; splitting into liberal democratic and populist camps, between resentment and solidarity. Those in power in Washington appear to support the dismantling of the very democratic guiding principles and ideals that helped us to overcome our past misery. The same principles and ideals have allowedUkraineto resist brutal Russian aggression and retain hope of joining the western institutions.One of the two new wests belongs to Vance, Donald Trump and their European followers in Hungary, Slovakia and elsewhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And this democratic west has, for the first time, begun to share the concerns of post-communist Europe about sovereignty. People in our region have lived with existential fear for a long time. It is why Poland and the Baltic countries spend record amounts of their GDP on their military, at the expense of other needs.Now, at last, Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer and the incoming German chancellor Friedrich Merz are willing to see things from Ukraine’s perspective.The summit in Londonon Sunday confirmed it. Remember, the anxiety was not equally shared before February 2022, when Ukraine’s warnings were often dismissed as “Russophobia” or “hawkish”.Since then, much has been written about the EU’s centre of gravity shifting from France and Germany towardsthe Baltic countriesand Poland. If this is true it is because Russia’s direct neighbours were willing to take on a disproportionate share of the burden of opposing Russia and then start working on the genuine defence of Europe.ButGermany’s election, in which the Russia-friendly far-right Alternative für Deutschland (backed by Vance) took second place, reminds us that in the new bifurcated west, Europe is also divided: only onepart is loyal to liberal democratic values. It understands that solidarity is not a question of appealing to the world’s conscience or shrieking about historic responsibility, sacrifice and enormous cost. Rather it is a question of self-interest.Vance’s demeaning treatment of Zelenskyy in the Oval Office symbolised something else. Vance was once afierce critic of Donald Trump, then he suddenly switched sides. In the Oval Office, Hillbilly Elegy morphed into a Hillbilly eulogy for the bullying of those in need of solidarity and compassion. His brand of neo-conservatism looks like ordinary old-school conformism to the doctrine of might is right, strong countries despising or attacking smaller ones.With the west splitting in two, saving a free Ukraine and defending liberal democracy looks daunting. But it is clearer than ever that the two go hand in hand.Karolina Wigura isa Polish historian and co-author ofPost-Traumatic Sovereignty: An Essay (Why the Eastern European Mentality is Different)Jarosław Kuisz is editor-in-chief of the Polish weekly Kultura Liberalna and the author of The New Politics of Poland: A Case of Post-Traumatic SovereigntyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why be embarrassed about a defining policy?Tue 4 Mar 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 08.01 ESTShareOne step forward, two steps back. Angela Rayner’s employment rights bill is back in the Commons this week, stuffed with ideas for improving everyday working life: that’s the big step forward for a government that was elected on a promise of radical change. The weekend headlines, however, were all about what won’t be changing after all. The so-called right to switch off – an early Rayner idea about legislating to prevent employees being pestered by out-of-hours calls and emails, which was already presumed dead due to not being in the bill – wasritually killed offonce again for the Sunday papers, with a briefing that it still won’t be in the bill after fresh amendments are tabled on Tuesday.Presumably the idea was toreassure businessesfearful of extra regulatory burdens, on top of the looming April hike in employers’ national insurance. But since it’s the tax rise they’re really worried about, in practice it offers minimal reassurance while generating hostile headlines about asupposed humiliation for Rayner(despite Downing Street’s best efforts to convey that the prime minister has never been closer to his deputy, a former care worker who is one of vanishingly few senior politicians to have done low-paid, insecure work herself in the past). The wary, almost apologetic way the government keeps approaching this admittedly complex bill suggests it’s still not entirely sure of its ground – and that makes its opponents scent blood.What’s striking is the contrast between these domestic jitters, and the far more confident leadership Keir Starmer shows on Ukraine. The decisions he is having to take over national security, Britain’s relationship with its most powerful ally, and the inevitable consequences for other public services of earmarking billions more for defence couldn’t be more consequential; getting it wrong will cost lives. Though, for now, the public mood is solidly behind President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the appalling way Donald Trump treated him, Starmer has already sufferedone ministerial resignationover his decision to raid the aid budget for defence spending, and must know his critics are just waiting for their moment. (Nigel Farage barely left it a weekend before suggestingZelenskyy hadprovoked Trump by being “rude”).View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer hugs Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives to attend a summit at Lancaster House in London, 2 March 2025.Photograph: Toby Melville/AFP/Getty ImagesDespite these pressures, Starmer has looked resolute and decisive, capable of the imaginative leaps necessary in a fast-evolving crisis and of finding the right emotional register. There was something unexpectedly moving about watching him hug Zelenskyy in the street, but also about the images released after Sunday’s summit of EU leaders: Britain isn’t back in the union, but it is very much back in Europe. Something similar happened during the Southport riots, when Starmer’s evident confidence in what he was doing inspired confidence in the country. Yet all too often,Labourprojects the opposite: a faint flinch in advance, betraying its fear of getting thumped.That’s regrettable: Rayner’s reforms are popular, human and very easy to dramatise, because they’re about the lives we live every day.Two-thirds of voters support expanding flexible working, according to YouGov: the bill gives working parents the right to request it fromday one of a new job, and while employers don’t have to grant it if they can show good reason not to, flexibility becomes the default assumption. Crucially, that may help parents to move on from jobs they’ve long outgrown into something better paid, without worrying so much about losing the family-friendly deal that makes everything work.Two-thirds of voters also support banning zero-hours contracts, aware of the horrible anxiety caused by not knowing how much work you’ll have from week to week, though ministers must still explain how they’ll cater for a minority of workers who genuinely like the flexibility they offer.Extending statutory sickness payis a lesson well learned from the pandemic, when it became shockingly obvious how many people couldn’t afford to take time off work even after testing positive for a potentially deadly disease. And for a Labour government painfully conscious of the threat it faces from Reform, pushing ahead with this stuff isn’t just about doing the right thing: it’s naked self-interest.Starmer won his majority by focusing unwaveringly on so-called“hero voters”, economically insecure people with little confidence in politicians who voted leave in the hope something would change. He has since spent billions on delivering for them: think of theminimum wage hike, last summer’spublic sector pay risethat helped end the NHS strikes, or even Rachel Reeves’s surprise decision to continuefreezing fuel dutyin the budget, to the relief of white van drivers everywhere. Yet Labour seems almost embarrassed to mention it, seemingly assuming that those it meant to help will notice the difference all by themselves while it focuses on talking tough about immigration.But the risk is that even if people do begin to feel their lives improving, they won’t necessarily connect that security with choices actively made by the government. What’s missing is a sense of publicly going into battle for the little guy, which parties such as Reform excel at conveying.It’s true that there are tensions between stronger workers’ rights and the Treasury’s desperation for economic growth. But Reeves knows full well that rising GDP isn’t enough if people don’t feel it in their own lives, which is why she keeps saying growth must meanmore than a line on some graph. Rayner’s bill embodies the difference Labour can make for its people, in a period where good news may be scarce. It’s time to move forward, this time with confidence.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsWorkers' rightsOpinionLabourAngela RaynerRachel ReevesWork-life balanceVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

Apart from those who are directly impacted by mortgages, the Reserve Bank decision does not appear to have cut through as something that will benefit voters personally.At its February board meeting the Reserve Bank of Australia reduced interest rates by 0.25%, which was the first rate cut since the pandemic. To what extent has the recent interest rate cut had a positive or negative impact on the following?On the economic level, falling interest rates, low unemployment and the halving of inflation is a great story. But, like the Harvey Norman ad promises, the current public response is “no interest”.The inherent challenge for the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is that a soft landing, by definition, means there is no body count. “Plane lands without casualties” is just not news.Labor might point to thesurge in unemployment in New Zealand, where a new conservative government has introduced the sorts of job cut policies that Peter Dutton is championing, but whoever paid attention to what is happening over the ditch?Labor is desperate for our attention, the opposition not so much. With very limited policies and a leader who only a mother could love, theCoalitionare running small target to convince us that things just need to get “back on track”.A tell of the Coalition’s desperation to minimise our attention came in last weekend’s remarkable decision to match Labor’s Medicare rebate announcement before the PM’s speech was even over.Recognising the Coalition’s brand weakness on health (Peter Dutton wasvoted by doctors as the worst health minister in 35 years), the decision to match Labor was calculated to minimise the attention placed on the issue.A second question shows why “funding Medicare” is not the hill Dutton wants to die on.Which political party do you trust more to handle the following issues?This entire table should offer some succour to Labor supporters disheartened by opinion polls suggesting the Coalition is “ahead” in the horse race (our pollhas the two ponies pretty much even).On the core areas of Labor brand strength – health, wages and climate – Labor is more trusted. On the Coalition traditional ground of economic management and international relations it’s line ball. On cost of living, Labor is modestly ahead. The challenge for both parties is that mass of voters who see “no difference”.Which brings us to Hayes’ colourful description of politics in the age of attention capitalism – Big Tech’s business model that exploits our engagement with the world and turns it into a tradable commodity.Trump dominates our newsfeeds but even where local issues cut through, antisemitism, thwarted terror attacks and China panics are much more clickable than urgent care clinics, cheaper childcare and aged care reform.“Without a formal set of institutions to force public attention on a topic, no basic rules for who will speak when and who will listen, the need for attention becomes exclusive; it swallows debate, it swallows persuasion, it swallows discourse whole,” Hayes argues.A final table illustrates this point elegantly. More than half the voters say they are paying little or no attention to the upcoming election. Those paying the least attention are those who are least likely to have settled on their vote.How much attention have you been paying to the news, advertising and updates from the 2025 Federal Election?To spell it out: the election will be decided by the people paying the least attention and with the lowest commitment to their ultimate choice. They will cast their ballot while viewing politics out of the corner of their eye.Waiting for Australia’s election campaign to start? Behind the scenes, it already hasRead moreThis is what Scott Morrison instinctively mastered in 2019. There wasn’t even an attempt to win any debate, just a series of photo ops and memes. Then that attention became a negative and he effectively voiced the Labor campaign against him in 2022.This time around Anthony Albanese wants, needs, voters to focus on policy which requires deeper attention before they can make an informed choice. While people say they will weigh up the parties before they vote, will they be able to find the headspace to do so?In contrast, Dutton just wants our instinctive reactions. Do we feel better off than three years ago? Does Albanese seem weak when he balances nuance? Does nuclear look like a plan if you don’t check the numbers?It is here, amid the lights and the shouting and the mass of writhing bodies that the 2025 federal election will be fully revealed.Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company.

Lina, 19, outlines their master plan to meetTom Hiddleston, starring in Much Ado About Nothing. Tonight: scrutinise the procedure at stage door, where only ticket holders are allowed to wait for a chance to meet the cast. Tomorrow: watch Much Ado then race to join the stage-door queue. As a backup, they’ve bought tickets for the next night, too.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“Be prepared!” Lina declares. Are they hoping for autographs, selfies … acting tips? “Just toseehim. That would be enough. We especially travelled here for this. It’s all worth it. I just worry a little that he hasn’t much time.” She considers the arriving fans. “Wow – that’s a very big line.”One person hugged me hard from behind. I was like: 'Oh, you're literally strangling me'Near the front is Lilly, 22, who saw the first half of the play then opted to join the queue rather than watch the rest. (“I’ll read up on the story afterwards!”) A dozen others in the queue have also not watched the full show tonight. Lilly is rehearsing what to say to Hiddleston and co-starHayley Atwell, who are both returning to theatre after Marvel blockbusters. They’re quite the draw: the theatre fits about 2,000 and most performances have practically sold out. Five minutes after it ends, there are 125 people waiting at stage door.When Atwell emerges, her beaming smile is visible from the other side of the street where those without tickets are asked to stand. Passersby stop to stare; crowds swell. Still no sign of Hiddleston. “He’s probably having a poo,” says someone behind me.You might think the curtain call signals the end of the night for actors but there remains the final act at the stage door, where fans have always lingered. Opposite theTheatreRoyal is the tiny Fortune theatre, where cheers are greeting cast members for musical comedy Operation Mincemeat. I meet Liz, 29, who has seen the show several times and has brought flowers for Madeleine Jackson-Smith, debuting in a new role. She’s waiting “to tell the cast that they did a phenomenal job … that just feels polite!”Meanwhile, here comes Hiddleston, albeit to milder whoops than the Mincemeat cast. Like Atwell, he chats, signs, poses for pics. He must have done at least 100 autographs by the time he leaves to cries of despair from a queue now snaking around the corner. But there are no complaints from Lilly, who is buzzing from her encounter.View image in fullscreen‘On Saturdays, you have to be a bit more cautious’ … Layton Williams.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverThat’s the magic of stage door, where gratitude goes both ways. Layton Williams, currently inTitaniqueat the Criterion, tells me he’ll go out almost every night, “no matter how tired I am”. He thanks fans, some of whom he has known for years, and enjoys hearing what the show means to them. Lucie Jones says she encounters people “whose lives have been changed” by a show and has been “humbled” by terminally ill fans saying thank you on a final trip to the theatre. When Renée Lamb meets fans at stage doors in Liverpool, where she grew up, it is especially evident that “I’m essentially doing their dream – that was me at one point”. When she was younger, Lamb waited for Cynthia Erivo at stage door: “She had so much time – she was so gracious.”Zoe Birkett, currently in the Tina Turner bio-musical at the Aldwych, says she appreciates how fans “make the effort to find the stage door – which can sometimes be right the way around the building, down an alley” and that they wait for her. “After I play Tina, I have a cool down, a shower, take off my wig and makeup, get my food ready. I can take about 20 minutes to come out. Just to see them waiting, come rain or shine, with positive feedback, is wonderful.”But some fans aren’t here to flatter. “People can say rude things,” Williams tells me. “One person would say, ‘Oh we’re loving this but just so you know, we thought that TV show was shit.’ I’m like, how about kiss my arse?” Jones has fielded detailed critiques and requests to “sing this note that way” or “do that line like this”. Lamb says a lot of her friends don’t do stage door any more because it makes them too anxious.Sometimes Jones will come out “and there’ll be nobody there,” she says. “The next night, there’ll be 100 people wanting you to sign their programme and make videos for their nan’s cat.” The security provision is equally unpredictable. When she starred in Waitress: The Musical in theWest End, Jones was assisted by “a wonderful man” who accompanied her to her car or train home. At Les Mis, “there’s always a security guard and they stay until you’re done”. But stars can go from receiving a standing ovation in the spotlight to single-handedly controlling crowds themselves outside. Bear in mind they will be physically and emotionally drained – sometimes having done two shows that day.Stage doors may open out on to busy streets. Birkett enjoys playing Wolverhampton Grand – “love the people, love the theatre” – but it is right in the town centre. “If you’re there on a Saturday, you’ve just got to be a bit more cautious.” Williams says that at some of the more exposed stage doors: “You get drunk people walking by. People push in. I’m like, ‘Can you see this queue? Come on!’ It should never come down to the actor to say these things.” Ultimately, says Birkett, actors “walk out of stage door on to a dark street and hope that people are going to be nice”.View image in fullscreen‘Just to see them waiting is wonderful’ … Zoe Birkett as Tina Turner in Tina.Photograph: Matt CrockettPersonal boundaries are not always respected. “Everybody has a horror story, I’ve been pulled and shoved,” notes Lamb. Williams says: “One person hugged me from behind and pulled in. I’m like, ‘Oh, my Adam’s apple – you’re literally strangling me.’ When I’ve seen that person again, I’m like, ‘Please, stand back.’” The positives outweigh the negatives, he says, “but if you think you’re taking the piss you probably are”. For those who come to see him perform eight times a week? “Don’t think we need to be doing stage door eight times a week … How much time do you need to be around one person? If I’m seeing you more than my mum or my boyfriend, we have issues!”All these actors deeply appreciate their fanbase. Birkett finds that “people want to cuddle me and feel the embrace … I do love that but I will always wear a mask to make sure I don’t catch a cold.” She says it’s often younger fans who seek “some sort of physical connection – they want to go: are you real? … Because you’re so different to being on stage when you walk out of stage door.” On the odd occasion, someone has wanted to touch her hair. “I kind of have to go, ‘No, I don’t want to do that.’”In the US, the term “stage-door Johnny” dates back to at least 1890, referring to men who hang around playhouses, targeting female performers. All actors face the danger of inappropriate behaviour. In2023, Paul Mescal told a fan to “take your hand off my ass”after she groped him at the Almeida when he was in A Streetcar Named Desire. (Mescal recently took his own film of thecelebratory atmosphereat stage door after Streetcar’s last night in the West End.)View image in fullscreenHas greeted terminally ill fans at the stage door … Lucie Jones in Waitress: The Musical.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty ImagesThe “fear factor” remains for actors, says Jones. Like “when you get followed to your car or someone will tag you in something on social media and they’re really near your house. That may be a coincidence but you have to live slightly on edge because weareaccessible and we do take the same routes home. Where does the duty of care from the theatre stop?” Lamb was in the West End cast of long-running hit Six, “which is essentially an accessible girl band – people are going to want to be close to that”. On a big show, she says, “people do expect to be able to meet you”.When Williams discovered fake social media accounts made in his name, he asked himself: “Have I seen this person at stage door? It’s scary.” One time, an autograph hunter followed him back to his digs and “put a programme literally under the door. It was like 1am or 2am. I was on tour in Newcastle, all by myself.” He still looks over his shoulder after a show, thinking: “I hope someone’s not followed me.” Unfamiliarity with your surroundings means it can be frightening on tour, says Lamb. Birkett has heard of “young dancers who are walking for bloody miles to their digs” after leaving stage door.“Sometimes this can be reduced to a sort of ‘stars’ issue,” says Paul W Fleming, general secretary of Equity, the performing arts and entertainment trade union. It not only affects celebrities, he says, but also “people who are on the minimum wage” appearing in a musical with a huge following. Some fans, he says, are “treating them as props or characters that aren’t real human beings with lives. They’re working people who are members of a trade union, who have every right to dignity at work.” It is indicative, he suggests, of how society generally views the performing arts as not serious.Many performers choose not to make stage-door appearances. On the opening night ofThe Fear of 13at the Donmar Warehouse, there were signs saying Adrien Brody would not do so. Hannah Essex, co-CEO of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, points out: “Actors, like everyone, need to prioritise their health and wellbeing and may not always be able to stop at the stage door. Understanding this helps create a supportive environment for all.” Essex adds: “Theatres are committed to ensuring a positive experience for both staff and the public by working closely with relevant authorities to manage stage-door interactions effectively.”What practical measures may help? Barriers are common on Broadway but Birkett says that with the influx of A-list stars in the West End they may be seen more here – and they make it “less likely that you’re going to get grabbed” says Lamb. But barriers are “not appropriate in every situation,” says Fleming. “We’re talking about Victorian, Georgian buildings in some cases [with] quite weird back alleys.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m essentially doing what they dream of’ … Renée Lamb (front centre) in Six.Photograph: Josh BirdFleming says the situation at stage doors around the country has been exacerbated by “an asset stripping of the industry, with massive multinational corporations purchasing venues, not having an interest in the industry itself but having an interest in profit and so driving down terms and conditions”.He highlights the problem of performers handling crowds themselves after shows. “You’re not paid an hourly rate for that. But equally: is the security guard on the minimum wage? There’s a great temptation to sort of pit worker against worker. Very often [the security guards] are people who have never watched a theatre production themselves. They are not permanently employed by the theatre. They’re going off and being a nightclub bouncer somewhere else. They’re on a zero-hours contract. Whereas in the past, our members would have been on much more stable contracts and the theatre would have employed a stage-door team – a stage-door keeper [who oversees staff coming in and out, handles deliveries and has other duties] plus someone to do security.”A permanent stage-door team, says Fleming, is more likely to “understand the fans and have a bit of a rapport”. That nuanced understanding might alleviate the dismissive responses when members of the ensemble come out as opposed to the lead actor. “People who work their tails off, but maybe don’t necessarily have a following, will come out of stage door, says Jones, “and they are greeted with: ‘Oh, do you know if so-and-so is coming out?’”As soon as you walk out, there’s going to be cameras – and you might be live on someone’s TikTokJones has also found herself handed photos she is proud of but now deems inappropriate to sign. “I did a Wonderbra campaign when I was about 18. You get the occasional guy come and say: ‘Can you please sign these eight photos of teenage you in underwear?’” Lamb says she has been mistaken for other actors of colour at stage door – another reason some performers might think twice about going out, “especially if you’re doing a job that requires being vulnerable”.Birkett says that you can’t fully switch off until you’ve done stage door. “As soon as you walk out, there’s going to be cameras, you might be live on someone’s TikTok.” As a teenage contestant on Pop Idol, she became used to the paparazzi: “But I think if you’re a new actor, it’s probably traumatic. You don’t sign up for that. You’re signing up to play a role because you love acting.”The stage door is where fandom, fuelled by the razzle-dazzle of theatre and 24/7 social media activity, butts against real people’s prosaic lives. “Ninety-eight per cent of the time fans aren’t trying to overstep or be malicious,” recognises Lamb. But Fleming gives a pertinent account about an actor experiencing bereavement on tour, returning to the show after time off. “They leave the stage door with their headphones in. They don’t want to talk to anybody. This is an actor playing a secondary character, chased down the street by fans concerned to know where they have been for the past three shows.”Better understanding of the fan culture, he said, could have predicted and defused the incident. “Because this particular group of fans are going to be interested, they think they’re your friends. And that’s part of the magic of theatre – creating a world that is so special, that people believe it to be true.” But at the end of the day – or the end of the night, on a fast-emptying street in an unfamiliar town – “our members have a right to feel safe in the real world”.Layton Williams is inTitaniqueat the Criterion theatre.

Because, yes, bees are aspirational signifiers of the good life. And yes, bees make beautiful honey for, say, stirring into a sun tea (that would be tea steeped in California sunshine for approx three to four hours) or drizzling into a “beautiful on the inside” cake (which, as far as I can make out, is a Victoria sponge.) But the Duchess of Sussex, who only started beekeeping a year ago but already has “good vibes for good hives”, also sees them as a reminder to do something that scares you a little bit. Like, say, making a tone-deaf lifestyle show in a $8m (£6.3m) Montecito farmhouse while the US and beyond goes to hell in a handcart. “I’m trying to stay in the calm of it because it’s beautiful to be this connected,” she whispers in a low tone, so as not to spook the bees.The Duchess really loves day drinking and crudites: five key takeaways from With Love, MeghanRead moreOr, indeed, her viewers, who find themselves at the deflating juncture where we can finally judge to our heart’s content the contemporary curio that is With Love, Meghan. Do we really need to though? Gazillions of words, many of them predictably hateful, have already been spewed on what it is actually about, based on the two-minute trailer alone. Is Meghan the ultimate tradwife? A domestic goddess in the wink-wink Nigella vein (if only!)? A fake flaunting her wealth? Is it a cynical money-making exercise (Netflix reportedly paid the Sussexes £78m for their overall deal)? A right-on sister who genuinely cares about diversity? An estranged royal suffering from an incurable case of earnestness? Or, as the New York Times dubbed her, is she “the millennial Martha Stewart of Montecito”?Having watched the whole damn thing, I can confirm that I haven’t got the foggiest. But I do know that the duchess loves lemon zesting. And that she keeps flaxseeds, chia seeds and hemp hearts on her counter so she can dust her kids’ pancakes willy-nilly. And that she’s got impressive knife skills. And refers to herself as “Meg’” on the labels she ties around her mason jars, which are filled with whatever surprising moments she happens to be elevating. And that all those years slumming it as a freelance calligrapher have really paid off – her handwriting is lovely.For those who have been hiding in a bunker for completely understandable reasons, With Love, Meghan sees the Duchess of Sussex cooking, flower arranging, candle making, jarring preserves, scenting towels with lavender, making harvest baskets, blowing balloon arches, arranging fruit into rainbows and sprinkling dried edible flowers on literally everything. Creating “moments” is her jam. Though jam, which usually contains equal parts and sugar and fruit, is very muchnother jam because she feels the traditional recipe ratio detracts from the fruit, so actually she’s all about slightly less sweet preserves.View image in fullscreen‘Good vibes for good hives’ … Branden the beekeeper with Meghan, Duchess of Sussex in With Love, Meghan.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThere’s a lot of useless information like this in my head now that will need to be removed slowly, by applying the same care that Meghan shows when designing a crudité plate. Which, incidentally, she makes every single day for her husband and kids. And that’s why they all love vegetables so much! “We don’t all have a garden like this,” she acknowledges as she goes about the sun-washed enorma-estate with her trug, picking lemons always with the leaves on. “I fully recognise that. I didn’t grow up with a garden like this. But go to a farmers market and you can find something … ”Oh God, it’s toe-curling stuff, but hardly surprising. We all saw Meghan show Oprah her chicken coop. Her lifestyle brand was until very recently, called American Riviera Orchard, which I think was supposed to give off an Alice Waters idyll filmed by Nancy Meyers vibe, but sounded more like the sister takeaway to Chicken Cottage. Anyway, she’snow renamed it As Ever. Frankly, WhatEver would be more on brand. Because what With Love, Meghan vibrates with most is a vacuous, over styled joylessness.Harry, mostly referred to as “my husband”, features briefly at the end of the final episode, Feels Like Home, in which Meghan cooks a celebration brunch with Waters to mark the next chapter of her life. I fear this next chapter may be a hidden extra episode, but it seems to be the (re)launch of As Ever. We do discover that Harry salts everything at the table and, like a real man-prince, loves his bacon and fried chicken. Not exactly top news lines but, as With Love, Meghan fails to teach us, we all have to make and do. Otherwise, the guests are friends such as “email pen pal” Mindy Kaling, who struggles to crack jokes in such a rarefied environment and ends up saying vapid things like “What are you, Tinker Bell?!” when Meghan starts sprinkling dried flowers again. The best, as in the most real, episode is Two Kids from LA, when Meghan invites Los Angeles chef Roy Choi over and they make fried chicken and kimchi, discuss the 1990s racist backlash against MSG and reminisce about their LA childhoods. When all is said and done, there is but one aspect of With Love, Meghan on which we can all agree – her old beagle, Guy, is a real honey.Otherwise, it’s back to sweating the small stuff – sniffing essential oils, putting manuka honey into gift bags, and elevating grocery-store carnations. It’s not the activities themselves that are offensive, nor indeed the credo to glean joy from life’s small moments. I could watch Nigella dress her dining table with tea lights then jump into a black cab headed for the local deli until the cows come home. It’s the lack of humour, irony, self-awareness and apprehension of the reality of this deeply unequal and apocalyptic world that makes With Love, Meghan so unlovable in the end.With Love, Meghan is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMeghan, the Duchess of SussexreviewsShareReuse this content"

Place your bets early but please don’t blame us come 2026 …Key takeaways from Oscars 2025: Brody beats orchestra, Brits keep it classy and Kieran Culkin botches his big momentRead moreJeremy Allen WhiteView image in fullscreenJeremy Allen White in Deliver Me from Nowhere.Photograph: Mark Seliger/Photo by Mark SeligerWhileAdrien Brodymight have beatenTimothée Chalametto thebest actorOscar, it was likely by a whisker with the latterhaving wonthe Screen Actors Guild award the Sunday before. Chalamet’s performance as Bob Dylan inA Complete Unknownwas the latest in a long line of music biopic transformations that sparked the interest of voters (previous winners have included Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury, Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Renée Zellweger as Judy Garland) and almost as if it were made to be released as part of a boxset, here comes the similarly pitched Bruce Springsteen version. The Bear’s awards magnet Jeremy Allen Whitewill playthe Boss in Deliver Me from Nowhere, also from Disney and also focused on just one short chapter in the singer’s life (the creation of 1982’s Nebraska). While White might not look all that much like Springsteen, there’s reason to assume big things: it comes from Scott Cooper, who previously directed Jeff Bridges to an Oscar in 2009’s Crazy Heart and co-stars the recent Oscar nominee Jeremy Strong as Jon Landau as well as the British favourite Stephen Graham as the musician’s father.Julia RobertsView image in fullscreenJulia Roberts.Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImageOne-time winner and three-time nomineeJulia Robertshasn’t been in the awards conversation for over a decade but she’s already receiving early buzz for her work in After the Hunt, a provocative new #MeToo thriller fromLuca Guadagnino. She’ll star as a college professor who has to grapple with the fallout from a sexual assault accusation made towards a colleague, played byAndrew Garfield. It’s been given a prime release date in October with murmurs of a Venice film festival premiere (Guadagnino has released Suspiria, Queer, A Bigger Splash, I Am Love and Bones and All there previously) and reactions froma recent test screeningsuggest it will be a major conversation-starter.Regina HallView image in fullscreenRegina Hall.Photograph: Valérie Macon/AFP/Getty ImagesThere’s only one film inPaul Thomas Anderson’s credits that didn’t receive a single Oscar nomination – Punch-Drunk Love, unfairly I would add – so it’s safe to assume that whatever he makes, however low key it might be (even Licorice Pizza received a best picture nod), the Academy will take notice. His next is his unfathomably biggest to date, the $130m-budget chase comedy One Battle After Another, which releases everywhere, including Imax, this summer, an uncharacteristic gambit for the writer-director. He has recruited Oscar winnersLeonardo DiCaprio,Sean PennandBenicio del Torobut also, most intriguingly, Regina Hall. The frequently underused comedic talent, best known for the Scary Movie and Best Man franchises, will play the female lead, reportedly the ex-love interest of Penn’s deranged white supremacist and new beau of DiCaprio’s lead, and while it’s been likened to the high-energy antics of Something Wild, after the success of Anora, another crowd-pleasing pursuit comedy, don’t count this out. Hall has long shown herself to be not just extremely funny but also extremely charming (check out 2018’s indie darling Support the Girls) so this could be the leveling up she deserves.Colin FarrellView image in fullscreenColin Farrell.Photograph: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagicColin Farrellwas close to scoring his first win from his first ever Oscar nomination when he lost to The Whale’s Brendan Fraser in 2023 (he’d already won the Golden Globe) but in the time since, he’s become a surprise TV darling. For his performance in critically approved DC hitThe Penguin, he’s won multiple awards and his charming onstage speeches may very well be a preview of what we could expect next year. He’s leading Netflix’s The Ballad of a Small Player, a Lawrence Osborne adaptation from Edward Berger, the German director of All Quiet on the Western Front and Conclave. His last two films have amassed a mammoth four wins and 13 nominations and his latest, about a gambler and a con artist which also stars Oscar winnerTilda Swinton, sounds like more may follow.Spike LeeView image in fullscreenSpike Lee.Photograph: Marechal Aurore/ABACA/REX/ShutterstockWhile it’s possible that this could be closer to Inside Man, another genre collaboration forSpike Leeand Denzel Washington that was more of a commercial play (the 2006 thriller is Lee’s highest-grossing film), there’s reason to believe that Highest 2 Lowest could also be in the awards conversation. The A24 and Apple film is a loose remake of Akira Kurosawa’s 1963 thriller High and Low, a crime story about wealth and morality, and while two-time winner and eight-time nominee Washington may figure into the best supporting actor category, it’s reportedlyA$AP Rockywho is playing lead, the rapper coming off strong reviews for his endearing supporting turn in Sundance hitIf I Had Legs I’d Kick You. A summer release could lead to a Cannes premiere and after arecord showingfor the festival at this year’s Oscars, that could lead all the way to the Dolby Theatre …Amy AdamsView image in fullscreenAmy Adams.Photograph: Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesHer role in the poorly received dark comedyNightbitchmight not have propelled her into this most recent Oscar race (although she did receive a Golden Globe nod) but with six Oscar nominations under her belt,Amy Adamsremains a safe bet for more. She has two films that could be contenders this year, both from directors who have previously netted their female actors nominations. First it’sTaika Waititi’s adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro’s dystopian sci-fi novel Klara and the Sun, in which Adams will star alongside Jenna Ortega and Natasha Lyonne. Then there’s the more conventionally Oscar-friendly At the Sea, from Pieces of a Woman director Kornél Mundruczó, in which Adams will play a woman who has just left rehab.Noah BaumbachView image in fullscreenNoah Baumbach.Photograph: C Flanigan/imageSPACE/REX/ShutterstockThere are many reasons to be concerned about an auteur deciding to partner with Netflix but with 2019’sMarriage Story,Noah Baumbach’s sad and spiky divorce saga, we saw one of the upsides. The film, which despite the presence of Scarlett Johansson would have remained a boutique release elsewhere, was suddenly everywhere, the subject of countless gifs and memes but most importantly watched by millions. It also became Baumbach’s most rewarded film and after further recognition for his work on Barbie, he’s made his true follow-up (White Noise doesn’t count), the star-studded comedy Jay Kelly. Like many of his best films, it’s described as a “heartbreaking comedy” about friends struggling to grow up and features one of the most exciting casts of the year – George Clooney, Adam Sandler, Jim Broadbent, Laura Dern, Billy Crudup, Riley Keough, Greta Gerwig, Patrick Wilson, Eve Hewson, Stacy Keach, Isla Fisher and co-writer Emily Mortimer. Baumbach doesn’t really miss in this genre and so this would seem like one of the surer things here.Dwayne JohnsonView image in fullscreenDwayne Johnson.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPAIt’s often when an A-lister’s star is truly on the wane that their most interesting gambles are made: think of Sandler delving deeper into his dark side in Uncut Gems or Jennifer Lopez reaching a new career high with Hustlers. Hoping for that same boost of late-career respect he has yet to be afforded,Dwayne Johnsonis following his junky Amazon Christmas movieRed Onewith a role in the A24-backed MMA drama The Smashing Machine. Like Uncut Gems, it has at least one Safdie involved (this time just Benny as writer-director without brother Josh) and it follows the ups and downs of real-life fighter Mark Kerr, who struggled with a painkiller addiction. His Jungle Cruise co-star, and recent Oscar nominee, Emily Blunt, also stars. Johnson has said he is at the point in his career where he wants to “make films that matter” and while the Academy has turned its nose up at a number of recent loosely similar dramas (The Fire Inside and Unstoppable from last year), the Safdie of it all suggests something a little grittier.Chloé ZhaoView image in fullscreenChloé Zhao.Photograph: Dave Benett/Max Cisotti/Getty ImagesThe groundbreaking victory ofChloé Zhaoback in 2021, when she became the first woman of colour to win the best director Oscar forNomadland, was dampened slightly with her follow-up, the drab Marvel dud Eternals, a depressing next step for someone who had so much more to offer. It’s likely we’ll be given a better idea of just what that might be with her next, an adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s award-winning novelHamnet. It’s a fictional tale of Shakespeare and his wife following the death of their 11-year-old son, believed to have provided some inspiration for Hamlet. It stars Oscar nomineesPaul MescalandJessie Buckleyand comes with Oscar winnersSam MendesandSteven Spielbergas producers, pushing it to the very top of likely contenders.Andrew ScottView image in fullscreenAndrew Scott.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesHe was cruelly ignored forAll of Us Strangers(by the Baftas too, a criminal overlook) and his recent awards run forRipleywas overshadowed by both Richard Gadd and Colin Farrell, butAndrew Scott’s continued career ascendency still seems like it will include a Oscar nod along the way. It might come from his lead performance in the very awards-friendly package of Pressure, a British historical suspense drama from Working Title. Based on the acclaimed play by David Haig, it tells the story of Scott’s meteorologist, who must determine the feasibility of the weather for the planned D-day attack. The Australian director Anthony Maras knows a thing a two about suspense, having made 2018’s seat-edge thrillerHotel Mumbai, and knowing the Academy’s love for anything second world war, this could be a firm favourite.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesJulia RobertsSpike LeeColin FarrellChloé ZhaoJeremy Allen WhitefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We meet the new breed of music overseers whose anachronistic soundtracks are taking TV to thrilling new heightsMichael HannTue 4 Mar 2025 10.45 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 10.47 ESTShareThere was a time, 20 or so years ago, when it seemed as if TV music supervisors were among the most important people when it came to shaping public tastes. There were, as yet, no video or music streaming services, so music featured in a hit show could blow up as a result. One music supervisor – Alexandra Patsavas, whose work included selecting tunes for Grey’s Anatomy – became so influential that Lena Dunham’s Girls featured a storyline in which two characters dreamed of having their lives changed by getting a song approved by her on Grey’s Anatomy, most likely a wispy piece of indie electronica over which a doctor would gaze wistfully into the middle distance while another patient copped it.While music supervisors may no longer have Patsavas’s power to create new stars through a perfect piece of placement, the work of music supervisors these days is more imaginative than it has ever been, and it can be highlighted in ways it never was before: think how many times you’ve Shazamed something while sitting in front of the TV, or checked Spotify to see if there’s a playlist of the soundtrack. And often, they’re brilliant: try the perfectly judged dad rock of The Bear, or the incredible assemblage of early 1980s Black American music in the crack epidemic drama Snowfall. It helps, too, that a strong needle drop – the moment a featured song begins playing – can be a great promotional tool on social media.Amelia Hartley, who has worked in music supervision for more than 20 years and whose credits include the startlingly exciting soundtracks toPeaky Blindersand SAS Rogue Heroes, credits the rise of prestige TV with opening up the spectrum of soundtracks. “HBO and other big producers started to do big drama series that used anachronistic music in incredibly creative ways,” she says, highlighting the launch of Boardwalk Empire in 2010. “From then on, people moved away from the idea of drama being a score-led thing, in a Jane Austen-type way, and into soundtracking with really cool commercial music, lifting the drama to another level. And when the streamers came on board, they really embraced that.”View image in fullscreenPerfect with a bit of Nick Cave … Peaky Blinders.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Caryn MandabachEd Bailie, who supervised the music for Netflix’s reboot ofTop Boy, points out the effect very dramatic use of music can have on people’s perception of the whole soundtrack. “People know Top Boy is an east London drama, so that leads us to grime, trap, UK hip-hop and drill. But we’ve got cues in there from Wreckless Eric, and we’ve got reggae. It’s a far broader musical palette.”OK, but no one who watches Top Boy is coming away from it thinking about Wreckless Eric, just as no one who watches SAS Rogue Heroes is thinking about Vera Lynn. They’re remembering gunfire and booming hard rock. Bailie laughs. “That’s true.”Rogue Heroes has been peppered with startling “needle drop” moments, where the soundtrack and action marry perfectly. In season one, a parachute mission is backed by the slow-burn intensity of AC/DC’s Live Wire, while German defences in Crete are stormed to the sound of Motörhead’s Overkill. More recently, in season two, a jeep raid in occupied Italy is soundtracked by Deep Purple’s road warrior anthem Highway Star. Each time, the music ratchets up the excitement, but also produces an uncomfortable sensation: should brutal, unforgiving warfare be this exciting? And for those thinking it all sounds a bit metal, The Fall, Bauhaus, MC5 and more are also used to great effect.For both Peaky Blinders and SAS Rogue Heroes, Hartley focused on anachronistic music: the former, set a century ago, used dark and brooding singer-songwriters, such as Nick Cave andPJ Harvey. The latter, set in the second world war and based on Ben Macintyre’s nonfiction bestseller, goes hard on – for want of a better word – thug rock: boomingly aggressive 70s and 80s hard rock and punk, with some interesting and telling digressions.Season two director Stephen Woolfenden gives an example: “There’s a wonderful reveal of [SAS founder] David Stirling at the end of episode one with The Teams That Meet in Caffs by Dexys Midnight Runners – and that’s a beautiful moment.” He’s right: the notion of early Dexys, a band of ragtag ruffians bent on their own direction, soundtracking another bunch of young men with the same purpose is perfect on many levels.Even within the hard rock sphere, Hartley was able to find less raucous moments. “One I like is She Sells Sanctuary by the Cult at the end of episode four. It’s an emotional episode, and I like the way the guitar comes in at the end and lifts you out of the episode.’Both Peaky Blinders and SAS Rogue Heroes were written by Steven Knight, who had very clear ideas himself about what he wanted, reflecting the fact that music supervisors are adamant that they are there to work with writer, director and editor, not to foist their choices on them.View image in fullscreenEd Bailie … John Lewis Christmas ads.Photograph: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images“When I’m writing,” says Knight, “I’m imagining what’s happening on screen in total. So that means imagining the movement of the actors, the words that are being said, but also the soundtrack. I found the soundtrack is a very mysterious thing that most people don’t question. We watch something, and we hear music, and we never ask, ‘Where’s that music coming from?’ So you take advantage of the fact that there is an extra suspension of disbelief when it comes to music.” So the door is open to anachronistic music.But, says Knight, modern alternative music is not just there to display the exquisite taste and outstanding knowledge of the production team. It’s because the music that might have emotionally affected the characters at that point in history would simply seem laughable to modern audiences. “So it felt like pulling away a barrier to have the music work directly on the emotions of the audience. And what I think people forget is that most of the people in the SAS at the time were in their late teens or early 20s. The music needed to reflect the explosive emotions of people at that age.”So far, we’ve been talking about “non-diegetic” music – songs that only the audience hear. On most shows, there is a clear division between non-diegetic and diegetic (what the characters also hear), but on Top Boy it could often feel as though the dividing lines were blurred. For the show, Bailie had to look not just for old music, but for new tracks and even unreleased tracks. Although he scoffs at the notion of music supervisors acting almost as A&R consultants (music industry talent-spotters) that was a decent chunk of his job on Top Boy.View image in fullscreen‘Being on the cultural pulse was really important’ … Kane Robinson in Top Boy.Photograph: Chris Harris/Netflix“One aspect of the A&R thing that’s always tricky is production turnaround. By the time we’ve picked the song, mixed it, mastered it, then waited the many months before the show is finally released, the track will likely be out, unless you can get them to hold it back. We are so beholden to our benefactors who help point us towards great music – the A&R people, the managers, the sync agents, the people in record stores. And for Top Boy that was a really deep dive, because being on the cultural pulse was really important.”What music supervisors don’t want is to create new cliches, or to select something too on the nose. “I’ve ruined any pleasure I might get from watching TV drama,” says Hartley, “because all I do is watch it and think about the music.” Bailie, though, did create a TV music cliche, as one of the music team behind the John Lewis Christmas ads. “It morphed and manifested into ukulele songs with slightly annoying, cutesy voices behind them. And that wasn’t what we were doing, but that’s how other people emulated it. But you always want to build your own thing.”Maybe SAS Rogue Heroes will create a new cliche of AC/DC, the Saints and the Stooges becoming the soundtrack to the second world war. If so, you know who to blame.Explore more on these topicsMusicTelevisionPeaky BlindersTop BoyMotorheadAC/DCPJ HarveyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Around them, forming a huge C-shaped courtyard, rises a five-storey stack of streets in the sky, where signs advertise everything from yoga and dance studios to skincare clinics, barbecue restaurants and computer programming classes for kids. A long, sloping ramp connects the different levels, knitting the structure together in a zigzag promenade that culminates on the roof, framing views out over the sprawling Chinese megacity ofChengdu.This multi-levelled landscape of leisure, culture and commerce,known as West Village, is the work of architectLiu Jiakun, who has been named as the recipient of this year’s Pritzker prize, the world’s highest accolade in architecture. His is a name that few outside China will know, and yet within the country he is respected as one of the masters of his generation. Over the last four decades he has quietly built an exemplary body of work, mostly in the south-west province of Sichuan, ranging from museums and universities to public spaces and urban plans. Each of his projects channels the spirit of its place, forming carefully crafted backdrops to everyday life – free from the bombast and swagger of much contemporary architecture in China.View image in fullscreenMulti-levelled wonder … aerial view of West Village by Liu Jiakun.Photograph: CHIN HYOSOOK“I became an architect by accident,” says Liu, speaking through a translator in his studio in Chengdu. Like the man, his office is unassuming, housed in a nondescript tenement building where he also runs a small cafe and gallery. “My teacher told me that the subject would allow me to practise drawing, but I didn’t know more than that when I applied for university.”He is only the second Chinese citizen to receive the Pritzker prize, followingWang Shu in 2012, which is hardly surprising, given that private practice was outlawed in China until the 1990s. The jury praised Liu’s ability to use “Chinese tradition without nostalgia, but as a springboard for innovation”, creating “new architecture that is at once a historical record, a piece of infrastructure, a landscape and a remarkable public space.”Born in 1956, on the eve of the great Chinese famine, Liu spent much of his childhood at the hospital where his mother worked. He was sent to the countryside for three years during the Cultural Revolution to work the land, and applied to university when the institutions reopened in the late 1970s. On graduation in 1982, he worked briefly at the state-run Chengdu Architectural Design and Research Institute, but found the experience dispiriting. “It was a day job,” he says, “but my real interest was in writing.”He left architecture and spent the next decade in Tibet and China’s western province of Xinjiang, where he practised painting, writing and meditation, producing several works of fiction. His dystopian 1999 novel, Bright Moonlight Plan, followed an architect’s futile struggle to build an ideal new town, taking inspiration from Le Corbusier’s tyrannicalRadiant Cityplan (which would have bulldozed the centre of Paris) and the Soviet and Chinese communist revolutions.View image in fullscreenPerched by a river in a bamboo forest … inside Luyeyuan Stone Museum.Photograph: Jiakun Architects“There is an intrinsic relationship between architecture and literature,” says Liu. “Both involve the observation of society, and acute attention to human behaviour.” Both also require patience: it took 15 years to see his novel published inChina.Liu finally returned to architecture in his 40s, setting up his practice in 1999, after his interest was rekindled by visiting an exhibition with an old classmate. Private architecture practice was still a novelty in China, and Liu provocatively named his studio after his given name, Jiakun – a bold, personal contrast to the anonymity of the state-owned design institutes. “It seemed like a simple choice to me,” he says, “but people thought it was a pretentious, daring move at the time.”His first building, completed in 2002, wasthe small Luyeyuan Museum, for a private collection of ancient Buddhist sculptures, set by a river in a bamboo forest on the outskirts of Chengdu. Reached via a meandering path through the forest, which rises to a bridge across a lotus pond, it has the air of encountering a lost ruin, its austere, raw concrete volumes sliced open to channel natural light across the exhibits. His series of buildings for the campus of theSichuan fine arts institute, completed in 2004, have a similarly monolithic quality, standing as a cluster of chiselled redbrick volumes on a hilltop, their pitched and butterfly roofs giving them the look of a rocky outcrop.View image in fullscreen‘I always start by finding out what the local construction workers can do’ … Liu Jiakun.Photograph: Tom Welsh for The Hyatt Foundation:The Pritzker Architecture PrizeLiu received national attention following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, which killed around 70,000 people, when he utilised some of the rubble, mixed with local wheat fibre and cement, to produce what he called“rebirth bricks”. He says: “When I visited the disaster site, I saw mountains of debris. They had to rebuild everything very quickly, and I realised the materials were right there. It was cheaper, more efficient, and stronger than using new bricks.” More than just recycling, these bricks were a poetic metaphor for the rebirth of both the material and the spiritual rebirth of the community at a time of national mourning.They became a signature of his work, most notably at theShuijingfang Museumin Chengdu, an atmospheric extension to a historic baijiu distillery, completed in 2013. In the production of the fiery white spirit, workers shovel fermenting grains into great steaming heaps inside Liu’s concrete-framed warehouses, filling the air with a sweet alcoholic scent, while daylight and fresh air filter in through clever “dragon’s mouth” shafts in the roof, designed to mimic similar features in the existing timber-framed buildings. The rugged grey bricks are offset by concrete imprinted with woven bamboo mats, used to line the formwork, adding a finer human grain to the structure.“It’s a cheap material that you can find anywhere in Sichuan,” says Liu. “I always start by finding out what the local construction workers can do, and then I design with that in mind.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDesign ReviewFree monthly newsletterOriginal, sustainable ideas and reflection from designers and crafters, plus clever, beautiful products for smarter livingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Economies were needed on this gigantic project, which covers an entire city block, stretching over 200 metres long. “I think of it like a big Sichuan hotpot,” says Liu, “combining every aspect of city life.” Recalling the plot of his novel, it was an attempt to build his own kind of urban utopia, with sports facilities, restaurants, galleries and all the things you might find on a high street. “I wanted to bring the life of the street all the way up the building,” he says.The project was a victim of its own success. After 9,000 people decided to promenade along the rooftop walkway one clear day in 2016, the authorities closed off the ramp. It was still blocked off during my visit in 2023, sadly leaving many of the upper units vacant. But Liu says it reopened again last year and life is gradually returning.His team are watched over by three cats: Huahua (Mixed), Duidui (Cross-eyed) and Xiao San (Little Third)Other notable projects include an enigmaticclock museumin Chengdu, which culminates in a momentous circular courtyard, evoking a sundial, and abrick museumin Suzhou. More recently, he has completed the revitalisation of ahistoric temple neighbourhood in Lishui, and the renovation ofa dramatic cliffside cave complex in Luzhou– both of which stitch together historic fabric with slender steel and bamboo pavilions.Back in his studio, Liu’s small team is now busy working on their biggest project yet:the transformation of a former steelworks into a park, in the eastern city of Hangzhou, rambling across a 45-hectare site. Watched over by the three beloved office cats – Huahua (Mixed), Duidui (Cross-eyed), Xiao San (Little Third), who appear, Godzilla-like, in various drawings and models – the architects refine the design of additions and walkways that will thread their way through the industrial site. Like much of Jiakun Architects’ work, it will be a subtle combination of old and new, using careful interventions to reveal the complex layers of history, allowing the place’s stories to be told, without shouting at full volume.“I always aspire to be like water,” says Liu, “to permeate through a place without carrying a fixed form of my own and to seep into the local environment and the site itself. Over time, the water gradually solidifies, transforming into architecture, and perhaps even into the highest form of human spiritual creation. Yet it still retains all the qualities of that place, both good and bad.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureChinaAwards and prizesAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 2020, Blight was beginning work on his next book, about the life of the writer and civil rights activistJames Weldon Johnson. Then, his college president called.“Peter Salovey called me up, in the depths of Covid, and said: ‘Would you lead, manage and write the history of Yale and slavery?’”It was the year of the police murder of George Floyd, and surging protests for racial justice. Other universities –Georgetown,Harvard,Brown,Princeton– were exhuming and examining the role of slavery in their pasts.David Blight on Frederick Douglass: ‘I call him beautifully human’Read more“I didn’t want to spend years of my life studying Yale,” Blight says. “I had another book I had started … I gulped. But I didn’t really have a choice. I run theCenterfor the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition. So I said: ‘Yes, but I don’t want to write a report, which is what all the other universities are doing, it’s full of statistics, it’s full of policy options and yada yada. Let’s write a real narrative history. Let’s dig into the archives and tell the truth.’“And [Salovey] loved the idea. And for the next three years, I had a small research team, I had two or three of Yale’s most brilliant librarians, and that’s exactly what we wrote, a narrative history, and not once did Salovey or anybody in his administration try to control it.”History is a sensitive thing. As Blight and his team set to work, controversy raged overthe 1619 Project, Nikole Hannah-Jones’s recasting of American history to begin when the first enslaved Africans set foot in Virginia. Historians debated. Culture warriors went on the offensive.Harvard was grappling with the issue ofreparations. Yale was not entirely sanguine. Blight “did get queries from the general counsel’s office once in a while. ‘Can you tell us what’s coming here,’ that sort of thing. But that’s their job. That’s fine. No one tried to control a single word of what we did.” The result isYale and Slavery: A History, a necessary, hugely readable work. Most of the compelling, starkly lyrical text is Blight’s. But it was a true collaborative effort.“I wrote nine chapters,” Blight says. “Hope McGrath wrote the two late 19th-century chapters and a series of interludes, and Mike Morand wrote the 1831 chapter” about a failed effort to establish a Black college in New Haven. “They were both deeply embedded in theBeinecke Libraryand the sources, and we all edited each other.”The story begins in 17th-century Connecticut, amid the brutal subjugation of Native tribes by English settlers. Yale was founded in 1701, the start of the century in which the transatlantic slave trade reached its terrible height. Blight’s introduction puts the case succinctly: “A multitude of Yale University’s founders, rectors and early presidents, faculty, donors, and graduates played roles in sustaining slavery, its ideological underpinnings, and its power.” He and his fellow authors take the story to the 20th century.View image in fullscreenThe quad at Yale University.Photograph: Tribune Content Agency LLC/AlamyThe paperback is out, anexhibitionat the New Haven Museum has closed. But just as Blight says there is work still to do – “there could be a second volume that takes the story of race at Yale through the 20th century and into the 21st … there are going to be plaques, possibly a major memorial, kiosks around the campus” – so he points out that the Yale and Slavery Project really began years before the George Floyd summer.“Charleston was the turning point,” Blight says, referring to the killing of nine Black peopleat a church in South Carolinain 2015. “In June, it’ll be a decade since the massacre at Emanuel AME, and that was what prompted Peter Salovey to initiate campus discussion of the Calhoun name, which led to two years of turmoil.”John C Calhounwas a South Carolina congressman and senator who became secretary of war, secretary of state, a presidential candidate and vice-president to John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. A ferocious champion of slavery, in the 1830s Calhoun pushed the US to the brink of civil war. From 1933, his name adorned a Yale college. In 2017, amid the turmoil Blight cites, the college was renamed forGrace Murray Hopper, the great computer scientist.Other colleges still bear slave-owners’ names. Other reminders linger. The final chapter of Yale and Slavery, written by Blight, concerns the university civil war memorial. Erected in 1915, it was a monument to “lost cause” revisionism, treating northern and southern soldiers alike, mentioning slavery nowhere. In 2020, as Blight got to work, protesters across the US vandalized orpulled downstatues and memorials to the contested past. Authoritiesremoved others. At Yale, the civil war memorial stands unchanged – but with an informational display installed.“I’m not advocating removal of anything,” Blight says. “If [Yale and Slavery] leads toward more renaming of this or that site, so be it … [but] this war memorial is deeply embedded inside a major building here, and a major thoroughfare through campus. You could blast it out of there, I suppose, but that would be a tragedy. Better to explain, interpret and revise.”Yale and Slavery does so. Black Americans are profiled, prominent among them William Grimes,authorof “the first slave narrative by an American-born Black person”, the son of a revolutionary war veteran who escaped slavery in Savannah, Georgia, then lived a long and picaresque life in New Haven.View image in fullscreenDavid Blight.Photograph: HandoutBlight’s book also sheds light on links between New Haven (“and all the New England port cities, really”) and the sugar plantations of the British West Indies, a culture apart from the cotton fields of the American south but every bit as brutal. Blight highlights a quote from Benjamin Silliman Sr, a Yale professor who in 1833 obtained a federal commission to study sugar plantations in Louisiana.To a fellow professor making a research trip, Silliman wrote: “Open your eyes and ears to every fact connected with the actual condition of slavery everywhere – but do not talk about it – hear and see everything but say little.”Silliman, Blight says, was undoubtedly “a great scientist, often credited with bringing the natural sciences into university curriculums. He was here for 50, 60 years. But when we found that quote, [we thought], ‘Oh my God, that’s the epigraph.’ He’s telling his colleague: ‘Learn everything you can about slavery, but don’t tell anybody.’ And that kind of became the mode of thought, or even a modus operandi, maybe for Yale itself. Study this, but be careful talking about it. A kind of deeply concerted moderation.“And then we found Silliman had a Black research assistant, Robert Park, for something like 30 years, a guy from right here in New Haven, who may have been born a slave. We never figured that out. But you get a sense of how deeply embedded certain ideas were in this place. And Silliman,he has a statue, right up on Science Hill. And yes, a college named for him too.”Silliman came from a slaveholding family. He condemned slavery, but as Blight writes, as with many New Englanders, he remained “trapped in a memory he could neither silence nor control”.‘It stops you cold’: the 272 enslaved people sold to fund GeorgetownRead moreRecently, at Yale and elsewhere, student protest has focused on other issues – prominently Israel’s war in Gaza. But slavery and its legacy remain raw and relevant, especially as Donald Trump’s return to power triggers new attacks on progressive campus initiatives, including attempts to reckon with the racism and its place in American history.Colleges must tread lightly. Yale and Slavery is a major work of history but as Blight notes, it was not sent out for review: “They didn’t want publicity, at first. They wanted to somehow see what the reaction was without it.”When it comes to slavery’s lingering ghost, publicity can be uncomfortable. A few years ago, when Grace Hopper College was still named for John C Calhoun, a window in its dining hall showed romanticized images of enslaved people at work in southern fields. A Black college worker took a broom handle and smashed the panes. Reporters descended. Controversy flared. The stafferwas not prosecuted. The glass was not restored.Yale and Slavery isout nowExplore more on these topicsHistory booksSlaveryYale UniversityRaceUS universitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She explains why she gave up a career in fashion to paint seriously – and why thumbs are better than brushesTue 4 Mar 2025 05.52 ESTLast modified on Tue 4 Mar 2025 08.11 ESTShareBianca Raffaellais showing me the huge canvases she has painted for her debut solo showFaint Memorieswhen a strange realisation hits me. I can see these beautiful depictions of petals and stems in their full, widescreen splendour – and she can’t.The 32-year-old was born with congenital toxoplasmosis and is registered blind: her vision is largely limited to her left eye, through which she can only see things closer than a metre and for brief moments of time. “When I back away from a painting, I never see it in full,” says Raffaella. “I work really close and I will see things for a fraction of a second and then it’s lost.”There are people who can see everything, even out into space with 20/20 vision – but they can’t make beautiful artTracey EminBeing partially sighted to such a degree can be an overwhelming and isolating experience, she says. Yet it hasn’t prevented her from becoming an artist. In fact, the works in this show all come from Raffaella’s attempts to convey her unique way of perceiving the world.The paintings in Faint Memories focus on nature – flowers, petals, stems, sometimes in a ghostly white, at other times dotted with little bursts of colour. But spend time with them and you realise there’s more going on here than simple still lifes. The painting Viewless Wings (all the paintings are named after lines fromJohn Keats’s Ode to a Nightingale) might look like an explosive bloom of dusty pink, green and white but it’s actually a depiction of just one flower. Raffaella has a condition called pendular nystagmus which means her eyeball, and hence her vision, is in constant motion. That one flower will move around, captured only for a brief moment at a time. “I see things in very short bursts, almost like a pulse,” Raffaella explains.View image in fullscreenTransitory things … Raffaella’s Viewless WingsPhotograph: Antonio ParenteElsewhere, Raffaella uses silver leaf paint in order to depict the light interference in her visual field (“there’s a constant kind of a halo or shard of white that comes into my field and I’m trying to see around it”) and thick impasto as a nod to her reliance on touch. With such limited sight, often Raffaella’s best way of observing a flower is through her hands.“A small object in your hand has a vast amount of information,” she says, “but fully sighted people often don’t touch things because their sight is their primary sense.”Viewers are not permitted to touch these artworks, although often they express a desire to do so. Raffaella is hoping to create a properly tactile work for her next show, maybe out of paper, that will slowly degrade as viewers interact with it – much like a flower eventually disintegrates after being rolled around in someone’s hand. Nature, sight, joy – Raffaella’s work reminds us that these things are transitory for all of us. She perhaps just has a keener sense of it: as a child reading braille, she remembers how the pages might last for only three or four reads before the fragile dots were pressed back into the paper surfaces.Raffaella grew up around art – her mother is a painter, too, and Raffaella recalls feeling a closeness with Monet’s water lilies, which were painted when cataracts were limiting the French impressionist’s own vision (“He just picked out what he could see”). A decision to pursue fashion as a career ended up leaving her feeling creatively unfulfilled (“It was so commercial”). And so, during lockdown, she started painting seriously.View image in fullscreen‘I paint what I relate to’ … Bianca Raffaella’s Murmurous ShadowsPhotograph: Antonio ParenteRaffaella has a unique way of working, scooping up acrylic in her hands and pushing it around the canvas with her fingers and thumbs. “Your hands are a great tool to use,” she enthuses. “The marks you can get with just, like, a thumb gesture or a scratch of a line.”She stays close to the canvas, feeling her way around it, applying wet paint to a wet board. Raffaella likes to work quickly: ideally, a painting will be completed within a day because it’s all mapped out in her head and once things start to dry it’s harder to navigate. Sometimes, she can lose her place on the canvas – which is frustrating, but often helps relay her perspective more accurately. She points out to me how none of the flowers in her work are grounded – they float without soil or grass or even stems sometimes, a reflection of her untethered experience.In 2023, Raffaella started a place atTEAR, the artist residency run by Tracey Emin, and she credits Emin – who was unaware of Raffaella’s backstory when she first saw her art – with having a “transformative” effect on her work: “I learned so much about who I wanted to be as an artist, what story I wanted to tell and how I wanted other low-visioned artists to be able to tell their own stories, too.”During a recent talk about Raffaella’s work, Emin told the audience: “There are people who can see everything – they can see out into space with 20/20 vision. But they can’t make beautiful, soulful art.”Indeed, while Raffaella’s paintings emanate the joy of nature, there’s also a sadness to them: she’s painting the world as she sees it, but also conveying a sense of what she’s lost. “I’m a really positive person,” says Raffaella. “But there are moments where I wish I could access things that I know, or can imagine, a fully sighted person will just take for granted.”A partially sighted painter is not something everyone understands. Raffaella is often asked why she doesn’t turn to sculpture instead – to make use of her well-developed sense of touch. But there’s nothing more horrible, she says, than having clay drying over your fingers when you rely on them so heavily to interact with the world. Others have suggested that, with her limited vision, she could create abstract works instead, perhaps not realising that the artist behind these delicate paintings has a steely determination to her, too.“Why would I be an abstract artist?” she says with a smile. “I want to paint what I relate to! Because when you paint what you relate to, that’s your purest identity.”Bianca Raffaella: Faint Memories is atFlowers Gallery, London, until 15 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Novelists Dorothy Koomson and Eve Ainsworth will appear on a separate panel about persevering as a writer and overcoming rejection.Annie Garthwaite will give the keynote speech in Brighton, while Yvonne Bailey-Smith, the mother of Zadie Smith and author of The Day I Fell Off My Island, is due to speak on a panel of writers who published their debuts after 50.Other events include workshops on Toni Morrison’s Beloved, run by author Katy Massey, and one on graphic novels, led by former comics laureate Hannah Berry.De Waal, who started writing in her mid-40s and whose books include My Name Is Leon,told non-profit organisation New Writing South“festivals like Forthwrite are important because older women are all too often pigeonholed and stereotyped.“People assume we are grandmothers, we are helping out with grandchildren, we are winding down, we are gardening, we are going to tea dances and wearing elasticated trousers. We might be all of those things and there’s nothing wrong with any of them, but we are also fighters, powerful, assertive, active.“We are single and happily childless, we are blissfully unattached and having great sex, we are taking no shit and no prisoners and we are claiming back some of the power we gave away in our younger years. And all of these things are what we are writing about and our stories are having more resonance than ever before.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

They will be published in a collection titled The Land of Sweet Forever, alongside eight previously published non-fiction pieces by Lee, and an introduction by Casey Cep, author of Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee.Dr Edwin Conner, Lee’s nephew, said he and his family are “delighted that these essays, and especially the short stories, which we knew existed but were only recently discovered, have been found and are being published. She was not just our beloved aunt, but a great American writer, and we can never know too much about how she came to that pinnacle.”The Land of Sweet Forever “broadens our understanding of Lee’s remarkable talent” and “will prove an invaluable resource for anyone interested in Lee’s development as a writer”, according to the book’s UK publisher Hutchinson Heinemann, an imprint of Penguin Random House.The stories contain Lee’s “signature wit, that splash of darkness and those heartwarming characters for which she is beloved,” said Ailah Ahmed, Hutchinson Heinemann publishing director. “The pieces take us from Alabama to less familiar territory for Lee in Manhattan.”Just two books by Lee were published in her lifetime, 1961 Pulitzer prize winner To Kill a Mockingbird, and Go Set a Watchman, which began life as an earlier draft of Mockingbird. There was controversy when that was published in 2015, with someraising questions about the extent of Lee’s involvementin the decision. At the time the author was 88 years old and profoundly deaf and blind.Born in 1926 in Monroeville, Alabama, Lee was 34 years old when To Kill a Mockingbird, loosely based on observations of her family and neighbours in Monroeville was published. Since then, it has been translated into more than 40 languages and more than 46m copies have been sold worldwide. Lee won numerous awards throughout her lifetime, including the Presidential medal of freedom. She died on February 19, 2016.Michael Dean, a representative of the Lee Estate, said The Land of Sweet Forever will “bring us closer than ever before to the life and work of one of the 20th century’s greatest authors.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Age ratings are intended to help parents determine whether or not a game is appropriate for their children. But in practice, an erroneous label doesn’t just mislead consumers – it can be the difference between success or failure.Balatro is an award-winning poker game made by ananonymous game developer known as LocalThunk, in which the only guiding principle is chaos. In each match the player must divine the best possible poker hand out of a randomised draw, but the conditions fluctuate constantly. In one round, the game might prevent you from using an entire suit or junk all your face cards, while the next round might challenge you to achieve an eyebrow-raising score with only a single hand. As the game progresses, players accrue jokers for their deck that add yet more wild rules.It’s an ingenious premise that has allowed a game that began as a small side-project to sell millions of copies since its release in February 2024. Though players win in-game money to buy new cards between rounds, Balatro’s version of poker is fictional, and only bears a faint resemblance to the classic card game. Yet shortly after launching, Balatro hit a snag: it was classified as a gambling game.At first, Balatro went on sale with a classification that deemed it appropriate for audiences ages three and up. But then, the classification was revised to an adults-only 18 rating. The reasoning? The Pan-European Game Information (Pegi), the organisation that determines age classifications, claimed that Balatro “contains prominent gambling imagery and material that instructs about gambling”.Without warning, Balatro was pulled from sale on some digital storefronts in Europe and Asia.“This was obviously a crucial moment and we had two options,” says Wout van Halderen, the communications director at PlayStack, Balatro’s publisher. “Be de-listed, or take the 18+ rating and get back in the store Asap. We opted for the second and started preparing an appeal to have the rating changed.”The appeal was initially declined – and issues began to snowball. In Korea, the rating outright barred Balatro from being sold. In December, when Balatro wonGame of the Yearat The Game awards, the team was also ramping up for a physical release. Another appeal was filed by that version’s distributor, Fireshine. It is only now, a year later and after a handful of updates, that the dust has settled and Balatro has been bumped down to a 12+ rating by Pegi.“It’s difficult to quantify the sales impact, as Balatro’s surge in popularity may have mitigated losses,” Halderen says. “That said, the de-listing disrupted momentum at a key point in the launch. Development-wise, the rating saga took time and resources, but it didn’t fundamentally delay planned updates.”Pegi, for its part, reiterated that it seeks to apply a fair criteria for ratingsin a press release, and that any game that teaches or glamorises gambling will automatically lead to an 18+ rating. The board that oversaw the appeal also ceded that Pegi is a system that “continuously evolves in line with cultural expectations and the guidance of independent experts who support our assessment process”. To that end, Balatro’s dilemma has led Pegi to create a more granular classification system for games that depict gambling. The 18+ rating will now only apply to games that simulate the type of poker people play at actual casinos.It is a tale with a happy ending for Balatro, yet it highlights the limitations of Pegi’s current system. The appeal process was an extended one, and while that didn’t impact Balatro’s massive success, a smaller game without such acclaim would not fare nearly as well.The wording of the new classification system suggests that any realistic depiction of gambling within a game would still result in an 18+ rating, even if players cannot actually spend, bet or lose money in the game. Meanwhile, games such as EA’s football series Sports FC, which sell players digital loot boxes with randomised contents, sport Pegi’s 3+ classification. The loot boxes only have a small chance of dropping a rare item, which means players are effectively gambling their money by buying them.Even with better classification systems and streamlined processes, any age rating system would struggle to keep consumers informed about the contents of a game in the age of user-generated content. A game like Roblox, for example, is deemed to be appropriate for users 7+ – but the rating does not apply to anything created by players, which is the vast majority of the content, andcan be inappropriate.The reclassification of Balatro has been a great relief for its publisher, and the amendment to Pegi’s rules shows that the organisation is open to change. “We applaud the Pegi Experts Group on their commitment to develop a more granular set of classification criteria as indie games continue to stretch into new ideas and concepts,” Halderen says.“We believe it is a sign of a healthy classification board that it evolves in line with cultural expectations and continues to ensure that audiences understand the type of content present in games.”Explore more on these topicsGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

His suit, filed in Alabama, where she lives, names both the woman and her lawyers Tony Buzbee and David Fortney.Lawyers for Jay-Z said that the woman “voluntarily admitted directly to representatives of Mr Carter that the story brought before the world in court and on global television was just that: a false, malicious story”.The woman admitted in an NBC News interview that she had “made some mistakes” in her allegations. She claimed her father picked her up after the alleged assault, but he did not recall doing so. She also claimed to have spoken to a musician at the after party who was on tour elsewhere at the time.The new lawsuit brings a defamation claim against her as a result, accusing her of malicious prosecution. It states that Jay-Z suffered reputational damage and that his company Roc Nation lost more than $20m as a result.Buzbee said in a statement that Jay-Z’s suit has “no legal merit”.He claimed that the quotes attributed to her in the new lawsuit were “completely made up, or they spoke to someone who isn’t Jane Doe. This is just another attempt to intimidate and bully this poor woman that we will deal with in due course. We won’t be bullied or intimidated by frivolous cases.”Buzbee is the subject of a prior lawsuit by Jay-Z, who last year accused the lawyer of demanding a “confidential mediation” tantamount to extortion regarding Jane Doe’s rape allegations. A judge mooted dismissing the extortion claim but allowing a defamation claim to proceed, but no decision has been made.In a new affidavit in that case, the woman said she was approached at home in February by two people claiming to be investigators working with Jay-Z’s lawyer, and that she refused to sign papers recanting her allegations. She added that she had withdrawn her original suit out of fear of Jay-Z and his fans, and the likelihood that “I would have to be publicly named and subjected to public attacks”.Explore more on these topicsJay-ZRapHip-hopSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsRape and sexual assaultnewsShareReuse this content"

The Nigerian novelist previously won the prize in 2007 for Half of a Yellow Sun, which was also voted the “winner of winners” in 2020. Her other two novels, Purple Hibiscus and Americanah, were shortlisted in 2004 and 2014 respectively.Social expectations on women are also explored in July’s second novel All Fours. The story sees a 45-year-old artist leave her husband and child at home to embark on a road trip from Los Angeles to New York. Soon after setting off, she decides to check into a motel room instead, where she begins a sexless affair with a younger man.View image in fullscreenWomen’s prize for fiction 2025 judges: Deborah Joseph; Amelia Warner; Kit de Waal; Diana Evans and Bryony Gordon.Photograph: Women’s prizeStrout was selected for Tell Me Everything, in which characters from her previous novels, Olive Kitteridge and Lucy Barton, meet. This is her fourth time on the longlist.Lalami, who was longlisted in 2010 for Secret Son, was selected this time for The Dream Hotel, which explores the dangers of surveillance and algorithms. Her protagonist, Sara, is travelling home from a conference when she is pulled aside at the airport and told that data from her dreams suggests she is at risk of harming her husband, meaning she must be transferred to a “retention centre”.Many of this year’s longlisted titles are set against a backdrop of politics, social change and war. In Jennings’ book, Crooked Seeds, a white woman returns to her South African home and grapples with her brother’s association with a pro-apartheid group. In Yael van der Wouden’s debut novel The Safekeep, also shortlisted for the Booker prize, the treatment of Jews in the postwar Netherlands is explored. Another debut, Fundamentally by Nussaibah Younis, is a satire about an aid worker tasked with rehabilitating Isis women.“These are important, far-reaching novels where brilliantly realised characters navigate the complexities of families and modern relationships, whilst pushing the boundaries placed around them,” said De Waal. “It’s a list that readers will devour and shows the echoes of world events on everyday lives as well as the power and brilliance of women writing today.”Completing the longlist are Good Girl by Aria Aber, The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley, Somewhere Else by Jenni Daiches, Amma by Saraid de Silva, The Persians by Sanam Mahloudji, Nesting by Roisín O’Donnell, A Little Trickerie by Rosanna Pike, Birding by Rose Ruane, and The Artist by Lucy Steeds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

One couple stutters through the non-linear span of their relationship in his playConstellations, while another travels back and forth across a decade in his screenplay forWe Live in Time, starring Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield.Here is another love story,originally staged in 2011. We initially meet Leonard (Barney White) and Violet (Cassie Bradley) in 1942, in a hotel room in Bath, with the intimacy of bare skin and bedclothes. A shyly ardent romance is commencing but stalled by war: this is the apprehensive night before Leonard leaves for the frontline. The pair plan to marry and have a life together afterwards, however long it takes.Backstories leak in through the flow of dialogue – he is a London butcher while her family run a shop. The class difference, caught in this information and their accents, becomes clearer when we meet them next, after the war. Their circumstances have changed, disappointment has set in, and they are reduced to small talk.The relationship is presented in three distinct parts, and time zones, from the night at the hotel through to 2002. As in several of Payne’s works, death is in the offing, too, but the play is not as structurally complex as his non-linear stories, treading chronologically through time to show its impact on this pair.The script does not contain the same emotional profundity either, but what lifts it are two beautiful central performances. Bradley and White bring sweetness and vulnerability to the wartime hotel room, brittleness to the couple’s next meeting and finally tenderness to the challenging ending in which they are elderly.In a production directed by James Haddrell, time resets with the help of music from the respective eras. Bradley and White move Pollyanna Elston’s set around themselves, switching scenes from the hotel room to a bench and then Leonard’s bachelor flat.There are some intense moments, particularly in Leonard’s sense of betrayal, and levity too, with mentions of farts, Jaffa Cakes and Durex. It creaks to its close, and you wish for the fast-forwards of Constellations to whiz you through a more coloured-in story, but is worth seeing for two incredibly sensitive performances.AtPark theatre, London, until 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Judging by how furiously attentive Young’s fans are, as her biggest London show vaults from rawness to raucousness, that person is pretty much in a party of one.And Young, 24, owns the chaos. After the Brit School graduate and her six-piece band open with the skeletally funky Good Books, she dissipates the energy by performing a poem apparently just written backstage, which refers to her between-song chat: “The talking parts are a fucking shambles.” Shambles or not, it’s endearing – and she has an obvious aptitude for using specificity and relatability to convey powerful emotions.There’s the overwhelming, all-consuming nature of infatuation – to the point of embarrassment – on Crush, as furious drums turn to a whisper and reverberant guitars suddenly clean up, breaking the tension. You Noticed is one of her most moving pieces, recounting her surprise at a new lover’s attentiveness after being primed to expect disappointment.Her perspective anchors her grimy south London soul, which incorporates hyperpop on Revolve Around You, here injected with fresh spoken-word energy; and punk on the high-energy Big Brown Eyes. Wish You Were Dead is turbulent and hard-charging. And in a set not short on surprises, Young turns the brazenly soulful What Is It About Me into a spotlit piano ballad for the encore, dialling down the instrumentation and upping the plea in her vocal delivery to a wail.Naturally she closes with Messy, propelled to No 1 after more than seven months as a mainstay on TikTok. Everyone raises their phones into the air to catch a clip. Her powerful vocals – cocksure yet nonchalant, cool yet vulnerable – are among the most versatile of her generation’s, suggesting she’s far more than just a viral flash in the pan, and making a virtue of her adaptability.Lola Young ison tourin the UK until 27 MarchExplore more on these topicsPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

You can’t say that about this film featuring theLondonsinger-songwriter Hak Baker. What you see is what you get with him and, like him, the documentary feels genuine and very likable. It was filmed over five years by James Topley and Ivo Beckett (working together as Deadhorses). The pair must be mates with Baker, going by the number of shots of him at his kitchen table, beer in hand, or lugging a sofa down stairs as he is evicted from yet another flat, face fixed with a smile that could raise the room temperature by at least five degrees.Baker was raised by his Jamaican mum on the Isle of Dogs (gentrification is a big issue for him). Aged 14, he joined the grime collective Bomb Squad and a few years of “parties, booze, puff and girls” followed. By 19, Baker was in prison, where he picked up a guitar and began to hone his blend of grime, folk and spoken word. The film charts it all: playing to three people in a festival field to rowdy pub gigs, Glastonbury, supporting Pete Doherty at the Royal Albert Hall.A lot of the footage looks like it’s been shot with a phone – it’s intimate and rough around the edges, but tightly edited. There’s a clip of Baker backstage at Glastonbury just about to perform; he picks up a freebie T-shirt, but then a security guard intervenes. On the voiceover Baker describes the voice in his head, always telling himself that he doesn’t deserve it. It comes from his background: “Lads thinking they’re nothing, we’re shit.” Baker’s voice is honest and sincere, his warmth unfakeable.Hakeem is in cinemas from 4 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMusic documentaryGrimeFolk musicHip-hopLondonreviewsShareReuse this content"

He looks out over a picturesque stretch of Saskatchewan landscape bathed in magic-hour glow before we cut to a welter of confusing, often blood-soaked flashbacks (or flashforwards) – and his voiceover then explains that although his memory doesn’t work so well, he’d rather not remember most of his life anyway. That’s because unfortunate Ethan is suffering from a kind of cyclical amnesia, not unlike the disorder that bedevilled Guy Pearce’s character in Memento, which compels him to keep reintroducing himself to people he’s met many times before. This is a particularly dangerous condition to have because Ethan is living in the middle of a zombie apocalypse that’s turned everyone who hasn’t gone full zombie into skittish, trigger-happy survivalists desperately clinging to what little resources they have.That even goes for Mae (Carrie-Anne Moss, who just so happened to have also been the co-star in Memento), a tough loner living in a secluded farm who seems to have taken Ethan under her wing. Or does she have a more nefarious plan in mind? Moss has one of cinema’s great poker faces, an impenetrability enhanced by those spectacularly sculpted cheekbones, so she’s well cast here as an enigma wrapped in a tattered parka. Ethan keeps telling Mae that he needs to find his girlfriend Emma (Kimberley-Sue Murray) who went missing after they were in a car accident; flashbacks fill in the young couple’s happy life before a virus turned people into human-flesh-eating shadows of their former selves. (These are slow zombies at least, a change from the recent fad for fast-moving brain-munchers like the ones in the 28 Days Later and Last of Us franchises, otherwise heavily referenced here.)Writer-director Lowell Dean (Wolfcop) takes his time slotting the narrative puzzle pieces into place with minute reveals, which is frustrating because genre-savvy viewers are likely to have guessed it all after 20 minutes. That makes it a little bit harder to feel much empathy for doltish Ethan as he struggles to work it all out, but at least his dimness, a condition not entirely unrelated to his memory struggles, is grounded in the story itself.Die Alone is on digital platforms from 10 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersCanadaAmericasScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In one level, it simply puts the displays on display via some exquisitely composed, high-resolution photography that drinks in the rooms, both public and private, where the many collections dwell; vitrine after vitrine, drawer upon drawer, archive boxes until the end of time, with beetles, geological samples, taxidermied birds and botanical samples, each one lovingly tagged and sorted.That said, the fact that the archive is only maybe 10% digitised and indexed means that the staff clock up kilometres’ worth of walking every day as they search for requested items: as such this is also a study of information science at a point of crisis.View image in fullscreen‘Seamlessly edited, fluent, thoughtful and immersive’ … Archive of the Future.Photograph: True StoryWe explore, too, the ethics of museums such as this, founded by wealthy collectors and royalty who plundered colonies and newly discovered lands in the name of science but also for glory. Reparations are made, apologies issued. While gingerly assembling the remains of an elephant for display, a curator explains that this particular beast was killed as recently as the 1970s by one of his predecessors at the museum while on a safari holiday; the skin was shipped back for the collection but most of it rotted and what remains is largely synthetic.Those who find watching crafters at work are in for a treat, with many soothing minutes devoted to the observation of the museum’s staff endlessly painting, sculpting, scanning and photographing objects. Surprisingly, quite a few of these artisans are volunteers, happy to give their time and expertise to Austrian society out of gratitude for their state benefits. Again, on a meta level the film itself is a work of painstaking crafting, seamlessly edited, fluent, thoughtful and immersive like a visit to the museum itself.Archive of the Future is on True Story from 7 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMuseums (Culture)Museums (Education)AustriaEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

The famous feud between McCarthy and the playwright Lillian Hellman – “every word Hellman writes is a lie, including ‘and’ and ‘the’” – led to a $2.5m libel suit brought by Hellman but which in the end damaged her own reputation beyond repair.McCarthy was already an established critic and fiction writer when, in 1963, she publishedThe Group, the novel that was to bring her huge popular success. It is an account of the lives of a set of young women in postwar New York and, for its time, was frank to the point of being scandalous. Anyone reading it now will wonder what the fuss was about, given its bloodless psychologising and wooden prose.It could be argued that her finest book isMemories of a Catholic Girlhood, first published in 1957 and now reissued in a handsome paperback by Fitzcarraldo Editions. Much of the material had already appeared as autobiographical essays in theNew Yorker, and in her preface here she expresses surprise that “some readers… have taken them for stories”. This is somewhat disingenuous, since at the end of each of the eight sections of the book she examines her conscience, as a good Catholic girl should, and confesses to the parts of the preceding narrative that are “made up”.I should not care to spend eternity in the company of [a god] who would damn me for not working out a deal with HimShe was born in Seattle in 1912, the inheritor of a “salad of genes”, as Nabokov would say, from her Irish Catholic, New England Protestant and California Jewish forebears. Both her parents died in the great influenza epidemic of 1918. Mary and her three brothers, including the future movie actor Kevin McCarthy, lived for a time with their father’s Irish Catholic parents, a markedly unfeeling couple. Some of the most biting passages in the book deal with the grandmother: “An aggressive churchgoer, she was quite without Christian feeling: the mercy of the Lord Jesus had never entered her heart.”Worse was to come, however, when the children were handed over to an aunt and uncle, a monstrous pair who made their lives a living hell. Among the many torments inflicted upon them was “the adhesive tape that, to prevent mouth-breathing, was clapped upon our lips… sealing us up for the night, and that was removed, very painfully, with the help of ether, in the morning”. It should be noted that the ether was employed not as an anaesthetic, but as a lubricant, which left on the lips “a grimy, grey, rubbery remainder”.McCarthy was grateful for her Catholic upbringing, particularly her convent education; as a Catholic, she notes, “you have absorbed a good deal of world history and the history of ideas before you are twelve”. Later, she abandoned religion and became a sort of agnostic. She is disdainful of the squalid bargaining the church encourages: “If the kind of God exists who would damn me for not working out a deal with Him… I should not care to spend eternity in the company of such a person.”Matters improved when the children’s maternal grandfather listened to their tale of woe and set himself to rescuing them. The price, however, was the final break-up of the family: Mary went to live with Grandfather Preston, while the three boys were sent elsewhere. The four did not meet again until they were adults.Colm Tóibín, in his sympathetic and subtle introduction, notes the similarities between Mary McCarthy and the poet Elizabeth Bishop, both of whom grew up parentless, and used their orphanhood as literary material. Yet the biographies of both women bespeak an incurable sadness and a sense of damage, however bravely borne. McCarthy was the sprightlier and more feisty of the two, and inMemories of a Catholic Girlhoodshe made a small, or perhaps more than small, masterpiece.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The hell they face will claw unbearably at youLucy ManganTue 4 Mar 2025 00.00 ESTShareFear opens with someone being carried out of a rather gorgeous house in a rather unprepossessing body bag. As is now traditional for all television dramas, we then flash back to find out how things went so terribly wrong.So, the plot proper begins when a family moves excitedly into the property, a historically significant townhouse in the posh West End of Glasgow, as befits the successful architect Martyn (Line of Duty’s Martin Compston), his research scientist wife, Rebecca (Anjli Mohindra) and their two children. They own the whole thing apart from the basement flat, where a man called Jan (Solly McLeod) lives. He has left them a welcome note on the mat – “Here’s to good neighbours.”Such an overture can be taken many ways. To the open of heart, like Rebecca, it is a lovely gesture. To the more dispassionate, like Martyn, it is a polite thing that people do. To the introvert, it would be enough to make you turn on your heel and put the house immediately up for sale again. And to the naturally suspicious and/or keen consumer of thrillers, it is enough to portend utter disaster.View image in fullscreen‘Here’s to good neighbours’ … Martin Compston and Anjli Mohindra as Martyn and Rebecca in Fear.Photograph: Amazon MGM StudiosAdapted by Mick Ford from Dirk Kurbjuweit’s 2017 pageturner of the same name, the note is indeed a harbinger of doom. A creepingly claustrophobic story of a stalker downstairs begins, dread thickening with every scene. The calls, or at least the notes, then the flowers, then the letters to the police claiming the couple are perpetrating terrible crimes against their children, are coming from inside the house. A modicum of early friendliness from Rebecca in response to Jan’s first note and some biscuits for the kids leads Jan to become increasingly obsessed with her. But the standard stalker trope is given a twist by suggesting that Jan is not simply a malevolent creep but a suffering creature who may – perhaps down to some awful experience in his past – be increasingly consumed by the belief that the children above are indeed being tortured by their parents.Nevertheless, Martyn and Rebecca (and we the viewers) know that they are not, and their own psychological torment starts to claw unbearably at you before long. Jan hacks into the family’s wifi and is able to eavesdrop on conversations through their smart home hub and watch the family through their laptop cameras. All of which feels very timely and resonant, with the rising tide of feeling that just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get you. Likewise, the couple’s powerlessness in the face of unfounded but not disprovable allegations chimes with our era of shifting truth, cancellations and online rumour crystallising into fact, without anyone even wanting to become any the wiser.Adding to the tension is the fact that Martyn is more like his hot-headed (and estranged-ish) father than he would like to admit. He repeatedly hares off to confront Jan, trying to kick down his door, shouting threats and behaving altogether in a manner perfectly designed to set the police against rather than in favour of the family. He also destroys half the evidence of Jan’s harassment, alienates the lawyer they hire and – in a move that pushes at the boundaries of what is otherwise a credible portrait of increasing horror and desperation – informs children’s services of Jan’s allegations, in a misguided attempt to get ahead of the situation.View image in fullscreenChimes with our era of shifting truth … Solly McLeod as Jan in Fear.Photograph: Amazon MGM StudiosApart from that, the setup feels horribly realistic and plays horribly effectively with our innate fears of our homes, our security, our sanity becoming undone, at the mercy of a force seemingly beyond our control. Unlike most of us, however, Martyn has a gun-loving former paratrooper of a father to turn to, who may well be happy to rebuild bridges with his formerly pacifist son by providing some form of unanswerable protection for his family.The tension is the thing in Fear, but the characters are drawn in better than average detail too. We see Rebecca’s rational side as a scientist struggling to keep her animalistic fears for her children’s safety in check, and the weary resignation every woman has felt on realising that the man she thought was just a bit awkward is actually someone who cares nothing for boundaries, and she must recalibrate her behaviour accordingly. We see Martyn’s childhood trauma shaping his responses, as well as whatever part heredity may play (and it’s good to see Compston getting a chance to play something slightly outside his usual quiet everyman box). Space is also found to treat Jan with compassion without minimising the extraordinary harm he inflicts and the potential for worse he has within him. Fear is a stylish, intelligent take on a story that has been told before but not often so well.Fear is on Prime Video nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionAmazon Prime VideoreviewsShareReuse this content"

After an Israeli supreme court ruling, villagers faced expulsion and the systematic demolition of the homes they had lived in for generations, as the army appropriated the land for “training zones”. Local activist Basel Adra was joined by Jerusalem-based journalist Yuval Abraham to film this destruction – and we witness the fear and distress of the populace up close. From bulldozing a school to night-time arrests and a fatal shooting by a settler, it’s a tough but necessary watch.Simon WardellCoriolanus (Ralph Fiennes, 2011), 11.05pm, BBC Two“He loves not the common people.” So not the best person to put himself up for election then, you’d think. But, in director and star Ralph Fiennes’ highly expressive version of Shakespeare’s Roman drama, that’s what the (literally) battle-scarred general and would-be consul Caius Martius Coriolanus does. Of course, matters take a turn for the worse, despite the efforts of his mother (a formidable Vanessa Redgrave) – and a tale of pride versus politics turns into one of single-minded revenge. Fiennes is magnetic as the soldier who, like the scorpion in the fable, just can’t deny his nature.SWLive SportChampions Leaguefootball7pm, TNT Sports channels.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightDocumentaryHealth & wellbeingFactual TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you prefer your pudding puffed up – more of a wobble than a quiver – then I suggest baking for 40-45 minutes.Set the oven at 160C/gas mark 3. Break 2 largeeggsinto a bowl and beat until well mixed. Pour in 75ml ofmilkand 250ml ofdouble cream. Add 50g ofcaster sugar, then beat everything lightly together with a whisk. Tear or slice 150g ofpanettoneinto large pieces and place in the baking dish.Scatter 30g ofgolden sultanasand 1 tbsp ofcandied orange peelamong the panettone. Pour the custard into a 1 litre dish, soaking all of the panettone as you do so. Grate the zest of asmall orangeover the surface, then scatter with 2 tbsp ofdemerara sugar.Bake the pudding in the oven for 35 minutes or until the custard is lightly set.Serves 3-4. Ready in 1 hourTo check if the pudding is ready, shake the dish – the custard should quiver in the middle. Take it from the oven and leave it to settle for a good 15 minutes before serving.You can use brioche for this if you prefer. In which case I suggest doubling up on the dried fruit and candied peel.Follow Nigel on Instagram@NigelSlaterExplore more on these topicsFoodNigel Slater's midweek dinnerfeaturesShareReuse this content"
