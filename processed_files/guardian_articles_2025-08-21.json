Originally, it evoked a singular image: a mother alone in a quiet house, mourning the departure of her last child. But the reality, then and now, is far more nuanced. While the term was once gendered, today the emotional impact is felt across all parents, regardless of role or identity.The empty nest is not a fixed state but a mutable one. For some, it arrives with a deep ache, a sense of disorientation or loss. For others, it marks a period of renewal, space reclaimed, silence embraced, autonomy rediscovered. The nest may stay quiet or grow noisy again with boomerang children, ageing parents or new partners. Some preserve their homes like time capsules; others transform them entirely, reimagining their lives within, claiming room for new identities, desires and rhythms.In the United States, there were an estimated 20.9 million empty-nest households in 2022, defined,perhaps narrowly, as adults aged 55 and older with no children at home and at least two spare bedrooms, according to aZillow housing analysisbased on Census Bureau microdata. At the same time, 18% of adults aged 25–34 were still living in their parents’ homes, thePew Research Center reported in 2023,underscoring the fluidity of modern family life.My own experience sparked this project. With three closely aged children, my husband and I went from anticipating an empty nest to the pandemic’s upheaval, when the children never left or returned soon after. These shifts left me wondering how others navigate the same emotional terrain.This photo essay explores that in-between space, homes no longer centered on children yet not entirely free of their presence. Through interviews and intimate portraits, I have documented parents in and around Los Angeles county whose nests are empty, partially empty or perpetually in flux.For many, this phase is both loss and gain, grief and freedom folded into one. Their stories – tender, complex and often contradictory – reveal that “empty” is rarely the right word. What emerges instead is a quiet choreography of change, where absence and reinvention often share the same space.Staci and PeterView image in fullscreenEmpty nesters for 10 months;one childI was a little panicked that she was going to be gone and we’d never talk to her. And it’s actually quite the opposite. We talk to her three times a day, actually, sometimes more than that.I miss her being here physically so I can hug her. But also, I don’t miss that because it comes with all the other things – the mess and the chaos.What we didn’t anticipate was how hard it would be to lose both our dog and cat soon after our daughter left for college – suddenly, the house felt empty of both our child and our furry companions. We’re still adjusting.StaciBarry and DebbieView image in fullscreenEmpty nesters forfive years;one childSo much of her life is still around here. There’s a lot of horse stuff and stuff that she collected.BarryBarry was morose for a long time. He would go down the hallway and stand in front of her room. I had a bit of a “yay” moment … As long as I knew she was safe, I felt really good.Debbie(pictured in lead image)Amy and EddieTwo images - woman on the left in a garden, man on the right standing at massive model of miniature skate parkEmpty nesters for two years;four childrenIt has been an adjustment. I like not having to schedule what’s for dinner …Their rooms are as they left them. I take a picture of their rooms and show them how their plants are doing, and I will alternate their rooms where I take a nap.EddieIt is a mixed bag. It is relief … but I also miss the liveliness. I am enjoying daily exercise, prioritizing myself, seeing clients but also finally writing. That is something I wanted to do my whole life.AmyTiza and KevinView image in fullscreenEmpty nesters fornine years, blended family;three childrenWe never had a relationship without kids. We got married when the kids were eight and nine. We always had kids so now we get to figure out, what does our relationship look like without them?It was an emotional rollercoaster. On one hand, I had extra time – I no longer had to drive here and there, and have her schedule in my head in addition to my own. But on the other hand, I felt a loss of purpose. What do I want to do now? What am I doing besides working? Who am I? What is my life? What is my joy and what are my wants?TizaCarolinaView image in fullscreenEmpty nester forsix months;two childrenI am divorced after a long marriage and am not dating anyone. I definitely used to be all about my marriage and kids, and I feel like I did so much for them that I lost myself. It hasn’t been about me since my 20s so I guess I am trying to rediscover myself after all of these years.I definitely do enjoy the freedom in not having to worry about someone else. But at the same time that gets lonely.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’TonyView image in fullscreenTony’s daughter, Amanda, pictured in the background, lives with him at home in California.Brief empty nester, home now repopulated;two childrenBoth kids have been living here for the past couple of years. My daughter’s furniture is here, replacing mine. I try to provide support for them in everything they do. I love making French toast for them. Most of the time there’s no one home, or there is someone home but there is no sign of anybody.Sometimes I don’t want anybody in the house and they are here. I can’t be myself. It is supposed to be my space. It is supposed to be my time now.Allyson and DavidView image in fullscreenEmpty nesters forone year, home now repopulated;two childrenWe converted half of the house, where the boys’ rooms were, into a second space to rent out, to havesome passive income. Our goal is to have passive income so that we can retire. My husband was not initially on board, thinking it might be weird having a stranger there. But our older son and his girlfriend moved into it, and it worked out well. They pay rent and have a totally separate space.AllysonInitially, I felt it was odd to charge my son rent to live in his room but I have come around. We want them to have an appreciation for earned income.DavidSondraView image in fullscreenEmpty nester for 3.5 years;one childThe biggest change was having the focus of my life be back on me. In general, the focus of my life is not me, because I always have my patients and I have my ageing parents and [my daughter].Everyone thought I was going to lose my mind. Because they thought she and I were co-dependent and that neither of us would be able to survive without the other. And we both did just fine.I can’t say I miss her, per se. I overscheduled myself in the beginning on purpose just to fill the time, but then I realized I don’t need to do that because I am fine. I am OK!Melanie and AlbhyView image in fullscreenEmpty nesters (first timemore than 20 years ago, and againthree years ago);three children“Empty nest” is a loaded term for most people. For us, it’s just a step in evolution. It is a continuum. You may leave; they may go away for a while. They may come back. They may get married, you may have grandchildren. They may go off and do something for a year while you take care of their grandchild. Anything can happen.AlbhyJeannieView image in fullscreenEmpty nester forfive months;three childrenI was mostly looking forward to being an empty nester and I felt guilty for thinking that I would be happy that my kids had flown the coop, but I was also nervous because I did not know what to expect.I’ve got back into cooking. It used to be whatever I made had to be something they would eat. Now I can make what I want to eat.I am definitely messier when they are not around. I am definitely letting loose. I feel less guilty about going out. I’ve been taking care of myself and finding my own joy that doesn’t necessarily involve them, but with them gone, it has been amplified.Shannon and NestorTwo images. Woman on left gardens; man on left stands at massive miniature skate park model in vaulted living room.Now that her eldest son, who has a bee allergy, is out of the house, Shannon feels she has the freedom to plant fruit trees. Nestor, with their son’s finger-boarding ramp: ‘It’s collecting dust. It’s still beautiful. And I get the emotional connection, but no one is using it and it’s taking up half of the living room.’Empty nesters forsix months, homebriefly repopulated;two childrenYou take comfort in knowing that they’re in a new stage in their lives, charting their own course. Or at least I try! A big problem for me has been stepping back and trying not to fix issues. I need to let them sort it out. I have to fight the impulse to try and fix everything for them and that’s been a challenge.I certainly have felt a shift to much more bigger-picture questions about life … When you are in parent mode, you’re so invested in the day-to-day activities of your kids, in the minutia. So once that’s gone, I certainly found myself pondering a lot of bigger questions about life, about what comes after this, and what is beyond this life.NestorWendy and JohnView image in fullscreenEmpty nesters forfour years;one childWe argue less as a couple when it’s just the two of us. For some reason the tension is lower without a child around, even if the child’s an angel – they are scrutinizing your relationship with your partner and those kinds of things.JohnI was always the “on-call person”, and after she left, I started a whole new career. I kind of feel like I’m free. But at the drop of a hat I would get on a plane and go to save her.WendyInterviews have been condensed and edited for clarity"

I think the UK is about to find outPhillip InmanA raid on property wealth and pensions is being signalled by the Treasury, and it has sound reasons for doing just thatThu 21 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 04.03 EDTShareDear baby boomer, the government is coming for you and your store of wealth. The property and pensions built up over the past 40 to 50 years are, for the first time, in play. The triple lock on the state pension might be guaranteed, at least for the time being, but for the wealthier boomer, it looks like their private assets are being laid out on a chopping board, ready to be carved like a Sunday roast and fed to hungry government departments starved of funds for almost two decades.These are desperate times and taxing the wealthy is a desperate measure. No government wants to do it. If you tax the rich, they might fly away in their private jets.That’s happened in Norway, one of the few European countries to retain a wealth tax. It’s true that older middle-income voters are more likely to stay put, but they also have a tendency to vote with their self-interest in mind. And because baby boomers are the most active age group on polling day – many of them among the richest in society – that has always spelled disaster for the party in government.There have been skirmishes in the past. This time it’s serious.Property wealth is thefocus of the latest leaksfrom the Treasury. And there is a good reason why when the housing market is gridlocked and needs to be more flexible. The Treasury is considering changes to the tax regime that will shift the burden of council tax and the centuries-old property transaction charge –stamp duty land tax(SDLT) – towards more expensive homes.One proposal is less about an increase in the total amount of money raised from SDLT for the exchequer than encouraging more transactions. The payback for a heavier tax on the sale of more expensive homes is a discount on the charge applied to cheaper ones. As the average worker discovers that moving house involves paying less tax, they will be more likely to take work in a different area, boosting labour mobility and economic growth. With more economic growth comes higher tax receipts. Bingo.It’s true there will probably be more transactions in the short term. Unfortunately for property buyers, the experience of David Cameron and George Osborne’s help to buy scheme is that tax incentives are absorbed into a new higher price and the only winner is the seller. There should be a question mark over the plan when ministers consider why many people stay put, rather than sell. And, in particular, why those who have retired cling to the family home well into their late 70s, 80s and 90s.The UK’s 12 million over-65s should be the focus of any property tax debate, because they occupy a disproportionate share of family homes. According to a study by the research charity the Intergenerational Foundation using official data, the average 65-year-old lives in a home offering more than 65 sq metres of space per person. By contrast, those aged 30 to 44 have less than 40 sq metres to move around in. Homes with three or more bedrooms are in short supply and hundreds of thousands of them are owned by older people who only use a fraction of the space, except maybe when family members gather at Christmas and Easter.Resistance to selling is strong. Older people will have emotional ties to a property they have owned for a long time. And they will often defy the urging of their family to downsize when they consider all the filling of forms and anxiety connected with it. Yet more than anything, studies have shown downsizing is stymied by a lack of suitable properties – ones that are smaller and yet have features that make them attractive to people moving from large homes.Flats in modern tower blocks designed for young professionals are often narrow and cramped, ill suited to a buyer who is considering a last-ever property, one that can cope with a wheelchair. We could blame councils that fail to take into account older people whenever they consider public housing. And the Ministry ofHousing, Communities and Local Government does not seem to have the subject on its radar. Older people’s housing is strictly of the sheltered variety and the preserve of private providers such as Axa and McCarthy Stone.But dear boomer, you must accept that your inaction has consequences. There is very little demand for the flats and small homes that might fit your whole-life needs. It appears that all you want is toretire early and cash out, taking your accidental winnings with you. Accidental because they were only accrued as a consequence of you being born at the right time, when by sheer force of numbers, your generation pushed property and share prices higher.Reeves considering tax on high-value homes to help plug hole in financesRead moreBoomers are the problem, but could also be the solution – and lessof a target. If boomersgave more of their time to local communitiesrather than jetting off on several holidays a year, and if they moved out of their main homes in good time in favour of younger families, there might be less reason to pursue their wealth.The government is in a financial fix because the wheels of the economy are turning slowly. That’s been the case since the financial crash. But it doesn’t have to be. If better-off retirees demanded smaller, appropriate housing, the private sector would begin to provide it, home sales would increase and the economy turn at a faster lick. Otherwise the UK, like so many rich, ageing countries, will be stuck.If boomers cannot bring themselves to act collectively and patriotically for the greater good, as seems unlikely for many reasons, then it will be legitimate for the government to pursue their lottery winnings with higher property and pension taxes. Still, dear boomer, it was a good ride while it lasted.Phillip Inman is senior economics writer for the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For the historical fiction stork has descended from on high with another bundle of monarchical joy. King and Conqueror (BBC) – a hugely entertaining depiction of the events that led to the Battle of Hastings – is the latest addition to that most stately of small-screen genres: the royal drama.Heavy is the head that wears the crown, though! For the portrayal of any British royal – and here we have Harold II (James Norton) and Edward the Confessor (Eddie Marsan) – is subject to a set of unspoken rules, most of which apply to the circumference of the royal nostrils and vowels, all of which must expand to fill the space available and, where necessary, beyond.But which small-screen portrayals of British sovereigns deserve veneration? And which deserve banishment to the Tower? God save this lot (or not, as the case may be):ThebestClaire Foy as Elizabeth II inThe Crown(2016-2019)View image in fullscreenCrowning glory … Claire Foy in The Crown.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/NetflixFoy’s multi-award winning performance offered an exquisitely nuanced take on the rise of HRH, from tremulous young newlywed, gasping as centuries of tradition prepare to clamp her in a constitutional headlock, to unflappable monarch, her tiny, gloved hand steady on the nation’s rudder. Even as the queenly baton was passed on – first to Olivia Colman, then Imelda Staunton – it was Foy’s quiet, beautifully controlled study that remained The Crown’s crowning glory: the definitive portrayal of, if you will, The Ascent of Ma’am.Damian Lewis as Henry VIII in Wolf Hall (2015 & 2024)View image in fullscreenA bearded love-tank … Damian Lewis in Wolf Hall.Photograph: Nick Briggs/BBC/Playground EntertainmentOh look, it’s brilliant Damian Lewis being brilliant again, whether barrelling around Hampton Court Palace like a bearded love-tank or smirking inscrutably at poor, doomed Thomas Cromwell (Mark Rylance) as his principles, perspicacity and waistline gradually melt into a gouty moral abyss. A complex portrait of the isolation and boredom of autocracy, this was a performance as muscular and layered as a Tudor turducken.Eddie Marsan as Edward the Confessor in King and Conqueror (2025)View image in fullscreenA pious mole … Eddie Marsan in King and Conqueror.Photograph: BBC/CBS Studios“Do you hear it?” he whispers, palms upturned and huge face raised beatifically to the rafters. And we do: it is the sound of heaven’s own brass section, heralding a performance of such exquisite, mesmerising strangeness, “one” is compelled to speak in terms of career bests while pointing solemnly at a vast neon sign that reads, simply, “Bafta”. Thus, we are blessed with scenes in which Marsan’s squat, oleaginous Edward chatters to “the saints”, wangs on about God, muffs kingly addresses, looks to mummy (a magnificently vicious Harriet Walter) for reassurance and generally poddles around like a pious 11th-century mole. Send him victorious!Miranda Richardson as Elizabeth I in Blackadder II (1986)View image in fullscreenQueenie, a great royal monster … Miranda Richardson in Blackadder II.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy“But surely the televisual depiction of royalty is no place for merriment,” you (a fool) cry. “It is a palace of solemnity, of august vowels and clenched patrician buttocks, by jove!” You are wrong. For here is one of TV’s greatest royal monsters; wrinkling her tiny nosy-wose at the faintest hint of dissent and greeting everything from practical jokes to executions with the same squealing, dazed wonderment; like a cartoon toddler that has been whacked over the head with a 16th-century frying pan and, inexplicably, quite liked it.Jared Harris as George VI in The Crown (2016-2017)View image in fullscreenExtraordinary charisma and porridge-y jowls … Jared Harris in The Crown.Photograph: Alex Bailey/NetflixIt’s a testament to Harris’ extraordinary charisma that the actor was able to turn a role consisting almost solely of the direction “Int: Coughing” into one of the most touching and memorable of all small-screen monarchic portrayals. So here he is, peering rheumily out of a series of royal windows, porridge-y jowls wobbling with the combined burden of … [clears throat] … duty to his country … and [cough] … bloody Churchill. Not to mention his deep concern for his beloved, callow Elizabeth as he faces up to his own, tumour-hastened [Bafta-nominated splutter ] mortality.TheworstJonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII in The Tudors (2007-2010)View image in fullscreenIntense buttock work … Jonathan Rhys Meyers in The Tudors.Photograph: Bbc/Sportsphoto/AllstarHe’s Henry the Eighth, he is. Alas, he is also Jonathan Rhys Meyers, a situation that would ultimately prove as devastating to the Tudor “brand” as dysentery. The means? Flagrant Irishness. Plus? Distressingly intense buttock work. See also: eyebrows, extended bouts of pouting, shouting “gnyaaaarr” in order to indicate vexation/gout and repeatedly smushing his chin into his chest while flaring his nostrils, like a horse that’s just been refused a divorce by Pope Clement VII.Carolyn Sadowska as Elizabeth II in The Women of Windsor (1992)View image in fullscreenA concussed wig on castors … Carolyn Sadowska in The Women of Windsor.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA Canadian (heavy sigh) TV movie, here, that nudges its snout into the private lives of Lady Diana Spencer (depicted as a sobbing bouffant) and Sarah Ferguson (a horse shouting at a helicopter through a fence). Shonkiest of its uniformly risible performances/impersonations, however, is Sadowska’s The Queen, who glides through her bits like a concussed wig on castors. Highlights: staring expressionlessly at cutlery, mechanically stirring a visibly empty teacup and not moving her lips while speaking, thus ensuring her vowels remain locked in terminal combat (“So you’re fond of horses, Diaaannaaaeuuugh?”).David Threlfall as Prince Charles in Diana: Her True Story (1993)View image in fullscreenWincing in tweed … David Threlfall in Diana: Her True Story.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyIt was a dark day for drama and, indeed, logic, when the great David “Shameless” Threlfall agreed to participate in this rush-released adaptation of Andrew Morton’s bestselling biography. Nevertheless, here, for reasons best known to himself, he is; wincing in tweed, biting his lip and saying “ngggnn” in a window-rattling potboiler that recasts the House of Windsor as [needle scratch, crash zoom on startled corgi] the House of Gits. Cue much cufflink-twiddling and a persistent, pained grimace that is less “future King of England” and more “Aardman character with gingivitis”.Max Irons as Edward IV in The White Queen (2013)View image in fullscreenAmbulant sex-piñata … Max Irons in The White Queen.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyForsooth, sirrah, with thy idle pouting and thy smouldering toplessness thou dost surely turn the Wars of the Roses into the “Wars of the Poses!” And lo, much vexation does ensue as Max “Son of Jeremy” Irons plays the 15th-century ruler in the manner of an ambulant sex-piñata, with protracted brooding sessions punctuated by the sort of explosive heritage boffing scenes in which there is clearly at least half a metre separating boffer and boffee’s woohoos. Highlights? No. Although there is a bit where he narrows his eyes and purrs, “I’m brave”. Which is something.Jane Alexander as Elizabeth II in William & Catherine: A Royal Romance (2011)View image in fullscreenPeppy action ma’am … Jane Alexander in William & Catherine: A Royal Romance.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyBow ties spin in horror as the House of Windsor is reimagined as Chessington World of Sovereigns™ in a Hallmark TV movie of such thoroughgoing stupidity it seems unfair to point the sceptre of shame at a single, poorly wigged element. Still, needs must. So here is the otherwise excellent (and, indeed, Emmy-nominated for her recent guest role in Severance) Jane Alexander slumming it as QEII; a maddeningly peppy action-ma’am whose determination to “embrace this new world!” is conveyed via scenes in which she plays Wii Sports, nods along to hip-hop and says “Kanye West” in an accent that could skin a corgi.King & Conqueror is on BBC One from 24 AugustExplore more on these topicsTelevisionThe CrownHistorical drama (TV)Period drama (TV)DramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

They risk themselves to bring new life into a country where there are nowthree deaths for every birth.Even with renewed hopes for an end to the war, Russia’s brutal tactics have fuelled a demographic crisis forUkraine. Millions of women and children have fled the country, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and those women who remained have been left fearful of pregnancy and childbirth.In 2024, Ukraine suffered the lowest birthrate in the world and the highest mortality rate, according to theCIA’s World Factbook.Map of Ukraine showing locations of 81 Russian attacks on maternity unitsKharkivThe hospital in Kharkiv delivered about 1,000 babies a year before Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Last year, that figure fell to less than 440 – two-thirds of women of child-bearing age have fled the city. The figure would be even lower but more women are attending as otherhospitalsin the city stop operating.Just five days before our arrival in late July, the maternity building of Kharkiv’s main hospital had been damaged in a drone strike. As the windows were blown in and glass sprayed across beds, the women – some pregnant, others with newborns and one in active labour – were rushed across the river to a perinatal centre for urgent medical care. All were suffering from shock, but the woman in labour needed an urgent caesarean section. Staff operated quickly and mother and baby survived.View image in fullscreenA mother with her newborn baby is helped downstairs to the hospital shelter during a night-time Russian attack on Kharkiv last month.Photograph: Emre Çaylak/The GuardianSuch bombardment has become all too common in Kharkiv, which has been under heavy and sustained attack since the first hours of the war. In June, the city was hit with the largest number of attacks since the full-scale invasion began. At the perinatal centre now taking care of women, doctors say they have delivered babies in the middle of air attacks, and carried out surgery while bouncing up and down from the impact of explosions.I was worried the hospital could be targeted, but I had no choice but to give birthOlga ShevelaThe city itself is heavily scarred by war. Broken glass lines the pavements outside the hospital, while two buildings opposite lie derelict after suffering damage. The centre’s windows are filled with sandbags, their plastic panes crossed with tape to contain any breakage. Power cuts are routine, with caesareans having been carried out by torchlight in the past.It is a lot of stress to contend with if you are pregnant. Doctors say they have seen medical complications and breakdowns – one new mother refused to take her child home after she learned her husband had been killed at the front. The hospital now employs a psychologist to help ease the fears of women who are reluctant to even come to the hospital due to the risk it could be hit.When Olga Shevela, 30, went into labour, she had to travel to the hospital as Shahed drones buzzed above the road. “I was worried the hospital could be targeted, but I had no choice but to give birth,” she says, rocking one-day-old Zahar. They ended up in the hospital’s bomb shelter just hours after delivery as almost 20 explosions hit the city.View image in fullscreenOlga Shevela, left, a first-time mother from Lubotin near Kharkiv, takes care of her two-day-old son Zahar, pictured, while sheltering with other parents and their babies during a Russian attack on Kharkiv maternity hospital. Photographs: Emre Çaylak/The GuardianView image in fullscreenWhen the air raid sirens wail, women stream through corridors towards the shelter in varying states of health. It is too dangerous to take the lift in case the hospital is hit, so they contend with the stairs. Some are trailed by nurses steadying portable intravenous drips, others cradle tiny infants. Those in the late stages of labour, undergoing surgery or who are recovering from an operation are too fragile to move and have to stay behind.Early in the war, births were improvised in what was then a dusty basement, but it has now been converted to include beds and a delivery room. It is not sterile enough for surgery but they can accommodate births and there are enough provisions for three days.Dasha Borisenko, 32, has suffered two miscarriages and is now living full-time at the hospital to protect a high-risk pregnancy – she is not due until January. She was living in a village in the eastern Sumy region along the Russian border, which is now enduring some of the worst fighting. She has not seen her husband for two weeks because they are concerned about military recruitment teams on the roads.“I really want to have a child but with this war, it is difficult to manage,” she says.SlovianskSloviansk’s population hashalved since theinvasion began, frommore than 100,000 to about 53,000. Births at the hospital have dropped from more than1,000 a year to about 550. The figure is kept higherbecause the hospital now takes patients from a broader areaasother maternity facilities have become unavailable.Liliia Eroshenko, 36, was at home and heavily pregnant in July when she heard that three Shahed drones had crashed into the main building of Sloviansk hospital. Eroshenko and her husband had delayed having a child for three years because they were waiting for the war to end, but with no sign of peace they “couldn’t wait for ever”.View image in fullscreenSandbags protect the windows of a bomb-damaged hospital in Sloviansk.Photograph: Emre Çaylak/The GuardianThey were fearful that the maternity building – a short walk from the main hospital – would be the next Russian target. Four days after the bombardment, the maternity unit has so far been spared and Eroshenko is tending to her two-day-old daughter, Milana, who wriggles in a box in front of her.With the future of the city so uncertain, she is now considering fleeing to the west of the country, but worries that nowhere in Ukraine is safe. One of her biggest fears is that her husband will be mobilised.“There is no safe place left in Sloviansk,” she says. “We hear explosions every day.”In the same room as Eroshenko, Vitalii Chernetskyi, 31, cradles his two-day-old daughter, Daria. Blinded in one eye, he is on indefinite leave after being injured at the front while his wife was pregnant. “Children are our happiness – they should be born,” he says.View image in fullscreenFormer soldier Vitalii Chernetskyi holding newborn Daria in the State City hospital in Sloviansk. He was blinded in one eye during action at the front.Photograph: Emre Çaylak/The GuardianThe hospital building that was hit now lies in ruins – burnt out, partially collapsed, with huge twists of metal roofing flung metres away. Diggers were clearing away rubble and glass when the Guardian visited, as artillery shelling boomed in the distance.The maternity unit is the last one to remain functional in Ukrainian-held Donbas, the colloquial term used to describe the eastern industrial heartlands of Donetsk and Luhansk that have been partially occupied since 2014. All the others have either closed, been destroyed or are under occupation.Children are our happiness – they should be bornVitalii ChernetskyiLying less than 20 miles from a shifting frontline, women travel from as far as 100 miles away to give birth here. They face drones, artillery, missiles and reconnaissance sabotage groups. People try to avoid public spaces due to regular attacks and endure routine electricity cuts as well as espionage – an alleged Russian agent was detained in Sloviansk during our visit for collecting information about Ukraine’s military.The maternity hospital has lost several members of staff to attacks on the city, while midwives say there are more premature births and a rise in cancers, especially of the uterus. “We saw the same jump after 2014,” says Valentyna Hlushchenko, 62, director of obstetrics and gynaecology.“Women breathe in particles in the air from the daily explosions,” she says. “They also wait too long to ask for help when something is wrong.”KhersonThe population in the city was 280,000 before the invasion and less than quarter of its residents remain.Its maternity unit used tohandle 1,500to 2,000 births a year, but now only sees about 120. About100 people have been killed and 1,100 injuredin the citythis year.In a windowless underground maternity hospital in Kherson, Kateryna Osetsymska, 35, is sitting in bed in a spotted hospital gown, her face wet with tears. Outside, heavy booms sound as explosives are fired back and forth across the river – with Russian forces about half a mile away.View image in fullscreenKateryna Osetsymska is 33 weeks pregnant and was brought into Kherson maternity hospital No 1 in July as she is considered high risk. Russian forces are about half a mile away.Photograph: Emre Çaylak/The GuardianOsetsymska was admitted a week ago for her safety. She is 33 weeks pregnant and considered high risk – doctors say there are some complications with her uterus. “I’m certain it’s because of stress,” she says.Since the start of the full-scale invasion the city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, has been attacked with everything from tanks to guided aerial bombs, drones and multilaunch rocket systems. The city’s maternity hospital No 2 has been damaged five times and now operates underground in a state-of-the-art basement refurbishment that includes delivery, surgery and recovery rooms.My big hope is that my baby will live and that they get a chance to enjoy childhoodKateryna OsetsymskaThe day before the Guardian’svisit, explosives dropped by a remotely guided “first-person view” (FPV) drone narrowly missed the hospital and hit the car park. “Kherson doesn’t have a medical facility that has been hit less than four or five times,” says the head of obstetrics, Petro Marenkovskyi. “We are 100% confident Russia is targeting us deliberately.”The city’s proximity to Russian forces means there is little chance of a siren warning before an explosion. Artillery or mortar fire hits just three seconds after launch and if people hear a Russian fighter jet is in the sky, they only have five minutes to find somewhere to hide from guided aerial bombs.View image in fullscreenBomb-damaged buildings near the Dnipro River in the frontline city of Kherson.

Doctors say they face extreme risk even coming to work; we are warned that a Russian reconnaissance drone is flying above the hospital during our visit.‘Can I complain while we’re at war?’: Ukraine’s domestic violence dilemmaRead moreThe constant stress, says the head of obstetrics in Kherson, means higher risk of miscarriages, more haemorrhages and an increased rate of surgical intervention. Things were worse during almost nine months of occupation in 2022 when people hid in their houses and women went without medical care; a steep rise in stillbirths followed.Osetsymska says she was pregnant with her youngest child during the occupation and unable to travel from her village, with no access to doctors or medical care. “You can’t erase the horrible stuff we have been through with this war.“But my big hope is that my baby will live, and that they get a chance to enjoy childhood,” she says.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He kept dead mice in his freezerDavid Lynch was an artist first, and a film-maker second (later, he’d also be a photographer, a songwriter and musician, a furniture designer and many other things). He would create works of visual art right up to his final days, but the most infamous would remain his “kits” – a pair of pieces he made in the late 1970s and early 80s, in which parts of a real, dissected animal (first a fish, then a chicken) were pinned to a board, along with kid-friendly instructions on how to reassemble and play with it.David Lynch has your number. But does it add up?Read moreLater he would tell an interviewer that he was in the early stages of planning a mouse kit, with the requisite parts bagged up in his freezer. Sadly, this never came to pass, but Lynch would continue to use unusual objects – from dead bees to cigarette ashes – in his artworks over the coming decades.View image in fullscreenHe built props for his debut feature Eraserhead (1976).Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy6. He adopted, befriended and then ghosted five Woody WoodpeckersView image in fullscreenWoody Woodpecker.Photograph: Ronald GrantIn 1981, Lynch was driving past a gas station on Sunset Boulevard when he noticed five stuffed Woody Woodpecker dolls hanging from a hook in the window. Executing a sharp U-turn, he went in to buy them. Naming them Bob, Dan, Pete, Buster and Chucko, he would keep them in his office, to make him happy.“These guys aren’t just a bunch of goofballs,” he would insist. “They know there is plenty of suffering in the world … But they tell me there’s a pervading happiness underneath everything, and the more time I spend with them, the more I believe it.” Sadly, the friendship couldn’t last – when the dolls began exhibiting “certain traits” that were “not so nice”, Lynch and his boys had to part ways.5. He very nearly directed the third Star Wars movieView image in fullscreenLynch was approached to direct Return of the Jedi.Photograph: Lucasfilm/Fox/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockThe list of unproduced David Lynch projects is long and varied, but perhaps the most infamous is the film that came to be titled Return of the Jedi. After The Elephant Man and its eight Oscar nominations, Lynch was suddenly the hot new director on the block, with offers coming in from, among others, Star Wars mastermind George Lucas. They had a meeting to discuss the project, and Lynch always said that he called Lucas right away to say a firm no, and urge him to direct the movie himself. However, writer Max Evry recently revealed that, in fact, the discussions continued for some time, and Lynch remained Lucas’s top choice for several weeks after their meeting, only turning him down when the contracts came through for another sandy space saga – the ill-fated Dune. And it’s probably for the best – the thought of Lynch let loose in Jabba the Hutt’s palace is deeply unsettling.4. He gave himself a hernia laughing at Angelo Badalamenti trying to sing‘The perfect accompaniment to life’: why is a 12th-century nun the hottest name in experimental music?Read moreDuring a recording session for a track featured on the soundtrack of his 1992 masterpiece Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, Lynch laughed so hard at his close friend and musical partner, composer Angelo Badalamenti, that he ended up in hospital with a severe hernia. The track they were working on – pounding jazz-funk droner “A Real Indication” – required Badalamenti to speak-sing Lynch’s lyrics in a growling, booming, wildly over-enunciated pseudo-Midwestern accent, which the director found so hysterical he did himself a serious injury. It was worth it, though – the soundtrack is regularly voted among the best of all time.3. He produced a whole album of 12thcentury religious musicView image in fullscreenHildegard Von Bingen.Photograph: Science History Images/AlamyIn the mid-1990s, despite the aforementioned hernia, Lynch was becoming ever more involved in writing, playing and producing music. It would be 2011 before Lynch would finally release an album of self-penned tracks under his own name, but in the meantime he’d embark on a number of musical explorations, from electric blues outfit BlueBOB, to the records he made with Texas-born chanteuse Chrystabell. But perhaps the oddest is Lux Vivens, or Living Light, an album credited to Lynch and Jocelyn Montgomery, formerly of Britain’s own sultry goth madrigal outfit, Miranda Sex Garden. Obsessed with the music of 12th-century German nun Hildegard Von Bingen, Montgomery persuaded Lynch to collaborate with her on an LP of Von Bingen’s spiritual songs, crafting a series of choral hymns backed by drones built from violin, guitar and manipulated “found sounds”, including swords and bulls.2. He was totally obsessed with Mad MenView image in fullscreenDavid Lynch with Mad Men actors Elisabeth Moss and Jon Hamm.Photograph: Joerg Carstensen/EPA/ShutterstockHaving been suspicious of television when he was younger (except for legal drama Perry Mason, which he loved) in the last decades of his life Lynch became a big fan of TV drama. It may have helped that he basically reinvented the format with Twin Peaks, and every show that came after it – from The Sopranos to Lost to Breaking Bad – owed him a huge debt. But his favourite show in this period was 60s-set ad-exec drama Mad Men. Lynch became so emotionally engaged with it that when he met series stars Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss, he was unable to call them by their names, and instead simply referred to them as their characters, Don and Peggy. “We went with it,” Moss would reveal later, though it seems Lynch didn’t give them much choice.1. He hated big tablesView image in fullscreenDavid Lynch in his Los Angeles screening room.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/APLynch was a builder – of worlds, of dreams, of furniture. As a kid he would undertake construction projects with his dad, learning how to use tools and mend fences, and in later life he would find employment as a house-builder, interior decorator and plumber. (“It’s a very satisfying thing,” he would say, “to direct water succesfully.”)Having built most of the props for his early, experimental films – including the mutant baby in his debut feature Eraserhead, whose precise components remain a mystery, though everything from umbilical cords to rabbit foetuses have been suggested – Lynch would later turn to crafting his own furniture, sometimes for a film shoot (several of his pieces appear in Lost Highway) and sometimes just for fun. He did, however, have strong opinions about what did and didn’t make an acceptable item of furniture. “Most tables are too big,” he would complain, “and they’re too high. They shrink the size of the room … and cause unpleasant mental activity.”David Lynch: His Work, His World by Tom Huddleston is published byQuarto(£35) on 11 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsRankedDavid LynchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But for Eberechi Eze, it has taken 14 years for his dream to come true. The England forward made a dramatic entrance during Crystal Palace’s open training session on Wednesday before their Conference League playoff when he was last to emerge from the changing room with frenzied anticipation that his expected move toTottenham was close to being agreed.Even if he had been aware of Arsenal’s intention to step up their longstanding interest in him, Eze was certainly giving nothing away when he signed autographs and spoke to supporters on his way out of Palace’s training ground in Beckenham.Tottenham stunned as Arsenal swoop in to agree £67.5m Eberechi Eze dealRead moreIt was later on Wednesday afternoon that the Palace chair, Steve Parish, received a call from Arsenal’s executive vice-chair, Tim Lewis, indicating they werefinally ready to act. The full severity of the knee injury suffered by Kai Havertz during his substitute appearance againstManchester United on Sundayis unknown, although the German forward is expected to be sidelined for the immediate future. With Arsenal facing four of last season’s top seven in successive Premier League matches after they entertain Leeds on Saturday, Mikel Arteta felt he was short of numbers in attack.It is understood Parish had reluctantly agreed a fee with Spurs that in effect matched Eze’s expired release clause of £67.5m, albeit with them paying less than the £60m they had asked for up front and with more bonuses included. Arsenal were well aware Palace wanted immediate funds for a replacement and were ready with an offer that satisfied both sides.Their trump card, however, was Eze. He has made no secret of his continued affiliations to the club that released him from their academy at the age of 13, even if the scars of rejection took a long time to heal. “It’s one of the hardest battles I’ve had,” he told the BBC before the FA Cup final in May. “Because of what Arsenal meant to me at the time, I had tears rolling down my face.”He was also rejected by Fulham, Reading and Millwall before finally convincing Queens Park Rangers to give him a chance in 2016 as he was preparing to enrol in a local college and start working part-time at Tesco.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze scores his first goal for Crystal Palace, against Leeds at Selhurst Park, in 2020.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/PATheir faith was rewarded by Eze’s breakthrough into the first team under the watchful eye of Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand, the former Tottenham striker who was QPR’s director of football when Palacepaid £19.5m to sign him in August 2020and inserted a 15% sell-on clause on any profit. That will ensure QPR receive around £6m from the move to Arsenal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It seems fitting Eze chose a replica of the shirt Ian Wright and co wore in the 1990 FA Cup finalfor the paradea few days later, which had beendonated by a fan. Wright, who joined Arsenal from Palace in September 1991 for £2.5m, was 27 at the time and proved he was more than capable of making the step up. Eze, born and raised in Greenwich – just up the road from Arsenal’s original home in Woolwich – will follow Kenny Sansom, Paul Davis and David Rocastle as south Londoners who crossed the river.Eze will always have a special place in the hearts of Palace fans who will not begrudge him this deserved opportunity. As those who have followed the club for generations will testify after waving goodbye to Wright, Andy Johnson and Michael Olise over the years, it is best not to get too attached to your heroes.Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fighters named in the Israeli military intelligence database accounted for just 17% of the total, which indicates that 83% of the dead were civilians.That apparent ratio of civilians to combatants among the dead is extremely high for modern warfare, even compared with conflicts notorious for indiscriminate killing, including the Syrian and Sudanese civil wars.“That proportion of civilians among those killed would be unusually high, particularly as it has been going on for such a long time,” said Therése Pettersson from theUppsala Conflict Data Program, which tracks civilian casualties worldwide. “If you single out a particular city or battle in another conflict, you could find similar rates, but very rarely overall.”8,900Named fighters listed as dead or ‘probably dead’ in Israeli database as of May 2025In global conflicts tracked by UCDP since 1989, civilians made up a greater proportion of the dead only in Srebenica – although not the Bosnian war overall – in the Rwandan genocide, and during the Russian siege of Mariupol in 2022, Pettersson said.chartMany genocidescholars,lawyersand human rights activists, including Israeliacademicsandcampaign groups, say Israel iscommitting genocidein Gaza, citing the mass killing of civilians and imposed starvation.The Israeli military did not dispute the existence of the database or dispute the data on Hamas and PIJ deaths when approached for comment by Local Call and +972 Magazine. When the Guardian asked for comment on the same data, a spokesperson said they had decided to “rephrase” their response.A brief statement sent to the Guardian did not directly address questions about the military intelligence database.It said “figures presented in the article are incorrect”, without specifying which data the Israeli military disputed. It also said the numbers “do not reflect the data available in the IDF’s systems”, without detailing which systems.A spokesperson did not immediately respond when asked why the military had given different responses to questions about a single set of data.The database names 47,653 Palestinians considered active in the military wings of Hamas and PIJ. It is based on apparent internal documents from the groups seized in Gaza, which have not been viewed or verified by the Guardian.Multiple intelligence sources familiar with the database said the military viewed it as the only authoritative tally of militant casualties.The military also considers the Gaza health ministry toll reliable, Local Call hasreported, and the former head of military intelligence appeared tocite itrecently, even though Israeli politicians regularly dismiss the numbers as propaganda.52,928Gaza health ministry’s overall death toll as of 14 May 2025Both databases may underestimate casualty numbers. The Gaza ministry of health lists only people whose bodies have been recovered, not the thousands buried under rubble. Israeli military intelligence are not aware of all militant deaths or all new recruits. But the databases are the ones used by Israeli officers for war planning.Israeli politicians and generals have variously put the number of militants killed as high as 20,000, orclaimeda civilian-to-combatant ratio as low as 1:1.The higher totals cited by Israeli officials may include civilians with Hamas links, such as government administrators and police, even though international law prohibits targeting people not engaged in combat.They probably also include Palestinians with no Hamas connections. Israel’s southern command allowed soldiers to report people killed in Gaza as militant casualties without identification or verification.Cumulative recorded deaths and injuries as a direct result of Israeli aggression, thousands“People are promoted to the rank of terrorist after their death,” said one intelligence source who accompanied forces on the ground. “If I had listened to the brigade, I would have come to the conclusion that we had killed 200% of Hamas operatives in the area.”Itzhak Brik, a retired general, said serving Israeli soldiers were aware that politicians exaggerated the Hamas toll. Brik advised the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the start of the war and is now among his most strident critics. “There is absolutely no connection between the numbers that are announced and what is actually happening. It is just one big bluff,” he said.Brik commanded Israel’s military colleges, and said he kept in touch with serving officers. He described meeting soldiers from a unit identifying Palestinians killed in Gaza, who told him “most of them” were civilians.Even though much of Gaza has been reduced to ruins and tens of thousands of people killed, the classified database lists nearly 40,000 people considered by the army to be militants and still alive.View image in fullscreenAn aerial photo taken earlier this month of a suburb reduced to rubble in central Gaza.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianCasualty estimates from Hamas and PIJ members also indicated Israeli officials were inflating the militant toll in public statements, said Muhammad Shehada, a Palestinian analyst.By December 2024 an estimated 6,500 people from the military and political wings of both groups had been killed, members told him. “Israel expands the boundaries so they can define every single person in Gaza as Hamas,” he said. “All of it is killing in the moment for tactical purposes that have nothing to do with extinguishing a threat.”The ratio of civilian casualties among the dead may have increased further since May, when Israel tried to replace UN and humanitarian organisations that had fed Palestinians throughout the war. Israeli forceshave killed hundreds of people trying to get foodfrom distribution centres in military exclusion zones.Now starving survivors, already forced into just 20% of the territory, have been ordered to leave the north as Israelprepares for another ground operationthat is likely to have catastrophic consequences for civilians.MapThe scale of the killing was partly owing to the nature of the conflict, said Mary Kaldor, professor emeritus at the LSE, director of theConflict Research Programmeand author of New Wars, an influential book about warfare in the post-cold-war era.International humanitarian law was developed to protect civilians in conventional wars, in which states deploy troops to face each other on the battlefield. This is still largely the model for Russia’s war in Ukraine.In Gaza Israel is fighting Hamas militants in densely populated cities, and has set rules of engagementthat allow its forcesto kill large numbers of civilians in strikes on even low-ranking militants. “In Gaza we are talking about a campaign of targeted assassinations, really, rather than battles, and they are carried out with no concern for civilians,” Kaldor said.View image in fullscreenPalestinians at a food distribution point run by a charity in Gaza City in July.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe ratio of civilians among the dead in Gaza was more comparable to recent wars in Sudan, Yemen, Uganda and Syria, where much of the violence had been directed against civilians, she said. “These are wars where the armed groups tend to avoid battle. They don’t want to fight each other, they want to control territory and they do that by killing civilians,.“Maybe that is the same with Israel, and this is a model of war [in Gaza] that is about dominating a population and controlling land. Maybe the objective always was forced displacement.”Israel’s government says the war is one of self-defence after the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 people.But political and military leaders regularly use genocidal rhetoric. The general who led military intelligence when the war began has said 50 Palestinians must die for every person killed that day, adding that “it does not matter now if they are children”. Aharon Haliva, who stepped down in April 2024, said mass killing in Gaza was “necessary” as a “message to future generations” of Palestinians, in recordings broadcast on Israeli TV this month.View image in fullscreenA man clasps the body of two-year-old Mila, who was killed with her baby brother, Mohammed, in an Israeli attack on the Nuseirat refugee camp in Deir al-Balah in August last year.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesMany Israeli soldiers have testified that all Palestinians are treated as targets in Gaza. One stationed in Rafah this year said his unit had created an “imaginary line” in the sand and fired at anyone who crossed it, including twice at children and once at a woman. They shot to kill, not to warn, he said. “Nobody aimed for their legs”.Neta Crawford, a professor of international relations at Oxford University and co-founder of theCosts of Warproject, said Israeli tactics marked a “worrisome” abandonment of decades of practices developed to protect civilians.In the 1970s public revulsion about American massacres in Vietnam forced western militaries to shift how they fought. New policies were imperfectly implemented but reflected a focus on limiting harm to civilians that no longer appeared to be part of Israel’s military calculus, she said.“They say they’re using the same kinds of procedures for civilian casualty estimation and mitigation as states like the United States. But if you look at these casualty rates, and their practices with the bombing and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, it is clear that they are not.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

France, Britain and Estonia have indicated they could send troops to a postwar Ukraine, while several other nations said they might take part, though much depends on US involvement.Lavrov’s comments cast doubt on the prospects for peace talks.On Thursday night, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried an aerial assault that included a major US electronics manufacturer among the targets, noting its significance amid US-brokered efforts to end the war.In a post on X, Zelenskyy wrote that “the Russians practically burned down an American company producing electronics – home appliances, nothing military.“The Russians knew exactly where they lobbed the missiles. We believe this was a deliberate attack against American property and investments in Ukraine,” he said, adding: “Telling attack, right as the world awaits a clear answer from Russia on negotiations to end the war.“This war must be brought to an end. Pressure must be exerted on Russia to end the war. Putin understands nothing but force and pressure,” Zelenskyy said.The Ukrainian military said Moscow had fired 574 drones and 40 missiles on Thursday that struck western regions, killing at least one person and injuring 15.Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine., said that 600 night shift workers were on the premises at the time of the strike on the US factory, and six were injured. “The message is clear: Russia is not looking for peace. Russia is attacking American business in Ukraine, humiliating American business.”Russia’s defence ministry said the strikes targeted “enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex,” including drone factories, storage depots, missile launch sites and areas where Ukrainian troops were gathered. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilian areas of Ukraine.In the western city of Lviv, one person was killed and three were injured as the attack damaged 26 residential buildings, a kindergarten and administrative buildings, regional head Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on Telegram. The regional prosecutor’s office said three Russian cruise missiles with cluster munitions struck the city.Ukraine, for its part, has stepped up drone attacks on Russian infrastructure supporting the war, with strikes on oil refineries pushing wholesale gasoline prices in Russia to record highs.After the recent Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, US officials said the Russian president had accepted the prospect of western security guarantees for Ukraine.But the latest statements suggest Moscow may be backing away from that understanding – or that Washington may have misinterpreted the Kremlin’s position from the outset.Trump on Thursday appeared to vent his frustration at Russia’s obstruction. In a post on Truth Social, the US president blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for not allowing Ukraine to “fight back” against Russia.“It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invaders country. It’s like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia. Crooked and grossly incompetent Joe Biden would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK, only DEFEND. How did that work out? … Interesting times ahead!!!” Trump wrote.Trump’s veiled threats against Russia will be welcomed in Kyiv and European capitals, though the US leader has previously backed away from imposing sanctions or boosting support for Ukraine.Lavrov also poured cold water on the prospect of a summit between the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which has been touted by Trump. Lavrov said a bilateral meeting at the highest level would be possible only “if all issues requiring discussion are thoroughly prepared”.He suggested that Putin would meet Zelenskyy only to accept Russia’s maximalist conditions, which would entail Ukraine’s capitulation.Russia’s veteran foreign minister further questioned whether Zelenskyy had the legitimacy to sign any future peace accord, parroting a familiar Kremlin line that portrays Ukraine’s leadership as illegitimate.Despite a flurry of diplomacy in recent days between Trump and his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts, the path to peace remains uncertain as Moscow has shown little willingness to climb down from its maximalist demands.Ukraine mapEven so, the White House on Wednesday continued to strike a positive tone.“President Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukrainian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war,” a White House spokesperson told Fox News.Speaking to foreign correspondents in Kyiv, Zelenskyy, who has agreed to meet Putin, said he would like a “strong reaction” from Washington if the Russian leader was not willing to sit down for a bilateral meeting with him soon.“I responded immediately to the proposal for a bilateral meeting: we are ready. But what if the Russians are not ready?” Zelenskyy said in comments released on Thursday from a briefing with reporters in Kyiv a day earlier.As uncertainty over peace talks persisted, Russia launched one of its heaviest bombardments in weeks.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyEuropeTrump administrationUS politicsShareReuse this content"

Others are labelled as snacks for babies, which goes against government recommendations that children aged six to 12 months do not need snacks between meals, only milk.It comes after researchers found that leading brands, such as Ella’s Kitchen and Heinz, weremaking sugar-heavy, nutritionally poor baby foodthat failed to meet the needs of infants.A report by the University of Leeds school of food science and nutrition,published in April, found that some brands also carried misleading marketing claims, and urged the government to impose the same traffic light system found on chocolate bars and ice-cream.The report’s authors said the new voluntary guidelines were disappointing and would have limited impact. Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the Leeds study, said: “They’re quite narrow in scope, only looking at sugar and salt. But salt is not a major concern in UK baby food.”She raised particular concern that the voluntary guidelines did not address the poor nutritional value of many purees and pouches, which were targeted at weaning babies. The NHSadvises parents to start weaning when a child is about six months old, with vegetables that are not sweet, such as broccoli, cauliflower and spinach.“These products are often too watery. Children need really energy-dense food, rich nutrient-dense food with lots of different fibres and different sources of iron and zinc,” she said. “But these purees, particularly those targeted as first weaning foods, are really low in energy. They are bad substitutions, especially if you’re displacing a nutritious milk feed.”High levels of sugar in children’s diets is a significant factor contributing to high rates of childhood obesity in the UK, which is among the highest in western Europe. At the start of primary school,more than 22% of children in England are obese or overweight, according to the latest official statistics.The public health minister, Ashley Dalton, said the guidelines would help parents who were often“bombarded with confusing labels, disguising unhealthy foods packed with hidden sugars and salt”.Prof Simon Kenny,NHSEngland’s national clinical director for children and young people, said: “These new guidelines alongside clearer labelling will help empower busy parents to make nutritious choices that give their children the best possible start in life.”Last year a House of Lords report found commercial infant foods “are routinely high in sugar and marketed misleadingly”. It called on the government to introducemandatory legal standards for commercial infant foods, without input from manufacturers.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said it expected manufacturers to meet the labelling guidelines within 18 months, adding: “If businesses fail to act, we will consider tougher measures.”Another study found legislation in England to restrict supermarket sales of foods high in fat, sugar or salt had led to millions fewer products being bought.Researchers at the University of Leeds estimated that 2m fewer such products were sold per day after the law took effect in 2022. The number of items high in fat, sugar or salt sold in Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Asda dropped from 20 out of every 100 before the legislation to 19 out of every 100 afterwards.Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthNutritionHealth policyFood & drink industryNHSEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

But her ADHD meant she was forgetful and often lost her phone and keys.She was recruited by the company Gitpod as a vice-president of engineering on a salary of £220,000 with £78,000 bonus per annum.Shortly after arriving, Burns asked Gitpod for a coach to help her with ADHD as she was feeling “deeply overwhelmed” at her workload but was not referred to occupational therapy, the tribunal heard.She attended a Gitpod off-site team building event in Austria and on the final night, was said to be “slurring her words” after drinking alcohol, the tribunal heard.Burns went back to her room and found it was locked and she had no key. There was no receptionist on duty and her roommate had fallen asleep and was not answering her phone.Eventually Burns gave up and went to sleep in the sauna. She later received a message from a senior executive saying she had to stay in control and was given a deadline for improvement but was dismissed two months after the sauna incident.The tribunal said her employer should have done more to investigate and assess her ADHD. On the reasons for her spending the night in the sauna, the tribunal concluded: “This was likely in part to be as a result of the combination of her alcohol consumption and her forgetfulness, which is a something arising from her ADHD.”A hearing will be set to decide on the amount of compensation Burns will receive.Explore more on these topicsUK newsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderEmployment tribunalsBirminghamnewsShareReuse this content"

But union leaders have claimed management have refused to engage seriously.“Our members are doing a fantastic job to keep our capital moving and work strenuous shift patterns to make sure Londoners get to their destinations around the clock,” said the RMT’s general secretary, Eddie Dempsey.“They are not after a king’s ransom, but fatigue and extreme shift rotations are serious issues impacting on our members’ health and wellbeing – all of which have not been adequately addressed for years by LU management.“Coupled with the fact there are outstanding issues around staff travel arrangements, an atmosphere of distrust has been created, where our members feel like no one is listening to them.“RMT will continue to engage LU management with a view to seeking a revised offer in order to reach a negotiated settlement.”Docklands Light Railway workers have also been in discussions about pay and conditions.A Transport for London spokesperson said: “We regularly meet with our trade unions to discuss any concerns that they may have, and we recently met with the RMT to discuss some specific points.“We are committed to ensuring our colleagues are treated fairly and, as well as offering a 3.4% pay increase in our ongoing pay discussions, we have made progress on a number of commitments we have made previously.“We welcome further engagement with our unions about fatigue and rostering across London Underground, but a reduction in the contractual 35-hour working week is neither practical nor affordable.“Given the improvements we have recently put in place in response to concerns raised by our unions, we urge the RMT to put our fair, affordable pay offer to their members and to continue to engage with us rather than threaten strike action, which will only disrupt Londoners.”Explore more on these topicsLondon UndergroundIndustrial actionLondonRMTRail transportTransportEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

She had also turned off a device designed to automatically deploy a parachute at a certain speed or altitude should a skydiver be unable to do so. The parachute and device were found to be in full working order.The inquest heard that Damarell normally wore a camera to capture her dives, but was not wearing one on the day she died.Hamilton concluded that Damarell, a “very experienced” skydiver, had intended to end her own life.The inquest heard that DI Andrew Stephenson of Durham police, who attended the scene, found that Damarell had left instructions on her phone’s lock screen about how to access it after her death. His report said that notes addressed to her family were found on the handset, which included her “apologising and thanking them for their support”, as well as details of her finances.Speaking after the inquest, Damarell’s family accepted the coroner’s findings and thanked the skydiving community for its support, saying they were “incredibly comforted by how admired, respected and deeply loved she was”.Describing her as “brilliant, beautiful, brave and truly extraordinary”, they said they wanted to speak “openly and without shame” about her death to “contribute to a culture where mental ill-health is met with kindness and support, and where people in deep distress, and those around them, feel seen, believed and able to reach for support without fear of judgment”.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The organisations that were polled support tens of thousands of asylum seekers, refugees and other migrants.The threats have emerged asKeir Starmerfaces a growing clamour from councils to block hotels being used to house asylum seekers through legal action, after a court ruled that more than 100 applicants staying in Essex should be moved.Data released on Thursday showed the number of asylum seekers being housed in hotelshad risen by 8% to 32,059in a year. Despite many people coming from countries known for serious human rights abuses and conflict, rates of asylum being granted to people coming from such countries as Afghanistan, Iran and Eritrea, for example, remain low compared with recent years.The safety concerns set out in the report are so grave that an internal Home Office meeting is due to take place imminently to discuss growing concerns about similar problems.The organisations have been forced to take radical steps to protect themselves and their clients in recent months, including temporarily closing their physical offices and moving to an online-only service and removing content from their websites including location information.Coordination with police and other authorities has increased and in some cases officers have installed new CCTV close to refugee organisations so that any attacks or incidents of harassment can be captured on camera.During the course of the research, multiple organisations reported online threats, trolling, hostile emails and intimidating Facebook posts. Some anti-migrant protesters made video recordings of refugee organisation premises and shared them in far-right online groups, with one NGO named on a far-right hitlist having to close temporarily, while some received harassing phone calls and threatening messages.One NGO that took part in the survey said: “We have had to create a safe room where all of us could be contained in the event of an attack while the police arrived.”“The hostile environment has to be dismantled,” said another. A third added: “There is concern that the government is parroting far-right lines instead of adopting their own anti-racist stance. This is extremely disappointing.”The briefing has emerged at a time when the refugee sector is under unprecedented strain. Those working in the field say they have never known things to be so bad and many are now refusing to be quoted publicly for fear of attracting more attacks.The Charity Commission has taken the highly unusual step of removing the names of trustees from several charities listed on its website. It did so after the Home Office gave a far-right influencer the names of some organisations with which it had had meetings about asylum accommodation, following a freedom of information request.While a spokesperson said it was not possible to comment on individual cases, removing trustee names is highly unusual. According to Charity Commission guidance, it happens only if the commission grants a dispensation: “We can grant a dispensation if displaying an individual’s name could put the relevant person or people in personal physical or mental danger. Dispensations will not be granted automatically.”One example of the recent hostility targeted at organisations is provided by City of Sanctuary UK, which was falsely accused of grooming schoolchildren for the benefit of adult male asylum seekers. Schools supportive of the organisation carried out an annual arts activity where children make cards to send to refugees around Valentine’s Day with the message: “showing your heart for refugees”.The event was part of a broader refugees welcome campaign that is symbolised by orange hearts. The children did not sign their names on their cards and the anonymous messages were then passed on to refugees the children will never meet as a generic message of welcome.The former Conservative education secretary Gavin Williamson has made a complaint to the Charity Commission about the activity, claiming that it is politicised. Far-right activists have accused City of Sanctuary of grooming children for the benefit of adult male asylum seekers.Far-right anger over asylum hotels is destroying the very idea of refuge – and that’s probably the goal | Zoe WilliamsRead moreA spokesperson for City of Sanctuary UK said: “Our work has been deliberately misrepresented by a dangerous campaign built on false and inflammatory claims. These attacks not only put our staff and the school communities we support at risk, but are part of a wider strategy: to sow division and fuel hostility towards people seeking sanctuary. This is not just an attack on us – it is an attack on the values of compassion, safety and solidarity.”A Charity Commission spokesperson said: “Concerns have been raised with us about alleged political activity linked to City of Sanctuary. We are currently assessing the information available to determine if there is a regulatory role for us.”On Thursday, a series of St George’s crosses were painted on pedestrian crossings near a Canary Wharf hotel, where asylum seekers are planned to be housed.View image in fullscreenThe St George’s crosses drawn on the pedestrian crossing in Canary Wharf.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAThe latest Home Office figures, published on Thursday as part of the usual quarterly immigration statistics, cover Labour’s first year in office.There were 32,059 asylum seekers in UK hotels by the end of June, up from 29,585 at the same point a year earlier, when the Conservatives were still in power, but down slightly on the 32,345 figure at the end of March.For the first time in four years, the asylum applications backlog has fallen below 100,000 people. It is now just above 70,000 cases, relating to almost 91,000 people – down by 18% from a year earlier and its lowest since September 2021.Epping Forest district council in Essex, which was granted an interim injunctionblocking the use of the Bell hotel as asylum accommodation, went from housing 28 asylum seekers in hotels in its area in March this year, to 199 by the end of June.A Home Office spokesperson said: “We strongly condemn any form of harassment or intimidation. Anyone who engages in such behaviour can expect to face the full force of the law.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumRefugeesFar rightKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

We are beyond excited to embark on this beautiful next chapter of parenthood in both peace and privacy.”The post, which was accompanied by the Beatles song Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, continued: “And then there were 3.”Brown, best known for her role as Eleven in the Netflix dramaStranger Things, and Bongiovi, a model who is the son of the musician Jon Bon Jovi, married last October after their engagement in 2023.Alongside photos from their wedding last year, Bongiovi wrote in a post at the time: “Forever and always, your husband.”Brown has previously spoken about wanting to become a parent, adding that she wanted a large family with her husband. She mentioned the possibility of adopting.Speaking in March on the SmartLess podcast, hosted by Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett, the actor said: “Jake knows how important it is to me [to have a child].”Brown, who recently appeared alongside Chris Pratt in sci-fi film The Electric State, added: “Of course, I want to focus on really establishing myself as an actor and as a producer, but I also find it’s so important to start a family, for me, personally.”In 2023, the publication of Brown’s debut novel reignited a debate over ghostwritten celebrity books.Nineteen Steps, inspired by her grandmother’s experience of the 1943 Bethnal Green tube disaster, was ghostwritten by author Kathleen McGurlyet the cover of the book featured only Brown’s name.In response to a subsequently deleted tweet by Waterstones promoting the book, many X users had criticised the star.Brown had posted an image on Instagram of herself holding the book standing next to McGurl, with the caption: “I couldn’t have done this without you!”Zoella (the media personality Zoë Sugg), Katie Price and Naomi Campbell are among celebrities who have also used ghostwriters for their fiction books.Explore more on these topicsMillie Bobby BrownStranger ThingsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

The variations are fractional compared with what came before.GCSE results: pupils in England bounce back from pandemic as top grades riseRead moreAs the tide of disruption recedes, however, it exposes the broken legacy of a policy introduced by Michael Gove more than a decade ago, of forcing students who fail to achieve at least a grade 4 in GCSE maths and English to resit the qualifications while they remain in education.Until 2019 the policy, along with reforms to GCSE formats and grading, led to fewer resits being required, especially among disadvantaged pupils. That has now reversed, and the number forced into retakes has gone up. There were 346,000 entries in English and mathsGCSEsby students aged 17 to 19 this year, compared with fewer than 300,000 in 2024.Just one in six for the older age group passed maths this year, and only one in 100 got top grades. Among the 19-year-olds disappointed this year will be some who sat GCSE maths for the third time after failing to achieve a grade 4 “standard pass” in 2023 or 2024, leading educators and experts to become increasingly critical of the resit policy.Jill Duffy, the chair of the Joint Council for Qualifications and chief executive of the OCR examination board, said nearly a quarter of GCSE maths and English entries were now resits, an all-time high.“This is a resit crisis. Tinkering at the edges of policy won’t fix this,” she said.Prof Ulrike Tillmann, the chair of the Royal Society’s education committee, said: “History shows that two-thirds of GCSE resit students do not achieve the required grade by age 19, and we cannot let this pattern continue.Primary Sats ‘working well’ but Gove’s Ebacc needs scrutiny, review chief saysRead more“Repeated resits create huge pressures on teachers, schools and colleges, not to mention the emotional strain on students forced to retake an exam that does not serve them. We must question whether the maths content these students are studying meets their needs.”Duffy agreed that a closer look at maths and English was needed across the secondary curriculum. “When we’ve looked at scripts for those students who aren’t getting grade 4, what’s really clear is that there are fundamental skills they should have been getting much earlier in key stage 3, if not earlier,” she said.She envisions changes to the two subjects, to reduce “overcrowding” in maths by stripping out topics such as trigonometry and to make the English qualification more relevant.“When we look at GCSE English, I would say it is universally unpopular. I haven’t met a student or teacher who likes it,” she said. “We really need to look at that and we need to add more modern relevant texts so we’re making it more relevant and more engaging for young people today.”Change may be on the way. The government has commissioned anational curriculum reviewfor England, which is expected to report later this year. One of the key points among itsinterim findingswill be “considering the impact of current performance measures on young people’s choices and outcomes” – a hint that the built-in cycle of failure may be ending.Explore more on these topicsGCSEsMathematicsExamsSecondary schoolsEducation policyCollegesSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

Akram said: ‘This all stems from one thing, which is hate.’Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianNorthern Ireland‘Everyone is scared’: vigilantes ignite race hate fears on streets of BelfastImmigrants, refugees and people of colour face campaign of intimidation in loyalist east part of cityRory CarrollIreland correspondentThu 21 Aug 2025 11.43 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareEach evening after sunset the vigilantes gather near CS Lewis Square to rove the streets with a sense of swagger and a grandiose title: Belfast Nightwatch First Division.The group, typically numbering a dozen members, seeks out dark-skinned males and challenges them to produce identity documents and explanations for their presence in the east of the city.“Hey boy, I don’t want to catch you around our parks any more,” one member recently told a black man sitting on a riverside bench.Unsatisfactory responses elicit warnings to leave Belfast or face consequences. Some interrogations are filmed and uploaded to social media, often with a rap or rock music soundtrack, and greeted with praise by followers.It is the latest front in a campaign of intimidation against immigrants, refugees and people of colour that has driven families from homes and prompted many to consider leavingNorthern Ireland.“It’s worse than ever now. Everyone is scared,” said Mohammed Idris, 51, a Sudanese refugee who lost his shop to a riot last year. “You don’t know exactly what will happen the next day. I don’t think I see a future here.”Another shopkeeper, who gave his name only as Mo, said racist abuse had become normalised. “A few days ago a guy came up to me and said: ‘Get the fuck back to your country.’ He insulted everyone on the street and slapped a guy.”Anti-immigrant riots in England last Augustinspiredcopycat eruptions in Belfastand further emboldened a campaign of thuggery that has spread across Northern Ireland in recent years.Families from Africa – many employed in healthcare – have hadwindows smashedand cars burned in towns across County Antrim. In June mobstargeted the homes of Roma people in Ballymena,forcing hundreds to flee. This week youths in the Donegall Pass area of south Belfast threw bottles, cans and water balloons at members of ethnic minorities and other targets.The most high-profile threat, for now, is in the loyalist, Protestant part of east Belfast where vigilantes rove the Newtownards Road and nearby areas to confront foreign-looking men. Or, as their Facebook page puts it: “Concerned parents … working together, patrolling Belfast streets, for the safety and protection of our children and vulnerable people.”It is an Orwellian claim. Almost half of those who were arrested for race hate disorder in Belfast last summerhad previously been reported to police for domestic abuse.Misinformation driven by social media depicts immigrants as predators who lurk around playgrounds, surveil women and creep around estates trying door handles.“You try to build trust in the community but you find that after years you’re still a stranger,” said Idris. He has opened a new shop to replace the destroyed one but is considering leaving Northern Ireland.So are Mohammed, Sherif and Adel, software engineers from Egypt who moved to Belfast with their wives and children several years ago to work in the city’s booming tech sector. Intimidation has become more brazen and frequent, they said.Since April the three men have experienced the same phenomenon: a small group of people approach them in a public space, usually a street or park, and film and follow them. If the engineers retreat to their cars the pursuers – sometimes shouting insults, sometimes silent – film and photograph their numberplates.“Each time we report it to the police because maybe these people will make up stories about us and say we were doing something wrong,” said Sherif. “We’ve stopped going out after 9pm. We used to feel that Northern Ireland was home but these days, no longer. Feeling safe is the most important thing. If you don’t feel safe, you don’t stay.” All three said they planned to return to Egypt.Kashif Akram, a board member of the Belfast Islamic Centre, which wasattacked in June, said immigrants were being scapegoated for economic and social problems. “This all stems from one thing, which is hate.”Akram said politicians who condemn race attacks while citing housing shortages were sending mixed signals. “The two issues are separate.”He hopes arace and ethnicity action planlaunched by the police will help to punish and deter aggression. Police monitor the vigilantes andofficers arrested a 37-year-oldon suspicion of assault, theft and causing criminal damage. A vigil by his supporters was addressed by a self-styled citizen journalist with armed robbery convictions, the Belfast Telegraph reported.The vigilantes have divided opinion in east Belfast.Some residents expressed shame. “It’s horrendous. Pure racism,” said a 34-year-old woman who withheld her name. “That these guys are claiming to protect women is beyond ironic.”View image in fullscreenSidharth Sreekumar, a civil servant from England, near his home in east Belfast.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianThe owner of a shop that sells loyalist bunting, in contrast, endorsed the nocturnal patrols. “They’re not vigilantes, they’re protectors of the community. They’re trying to keep people safe. One of them has a walking frame – how can he be a vigilante?”Rosemary Jenkinson, a writer who lives in the area, said foreigners were still settling in east Belfast and noted that last month dozens of immigrants attended a loyalist bonfire that celebrated Protestant culture. “It’s a positive sign.”Sidharth Sreekumar, a 32-year-old civil servant of Indian heritage, said he enjoys living in east Belfast, though he acknowledged he had two advantages. “I’m English and I’m 6ft 3in. I think people would think twice about messing with me.”Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandRaceImmigration and asylumPoliceThe far rightMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Tired of waxing, bored by shaving and fed up with ingrown hairs? In the past few years, a quiet revolution has taken place in the hair removal market, promising to banish stubbly regrowth and take away the pain of waxing and epilation. I’m speaking of the growing number of IPL (intense pulsed light) devices suitable for home use.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Put simply, IPL uses pulses of light to make the hair go into its resting phase (stop growing) and fall out. IPL isn’t a permanent hair-removal solution like electrolysis, but you should see a significant reduction in hair regrowth over time. With the right device, it’s also simple to do at home, fairly quick and almost completely painless.I tried 10 of the best at-home IPL devices at a range of price points to see which left me feeling soft and smooth without stress or mess.At a glanceBest IPL device overall for face and body:Philips Lumea 9900£449.99 at John LewisBest budget IPL device:No!No!

I’ve also been removing hair from parts of my body using other methods for well over 30 years, and I’m always looking for ways to make the process simpler, quicker and less painful.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach IPL device was tested for three full sessions.Photograph: Lise Smith/The GuardianI tested 10 IPL machines, including corded and cordless models. To test, I used each device as directed for three full sessions, focusing on the same place every time and keeping a record of how long it took to treat each area, how the treated area felt afterwards, and how much regrowth was visible after the first, second and third sessions. In my commitment to thoroughness (and almost total disregard for the conventions of summer dressing), I also left a “control” area untreated, to compare regrowth against.I checked the weight and dimensions of each device and noted how easy each felt to hold and manoeuvre in normal use. I also used a stopwatch to time the flash rate. Finally, I noted the total number of flashes each device can produce – an indication of the product lifetime.Any devices not returned to the manufacturer after testing were donated for resale to the homelessness charityCrisis.Here are the seven best IPL devices from my tests.The best IPL and laser hair removal devicesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lise Smith/The GuardianBest IPL device overall for face and body:Philips Lumea 9900View image in fullscreen£449.99 at John Lewis£436.49 at AmazonPhilips has been in the IPL game for years – the first Lumea model was launched in 2010, and this version came out last year. The Lumea 9900 is particularly versatile, with five power levels and four attachments for use on the face, underarms and body.Why we love itThe neatest aspect of the Lumea 9900 is the four smart attachments that trigger a suitable light intensity for the selected treatment area when fitted: the body attachment covers larger patches quickly, while the facial attachment triggers a more gentle intensity suitable for sensitive skin. I testeda more expensive version of the 9900(model BRP958) that comes with a separate mini facial hair remover (handy for treating peach fuzz), but the version linked above also treats facial hair and sensitive areas effectively thanks to the smart attachments that go on the main unit.The Lumea 9900 can be used with mains power or cordless; I found using it in cordless mode made it easy to reach areas such as under the arms, although the flash rate is faster when plugged into the mains. An optional app helps with recommended settings for your skin tone and treatment area, and a handy treatment schedule tracker.If you’re primarily looking for a leg treatment, there are cheaper devices here that are also easier to hold – the Lumea’s design is a bit top-heavy and can feel awkward. But if you want to use it on your face and multiple body parts, it’s the most versatile device on our list. I had good results within a few weeks, with less hair growing back than usual.It’s a shame that …with a flash rate of about two seconds a flash, it takes more time to move the device over a treatment area, so it’s comparatively slow. It takes about 10 minutes to do a half leg with the Lumea, compared with five with faster devices.Suitable for dark skin/light hair?NoFlash rate (timed):two seconds a flash when plugged into mains (slower when cordless)Lifetime number of flashes:450,000Power levels:fiveNumber of attachment heads:fourBest budget IPL device:No!No! PlusView image in fullscreen£160 at Argos£160 at AmazonThe No!No! Plus IPL hair remover is an ultra-simple device for anyone unsure about the steep cost of premium options. It’s budget-friendly and does the basics with absolutely zero bells and whistles.Why we love itRetailing at £160, the Plus has five intensity levels and attachments for face, body and bikini areas. In three test sessions on my leg, I saw some thinning of the hair and reduced regrowth, although not to the same extent as the more powerful models in our list.While the device is easy to use, it emits an alarmingly bright flash – there’s a reason a pair of dark glasses is included. It also feels somewhat slight and plasticky in comparison with the sturdy builds of the other devices. This is very much an entry-level device for the IPL-curious; if you don’t fancy spending a ton on hair removal, this could be the one for you.It’s a shame that …hair regrowth is not reduced by as much as with pricier models; it’s definitely built for value rather than quality.Suitable for dark skin/light hair?NoFlash rate (timed):two seconds per flashLifetimenumber of flashes:300,000Power settings:fiveNumber of attachment heads:two, plus one built inBest for ease of use:Bondi Body v2laser @homeView image in fullscreen£299 at Bondi BodyAnother good choice for IPL and laser newcomers, the Bondi Body’s biggest attractions are its neat size and foolproof ease of use.Why we love itThe V2 IPL device (note that despite the name, it’s an IPL, not a laser) is among the more compact models in our test. Barely bigger than a typical electric shaver or epilator, the contoured oval unit fits nicely in the palm of the hand and is easy to grasp and manoeuvre. The V2 doesn’t come with extra heads or attachments, but that makes it simple and intuitive to use – just press the flash button and go.There are eight intensity settings, so the V2 can be used on both sensitive areas and coarser hair – I found level six quite comfortable to use on my leg. Bondi Body recommends use up to twice a week on legs and arms, and I found regrowth on my test leg noticeably reduced over the testing period. It’s also compact enough to join you on your travels.It’s a shame that …the V2 is limited in which skin and hair colours it can be used with – like many IPL devices (but not all; see the Silk’n below). The three-second flash time is on the slower side, so treating a full area takes longer.Suitable for dark skin/light hair?NoFlash rate (timed):three seconds per flashLifetime number of flashes:400,000Power levels:eightNumber of attachment heads:no additional attachmentsBest for all skin and hair types:Silk’n 7View image in fullscreen£399.20 at Cult Beauty£399.20 at DebenhamsMany of the IPL devices in our test can be used only on fair to medium skin tones, and with medium to dark hair colours. The big appeal of the Silk’n 7 is its skin colour sensor, which calibrates the treatment to work on a wider range of skin and hair colours.Why we love itTo test the skin and hair colour detection, I used the Silk’n 7 on my arm hairs, which are a very light blond and not usually suitable for IPL treatment. I also tested an area on my leg to compare with our other models. It took both areas in its stride, and I did notice slower regrowth on my arm and leg over the testing period.The Silk’n 7 has a long, tapered design slightly reminiscent of a Dust Buster – the one I tested came in a rather glam pale gold colour. The device felt comfortable to hold and easy to use; the rotating swivel head makes it easy to reach the more awkward areas of the body, and there are attachments for face, body and underarm areas. I also liked the optional phone app to help keep track of treatments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

This means the treatment schedule is a bit different: rather than every two weeks or so, the recommendation is to use it three times in the first week and weekly thereafter. While this requires a few evenings dedicated to treatments in the first few days, there were noticeably smoother patches on my test leg after just a couple of weeks.Instead of flashing, the device emits a gentle pulse of warm red light; I found there was a bit of a knack to seeing when the light had pulsed so that I could move on to the next area. The fan that cools the device is also one of the loudest in our test, and it’s quite heavy to hold in the hand. However, each individual treatment is fast, so you’re not holding it for too long, and after a few weeks you won’t need to hold it very often.It’s a shame that …it’s expensive compared with other devices on our list, and is heavy to hold – but the fast results speak for themselves.Suitable for dark skin/light hair?NoFlash rate (timed):not applicableLifetime number of flashes:not applicablePower levels:sixNumber of attachment heads:no additional attachmentsThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lise Smith/The GuardianForeo Peach 2View image in fullscreen£258.30 at John Lewis£202.95 at AmazonBest for:comfortSwedish beauty brand Foreo’s cute candy-coloured device is a user-friendly product for anyone nervous about trying IPL. The compact unit has a colourful silicone casing, which is easy to grip and feels soft as it glides over the skin. The large treatment window and fast flash rate of two flashes a second mean you can cover large areas quickly and won’t have to spend long on each treatment. There’s a downloadable app that guides you through the treatment steps, which is handy if you’re new to IPL – although the device can be used without.It didn’t make the final cut because …while I definitely saw a reduction in regrowth after three sessions, there wasn’t as much as with other devices: Foreo recommends 12 weeks’ use for best results. The app is useful (and free) but pushes you to spend more on subscription plans and upgrades.Suitable for dark skin/light hair?No;flash rate (timed):two flashes a second;lifetimenumber of flashes:500,000;power settings:five;number of attachment heads:no additional attachmentsBraun Silk Expert pro 5View image in fullscreen£409.99 at Braun£409.99 at AmazonBest for:an all-rounderThe Braun Silk Expert Pro 5 IPL is a powerful all-in-one device. The big draw here is Braun’s SensoAdapt technology, which continuously adjusts the light intensity to skin tone so that it’s always using the most effective level for fast results. You can also manually select from three power levels, and there are two attachment heads: standard for body, and precision for face and intimate areas. Results after three sessions were very good, and Braun promises up to 95% reduction in hair growth with weekly use in the first four to 12 weeks.It didn’t make the final cut because …I slightly preferred the Lumea 9900 for ease of use, although this is a sleek and powerful device. The Silk Expert Pro 5 is less effective on light hair or dark skin – so you might also prefer the Silk’n 7 at this price point.Suitable for dark skin/light hair?No;flash rate (timed):two flashes per second;lifetimenumber of flashes:400,000;power settings:three;number of attachment heads:twoWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lise Smith/The GuardianWhat is IPL?IPL stands for intense pulsed light – a system that uses pulses of light to heat up the hair follicles and cause the hair to go into its telogen or “resting” phase. This makes the hair shed (or fall out) and grow back more slowly and finer. Laser treatment used in salons also heats up the hair follicles to reduce regrowth, but the light used in IPL treatments is broad-spectrum and safe for use at home.Although IPL isn’t a permanent hair removal treatment, it will significantly reduce hair growth over time. IPL can also be used as a skin treatment to reduce hyperpigmentation, broken veins and acne rosacea.How do I use my home IPL (or laser) device?As an IPL newbie, I was surprised to find that the first step is to remove hair from the target area – this is so that the pulsed light reaches the hair follicle directly rather than burning surface hairs, which can cause discomfort. Use your IPL on dry skin, and avoid using body lotions before a treatment.If you’re using IPL for the first time, start with a test area to check for discomfort before you do the whole body. Select your power level and use the “flash” button to emit a pulse of light, then move on to the next area and repeat. Some devices have a useful “glide” mode, where holding down the flash button releases pulses continuously as you move it over the body. An IPL device with a faster flash rate will, obviously, cover your chosen treatment area more quickly.Can anyone use IPL?The treatment works best on light skin with dark hair; very light blond or grey hair may not respond well, and darker skin tones may be at risk of burns. Always check the manufacturer’s guidelines to ensure your skin and hair type are compatible. IPL is also not suitable for male facial hair due to the thickness of beard hair.Avoid using IPL on sore or broken skin or very sensitive areas. If your device is designed for facial hair, follow the instructions carefully and use any special facial attachments included. Never use a body-only device on the face.Are there any drawbacks to using IPL?The main drawback is the upfront cost – IPL devices cost more than you’re probably used to spending on hair removal. However, if you tot up the cost of a monthly salon wax (or even at-home waxing and depilation), you’ll probably find that an IPL device costs the same or less after about a year or so. IPL devices are also less painful than waxing or epilation, cleaner than creams, and reduce ingrown hairs and irritation compared with shaving.How long will my IPL device last?Below each product in this roundup, we’ve detailed the number of flashes each device is expected to produce over its working lifetime, ranging from 300,000 to 600,000 flashes. What that means in practice will depend on the size of the area you want to treat and how often you treat it. You can expect to use about 100-120 flashes each time you treat a half leg (ankle to knee), with most devices recommending a monthly maintenance treatment after the first eight to 12 weeks of use. If you’re using your IPL on your arms and legs once a month, that means your device should last between 20 and 30 years – plenty of use for the price.Can I recycle my IPL device?If you want to upgrade your IPL device before it reaches the end of its natural life, you’ll want to make sure you dispose of your current device sustainably.If your IPL device still works but you no longer need it, check whether the manufacturer offers a refurbishment or resale programme; you may even be able to trade in your old model for a newer device. Resale programmes are also great for buying if you’re on a budget – manufacturer-refurbished IPLs come with the same statutory guarantees as new products, so they’re safe to use and often significantly cheaper.If your IPL device no longer works, it can still be recycled under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive. Some manufacturers and retailers accept devices for recycling at the point of sale, or you can check if your local recycling centre accepts WEEE items. If your local centre can’t take WEEE for any reason,Recycle Your Electricalsshould be able to help.Lise Smith is a beauty and lifestyle journalist who loves getting her hands and hair on the latest in beauty technology.

After unsheathing the blade, she pokes it into her stomach, then makes a slitting motion across her throat. Although these may seem like the ritual actions of a priestess, Saeidi is actually performing on stage at Bristol festival ArcTanGent last weekend, singing with her metal outfit Lowen in a crammed tent.“It’s a Turkish Ottoman dagger,” she tells me backstage later that day. “I got it in some very cool, obscure-looking vintage shop in Turkey last year. I’m really interested in historical items from that region – but, because I can’t go toIran, I have to gather things from around the Silk Road and places like that.”Saeidi is a Briton of Iranian descent, her parents having fled their home country to seek asylum following the 1979 revolution. She was born in exile and does things every day that would break the law in Iran. It is forbidden for women to sing by themselves in public; in 2015, members of thrashmetal band Confesswere arrested for blasphemy and propaganda against the state simply because they made anti-establishment music. In the 1980s, the Iranian government kept Saeidi’s aunt in prison for nine years and tortured her due to her socialist activism, before she too escaped to the UK.“She has horrific PTSD,” the singer says. “She’s basically my second mum. She raised me and she would take me to protests. I kind of got my political acumen from her.”Through Lowen – a twist on the word “lion”, as the band believe the animal symbolises power in eastern and western cultures – Saeidi expresses her passion for Iranian history and her disdain for the country’s authoritarian regime. On last year’s debut album Do Not Go to War With the Demons of Mazandaran (named after a chapter from the epic Persian poem the Shahnameh), she sings in English, Farsi and extinct languages such as Sumerian. She also uses the tahrir vocal technique, a wobbling wail distinct to Iranian classical music.The first line of the song Najang Bah Divhayeh Mazandaran is “Let this be the death of silence”, announcing the band’s defiant intent. The title ofCorruption on Earthcomes from the charge Iran givespolitical prisonersbefore executing them, and its lyrics address the Woman, Life, Freedom movement:nationwide demonstrationsthat followed the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was allegedly tortured for not adhering to Iran’s strict clothing laws for women. From the movement’s beginnings in late 2022 through to September 2023, Iranian authorities killed at least 551 protesters.“I feel guilt for not being there,” Saeidi says when I mention the protests. “I’m in such a privileged position that I can make music here. If I were in Iran, I’d be happy that I’d be with my family, that I’d be able to explore the country, but I would not have the freedoms that I have.”Since releasing the album last October, Lowen’s powerful themes and labyrinthine sound have made them one of the UK’s hottest metal acts.MetalHammer put Do Not Go to War … in its top 10 albums of 2024; the band have toured with former Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde; and this summer, as well as ArcTanGent, they played at Download festival.View image in fullscreenLowen, left to right: Cal Constantine, Nina Saeidi, Shem Lucas.Photograph: Andy FordBut the genre in which Saeidi is a rising star was banned at home when she was young. “My dad was quite tyrannical,” she remembers. “A lot of people assume it’s because of religion, but he just didn’t like noise. If I turned a page too loudly in my book at night, he would come in and scream at me.”Classic rock and Middle Eastern folk were permitted when Saeidi’s father wasn’t around. Eventually, in an act of protest, she picked up an issue of Kerrang! and bought albums by the two bands that stood out most: Armenian American four-piece System of a Down and UK black/death metal provocateurs Akercocke.“Both became my favourite band,” she says. “Akercocke are extremely sexual but kind of empowering, in my opinion, for women. As a teenager growing up in an extremely Middle Eastern household, that was crazy shocking – if someone was kissing on TV, the channel would get changed.”Saeidi met guitarist Shem Lucas at an Akercocke show in London, and they co-founded Lowen in 2017. The band will play their biggest headline concert to date at Camden’s Underworld in December, and they’re in the middle of writing their second album, which will reference Israel’s bombing of Iran in June.View image in fullscreenLowen performing at ArcTanGent festival.Photograph: Carl Battams“Our new music contains samples of those bombings,” Saeidi reveals. “I do not agree with anything that Israel has done. It’s bad to bomb Iran. None of those governments are good – neither is ours. We need to start separating criticism of a government from criticism of a people or an ethnicity or a religion, because it’s not the same thing.”However, Saeidi doesn’t want Lowen’s music to be a call to action, hoping instead to create a communal space for listeners. “People need to spend more time with each other,” she believes, arguing that third spaces – those outside work and home – “are being cut away, and I think that is causing so much division. Through division, people are getting away with murder, essentially – with genocide.”Do Not Go to War With the Demons of Mazandaranis out now on Church Road.

That’s one of the many running jokes in Ethan Coen’s comic sun-blasted noirish caper Honey Don’t!, in which the titular gumshoe even tries to talk a potential client (Billy Eichner, a hoot) out of hiring her. Having Honey expose his cheating partner would just be wasting his money, she insists. Turns out, she’s right.Splitsville review – open marriage comedy is a silly, scrappy and sex-filled good timeRead moreIt’s not that Honey is incapable. She’s got all the right instincts, and can typically sniff out the scoundrels in her midst. Her brow almost always stays furrowed, especially when she’s in a room with men, as if she’s got a resting interrogator face. But she’s rarely committed to the assignment, or just too easily distracted by curious subplots and hot lesbians to get the job done.The same can be said of Honey Don’t! as a whole. The movie is just as liable to amble along on detours or be seduced by something or someone on the margins. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s kind of integral to the whole vibe.This is Ethan Coen’s second outing – after last year’sDrive-Away Dolls– without his brother Joel. The duo is of course responsible for The Big Lebowski and No Country For Old Men, among so many more sinister classics and larks. But lately they have been taking a break, with Coen tagging in his wife Tricia Cooke as co-writer, and co-conspirator.Cooke, by the way, identifies as a lesbian. She and Coen have a special arrangement as far as their marriage goes, and a very distinct sensibility when it comes to their two trashy queered-up takes on B-movie genre fare (with a third potentially on the way to round out a loose trilogy). Both Drive-Away Dolls and Honey, Don’t! can feel like they’re cruising, leisurely if not mischievously, mostly taking in the scenery populated with deliciously kooky characters, who run into or away from each other while bodies pile up in spurts of hilariously nasty violence, without necessarily adding up to much.Gone is the remarkable tension we get in Coen Brothers movies that lived between its meticulous artistry and low-brow humour, which usually ended up serving each other beautifully. There are times when these Coen-Cooke collaborations whiff in that direction. But the fascinating and frustrating tension that sticks can be found in the intention when it comes to storytelling choices and the slackness in which it all unfolds.But about that scenery. It tends to be loaded. Drive-Away Dolls (its original title, Drive-Away Dykes, didn’t make it across the finish line) was about two women from Philly (played by Qualley and Geraldine Viswanathan) on a pre-Y2K road trip to Florida, the red state’s politics only faintly intruding on their sexual misadventures.In Honey Don’t!, which is not a period piece, Coen and Cooke head to Bakersfield, a Republican nook in California. In the opening credits, the film-makers’ names – along with their collaborators – are painted into the setting, appearing on vintage signage in the town’s rundown auto shops and dives, as if they’re taking up residence in this unattended wasteland. While so much about Honey Don’t! feels like amusing digressions, the locale, in a movie where a vulnerable population is preyed on by a crooked evangelical reverend, is undeniably a choice.Chris Evans plays the Reverend, Drew Devlin, the actor laying the smarm on thick as he puts up a futile fight against his boy scout charm and dreamy grin. His reverend is a shameless narcissist who works dungeon sex into his preaching about pathways to the lord, while also using his church as front for his side hustle as Bakersfield’s drug kingpin.Qualley’s Honey stumbles into Drew’s orbit when she’s snooping around after a troubled would-be client who happened to be a member of his congregation is killed in a suspicious car accident. He naturally brings out the dickish-ness in her private dick. Actually most men do, whether they’re slimy, hopeless or refusing to accept that her being a lesbian is a real thing while they keep plying her with advances.On the flipside, Honey lets her shoulders down around women, especially those that set off her gaydar, like Aubrey Plaza’s cop MG, who she wastes no time bedding, and Lera Abova’s alluring femme fatale (so femme she actually might be French!) who moseys around town on a Vespa.These characters and more don’t so much connect (to each other or some overarching plot) as they brush past each other. But Honey’s time with them makes it all worthwhile, because Qualley is such a commanding force. She slinks into every scene, all husky-voiced and quippy, her character often calling out the tropes in everyone and everything while only flirting with becoming one herself.It’s hard to stay mad at a movie for refusing to add things up, or resolve its mysteries in any traditionally satisfying ways, when getting lost with Qualley can be such a pleasure. Besides, following narrative threads through to the finish is just playing it too straight for this movie; what with it’s delightful disdain for anything that might even remotely be associated with hetero.Honey Don’t! is out in US cinemas 22 August, Australia on 28 August and in the UK on 5 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsMargaret QualleyCoen brothersAubrey PlazaChris EvansComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve been asked about the “tinnification” of drinks pretty much everywhere else, so it feels only apt to talk about it here, too, because producers are putting just about everything they can in a can these days. Obviously, canned drinks aren’t anything new – the first canned beer went on sale in 1935, when post-prohibition America saw Krueger’s Finest Beer punted to drinkers in Virginia. Similar attempts had been made many years earlier, but it wasn’t until after two years of testing that the boffins finally developed a special coating that prevented the beer from reacting with the tin can.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And it’s not just beer that’s getting the aluminium treatment. Canned cocktails and canned wine are now going from strength to strength, too (and irrespective of whether you view the latter as a marvel of modern science or a vinous abomination) . Time was when only Provençal rosé and New Zealand sauvignon blanc got the tinned treatment, but now everything fromorange winetoEnglish sparklingis getting tinnified.The reasons for this are many, and all are inescapably tied to modern drinking habits. The Silicon Valley Bank’s 2025 state of the US wine industryreportrecorded a rise of29.3%in the uptake of so-called ready-to-drink (RTD) products, citing convenience and cost as two of the main factors for that increase. I mean, yeah, we’re all broke right now (although you don’t need me to tell you that – you need only look at the emergence of the £7 pint). And although we might end up drinking a bottle of tequila over the space of a couple of months, a £3 pre-mixed can is far more appealing to the wallet than a £30 bottle.It doesn’t just cost less; there’s less liquid, too. Well, obviously – but at least that means it’s easier to track how much you’ve had, particularly for RTD cocktails. And, for the mental and physical health-conscious drinker, it’s much easier to quantify the units in three cans of spritz than it is to eyeball a bottle of Campari to work out the same metric. There are many new brands that, effectively, have been launched to meet this purpose, but there are also plenty of existing brands that have pivoted to meet demand.But does tinnification affect the drinking experience, and does it affect the liquid itself? New Zealand wine producerVilla Maria, known for its supermarket sauvignon, started putting its stuff in cans a couple of months ago. They’ve kept dissolved oxygen levels below 0.5 parts per million to protect aroma and flavour, and they claim this was noticeable during a six-month comparative trial between canned and bottled wines.David Roper, the group’s winemaker, also notes the reduced ecological impact of cans over bottles, because they’re lighter, infinitely recyclable and have a lower carbon footprint than glass, so benefit both the producer and the consumer.

Along with Trump’s martial takeover of Washington DC, this week’s instalment, titled Sickofancy, takes aim at artificial intelligence (specifically ChatGPT) and the larger tech-bro industry.Picking up where we last left off, the show’s resident doofus, Randy Marsh, sees his beloved Tegridy Weed marijuana farm raided by border patrol agents. They kidnap all of his workers (“Hey! Those are my Mexicans!”), leaving him with only one employee, the ever-stoned Towelie (a talking bath towel, naturally). Despondent, Randy turns toChatGPTfor advice. The sycophantic, soft-voiced app draws up a new business plan for him and Towelie to implement. With the help of a single Mexican whom they spring from an Ice detention centre and plenty of recreational ketamine, they rebrand to Techridy, “an AI-powered marijuana platform for global solutions”.Meanwhile, in Washington, President Trump takes a break from receiving lavish gifts (as well as assurances that “you do not have a small penis”) from politicians, business titans and foreign leaders to remake the capital into a dystopian police state festooned with his own image (which includes his less-than-impressive member).The two storylines converge when Randy attempts to bribe Trump into legalising marijuana nationwide by bequeathing Towelie to him. It’s all for naught, though, as ChatGPT’s advice proves useless and he ends up having to sell Tegridy Farms and move his family back to the suburbs (the end of an era for the show, which has heavily featured this subplot for seven years, much to the annoyance of some fans).Lewd, crude and politically astute: South Park’s history of controversyRead moreParker and Stone’s take on AI – that it is dumbing us down, robbing us of person-to-person connection and giving us really, really bad advice – is refreshingly clear-eyed, if not particularly incendiary. The larger skewering of tech bros is solid, although it’s slightly disappointing that Elon Musk never gets brought in for any of it, even though the running gag about ketamine addiction is clearly aimed at him. That said, the digs at Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg help fill that gap.The Trump material remains roundly funny and it’s clear the show is building to a big conclusion, most likely involving his unwilling partner and lover Satan (who is finally taking steps to free himself from the abusive relationship).This episode is unlikely to cause as big a stir as the previous two. But watching South Park satirise the horrifying militarisation of Washington DC in real time – Union Station, which features in the show’s central montage, was the scene of a fascist photo op featuring vice-president JD Vance, defence secretaryPete Hegsethand White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller – is another reminder that no show has ever worked harder to have its finger on the nation’s pulse.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionAnimation on TVUS televisionDonald TrumpPete HegsethJD VancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Specially designed ‘baby windows’ can help – but some argue they make matters worseByLaura SpinneyThu 21 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 04.51 EDTShareWhen Romina discovered she was pregnant in 2021, she was 39 years old and homeless, without a euro to her name. She did what many a lonely and frightened woman has done throughout history, on learning that she was going to have a baby, and pretended she wasn’t. “If you don’t think about it, it doesn’t exist – something like that,” she told me, more than three years on.By the time she noticed the changes in her body, she had been homeless for nearly seven years. Before that, she had lived a comfortable, secure life in The Hague, with a man she had fallen passionately in love with. But the man had become controlling, she said, preventing her from working or seeing her friends, spying on her and eventually threatening her if she left him.She left him anyway, one night around Christmas 2014, and so opened a very dark chapter in a life that, to hear Romina, had already known its fair share of darkness – her parents’ divorce when she was three; years of sexual abuse at the hands of a stepfather; her mother’s many suicide attempts, the last of which, in 2009, succeeded; estrangement from her two half-siblings; and separation from her two sons (one of whom was just a toddler) after she entered into that last, abusive relationship, leaving them with their fathers.Her ex had political clout locally, so Romina felt that the only way to prevent him from tracking her down was to disappear into the city’s shadow world. The first night on the streets was the worst, she said. It was raining and cold. She didn’t have enough money for a hotel, and the little she had, she knew she had to keep for food, so she walked, and cried. When she finally slept, after three wakeful days and nights, it was in a parking garage.For a woman alone, it can be a toss-up as to which is riskier, staying inside a homeless shelter or on the street, and except in winter, Romina preferred to take her chances outside. “It’s strange,” she said, “but only six months were very hard, because you still have hope and you know a better life. After six months you don’t know it any more, your brain goes into survival mode.” In her mind, all her ties of family and friendship fell away. Her sole preoccupations were finding food and a safe place to sleep.Romina and I spoke via a video call, because she was still nervous about revealing her whereabouts. Her laugh is full-throated and her English excellent, given that she told me she learned it from Netflix. She has a mass of blond curls and was wearing red lipstick and had a tattoo the length of her forearm. She looked younger than her 42 years.She had two lifelines during those years, she said: an old school friend who let her wash and use the internet at his place when his girlfriend was at work, and Tinder, the dating app. She would have sex with men in exchange for a bed for the night. She was aware that sounded like sex work, but said she only chose men she found attractive. With one of those men the relationship was “Netflix and chill”. They always used a condom, but she got pregnant anyway.By the time it became impossible for her to deny her condition, the relationship was petering out, so she decided not to tell the man. She tapped a query into Google – “pregnant, homeless, what now?” – and up came a name she’d never seen before, Beschermde Wieg, which is Dutch for “protected cradle”. It was the name of a foundation that ran a number of “baby rooms” across the Netherlands, places where you could give up your baby anonymously, relinquishing – without judgment – any role in that baby’s life along with any straightforward way for him or her to find you.In the moment, the anonymous option appealed to Romina. She fired off an inquiry, since the foundation also offered anonymous advice. That was how she entered into contact with the women who, by providing information and unflagging support, would help her turn her life around.She broke off from our conversation to reassure her son, now three, who was clamouring for her attention in the background. Like the vast majority of expectant parents who have enquired about baby rooms in the 11 years that they have operated in the Netherlands, Romina ended up keeping her child.The founders and staff of Beschermde Wieg insist that their rooms offer a caring alternative to the more controversial baby windows – also known as baby hatches, life windows or safe haven boxes – where a person simply deposits a baby in a secure vault, often in the wall of a public building, and walks away. To the dismay of many, this modern incarnation of the medieval foundling wheel has made a comeback since the turn of the millennium, proliferating in countries rich and poor.Beschermde Wieg believes there are enough new parents in crisis – including victims of rape or incest, fugitives and the extremely young – that it’s vital the option exists of giving up your baby anonymously.As Romina attempted to express her gratitude to the foundation, her English temporarily deserted her. Then she found the words. At the moment when her pregnancy forced her to act, she said, she trusted no one and had nothing to give. Without Beschermde Wieg, either she would have abandoned her child somewhere less safe, or she would be dead. “They saved us,” she said, simply.Infant abandonment and infanticide – which are often mentioned in the same breath – are not subjects that most people like to think about. Even Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, an anthropologist and professor emerita at the University of California, Davis, who studied them for years in the context of her wider interest in child-rearing, finds them hard topics to discuss now that she is a mother and a grandmother.Though typically rare, abandonment is documented as far back as records go. There’s plenty of evidence it predates history, too, and even the emergence of homo sapiens. Hrdy has argued that men and women are strategists hardwired to enhance their reproductive success. A pregnancy carried to term is a huge investment of resources, and usually the rational choice is to nurture and protect that investment. Very occasionally, however, circumstances arise that make the rational choice to write it off – as painful as that might be. Those circumstances include economic policies that separate new mothers from their support networks, and social conventions such as an extreme preference for sons. In her 1999 book, Mother Nature, Hrdy quotes a chilling note penned by a Roman soldier to his wife in the first century BC: “If you are delivered of child … if it is a boy keep it, if a girl discard it.”No country collects data systematically on abandonment, making it difficult to see what is driving it at a granular level. Newborn babies abandoned or killed before their existence is officially registered may, tragically, pass under the radar. We do know that abandonment reflects changes in the socioeconomic context. Today, abortion bans and crackdowns on illegal immigration areamong the factors pushing itup. In the past it was principally lack of access to maternal care, stigmatising of single mothers, and poverty. Lorraine Sherr, a psychologist at University College London who studies abandonment, calls it a “lightning rod” for society’s ills, because it’s in childbirth – when humans are at their most vulnerable – that the strains show first and most dramatically.View image in fullscreenA staff member demonstrates the baby hatch room at Jikei hospital in Kumamoto, southern Japan, June 2022.Photograph: Philip Fong/AFP/Getty ImagesSo many dead babies – more girls than boys – werebeing fishedout of the Tiber by 1198 that a Roman church had a rotating cylinder fitted into its wall. A person could place a baby in the cylinder on the street side and rotate it into the building – abandoning the child anonymously. By 1400, foundling wheels were to be seen all over Europe. You can still see one at the Innocenti, a hospital turned museum in Florence, where the wheel is covered by a grille that was supposed to prevent people from shoving in older children. Indeed, Innocenti, along with Esposito (“exposed” in English, as in “left out”), were once surnames commonly given to foundlings.By the late 18th century, abandonment rates in many European capitalshad peaked, shockingly, at about one in four births, and Hrdy has written of “epidemics of foundlings”. Misuse was suspected – birth parents presenting themselves as foster parents to collect monetary compensation, for example – and the windows began to be phased out, to be replaced in some countries by consignment offices where you were required to identify yourself. Maternity care and social services slowly improved. Methods of contraception other than abstinence became available from the 19th century, and legal abortion from the 20th – though, of course, not everywhere. Then in the late 1990s – for reasons including the decriminalisation of abandonment, and academic and media interest in the topic – the baby window was back on the scene.The typical baby window is a vault in the wall of a building – sometimes a hospital or clinic, sometimes a fire station or religious-run institution. Inside is a cradle and occasionally also writing materials in case the person depositing the baby wants to leave a note. They slide up a window, place the baby in the temperature-controlled interior and close the window again. They then have a few minutes to leave or change their mind, before the window locks and an alarm sounds inside the building.Today, baby windows can be found throughout the world, thoughthey are concentratedin regions where access to contraception and abortion is restricted. The US and Germany are outliers, with about 300 and 100 respectively. Most countries have many fewer, and the UK and France have none (the UK doesn’t allow women to give birth anonymously, France does). In 2024, a woman named Toyin Odumala, who was herself abandoned as a child,launched a petitioncalling for baby windows to be introduced in the UK, in light of thehighly publicised caseof three siblings abandoned a few years apart in the same area of east London.Sister Ancilla runs the home for mothers and babies on a quiet residential street in Krakow, Poland. Financed by a Catholic charity, the Family Accompaniment Foundation, the home currently has four women and their babies in residence. But it serves a second function, having a baby window – a “window of life” as it is called in the country – fitted into the wall on the street side.The Krakow window was the first to be inaugurated in Poland, in March 2006, at the request of Pope John Paul II. Three months later it received its first baby, a girl; since then it has received 24 others – 12 of each sex, including two sets of twins. The abandoned babies spend no more than a few hours in the home – the nuns’ role is to care for them until an ambulance arrives, and inform the family court so that the adoption process can get under way – nevertheless some of these modern foundlings have marked the sisters deeply.One premature girl was left in a shoebox, Sister Ancilla told me, wrapped in an old T-shirt, with the placenta and umbilical cord still attached – and, it transpired, drugs in her system. This was before Ancilla’s time but, she said: “There was a presumption that it probably wasn’t the mother who brought the baby. She wouldn’t have been capable.” The nuns also suspected that the woman might have been a sex worker. The little girl survived, and Ancilla believes she went on to be adopted.View image in fullscreenA foundling wheel in Udine.Photograph: Dragoncello/Getty ImagesPoland has one of themost restrictiveabortion laws in Europe, and the Krakow window – like the dozens of others across the country – is advertised through churches and welfare associations. Over the years, police spokespeople havebeen quotedby local media as saying that the number of infanticides has dropped in the Krakow region since it was installed – the implication being that it is saving lives. Asimilar claimis made by Swiss Aid for Mother and Child, the non-profit organisation that runs six of eight baby windows in Switzerland, and bySafe Haven Baby Boxes, the company that has furnished all of the US baby windows.But the data doesn’t really support these claims. Given that poverty is a known cause of abandonment, it could be rising incomes that have driven down infanticide in Poland – or lessening of the stigma attached to unmarried mothers. Sherr distinguishes between babies abandoned to live and those abandoned to die. Most experts agree that baby windows have no effect on infanticide rates, becauseforensic psychiatric evidenceindicates that women who kill their babies – many of whom conceal or deny their pregnancies, then panic when they give birth – experience a degree of emotional turmoil that precludes the planning and problem-solving that using a window entails. They could reduce the number of babies abandoned to live, some of whom will die accidentally, but the data is ambiguous on this point at best.About 700 babiesare given up in Polish hospitals each year, on average, compared with fewer than 10 via the baby windows. The hospital route is safer for mother and child, but not anonymous. Nobody can say what would happen to those 10 babies if the windows didn’t exist, and women were better informed about their rights and options. They might be abandoned in unsafe places, or their parents might choose the standard adoption route.There is even some evidence that baby windows encourage the very thing they’re designed to combat. When the Danish government was deliberating over whether to introduce them, it commissioned Laura Navne and Marie Jakobsen of the Danish National Centre for Social Research, in Copenhagen, to carry out a survey of the impact of baby windows in 10 high-income countries. The pair’s startling conclusion,published in 2021, was that “they increase the incidence of child abandonment”. The government decided against installing them.The Danish finding echoes recent historical researchconducted in Italy, showing that abandonment rates fell after the foundling wheels were phased out in the 19th century. The wheels provided both a solution for poor families with more children than they could support, the researchers found, and a secret, socially acceptable way of getting rid of babies born out of wedlock. In so doing, they entrenched the stigma attached to unmarried mothers, while fathers were unaccountable. Today’s baby windows operate in a different cultural context, but they too have that dual function, the study’s authors argued – protecting infants and perpetuating a system that fails to tackle the root causes of abandonment.About 20 years ago, in an unpublished butmuch-cited anecdotal report, Hungarian child rights advocate Mária Herczog and colleagues interviewed porters at a Budapest hospital where visitors to the baby window were captured on CCTV. The hospital had the particularity of being located in the city’s red light district, and the porters related that most of the 16 babies left there over the decade or so covered by the footage were brought by men. Who those men were, nobody knows.It’s impossible to generalise from such a small and unscientific study, but it does serve as a reminder not to assume that the mother is the one giving up her baby, or even that she has consented to do so. For Herczog, the windows cynically exploit the most vulnerable women in society, since it is often the same women providing sexual services and babies for adoption. She called the devices “profoundly anti-mother” and said that many women end up giving birth in unsafe conditions before returning to bad situations where they quickly get pregnant again: “It is not a solution.” In her view, a humane society would intervene earlier, helping women to avoid unwanted pregnancies and supporting them through wanted ones. Sherr agrees. “I always say the mother of the abandoned baby is herself abandoned,” she said.To be fair, Poland’s Family Accompaniment Foundation and Swiss Aid for Mother and Child try to intervene early,offering counsellingandsupport. But both are – or are perceived to be –anti-abortion. The founder of the Swiss organisation, Dominik Müggler, did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article, but among the 33 reasons to have a baby, posted on the organisation’s website,visitors can read: “Because God wants babies to live.” Herczog finds it telling that where the emphasis is on supporting mothers and keeping families together, as in the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland, the windows (or rooms) stand mostly unused.View image in fullscreenHôpital du Valais in Sion, Switzerland.Photograph: Posed by model/Joakim FaissIn 2016, the Swiss canton of Valais installed a baby box that is funded, not by Müggler’s organisation, but by the cantonal authorities, who wanted it to be ideologically and religiously neutral. Their aim was to reduce the infanticide rate, said the paediatrician who oversees the box, Juan Llor of the cantonal hospital at Sion, who was personally sceptical that it would have that effect. Since 2016, seven babies have been given up for adoption in the canton’s hospitals, but not one has been placed in the box. “If the baby box is used, that’s a failure of care for the pregnant woman and the family,” Llor said, adding that his initial scepticism had been vindicated: the window had had no impact on the Valais infanticide rate.The residents of the Krakow mother-and-baby home are in no doubt that an anonymous solution is needed. Several of them wrote me letters telling me how, though they couldn’t have imagined giving up their own babies, they could easily understand women in situations only slightly more perilous than theirs choosing that path.Beschermde Wieg, the Dutch organisation that Romina credits with saving her life, thinks it has found a happy medium – a way to offer anonymity humanely. It was founded byBarbara Müller, who previously worked in child protection, where she saw too many children let down by a dysfunctional care system, and concluded that more needed to be done early on, to keep families together. So in 2013, in her home town of Dordrecht, sheset up a homewhere pregnant women or new mothers could find temporary accommodation and support.A year later Müller decided that she still wasn’t reaching the most vulnerable women – those whose desperate circumstances forced them to hide their pregnancies and to abandon or kill their newborns. She shared her frustration with her friend Kitty Nusteling, a mother of five who was working in the private sector then, organising childcare for middle-class families. Nusteling realised that she, too, would rather help women in greater need.At the time, around five abandoned babies were being found each year in the Netherlands, most of them lifeless. “And you can ask yourself the question, how many babies are not found?” said Nusteling. She and Müller felt that many new mothers in crisis might just need some respite, and that if they got it they would eventually – and joyfully – take their babies back. They decided to provide that respite, in anonymity and with no ideological or religious slant. “We’re pro-choice, we’re not pro-life,” said Nusteling.Uncomfortable with the somewhat brutal image of a hatch through which you pass your baby, never to see him or her again, theyconceived of a roomcomplete with child-friendly murals, cuddly toys and a sheepskin-lined rocking chair. A person couldn’t give birth in the room, but they could spend undisturbed time there, settling the baby in and saying goodbye to him or her – also, importantly, browsing literature about the other options available – before pressing the button that would signal the baby’s presence, and leaving. Since Müller’s plan contravened Dutch law, which protects a child’s right to know its origins – a right enshrined in theUN Convention on the Rights of the Child– she decided to keep the baby room separate from the mother-and-baby home so as not to expose the latter to legal risk. So Beschermde Wieg, of which Nusteling is director of operations, was born in the converted garage of a volunteer’s house in Dordrecht.The law could apply to anyone seen as enabling or provoking anonymous abandonment, as well as to the person actually abandoning, and the punishment could include a hefty fine and jail time. Müller said that the first time a woman brought her baby to the room, she was invited to the justice ministry, interrogated and threatened with prison, but the threat didn’t materialise. Eventually she was summoned to an official hearing at the ministry where she just kept repeating her line: “You are reading the UN convention in the wrong way.” In focusing on article 7, about a child’s right to know their birth parents, she explained that officials had overlooked article 6, which defends a child’s right to life. Müller argued that a person could only wonder about who gave birth to them if they were alive.View image in fullscreenA baby hatch in Płock, Poland.Photograph: Marcin Rogozinski/AlamyIn 2019, the government changed its stance. Though anonymous abandonment remained illegal, operating and using the rooms would no longer be punishable. The foundation even received funding from the Dutch health ministry after that, though nowadays it relies on private donations to pay for the 14 baby rooms – 13 fixed and one mobile – that it runs across the country, including nine in hospitals.If someone wants to give up a baby in the Netherlands, theofficial procedurebegins with the child being placed with a foster family for three months. At the end of that period, the birth parents have an opportunity to change their mind. If they don’t, the baby goes to an adoptive family, but the birth parents have a say in the choice of that family. Their identity is kept on record, and the child can obtain it, if he or she wants to, upon turning adult.Beschermde Wieg respects this protocol scrupulously, but it inserts the extra option of anonymity. Many parents in crisis are drawn to the baby room, Nusteling said, but few ultimately choose it. Of the roughly 1,700 who contact the foundation each year, 17 give up their babies, around two-thirds of whom later reclaim them. The foundation’s goal is to reach the mother as early as possible in the pregnancy, and to help her change her situation – to get an education, say, or to escape a violent partner. Itwantsthe rooms to stand empty.Beschermde Wieg was vilified to begin with, but as it shared more of the nameless women’s stories, the criticism became more muted. “People saw over 10 years that there were not long queues of women wanting to give up their babies,” said Nusteling. “It’s not easy.” They also saw that the women weren’t all illegal immigrants – a common misconception. There were some of those, but there were also Polish women providing Dutch companies with cheap labour; young, unmarried Dutch women belonging to a strict Protestant denomination; and middle-aged ones like Romina, fleeing Dutch men with political influence. Perhaps, adds Müller, they also saw that there could be courage – and sense – in sacrificing your own desires to give your child a better life.During Romina’s first exchange with Beschermde Wieg, she agreed to a prenatal scan four days later. It was January 2022. “The next day it was very cold outside,” she said. “It was raining and all my clothes were wet.” She fell sick and called the foundation, which arranged for an ambulance to pick her up. At the hospital she learned that she was three months pregnant. Technically she could still have requested an abortion, but having seen what she saw on the ultrasound screen, she decided that was no longer an option.Feeling trapped and frightened, her mind zeroed in on the baby room. Nusteling and her colleagues dissuaded her from taking an irreversible decision too soon, and she agreed to a period of foster care. She gave birth on a Friday, in hospital, by caesarean section. Given that she would only keep her baby for a few days, the medical staff advised her not to breastfeed him. “I did it sneakily!” she said. The following Monday, the foster parents came. Handing him over to them was the hardest thing she has ever done, she said, but she felt she had no choice. She was still homeless. If she didn’t give him up, child protection would surely take him away from her.She spent the next three months in a psychiatric facility, half the time sedated to help her cope with the emotional maelstrom that losing her baby pitched her into. “The first three weeks were awful because your body is screaming for a baby but there isn’t a baby,” she said. After six weeks she saw her son again, as the law required, and decided that she would do whatever it took to get him back. A judge agreed that she could have him, on condition that she found them a place to live. Beschermde Wieg’s sister organisation offered her a room in one of its mother-and-baby homes, and when her son was three months old they moved into it, taking a single bag of clothes.Three abandoned children, two missing parents and a 40-year mysteryRead moreRomina has some outstanding debts to The Hague city authorities. She is on welfare and feels guilty that there is no father figure in her son’s life. But she is slowly getting back on her feet, and has re-established contact with her older sons. Last Mother’s Day, they came to visit. She shows me a picture of her middle son playing with his younger half-brother, her arms encircling them both. All three are smiling.When her youngest starts school, in a year’s time, she plans to find work. She and Nusteling have discussed the possibility of her joining Beschermde Wieg, to advise women going through experiences similar to hers. She knows it won’t be easy – for a start, she’s the perimenopausal single parent of an energetic three-year-old – but she can’t get over how lucky she’s been, or how surrounded she feels by kind people. “I have a beautiful home, I have food on the table, I have a shower, I have clothes,” she said. “Every day feels like a dream.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readParents and parentingChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It could shape the future, for good or illThu 21 Aug 2025 10.46 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareRemember Jacob Rees-Mogg, Brexit opportunities and government efficiency minister, lurking round Whitehall offices to leavesarcastic printed cardson any empty desk: “Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. With every good wish”? The following year his government ordered the entire civil service to attend the office a minimum of 60% of the time. That has led to strikes and disputes over hybrid working, including at the Land Registry, among Metropolitan police civilians and at the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Covid taught many lessons: one of the best was discovering that people can work flexibly, need not waste time and money commuting, and can take jobs far from home while employers recruit the best from anywhere.The ONS is in so much trouble, from top to toe, you might think it would hasten to resolve this morale-lowering dispute, which appears symptomatic of what went wrong with its recently departed leadership. This week it hit yet more trouble,delaying crucial retail sales figuresto carry out further data “quality assurance”.Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) members havevoted yet againto continue their 18-month-old dispute with the ONS: 68% voted for strike action on a 71% turnout. It’s been an oddly quiet dispute: staff went on working their usual hybrid patterns, for their usual pay. But ONS bosses feel obliged to follow the 2023 civil service edict to dragoon staff into the office. This time staff are taking zero-attendance action.“What impact has hybrid working had on the ONS?” I asked the ONS spokesperson: the nation’s statisticians should have the best grasp on any research. Being an honest outfit, the press officer said: “We don’t know … We suspect there might be a bad impact, especially on younger staff, but it’s hard to quantify.” He said there was flexibility, and department leaders made special arrangements for some. Indeed, I spoke to one half of a couple working for the ONS, who were mystified as to why one of them could work from home while the other had to attend five days a week.The PCS general secretary, Fran Heathcote,argued last yearthat “applying arbitrary targets on office attendance doesn’t increase productivity and is unpopular with staff”. She said that if the government “want a motivated, hard-working workforce, ministers should trust their own employees to have some say over their working conditions”. The employees are mostly data analysts, many not only with maths or science bachelor degrees, but masters too: I spoke to one among many with PhDs. They are hard to recruit and harder to retain: other government departments pay more and the private sector a lot more. That makes flexibility and good treatment especially valuable. Autonomy and flexibility are so highly prized that research from the global expert Nick Bloom, a British professor of economics at Stanford University, suggests that people value it as much as an 8% pay increase, making themhappier and more productivewhen working partly from home. Women are farmore likely to quitif forced back to full-time office working: compelling a daily commute narrows their choices and widens the pay gap.This is a dilemma mostly of the higher-paid. About 60% of the workforce arefully at their place of work: you can’t serve in a shop, teach, nurse, care, cook, keep the sewers and electricity flowing or build from home. From scaffolders to surgeons, many have no choice, but the office-based are more likely to be graduates. WFH has settled into an average ofa quarter of all working days, a revolutionary five-fold increase on pre-Covid figures. At first sight, Nigel Farageseems again to miss the popular heartbeatwhen he pledges “no more working from home” in the 10 councils his party controls.It was enjoyably typical that his party was caught out advertising nine organising jobs as “home working with occasional travel”. But he does catch that macho management spirit, anti-civil service, anti-office workers, anti-graduates by implication. It’s a class gesture. It chimes with the Trump-Musk assault echoed among the titans: JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock, Amazon and UPS re-imposed five days in the office. Google’s co-founder Sergey Brinsent a memoclaiming, “60 hours is the sweet spot of productivity”. Like most posturing, this suggests insecurity and incapacity among managers: if they can’t see hands on keyboards, how do they know work is done?Some employers need to catch up with Angela Rayner’s radical shift in power towards the workforce, arriving soon with heremployment rights bill. Employers will need to give good reasons for refusing what the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) predicts will be more than a third asking forflexible and hybrid working. For those rooted to their workplace, they suggest alternatives such as compressed working in four-day weeks. Many employers do get the message: 41% tell a CIPD survey that increased home/hybrid working has led to increased productivity/efficiency; only 16% say the opposite.In a country where the best jobs are concentrated in London and the south-east, where housing is beyond the reach of most, hybrid working opens the door to the most competitive roles without the associated housing and commuting costs, letting employers choose from far afield. Flexibility has to work both ways – but most people want good contact with their offices. Sadly I hear of young people with London jobs wanting to work more from their office but unable to afford the commute.The ONS could lead the way out of this Rees-Mogg nonsense. Its confession that neither itsemployment figuresnor itswealth statisticsare reliable enough to use follows a devastating inquiry by the Commons public administration committee whose chair described agrossly dysfunctional hierarchywhere the chief statistician behaved like a “hybrid of a Medici prince and Blofeld” in a “boosterish chumocracy”, while theONS itself reportedpoor communication between the leadership and junior staff.Earlier this month the ONS acquired a new permanent secretary, with a chance to blow away old management and civil service attitudes. The PCS is optimistic. Abandoning needless presenteesism, the ONS might win back prizes it used to earn as a “best place to work”.All this is a destructive and pointless tug of war over power. Managers may prefer to see people at desks, but for many who take jobs while carefully calculating rents, house prices, commuting costs and childcare complexities, flexibility is not a nice-to-have feature but the difference between taking and leaving a job. It matters far more to the staff than to the Rees-Mogg/Faragist macho management poseurs.

But why bury good news? No banner headline announced that the Prince of Wales is tomove house. He is to go from Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Home Park to the nearby Forest Lodge.That was not the real news. “Sources” said the switch was the outcome of Prince William’s “brutal” past year, in which both his wife and his father, King Charles, received treatment for cancer. This had led him to ponder the future of the monarchy, no less. He means to “reshape the institution he will lead … to be fit for purpose in the modern era”.The move to what William intends to be his family’s forever home is apparently symbolic of that reshaping. Above all, it is goodbye,Buckingham Palace. Charles’s current refusal to move his residence there from Clarence House is to be permanent.William’s eight-bedroom Forest Lodge is actually smaller than the couple’s country retreat of Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate. It has a handsome interior but,valued at £16m, it is no grander than an average Kensington mansion. More to the point, the house is to be exceptionally private, within and without. The royal family will reportedly have no live-in staff. William apparently wants to be a normal father who, even as king, wants to be seen on the school run.This is the most drastic move out of town by a British monarch since the Hanoverians deserted St James’s for Kew. William could have moved to his grandmother’s palace in Windsor Castle. He chose not to. He will also have his dissolute uncle, Prince Andrew, occupying the much larger 31-room mansion at Royal Lodge just down the road. He is clearly determined to join the modest ranks of the “bicycling monarchs” of Scandinavia and the Low Countries.In years past, there were intimations that the present king wanted to slim down the paraphernalia of monarchy. We have seen few examples of it in practice. Thecoronation ceremonywas still out of the dark ages. Nonsenses such as the king’s speech, the changing of the guard andMaundy moneystumble on. William had to dress up andspend a day at Royal Ascot, which he is said to hate.

He wants to strip Britain’s monarchy of what thepeerless commentator Walter Bagehotcalled its “mystical and theatrical” dignities. A hereditary head of state has legitimacy only insofar as the state grants its consent. For that to be the case nowadays, he or she should seem as normal and uncontroversial as seems fitting. A majority of Britonsstill supporttheir monarchy, though only about one-third of under-25s.A bicycling monarchy is what it says. It implies an ordinary person doing an extraordinary job as the personification of a nation, not one anointed “by God” after undressing in a church cubicle. Dutch monarchs havecycledsince the 19th century.The Dutch king used to bea part-time airline pilot. These royal families are not turned into tortured celebrities as press officers seek headlines about their “making a difference”.The heir to Britain’s throne might have been perfectly cast for the job, given the possible alternatives. But the future lies ahead. One thing emphatically not yet sorted is the royal estate. This rambling arrangement of ancient buildings, storerooms and cobwebbed attics is a relic of the British empire left to gather dust. What does William intend to do with Buckingham Palace, St James’s Palace, Kensington Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham and Balmoral, not to mention his father’s Clarence House and Highgrove? If France, Austria and Spain can forget their empires and set their palaces free, Britain can surely do likewise. Versailles, Hofburg andEl Escorialno longer shelter royal uncles, aunts and cousins.Can a nation in crisis rely on the baby boomer generation to step up? I think the UK is about to find out | Phillip InmanRead moreIndeed, if the monarch is to be content with a hideaway in Windsor Park, his family had better watch out. The most his son George might expect is a two-bedroom semi in Clapham. As for Charlotte and Louis, what chance of a cosy bedsit in Stoke Newington? They would probably be happier that way.The clear answer is to treat these palaces as some are treated now, opened to the public as museums of royalty in the care of the Historic Royal Palaces agency. The real excitement should be Buckingham Palace and its gardens. The house would be a fine museum and art gallery of monarchy. But what of its gardens?Every royal park in London was donated to the public at some point in history by a monarch. Charles I gave us Hyde Park and Charles II St James’s. Regent’s Park was opened under William IV and Kensington Gardens under Queen Victoria. The Windsors have as yet given nothing.Buckingham Palace has the largest private garden in London. Its 16 hectares (39 acres) lie unused and unappreciated in the heart of town. Tearing down its walls and merging it with Green Park has often been mooted, but for obvious reasons never dared.Such a gift to London would be unequalled in Europe. It would also be a symbol of monarchical descent to normality. The gardens would complete a vale of greenery stretching across west London from Westminster to Notting Hill. They could be filled with bicycling monarchs.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Something practical, sustainable and affordable shouldn’t be too much to askThu 21 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 10.41 EDTShareSomething big is about to happen to households acrossEngland. Exhausted parents at the playground, wild-eyed as they respond to work emails while their kids charge past with anarchic abandon, gather their final ounces of energy. “Liberation day is coming,” they whisper. Finally, after six weeks of summer holidays, the kids are going back to school.But my own heady excitement at regaining some semblance of routine come September has been derailed by an adjacent exercise: procuring my daughter’s first school uniform. Call me curmudgeonly, but there’s few things I resent more than spending more than £300 to dress my four-year-old in a suit and tie.The British obsession with forcing children into business attire from an age when they can’t yet read or write is surely a form of national delirium. School uniform undoubtedly has worthy roots. It has prevailed in most schools since the 19th century, when it was introduced as a means to reduce the appearance of socioeconomic disparities and create a sense of community and cohesion. But can we say with any conviction that uniforms in their current tradition still do that?So extortionate they have become that someparents in England are skipping mealsand turning to buy now, pay later services such as Klarna to afford them before the autumn term, according to a survey by the parenting charity Parentkind.At the small, south London state primary my daughter attends, the blazer alone costs £38. The branded cardigan, made of 50% acrylic, is £23. These, alongside the other compulsory items on the school’s list, must be bought from one specialist uniform supplier. Delivery is another £8. Ordered the wrong size? That’s a shame – returns are at your expense, unless you would rather go to the physical store, a mere 45 minutes and two train rides away in the neighbouring borough of Croydon. The school’s secondhand uniform shop thrives but is a victim of its own success – only the most organised can snap up the available stock in the required sizes before it sells out before the summer term is even over. It’s almost like the whole process has been designed to ramp up your blood pressure by 10 points.Government messaging says schools should make uniforms affordable and work with families who struggle to afford them. But there is no benchmark to say how they should be priced, nor any set rules that schools have to abide by. Indeed, some schools ask for as many as 10 branded items, pushing the cost of a child’s uniform with PE kitup to £400. The government recognises the problem – it has plans to limit branded student kit to three articles, plus a tie, from September 2026 in England, and the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has urged schools to bring in reasonable measures beforehand. “You don’t need a posh blazer to learn your times tables, and Shakespeare is just as inspiring in a supermarket sweater,” shewrote on X. I couldn’t agree more – especially when said blazer will probably be lost in the first week of term.Friends tell me they uphold a quiet form of resistance. One says that after her five-year-old lost his blazer twice in a row, she simply refused to replace it until the following year and ignored the headteacher’s protests. But in other parts of the country, it has become commonplace to hear stories of children being excluded for not wearing the correct uniform. I can’t help but wonder if these incidents could have been avoided if schools simply had more accommodating rules. And of course,enforcing dress codesfalls to our notoriously time-rich teachers – as if teaching in 2025 doesn’t already give them enough to contend with.There is an argument that uniforms help to drive up standards, that being smartly dressed encourages a level of engagement with education. Or, for schools in big cities struggling to attract pupils, maybe it’s a way for them to stand out – a form of advertising their high standards. Private school-inspired uniform must appeal to some socially ambitious parents. But research on the impact of uniforms is mixed. “There is little robust evidence that introducing a school uniform will, by itself, improve academic performance, behaviour, or attendance,” says theEducation Endowment Foundation. And however much uniforms have been modernised, they remain heavily gendered.New researchfrom the University of Cambridge found school uniform policies could even be restricting young people from being active, particularly primary school-age girls.Anecdotal evidencesuggests most uniforms are made from synthetic materials, chock full of forever chemicals that are breathed in when our children get hot. As our climate becomes more unpredictable and our school buildings suddenly feel woefully unfit to cope with the changing temperatures, it feels more important than ever that our children are dressed comfortably and that the fabrics they wear are not just breathable but also sustainable.Despite my protests, I’m not arguing for uniform to be abolished. Who could dislike its practicality on already chaotic school mornings? And I think they do achieve something unquantifiable in fostering a sense of community and cohesion. But here is my plea for reason: make them affordable, sustainable, and while we’re here make them easy to get hold of, replace and clean.At the heart of this issue is an existential question: what is school for? For children to develop and learn? Or to mould them in a one-dimensional way? Today we accept that success and achievement can look many different ways. And it doesn’t always come dressed in a suit and tie.Lucy Pasha-Robinson is an assistant editor on Guardian OpinionExplore more on these topicsSchoolsOpinionParents and parentingSchool brandingEducation policyChildrenEnglandFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

While it is normal for retailers to receive payments from suppliers related to the volume of goods sold, or promotional activity, accounting rules are strict. The sums must be booked as they are earned. In a multi-year agreement, payments cannot all be taken upfront.WH Smith’s last annual report was also clear that the principle should be straightforward to put into practice: “The level of complexity and judgment is low in relation to establishing the accounting entries and estimates, and the timing of recognition.”Thusa £30m profits overstatementin WH Smith’s North American division – “largely due to the accelerated recognition of supplier income” – is enormous in the context of the size of the operation. The estimate of headline trading profits in the unit this year has been cut from £55m to £25m.Group-wide profits should still arrive at £110m this year because the UK operation – think shiny shops in airports and railway stations, rather than the now-sold dusty high street stores – is still bigger. But the 42% fall in the group’s share price on Thursday, equating to almost £600m in terms of stock-market value, still looks more than justified.North America was meant to be the gleaming growth opportunity for WH Smith. The promise,after the sale of its UK high street shops, was for a pure “global travel” retailer with a single-minded focus on expanding its presence. Its US business takes in a tech and gadget format, InMotion, plus stores for other retailers. About 40 shops were opened in US airports last year on the way to making the division “an increasingly significant part of the group”, as Carl Cowling, the chief executive, put it.At least for now, the expansion plans are intact and it’s just a question of correcting the accounting errors and waiting for Deloitte, a freshly appointed independent reviewer, to run a forensic check on all the supplier contracts. Well, let’s see. These types of accounting cock-ups rarely become smaller on closer inspection and the affair raises questions that Cowling, the chair, Annette Court, and the board haven’t begun to address.For starters, WH Smith investors will want a comprehensive account of how the financial controls could have failed so badly that more than half this year’s promised profits from the US could evaporate in one swoop. Then they will want to know the degree to which the US operation is dependent on supplier payments. What would returns look like without them? As Peel Hunt’s analyst said: “Bigger questions remain about the margin structure of the US businesses.”Come back in November for WH Smith’s full-year numbers and its complete version of what went wrong. Until then, the shares – now at the lowest in a decade – look like dead money. The US rollout plan requires projections shareholders can believe.Explore more on these topicsWH SmithNils Pratley on financeRetail industrycommentShareReuse this content"

We’re scroungers, rapists,fighting-age menwho shouldn’t have left our home countries. Sometimes we’re simply “illegals”, the most dehumanising term of all. When did it become a crime to run for your life?The people levelling these accusations are superb at making themselves heard. Mud sticks – and most of us are too scared to try to set the record straight. I don’t know how many of our accusers have sat down with us, human to human, and listened to our stories. Here’s mine.I grew up in Syria. My childhood was safe and happy – idyllic when I look back at it. In 2011, theArab springand civil war in Syria changed everything. I was imprisoned twice for protesting against theAssad regime,but it never crossed my mind to leave. Like many young people, I never thought death would come for me.Everything changed when I was almost killed in a deadly missile attack in a suburb of Aleppo I was only 17, and I realised that I wanted to live. So I escaped. First to Turkey, and then I travelled through Europe until I reached Calais. I hoped to reach the UK for two reasons. First, my auntie and cousins live here. After my mum died when I was 14, my auntie became a second mum to me. Second, I could speak English. The thing people don’t understand about refugees is how tired we are from what we have been through. All I could think about was resting and being with my auntie.I spent 10 months in Calais trying to get to Britain. It was before small boat crossings become the main method of getting here, but the smugglers were there. We all hated them because they made it more difficult for us to cross the Channel without them. I tried every way I could: lorries, cargo trains, sneaking into the port to try to conceal myself on a ferry.At that time the French police wereattacking migrants, as they do now. Sometimes they would be helpful and tell us things such as what time border guards changed shift – that was the best time to try to sneak on to a train or a lorry. Sometimes we were wished good luck by French and British border force and police; some saw us as humans, some saw us as criminals.When I made it to the UK in 2017, I thought I had finally found safety, but my experience with the Home Office reminded me that I hadn’t. I always felt as if I was being treated like a criminal. I was required to report to a police station regularly, and it took more than two years to get a decision on my asylum case.Government aside, in that period British society was generally more welcoming towards people such as me. I could walk down the street in one of the UK’s diverse cities and blend in. I met wonderful people who always made me feel as if I belonged.Everything changed when the previous government introduced the now-cancelled Rwanda scheme. People wereput in detention centresand threatened with deportation. Although I had been granted leave to remain by then, I was really scared that the government would come after me too and deport me. That fear has grown even more since the Home Office changed its policy this February: people like me who entered irregularly will now “normally be refused citizenship”. One of the nightmares I often have is of shouting for help in the middle of the street when no one can hear me. I now feel I am living that dream.Now that I havelived in the UKfor a few years, I understand the politics better. People just want someone to blame for the state of the economy and public services – and migrants and refugees are the easiest to blame. Some believe the lies about us. I work as a cinematographer and also volunteer with a charity as an Arabic interpreter. I speak to a lot of age-disputed young people who the Home Office insists are adults and have been placed in adult hotels. It is so obvious when I listen to them speak that they are children. They cry down the phone to me. They hate being in hotels, forced to share rooms with adults they don’t know.Most refugees dream of returning home if it becomes safe to do so. I often think back to the secure time of my childhood. I grew up with the scents of jasmine and geranium in my garden. I have planted those things here to try to recreate a sense of home. No matter what I do here to contribute, I feel I will always be viewed as a criminal and someone at risk of being sent back to my country, however unsafe it is.Open, explicit racism seems to be on the rise in Britain. It starts with refugees like me and other migrants – but they will soon come for other people simply because they are not white, or belong to the “wrong” religion, or their sexual orientation. Unless we act now, things are going to get worse.As told to Diane TaylorAyman Alhussein is a Syrian film-maker based in LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And what could be more unlikely than wondering about the dire prospects of humankind through the prism of the Big Light? That’s right, the lightbulb in the middle of the ceiling, the main light, the one operated from the wall switch that you instinctively feel around for when you enter a room. IfTikTokis to be believed, people around the world are saying “Down with the Big Light”, with videos that urge viewers never to use it and claim turning it on is a dating red flag garnering millions of views – all of which has left me wondering: truly, is nothing sacred?I confess that defending the Big Light has long been a personal mission. My husband is a lamp guy. He values “mood”, whereas if I am unable to read a clothing care label or find a contact lens because it’s so dark, the only mood I find myself in is “fuming”. I don’t want to have to scuttle around a room turning on five lamps to achieve the amount of light the Big Light delivers. Even among our friends, the tide has turned, with one now openly trading in Big-Light falsehoods: “They are always just horrible blue lights beaming down on you, like you are being interrogated.”But as the anti-Big Light sheeple gather momentum, let me be the lone voice of reason: the Big Light is good. We would miss it if it went. Yes, it has its limitations, but it’s practical, affordable, egalitarian, and it lays the foundation for a quality of life for anyone in that room no matter where they stand. Must we tear it down? Why can’t we work with it, and add lamps to complement it; why can’t we improve it and, in doing so, improve ourselves?Indeed, this is a sentiment I find myself expressing a lot these days – whether it’s when I’m talking to people about the BBC and getting rid of the licence fee, or the UN.

It’s about democracyThu 21 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 12.29 EDTShareIt may be difficult for a real-estate mogul like Donald Trump to recognize, but Vladimir Putin’s invasion ofUkraineis not about slices of war-torn land in eastern Ukraine. It is about Ukraine’s democracy. Putin fears that the Russian people will see that democracy as an enticing alternative to his stultifying autocratic rule. Trump is unlikely to secure a peace deal unless he acts on that reality and changes the cost-benefit analysis behind Putin’s continuing war.Much of the public analysis of the Alaskasummitbetween Trump and Putin, and the Washington collection ofEuropean leadersprotecting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, from the temperamental Trump, has been replete with red-herring issues. For example, Putin did not invade Ukraine because of fearedNatoexpansion. Theunanimousconsent of all Nato members required to admit Ukraine is nowhere on the horizon, especially sincearticle 5of the Nato treaty would require all Nato members to defend Ukraine from the ongoing Russian incursion.Ironically, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has strengthened Nato. It encouraged Sweden and Finland tojointhe alliance. It led Nato members to vow to dramatically increase their defense expenditures to5%of their gross domestic product. And it has made some Nato membersmorelikely to deploy troops in Ukraine as part of a “reassurance force” to secure a possible peace deal.Nor did Putin invade toliberatethe Ukrainian people from the rule of Zelenskyy, whom he regards asillegitimateand even a “neo-Nazi”. This claim is rich because Zelenskyy was chosen in a free and fairelection, but Putin risked only anelectoral charadewhile imprisoning, ultimatelylethally, his most charismatic opponent, Alexei Navalny.And the war is not about Putin’s pining to resurrect the Soviet Union, whose collapse heseesas “the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century”. That logic would endanger the other 13 former Soviet states, three of which – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – are Nato members.Rather, Putin invaded Ukraine to quash its democracy. Unlike the established democracies of Europe, Ukraine looks too much like Russia for Putin to ignore the possibility that Russians will see an alternative future in its accountable, elected government. Like Russia, Ukraine is Slavic and Orthodox. And far from a small statelet, Ukraine, with thesecondlargest population among post-Soviet states after Russia, cannot be ignored.Putin has long preferred Ukraine as a Kremlin vassal state. TheEuromaidanprotests of 2013-14, which ousted Ukraine’s pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych after hesuspendedtalks for a closer relationship with the European Union, led to Putin’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea and parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.Today, Putin’s most controversial demands would enhance the possibility of Kyiv’s renewed subordination. His insistence that Ukraine hand over large portions of Donetsk province – the “land swaps” that Trump casually suggests – would relinquishfar moreland than Russia has managed to take by force since November 2022, at enormous cost in Russian soldiers’ lives – land that had been home tohundreds of thousandsof Ukrainians.It would also compel Ukrainian forces to abandon keydefensive lines– Ukraine’s “fortress belt’’– that stand in the way of Russianseizureof much larger chunks of territory. Comparisons with Neville Chamberlain’s 1938 appeasement of Adolf Hitler bysacrificingCzechoslovakia’s Sudetenland – a prelude to war – would be inevitable. Putin’s demand that Ukrainedisarmwould make Russia’s further aggression even easier.Precluding that possibility is why security guarantees are so important for Ukraine. Given that Putin has ahistoryof ignoring agreements with Ukraine, Kyiv reasonably wants some assurance that the Russian military will not use a lull in the fighting to replenish itsdiminishedforces, rearm and reinvade. The best guarantee would be a European peacekeeping force on the ground, but European governments understandably seek a US backstop to deter Russian attack. Trump’s statedwillingnessto considerair supportfor a European force is an important step forward. The Russian government’s insistence on the power tovetoany security guarantees raises obvious questions about Putin’s intentions.For now, Putin seems to see advantage in continuing the war. To avoid angering Trump, he hasn’t outrightrefusedto meet with Zelenskyy but isslow-walkingthe matter by insisting on time-consuming prior steps. Given that Putin’s quest to undermine Ukraine’s democracy stems from his calculation of what it takes to retain power, the only way to soften his maximalist demands is by making his recalcitrance even more politically costly.This is where Trump has a role to play. Entering the Alaska summit, Trump had threatened “severe consequences” if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire. The mercurial Trump then seemingly abandoned that threat after a few hours with Putin.Trump could take various steps that would force Putin to recalibrate the rationale for his war. Trump could increase the supply ofarmsto Ukraine. He could further usetariffsto deter the sale of oil and gas that prop up the Russian military. He could press European governments to devote to Ukraine’s defense and rebuilding the$300bnof sovereign Russian assets that are now frozen in western accounts.It is deeply disturbing that matters of war and peace, democracy and autocracy,dependon stroking and flattering the fragile ego of the self-absorbed Trump. But that is the world we live in.European leaders have an essential role to play in nudging him in the right direction. They must get Trump to overcome his usual disdain for democratic rule, and admiration for autocrats like Putin, to acknowledge the centrality of defending Ukraine’s democracy for any fair resolution of the Ukraine conflict.These are counterintuitive steps for the American president. But if he wants to orchestrate an end to the horrible slaughter in Ukraine, he will have to summon the vision to take them.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

The cohort who received their GCSE results on Thursday did not take Sats at the end of primary school. Their crucial transition to secondary education was disrupted, with students missing chunks of formal learning and experiences such as school trips.This year’s strong results should thus be celebrated as a triumph over adversity. Teachers deserve enormous credit for stewarding these pupils through what is always a demanding set of tests. Likelast week’s A-levels, however, these results also give rise to concerns. Chief among these are the widening attainment gaps between richer and poorer areas, and between better-off and disadvantaged pupils.Predictably, the poorest children havesuffered the worst effectsfrom Covid disruption. On some metrics, including school attendance, decades of progress have unravelled. The number of candidates passing compulsory resits of maths and English has also declined – a situation rightly described by one exam board chief, Jill Duffy, as a crisis. Rectifying the unjust situation whereby there is no pupil premium after year 11 would be a good start.Bridget Phillipson has already announced theexpansionof a scheme offering dedicated support and mentoring to schools in England that are “stuck”. But while pupils in the north-east and north-west continue to score lower grades on average than those in and around London, this is not a simple tale of north and south. Comparing pre- and post-pandemic outcomes, anew reportfrom the Institute for Government (IfG) highlights complexities that require fresh approaches.While councils have lost most of the power they once had over schools, the significant attainment gap between the least and most successful local authority areas points to some highly localised, place-specific effects. Multiple attempts to boost results in towns such as Blackpool have failed.New thinkingand resources will be needed to achieve turnarounds.Another issue is understanding what kinds of schools serve disadvantaged pupils best.Schoolswith a mix of social backgrounds and abilities are the long-established preference of progressives. But the evidence from the IfG is complex: it finds examples both of disadvantaged pupils benefiting from socially mixed settings, and of them doing better in primary schools where they are clustered – perhaps because teachers there are more focused on their needs.SomeLondonboroughs, meanwhile, are a law unto themselves, outperforming other areas by wide margins despite high levels of disadvantage (evidence suggests Birmingham and Manchester may be on similar trajectories). While the gap between boys’ and girls’ results shrank slightly this year, differences between ethnic groups are significant yet hard to summarise. When disadvantaged schools are compared, those with higher proportions of pupils with English as an additional language do better.Overall, the results give cause for reassurance about young people’s resilience. But relief that some of the worst predictions about the pandemic have not come true must not obscure the fact thatmore than 40%of pupils missed the crucial grade 4 in maths and English. There are other problems with GCSEs, and exams and assessment in general. But too-rigid rules around resits, and the wider question of how to improvepost-16 options, are the most pressing.Explore more on these topicsGCSEsOpinionExamsSchoolsEducation policyStudentsPovertyCoronaviruseditorialsShareReuse this content"

It is famously hard to achieve when fronting a party that was recently expelled from office.Kemi Badenoch is struggling with that challenge in most areas, but especially with regard to immigration and asylum. Mrs Badenochhas warnedthat “Britain is being mugged” by foreigners who treat the country as “the world’s softest touch”. She has urged Conservative-run local authorities to follow the example of Epping council, which this week was granted an injunction by thehigh courtto prevent asylum seekers being housed in hotels. On that point she had already been upstaged by Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, who joined protests at the hotel in question, mingling in a crowd alongside notorious far-right activists.Rival parties have been quick to point out that the Conservatives’ appalling record of managing the asylum system in general, and the accommodation question in particular, disqualifies them from commenting on the subject. Nigel Farage has called Mr Jenrick a “fraud” on the grounds that he was theresponsible ministerin September 2023, when the number of asylum claimants housed in hotels peaked at 56,042. Official figuresreleased on Thursdayshow that that number was down to 32,059 at the end of June this year – lower than in March but higher than a year ago.Labour insists that it is bringing the situation under control, noting that the backlog of asylum cases is falling. Over time, that should ease pressure for temporary accommodation. But the government struggles to make a case for patience and incremental change when the terms of debate are framed by opportunists and demagogues waging a campaign of social division.There is little space for a rational conversation about fair asylum processes when prominent politicians depict all claimants as criminals and cast the entire system as a conspiracy to transfer public resources from native-born Britons to undeserving foreign interlopers. Those paranoid, xenophobic assumptions are not new, but their capture of mainstream politics has accelerated recently. In part, that expresses the cowardice of a Labour government that projects more anxiety about Britain somehow becoming an “island of strangers” than it does for the systemic corrosion of refugee rights.But it is also a symptom of moral collapse in a Conservative party that finds its function as the official opposition eclipsed by Reform UK, with Mr Farage playing the role of prime minister in waiting. Mrs Badenoch looks intellectually and strategically paralysed by her predicament. She claims not to make common cause with Reform while refusing to articulate any ideological distinction between the two parties. Mr Jenrick openly manoeuvres to replace her as leader and, in the process, erases any remaining distinction between traditional Conservatism and radical anti-immigrant nationalism. A party that was once a broad church is folding itself up into a narrow hardline sect.Mr Jenrick’sdefeatin last year’s leadership contest suggests that there is – or was then – a substantial portion of the party that mistrusts his agenda. Some MPs may even be appalled by his antics. If so, the time to speak up is long overdue. Otherwise their continued silence can be taken as acquiescence in the total extinction of moderate Conservatism as a force in British politics.Explore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionImmigration and asylumKemi BadenochRobert JenrickLabourNigel FarageeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromJude Anderson,Dr Nick WilliamsandJean AustinThu 21 Aug 2025 12.31 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 21.31 EDTShareSimon Jenkins claims that students at university face an “academic experience that has almost nothing to do with real life” (As thousands more teenagers scramble for university places, I have to ask – why?, 14 August).I would invite him to join my journalism sessions at the University of Northampton, where he would need to finish the day with a radio or TV package plus social media content, as well as his written piece for the paper and online. Today’s student journalists need to produce far more varied content than when he was an editor.His idea of cramming all that learning into two years is nonsense. Most students need a year to learn how to manage their lives and studies. And, more importantly, a two-year degree would mean teaching all year around, and only very privileged students have the luxury of not working in the holidays (as well as in termtime) to pay the bills.Universities have changed a lot since the days of the people who comment on them in Westminster or Fleet Street. In some ways, they are in their ivory towers and we lecturers operate in the real world.Adrian WarnerSenior lecturerin multimedia sports journalism, University of NorthamptonSo much of Simon Jenkins’ article struck chords. I went to university when I was 27, didn’t pay anything, and it changed my life. I hated secondary school in the 1960s and couldn’t wait to leave, which I did at 17 with no A-levels. I was bored and just wanted to leave home and be independent. So I trained as a nurse in the paid, apprentice-type course that pertained. It was then that I realised my potential, so I went back to college.Nowadays, my route through further education and university as an adult would be prohibitively expensive for many people, whereas I had an undergraduate grant from the local authority, followed by a research scholarship. And I realised that higher education is not about earning a higher salary, but learning about a wider world, even if you don’t end up at the destination you intended.Perhaps every citizen should have a voucher to use for a university opportunity at a time they choose and the age that suits them – anywhere between leaving school and entering retirement. That would avoid the teenage scramble and contribute to wider access to higher education for those who seek it.Jude AndersonCardiffSimon Jenkins makes pertinent points regarding the changing nature of British universities. I lectured at one of Scotland’s ancient universities for 24 years until I resigned in 2000 because of falling academic standards.The final straw was being asked to teach tutorial groups of 20 students (when I was an undergraduate in the late 1960s, the tutorial size was four). Rapid expansion of student numbers from 1997 onwards hoovered up the less able middle class, but did little to attract the gifted working class.The award of first- and upper second-class degrees to maintain institutional attractiveness has increased at the same time as student abilities and teaching quality have fallen. British universities are now commercial degree factories, with no vision or wider purpose other than survival in a market.Dr Nick WilliamsAuchenblae, AberdeenshireI do agree with Simon Jenkins about the emphasis on university courses in this country. When I left school in 1960, university was an option only for the very few, even for grammar school pupils like me. However, I began work as a trainee librarian and studied via day-release and evening classes, all paid for by the local authority, to complete my degree-level qualification. I was earning at the same time and gaining hands-on experience.When I wanted to return to work after raising a family I took an Open University degree, gaining friends and lots of experience as well as a degree to update my professional qualifications – again, paid for by part-time work.I now have concerns for my eldest grandson, who wants, very sensibly, to take an apprenticeship, as I hear that companies are cutting back on employees and are not often looking at taking on apprentices.Jean AustinCrawley, West SussexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

First, she has endorsed yet another prison-building programme, a policy that has failed so dismally for the past 200 years. If the answer to the current crisis is more prisons, then she, like her predecessors, is asking the wrong question.Second, she has said prisons should be regarded as being of“national importance”. Why should they be seen as more important than developing welfare-oriented, radical alternatives to custody, or abolishing the structural inequalities that are central to who is criminalised and imprisoned?Third, the profile mentions that her plans include chemical castration for sex offenders. There are significant human rights issues concerning this policy. It is also a short-term expedient and does not address the widespread, systemic nature of violence against women and girls, including sexual violence. And she has approved using pepper spray to incapacitate children in young offenderinstitutions.Finally, she has “taken inspiration” from claims that Texas has reduced its prison population. The reasons for this are more complicated than the profilerecognises. Furthermore, prisoners in solitary confinement are held in cages smaller than telephone booths and have no toilet orsink. There were over 14,000 deaths in state custody in Texas between 2005 and 2024, disproportionately involving Hispanic and Black people, with over 11,000 occurring inpenal institutions.Deborah ColesExecutive director, Inquest,Joe SimEmeritus professor, school of justice studies, Liverpool John Moores University,Steve TombsEmeritus professor, The Open UniversityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromHamish MonkThu 21 Aug 2025 12.31 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe Mercator projection is not a product of European chauvinism (African Union joins calls to end use of Mercator map that shrinks continent’s size, 15 August). All map projections are compromises geared to a particular use, as a direct transference of a sphere on to a flat surface is mathematically impossible. The Mercator projection was a brilliant solution to a critical need of 16th-century pilots: a map on which they could plot a straight line that would be a “straight” line on the Earth.A mathematical marvel first put to paper byGerard Mercator in 1569, it was not until 30 years later that the English mathematician Edward Wright sufficiently solved the complexities to make it practical. The Equal Earth map promoted by the African Union, like all others, simply makes different compromises for a different purpose. The African Union could well argue that the venerable Mercator projection is not the ideal choice for everyday use, but the notion that it marginalises Africa is a pointless distraction from real issues. European civilisation is guilty of centuries of crimes against the global south, but the Mercator projection is not one of them.Thomas SuárezLondonYour article doesn’t acknowledge that the surface of a sphere cannot be represented on a plane without distortion. This was proved mathematically byCarl Friedrich Gaussin the early 1800s. A raft of algorithms must be chosen from to translate what we see on the surface of the Earth into a two-dimensional map. This process is known as projection, and there are numerous techniques; each affects how a map ultimately looks. Every projection comes with trade-offs in shape, distance, direction, and land area.The 16th-century Mercator projection preserves the shape of land masses (which is why it is so commonly used in schools) as well as direction (which is why it is used by navigators and Google Maps). What the Mercator projection sacrifices, however, is size representation, which is most distorted at the poles – meaningAfricais rendered smaller than it really is.The Gall-Peters projection, meanwhile, nigh-on perfectly preserves land size, but heavily distorts shape. With the dawn of satellites and GPS, the Mercator projection has fallen from favour because it is no longer needed to aid navigation. Modern cartographers are free to blend equal-area maps, such as the Gall-Peters, with shape-preserving projections, such as the Mercator – and split a difference between size and shape. But there is no “correct” map projection, and the idea that the Mercator projection is symptomatic of European imperialism is a modern critique. The fairest way to see the Earth is to study a globe.Hamish MonkChelmsford, EssexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Then came ‘shrinking girl summer’ – is everyone getting smaller except me?, 10 August), I would like to add a personal view. My lovely mom was overweight all of her adult life – between 17 stone and 18 stone. She could never run around and play with us children. In her 40s she developed diabetes and high blood pressure. Many DVTs and pulmonary embolisms followed. She died of a coronary aged 62.We should all live without fear of stigma and ridicule. This doesn’t mean that we should make choices that shorten our lives or encourage others to do so. Being overweight brings health risks. Blaming the patriarchy, fatphobia or big pharma doesn’t reduce those risks.My lovely dad – who was never overweight – died at the age of 93. In my mind, I lost a third of the time I might have had with my mom, a loss I put squarely down to obesity. I worry increasingly for our young people – men and women – where being overweight is becoming normalised.Sadly, in my small town in south-west England, the idea that “everyone is getting smaller” is demonstrably untrue.Frances KnightDevonExplore more on these topicsObesityBody imageHealthDiabeteslettersShareReuse this content"

Back in 1991, the men who were in charge of the sport did not just refuse to sanction the new women’s competition, they made legal threats against the four organisers, who had to design their own team and tournament logos to avoid a copyright lawsuit.The women approached more than 600 businesses for support, but could not persuade one to sign on so the 12 teams had to cover the cost of their own transport, food and accommodation. The Russian team did it by trading the booze they had brought over with them.Red Roses pick up where Lionesses left off in England women’s great sporting summerRead moreSport, and society, has changed so much since the first tournament that the 10th, which begins whenEngland play the USA at the Stadium of Lighton Friday night, feels almost unrecognisable from the first. The opening match is a reprise of the first final, when the USA beat England 19-6 in front of a crowd of 3,000 at Cardiff Arms Park.By the fifth final, England v New Zealand in Edmonton in 2006, the crowd had doubled to 6,000. By the sixth, which was the last to be held in England, it had doubled again, with 13,000 coming to watch England lose to New Zealand at the Stoop. This year’s match will be at Twickenham,in front of a full house of 82,000.The life of the World Cup can be counted in a few years, but its growth has to be measured in hundreds, thousands and millions. It feels like proof of progress. It is one little corner of the world where things really are getting better. In the space of a generation the sport has become more equitable, open-minded and inclusive, its leaders more supportive and the society around it open to the possibility that there are myriad ways to be a woman.Rugby resonates.

They are more likely to be drawn in by seeing the clips or matches on streaming services, by the players sharing their own stories on social media and the reciprocal link between brands they love and the sponsored athletes they admire.It is the women who are going to provide the game’s growth over the next decade. World Rugby used to shun this competition, but now it is at the front and centre of its global development strategy. The organisers have already sold 375,000 tickets, more than double the number who attended the last tournament in New Zealand three years ago.More than 500 journalists are accredited to attend, which is five times the number they had then.

Today, World Rugby is paying for the teams with the furthest to travel to fly in business class. Where the women used to play in borrowed kit, now they have their own individual training bases and teams of specialist coaches.They need to do more. The sport has accelerated so quickly that it is experiencing growing pains. The professionals are underpaid, while the gap between the top teams and everyone else is too big and has been exacerbated by professionalisation.Raffle tickets to record gates: The story of every Women’s Rugby World Cup final – in picturesRead moreThe competition director, Yvonne Nolan, says thatthese teams are “on various stages of their journey”and despite World Rugby providing the semi-pro teams with access to specialist coaching before the tournament there will be some very one-sided scorelines. The flip side of which is that the top teams, such as England, have not had a whole lot of experience of being under the pressure of close competition.There is a risk, too, that professionalisation, and commercialisation, will have a deadening effect on the very things that make the game so appealing, in the same way many would say it has for the men’s version. But if there are one or two reasons to worry, there are a lot more to feel cheerful. Because something is happening here and if you are one of those people who does not know what it is, you are missing out.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025Women's rugby unionRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The club’s position is straightforward: there are no suitable defenders on the market and, in any case, it is up to Maresca to find internal solutions. The Italian can call upon Josh Acheampong, who performed well against Crystal Palace on the opening weekend. The 19-year-old started with Colwill’s long-term absence complicated by Tosin Adarabioyo’s minor injury. Adarabioyo may return for Friday night at West Ham but there is a case to give Acheampong another chance next to Trevoh Chalobah. Acheampong, who counts Manchester City as one of his many suitors, stood up to Jean-Phillipe Mateta in thegoalless draw with Palace. It is worth having another look at whether he can cope as the central centre-back when Chelsea morph into a back three in possession. Replacing Colwill’s line-breaking passes will not be easy but Maresca has options.Jacob SteinbergWest Ham v Chelsea, Friday 8pm (all times BST)Spurs must put Eze behind themView image in fullscreenEberechi Eze ultimately preferred Arsenal over Tottenham.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesTottenham ride into the Etihad Stadium in the wake of the Eberechi Eze farrago. Perhaps Thomas Frank can use the crimson embarrassment of Arsenal gazumping his club for the Crystal Palace forward’s signature to inspire his men. Last November, under Ange Postecoglou, Spurs trounced Pep Guardiola’s champions 4-0. A repeat may seem unlikely given Eze’s morale-sapping choice plus Manchester City’s4-0 opening-day victory at Wolves. However, Frank and his players’ job is to be able to show fight and spirit and tenacity precisely when it is difficult. So at lunchtime on Saturday, we will find out how much of these qualities they possess.Jamie JacksonManchester City v Tottenham, Saturday 12.30pmBrentford look to Damsgaard for inspirationThings started appallingly for Keith Andrews in his new life as Brentford head coach. In the first 45 minutes of his senior managerial career, the Bees showed no identity to makelife easy for Nottingham Forest. Clearly, the lack of Yoane Wissa and the failure to replace Bryan Mbeumo will cause problems but a key absence in the East Midlands was Mikkel Damsgaard, missing after his wife gave birth. Andrews spoke of his importance to the team; unsurprising because he won of the players’ and fans’ player of the year award last season. The Dane’s return to the midfield will be imperative because Elliot Anderson and Morgan Gibbs-White dominated proceedings, unthreatened by anything akin to pressing. Alongside Damsgaard, Jordan Henderson may start after coming off the bench for his debut on Sunday. Experience will be helpful to Andrews, because he lacks it as a coach. Brentford were certainly better in the second half at Forest and the greater assurance of Damsgaard and Henderson can help their colleagues settle and forget that poor start.Will UnwinBrentford vAston Villa, Saturday 3pmBurnley need a goal threatThis feels like a game Burnley need to win already. The Clarets conceded almost a third of the entire tally of their goals-against column last seasonat Tottenham last weekend. Burnley were always going to be more porous at the back by the nature of stepping into the Premier League but on that basis, they need to find goals at the other end. Last season’s top scorer Josh Brownhill has departed and replacing his threat will be difficult. Lyle Foster started as the main striker at Spurs that was a struggle for Burnley, manageing just four shots on target. Armando Broja is waiting in the wings but needs to work on his physical condition before he can be considered for selection, understandable after his history of injury problems. A lot of pressure is placed on the Albania striker’s shoulders in the medium to long term but there is an immediate issue this weekend. If Scott Parker does not find goals, it could set the tone for what is to come.WUBurnley v Sunderland, Saturday 3pmCherries moving beyond summer exodusBournemouth’s season is never going to hinge on results at the best teams in the division but anopening-day defeat at Anfieldoffered plenty of positives. A typically buccaneering performance by Andoni Iraola’s side suggested a summer of change has not been as damaging as perhaps feared. Adrien Truffert, the left-back signed from Rennes, was particularly impressive and they have since augmented their squad with addition of Amine Adli, who was part of Xabi Alonso’s double-winning Bayer Leverkusen side in 2023-24. Ben Gannon Doak – who wishes to reflect both of his parents’ names – is another exciting arrival before hosting Wolves. Last week Dango Ouattara became the latest player to exit, for Brentford, in a deal worth up to £42.5m. A buzz does not breed guarantees but Bournemouth appear to have taken the summer exodus in their stride.Ben FisherBournemouth v Wolves, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenAdrien Truffert impressed against the defending champions in Bournemouth’s opening game of the season.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty ImagesMerino set for emergency roleAmid all the excitement aboutEberechi Eze’s impending arrival at Arsenal, spare a thought for Mikel Merino. The Spain midfielder’s prospects in his favoured position already looked bleak after the signing of compatriot Martín Zubimendi meant he started the season on the bench after spending the second half of the previous campaign filling in as a makeshift No 9. The knee injury suffered by Kai Havertz means Merino could find himself back in that position over the next few weeks given that he is the only other player in Mikel Arteta’s squad capable of replacing Viktor Gyökeres through the middle. Eze is expected to compete with Gabriel Martinelli on the left-hand side of Arsenal’s attack but can also play in midfield. The new man is unlikely to be available to face Leedsbut Merino could have an important role to play.Ed AaronsArsenal v Leeds, Saturday 5.30pmNew home, familiar Everton problemsIt is the dawn of a new era for Everton as the £800m Hill Dickinson Stadium hosts its first competitive game and 52,769 fans adapt to plush modern surroundings. There will be pre-match events to mark the occasion, a special edition programme priced £10 and wide-eyed astonishment at the complete lack of obstructed views. It is a momentous day for the club and the city but Everton will be trying to tread a fine line between celebrating their new home while ensuring the focus remains on, and the fervour behind, David Moyes’s team.Monday’s performance at Leedswas chastening for those Evertonians who had approached the new campaign with unusual optimism. Perhaps not for the Everton manager who has spent all summer calling for more improvements to his squad. Everton were fortunate to lose their opening home game of last season 3-0 against Brighton, such was the second half dominance of Fabian Hürzeler’s side, and soon lost the positive momentum they had built up in the final weeks of the previous campaign. Everton require a fresh start all round.Andy HunterEverton v Brighton, Sunday 2pmGlasner short on personnel for PalaceWe are only a week into the new season but Oliver Glasner already has concerns about a lack of squad depth at Crystal Palace. The expected departure of Eberechi Eze means Palace must act quickly to find a replacement, with Leicester’s Bilal El Khannouss and Tyler Dibling of Southampton among those considered. In the meantime, a knee injury to Daichi Kamada – who often played further forward under Glasner at Eintracht Frankfurt – could rule him out of the grudge match with Nottingham Forest on Sunday, meaning that Palace may turn toCommunity Shield penalty shootout heroJustin Devenny. The 21-year-old Northern Irishman signed from Airdrieonians in 2023, just four Premier League starts last season has very big boots to fill.EACrystal Palace vNottingham Forest, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenCrystal Palace may be forced to turn to Justin Devenny this weekend.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Nigel French/Apl/SportsphotoMount or Sesko is Amorim’s choiceFlashes of positivity for Manchester United during theirdefeat by Arsenalare all well and good but Ruben Amorim could do with improved results. United must also improve in both boxes. Will Amorim tweaks his attack on Sunday. Does Mason Mount continue as a false No 9 or is Benjamin Sesko ready to lead the line from the start? There was a feeling United were not quite as effective after Mount went off against Arsenal. He has endured a wretched few years but is a useful, influential team player when on form with the ability to create space for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Still, Sesko has not been signed to sit on the bench. The gargantuan Slovenian is a handful for anyone while a team who have struggled for goals under Amorim could do with a finisher in the starting XI.JSFulham vManchester United, Sunday 4.30pmIsak wrangle will stoke fires at St James’Matches involving Newcastle and Liverpool often contain a bit of an edge but this rerun oflast season’s Carabao Cup finalwill surely take things to a different level. Eddie Howe’s team won that showpiece yet one of their heroes of the hour, Alexander Isak, is at war with Newcastle as he endeavours to, currently rather forlornly, engineer a move to Anfield. With the Sweden striker training alone the only certainty is that Isak will not be at St James’ Park where geordie anger at Liverpool’s perceived tactics in unsettling Tyneside’s fallen idol should guarantee already febrile emotions run high. Howe is expected to field the former Everton winger, and boyhood Liverpool fan, Anthony Gordon out of position at centre-forward. Gordon, along with Isak and Fabian Schär, scored in last December’s fabulous 3-3 Premier League draw between these teams. Back then Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah scored twice in the course of a wonderful performance. The Egyptian’s duel with Howe’s likely left-back, Tino Livramento, could prove pivotal.Louise TaylorNewcastle vLiverpool, Monday 8pmExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendArsenalAston VillaBrentfordBournemouthBrighton & Hove AlbionCrystal PalacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or, at least, when it became public knowledge. And it was the prompt for two things to happen.Firstly, it would be reported a few days later thatArsenalwere also on the case. The club’s new sporting director, Andrea Berta, had put the feelers out for the Crystal Palace forward. Call it a declaration of interest, albeit Berta was having a lot of conversations about a lot of potential targets at the time. His idea was to have plenty of options on the boil before deciding which to prioritise.‘Lads, it’s Tottenham’: missing out on Eze just the latest banana skin | Rob DaviesRead moreThen, there was a subtle change to the mood music at Spurs, a kind of step back into a holding pattern. Agent talk, was the word inside the club. Eze was more likely to stay at Palace. It would be wrong to get too far ahead of anything on this one. But it was impossible to ignore the alternative reading: Spurs did not want to be drawn into a battle with their rivals over one of the most exciting talents on the market.Spurs were fearful of that, and for good reason. They had to know that, given the choice, Eze would go for Arsenal over them. There were the emotional reasons. He had supported Arsenal as a kid and played in their academy until his release as a 13-year-old; the line about how he cried for a week afterwards is a well-known part of his story. Yet it would not only be about dreams and unfinished business. Eze would surely look at the Premier League table from last season. At which club would he stand the better chance of winning the title?At this point it is worth introducing Mikel Arteta, who let it be known just how highly he rated Eze and how perfectly he would fit into his team. Eze’s head was turned. So Spurs entered territory in which the reward was tantalising, almost irresistible, but the risk was extreme. It was as if they were shadow boxing with Arsenal, their every move over Eze likely to come right back at them. Arsenal were a devil on their shoulder; watching, waiting.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze spent five years with Crystal Palace.Photograph: John Walton/PASpurs would pivot to Morgan Gibbs-White in July only to run into the immovable object that is Evangelos Marinakis. No deal, the Nottingham Forest owner said. There would be a new one for Gibbs-White at Forest and, sadly for Spurs,egg on their faceafter they believed they would be able to exploit a £60m release clause in his old contract.The Gibbs-White episode has been a climate-shaper in Spurs’s summer and then there was the moment whenJames Maddison ruptured his anterior cruciate ligamentin the pre-season game against Newcastle on 3 August; a shattering blow for him and Spurs.Dejan Kulusevski, the club’s other key central attacking midfielder, had knee surgery in May and is out until around the turn of the year, so the need to act in the market was obvious and urgent. Why not move straight away for Eze; give him and Palace a decision to make by meeting the £68m release clause in his deal, which was in place until 15 August?Spurs’s hesitation was to do with the fact they considered the number to be too high for a 27-year-old with 12 England caps and no experience of European football at club level. It is not the only detail in terms of optics that has hurt them as Arsenal prepare to pay pretty much that amount to take Eze to the Emirates, with Spurs themselves having ended up ready to do likewise.There has been the idea that Spurs had a clear run at Eze because Arsenal, after spending around £200m on six other signings, would need to raise money via sales before they could make a bid. Well, they have sold nobody and still pushed the button. Unless Arsenal have a sale or two lined up, could it be that they have more financial headroom than they have let on?View image in fullscreenTottenham also missed out on Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White.Photograph: Shaun Brooks/CameraSport/Getty ImagesIt is easy to pick over the curiosities. Eze is represented by CAA Base, the influential firm of agents who have close links to Spurs. Should that have given Spurs an edge? It must be said that Base will always put the wishes of their players first. And why did it seemingly take Kai Havertz feeling a knee injury afterSunday’s win at Manchester Unitedfor Arsenal to move on Eze? There are similarities in the profile of both players but there is a fundamental difference: Havertz can play as a No 9, Eze cannot. With Gabriel Jesus a long-term injury casualty, the loss of Havertz ought to have led Arsenal to look for a No 9 to provide support for the new signing, Viktor Gyökeres. Not take Eze.The great teams Crystal Palace can follow in their first season in EuropeRead moreThe reality is that Spurs were never going to win this fight. We will never know what would have happened if they had offered to pay Eze’s release clause. But it feels fair to assume that it would have led Arsenal into following suit. Spurs eventually reached an agreement with Palace on Wednesday and they believed they had one with Eze, too.If Arsenal were not an option, Eze would have joined Spurs. At this stage of his career, after giving everything for Palace across five seasons, he is ready for a change; the chance to play in the Champions League. But Arsenal were an option; they never went away. It took them a matter of hours to slide in for the steal. The bad news for Spurs is that the very thing they feared has come to pass. The memes are out, an Eze mural has appeared in the tunnel outside the Emirates and the time is tighter to provide Frank with a new No 10.Have Spurs built on the momentum of their Europa League triumph from last season? They have added João Paulinha and Mohammed Kudus for the starting XI, while it was a tonic to tie the new captain, Cristian Romero, to a long-term contract. But when their supporters look around, they see that Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal have spent £200m or significantly upwards on signings. Manchester City, meanwhile, have invested £150m. The mood at Tottenham is back to being edgy. Arsenal have made a statement of intent.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurArsenalanalysisShareReuse this content"

However, she could face the in-form 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova, a recent semi-finalist at the Cincinnati Open, in round two. A potential third-round opponent is a resurgent Elena Rybakina, the2022 Wimbledon championandanother semi-finalist in Cincinnati last week.US Open women’s singles: how the top players are shaping up for Flushing MeadowsRead moreLast year markeda low point for Raducanu as she lost in the first roundafter missing most of the US hard-court swing. This time, she is as match-tough as she has been over the past few years, establishing a consistently high level over the past few months and pushing Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, to a final-set tie-break intheir three-hour ­tussle in Cincinnati. Now ranked No 35, Raducanu missed out on being seeded in New York by just one spot.In his return to singles competition, after missing the entire US hardcourt swing, Raducanu’s fellow British player Jack Draper will also face a qualifier or lucky loser in his opening-round match. Draper, seeded fifth, has not competed in singles since Wimbledon after being diagnosed with a left forearm injury.

Rybakina, who she could meet in the quarter-finals, is the most dangerous player in her section before the semi-finals and Pegula, the fourth seed, is the second-highest seed in the top half.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner had to retire from the final in Cincinnati on Monday but was practising in New York on Thursday.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesCoco Gauff, the third seed, has been drawn in No 2-seeded Iga Swiatek’s half of the draw as she tries to find her way again after a difficult period since herFrench Open win in June.

They will going into that fixture on the back of a busy summer, securing Chloe Kelly on a permanent deal following her successful loan spell from Manchester City last season, adding goalkeeper Anneke Borbe from Wolfsburg and signing Liverpool duo Taylor Hinds, a former academy player, and forward Olivia Smith.Smith joined the club for a world-record fee in July, becoming the first £1m-player in women’s football and she praised the confidence placed in her potential. “It’s such a hefty price tag for such a young player,” said Smith. “I think they see the potential that I have. They see my mindset. I’m hungry, I’m driven, I want to learn, I want to grow, and I want to win things, ultimately. I think that was a big piece. The money? it’s not really a big deal for me.“At the end of the day, the price tag’s a price tag, it’s not really something I’m focused on, I’m just focused on being on the pitch and learning from a great set of players. It’s also great to see the development of women’s football and that price going up.”Smith was “on the edge of my seat” watching Arsenal’sChampions League win in May. “It was quite stressful for me, and I wasn’t even on the pitch,” she said. “It was an amazing performance by the girls, and watching it on a screen you could just see the motivation, the drive and the hunger and I knew that was something that I wanted to be a part of. That was also a massive driving factor in me joining, just looking at their mentality and what they’ve achieved in the Champions League.”Hinds, like Kelly, developed in Arsenal’s academy before leaving for her next opportunity.

The Tottenham attacking midfielder underwent knee surgery in mid-May and, although the injury was serious, the extent of the lay-off he faces has until now been unclear.Losing the Sweden international, who scored 10 goals and provided 11 assists in 50 appearances for Spurs last season, is another headache for Thomas Frank, who is digesting the club beinggazumped by Arsenal for the £67.5m signature of Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze. The manager’s other key attacking midfielder, James Maddison, is a long-term casualty afterrupturing his anterior cruciate ligamentagainst Newcastle in pre-season.The pressure is on Spurs to respond to missing out on Eze with a statement signing after the failure earlier in the summer to sign Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White. They thought they had the midfielder after moving on a £60m buyout clause in his contract only for the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, to refuse to sanction the deal.Spurs have shown an interest in the Manchester City winger Savinho, although City maintain they want to keep the Brazilian. Spurs play at City on Saturday lunchtime. Whether their opponents soften their stance after the game remains to be seen.Spurs have made inquiries about Monaco’s Maghnes Akliouche. The France Under-21 international, who has burnished his reputation after two impressive seasons at Monaco, can play on the wing or through the middle. Frank is also open to signing Yoane Wissa from his former club Brentford and retains an interest in the Southampton winger Tyler Dibling, while Como’s Nico Paz is another option.Spurs have been relatively quiet so far in the transfer window. In terms of new faces, they have added Mohammed Kudus, João Paulinha, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

Events at the final hole of the ­opening round of the Tour Championship barely compared with what played outat Augusta National in Aprilbut these were still moments of ­McIlroy box office. No wonder he stood ­laughing with arm aloft.McIlroy found himself in a ­greenside bunker in two at the par-five 18th. He caught his attempt from the sand trap far too cleanly, the ball ­flying over the flag and rebounding from a grandstand. The bounce was favourable; McIlroy had 17ft left for a birdie. The putt found the bottom of the cup, much to the amusement of McIlroy and his playing partner ­Scottie ­Scheffler. McIlroy’s 66 at East Lake leaves him five shy of the first-round lead after Russell Henley’s stunning 61.Tiger Woods takes up PGA role but unification in golf is as distant as ever | Ewan MurrayRead moreThis was a fine day for Keegan ­Bradley, were he not in the midst of the toughest choice of his professional career. Henley will play under ­Bradley for the United States in the Ryder Cup next month. Scheffler continued his excellent form with a 63, including a back half of just 31. The 64s of ­Patrick Cantlay, Collin Morikawa and Justin Thomas were notable with that trio likely to receive captain’s picks from Bradley. The key dilemma surrounds whether Bradley is also going to select himself, thereby becoming the first playing captain in a Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer in 1963.Bradley’s 70 here hardly added to the conversation. The 39-year-old did not hang around for media duties. Significant in this debate is what Bradley’s peers will tell him to do. The mood music ­suggests they want Bradley on this team. “Yeah, I would,” said Thomas when asked whether he would pick Bradley. “It is a lot [to handle both jobs]. I think Keegan would say the same. I don’t think he would say it’s easy by any means. But myself, whatever other [vice-]captains, automatic qualifiers have all the faith in the world that whatever he decides to do is going to be in the best interest of the team.”Morikawa outlined the trickiness of the scenario: “I think he’s got one of the most difficult decisions ­anyone has ever had to make. He has put more hours than we could even ask and know about into this Ryder Cup and he still has played great golf. He is one of the best Americans as of right now. But I truly do not know where his head sits and I don’t want to be in that position.View image in fullscreenTommy Fleetwood continuted his good form with a 64 at East Lake to be tied third after the first round of the Tour Championship.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA“If you lose, every reason is going to come up. At the end of the day, we lost in Rome because we played bad golf and they played great golf. That’s what it comes down to.”There are European colours on the leaderboard.

Tiger Woods will chair the group. “Tiger asked me to be on the committee, so I said yes,” said Cantlay when asked his reasoning for being involved.

For clarity, teams very rarely defeat Hull KR: this is only the fourth time they have tasted defeat in 2025 and two of them have been by the Rhinos. It is also the first time they have lost by 20 points or more in almost 18 months.This was not just a victory for Brad Arthur’s side. It was a statement that Super League title No 9 may not be too far away for a team who are rejuvenated under the guidance of the Australian. Back-to-back eighth-placed finishes in 2023 and 2024 seem a distant past; this is now a side capable of going the distance this autumn.RFL under pressure to produce rugby league action plan to avoid funding cutsRead moreFor 80 minutes here, Headingley felt like the good old days when league titles were more of a formality than they were a possibility. With a raucous crowd behind them and Leeds playing a wonderful brand of rugby, they blew the Super League leaders away from start to finish.In doing so, they breathed new life into their push for a place in the top two come the playoffs. The League Leaders’ Shield is doubtless heading toHull KR, but second place is now firmly up for grabs, with Leeds level on points with Wigan with four rounds remaining – and that brings with it huge positives come the playoffs.The top two get a bye through the opening round of the play-offs and a home semi-final too. All of a sudden, few would back against Leeds. Leading 18-0 at half-time thanks to tries from Jake Connor, Presley Cassell and Lachie Miller, there was never much chance of a Rovers comeback on an off-night for them, but a stellar one for Leeds.“I feel like it’s been building towards that,” Arthur said following their best performance of 2025. Miller was at the heart of everything they did well, laying on a try for Connor before Cassell, the latest product of their fine academy, surged through to make it 12-0.Miller then rounded the Hull KR defence to make it 18-0 long before the half-hour mark. Having delivered a wonderful display at the reigning champions, Wigan Warriors, last week, this was perhaps an understandably low-key evening for Rovers. But the standards they have set in recent years means this will be a difficult night to review.“It wasn’t a good performance or result,” their coach, Willie Peters, said. “They had more aggression and intent, and they strolled through us.” Any notion of a Hull KR comeback had to come through an early try after half-time to breathe life into the contest, but Leeds’ defensive efforts meant that felt unlikely.View image in fullscreenLachlan Miller scored Leeds’ third try against Hull KR to help them to an 18-0 lead.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThere were half-chances, but the Rhinos always felt in control of proceedings. Connor’s penalty to make it a four-score lead only emphasised that further before another scintillating attacking move led to Harry Newman scoring their fourth try of the night.Another penalty from the boot of Connor as Rovers continued to toil then made it 28-0 and at that stage, the prospect of Hull KR being beaten to nil for the first time since May 2022 appeared to be on the cards. They at least avoided that ignominy when Tom Davies crossed in the corner with five minutes left, but the damage had long since been done and the statement long since been made.Perhaps it was fitting Leeds delivered a performance like this here too, on the night when the late, great Rob Burrow’s family were in attendance. How he would have absolutely loved his beloved Rhinos producing something quite as emphatic as this.Explore more on these topicsRugby leagueLeeds RhinosHull KRSuper LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

She does everything right, she gets the mile and a half well but she could probably come back [in trip], and she seems to handle slow ground and quick ground. She’s professional and does everything nicely and she has plenty of options.”The most obvious possibilities are one or both of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in early October and the Breeders’ Cup Turf at Del Mar a month later, though Whirl is also a leading candidate for the same events.“We’ve always felt the better the race, the better she’ll be,” O’Brien said. “She’s won well in the end, our filly, she obviously stays very well and always finishes her race off well. She doesn’t kill herself getting there but she’s always finishing.“She has to be close to the top of our pecking order for the Arc, she’s an improving filly at this time of year. She could go to the Breeders’ Cup Turf but also the Arc [and] Whirl could go with her.”Fillies continue to dominate the Arc betting after Thursday’s race, with Andrew Balding’s Kalpana, the King George runner-up, narrowly favoured at around 7-1, with Whirl and Minnie Hauk at 9-1 and 10-1 respectively.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Friday tipsShowNewmarket12.50 Rajaking 1.20 Ten Pounds 2.00 Enchanted Queen 2.35 Monoceros 3.10 Angel Shared 3.45 Huggable 4.20 VenezuelanYork1.50 French Duke (nb) 2.25 Trawlerman 3.00 Lifeplan 3.35 She’s Quality (nap) 4.10 Zgharta 4.45 Naval Light 4.45 Sea ForceFfos Las2.10 Navid 2.45 Lost Signal 3.20 Cypriot Diaspora 3.55 Step Along 4.30 The Pug 5.00 Sea Of CharmHamilton5.05 August George 5.35 Seren Star 6.05 Tiernan 6.35 Defiance 7.05 Naana’s Sparkle 7.35 The Good Biscuit 8.05 Global EffortGoodwood5.15 Joycean Way 5.48 Coconut Cove 6.18 Noche Clasica 6.48 Eternal Blessing 7.18 On Edge 7.48 Kiss And RunWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Friday tips: A Quality pick in NunthorpeTen juveniles have tried and failed to take advantage of the weight concession from their older rivals since Kingsgate Native’s success in the Nunthorpe Stakes in 2007, but that has not deterred the connections of Lady Iman and Spicy Marg, who will face 15 rivals in the feature race on day three of York’s Ebor Festival.Both are fillies and so get the maximum allowance, with just 8st 2lb to carry, and Lady Iman, unbeaten at the five-furlong trip, is the narrow favourite at around 5-1 in the early betting for what is an exceptionally open renewal of the meeting’s big sprint.View image in fullscreenShe’s Quality (right) can atone for a narrow Goodwood defeat by Jm Jungle when they meet again in the Nunthorpe at York.Photograph: Ian Headington/racingfotos.com/ShutterstockIn all, a dozen of the 17 runners are priced up at between 5-1 and 20-1, for a race that has had winners at 100-1, 40-1 twice and 28-1 over the last 15 years.Timeform’sratings confirm that there is very little to choose between the majority of the field, and that while Lady Iman undoubtedly has more scope for improvement than most of her rivals, she still has something to find with several runners at bigger odds.Solid alternatives include Jm Jungle, who has excellent track form and put up a career best to win the Group Two King George Stakes at Goodwood last time, but fillies and mares have a fine record in the Nunthorpe in recent years and York is also likely to play to the strengths of the runner-up there,She’s Quality(3.35).Jack Davison’s filly has been second on all four of her starts this season, and showed impressive speed to lead until well inside the final furlong in the Charge at Sandown on Eclipse day. She should see things out better on the Knavesmire and is an interesting bet at around 10-1 to give her a trainer a first Group One success.York 1.50French Dukehas struggled to get involved from tricky draws at Ascot and Goodwood on his last two starts, but deserves one more chance to rediscover his promising three-year-old form in a smaller field, and at a track that gives his rider more room for manoeuvre.York 2.25John and Thady Gosden’sTrawlermanestablished himself as the leading stayer in Britain with a seven-length success in the Ascot Gold Cup last time and a 3lb penalty for that win is unlikely to prevent him following up.York 3.00This is not the strongest renewal of the Gimcrack by any stretch and the likely favourite, Do Or Do Not, is still a maiden after five starts, so the way could be open for the once-racedLifeplanto follow up his cosy debut success at Thirsk in July.York 4.10Zghartahad no luck at all in running at Goodwood last time and will be strongly fancied to make amends off the same mark.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

There was no further word on his condition, but he was released from the hospital and taken to jail after just a few hours.He has since been booked on suspicion of misdemeanour for obstructing an officer and was being held at Valley jail in Van Nuys, near where the police found him.Lil Nas X gained fame after his track Old Town Road became a record-breaking No 1 hit, staying there for 19 weeks. He also had success with songs including Industry Baby and Montero (Call Me By Your Name).He is set to release his album Dreamboy later this year after releasing a number of singles this spring, and in the last week, returned to social media with a series of posts featuring snippets of new music.

If it wasn’t first past the post then you can see how a new party could come through, but I understand why he did it.”Abbott describedZarah Sultana, the independent MP launching the new party with Corbyn, as a “lovely person who is full of energy”. She said the party could get votes and support from people who were “not necessarily leftwing” but were “disappointed about the way [Labour has] gone in the past year”.Abbott, who as the longest-serving female MP has the honorary title of mother of the house,is suspended by Labour. Shelost the party whip in April 2023after she wrote a letter to the Observer in which she argued that Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experienced prejudice but not racism, and likened their experience to that of people with red hair.She said the letter published was a draft version and that her comments had been taken out of context. She wasreadmitted to the party in time to hold her seat at the general election. But she was suspended again last month after telling the BBC in an interview that she did not regret the remarks.Abbott said in Edinburgh: “I think she and Jeremy are a great combination but at this point in time, it’s difficult to see how a brand new party wins. However, I think Jeremy’s party is going to do a lot better than people think, because a lot of people are not necessarily terribly leftwing. People are a tiny bit disappointed about the way we’ve gone in the past year.”Asked whether she thought she would ever be accepted at the heart of the Labour party, Abbott said: “I think I am at the heart of the Labour party, it’s other people who aren’t.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But earlier this month, Hinds disputed that account, saying he was forced out and referring to his ex-bandmates as “horrible humans”.Mastodon released their debut album, Remission, in 2002. Their hardcore sound that combined prog-rock, alternative and grunge among other styles quickly caught the attention of heavy metal fans, and their follow-up record, Leviathan, elevated the group to the metal music mainstream.Despite the group’s heavy metal influences, Hinds toldthe Guardianback in 2009 that he felt the band were more classic rock than metal. “That’s the direction I’ve always wanted us to take,” he said. “I never wanted us to be this screaming, lumbering, lotsa-drum-solos band, I always wanted us to be this heavy, psychedelic thing.”Hinds also had a small foray into television when he, along with his former band members, made a brief appearance on the popular HBO series Game of Thrones as “wildings” in the show’s fifth season.Explore more on these topicsMastodonMetalnewsShareReuse this content"

Where concerns were raised in the past and were not acted upon properly, that was a failing of the church. For those institutional failures I offer an unreserved apology.”He said he was deeply sorry for the harm that those assaulted by Brain had suffered, adding that the church was “committed to supporting those affected”.The C of E would order an independent review to examine its “safeguarding responses, culture and processes so that we can identify where lessons can be learned and strengthen best practice for the future”.The trial heard that the Nine O’Clock Service (NOS) had “presented itself to the outside world as a progressive force for good”. But, prosecutors said, NOS became a cult in which Brain abused his position to exert control over the lives of his female followers and ostracise them from friends and family. Some victims told police they felt “brainwashed” by Brain.The NOS was one of the first churches to offer services specifically designed to attract young people, with live music and an atmosphere more akin to a nightclub than traditional worship.It started at St Thomas’s church in Sheffield in 1986 but later moved to a leisure centre to accommodate its growing congregation, which reached up to 600 people.The Church of England celebrated its success, and hoped its innovative model might be replicated in other churches to attract new congregations. The Right Rev David Lunn, the then bishop of Sheffield, told the BBC the NOS was a “new development in the way we understand the Christian religion”.Dazzled by Brain’s apparent star qualities, the C of E fast-tracked his ordination as a priest in 1991. The court heard that “large sums of money” were spent to obtain robes worn by the actor Robert De Niro in the film The Mission for Brain to wear in his ordination ceremony a year later.Young women from the NOS congregation were recruited to a “home base team” dedicated to looking after Brain, his wife and daughter.The group became known among NOS members as the “Lycra lovelies” or the “Lycra nuns” after witnesses reported seeing Brain surrounded by women in lingerie and tight clothing at his home, said Tim Clark KC, prosecuting.The women carried out household chores and some gave the priest massages, the prosecution said.In his evidence, Brain told the jury the massages were intended to relieve “tensions” on his body but could evolve into consensual “sensual touching”. That, he said, was “no big deal”.Brain rejected testimony that he had tried to control people by making them wear the same clothing or lose weight, or that he discouraged them from maintaining friendships.Brain told the court the women’s clothing was “completely normal for that era” and any touching was with “100% consent”. He said the NOS was “more like a group of musicians living together” than a traditional church, and was a “free, open, really caring, very fun environment”.He said in evidence that his “direct Yorkshire style” may have been misinterpreted as controlling and abusive.One woman who had been a member of the NOS under Brain described him as “a predator” who “picked off women he thought were vulnerable”, and that he created a “deeply psychologically abusive” atmosphere designed to keep his victims in line.The NOS collapsed in 1995 after women alleged they had been sexually abused by Brain. The priest admitted “improper sexual conduct with a number of women” and resigned his position. Survivors came forward again in 2021.Richard Scorer, who represented Brain’s victims, said the case “could and should have been prosecuted 30 years ago”.He added: “The C of E must now reckon with its role – this high-control religious cult operated on its watch.”He said there had been “clear warning signs” about Brain which were not acted upon. The C of E’s “failure to act enabled a predator to flourish under the guise of spiritual authority,” he added.Explore more on these topicsCrimeRape and sexual assaultAnglicanismSheffieldEnglandChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

There is already evidence for detrimental effects on human health and concerns that many species are affected, with negative consequences includingdie-offs of insectsand the disruption of migration patterns in bats and sea turtles.The latest study used bird recordings submitted to BirdWeather, a citizen science project that allows users to submit recordings from birds in their local area to produce a global live library of birdsong and which uses AI to allow users to identify birds in their gardens. In total the scientists analysed 2.6m observations of onset (morning) bird vocalisation and 1.8m observations of cessation (evening) bird calls, for hundreds of species. This data was combined with global satellite imagery measurements of light pollution.“BirdWeather unlocked behavioural research at large geographic and timescales,” said Pease. “We could start to learn at a scale never [done] before how birds were responding behaviourally to human forces.”The analysis found that for birds in light-polluted areas, the waking day was extended by 50 minutes on average. Species with large eyes, relative to their body size, had the strongest response to artificial light.Golden eagles poised for reintroduction in EnglandRead more“The American robin, Northern mocking bird and European goldfinch all extended their day by more than average,” said Pease. “Small-eyed species such as sparrows didn’t have as much of a response.”The impact of a longer day for birds was not yet clear, the researchers said. “We know that sleep loss is not great for humans, but birds are different,” said Pease. “They have developed interesting strategies to cope with loss of sleep during migratory periods.”A disturbance of natural behaviour patterns was of concern, Pease added, although there is evidence, in some species, that artificial lighting may increase foraging and mating time and improve the survival rate of fledglings.The findings are published in the journalScience.Explore more on these topicsBirdsAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

It could also cut battery use by more than two-thirds.The study, led by researchers at King’s College London, is the first to assess the possible impact of space solar energy on Europe. The space-based solar power (SBSP) panels that yielded the positive results uses a heliostat design. The design, which the system imitates, uses mirror-like reflectors to collect sunlight in orbit. The sunlight is then transmitted to stations on Earth and converted to electricity before it is delivered to an energy grid.The computer model of the continent’s power grid spans 33 countries, and simulates electricity demand, generation and storage to identify the lowest-cost option to meet Europe’s electricity needs.When the researchers integrated the SBSP concept into the model based onNasa’s predictionsof its potential energy capacity, results showed that it could replace as much as 80% of Europe’s land-based renewable energy.Land-based renewable energy is irregular and weather-dependent, complicating reliable supply, and comes at varying costs, the researchers point out. SBSPs could be an alternative centralised energy resource that operates above the atmosphere with continuous gigawatt-scale power.The authors note that the modelling does not account for potential impacts from space-specific challenges such as orbital congestion, transmission interruptions or beaming variability, which could influence SBSP reliability and operational performance.Nor could the potential cost-effectiveness of SBSP be realised until 2050 because building, launching and maintaining it would be too expensive unless technological growth reduces its costs.Dr Wei He, a senior lecturer at KCL’s engineering department and lead author of the study, which is published in Joule, said: “There are some risks to consider, such as how the satellite in space could have too many solar panels. Could it cause collisions or be damaged by debris in space?”Despite those risks, Wei believes the research shows that SBSP has the potential to help countries in achieving net zero. “Renewable energy to replace fossil fuels is the most important action we are taking as humans. Space-based solar power is a potential technology and can provide continuous solar power as a renewable energy source,” he said.Japan is already developing SBSPand integrating it into its space and net-zero strategy, Wei said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow and chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said the UK needed a “salvage operation” to clear up the environmental and regulatory havoc caused by Brexit.The analysis by the Guardian and the Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) has found that since Brexit the EU has brought forward 28 new, revised or upgraded pieces of environmental legislation that the UK has not adopted, and the UK has actively chosen to regress by changing four different pieces of legislation including on protected habitats, pesticides and fisheries.From clean air to pesticides: how UK has lagged behind EU on the environmentRead moreCreasy said the prime minister, Keir Starmer, needed to move more quickly to repair relations with the EU and realign on environmental law.“I am working withRichard Ticeas well as other Brexit sceptics on restoring some sort of European scrutiny committee in parliament so we can decide if and when we want to diverge rather than it all being passive,” she said.Creasy said: “We don’t have a body in parliament that knows both UK and EU law and can forge a way forward. This data from the Guardian and IEEP makes the case for having a scrutiny committee looking at if we diverge, and if we strengthen or weaken environmental protections. MPs aren’t scrutinising this at all at the moment; they don’t even know about what’s going on.”One major issue is the planning and infrastructure bill, which overrides the EU’s habitats directive and allows rare habitats such as chalk streams to be destroyed if developers pay a nature restoration levy to government.Chris Hinchliff, the MP for North East Hertfordshire, had the Labour whip removed for proposing amendments to the bill, including one to protect chalk streams from harmful development.Creasy said she supported Hinchliff and that the UK should not be regressing from EU law.She said: “I signed Chris Hinchliff’s amendments as I think he was right to bring these issues to the fore. There are good reasons to be concerned. Nobody wants to be the dirty man or woman of Europe, do they?”Starmer and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have consistently pitted the environment against growth, blaming bats and newts for a lack of housebuilding.Creasy said this was wrong: “There is no trade-off between the environment and growth; you can do both.”She added that Labour had made some positive steps towards realigning with the EU: “Under the Conservatives they were pushing very hard for isolation and they were saying there were benefits to have separate regulatory regimes as if pollution would stop at a border. It doesn’t. The UK and EU reset deal is very clear about the climate crisis and the existential threats we face and that is encouraging.”There was now less of a fear of joining in with Europe and adopting good policies that the bloc came up with, Creasy said. “The Tories wouldn’t even join the European biosecurity alerts because it had the word ‘European’ in, when there was foot and mouth in France they didn’t even want to know. We are over the hump of saying because it’s European then we couldn’t possibly do it. But now we need to scrutinise this Guardian and IEEP data and find the way forward.”She said she was relaxed about working with Reform MPs, even though their views are diametrically opposed to hers: “Richard Tice and I can disagree over the benefits of alignment but we can both agree that parliament should examine these issues. Tracking environmental regulation has fallen to external bodies … no one’s checking or holding the government to account.”Brexit campaigners said leaving the EU would allow the UK to “take back control”, but the UK has not decided on what to do about EU environmental directives and instead has passively fallen behind. For example, the EU has banned dozens of harmful chemicals under its Reach programme, while the UK’s new chemicals regulator has yet to ban a single one.“Brexit has not led to parliament taking back control,” Creasy said. “We aren’t actively making decisions on divergence. Those conversations aren’t happening.”Creasy thinks the UK should “dynamically align” with the EU, which means automatically adopting its environmental standards while reserving the right to reject some if they do not work for the UK. This means there would be less pressure on UK regulators to keep up, and it would also be helpful for trade, she believes.“I’ve always been someone who supports the business case and the business case is you align by default unless there is a really good reason for why we shouldn’t,” Creasy said. “Since leaving the EU we have only actively chosen to diverge on a handful of things, but we have passively diverged on a lot.”She added: “We need to say: can we align, how do we do that, why does it matter? We need a salvage operation because Brexit has been so damaging to our environment – there is no time to waste. We need to fight for the thing which will save the planet, which is to work with our nearest neighbours as quickly as possible.”A government spokesperson said: “There are many areas of our environmental protections, like banning bee-killing pesticides, closing sand eel fisheries, restricting bottom trawling in sensitive marine areas, where the UK’s approach is truly world leading. There is more to do, and we need to unlock growth and promote nature’s recovery. Through initiatives like the nature restoration fund, our approach secures lasting improvements for nature and helps fix the failed status quo of time-intensive and costly processes to support the building of 1.5m new homes.”Explore more on these topicsBrexitStella CreasyRichard TiceHouse of CommonsEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite the efforts of tourists and the emergency services, she could not be revived and died at the scene.Her death came weeks after theWorld Federation of Tourist Guide Associationswarned that “extreme heat is no longer an exception; it is a new reality that demands attention, adaptation, and solidarity within our profession”.Temperature records broken as extreme heat grips parts of EuropeRead moreAs tributes and condolences poured in, Italy’s Certified Tour Guide Association (AGTA) said Giammarino’s death was proof of the physical toll that guiding takes on the body, and urged the authorities to extend the Colosseum’s opening hours so tours could take place in the cool of the early morning or later in the evening.The Colosseum is open from 8.30am until 7.15pm from the end of March to the end of September.“First of all, the opening hours of the Archaeological Park of the Colosseum [which includes the Colosseum, the Forum and the Palatine Hill] need to change during summer,” AGTA said in a statement posted on social media.“It’s useless to talk about a ‘heat emergency’ every year as if this were something new: climate change is a fact and for some years, working at the Roman Forum from 10:00 to 4:30pm has been unbearable.”The association said that from the beginning of June to “at least the end of August”, the opening hours of the Colosseum area should run from 7am to 8.15pm.“For three years, we’ve been asking for the opening of the whole park to be brought forward to 7am and for closing to be postponed by an hour,” said AGTA. “These changes would benefit the public health of everyone: visitors, guides and other workers.”The association said that paltry pensions and economic uncertainty had forced many of its members to push themselves and work at an unsustainable pace in order to be able to support their families.“[On Tuesday] a guide left for ever, but in recent years too many have left this activity for other ‘safer’ and less demanding jobs,” the statement added. “We need more protection.”The Colosseum’s authorities offered their condolences to Giammarino’s family and said how much they had appreciated her “professional dedication”. Italy’s culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, said her death “powerfully underscores the human and professional value of those who, every day, contribute to the protection and preservation of our historical and artistic heritage”. In a gesture of respect and mourning, the Colosseum’s lights were turned off at 9pm on Wednesday.Last month, Italy’s national tour guide federation, Federagit, also requested that the opening of the Colosseum Archaeological Park be brought forward by an hour.Francesca Duimich, who represents 300 Roman tour guides, said dehydrated tourists often passed out in the summer heat of Rome.“The forum is a pit; there is no shade, there is no wind,” Duimich told the Associated Press. “Being there at 1pm or 2pm in the summer heat means you will feel unwell.”Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeExtreme heatClimate crisisShareReuse this content"

Firms that advertise tooth banking services claim these stem cells can be used in treatments for conditions such as diabetes as well as for autism.The investigation, by Emma Wilkinson andpublished in the BMJ, found that three companies in the UK offer tooth stem cell banking – BioEden, Future Health Biobank and Stem Protect. The service costs about £1,900, with a £95 annual storage fee.On its website, Future Health Biobanksays it has released 26 tooth stem cell samples for treatment, including for autism, type 1 diabetes and knee cartilage regeneration. Stem Protectstates on its websitethat tooth stem cells can be used for cleft palate repair and HIV/Aids among other conditions, and says “medical trials into autism and cerebral palsy involve the pulp found inside teeth and offer hope for hundreds of conditions”.BioEden’s website claimed stem cell therapy had been described as the “next frontier” for treating both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and that the company had “already witnessed the remarkable evidence of these ongoing developments” among its customers.However, experts have expressed doubts about the medical value of tooth stem cell banking.“There is a lack of evidence and a paucity of research using dental pulp stem cells to treat patients,” said Jill Shepherd, a senior lecturer in stem cell biology at the University of Kent. “There’s no evidence to suggest stem cells stored from a child’s milk tooth would ever be needed to treat that child.”Sufyan Hussain, an investigator on the UK arm of a global clinical trial evaluating stem cell therapy, said there was not a definitive answer regarding the “optimal source of stem cells for future diabetes therapies”.“This highlights how emotive this matter can be, as parents naturally want the best possible outcomes for their children,” Hussain said. “While we remain hopeful about future treatments, there is also a risk that companies might exploit these hopes to generate additional revenue.”Tim Nicholls, assistant director of policy, research and strategy at the National Autistic Society in the UK, said it was “outrageous” that tooth stem cell procedures are being advertised to parents with the claim of “treating” autism.He added: “Autism is not a disease or illness; it cannot be treated and there is no cure. It is dangerous and morally bankrupt to target potentially vulnerable people with expensive procedures that could, in fact, cause harm.”In response to the BMJ article, FutureHealthBiobank said it was looking at how information on its site is presented in order to ensure “readers can clearly distinguish between client experiences and formally published clinical outcomes”.A spokesperson for Stem Protect said: “We have made no unfounded claims, and our website has been reviewed and approved by the Human Tissue Authority. We remain committed to ensuring stem cell banking is presented as a valuable resource, backed by evidence and transparency.”Explore more on these topicsStem cellsChildren's healthHealthcare industryBiologyMedical researchHealthAutismnewsShareReuse this content"

The rain, which could spread across the UK, would also bring an end to the country’s dry spell.Early ripening of berries in UK shows nature is under stress, say expertsRead moreMorgan added: “Britain is likely to see some very large waves. Ex-hurricane Erin will bring quite a large swell in the sea so we could potentially see waves of 4 to 5 metres in height for the Western Isles ofScotlandand Ireland and so for holidaymakers going to the coast, that could prove quite a hazard.”However, Morgan said the potentially unsettled weather was still “a long way in the future” with spells of sunshine expected this weekend, which is a bank holiday for England, Wales andNorthern Ireland.Storm Erin has lost some strength in the past week as itmoved along the east coastof North America, having previously been classified as a category 5, but has still caused more than 2,000 people to be evacuated in North Carolina and at least 60 swimmers to be rescued from rip currents at Wrightsville Beach on the state’s southern coast on Monday.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherScotlandEnglandWalesNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

The BBC said another contestant would be drafted in to replace him.“With a heavy heart, I have to step back from this season of Strictly Come Dancing due to unexpected medical reasons,” Nairn said. “I was truly looking forward to the journey, and I’m deeply sorry to disappoint anyone who was looking forward to seeing me on the dancefloor. Thank you all for your support, and I will be back on my feet very soon, in every sense.”The actor became known for playing the laconic Hodor in the long-running TV seriesGame of Thrones. Asked at the height of the show’s fame if he ever got sick of being asked to repeat “Hodor” – the single line he delivered over and over – he said: “This is what I always tell people and it’s 100% true: 10 times more people ask me if I’m sick of being asked to say Hodor than actually ask me to say Hodor. It’s really weird, like a paradox.”In 2015, while still appearing on Game of Thrones, he released his debut single, a house track named Up (Club Mix) featuring Leanne Robinson, and embarked on a three-month tour across the US and UK.On Thursday, Strictly’s executive producer atBBCStudios, Sarah James, said: “We’ve absolutely loved getting to know Kristian in this short time, and he has all the makings of a brilliant Strictly Come Dancing contestant.

Then the Game Became Their Wedding Venue” in May. A few weeks later, the outlet took down the story, stating in an editor’s note: “After an additional review of the article … Wired editorial leadership has determined this article does not meet our editorial standards.”Thestory citeda “Jessica Hu”, an alleged 34-year-old “ordained officiant based in Chicago” who reportedly “made a name for herself as a ‘digital celebrant’, specialising in ceremonies across Twitch, Discord and VRChat”, according to Press Gazette, which reviewed the Wired article.Both the Press Gazette and the Guardian were not able to verify the identity of Hu.WA lawyer referred to regulator after preparing documents with AI-generated citations for nonexistent casesRead morePress Gazettefurther reportedthat in April, Business Insider published two essays by Blanchard titled: “Remote work has been the best thing for me as a parent but the worst as a person” and “I had my first kid at 45. I’m financially stable and have years of life experience to guide me.”Earlier this week, Business Insider removed the articles after Press Gazette alerted the outlet over the authenticity of the author. Both article pages now feature a message saying that the stories were “removed because [they] didn’t meet Business Insider’s standards”.In a statement to the Guardian, a Business Insider spokesperson said: “We have removed first-person essays that didn’t meet Business Insider’s standards and have since bolstered verification protocols.”In anarticlepublished on Thursday, Wired’s management acknowledged the faux pas, saying: “If anyone should be able to catch an AI scammer, it’s Wired. In fact we do, all the time … Unfortunately, one got through.”The outlet explained that on 7 April, one of its editors received a pitch about the “rise of hyper-niche internet weddings”. According to the outlet, the pitch had “all the hallmarks of a great Wired story”.Wired said that after some standard correspondence about framing and payment, the editor assigned the story which ran on 7 May.However, in the days that followed, it “became clear that the writer was unable to provide enough information to be entered into our payments system”. The outlet added that the writer insisted on payment by PayPal or check.Upon further investigation, it became clear to the outlet that the story was fabricated.In its story on Thursday, Wired said: “We made errors here: This story did not go through a proper fact-check process or get a top edit from a more senior editor … We acted quickly once we discovered the ruse, and we’ve taken steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again. In this new era, every newsroom should be prepared to do the same.”Press Gazettesaysit was first alerted to the inauthenticity of Blanchard’s articles by Jacob Furedi, editor of a new magazine called Dispatch. Furedi said that he received a pitch from Blanchard earlier this month about “Gravemont, a decommissioned mining town in rural Colorado that has been repurposed into one of the world’s most secretive training grounds for death investigation”.In the pitch, which Furedi shared with Press Gazette, Blanchard wrote: “I want to tell the story of the scientists, ex-cops, and former miners who now handle the dead daily – not as mourners, but as archivists of truth. I’ll explore the ethical tightrope of using real human remains in staged environments, the shadow economy of body donations, and the emotional toll on those who make a living from simulated tragedy.“I’m the right person for this because I’ve reported on hidden training sites before, have clearance contacts in forensic circles, and know how to navigate sensitive, closed-off communities with empathy and discretion,” she added.Fureditold the Press Gazettethat pitch sounded like it was generated by ChatGPT and couldn’t find details about Gravemont. The Guardian has also not been able to verify details of the alleged town.Upon asking Blanchard how she discovered the town, she replied: “I’m not surprised you couldn’t find much – Gravemont doesn’t advertise itself. I first heard about it while interviewing a retired forensic pathologist for an unrelated piece.”She went on to say: “Over the next few months, I pieced together more through a mix of public records requests, conversations with former trainees, and hints buried in conference materials from forensic associations. None of them referred to it by name in print, but the details lined up. Eventually, I spoke with a former miner from the area who confirmed the site’s transformation after the mine closure.“It’s one of those places that exists in the industry’s collective memory, but just under the radar enough to evade coverage – which is exactly why I think it would resonate with Dispatch readers,” Blanchard added.Fureditold Press Gazettethat despite the pitch seeming “very convincing”, he knew she was “bullshitting”. He asked Blanchard for public record requests, about her standard rate and how long she planned to spend in the field.In response, Blanchard ignored Furedi’s request to see public records requests and instead said she would “ideally spend 5-7 days on the ground” and be paid around $670, Press Gazette reports.Last Friday, Furedi accused Blanchard via email of publishing false stories to which she has not responded. Press Gazette further reports that Blanchard has not responded to its own request for her to provide evidence that she is a real person.This incident of false AI-generated reporting follows a May error when the Chicago Sun-Times’ Sunday paper ran a syndicated section with a fake reading list created by AI.Marco Buscaglia, a journalist who was working for King Features Syndicate, turned to AI to help generate the list,saying: “Stupidly, and 100% on me, I just kind of republished this list that [an AI program] spit out … Usually, it’s something I wouldn’t do … Even if I’m not writing something, I’m at least making sure that I correctly source it and vet it and make sure it’s all legitimate.

The far-right populist faces more than four decades in prison if found guilty.Court documents made public on Wednesday nightshowed federal police investigators had found a draft asylum request on the ex-president’s mobile phone addressed to Argentina’s rightwing president, Javier Milei. In the undated and unsigned document, Bolsonaro claimed he was “facing imminent arrest”​ for political motives and needed “urgent” sanctuary overseas.An Argentinian government source told the Reuters news agency that Milei’s office had not received a letter. But Brazilian police claimed the document indicated Bolsonaro had “planned to flee the country, in order to prevent the law being enforced”.After the document was released as part of a 170-page police report, supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes demanded answers from Bolsonaro’s lawyers. “The evidence gathered by the federal police indicate that Jair Messias Bolsonaro was in possession of a document designed to enable him to escape national territory,” Moraes wrote in his dispatch.Bolsonaro, who was president from 2019 until the end of 2022, was placed under house arrest in early August after the supreme court decided he had violated a court order banning him from using social media. But Moraes’s 48-hour ultimatum reportedly fuelled fears among Bolsonaro supporters that their 70-year-old leader could be now taken into custody to stop him absconding before his final judgment, which is due to start on 2 September and conclude on 12 September.Bolsonaro’s lawyer, Paulo da Cunha Bueno, admitted that the idea of going to Argentina had been suggested to his client but that Bolsonaro had rejected it. “Fleeing was never an option,” he told journalists.Bolsonaro stands accused of plotting to overturn the result of the 2022 election, which he lost to his leftwing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. He denies those charges, but political and legal experts – and many of Bolsonaro’s allies – are convinced he will be convicted.The accusation that Bolsonaro had planned to flee Brazil for Argentina came as federal police formally accused the ex-president and his congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, of trying to interfere in Bolsonaro’s judgment by encouraging US officials to put pressure on the supreme court. If found guilty of that offence they could receive a sentence of up to 12 years.Eduardo Bolsonaro moved to the US in February and has spent recent monthslobbying Donald Trump’s administration– with some success – to pile pressure on Brazil’s supreme court justices and Lula’s government over his father’s trial.In July Trumpslapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian importsin retaliation for what he called a “witch-hunt” against Bolsonaro and announced the imposition of sanctions on Moraes, who is presiding over Bolsonaro’s trial.Eight of Brazil’s 11 supreme court judges, including Moraes, have beenstripped of their US visas, as have the wife and 10-year-old daughter of one of Lula’s closest allies, the health minister, Alexandre Padilha.“It’s really a political execution that they’re trying to do with Bolsonaro. I think that’s terrible,” Trump told reporters last week.In other developments during a dramatic 24 hours for Brazilian politics, Silas Malafaia, a powerful and wealthy evangelical pastor who is one of Bolsonaro’s most vocal cheerleaders, was questioned by police after flying back from Portugal to Rio.Malafaia, who is also being investigated by federal police over suspicions he too tried to influence the outcome of Bolsonaro’s trial, has now been banned from leaving the country and communicating with Bolsonaro and his son and has been ordered to surrender his passports. “You’ll have to arrest me to silence me,”Malafaia shouted at reportersafter being released.The federal police report also exposed the foul-mouthed infighting that appears to be playing out between members of the Bolsonaro clan and key supporters in the lead-up to the ex-president’s judgment.In one WhatsApp exchange found on Jair Bolsonaro’s phone, which was seized as part of police investigations, Eduardo Bolsonaro reacts to an interview in which his father criticised him, writing in all capitals: “Go and fuck yourself you fucking ingrate!”In another message, from Malafaia to Jair Bolsonaro, the firebrand church leader attacks Eduardo Bolsonaro for publicly celebrating Trump’s tariffs on Brazilian imports. “I’m sorry, president. This son of yours Eduardo is an inexperienced prick who is handing the nationalist discourse to Lula and the left … a complete idiot. I’m fuming!”In a statement, Eduardo Bolsonaro criticised the police for “leaking private, absolutely normal conversations”. He called the move “shameful” and politically motivated and denied trying to interfere in his father’s trial.Polls suggest Lula has received a boost after Trump’s attempts to pressure Brazil’s institutions, with more than 70% of Brazilians opposed to the US president’s actions and only 21% supporting them. A poll released on Thursday showed Lula beating all of his potential rightwing rivals in next year’s election, including Bolsonaro’s wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, and a handful of conservative state governors battling to inherit leadership of Bolsonaro’s political movement.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

US tariffs on EU cars will be lowered “from the first day of the same month in which the European Union’s legislative proposal is introduced”, it says, adding that the legislation must “be consistent with this Framework Agreement and enacted by the necessary legislatures”.European leaders have some reservations. Last month the French prime minister, François Bayrou, described “a dark day when an alliance of free peoples, united to affirm their values and defend their interests, resolves to submission”.And the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said at anews conferenceearlier this week: “I support this trade agreement, but I do so without any enthusiasm,” noting the deal would have a limited impact on Spain’s economy given its smaller exposure to the US market.On Thursday, industry leadersresponded with dismay.In 2024, the EU exported €8bn worth of alcohol, including €5bn of wine, to the US, its main export market. The French wine exporters federation said on Thursday it was “hugely disappointed” by the EU’s admission that it failed to secure a tariff exemption for the sector in the US-EU trade deal.“We are certain that this will create major difficulties for the wines and spirits sector,” the head of the wine and spirits federation FEVS, Gabriel Picard, said.France’s minister for trade, Laurent Saint-Martin, said the government would seek “additional exemptions” for wines and spirits as part of the US-EU trade deal. “The agreement leaves open the possibility for additional exemptions and we’ll be working on them. The story isn’t over,” he wrote on X, adding: “I’m not saying it will be easy or that it’ll happen next week … defending our exports remains our priority.”Christophe Chateau of the Bordeaux winemakers association, said the US was his members’ biggest market and the tariff would be a “further brake” on sales. However, he said he was relieved Trump had not carried out threats to tax imports of European wine at 200%. “It could have been worse, but it’s not good news,” he added.Before the announcement on Thursday, the Swiss chocolate makers Lindt and Swiss knife producers Victorinox announced they planned to move part of their production to the US to avoid tariffs on exports.The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States also criticized the deal, noting 15% tariffs on EU spirit imports to the US could result in an estimated retail loss of more than $1bn and 12,000 jobs. “We are disappointed that this joint statement did not include permanent tariff-free trade for distilled spirits on both sides of the Atlantic,” its president and CEO, Chris Swonger, said in a statement.Of the 27 EU member states, Germany exports most to the U.S. (€161bn last year) followed by Ireland (€71.3bn), Italy (€64.8bn), France (€47.1bn) and the Netherlands (€43.3bn) according to figures from the EU’s statistics agency Eurostat.Last month, the Italian Employers’ Study Centre, warned a 15% rate combined with a 13.5% devaluation of the dollar against the euro in 2025 would cause a €22.6bnbillion decline in the country’s exports to the US.“We are talking about 15%, but in reality the surcharge will be close to 30%,” Dario Costantini, president of the CNA (the national confederation of small and medium size businesses), said. “This is an unfair and disproportionate tax that penalises products made in Italy and will also have negative repercussions on the US economy.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropeTrump administrationDonald TrumpTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the majority were “very realistic applications”, Basan said.The two winners, both German professionals, will move into spacious furnished flats in the city centre in September and be treated to a red-carpet orientation programme.View image in fullscreenThe city was built around a steel plant soon after the second world war.Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The GuardianMelanie Henniger, a 49-year-old IT consultant and self-described “empty nester” living in the north-western city of Bremen, said she had grown up in nearby Frankfurt an der Oder and was interested in returning to her eastern roots.A free flat for a fortnight: the German city offering perks to fight depopulationRead more“This is a great chance to get to know the region again, because otherwise I wouldn’t have any opportunities at all as I don’t know anyone there any more,” she said. “In the best case scenario, I can put down new roots there again.”The other successful applicant, 39-year-old Jonas Brander, is a Berlin-based film-maker working on a documentary about Eisenhüttenstadt.“I’m very interested in the city and its people and I want to get very close to life in my work,” Brander said, adding that he was drawn to its “living history”.Eisenhüttenstadt, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary, was the first city to be founded – in east or west Germany – after the Nazi period. It was built according to a socialist model designed to blend work and family life for the good of all.But the years since national reunification in 1990 have been hard on the town, which has fewer than half the 53,000 residents it counted before the fall of the Berlin Wall.The shrinking and ageing population has compounded a skilled labour shortage for local industry, in what economists say can easily turn into a death spiral.A palpable sense of decline has spurred support for the far-rightAlternative für Deutschlandparty, which won nearly 40% of local votes in theFebruary general election.The strength of the anti-migrant, anti-Islam party in many east German regions is often cited as a deterrent to new residents, especially highly qualified people from abroad.However, Basan said the programme had allowed Eisenhüttenstadt to put its best foot forward, touting its renovated and affordable neoclassical housing, verdant surroundings perfect for swimming and cycling, and plentiful childcare and work opportunities.“We even had one family, from another European country, who heard about us via theProbewohnenprogramme and are moving here on their own steam. They’ve already signed a work contract with a local company,” she said.“They did it all themselves and we’re just thrilled.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I was a little scared as well – we were this new band, putting ourselves out there. The label sent us physical copies of Adrenaline when it came out – I think we even got cassettes back then. It was so exciting to open it up and have something tangible to hold. But we had no sense of the longevity it would enjoy. I didn’t anticipate people would still be listening to it, or even that we’d still be a band this many years later. We still have nerves, obviously, whenever we release something. But we also have a sense of confidence, especiallywith this new record.Do you find your creativity burns brightest in hardship?Or can peace be just as potent?sheneadThere’s something to be said for both, and our music has that dichotomy built into its DNA – a lot of our songs have that yin and yang within them. There’s a lot more peace than chaos in our lives at the moment, and I’m happy it’s that way. A lot of our earlier records were made when life was more crazy, and we were able to capture that. But with this record, there’s some of that beauty that comes with this invigorated time we’re living in now. But it’s always good to be able to yell and scream sometimes, right? The pandemic was really difficult for everybody, but as someone who was spoilt by having this outlet my whole adult life, to be able to tour and play shows and express myself … I really came to a dead stop during Covid. It really affected me. Making music – to be able to express emotions, goodandbad – has definitely been a gift.View image in fullscreenDeftones in 1996, (from left) bassist Chi Cheng, singer Chino Moreno, turntablist Frank Delgado, drummer Abe Cunningham and guitarist Stephen Carpenter.Photograph: Gie Knaeps/Getty ImagesI work at HMV in a small town and we sell at least five copies of 1997’sAroundthe Furto teenagers every week – way more thanFleetwood Mac’s Rumours or Nirvana’s Nevermind. To what do you ascribe its longevity?DameHedwigI would hope it’s because we made some good records that have been able to transcend time, and that people of all ages find something within them they connect with. It’s probably no different from when I was a kid discovering groups like Led Zeppelin. And I’m not saying that we’re as great as them, but those bands were around for many years before I discovered them. I was able to connect with what they created, and it’s a lovely thing. We’ve always made a constant decision to not date ourselves with the music we make. We were always afraid of being lumped-in with the nu metal groups that came up at the same time we did. Not that we felt we were in another league; we just wanted to have our own identity. So we would make certain creative decisions to try not to fall too deep into any category.Deftones’Covers compilation shows a wide range of influences, including a number ofBritish artists from the 1980ssuch as Duran Duran,the Cure,the Smithsand Sade. How much of an influencewere they on your music?JimmyDIt’s the first music that I fell in love with, and it seemed very exotic to me as a sixth-grader. When you’re watching videos by Duran Duran, and they’re cruising on yachts in Sri Lanka, it just seemed like this music from far away. It was the 80s, and this stuff was pop music, but a lot of my friends were listening to Michael Jackson and stuff like that. And I loved that as well, but this British music was different. I felt very … selective, that I had this music that nobody else knew about. And there’s things there that I’ve carried over toDeftones. We’re still a hard rock/metal group, but I’ve snuck some of those influences in. And it’s not shoehorned; it’s very natural, because I genuinely have an affinity with this music.View image in fullscreenMoreno at Lollapalooza in Chicago, 2024.Photograph: Josh Brasted/FilmMagicIt seems your recent albums have had deeper, almost occult themes and symbolism. Is this intentional, orjust something unconscious coming out through your art?PhronesisIt’s unconscious. I’ve always been intrigued by things we don’t understand. It’s not me buying into any of these things at all – it’s just being curious about that which I don’t understand. I don’t do it for shock value. When I was a kid, my grandmother would go to church, and all of us kids would go to the kids’ church group, where they gave us an illustrated book of stories from the Bible. It had the scariest illustrations. I would stare for hours at these illustrations of, like, King Solomon holding up a baby by its feet. And then I’d read the story, these two people fighting over who the baby belonged to, and Solomon chopping it in half. It boggles me to this day, that it would be something a kid might read. But I’ve always had a curiosity about stuff like that.What music did you listen to when you were 22?JlimblessI was probably touring and listening to a lot of early electronic stuff and trip-hop. I was really into Portishead, Unkle, DJ Shadow and Tricky. I still love that music. It was marrying a lot of things that I love: sample-driven music, drum-forward music. It had a lot of the elements of hip-hop, but slowed down, and there was a lot of romantic imagery within it.I listen to a lot of the songs fromEros [Deftones’ unfinished sixth album, abandoned after bassist Chi Cheng was left comatose after a carcrashin 2008; he died of complications from theaccidentin 2013] floating around the internet – Dallas especially. Do you think that record will ever see the light of day?weavermachineWe’re always asked about Eros. It will most likely never see the light of day. That would involve going back to that period and resurrecting unfinished things, and somehow bringing them to completion. Dallas is the only song that was anywhere near finished. This new album started with ideas we’d been working on alone, through the pandemic. And when we got together to actually start making the record, none of us wanted to look back at those ideas from the pandemic – we wanted to capture the moment we’re in today. So going back to try to capture what was happening back during Eros, and finishing those ideas, doesn’t really make sense.Usually for me, it’s the heavier, the better– but then I heard Sextape [from 2010’s Diamond Eyes], which I love (and its mellower parts, especially).What inspired the lyrics, and how did it become the banger it is?danozismI don’t have any recollection of writing the words. A lot of our songs are written very abstract, to paint a picture of afeeling. There’s three notes that go through the whole of Sextape, and they’re very lush and beautiful – they take that side of us to the extreme. There’s beauty there, in the sonics of it. Lyrically, I just ran with that emotion.How do you separate your different creative modesbetweenDeftones and your other projects?MdrudolphI don’t. Each is its own thing, but I don’t approach them in any different way. I react how Chino would react. What I mean is, there’s no such thing as “Chino from Deftones” and “Chino from Crosses” and “Chino from Team Sleep”. There’s just one Chino. And I just react to what’s presented to me, musically, as myself. [A pause] I don’t often refer to myself in the third person. Actually, I feel like that was the first time. And I felt really weird doing that!View image in fullscreenDeftones in 2025.Photograph: PRYour cover of the Sade song No Ordinary Loveis just otherworldly. Did she ever get to listen to it or give any feedback?LazygunnThat was sacred ground because, as an artist, Sade’s unique. Even when we were recording it, it felt like a very self-indulgent thing to be doing. We weren’t intending for it to come out. The demo was recorded in my garage; we really just made it for ourselves. The fact that it ever saw the light of day at all was scary, to be honest. If you’d asked me, “Would you want to cover a Sade song, and other people are going to hear it, including possibly Sade?”, I would never have done it. I’m glad peopledolike it. I’m not sure that she’s ever heard it.If you could go back in time and offer advice to your younger self, what would you tell him?Zack_S917There’s a lot of life lessons that I had to learn the hard way, and they created the person that stands here today. I don’t have many huge regrets in life, because it all shaped who I’ve become. That said, it might be nice to go back to a few moments and tap myself on the shoulder and say, “No – gothatway.”You must get atonof love from fans, and I imagine thegiftscan get pretty creative. What’s one of the sweetest or coolestthingsyou’ve received from a fan?StarrXperiencePeople often give me drawings of myself. I always wonder what they assume I will do with them. I don’t even like to look atphotosof myself. They’re all different types of drawings – there’s cartoony ones, pen and ink ones. And I think it must bring the artist some kind of joy, that I’m holding on to a piece of art they created. “You shared your art with me – I want to share my art with you.” I do appreciate it. But because of that, I have stacks and stacks, hundreds of drawings of myself in my house.Private Music is released 22 August on Reprise/WarnerExplore more on these topicsDeftonesFilm & Music reader interviewMetalPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, 20 years on, its star and writer return with a stage revival – but they insist it’s no victory lapThu 21 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTShareDrugs, gangs, kidnappings, police corruption, murder, even necrophilia. While this might sound like the stuff of a grisly crime drama, in reality it’s the backdrop to the strange and surreal BBC sitcom Ideal. A black comedy centred on a low-level weed dealer, Moz (played by Johnny Vegas), the show has become a beloved cult classic since its original run from 2005 to 2011.After years spent lingering in the digital abyss, episodes were finally uploaded to iPlayer last year and now, 20 years since it first aired, the show is returning for a live stage production. “I didn’t appreciate how original it was when we were making it,” says Vegas, sitting in the restaurant of a plush five-star hotel in Manchester, a far cry from the rodent-infested flat he spent years in as Moz. “You only appreciate it years later, when folks are coming up going: ‘That was the one show that spoke to me – that was my life.’”As a genuinely inventive and countercultural word-of-mouth hit, the show picked up obsessive followers; there’s a dedicated Facebook group where fans share quotes, memes and clips; people gush about it on Reddit threads and have made Spotify playlists to recreate its soundtrack. When its stage return was announced, several shows sold out instantly. “There was no guarantee there’d be an audience for Ideal in 2025,” says creator and writer Graham Duff, who also plays Brian, a hilariously snippy and flamboyant gay man with an infinite number of men on his arm. “But the response has been wonderful. The phrase we keep hearing is: ‘Why has it taken so long?’”There is a feeling of unfinished business. The show was cancelled abruptly, leaving Ideal without a neat wrap-up. “Every series, I wrote the final episode thinking this could be the last one,” says Duff. “The only time I didn’t do that was [the final] series seven. By that stage, the viewing figures were so good, and we had Kiefer Sutherland saying he was going to appear in the next series. I thought: now I can stop looking over my shoulder. So it felt really brutal. We had a lot more to say.”View image in fullscreenHere’s Johnny … a younger Vegas on the set of Ideal.Photograph: Chris Bull/AlamyThe TV show featured Moz, his girlfriends, bent coppers, a gangster called Psycho Paul, a hitman called Cartoon Head (a silent character who never removed their cartoon mouse mask), some utterly bizarre neighbours, and everyone from kids and schoolteachers and DJs all swinging by to skin up and buy cannabis. It also featured a spectacular list of guest stars. Julia Davis played a partly blind clairvoyant who claims she foresaw 9/11 in a Cup-a-Soup. Sean Lock was a transgender love interest of Brian’s son (a plotline that also involves some accidental incest). Paul Weller popped up as himself, and they even managed to cast Mark E Smith, late frontman of the post-punk band the Fall, as Jesus Christ. “There’s only one person who ever turned us down,” says Duff, “and that was Kate Moss. Everybody else couldn’t say yes quick enough but her agent said she wouldn’t do anything related to drugs.”“It was a show that, against the odds, kept going,” adds Vegas. “It was almost unwanted – we were the runt of the litter at BBC Three.” The BBC, he says, “didn’t know what to do with it”. There was talk of a film to be directed by Ben Wheatley, who did series five and six of the show, but it never materialised. Then in 2021, Vegas saw the live stage show of another beloved and arguably overlooked BBC show, Early Doors. It triggered an idea: “I thought: That’s a beautiful way to get around the system,” he says.I’m not interested in nostalgia and: Oh, do you remember that thing from back then?Graham DuffThe live show will pick up 20 years later with Moz, unsurprisingly, still a dealer in his and Cartoon Head’s flat. “The story is partly a murder mystery,” explains Duff, who is keen to keep details to a minimum, “with each of Moz’s regular customers under suspicion. Moz also has a new girlfriend, Liza, and my character now has an OnlyFans – because, of course he has.”In the original TV show, Duff created a world that was vast but also intensely claustrophobic. There’s only one scene out of 53 episodes that ventures outside: everything else is shot in Moz’s or his neighbours’ flats, with an ever-rotating cast of oddballs. “At the time I was thinking: I reckon at least a quarter of the country smokes weed and will have been to a dealer,” says Duff. “But how often do you see it on TV? I thought there’s something in that: it’s a locus for all these people to cross and interact.” As such, the show isn’t really about drugs, nor was it ever intended to be. “I’ve always hated things like Cheech and Chong, where it’s like: Oh, I was so out of it I did this crazy thing,” says Duff. “I’ve got zero interest in that. It’s no more about drugs than Only Fools and Horses is about stolen goods. It’s about those characters and their interactions, dynamics, aspirations and disappointments.”The pair clearly love talking about the show. Vegas sips a vodka soda, Duff a cranberry juice, and in the deserted restaurant hall this afternoon, their frequent howls of laughter echo through the room. Vegas recalls the “spliff-making bootcamp” he had to go on before the first series, because he wasn’t much of a cannabis smoker himself. “I couldn’t get creative by smoking weed,” he says. “It just made me play [PlayStation game] Toca Racing and eat loads of toast.” He also recalls the time he and the cast had been out the night before and came in on two hours’ sleep, a bit too wobbly. A producer deemed him unfit for work, and he was told to go and lie down. “We had the best time,” says Vegas. “We worked hard, we played hard, but we delivered. I was gifted a character that always looked worse for wear.”However, such shenanigans were limited to series one. “By the second series, we all realised we were doing something that had some gravity to it,” says Duff. “We needed to protect it.” Vegas’s performance is some of his best work. Spending 53 episodes with a permanently stoned, adulterous work-shy drug dealer, confined largely to his living room, only works because Vegas is able to show him as funny, vulnerable, occasionally tender, and likable, as well as a bit of a dope. “It might be the closest thing I have given to a nuanced performance,” Vegas says, with typical self-deprecation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Several of the cast work as standup comics [Emma Fryer, Joanna Neary and Ben Crompton are all confirmed] so they know a thing or two about live comedy timing. Plus, seeing the action play out in real time really elevates the suspense – and there’s a lot of suspense in this play.”However, one thing they are clear to point out is that this is not going to be some greatest hits rehash. “I’m aware of what it means to fans and I don’t want to trample on that,” says Duff. “But it can’t just be a celebration. I want somebody who’s never seen Ideal on TV to be able to watch it and be gripped. I’m not interested in nostalgia and ‘Oh, do you remember that thing from back then? Yeah, we brought it back, and it’s almost as good as it used to be.’ Fuck that. It’s got to be bulletproof and enjoyable in its own right. I just hope people think we’ve done Ideal justice.”Vegas nods along, taking a sip of his drink, before adding: “And, if it’s shit, it’s all Graham’s fault.”Idealtoursfrom 8 Septemberto 11 October; tour starts Salford.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTheatreJohnny VegasTV comedyComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)featuresShareReuse this content"

We meet the maker of a jaw-dropping documentary about a growing phenomenonAmy HawkinsThu 21 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 00.06 EDTShareNot long into Mistress Dispeller, a quietly jaw-dropping new documentary from director Elizabeth Lo, the film’s eponymous character lays out her thesis for ridding marriages of troublesome extra lovers. “When someone becomes a mistress,” she says, “it’s because they feel they don’t deserve complete love. She’s the one who needs our help the most.”Wang Zhenxi, a mistress dispeller based in north-central China’s Henan province, is one of a growing number of self-styled professionals who earn a living by intervening in people’s marriages – to “dispel” them of intruders. “I was looking for a love story set inChina,” says Lo, speaking from Hong Kong. “I thought it would be really interesting to [explore] the peripheral gaze of a mistress.”We see Mrs Li storm out in faux anger at her husband’s cooking – in a ploy to leave him alone with the dispellerLo’s first feature,the award-winning Stray, followed abandoned dogs on the streets of Istanbul. It was praised for its gentle, non-judgmental perspective on human (and canine) relationships. Mistress Dispeller is similarly restrained, allowing the film’s central protagonists – Mr and Mrs Li, his mistress Fei Fei, and her dispeller – to be seen as fully rounded, sympathetic people.At its core, the film is, to western audiences, culturally confounding. A woman discovers that her husband is having an affair. Rather than confronting him, she hires another woman to befriend her husband. Teacher Wang, as this mistress dispeller is known, uses powers of persuasion and deception to manipulate the husband and his lover, in an effort to end their relationship. If all goes to plan, it’s happily ever after for the married couple –andfor the mistress who, in Teacher Wang’s view, is set free.View image in fullscreen‘You never call it what it is head-on’ ... mistress Fei Fei (front left) and dispeller Teacher Wang (front right)Teacher Wang’s profession, if it can be called that, has only become a phenomenon in China in the last 10 years. As the country grapples withfalling marriage rates, rising divorce rates and an increasing number of young people refusing to wed altogether, an entire “love industry” aimed at promoting and protecting the institution of marriage has emerged. There are dating camps, government-sponsored marriage initiatives and evendating appsaimed at parents wanting to set their unattached children up with partners. “Divorce is easy,” says Teacher Wang’s assistant on a live stream. “It’s easy to just leave. It’s harder to take responsibility and provide your family with a good life.”But while the struggle to find love is a universal one, hiring someone to pretend to be an old friend – so that they can persuade your husband to end his affair on your behalf – is not. Some viewers might wonder why the wife doesn’t just suggest couples therapy. Lo explains that, according to Teacher Wang, therapy is still very stigmatised in China. “To enter as a stranger and a professional into a private setting and ask someone to divulge their family struggles would be unthinkable.” Teacher Wang “would be ejected immediately”.The dispeller dynamic, while grounded in the strong cultural desire to save face, may seem very deceptive to western audiences. But Lo believes that, despite the profound conflict, there is a “kindness in doing that to each other”. She explains: “On one hand, you can say it’s very repressive, and you’re not fully dealing with the problem at its root. But from another angle, it’s also an incredibly graceful way of resolving a conflict in which nobody has to lose face. You never call it what it is head-on.”View image in fullscreenPainfully awkward scenes ... Mr and Mrs LiThe indirect approach to family conflict is reminiscent ofThe Farewell, the 2019 semi-autobiographical feature directed by Lulu Wang, a Chinese-American film-maker. The Farewell tells the story of a family who, upon learning that the grandmother has terminal cancer, decide to keep the information from her, instead hastily organising a wedding so that the relatives can gather to say goodbye to the oblivious matriarch. While the film was hailed as a bittersweet, eye-opening exploration of cultural differences in the west, some Chinese viewers found it unremarkable – why wouldn’t you lie to your grandma about her terminal cancer diagnosis?For Lo, making Mistress Dispeller was about exploring a culture different from, although closely related to, her own. Growing up in Hong Kong, which was a British colony until it was handed over to China in 1997, she devoured western romances such as Notting Hill and Bend It Like Beckham. But the storylines shaped an “idealised version of love” for the young Lo. “That version is counter to what I understood and observed love to be in my cultural context in Hong Kong, where love is bound up with duty, sacrifice. I really wanted to use this film as a way to get to know mainland China, because I’m from Hong Kong – and to represent the type of love, and vision of family, that feels distinct to Hollywood films.”View image in fullscreenComplex set-up … director Elizabeth Lo.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images for IMDbBut Hong Kong and China also have unique traditions, some of which help to explain how a job like Teacher Wang’s could exist on the mainland. China’s Cultural Revolution – a decade of upheaval and chaos between 1966 and 1976 in which many familial and social bonds were destroyed – shattered traditional hierarchies. So, says Lo, while certain beliefs and customs still run deep, China is in many ways less orthodox than Hong Kong. “A lot of dating coaches and matchmakers we talked to in mainland China said dating today in China is like the wild west, because there are no rules. People are making them up as they go.”At times, Teacher Wang’s approach certainly seems ruthless. The aim is to make the mistress feel “abandoned on a cold bench”. The situation is “just like a war. You either win or lose everything.” But the overarching feeling that emerges through the documentary’s many layers is compassion. The husband truly feels torn between his two loves. The wife shows respect for the mistress, and vice versa. Teacher Wang ultimately treats everyone with kindness.That empathy helps to answer the other burning question that the viewer has after watching Mistress Dispeller: how on earth did the cameras get in? Much of the drama unfolds in the intimacy of the married couple’s dining room, with the viewer brought so close to the scene that it feels like being a guest at a painfully awkward dinner party. In one scene, the wife, stage-managed by Teacher Wang, storms out of the room in faux anger at her husband’s cooking – a ploy to get him alone with Teacher Wang.Lo’s approach to ethical film-making required a complex set of arrangements, whereby some of the characters were initially told they were agreeing to be in a documentary about “modern love and dating in China”. Only after Teacher Wang’s work was done, and the truth was revealed, were the film crew able to reveal their true role in the process, and ask once again for consent.Lo says the fact that they agreed is “testament to how Wang was able to build such trust”. In particular, the wife agreed because Teacher Wang persuaded her that by sharing her story – and her approach to dealing with the common but rarely discussed problem of infidelity – she could help other women.Mistress Dispeller review – goodness and vulnerability shine through in candid love triangle docRead moreDespite the tension between the two women, the wife shows remarkable compassion to the mistress, something that builds as the documentary reaches its apex. While the relationships in the film may feel uniquely Chinese, Lo does make one final observation. Love, she says, “is the most relatable thing in the world”.Mistress Dispeller will be released in the UK from 22 August exclusively at Bertha DocHouse, LondonExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsChinaMarriageRelationshipsAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is in black-and-white of course, apart from the vivid red flag flown from the battleship’s mast. This rerelease is accompanied by a soundtrack composed byPet Shop Boysin 2005; it is a fervent, continuous score but not, for me, one that engages fully with the drama’s light-and-shade. It also perhaps reopens the debate about when and how a silent-movie musical accompaniment should be content to fall silent in favour of discreet ambient background sound.The subject is a 1905 anti-Tsarist mutiny on an Imperial Russian Navy battleship in the Black Sea near Ukraine. It is an uprising of sailors demoralised by losses in the Russo-Japanese war, resentful of the officers’ arrogance and incompetence, electrified by news of revolutionary enthusiasms on land, and finally triggered by the maggot-infested meat they were expected to eat.In real life, the mutineers fired on the Odesa theatre where military top brass were discussing how to suppress the rebellion and the mutineers later found that another craft sent to attack them itself underwent a mutiny in fraternal support. Eisenstein shows this, but also boldly invents an entire fictional sequence in which the Potemkin docks at Odesa (it didn’t) to display on the quayside the martyred body of their leader Vakulinchuk, played by Aleksandr Antonov (who, as he lies in state, rather resembles Joseph Stalin, who had assumed power a year before the film’s release). The passionately supportive citizenry is shown swarming down the Odesa steps to greet them, cheering wildly – only to be fired on and massacred: from above by Cossacks and by cavalry from below.View image in fullscreenTemplate for epic movies … Battleship Potemkin.Photograph: BFIThrough this, Eisenstein audaciously created from nothing a foundation myth of injustice and resistance. And for the century that came afterwards, Potemkin was an inspirational template for epic movies, action movies, war movies, period movies and thrillers. With wonderful confidence and flair, Eisenstein moves between wide shot and closeup, the panoramic scene and the telling detail; the vivid, sweaty faces are startling.It all comes together in the masterly Odesa steps scene, with that tense, Hitchcockian moment as the baby carriage begins to roll heartstoppingly down the steps. Hitchcock, though, would perhaps not have dared withhold from us, as Eisenstein does, the facts about what exactly happens to the baby. Was it all right? Or is that a bourgeois individualist question to ask?Original Potemkin beats the censors after 79 yearsRead moreAnd then there are the piercingly important individual images. Eisenstein repeatedly emphasises the spectacles of the ship’s doctor inspecting the rotten meat and airily pronouncing it more or less sound; these are not maggots, he says, but mere larvae, which can be washed off. His spectacles ironically symbolise his inability to see the truth, and there is a sickening echo when we see the blood-spattered spectacles of the woman shot in the face on the steps: she has certainly seen the truth.Perhaps as much as anything,Battleship Potemkinshows how Eisenstein saw warfare and military humiliation as vital revolutionary conditions. “Russian prisoners in Japan are better fed than we are!” shouts one maggot-maddened sailor. The original audience for Potemkin would have remembered how Russia’s suffering on the eastern front in 1917 was to contribute to the October revolutions. The army, or in this case the navy, instils in its rank and file learned habits of disciplined aggression and obedience that, in the right conditions and at the right moment, can be appropriated and rerouted into revolutionary fervour.The Potemkin brought the unquarantined spore of outrage into Odesa, revolution making a kind of landfall.Battleship Potemkin is in UK and Irish cinemas from 22 August and on Blu-ray and CD on 5 September.Explore more on these topicsSilent filmBattleship PotemkinDrama filmsPet Shop BoysRussiaEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

That live show, with the vital element of regular audience participation and dress-up, may in fact now have a bit more energy and point than the movie itself, which (whisper it) perhaps suffers a few longueurs.The undoubted star is the sonorous and feline Tim Curry playing Dr Frank-N-Furter, a vampirically queer alien sex god, proselytising here on Earth for borderless pleasure and describing himself as a “sweet transvestite transsexual from Transylvania”. Dr Furter toys with the affections of the many followers and servants at his giant castle in middle America, including his butler Riff-Raff (played by O’Brien) and tearaway Eddie (played by Meat Loaf). Dr Furter is actually focused on his Frankensteinian project of creating Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), the ideal hunky blond male to service his needs. Even Dr Frankenstein didn’t actually want to have sex with his monster.One stormy night, while Dr Furter is presiding over another of his regular hideous debauches at the castle, a wholesome young all-American couple, saving themselves for marriage, turn up rain-drenched, and ask for help because their car has broken down – in which they had actually been listening, sadly and sympathetically, to Richard Nixon’s resignation address on the car radio. They are Brad, played by Barry Bostwick, and Janet, played by Susan Sarandon; her white bra and slip ensemble is incidentally the sexiest thing in the whole film. Dr Furter relieves both of them of their virginity, individually, and Brad and Janet finally get turned on to sensual pleasure, with the film reaching an orgasmic climax of eyeliner-and-fishnet-stocking-wearing musical theatre naughtiness.It is a genuine one-off, a movie whose own identity has now overshadowed its ostensible purpose: to spoof the classic movie chillers of yesteryear. There are pious invocations of Fay Wray in King Kong and Claude Rains in The Invisible Man, although Rocky Horror itself has long since become a spoofable mainstay and in any case cinephilia isn’t the point; the point is sex, the pervier and freakier the better. Don’t dream it, be it, says The Rocky Horror Picture Show, with all the fervency that Hair once sang about the dawning of the age of Aquarius. It seems a little quaint, but there’s still a high raunch factor.The Rocky Horror Picture Show is in UK cinemas from 22 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmRocky Horror ShowComedy filmsMusicals (Film)Tim CurryMeat LoafSusan SarandonreviewsShareReuse this content"

One moment you’re on a romantic walk in the woods with your saintly, supportive husband as he convinces you to stand for election as prime minister, the next youarethat prime minister (with the shorter but still flattering haircut to prove it). You’re knee-deep in a cancer drug supply crisis and about to meet with the French president who alone can solve your problem, when news arrives that your saintly, supportive husband – who is, of course, a doctor with Doctors Without Borders – and his team have been abducted by unknown terrorists in French Guiana. What is aSuranne Joneswith a Netflix budget behind her to do?That is the set-up from which five punchy hours – Hostage fully swerves the curse of streamer-bloat – of great, globetrotting fun proceeds. Jones is the no-nonsense (in a good way, not a Thatcher way) politician-turned-PM Abigail Dalton;Julie Delpyis the icy president and master strategist Vivienne Toussaint; and Ashley Thomas is Dr Alex Anderson, Dalton’s blameless and soon deeply traumatised husband. Before news of the kidnappings arrives, Dalton is hoping to cut a deal with Toussaint that will involve the UK taking in a boatful of Ebola-ravaged refugees that were refused entry at Calais in return for France giving the UK a large amount of lifesaving medicine. Deux political crises averted with une stone, you see. Then the terrorists step in and demand as their ransom Dalton’s resignation by 1pm the next day.I should add that also in the mix are: Abigail and Alex’s semi-stroppy daughter Sylvie (Isobel Akuwudike) and Abigail’s dying father Max (James Cosmo), both of whom are strongly of the opinion that she should resign and bring Alex home; private secretary Kofi Adomako (Lucian Msamati), an appointee of the previous government and as yet unsure of his new boss’s fitness for purpose; Adrienne Pelletier (Jehnny Beth), the ice queen’s warmer and surely trustworthy assistant; and last but decidedly not least, Toussaint’s stepson Matheo (Corey Mylchreest), who deplores his stepmother’s political shift to the right, and his new girlfriend Saskia (Sophie Robertson). Think of them as a quiverfull of arrows ready to be fired the moment we need another plot twist, red herring, complication, revelation or downright treachery, and always landing on target. Offshore accounts, leaks, misplaced and well-placed loyalties abound, with ever-changing political considerations and their ramifications woven credibly in.Oh, and did I mention that Dalton is considered to have “gutted the military” to fund her promises to fix the NHS? Though I’m sure this won’t have repercussions if and when she needs their help to rescue her husband and his equally saintly, supportive team.The first rescue mission, however, is by the French because it is their territory. Alas, it is aborted at the last minute when Toussaint receives a very effective blackmail video that threatens her leadership and would, if she were ousted, leave the way clear for a truly fascistic candidate to stand, which is what her apparent pandering to the right-wing has been designed to deflect. Hidden depths, you see, and subtleties. Hostage onion-skins its episodes very nicely.It’s a rollicking, propulsive and compulsive yarn that also manages to give two great parts to two women of a certain age then leaves them to get on with it as characters rather than symbols. There is perhaps a little too much of Dalton kicking off her high heels in relief every time she’s alone, but other than that the two leaders are as unremarkably female as the usual players would be unremarkably male. Of course, this shouldn’t still be rare, but it is, and feels refreshing and worthy of note.As losses mount, the question of how much a leader should be expected to sacrifice for her country comes under greater scrutiny. Does there come a point when you have to give in to terrorists? How do you appraise a concept like the greater good, which has become so emptied of meaning in modern times? And what if the great British public has been baying for your blood beforehand? And the sympathy they have for your predicament lasts no longer than the next viral video showing the death or suffering of an individual unable to procure the drugs they need?Everyone is terrific in this, and the budget is well spent on location shoots in French Guiana (or somewhere very like it), with Jones doing her usual sterling work as an everywoman in extraordinary circumstances. Or at least everywoman as prime minister in extraordinary circumstances. I do find myself occasionally wishing that she would treat herself and us to a comedy – or something with a comic aspect – more often, but when the dramas are this much fast, furious, intelligent fun, I suppose we shouldn’t ask for more.Hostage is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJulie DelpySuranne JonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

His birthday is belatedly being marked by Sony Classical with a repackaging (with all the original sleeve notes as well as new material) of the four albums that Riley recorded for the Columbia label in the 1960s and 70s and which made his name internationally. The first two of them contained what have remained his most celebrated works: In C was recorded in 1968 with a seven-piece ensemble overdubbed to create 25 instrumental voices in the final mix, and A Rainbow in Curved Air appeared the next year, with Riley himself playing a variety of keyboard instruments. After In C, Riley was signed up for a three-record deal that began with A Rainbow, but the following two discs have been less influential: Church of Anthrax was a 1971 collaboration between Riley and John Cale, while Shri Camel, another solo effort from Riley, dates from 1977 but was not released until 1980.View image in fullscreenTerry Riley: The Columbia RecordingsIf listening to these works again reinforces admiration for In C, even though some later recordings of what is now a seminal work are tauter and more incisive than this original, it suggests that nothing in Riley’s later works possess anything like the same originality and raw rigour. Even A Rainbow, with its layers of decorative improvisation, seems self-indulgent now, and nothing on the other two albums is any more impressive. The set is a reminder that the historical importance of Riley’s early music is undeniable, but how much of it deserves our attention now is more debatable.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicTerry Rileyalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Strange Love, the debut album by new Melbourne supergroup Bleak Squad, is one such gift. The names speak for themselves: Adalita (Magic Dirt), Mick Harvey (the Bad Seeds, the Birthday Party), Mick Turner (Dirty Three) and Marty Brown (Art of Fighting, SodaStream, Claire Bowditch), who brought the band together.Brown’s intuition that such a combination would go well together has proven inspired. Such things can easily end up sounding better on paper than in practice. Instead, Bleak Squad sound pretty much exactly as you’d expect, given their name and collective histories: the hour is late, the lights are low, the writing is sharp, the arrangements are tight – but the playing is expansive and open-ended, with songs designed to be stretched out in live performance.Ninajirachi: I Love My Computer review – a surprisingly moving tribute to 2010s EDMRead moreThis is a genuine collaboration, with significant written contributions from all four members. Vocals are shared mainly by Adalita and Harvey, with guitars by Adalita and Turner. Harvey, the best multi-instrumentalist, does a bit of everything, while Brown takes most of the drums, piano and more besides. In lesser hands, it could be a dog’s breakfast, but the sound Bleak Squad have arrived at is coherent and fully formed.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningOf course, Adalita, Harvey and Turner are all established soloists, with distinctive voices. You can hear echoes of all four members’ respective projects, and the ghost of Harvey’s old bandmateRowland S Howardseems to hover over all of it. But nothing feels forced or contrived. It’s a real band: Strange Love sounds more like a fourth album than a first, by an act that’s honed their craft for years.The reality of how the record was made is quite different. Bleak Squad’s method was to play each other their songs once, teaching the basic parts, do a run-through, then record the second take, leaving room for soloing or improvisation. The nine songs flow like a river, usually unhurried, occasionally cascading over rapids. To an extent this lends an element of sameness (and it does, at least on the first listen), but it also feels like one long, satisfying trip.Adalita is at the top of her game here. Unabashed about playingwith her heroes– Turner and Harvey coming from the musical generation before hers – her vocals and lyrics on Safe as Houses and Lost My Head are richly assured. The delicious surprise is what a great foil the ever-deadpan Harvey makes for her, whether in duet (Everything Must Change, World Go to Hell) or when he steps up for lead vocals (Ghost of the Bad Humour Man).The latter is one of this album’s highlights, and provides welcome comic relief. It’s actually not quite as bleak as it sounds: on face value, Harvey could be talking about depression, but he could also be poking fun at his rather stoic image. “I told my jokes, those caustic puns, / not popular with everyone, / as dry as dust, / they obscure the sun,” he sing-speaks, like an Australian Lou Reed.

But now, it seems, Lim feels it is time to reveal a more expressive, intimate side to his playing, and indeed it’s hard to imagine anything more different from the Chopin and Rachmaninov than Tchaikovsky’s suite The Seasons.View image in fullscreenYunchan Lim: Tchaikovsky: The SeasonsBegun immediately after the premiere ofTchaikovsky’s first piano concerto and composed in parallel with his ballet Swan Lake, the series of 12 miniatures that make up The Seasons were commissioned by a magazine, and published monthly through 1876. They were intended to be played by amateurs, and the technical demands most of them make are modest. But their charm and lyric beauty have made them a popular part of many concert pianists’ repertory, whether as encore pieces or played as a selection in a recital.Each piece in the set has a descriptive title, appropriate to the time of year it illustrates: January is “By the Fireside”, March “Song of the Lark”, May “White Nights”, and so on. But in his sleeve notes, Lim offers his own provocative interpretation of the cycle. “Tchaikovsky’s The Seasons,” he claims, “depicts the final year in a person’s life.” What justification he might have for this assertion, apart from the composer’s generally jaundiced view of life, isn’t clear, and loading these often innocent miniatures with such a subtext seems wilfully obtuse. But perhaps Lim’s gloomy view of the work explains why his tempi for some of the pieces seem on the slow side, never quite to the point of sounding laboured, but certainly slow enough to give the music more gravitas than usual. Everything else about Lim’s playing is, as you would expect, exemplary, but several other pianists, most recently another major prize winner,Bruce Liu, present them in a less knowing, more guileless way.Is this 20-year-old the greatest pianist of our times?

It’s hard to imagine a writer shedding new light on the band given the mountain of literature already in existence. But there is a freshness of perspective in Ian Leslie’s book, which tells of Lennon and McCartney’s unique alchemy through the songs they wrote together. Leslie’s background in psychology serves him well in a study that jettisons the usual narrative of male rivalry; their partnership, Leslie suggests, was closer to a marriage.He begins with the pair’s early songwriting sessions, usually in McCartney’s front room, where rather than each taking ownership of songs, they worked in sync. Other fabled musical partnerships such as Leiber and Stoller, or Rodgers and Hammerstein, divided the labour between lyrics and melody, but Lennon and McCartney worked together on both. Pointing to their profound connection, Leslie notes how in the song If I Fell they performed “an intricate courtship dance, moving apart and close again as the song unfolds, like birds weaving in and out of each other’s flight path, alternately shielding and leading the other”.The Thick of It actor Chris Addison is the book’s fluent and engaging narrator, and his enthusiasm for the topic is clear. The audio edition also has a bonus chapter featuring a terrific conversation between Leslie and presenter and podcaster Geoff Lloyd, where they ponder the continued enthusiasm for all things Beatles: “In terms of scale and complexity of achievement, there’s very few people who come close to what John and Paul did,” says Leslie. “People say ‘Do we need more books about the Beatles?’ It’s only just begun, in my view.”Available via Faber, 14hr 9minFurther listeningStone Yard DevotionalCharlotte Wood, Sceptre, 6hr 36minThis novel by The Natural Way of Things author finds a middle-aged woman leaving her life and marriage in Sydney to return to the religious community in the Australian outback where she grew up.

That’s not forgetting the riddlers, slaggers and snobs. And before you say anything, these are all occupations that were once ubiquitous but are now vanishingly rare: a bodger makes chair legs; a badger is someone who etches glass; a fat boy is a greaser of axles in haulage systems, while a snob is a journeyman maker of boots and shoes.According to the main charity that supports traditional skills, 285 crafts are still practised in Britain, of which more than half are endangered. Seventy-two are on the critical list and it is these, and the people who practise them, that James Fox sets out to record. He meets the Nobles, who are the pre-eminent stone-walling family “in Britain, if not the world”. Mostly they stick close to home, in the West Yorkshire village where they have farmed, and walled, for centuries. Building a dry-stone wall requires an extraordinary kind of embodied knowledge, the sort that knows instinctively how to use gravity, friction and exactly the right-shaped rock to build a structure that allows moorland gales to whistle through and remain standing. Done right, a dry-stone wall will last 200 years, compared with a post-and-wire fence which needs replacing after 20.It would be nice to report that a walling renaissance is underway. Not exactly, says Fox, for the simple reason that it is uneconomical: even with government subsidy, a waller typically gets less than £85 a metre, working in conditions that only allow for a few metres a day. However, there is a lucrative demand from the owners of private landscaped gardens and tourist attractions. The Nobles recently flew to Japan to build a wall in Cotswold stone for a complex in Gifu. Fox urges us not to judge, emphasising that “crafts have always responded to the evolving needs of society”.This matter-of-fact attitude is shared by many of the people who appear in this book. Some of them downright dislike what Fox dubs “the C-word”. One Devonshire wheelwright explains that “craft” to him suggests a church fayre. “I’m not a craftsman, this isn’t a hobby, and I’m not keeping anything ‘alive’. This here is a trade.” Felicity Irons, a rush merchant and weaver who makes her living on the Great Ouse, barks furiously at Fox when he gauchely asks her on a cold November morning if she finds her job relaxing. “Of course it isn’t. It’s bloody hard work, just like any other job.” Even a woman whom Fox interviews in Hackney Wick making ceramic noodle bowls rejects the “craft” tag, telling him sternly that she is a “multidisciplinary artist and researcher”.Despite the caveats and the pleas to remain hard-headed, Craftland is a book that shimmers with love for a dwindling world of meticulous, patient labour. Fox becomes positively lyrical when describing the work of Roger W Smith, a master horologist on the Isle of Man who makes watches that are so special that only 20 emerge from his workshop each year. Sheets of gold, steel, brass and beryllium are hauled into the machine room at the back of the building, and months later an intricate piece of engineering emerges, carefully swaddled, from the front. These delicate assemblages of wheels, levers and jewels perform a kind of philosophical magic, converting the invisible forces of the universe into an insistent tick. You won’t get one for under £300,000.Fox works hard to stiffen his account of Britain’s lost crafts with statistics, places and dates. Despite this, there is a feeling that this genre of impressionistic place-writing is reaching its own expiry date. Over the past 10 years we have been deluged by books recovering the lost heritages of knitting, fishing, letter-pressing, hill farming and much more. While the illustrations in Craftland are lovely, it feels inevitable that they are woodcuts, linocuts and pen-and-ink drawings, all pictorial forms that now border on the overfamiliar. Craftland is both deftly written and well researched, but it feels like the kind of publication that is itself slipping into obsolescence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Thirty-two monks stand vigil at the deathbed; “Mimo” Vitaliani has lived among them for 40 years, yet few of them know exactly why. Nor did Vitaliani come alone, but with a mysterious statue that is kept under lock and key in the depths of the Sacra di San Michele, a pietà depicting the Virgin Mary mourning over the body of Christ, whose faces must not be seen. And all the while, the abbot tiptoes around the dying man, waiting for a word. These and others are the mysteries French writer Jean-Baptiste Andrea’s prize-winning fourth novel sets out to solve, mapped on to the course of an extraordinary century in the history of a resilient, self-sabotaging and remarkable nation.Born in France to Italian parents in 1904, at the dawn of a new world order, Mimo is destined never quite to fit (nor, incidentally, ever to grow taller than 4ft 6in). His father was a stone carver who had hubris enough to christen the boy Michelangelo before getting himself conscripted and blown to bits; Mimo refuses the name, and yet finds himself taking up the art all the same.Shipped off at 12 to Turin as an apprentice to the reluctant Zio Alberto – an uncle who isn’t an uncle – Mimo has to overcome his stature, his rootlessness and his prodigious natural talent, which seems to do nothing but rub people up the wrong way. When the apprentice turns 16, Zio Alberto moves his workshop to the country and the pair arrive in the lofty rose-coloured Ligurian village of Pietra d’Alba, “carved out of the sunrise”, where Mimo sees his first pietà, carves his first cherub – and meets the one person with whom he feels he belongs: Viola Orsini.The narrative is enjoyable and gripping in a combination not often found in prestigious prize winnersScion of a noble family whose orange groves carpet the plateau, sister to three brothers – Virgilio, a would-be soldier, Stefano, a troublemaker who dabbles in politics, and Francesco, a priest – Viola is as much at odds with her world as Mimo is with his. A scientist, an inventor, a futurist, a voracious reader with a photographic memory and, according to local rumour, shapeshifting powers, Viola wishes to fly like poet-pilot Gabriele d’Annunzio, but her parents require her to marry money and reproduce. And the “repulsive little creature” who falls into her bedroom while undertaking repairs on the Orsini roof is a long way from their idea of marriage material.In secret, though, the pair cling to each other. Cosmic twins, contrarians desirous of a new world, and the oddest of couples, each has found his or her match for stubbornness and determination. But Mimo and Viola were born into “a century that moves too fast”: by 1920, fascism in Italy is on the march, and politics, family, Viola’s recklessness and Mimo’s “somewhat suicidal temperament, professionally speaking” soon separate them. They must each navigate the future their worlds impose upon them. Viola is to be an aristocratic mother, when her heart is set on forging progress; Mimo is set on a pedestal as a “fascist artist”, derided as a “degenerate dwarf” and lauded as a partisan hero, when he simply wants to sculpt. Thus a pattern is set in motion – of exile and reconciliation, triumph and disaster – that will last the rest of their lives.The narrative is enjoyable and gripping in a combination not often found in prestigious prize winners, and it takes a page or two to understand why this big fat historical blockbuster won the Prix Goncourt. But even in translation – and this is a fluid example of the craft – its poetry and its nuance, its passion and philosophical depth, its grasp of moral ambiguity, its clever interweaving of history and fiction, and its superlative characterisation rise quickly to the surface.Contrary, self-sabotaging Mimo, “disagreeable” by his own estimate, is a masterly creation, as is his proud, mercurial, impatient soulmate. But the novel is also rich in smaller characters, from the lazy Machiavellian Stefano to hardworking Vittorio, whose otherworldly twin brother Emmanuele is prone to speaking in tongues and dressing up in ragtag begged-and-borrowed uniforms: a clue to the note that sounds loudest in Watching Over Her. Because this is most significantly a song of love to a country of contradictions, battered, war-torn, divided, misguided and miraculous: an Italy where life is costume and the performance of art, and where circuses spring up on wasteland. The Italy that produced both Mussolini and Fellini, fascists and futurists and communists; where “beauty is always imperilled” and “genius grows like a weed”.Watching Over Her by Jean-Baptiste Andrea, translated by Frank Wynne, is published by Atlantic (£14.99).

She has just successfully argued in front of a court that a river running through the fictional version of the Indian city of Muziris should have the same rights as a person. According to Kuyili, this has precedent – after all, companies can argue in court similarly to individual people.The excitement over this historic win doesn’t last long as, soon after, the river is polluted by a large oil spill, which catches fire, the toxic smoke enveloping several neighbourhoods. Pollution on this scale has devastating effects, so Kuyili and her colleagues begin investigating.All Will Rise is effectively a deck-building game built around verbal sparring. In order to prepare for an important conversation, you first send Kuyili and her colleagues to different people in the community to gather information. Those trips net you cards, which you can then use as arguments. Claims cards can appeal to different emotions and each one has a different validity based on the information you have gathered. Saying that a corporation’s illegal waste disposal is responsible for the pollution of the river, for example, may get your opponent fired up, but if the card is mere speculation, as opposed to something you can back up with definitive proof, they may reject it.View image in fullscreenVerbal sparring … All Will Rise.Photograph: Speculative AgencyWhile it’s a lot to absorb at first, the card-based conversations aim to represent the many ways a conversation can go. While developer Speculative Agency cites courtroom comedy Ace Attorney as one of its inspirations, shouting “Objection!” will not necessarily get you what you want here.“Talking to people in All Will Rise is based on the idea that you often partner with another person when you’re having a conversation,” Speculative Agency’s co-founder and producer Niels Monshouwer says. “In Dutch we use the wordgesprekspartner, conversational partner, for the person you’re talking to, and conveying that feeling of partnering with someone was important to us.”In conversation and information gathering, characters expend emotional energy, a system based on what it can take out of you to engage in activism or simply keep up with the news. “Looking at the state of the world, we experience the same pain that everybody in their right mind is having,” says narrative director Meghna Jayanth. “But every time we meet, we feel empowered, stronger, happier. There are so many people out there trying to do the right thing. Don’t stay alone – organise, collaborate. This is where you will feel strong. We want the game to give people that feeling, and hopefully take that back out into the real world.”All Will Rise is not only set in India. Each chapter will shed light on the environmental challenges in a different part of the world and people’s efforts to counteract them. “We haven’t completely decided yet, but we are thinking about Puerto Rico, the Netherlands and maybe Nigeria,” says Monshouwer. “The first case deals more with pollution, corporate exploitation and local government corruption. But we’re also thinking about topics such as biodiversity loss, climate change and destruction of ocean floors due to mining.”View image in fullscreen‘Inappropriately joyful’ … All Will Rise.Photograph: Speculative AgencySpeculative Agency, which is planning a Kickstarter campaign to raise funding for the game, wants to include countries its developers are based in, which Monshouwer feels is crucial for tackling these subjects with authenticity. Another important driver for the studio is the work of its science and impact director, Joost Vervoort, who is an associate professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, working at the intersection of games and sustainability. Vervoort’s research group Anticiplay, has already explored how the climate crisis can be dealt with in games and is working to make sure All Will Rise can empower players with real-life facts around climate activism.The team has found that while the number of games tackling real-world issues is rising, there is still a lot of space for improvement. “In our first chat together we found that too many games that deal with climate change, pollution or other forms of societal collapse fall into two categories: green god games and toxic wasteland games,” says Monshouwer.“Toxic wasteland games are games where the collapse is a backdrop and the message is that there is no hope. Green god games put you into the shoes of an omnipotent being that decides where to put magic machines that clean up pollution. It oversimplifies the problem to a technical instead of a societal one, and nobody in the world has that much power. We wanted to make games about the process of change and what you can do as an individual within a community, instead of being the lone hero.”While the subjects that All Will Rise tackles are heavy, Jayanth says that it is a joyful game at its core. The team has even described the game as “inappropriately joyful” given, well, everything. “If we look around at the world right now, it would be easy to say it’s inappropriate to feel joy,” says Jayanth, who has long used her position in the gaming industry for activism. “But joy powers transformation. Rage does too, and we have plenty of that in the game as well. But we as a team feel like hope is the only useful political response to the challenges facing us all.”Ultimately, All Will Rise is meant to show that it’s never too late to get involved in activism, even though the challenge can feel daunting. “Our ideal reaction to the game would certainly be if someone went out and got involved,” Jayanth says. “There are many more types of activism than tying yourself down somewhere or joining a demonstration, and we hope people will feel inspired to give it a try.”All Will Wise is set for release on PC, date is to be confirmedExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsIndie gamesStrategy gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Isthiswhat we had in mind? The joke is on the queasy atmosphere the Mancunian establishes at his shows, barking in the audience’s faces, behaving unstably and – this time around – loudly bellowing “I tried to suck off my dad”, over and over again. Is there a therapist in the house? Well, there doesn’t need to be, because Tiernan has devised “the System”, a three-point plan to heal himself after a drug-induced psychotic episode between Glastonbury 2024 andlast year’s Edinburgh fringe show.We are three new shows into the 29-year-old’s fringe career now, and All In again finds him addressing his dyspraxia, his drug use and his failure to fit in. I hanker for the show that directs his considerable comic talents elsewhere, but in the meantime, this is his strongest offering so far, the self- and audience-abusing comedy now underpinned by structure and tending towards a big payoff. It begins with an inventory of the drugs Tiernan used to take, then splices in stories from his beloved Glastonbury festival, including a keeper about smuggling his gear in a jar of Nutella.The freshest material addresses his internalised homophobia, as we journey from his teenage years, furtively fantasising over Justin Bieber, to (not very) grownup life lived in fear of gay sex – scarier than the hetero alternative, he argues, in characteristically lurid terms. His problems now laid out, Tiernan moves on to elucidate “the System” itself, neatly flipping the script and making way for a rousing, Glasto-alike finale.By then, Tiernan is stripped to the waist and performing with even wilder commitment than across the 50 minutes prior. You might wince now and then at the crudeness, occasionally superfluous, of his material: we don’t need the act-out after the elliptical gag about his mum, his backside and poppers. But more often than not Tiernan nails it here, with a surreptitiously tender tale of a manchild adrift just about visible behind all the stark gags about his very dysfunctional lifestyle.AtMonkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

James Ijames’s play won a Pulitzer prize in 2022; set at a Southern backyard barbecue, its sensibility, Black and queer, does more than piggyback on Shakespeare’s tragedy.This play’s pensive prince is Juicy (a winning Olisa Odele). His father has just died in prison, and the sun-bright party celebrates the hasty marriage of Juicy’s mom and uncle. Strapping but soft, in his Mama’s Boy T-shirt, Juicy’s moping irks his new stepdaddy (“think he some kinda philosopher-poet”).Manning the grill is Uncle Rev: greedy, domineering, knows his way round a pig. A limber Sule Rimi plays Rev and the furious ghost of Juicy’s Dad, emerging from a gingham tablecloth to demand gut-spilling vengeance (“it’s a bit Old Testament,” winces Juicy). Hamlet is a tragedy of the young trapped in the ethics of their elders: Ijames lets them talk back. The ghost may crave justice, but was also a harsh father, mean husband and a murderer. Must Juicy live in his shadow?View image in fullscreenResplendent … Sandra Marvin in Fat Ham.Photograph: Ali WrightShakespeare’s characters are hemmed in by bad choices and narrow options. Here they dream big: this play’s Ophelia wants to open a shooting range, its Horatio ponders starting an OnlyFans account and Polonius becomes a clucking church lady with a past (Sandra Marvin, resplendent in mauve). What does Juicy want? He is still finding out.Audiences seeking Shakespeare references will be in hog heaven: the conscience-catching play becomes a game of charades, and people keep catching Juicy mid-soliloquy and wonder what secrets he’s spilling. Ijames’s writing is full of charm and crackle, and there’s a bravery in his refusal to valorise tragedy or trundle through inherited trauma. Why must stories end in death? What if we lose the swords and instead do shots?‘What if everyone didn’t die?’ The queer, Pulitzer-winning, happy-ending HamletRead moreThe play’s commitment to joy is elevated by the fun-times production (by Sideeq Heard, based on Saheem Ali’s original) and a terrific British cast (Jasmine Elcock’s glowering, kinetic Opal is a particular treat). There’s good booty work in the choreography by Darrell Grand Moultrie: never mind the hams, it’s all about the butts.

Instead, it features Cardinal himself, performing and deconstructing the kind of “land acknowledgment” with which public performances in North America are nowadays introduced. To Cardinal, the ritual is a vacuous apology in lieu of reparations or reversal of the original offence. But, if we’re in the acknowledgment game – well, there are plenty of other issues around Indigenous life, and the lives of those of us in the audience, that could use some acknowledging.What follows bears scant similarity to Shakespeare, only a little to theatre, and slightly more to lecture-meets-standup;Hannah Gadsby’s Nanetteleaps to mind. Like Nanette, Cardinal’s show majors in making its audience as uncomfortable as possible, as he arraigns us with Britain’s history of genocidal violence, the feebleness of our presumed allyship with oppressed groups – and, latterly, with the discovery of the remains of hundreds of Indigenous children at school sites around Canada. He prowls the stage, wired, angry, cracking bleak jokes, as one disgruntled festivalgoer after another makes for the exit.Fat Ham review – Hamlet becomes a booty-shaking barbecue in glittery Pulitzer winnerRead moreThat’s understandable: this is a confrontational performance. It’s also one created in a North American context, that loses something in translation at the Edinburgh international festival – not least its audience’s stake in the “land acknowledgment” convention. Not all of Cardinal’s transpositions to the UK feel well informed. Some of his generalisations, about white prejudice and virtue signalling, rankle and feel cynical. His arguments take “jumps in logic”, by his own admission, that make them hard to follow.But there are hard truths here, too, about the stubbornness of systemic subjugation and the racism inherent even in positive representations of Indigenous life. In any event, Cardinal seems beyond aesthetic or ideological fine-tuning at this point, and his As You Like It is less “insinuating with us in the behalf of a good play” (in Rosalind’s words), more howl of pain and anger. It’s an act of reverse colonisation, seizing our space and making it his own. It’s not always agreeable, but it demands to be heard.AtChurch Hill theatre, Edinburgh, until 23 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalAs You Like ItComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

You’d think the question barely needs asking – butElouise Eftoshas done so, and received quite the reaction. She makes a stellar fringe debut with Australia’s First Attractive Comedian, a tongue-in-cheek title some have treated, by her account, as no laughing matter.Should we be surprised the relationship between comedy, feminism and sexiness isn’t as resolved as we might have thought? In the space between them, the Perth comic makes great stacks of hay here, in a show premised on her extreme hotness. She chats to an audience member; we cut away to the erotic Elouise Eftos fantasy unfolding in that person’s head. She demonstrates the yawning gulf between herself and “normies”. She jokes about cat-calls, and the expulsion from the Beatles of handsome Pete Best. She makes common cause with her fellow bombshell, that innocent bank-teller turned patron saint of making wives jealous, Dolly Parton’s Jolene.Is it all a hilarious wind-up? Or are we to take Eftos’s lofty self-image at face value? The show’s neat trick is to be equally funny regardless, or because, of that ambiguity. Either way, Eftos has nailed a wickedly amusing and original stage persona, sky-high self-regard but charm in spades too, all flashed smiles, tossed hair and matter-of-fact superiority to we lesser mortals in her crowd.And, unlike beauty, the show is not only skin deep. In its later stages, Eftos keeps pushing her ideas – and what we might think about them – into material about sex, her body and a final sequence, in character as a malfunctioning “femmebot”, that implies some unstated ambiguity about the role she’s choosing (or has been forced?) to play.There’s also a questioning routine about the act’s feminist credentials, which get sharply challenged by one or two senior female comedians – whose shocking correspondence with Eftos is displayed on an upstage screen. Impudence – towards her elders, towards the comedy industry at large – is a feature of this fabulous provocation of a comedy hour, nipping and tucking at our ambivalent relationship with good looks.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

In it, he bequeathed New Place, reputedly the second grandest house in Stratford-upon-Avon, to his own cousin Edward Nash.However, on Thomas’s death in 1647, Shakespeare’s daughter, Susanna Hall, and granddaughter Elizabeth, Thomas’s widow, refused to honour the will, claiming Shakespeare’s own will had decreed the property be left to them and Thomas had no right to bequeath it.The result was chancery court proceedings, lodged by Edward against Elizabeth, to claim the valuable property.The Nash will has now been rediscovered in a box of unlabelled chancery documents from the 17th century and earlier by Dr Dan Gosling, a principal legal records specialist at theNational Archives.“It was an incredible find,” said Gosling, who was sorting through the boxes, which were not catalogued or marked with dates or descriptions.A section of thee 1642 document.Photograph: The National ArchivesThe will was known about in the mid-19th century after being seen by a Shakespeare scholar when originally held in the Rolls chapel. When documents were later sorted it ended up in the unmarked box. “It wasn’t listed, and then was left there for about 150 years or so,” said Gosling.Shakespeare bought New Place, a three-storied timber and brick dwelling, for £60 in 1597 and lived there until his death in 1616. It had 10 fireplaces, five handsome gables and grounds large enough to incorporate two barns and an orchard.Thomas Nash made the will while living at New Place with his Susanna and Elizabeth. Though Shakespeare’s will had left his land and the property to his daughter and granddaughter, “it is possible Thomas Nash was making this will in the expectation that he would outlive Susanna and Elizabeth”, said Gosling.“But what actually happened was he died in 1647. He was very young. Elizabeth was still only 39 and in fact remarried afterwards.” Susanna died in 1649.Susanna and Elizabeth created a deed of settlement confirming their rights. “Then Edward Nash takes Elizabeth to court. He argues the will of Thomas Nash was proved in the property court of Canterbury, and Elizabeth Nash, as the widow and executrix, was duty bound to abide by the terms of the will and give New Place to Edward Nash.”Elizabeth appeared at the chancery court to explain the lands and property were granted to her and her mother by “my grandfather William Shakespeare”. As part of proceedings she was asked to produce Thomas’s will, which is how the document eventually ended up in the chancery archives, now held by the National Archives.The upshot of the proceedings is not clear, but, Gosling said, it appears Edward never got to own the property. When Elizabeth died in 1670, having had no children and ending Shakespeare’s direct line of descendants, her will stipulated Edward Nash would have the right to acquire New Place.“She uses the words ‘according to my promise formally made to him’, which suggests some spoken procedures were made,” said Gosling. In the event, there is no recorded mention of Edward as owner of New Place, which went to the wealthy landowning Clopton family after Elizabeth’s death and was demolished in 1702.“It is such a lucky find,” said Gosling. “The chancery case is known about among some Shakespeare scholars and is mentioned in some Shakespeare histories but they always seem to refer back to the 19th century discovery of the will.”Now the original is documented, catalogued and available to the public for the first time in more than a century.Explore more on these topicsWilliam ShakespeareNational ArchivesnewsShareReuse this content"

The final week has brought Kim Brandstrup and The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in the culmination of the choreographer’s project to bring the music of JS Bach to young people through dance.A small edition of the OAE, with 18 strings, three winds and keyboard, led by Margaret Faultless, was raised above the Usher Hall stage, transformed, with mirrored floor and back wall and benches to the side, into something like a shiny school gym. And it was indeed in a north London high school, where the orchestra is resident, that the larger works took shape, Bach’s Concerto for Two Violins and Brandenburg Concerto No 3 uniting the breakdancing skills of the young people and professional dancers already familiar with Brandstrup’s vocabulary.His instinct that the fusion would animate 300-year-old music is thrillingly justified, but it does place huge demands on the instrumentalists, who initially sounded a little insipid in Edinburgh’s big hall until the discreet amplification properly kicked in. This was necessarily “strict time” Bach, with no room for the improvisatory freedom expected in early music performance, and often all the better for that. The rigorous beat made familiar music new, and it was a more relaxed band that played the instrumental interludes between the choreography.View image in fullscreenExciting ... Breaking Bach.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianMusic from the Solo Cello Suites, played by Andrew Skidmore, soundtracked a trio and two solos, the last of them daringly slow but still recognisably hip-hop in its shapes. Those and much of the frontline precision were performed by regular Brandstrup associates including Tommy Franzen, Deavion Brown, Aurora Casatori and Elyse Renwick-Ashun. But it was the full ensemble work, where it was often impossible – and irrelevant – to distinguish between those dancers and the young recruits, that was most exciting, particularly the Brandenburg finale.Bean-bag seating in the stalls, the Usher Hall was packed to the rafters, with many young people in the audience for this one-night-only premiere. It was not perfect, with even the professional dancers sometimes out of position, but it was already exhilarating – and has the potential to be breathtaking.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalOrchestra of the Age of EnlightenmentFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Is this a sign of body positivity or something else entirely?Leah HarperThu 21 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 00.06 EDTShareThere are plenty of places where no one would bat an eyelid at the sight of a thong bikini; on a beach in Brazil or around the Love Island fire pit, visible butt cheeks are practically de rigueur. But my first sighting this year was not while surfing in Australia or sunbathing in the Caribbean, but at an open-water swimming spot, on a rainy day in Scotland.I should not have been surprised. Tiny swimwear is huge news this summer. It is no longer confined to sunny climes, but cropping up everywhere from lidos to leisure centres – and lochs, apparently.The trickle down from catwalks and influencers to holidaymakers and shoppers is notable. A search for “thong bikini” on Asos yields 187 results, ranging from high-leg styles, to side-tie, to tanga (somewhere between a thong and a standard brief), while high-street outlets includingH&M,CalzedoniaandZaraall have thong bikini bottoms in their collections. And, as with any trend, there are plenty of celebrity forerunners, including gymnastSimone Biles, modelHeidi Klum, actorSofía Vergaraand singerNicole Scherzinger. RapperLizzois a longtime fan.“I won’t lie, it was nerve-racking initially,” says Victoria, 29, who wore a thong bikini for the first time on a recent solo trip to Naples. As for many new converts, part of the appeal lay in the fact that she would be able to avoid the significant tan lines created by fuller coverage swimwear. “I saw thong bikinis everywhere and wished I could wear one. But then I thought about it and was like, it’s just a bum. Men wear those teeny-tiny trunks where you see everything, so why can’t I wear this? Plus, it was really comfy.”View image in fullscreenLove Island … it is no surprise to see thong bikinis in this year’s reality show.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockThe itsy-bitsy bikini revolution may have come to the fore this summer, but it has been rumbling for some time. In 2023, the New York Times declared that “more women are adopting the ‘less is more’ philosophy” when it comes to beachwear; the same year, fashion site Who What Wear called thong bikinis the “controversial swimwear trend you’ll see on every beach this summer”. In 2024, New Zealand site The Spinoff asked: “Why is every bikini bottom a thong now?”“I think we’ve moved into another age of body consciousness – a much more expressive moment,” says Shaun Cole, associate professor in fashion at the University of Southampton. “People are saying: ‘It’s my body and I can show it off in ways that I choose to, and if that involves wearing clothing that is sometimes deemed socially unacceptable then I’m going to do that.’”Gen Z, in particular, areless inclined to restrict themselvesto clothes deemed to be “flattering” – a term that has fallen spectacularly out of favour. Thong bikinis, once the preserve of those who conformed to a particular body type, are now being manufactured in a more inclusive range of sizes and marketed more diversely.“Women of all shapes and sizes are leaning into bolder cuts with real confidence as part of a wider cultural shift towards body positivity and self-expression, which is great to see,” says Aliya Wilkinson, founder of luxuryswimwear label Ôsalé. Her brand doesn’t yet offer thong styles, but she plans to introduce them in the future.“In the west, fashion has long found ways to augment the butt, to make it look bigger and put emphasis on this part of the female body,” says Roberta Sassatelli, professor of sociology at the University of Bologna and co-author ofBody and Gender. “This is perhaps because the butt is deemed to be very sensual but is not related to reproduction. Because it is totally related to pleasure, it feels more liberated.”The trend is reflected in the popularity of potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures, such asBrazilian butt lifts. Sculpting the perfect behind has also become something of a fitness obsession. In 2018,sports writer Anna Kesselnoted that “the emphasis on a firm, or ‘juicy’, bottom has now overtaken the flat stomach as the fitness holy grail in mainstream women’s health magazines”, with an increasing number of gym classes dedicated exclusively to the posterior. Seven years later, could it be that gym-goers are keen to display the results?View image in fullscreenBeachwear 1920s style … when baring nearly all was much less fashionable.Photograph: GraphicaArtis/Getty Images“I think the popularity of thong bikinis exists at the convergence of a focus on building glutes in the gym, a kind of exhibitionist creep in which the butt is one of the last frontiers that had remained mostly covered in public, and a greater cultural acceptance of a range of different body types,” says historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, author ofFit Nation. “The low-slung jeans of the early 2000s were certainly correlated with the age when flat abs workouts were all the rage.”Cole suggests there may be another reason why more people are choosing to wear less. “It could be linked to what’s been called the ‘pornification’ of culture and style,” he says, citingan idea put forward by fashion historian Pamela Church Gibson. “[It is] modelled on a style that has come out of pornography – at the points where pornography stars are dressed – which involves garments such as tiny bikinis or thong-style underwear. There’s an acceptance of that style without people really realising where it originated. The popularity of shows such as Love Island, where people are there to show off their bodies as a way of attracting a partner, again ties to that pornification of style.”After years of falling audience figures, Love Island is also experiencing a boom this summer: increased numbers tuned in to watchthe UKandUS versions, with the New York Times attributing the popularity of the latter to its ability to offer reprieve during “times of societal and economic hardship”.View image in fullscreenCelebrity sightings are not unusual … Brazilian model Isabeli Fontana in Cannes in 2022.Photograph: Pepe Mendez/GC ImagesAs dress and design historian Amber Butchart put it when curating Splash!, a recent exhibition on swimming and style at the Design Museum in London: “Swimwear’s close relationship with the body means it reflects changing attitudes to modesty, morality and public display. From the 18th century, bathing machines were used to protect sea dippers from prying eyes. But throughout the 20th century, a number of boundary-pushing designs challenged previous ideas of decency while also courting controversy. For the last century, what we wear while swimming has been used as an excuse to police bodies.”While it is predominantly women who are opting for poolside thongs today, this wasn’t always the case. The earliest iteration of the style isthought to be the ancient loincloth, worn by men. Modern thongs are said to have been adopted in 1939, when the mayor of New York, Fiorello La Guardia, ordered that showgirls must cover themselves rather than perform nude at the city’s World’s Fair. When it comes to swimwear specifically, Austrian-American Rudi Gernreich – the fashion designer behind the monokini, or “topless bikini” – is most often credited with creating the thong bikini, in response to Los Angeles city council banning public nudity, including naked sunbathing, in 1974.The thong bikini has prompted similar bans more recently. In January, a council in Greater Sydney, Australia,banned thong and (even skimpier) G-string bikinisat its public pools. A number of women have also been arrested for wearing thong bikinis in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where the style is banned. In the UK, Greenwich Leisure Ltd, which operates 240 leisure centres under the brand Better, requires swimmers to wear “full-coverage bikinis”, which a spokesperson previously indicated did imply “that thongs wouldn’t be acceptable”.But even when thong styles are not prohibited, many bikini-wearers remain nervous. “I do own one, but it’s only been worn once, when my partner and I had a private villa in Portugal,” says Rebecca, 33. Even then, she says, she felt a little too exposed. “I don’t understand why someone would wear one on a family holiday, for example. Thong bikinis feel quite sexualised, so to me it seems inappropriate. Give me high-waisted bikini bottoms that cover your cheeks any day.”For Sassatelli, the reason thong bikinis are in vogue is not so surprising. “The thong has never gone away completely,” she says. “But for people who are in their teens and 20s, they haven’t really been ‘in fashion’. Once [the fashion industry] has forgotten something, then it can be recuperated – and it makes for a little sense of novelty.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's swimwearWomenFitnessSwimmingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Who should stop kicking up a stink?Find out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 21 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 13.50 EDTShareThe prosecution: RasheedaThe smell is intense, persistent and makes me nauseous. If she knows I hate it, she should stopMy friend and flatmate Farrah loves incense, but I hate it. I knew it was going to be a problem when I moved into her flat 18 months ago, and she was walking around “sageing” the rooms for “energy-cleansing”. I said: “What the hell are you doing?”Whenever I came home, Farrah would have incense sticks burning. I asked her to not do it when I was at home and she agreed. But because she works from home and still burns it while I’m out, I’m hit by a wall of thick smoke when I come back from work. The smell really lingers throughout the whole flat.I still feel annoyed, so our agreement isn’t really working. Burning incense isn’t like lighting a scented candle. It’s heavy, persistent and strong. Incense clings to fabrics, stays in the air, and for people with sensitive sinuses (like me) it causes headaches and nausea. I also think it affects the vibe of a shared space.Farrah says it’s for the “ambience”, but it ruins it for me. She’s Muslim – as am I – from an Egyptian background, and grew up with incense at home, but I don’t think it’s insensitive to ask her not to burn it around me.I’m not saying Farrah’s trying to kill us slowly, but when she’s burning it several times a week, it becomes my problem tooShe’s offered to try some sticks with a different scent, but they all smell the same to me, like burnt wood. I also find it triggering because the smell reminds me of a really tough time in my life when my cousin was using weed heavily while I lived with him. The smell makes me feel anxious, not calm.Plus, I read that too much incense burning makes the air quality in your space worse. I’m not saying Farrah’s trying to kill us slowly, but when she’s burning it several times a week in shared air, it becomes my problem too.We’ve been mates for years but, until we lived together, I didn’t know how incense-mad Farrah was.I’ve suggested essential-oil diffusers and candles, but she says they don’t have the same impact. I’ve told her that’s exactly the point, and we are kind of at a stalemate now. I just don’t think anyone should be continuously subjected to smells they find unpleasant in their own home.The defence: FarrahI open windows and don’t burn it when Rasheeda’s home. Stopping entirely isn’t a compromiseFor me, incense is cultural, spiritual and emotional. I grew up with my mum lighting it all the time, and it reminds me of warmth and protection.At the moment, I’m only burning it when Rasheeda isn’t around, or when I’m in my room. I don’t want Rasheeda to feel uncomfortable, but I am sticking to the rule she suggested, so I’m not doing anything wrong.The incense I use isn’t overpowering, and I make sure the windows are open so there’s airflow. It helps keep the flat smelling fresh. I don’t want to use candles, essential oils or sprays as they don’t have the same effect.Also, both of us contribute our own “notes” to the atmosphere. I don’t say anything when Rasheeda leaves her sweaty gym stuff in a laundry basket in the kitchen. Compared to that, my sandalwood and myrrh are really nice.We living in close quarters … sometimes we have to hear each other’s music or smell each other’s cooking – that’s lifeIt’s my home too. In fact, Rasheeda only moved in when my old flatmate moved out, so why should I have to completely change my lifestyle? I was happy to have her because we’ve been friends since we were about 25, after meeting at work (we’re 32 now).I’ve lived here for three years and Rasheeda moved in 18 months ago.I’ve asked her which scents don’t bother her, and said I could switch to those in communal areas. But banning incense entirely feels extreme and unfair to me. We’re living in close quarters, which I like, but that means sometimes we’ll hear each other’s music, smell each other’s cooking, or have to deal with each other’s quirks – that’s life. The incense doesn’t linger for hours like she says and I’m not burning it all day. I work from home, and only use it now and again.I think incense helps calm the energy of our home. I like being in an environment that smells familiar, soothing and culturally resonant as it helps me decompress.Rasheeda’s feelings are valid, but so are mine. I’m not trying to force incense on her, and I’m happy to compromise, maybe by having a schedule, choosing lighter scents or sticking to certain times of day. But our home should reflect both of us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

To then assume Farrah would totally remake her lifestyle is nothing short of bizarre. Time to move on – and out!Stuart, 76Smoke of any kind is heavy in particulates that trigger asthma and chronic conditions like migraines. Rasheeda is correct in ruling it out to protect the health of both tenants and visitors. (It makes me nauseous; I won’t enter shops that use it.)Pamela, 71Rasheeda chose to move in with Farrah, so should be prepared to compromise. Farrah has modified her incense use, but as Rasheeda still complains I suggest Farrah burns scented candles in the shared spaces before Rasheeda gets home to neutralise the incense odours. (And wouldn’t the bathroom a more appropriate place for a laundry basket?)Carrie, 69One presumes Rasheeda visited the flat prior to moving in, and noticed the “wall of thick smoke” then? Perhaps Farrah could refrain from burning incense for an hour or two before Rasheeda comes home, but it sounds like Rasheeda won’t be happy until the incense has been eradicated completely.Robbie, 55When you flat share you need to consider each other’s needs: the noise, cleanliness, strong smells – anything that impacts on the other’s quality of life.

For most of my life, this arcing coastal stretch of East Anglia was somewhere I had never visited, nor ever spent that much time thinking about; a span of English countryside that I mostly associated withAlan Partridge, Colman’s mustard and, in the context of my south London home, an awkward schlep. But then, almost exactly a decade ago, I stumbled through an internet rabbit hole on to an entry for a clutch of self-catering cottages in a seaside village near the gently bougie, wax-jacketed market town of Holt. Decision made.Soon we were rumbling out across an impossibly wide and flat expanse, bound for the ripe, blustering winds and billowing steam trains of a varied network of time-warp beaches and little towns. Not expecting much, and yet falling a little more in love with each passing moment and meal, with each glistening fistful of perfect chips fromNo1 Cromeror a tea room crab roll after watching seals nose out of the water at Blakeney Point.The arrival of a second kid, pandemic lockdowns and juddering personal and professional life shifts – all of these significant markers across the past 10 years have been punctuated by repeat trips to this understatedly beautiful strip of once-alien coastline. And though we have seen this part of the world in many different modes, the phrase that best crystallises my associative excitement is this: samphire season. I had definitely eaten and enjoyed the spindly green sea vegetable before our north Norfolk years, but I don’t think it was until we visited in summer, when samphire is at its abundant, fleeting peak in the tidal mudflats that gird the shoreline, that I appreciated its connection to East Anglian culinary culture, or how special it is when sampled at the source. When summer hits, this briny, delicately beaded marsh grass (locally pronounced more like “sam-fer”) is a comforting ubiquity, lurking on restaurant blackboards, in fishmonger window displays and in the DIY honesty boxes that ornament the wending coastal roads. There is a core memory from a few years ago: sticky-fingered, sandy kids in the car, and my wife Madeleinerunning from the passenger side to procure one of the last paper bags of foraged samphire from a roadside table amid the marshy, glimmering swelter of a little village called Salthouse.An improvisatory hodge-podge back in the holiday cottage kitchen yielded butter-fried new potatoes and samphire, alongside vegetarian chorizo sausages: a deeply weird but extraordinarily effective combination in which the waxy starch and fatty, paprika spicing somehow both muffle and complement the salinity of those nobbled green tufts. In the intervening years, I have evolved and refined the pleasure of that moment into a loose recipe, with the helpful lubrication of a potato salad dressing and an optional lily-gilding of fatty fish.Chop 200g chorizo (vegetarian or vegan, if preferred) into hunks and roast in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 15-20 minutes, until cooked through and golden. Meanwhile, boil 500g good, skin-on small potatoes in a pan of scantly salted simmering water for about 10 minutes, or until they just slip off the tip of a knife, adding 150g samphire for the last two to three minutes of cooking. Drain, halve the potatoes, if need be, and leave to steam dry.Make a simple vinaigrette with three tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, a tablespoon of white-wine vinegar, a little salt and pepper (remember to hold back on the salt), a teaspoon of sugar for balance, and a generous, emulsifying dollop of dijon mustard, then dress the potatoes and samphire while they’re still warm. Separately, mix three or four generous tablespoons of very good mayonnaise (I like an elegant, faint cloaking, rather than something too gloopy; again, go vegan, if required) with three chopped spring onions, some chopped capers and cornichons, parsley and dill, then stir into the cooled veg. Serve with the contrasting warmth of the roast chorizo and, if it appeals and you’re not going plant-based, two fillets of fresh mackerel, fried for just two or three minutes on each side.Creaminess and smoky heat; succulent, marine crunch and herbal freshness. Samphire is an underrated vegetable lightly reframed, a celebration of precious high summer, of hyper-seasonality, and a reminder of how, against the odds, a British-Nigerian city boy fell hard for this sleepy stretch of Partridge country.Picky by Jimi Famurewa, is published by Hodder & Stoughton at £20.

People walk slowly between two dense hedges of windfallen oak branches, or stand silently in a fragile cage of bulrush stems with light seeping through the mossy skylight overhead. I’m visiting the largest ever indoor exhibition ofwork by Andy Goldsworthy, one of Britain’s most influential nature artists. His recent installations have a visceral sense of rural landscape: hare’s blood on paper, sheep shit on canvas, rusty barbed wire, stained wool, cracked clay.The show is a sensory celebration of earth – its textures and temperatures, colours, character. The seasons cycle through an ongoing multidecade series of photos featuring the same fallen elm. There are leaf patterns and delicate woven branches, crusts of snow, lines of summer foxglove flowers or autumn rosehips. Andy Goldsworthy: Fifty Years is a National Galleries of Scotland (NGS) exhibition in the neoclassical Royal Scottish Academy building.View image in fullscreenBarbara Hepworth’s Ascending Form (Gloria) at the Royal Botanic Garden.Photograph: Antonia ReeveAfter the exhibition, as a sort of cultural pilgrimage, I’m walkingsix miles across Edinburghin search of works by the Dumfriesshire-based Goldsworthy and other artists who engage with the landscape. I start at the Royal Botanic Garden (free and open daily,rbge.org.uk), a short bus ride north of the National Gallery. Just inside the east gate, there’s aperforated sculpture by Barbara Hepworthwith sunlight pouring through it.“Art has made me look at the world … and engage with what’s around me,” Goldsworthy writes in the notes for Fifty Years. Walking up through shady beeches, blazing wildflowers and scented, bee-buzzing lavender, there’s a bronze girl in a waterlily pond, and a sundial by the Scottish artist and writer Ian Hamilton Finlay near the terrace cafe. Finlay’s best-known artwork is the garden he created with his wife, Sue, in the wild Pentland Hills (£15 over-16s, £10 for 10-15s, under-10s free, open Thursday to Sunday until 28 September,littlesparta.org.uk). He also built a stone temple in the rolling, wooded acres ofJupiter Artland, a few miles from Edinburgh, where Goldsworthy has put rocks in trees and trees in a stone-walled barn (£11.80 adults, £7.50 children).

TheWater of Leith Walkwayruns close to the John Hope Gateway on Arboretum Place, and I follow it south-westwards. In Stockbridge, the Sunday market, shaded by whitebeam trees, offers loaves of artisanal bread, Perthshire strawberries andcakes made from insects. Almost hidden in branches under a bridge, a lifesize cast-iron figure stands in the river nearby, one ofAntony Gormley’s 6 Times statues.View image in fullscreenStone Coppice by Andy Goldsworthy at Jupiter Artland.Photograph: FocusCulture/AlamyAnother of the figures is buried chest-deep by the zebra crossing betweenNational Galleries Scotland: Modern One and Two. Wandering past domed St Bernard’s Well, with its statue of the goddess of health, and picturesque Dean Village, crammed with fellow camera-wielding visitors, I detour to the Modern galleries up the riverside steps. Linking both museums is Charles Jencks’ hugeLandform, with its grassy hills and curving pond. There are days’ worth of galleries, artists’ rooms and sculpture gardens to explore here, but the afternoon is passing and I have more miles and museums to cover.Heading back along the leafy Water of Leith, I climb another steep flight of steps towards Haymarket. On the south lawn ofSt Mary’s Episcopal Cathedral, a labyrinth winds through aromatic yarrow and knapweed. Around this flowering meadow, as part of an installation calledOn Sacred Ground, there are rough benches elegiacally listing threatened Scottish species: corncrake, hawfinch, wryneck, ring ouzel, capercaillie. I walk on throughPrinces Street Gardens, back past the Royal Academy building, and drop into theNational Gallery(free) next door to see Van Gogh’s impasto Olive Trees and William McTaggart’s stormy seascapes.View image in fullscreenOne of Antony Gormley’s 6 Times statues in the Water of Leith.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAUp more steps, pausing to look back at distant views of the firth, and then down again across photogenic Victoria Street. Finally, I stroll through Greyfriars Kirkyard to reach the National Museum of Scotland (free,nms.ac.uk). In 1998, Goldsworthy installed four sunset-coloured blocks of split sandstone on themuseum roof, with its panoramic city views. But the blue skies have turned stormy. “Our roof terrace is closed today – the weather is too dreich!” says a red sign by the lift.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among the crowds are buskers, jugglers, unicyclists. With just one night to sample its anarchic offerings, I plunge into dodgy cabarets and sweaty comedies in tiny underventilated venues. At 9pm, I’m back at the National Museum for an accomplished Lloyd-Webber-esquemusical about Van Gogh. Towards midnight, I head to Summerhall for a strange, polyphonicprequel to Hamletby the Polish choral-theatre group Song of the Goat.The next day, as I walk to Edinburgh’s Waverley station, there’s a prismatic haze caught between the misty drizzle and breezy summer sun. It reminds me of Goldsworthy’s 1980s photo series with titles likeRainbow Splash Hit Water With Heavy Stick Bright, Sunny, Windy. As the train speeds south, through Northumberland and North Yorkshire, I see with new eyes the wave-pounded cliffs and bale-studded headlands, the dry-stone walls and sheep-scattered patchwork dales.The trip wasprovided byVisit Scotland,NGSandLNER,(York to Edinburgh from £23 each way,London to Edinburgh from £52).

Businesses close and the city nearly grinds to a halt. Among those who remain, there is an eternal, quintessentially Parisian quest: hunting for a balmyterrassebathed in sunlight for an evening apéritif.Finding the perfect seat on the pavement outside a cafe may be a matter of a chance stroll or a timely text from a friend. This summer, though, a digital solution has gained popularity in an extremely French instance of the old Apple slogan “there’s an app for that”: Jveuxdusoleil, an app that tracks the sun’s movement through the city’s maze of buildings to pinpoint exactly where you can claim a sunny spot on a terrace for your coffee. It arrives at a precarious moment for this particularly Parisian pursuit.‘Own less, have more’: French app rents out underused household itemsRead moreJean-Charles Levenne created Jveuxdusoleil (“I want sun”) in 2020 as a side project in an effort to teach himself app development and solve a personal problem: finding shade during hot days as well as sunny spots for the Parisian ritual of post-work drinks.Using sun-positioning algorithms and building-height data from the open-source map platform OpenStreetMap, Levenne’s app displays sunny terraces, while darkened ones disappear. Users can also request new spots through the app or note when it is not accurate (a tree casting a previously unaccounted for shadow, for example), making it a constantly evolving, community-driven tool. While the technology is working in other cities, most of the terraces on the app are located in Paris, where Levenne says it is particularly useful.“This app is working worldwide but it has originally been focused on Paris because there is more need than in other French cities,” he said. “With narrow streets and tall buildings, it’s not always easy to find a sunny spot.”Terraces function as observation posts from which to view Paris – chairs are often positioned on either side of the small bistro tables, facing the street rather than each other and allowing diners to observe the world passing by. With France’s lack of tipping culture, there is less pressure to quickly turn over tables to make more profit. One could order a single cup of espresso for less than €2 and stay for hours – making the terrace something of a second living room for Parisians.Pierrick Bourgault, a photographer and journalist who has written about 20 books and releaseda documentaryabout bistro culture in France, said terraces in Paris offer one of the most authentic windows into the city.“The terrace is emblematic of a certainart de vivre[art of living], as we say in France – a place where all kinds of people meet,” Bourgault said. “You’re not alone in an enclosed space. It’s a bit like [being in] the street, with one foot inside and one foot outside. You’re immersed in the city, and the spectacle of life.”In search of sun after the darkest winter in decadesJveuxdusoleil’s user base has climbed steadily in the years since its launch – with more than 1,300 active users in the week preceding my interview with Levenne, who has departed the tech world and called me from a yacht he now captains in the Balearic islands off the coast of Spain. App usage spikes in the spring, when Parisians are desperate for sunlight after the notoriously dreary winter months.This year, Jveuxdusoleil saw a peak of almost 20,000 visitors in just one week in early March after France experienced thedarkest year in 30 yearsin 2024. Paris in particular enduredmultiple stretchesof nearly a week at a time without a single ray of sunshine during the winter months. Jveuxdusoleil is entirely a passion project, and Levenne makes no profit from it. “In fact, it costs me money to host the servers,” he said.A Paris-based photographer I spoke with, who uses the app both to find sunny streets for shooting and terraces to enjoy drinks with friends, said the uncomplicated nature of Jveuxdusoleil is part of its appeal. Its features are minimal: with just one slider that determines time and sunlight, it positions itself as a kind of anti-everything app.Can an app revive decliningterrasseculture?While usership of Jveuxdusoleil is not necessarily widespread – many young French people I spoke with on the terraces of Paris had never heard of the app – its existence indicates a technological embrace of bistro culture in France at a crucial time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The document also stated that in Paris the number of bistros has declined from 5,000-6,000 in the 1970s-80s to just over 1,000 today. A coalition of French bistro ownerssuccessfully securednational recognition in September 2024. They have similarlybeen campaigning since 2018for Unesco World Heritage status for their establishments.Bourgault attributes this “massacre”, which has decreased the density of bistros in France over the last century from one cafe per 100 inhabitants to one per 2,000, to a barrage of continuing threats. The rise of automobiles and highways has diverted traffic from such establishments across the country, while television, smartphones and digital communications have replaced the need to meet friends at the local terrace. The report by bistro owners likewise cites globalization and changing consumer preferences as risks to bistro culture.Unconventional dating app Feeld reports surge in ‘vanilla tourists’Read moreA 1941 law prohibits new cafe creation and only allows takeovers of existing licenses, keeping the number of bistros relatively stagnant while soaring real estate prices, particularly in Paris, have made both running and patronizing these establishments less financially viable. French commentators have long lamented the “Americanisation of Paris”, withsome notingthat, as more traditional bistros close, McDonald’s is spreading quickly across France and becoming a de facto meeting place for many young people.Bourgault said the rise of technology has contributed to the decline of bistros; people can order delivery on their phones, and when they do go out they often stay glued to their devices instead of chatting with strangers at thecomptoir. It’s ironic then, he noted, that an app could in fact strengthen the bistro culture of Paris.“With its geographical visualization, the app situates you in the concrete world – it reminds us that we’re on earth, it reminds us that there’s a sun that moves, the earth that turns,” he said.“When we meet friends at a bistro for a drink, we aren’t meeting in the cloud – we are meeting in a cafe with distinct personality, characters and decor,” he added. “We know we are not two artificial intelligences [in the process] of exchanging digital protocols. We talk to each other, and without a shadow of a doubt, we know it is real.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyFrance (World news)France (Weather)EuropeEurope holidaysnewsShareReuse this content"

Thankfully, Raymond Martin is fighting backThu 21 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTShareThe first thing Raymond Martin looks for in a toilet, he says, is cleanliness. Does the tissue paper on the floor mean this public lavatory has failed his inspection? “You have to understand that it’s a working toilet, it’s now mid-afternoon – a few bits of tissue on the floor is neither here nor there,” Martin says. “If there were cigarette packets, bottles on the floor – that I’d be worried about.” We’re in Knutsford, Cheshire, and Martin is on a toilet-inspection tour of the north and west of the UK. He’s just come from the Lake District and Blackpool. When we part ways in a couple of hours, he’ll head on to Wales to inspect the public conveniences of Pembrokeshire.Do people laugh when Martin, who is managing director of the British Toilet Association (BTA), tells them he does toilet inspections? They do, he says. “But then, immediately, they say, ‘I’ll tell you where I was and they had wonderful toilets …’.”Martin loves the job – it takes him all over the country. And he really, really loves loos. He turns 70 this year and has started thinking about who may run the BTA whenever he steps down. He is, he says, “trying to find someone who has the passion for toilets”. But before then, Martin is on what he calls his quest. “God or whoever said, ‘We need somebody to do this job.’ And I went, ‘All right, I’ll give it a go.’” Martin wants everyone to be able to use clean, safe and accessible public loos. Rather than a nice-to-have “convenience”, he sees toilets as an essential part of public infrastructure.The BTA is a members’ association, funded by companies including those that design and build public toilets, so it’s clearly in their commercial interests to have more public conveniences – but it’s in our interests too. Since 2000, Raymond says the UK has lost about 50% of its public toilets. The figure is closer to 35%, according to Jo-Anne Bichard and Gail Ramster, accessible design researchers and authors of the book Designing Inclusive Public Toilets: Wee The People. (They have also created aToilet Mapof the UK’s public loos.)View image in fullscreen‘It’s about helping people, health and wellbeing, equality’ … Raymond Martin in his company car.Photograph: Charles McQuillan/The GuardianA lack of toilets affects all of us, but especially those with disabilities, older people and those with chronic illness, including bowel and bladder problems. People have described not drinking enough (so as not to be caught short), soiling themselves in public, or not going out at all – the “urinary leash” that keeps people trapped at home if they don’t know if they’ll be able to access a loo. “It’s about sanitation and hygiene,” says Martin about his passion for public loos. “It’s about helping people, health and wellbeing, equality, and it’s just about making things right.” Does he dream about toilets? He laughs. “Yes, I have to admit it.”When the Con-Lib coalition government introduced austerity in 2010 and cut councils’ budgets, one of the first things many of them did to save money was close public loos. Since the BTA was set up in 1999, it has been trying to get the government to take toilets seriously (it also campaigns on other issues, such as the provision of sanitary bins in male toilets, and keeping an eye on loo-related issues, including schools restricting access during lessons).After the Covid pandemic, many of the toilets that were closed never reopened. When the levelling up and regeneration bill was announced, and a “toilet tsar” was suggested to oversee public convenience provision, the Conservatives rejected it. “[They said] nobody wants to be the Minister for Poo. Nobody wants to be the toilet minister.”Martin has more faith in the current government. Last year, he was invited to speak to Alex Norris, minister for building safety, fire and local growth. He took about 20 colleagues and partners, including representatives from disability groups and trade unions, to talk toilets – and he was back again three months ago. He hopes the government will make public loos a statutory requirement for councils (and provide the funding for it). “The government’s very keen on safer, cleaner neighbourhoods, social inclusion and interaction, and rebuilding towns,” says Martin. “Toilets are an absolutely essential part of this.” Martin is confident for the first time in years that public loos will finally become obligatory.View image in fullscreenA closed public toilet in Avonmouth, Bristol.Photograph: Paul Hennell/AlamyOver the course of a year, Martin will leave his home in Bangor, Northern Ireland, and visit about 600 toilets, including those in supermarkets and in pub chains such as Wetherspoon’s, to check their condition, but also to give feedback on how they can be improved. This week, he will visit a random selection of nearly 50 public loos run by the company Danfo.In one car park in Knutsford, there are three single toilets – “unisex cubicles are the way to go”, says Martin – including an accessible one, which we look at first. “Number one: how easy the door is to open,” he says. During our afternoon together, I notice he often says “number one”, but doesn’t always follow it up with a “number two” – but number ones, I suppose, are more common. He has a large number of checks to do, including the number of rails inside; that they’re in the right position, and there’s enough space for a wheelchair to turn. But the seat is about 2cm too low to be easily sat on by a wheelchair-user. “We’ll make that recommendation to them.”A shelf would be useful, particularly for people changing a colostomy bag. Martin pulls the baby changing table down. “You’re looking for stability,” he says. “And sides so the child can’t roll off it. Somebody’s been in here, look.” There are strands of tobacco on the table – the sign, he says, of someone rolling a joint. Sometimes, people will use the changing table for lines of cocaine, he adds. “Then you put a baby … It’s something we have to be aware of.” There is a sharps disposal hole, but cleaners still have to be aware that needles may have been hidden behind toilets. “Prick injuries, putting your hand around the back of the toilet to clean it.”Working and clean and serviceable … that’s my favourite kind of toiletThe built-in metal sink and dryer is in working order and virtually spotless, and there are two coat hooks: good. “The mirror is clean as a whistle. Lighting is good.” He sniffs. “No odour. It’s very hard to make this much better for a public toilet.” He’ll give it four stars – a grading system he has invented. “I’m trying to perfect it.” What might have pushed that up to a five? Perhaps a sanitiser for the seat, he says, “because you don’t know whose bum’s been on that last”. And one of the handrails could be screwed in a bit tighter, he adds.In the small cafe next door, over coffee, Martin explains one way councils could pay for public loos. “You have a council toilet, but you have a coffee shop on the back of it, so these two work in symbiosis,” he says. “The rent from here will offset the cost of the toilets. You take a block of toilets, cut it in half, you put a shop in one side, and you put unisex cubicles in the other side. Around the country, we’re now starting to see things like coffee shops, tourist information centres … I think in one place there’s an art gallery.” As well as the government making toilets an essential, and providing money, “we also need to think about these new ideas, and community groups [running loos]”.Martin can trace his interest in lavatories back to his time at school in the 60s, and a history teacher warning that one of the biggest threats to humanity was a pandemic, or antibiotic resistant germs. The importance of sanitation lodged in his mind, says Martin. As an adult, he went into sales, dealing in home appliances, then electronics, working his way up. But his life was about to collapse.When Martin was 32, his wife died four days after giving birth to their second daughter. Years later, he discovered his wife had OTC deficiency, a rare genetic condition that affects how the body removes ammonia. (It also explained the earlier death, at two days old, of their first child.) “The doctors didn’t even know at that time,” he says. Martin was left with a one-and-a-half-year-old daughter, and a newborn to look after. “There were very difficult times for a lot of years,” he says, but he adds that he had a lot of support – nannies, a good friend and his family.View image in fullscreen‘Toilets are about health and wellbeing, but they’re also about the local economy.’Photograph: Charles McQuillan/The GuardianWhen his daughters were children, Martin became even more focused on hygiene and cleanliness, he says. As a single father, taking the girls to the loo was difficult. “I spent my time searching for toilets, and looking at toilets and going in and checking if they were all right to be used. The men’s toilets were despicable, in most cases.” He would often stand outside the women’s loos, which were the only facilities to have baby changing tables, then choose his moment to ask if he could go inside. “The next thing would be [a woman would say]: ‘Here, this bloke is going to change a baby’s nappy. Do you see this?’ I’d have a crowd around me.” This was 40 years ago, he says, when men were not really expected to do such things. Years later, he was, he says, “one of the big drivers who got baby change tables in men’s toilets, and we’d like to see a lot more.”In the early 90s, Martin started working for the campaign organisation Keep Britain Tidy. While assessing the cleanliness of beaches for Blue Flag status, he became even more interested in lavatories. “To get a blue flag, you expected toilets for visitors and you had to look after them,” he says. He became so recognised as a loo expert that he started working for the BTA in 2002, doing surveys for them at first, before taking over as managing director in 2014. It’s a voluntary role, though he gets paid for the surveys and consultations.In that time, Martin has watched public toilets go down the pan. He understands the pressures – it costs about £15,000 a year to run a small block of toilets, he says – but says the money-saving was shortsighted as it meant town centres, and the businesses in them, started to suffer. “Toilets have a twin effect. Number one, it’s about health and wellbeing. But they’re also about the local economy.”If we want to have thriving town centres, we need public loos, he says. The schemes where councils partner with local businesses to open their toilets to the public only go so far. “A shop opens at 9am, closes at 5pm. What do you do from 6am, when runners are out, dog walkers, postal workers, delivery drivers? What about the evening, when people want to go out? So you have to have council provision as well.” Truckers and delivery drivers shouldn’t have to urinate in bottles. “We know it happens – but it shouldn’t happen in a modern society.”View image in fullscreenMore kaput commodes in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales.Photograph: Jeff Morgan 14/AlamyThe public loos in Knutsford charge 30p. It’s partly to pay towards the cost of upkeep, but it also reduces vandalism, says Martin. “Somehow we’ve got to get people to respect toilets. I don’t think they realise when they’re doing it, the effect [toilet closure is having] on older people, people with severe disabilities.” Are people open to paying? “No, is the answer. We all expect free toilets. I actually think they should be free, but reality sets in, and costs have gone up and we’ve got to fund them.”We go across town to visit another set of public loos, which look great to my untrained eye. “Now, the criticism here is the white rails, because people with partial sight could have trouble seeing them,” says Martin. They should have had a band of dark tape put on them, for visibility. The rails on the baby change table could be higher, and the sink could be lower, but otherwise, Martin is happy. Four stars!In his chatty way, Martin has been talking toilets for hours, from the lavatories shown at the 1851 Great Exhibition to the new glass cubicles Japan has introduced for its public toilets, to his hope that the UK will host the World Toilet Summit next year. On his tours of the UK’s toilets, are there ones that stick in his mind? Does he have a favourite? “If they’re working and clean and serviceable,” he says “that’s my favourite kind of toilet.”Explore more on these topicsSocietyLocal governmentInfrastructureHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He did not say whether Uganda was receiving any payment or other benefits and how many deportees it would accept.“Uganda also prefers that individuals from African countries shall be the ones transferred to Uganda. The two parties are working out the detailed modalities on how the agreement shall be implemented,” Bagiire Vincent Waiswa said.The government of the east African country is the latest to strike a deal with the US, which is seeking to expel millions of undocumented migrants, asylum seekers and foreigners with criminal convictions or more minor legal infractions on their record.In July, five migrants from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba, who Washington said had been convicted of serious crimes, were flown to Eswatini, where they are now in a high security prison. The deportations are beingchallengedby a group of Swazi and southern African NGOs, with a high court hearing scheduled for Friday.Also in July, eight men from various countries were deported by the USto South Sudan, via Djibouti, where they were held for weeks in a shipping container. Meanwhile, more than 250 Venezuelans wererepatriated to Venezuelaafter being sent to a notorious El Salvador prison in March without due process.Meanwhile, Rwanda has said it will take in 250 people deported by the US.

His political opponents are regularly sent to jail.On Wednesday, a Ugandan official denied that it had reached a deal with the US, saying that they did not have the facilities and infrastructure to accommodate immigrants. The denial followed a CBS News story on Tuesday that cited internal government documents,reportingthat the White House had reached deportation deals with Honduras and Uganda.Godwin Toko, the deputy executive director of Agora, a Ugandan thinktank that promotes democracy and human rights said: “Uganda doesn’t have the cards, economically … in terms of military power or in any other sense. But Uganda can then play a good boy for the US and this is one of the avenues that the Ugandan government uses to gain leverage.”‘Controversy is always good fodder’: Uganda’s cartoonists turn their pens on president’s provocative sonRead moreUganda has a record of accepting migrants and asylum seekers deported by other countries.

A survivor of brutal and repeated sexual and domestic violence, she has the developmental age of a child.Limbu’s legal team is now worried about her deteriorating health. On a visit to the prison in June, one of her lawyers found that Limbu required assistance to walk, her stomach was swollen and her mental health had worsened. “She looked sick, weak and sad,” the lawyer said.In Tanzania, the death penalty is the mandatory sentence for murder. Limbu’s original conviction in 2015 was nullified in 2019 due to procedural errors. But she remained incarcerated awaiting a new trial.In 2022, she was retried and sentenced to death a second time. The court did not consider her intellectual disabilities or history of abuse. An appeal was filed in 2022 but no date for a hearing has been set.“The constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania requires courts to not delay dispensation of justice unreasonably,” said the lawyer. “According to our laws, justice should not only be done, but be seen to be done.”“This is a woman who absolutely should not be in prison,” said Prof Sandra Babcock, a clinical professor of law and the faculty director of the Cornell Center on the Death Penalty Worldwide, who is acting as a legal consultant in Limbu’s case.“This is a woman who is not violent, who represents no threat. You could release her tomorrow, and, as long as she had some kind of support for her disability, she would be able to live a reasonably productive life in society. She is somebody who needs protection.”A coalition of 24 African and international human rights groups earlier this year condemned Limbu’s sentence as part of an appeal to the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights to look at the plight of women on death row throughoutAfrica.Limbu grew up in an environment of violence. Her father beat her mother and she was repeatedly raped by men in her village, who would drag her from her home. She gave birth at 15 after becoming pregnant by rape.At about 18, she married an older man and had two more children. She later fled from her husband, who beat her, and moved to a different village with her youngest child, Tabu, who was about a year old.There she met Kijiji Nyamabu, an alcoholic, who told Limbu he would marry her – but he said he would never accept her baby daughter, Tabu, because she had been fathered by a different man.Shortly afterwards, Tabu was found strangled. There were no witnesses and Kijiji had already fled by the time Limbu brought the authorities to her daughter’s body. She was arrested in August 2011 but Kijiji was never detained.At her first trial in 2015, Limbu pleaded not guilty. Unable to read or write, she said she did not know the contents of a statement that police claimed she had made admitting to the murder. She said she was beaten, threatened at gunpoint and detained for two days at the police station.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The far-right populist faces more than four decades in prison if found guilty.Court documents made public on Wednesday nightshowed federal police investigators had found a draft asylum request on the ex-president’s mobile phone addressed to Argentina’s rightwing president, Javier Milei. In the undated and unsigned document, Bolsonaro claimed he was “facing imminent arrest”​ for political motives and needed “urgent” sanctuary overseas.An Argentinian government source told the Reuters news agency that Milei’s office had not received a letter. But Brazilian police claimed the document indicated Bolsonaro had “planned to flee the country, in order to prevent the law being enforced”.After the document was released as part of a 170-page police report, supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes demanded answers from Bolsonaro’s lawyers. “The evidence gathered by the federal police indicate that Jair Messias Bolsonaro was in possession of a document designed to enable him to escape national territory,” Moraes wrote in his dispatch.Bolsonaro, who was president from 2019 until the end of 2022, was placed under house arrest in early August after the supreme court decided he had violated a court order banning him from using social media. But Moraes’s 48-hour ultimatum reportedly fuelled fears among Bolsonaro supporters that their 70-year-old leader could be now taken into custody to stop him absconding before his final judgment, which is due to start on 2 September and conclude on 12 September.Bolsonaro’s lawyer, Paulo da Cunha Bueno, admitted that the idea of going to Argentina had been suggested to his client but that Bolsonaro had rejected it. “Fleeing was never an option,” he told journalists.Bolsonaro stands accused of plotting to overturn the result of the 2022 election, which he lost to his leftwing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. He denies those charges, but political and legal experts – and many of Bolsonaro’s allies – are convinced he will be convicted.The accusation that Bolsonaro had planned to flee Brazil for Argentina came as federal police formally accused the ex-president and his congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, of trying to interfere in Bolsonaro’s judgment by encouraging US officials to put pressure on the supreme court. If found guilty of that offence they could receive a sentence of up to 12 years.Eduardo Bolsonaro moved to the US in February and has spent recent monthslobbying Donald Trump’s administration– with some success – to pile pressure on Brazil’s supreme court justices and Lula’s government over his father’s trial.In July Trumpslapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian importsin retaliation for what he called a “witch-hunt” against Bolsonaro and announced the imposition of sanctions on Moraes, who is presiding over Bolsonaro’s trial.Eight of Brazil’s 11 supreme court judges, including Moraes, have beenstripped of their US visas, as have the wife and 10-year-old daughter of one of Lula’s closest allies, the health minister, Alexandre Padilha.“It’s really a political execution that they’re trying to do with Bolsonaro. I think that’s terrible,” Trump told reporters last week.In other developments during a dramatic 24 hours for Brazilian politics, Silas Malafaia, a powerful and wealthy evangelical pastor who is one of Bolsonaro’s most vocal cheerleaders, was questioned by police after flying back from Portugal to Rio.Malafaia, who is also being investigated by federal police over suspicions he too tried to influence the outcome of Bolsonaro’s trial, has now been banned from leaving the country and communicating with Bolsonaro and his son and has been ordered to surrender his passports. “You’ll have to arrest me to silence me,”Malafaia shouted at reportersafter being released.The federal police report also exposed the foul-mouthed infighting that appears to be playing out between members of the Bolsonaro clan and key supporters in the lead-up to the ex-president’s judgment.In one WhatsApp exchange found on Jair Bolsonaro’s phone, which was seized as part of police investigations, Eduardo Bolsonaro reacts to an interview in which his father criticised him, writing in all capitals: “Go and fuck yourself you fucking ingrate!”In another message, from Malafaia to Jair Bolsonaro, the firebrand church leader attacks Eduardo Bolsonaro for publicly celebrating Trump’s tariffs on Brazilian imports. “I’m sorry, president.

I’m fuming!”In a statement, Eduardo Bolsonaro criticised the police for “leaking private, absolutely normal conversations”. He called the move “shameful” and politically motivated and denied trying to interfere in his father’s trial.Polls suggest Lula has received a boost after Trump’s attempts to pressure Brazil’s institutions, with more than 70% of Brazilians opposed to the US president’s actions and only 21% supporting them. A poll released on Thursday showed Lula beating all of his potential rightwing rivals in next year’s election, including Bolsonaro’s wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, and a handful of conservative state governors battling to inherit leadership of Bolsonaro’s political movement.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In the report – which was reviewed by the Guardian – police said the document indicated he was planning to seek political asylum in Argentina, which is governed by his far-right ally Javier Milei.“In my country of origin I am being persecuted for essentially political reasons and crimes,” Bolsonaro’s alleged draft asylum request claims, describing the former president as “a politically persecuted person”.The undated and unsigned letter was addressed to “the most excellent president of Argentina Javier Gerardo Miliei [sic]”. It claimed Bolsonaro was “facing imminent arrest”​ – something the asylum request said would be “unjust, illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional”.An Argentine government source told the Reuters news agency that Milei’s office had not received a letter.Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil from 2019 until the end of 2022, insists he hopes to challenge Lula in next year’s presidential election, despite having already been barred from running by the supreme court for spreading disinformation. He is currently living under house arrest in the capital, Brasília, after the supreme court found he had violated a court order forbidding him from using social media.In their report to the supreme court, federal police alleged the letter indicated that Bolsonaro had “planned to flee the country, in order to prevent the law being enforced”.The accusation that Bolsonaro had planned to flee Brazil for Argentina came as federal police formally accused the ex-president and his congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, of trying to interfere in Bolsonaro’s upcoming judgment by encouraging US officials to pressure the supreme court. A formal accusation is a prelude to charges being brought. The judgement is due to start on 2 September and end on 12 September.Eduardo Bolsonaro moved to the US in February and has spent recent monthslobbying Donald Trump’s administration– with some success – to pile pressure on Brazil’s supreme court justices and President Lula’s government over his father’s trial.In July Trumpslapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian importsin retaliation for what he called a “witch-hunt” against Bolsonaro and announced sanctions against Alexandre de Moraes, the supreme court judge presiding over Bolsonaro’s trial.Eight of Brazil’s 11 supreme court judges, including Moraes, have been stripped of their US visas, as have the wife and 10-year-old daughter of one of Lula’s closest allies, the health minister Alexandre Padilha.“It’s really a political execution that they’re trying to do with Bolsonaro. I think that’s terrible,” Trump told reporters last week.In other developments on a dramatic day for Brazilian politics, Silas Malafaia, a powerful and wealthy evangelical pastor who is one of Bolsonaro’s most vocal cheerleaders, was questioned by police after flying back from Portugal to Rio.Malafaia, who is also being investigated by federal police over suspicions he too tried to influence the outcome of Bolsonaro’s trial, has now been banned from leaving the country, communicating with Bolsonaro and his son Eduardo and ordered to surrender his passports.The police report to the supreme court also exposed the foul-mouthed infighting that appears to be playing out between members of the Bolsonaro clan and key supporters in the lead-up to the conclusion of the ex-president’s judgment.In one WhatsApp exchange found on Jair Bolsonaro’s phone – which was seized as part of federal police investigations – Eduardo Bolsonaro reacts to an interview in which his father criticized him, writing in all capitals: “Go and fuck yourself you fucking ingrate!”In another message, from Malafaia to Jair Bolsonaro, the firebrand church leader attacks Eduardo Bolsonaro for publicly celebrating Trump’s tariffs on Brazilian imports. “I’m sorry, president. This son of yours Eduardo is an inexperienced prick who is handing the nationalist discourse to Lula and the left ... a complete idiot. I’m fuming!”In a statement, Eduardo Bolsonaro criticised the police for “leaking private, absolutely normal conversations”. He called the move “shameful” and politically motivated.Polls suggest Lula has received a boost in the polls after Trump’s attempts to pressure Brazil’s institutions, with more than 70% of Brazilians opposed to the US president’s actions and only 21% supporting them.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Last year, former prime minister Chris Hipkins was forced to bring abackup plane on a trip to Chinaover fears the plane he was travelling on was unreliable.The two new Airbus aircraft – set to replace the Boeing 757 planes – were long-range aircraft that could return safely from Antarctica if they were unable to land due to conditions on the ice, Collins said.The planes would be acquired on a six-year lease-to-buy arrangement and would be ready to use in 2028.The new maritime helicopters would ensure New Zealand fulfilled its objective of having a more integrated Anzac force and would be a more reliable option for the deployment of defence personnel, Collins said.The helicopter would be equipped with torpedos and missiles, which would “increase the lethality and defensive capability of New Zealand’s fleet”, she said.The foreign minister, Winston Peters, said the government’s investment showed it was responding to “the sharply deteriorating security environment”.“Global tensions are increasing rapidly and we must invest in our national security to ensure our economic prosperity.”New Zealand’s spy agency released a report on Thursday saying the country was facing its toughest national security challenges in recent times, with increasing threats of foreign interference and espionage,particularly from China.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The Kremlin said in a statement that Max, which will be integrated with government services, would be on a list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all “gadgets”, including mobile phones and tablets, sold inRussiafrom 1 September. The firm behind Max said this week that 18 million users had downloaded its app, parts of which are still in a testing phase.State media says accusations from Kremlin critics that Max is a spying app are false and that it has fewer permissions to access user data than rivals WhatsApp andTelegram.Russia restricts WhatsApp and Telegram, alleging apps used for fraud and terrorismRead moreIt will also be mandatory from 1 September for Russia’s domestic app store, RuStore, which is pre-installed on all Android devices, to be pre-installed on Apple devices. A Russian-language TV app called Lime HD TV, which allows people to watch state TV channels free of charge, will be pre-installed on all smart TVs sold inRussiafrom 1 January.The push to promote homegrown apps comes after Russia said this month it hadstarted restricting some calls on WhatsApp, owned byMeta Platforms, and on Telegram, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases.WhatsApp, which in July had a reach of 97.3 million users in Russia, responded by accusing Moscow of trying to block Russians from accessing secure communications, whileTelegram, which had a reach of 90.8 million users, said it actively combats the harmful use of its platform.The third most popular messenger app in July, according to Mediascope data, was VK Messenger, at 17.9 million users, an offering from the same state-controlled tech company VK which developed Max.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the majority were “very realistic applications”, Basan said.The two winners, both German professionals, will move into spacious furnished flats in the city centre in September and be treated to a red-carpet orientation programme.View image in fullscreenThe city was built around a steel plant soon after the second world war.Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The GuardianMelanie Henniger, a 49-year-old IT consultant and self-described “empty nester” living in the north-western city of Bremen, said she had grown up in nearby Frankfurt an der Oder and was interested in returning to her eastern roots.A free flat for a fortnight: the German city offering perks to fight depopulationRead more“This is a great chance to get to know the region again, because otherwise I wouldn’t have any opportunities at all as I don’t know anyone there any more,” she said. “In the best case scenario, I can put down new roots there again.”The other successful applicant, 39-year-old Jonas Brander, is a Berlin-based film-maker working on a documentary about Eisenhüttenstadt.“I’m very interested in the city and its people and I want to get very close to life in my work,” Brander said, adding that he was drawn to its “living history”.Eisenhüttenstadt, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary, was the first city to be founded – in east or west Germany – after the Nazi period. It was built according to a socialist model designed to blend work and family life for the good of all.But the years since national reunification in 1990 have been hard on the town, which has fewer than half the 53,000 residents it counted before the fall of the Berlin Wall.The shrinking and ageing population has compounded a skilled labour shortage for local industry, in what economists say can easily turn into a death spiral.A palpable sense of decline has spurred support for the far-rightAlternative für Deutschlandparty, which won nearly 40% of local votes in theFebruary general election.The strength of the anti-migrant, anti-Islam party in many east German regions is often cited as a deterrent to new residents, especially highly qualified people from abroad.However, Basan said the programme had allowed Eisenhüttenstadt to put its best foot forward, touting its renovated and affordable neoclassical housing, verdant surroundings perfect for swimming and cycling, and plentiful childcare and work opportunities.“We even had one family, from another European country, who heard about us via theProbewohnenprogramme and are moving here on their own steam. They’ve already signed a work contract with a local company,” she said.“They did it all themselves and we’re just thrilled.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Investigators do not believe he was one of the divers, but he is thought to have had a leading role as a coordinator of what appeared to have been a well-planned operation.The yacht was hired with the help of intermediaries and using forged identity papers, from a German company, according to prosecutors.The incident has been under investigation since 2022 by the GBA, which said it intended to charge any suspects with anti-constitutional sabotage and causing an explosion.During extensive media investigations, in particular by the news magazine Der Spiegel, people who allegedly had detailed knowledge of the incident said the commandos had not intended to commit a crime. Instead, they had considered it an attack on a legitimate military target due to Russia’s war onUkraine, not least because the profits from gas deliveries to Germany had contributed significantly to financing Moscow’s war.Spiegel’s research revealed evidence suggesting the action had been sanctioned by the Ukrainian armed forces, although this has been denied by Kyiv.German prosecutors have not said when they expect Serhiy K to be extradited to face German authorities.Separate investigations by Swedish and Danish authorities were closed in February 2024, leaving German authorities to continue their inquiries alone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another initial strong assumption was that the perpetrators were Russian – but investigators traced the yacht and discovered its connection to Ukraine.Like Kyiv, Washington and Moscow denied the allegations.Last year Germany’s federal prosecutor general, Jens Rommel, secured an initial arrest warrant against one of the suspected divers. However, the suspect left his home in Poland before he could be arrested after Polish authorities allegedly warned Ukrainian authorities in advance. The man is believed to have driven into Ukraine in a car with diplomatic licence plates, according to Spiegel.Separately on Thursday, the Georgian captain of an oil tanker that damaged undersea cables in the Baltic Sea in 2024 after his vessel dragged along the sea bed for about 55 miles has denied wrongdoing, calling the incident a “maritime accident”.Davit Vadatchkoria and the first and second officers of the Eagle S oil tanker are to face charges in a Helsinki court on Monday over the slicing of power and telecommunications cables as their vessel travelled westwards in the Gulf of Finland, having departed from a Russian oil port.“We are innocent. It’s only a maritime accident,” Vadatchkoria, who is being detained in Finland, told the Finnish public broadcaster YLE on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsItalyNord Stream 2 pipelineNord Stream 1 pipelineUkraineGermanyRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

US tariffs on EU cars will be lowered “from the first day of the same month in which the European Union’s legislative proposal is introduced”, it says, adding that the legislation must “be consistent with this Framework Agreement and enacted by the necessary legislatures”.European leaders have some reservations. Last month the French prime minister, François Bayrou, described “a dark day when an alliance of free peoples, united to affirm their values and defend their interests, resolves to submission”.And the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said at anews conferenceearlier this week: “I support this trade agreement, but I do so without any enthusiasm,” noting the deal would have a limited impact on Spain’s economy given its smaller exposure to the US market.On Thursday, industry leadersresponded with dismay.In 2024, the EU exported €8bn worth of alcohol, including €5bn of wine, to the US, its main export market. The French wine exporters federation said on Thursday it was “hugely disappointed” by the EU’s admission that it failed to secure a tariff exemption for the sector in the US-EU trade deal.“We are certain that this will create major difficulties for the wines and spirits sector,” the head of the wine and spirits federation FEVS, Gabriel Picard, said.France’s minister for trade, Laurent Saint-Martin, said the government would seek “additional exemptions” for wines and spirits as part of the US-EU trade deal. “The agreement leaves open the possibility for additional exemptions and we’ll be working on them. The story isn’t over,” he wrote on X, adding: “I’m not saying it will be easy or that it’ll happen next week … defending our exports remains our priority.”Christophe Chateau of the Bordeaux winemakers association, said the US was his members’ biggest market and the tariff would be a “further brake” on sales. However, he said he was relieved Trump had not carried out threats to tax imports of European wine at 200%. “It could have been worse, but it’s not good news,” he added.Before the announcement on Thursday, the Swiss chocolate makers Lindt and Swiss knife producers Victorinox announced they planned to move part of their production to the US to avoid tariffs on exports.The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States also criticized the deal, noting 15% tariffs on EU spirit imports to the US could result in an estimated retail loss of more than $1bn and 12,000 jobs. “We are disappointed that this joint statement did not include permanent tariff-free trade for distilled spirits on both sides of the Atlantic,” its president and CEO, Chris Swonger, said in a statement.Of the 27 EU member states, Germany exports most to the U.S. (€161bn last year) followed by Ireland (€71.3bn), Italy (€64.8bn), France (€47.1bn) and the Netherlands (€43.3bn) according to figures from the EU’s statistics agency Eurostat.Last month, the Italian Employers’ Study Centre, warned a 15% rate combined with a 13.5% devaluation of the dollar against the euro in 2025 would cause a €22.6bnbillion decline in the country’s exports to the US.“We are talking about 15%, but in reality the surcharge will be close to 30%,” Dario Costantini, president of the CNA (the national confederation of small and medium size businesses), said. “This is an unfair and disproportionate tax that penalises products made in Italy and will also have negative repercussions on the US economy.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropeTrump administrationDonald TrumpTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

It said to do so would “deprive more than 1 million people of their right to medical treatment and expose the lives of residents, patients and the wounded to imminent danger”.View image in fullscreenPeople carry the bodies of killed Palestinians into al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockOn Thursday evening, Benjamin Netanayhu announced during a visit to Israeli soldiers in the Gaza division that he had approved plans for the takeover of Gaza City and ordered officials to begin immediate negotiations over the return of Israeli hostages in Gaza.“We are in the decision-making stage,” the prime minister said. “I have come to the Gaza division today to approve the plans that the IDF presented to me … for the takeover of Gaza City and the defeat ofHamas... At the same time, I have instructed to begin immediate negotiations on the release of all our hostages and the end of the war on terms acceptable to Israel. These two things – the defeat of Hamas and the release of all our hostages – go hand in hand.”Netanyahu, who is wanted by the international criminal court over allegations of responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity, earlier told Sky News Australia that Israel intended to take over the whole of the Gaza Strip regardless of whether there was a ceasefire deal agreed with Hamas. The families of Israeli hostages have said such an operation would be a “death sentence” for their relatives.In the interview, apparently conducted earlier this week, he was asked whether Israel would take over all of Gaza, even if Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal. “We’re going to do that anyway,” said Netanyahu. “There was never a question that we’re not going to leave Hamas there.”Calling for an immediate ceasefire, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned of the “massive death and destruction that a military operation against Gaza would inevitably cause”.Christian Cardon, the chief spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said: “The intensification of hostilities in Gaza means more killing, more displacement, more destruction and more panic.“Gaza is a closed space from which nobody can escape … and where access to healthcare, food and safe water is dwindling. Meanwhile, the security of humanitarians is getting worse by the hour. This is intolerable.”Aid organisations say Israel has made negligible efforts to significantly increase humanitarian assistance to the levels needed by the population in Gaza, prompting a warning from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, earlier this week of the danger of a “true disaster”.View image in fullscreenPalestinians have already begun to head south amid Israel’s warnings of further military action in Gaza City.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersOpposition to a new military operation – repeatedly “approved” by Israeli figures in recent days – is growing inside Israel and internationally.More protests are expected to follow a large one held on Sunday, and the families of Israeli hostages held a press conference on Thursday to call for Israel to agree to a ceasefire deal – already accepted by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – which would result in half of the 20 surviving hostages being released.“We’re a step away from a total torpedoing” of a deal, said Lishay Miran Lavi, whose husband, Omri, is thought to still be alive in captivity. “There is an agreement on the table that could save the lives of hostages and return the dead for proper burial.“Hamas has agreed, but the prime minister’s office is working to sabotage it … You cannot conduct a 22-month war whose sole purpose is to preserve political power.”Representatives from hostages’ families referred sceptically to Netanyahu’s repeated promises that Israel was close to victory.Israel’s increasing defiance of international opinion has pushed it closer to the status of a pariah state, both for the destruction andmass starvation it has visited on Gaza, and for its approval on Wednesday of the illegal settlement aimed at destroying any possibility of a future Palestinian state. The approval was described by the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, as a “flagrant breach” of international law.Netanyahu appears to have bent to the demands of far-right minority parties in his fragile coalition who have called for the conquest of Gaza and threatened to collapse the government in the event of a ceasefire deal.The Israeli military bombarded Gaza City overnight, a day after the call-up of60,000 reservistswas announced. A military official said most reservists would not serve in combat, giving strength to the argument that at least some of Israel’s recent statements amount to posturing against the background of complex ceasefire talks.In one attack, Israel struck an area of Deir al-Balah as a nearby street was crowded with civilians.0:22Palestinians flee after Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah, Gaza – videoCalling up the reservists is likely to take weeks, giving mediators time to try to bridge gaps over the ceasefire proposal, to which the Israeli government has yet to officially respond.The proposal, which aligns with anoutline drawn up by Donald Trump’s special envoySteve Witkoff, calls for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 10 living hostages being held by Hamas militants and of 18 bodies. In turn, Israel would release about 200 long-serving Palestinian prisoners.Israel had signalled weeks ago that it accepted that outline for a deal, with the distance between Hamas and Israel’s negotiators only closing since.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuDavid LammyHamasPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

How many times, one is tempted to ask, does one plan need approving?As so often in dealing with Israeli officials, and Netanyahu in particular, filtering out what is true and what is not, and what is calculated misdirection, is a complicated business.While Reuters reported a junior defence spokesperson as suggesting that the operation to takeGazaCity had begun, quotes from that briefing paint a more complex picture, including a reference to the second phase of Operation Gideon’s Chariots, the Israeli military offensive that began in May.Recent military activity in Gaza was depicted as being “preliminary” to any new offensive. For his part, Netanyahu’s office put out an opaque statement saying he had asked for planning timelines for an expanded Gaza City operation to be accelerated.Given the profounddivisions within Israeli society, with about 400,000 people demonstrating recently in favour of a ceasefire deal and release of the remaining 20 living hostages in Gaza, and continued contact between mediators and Israel and Hamas, unpacking the politics of what Netanyahu is up to is tricky.On the one hand, far-right members of his coalition have threatened once again to walk away in the event of a ceasefire, demanding the conquest of all of Gaza and then Jewish settlement of the coastal strip. On the other is the fact that ceasefire talks are continuing.This weekHamas said it had accepteda ceasefire proposal that would allow for the release of about 10 living hostages in the first phase of a 60-day pause, while senior Israeli officials – but not an official “delegation” – have met mediators even as Netanyahu has dragged his feet over giving Israel’s reply, reportedly delaying a cabinet meeting at which it would have been discussed.All of which leaves big questions unanswered. While some Israeli and international analysts have speculated that the current moves on the ground amount to pressure on Hamas to improve any deal that might just be emerging, others – including Ronen Bergman, one of Israel’s most authoritative security analysts – suggest that Netanyahu would like to push on with fighting for years in order todelay his ongoing legal casesand ensure his continued political survival.What most agree is that any major new campaign is likely to have serious consequences. For Israelis, including senior figures in the defence establishment, one concern is whether living hostages would survive, an issue motivating mass demonstrations.Others point out that, to all intents and purposes, the deal to which Hamas has agreed is one Israel signalled its agreement to only weeks ago. Any offensive would be seen by the international community for what it is: the most cynical of moves that would lead to an even deeper humanitarian catastrophe – if that can even be imagined.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelanalysisShareReuse this content"

The actions marked a further intensification of recent international criticism for Israel over its tactics in Gaza and theWest Bank.The statement, which was signed by 21 countries including the UK, Australia, Canada and France, said: “The decision by the Israeli higher planning committee to approve plans for settlement construction in the E1 area, east of Jerusalem, is unacceptable and a violation of international law. We condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms.”In a separate statement, the Foreign Office confirmedit had summonedHotovely in a display of public criticism. “If implemented, these settlement plans would be a flagrant breach of international law and would divide a future Palestinian state in two, critically undermining a two-state solution,” the department said in a statement.It did not say which minister or official had met Hotovely or what was said in the meeting. The Israeli embassy did not respond to a request for comment.Israel announced on Wednesdayit had approvedplans to build the major new block in the West Bank, with the deliberate intention – according to Israel’s far-right finance minster, Bezalel Smotrich – of preventing the creation of a Palestinian state.Smotrich on Wednesdaycalled the decisionto approve the settlement a “significant step that practically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish people’s hold on the heart of the land of Israel”.The proposalswould extendthe Jewish settlement of Ma’ale Adumim towards Jerusalem, further separating occupied East Jerusalem from the West Bank, and dividing the north and south of the territory.The statement by the 21 foreign ministers said: “Minister Smotrich says this plan will make a two-state solution impossible by dividing any Palestinian state and restricting Palestinian access to Jerusalem. This brings no benefits to the Israeli people. Instead, it risks undermining security and fuels further violence and instability, taking us further away from peace.”British officials say Israel’s renewed expansionism in the West Bank has played a critical role in pushing them into a decision to recognise Palestine as an independent state. Keir Starmersaid last monthhe would issue formal recognition before next month’s UN general assembly, unless Israel committed to a ceasefire and a two-state solution.UN and Red Cross warn of catastrophe if Israel launches Gaza City offensiveRead moreThe international community has also expressed outrage overIsrael’s plan to take control of Gaza City, with the UN assistant secretary general, Miroslav Jenča, warning it would cause “forced displacement, killings and destruction”.The Israel Defense Forces said on Wednesday that Benjamin Netanyahu had instructed them to accelerate the planned assault on Gaza City, the prospect of which has already prompted thousands of Palestinians to flee.On Thursday the UK was one of 27 countries tosign a separate statementdemanding that international journalists be given access to Gaza to allow them to cover the “unfolding humanitarian catastrophe” in the war zone.The statement from the Media Freedom Coalition (MFC), an international advocacy group that the UK helped to create, said: “We … urge Israel to allow immediate independent foreign media access and afford protection for journalists operating in Gaza.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesForeign policyDavid LammyForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Or perhaps Netanyahu, like a modern day Macbeth, can no longer see a way forward or a way back, “in blood stepped in so far that should I wade no more returning were as tedious as go o’er.”ShareUpdated at06.46 EDT"

Others are labelled as snacks for babies, which goes against government recommendations that children aged six to 12 months do not need snacks between meals, only milk.It comes after researchers found that leading brands, such as Ella’s Kitchen and Heinz, weremaking sugar-heavy, nutritionally poor baby foodthat failed to meet the needs of infants.A report by the University of Leeds school of food science and nutrition,published in April, found that some brands also carried misleading marketing claims, and urged the government to impose the same traffic light system found on chocolate bars and ice-cream.The report’s authors said the new voluntary guidelines were disappointing and would have limited impact. Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the Leeds study, said: “They’re quite narrow in scope, only looking at sugar and salt. But salt is not a major concern in UK baby food.”She raised particular concern that the voluntary guidelines did not address the poor nutritional value of many purees and pouches, which were targeted at weaning babies. The NHSadvises parents to start weaning when a child is about six months old, with vegetables that are not sweet, such as broccoli, cauliflower and spinach.“These products are often too watery. Children need really energy-dense food, rich nutrient-dense food with lots of different fibres and different sources of iron and zinc,” she said. “But these purees, particularly those targeted as first weaning foods, are really low in energy. They are bad substitutions, especially if you’re displacing a nutritious milk feed.”High levels of sugar in children’s diets is a significant factor contributing to high rates of childhood obesity in the UK, which is among the highest in western Europe. At the start of primary school,more than 22% of children in England are obese or overweight, according to the latest official statistics.The public health minister, Ashley Dalton, said the guidelines would help parents who were often“bombarded with confusing labels, disguising unhealthy foods packed with hidden sugars and salt”.Prof Simon Kenny,NHSEngland’s national clinical director for children and young people, said: “These new guidelines alongside clearer labelling will help empower busy parents to make nutritious choices that give their children the best possible start in life.”Last year a House of Lords report found commercial infant foods “are routinely high in sugar and marketed misleadingly”. It called on the government to introducemandatory legal standards for commercial infant foods, without input from manufacturers.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said it expected manufacturers to meet the labelling guidelines within 18 months, adding: “If businesses fail to act, we will consider tougher measures.”Another study found legislation in England to restrict supermarket sales of foods high in fat, sugar or salt had led to millions fewer products being bought.Researchers at the University of Leeds estimated that 2m fewer such products were sold per day after the law took effect in 2022. The number of items high in fat, sugar or salt sold in Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Asda dropped from 20 out of every 100 before the legislation to 19 out of every 100 afterwards.Explore more on these topicsChildren's healthNutritionHealth policyFood & drink industryNHSEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

We are beyond excited to embark on this beautiful next chapter of parenthood in both peace and privacy.”The post, which was accompanied by the Beatles song Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, continued: “And then there were 3.”Brown, best known for her role as Eleven in the Netflix dramaStranger Things, and Bongiovi, a model who is the son of the musician Jon Bon Jovi, married last October after their engagement in 2023.Alongside photos from their wedding last year, Bongiovi wrote in a post at the time: “Forever and always, your husband.”Brown has previously spoken about wanting to become a parent, adding that she wanted a large family with her husband. She mentioned the possibility of adopting.Speaking in March on the SmartLess podcast, hosted by Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett, the actor said: “Jake knows how important it is to me [to have a child].”Brown, who recently appeared alongside Chris Pratt in sci-fi film The Electric State, added: “Of course, I want to focus on really establishing myself as an actor and as a producer, but I also find it’s so important to start a family, for me, personally.”In 2023, the publication of Brown’s debut novel reignited a debate over ghostwritten celebrity books.Nineteen Steps, inspired by her grandmother’s experience of the 1943 Bethnal Green tube disaster, was ghostwritten by author Kathleen McGurlyet the cover of the book featured only Brown’s name.In response to a subsequently deleted tweet by Waterstones promoting the book, many X users had criticised the star.Brown had posted an image on Instagram of herself holding the book standing next to McGurl, with the caption: “I couldn’t have done this without you!”Zoella (the media personality Zoë Sugg), Katie Price and Naomi Campbell are among celebrities who have also used ghostwriters for their fiction books.Explore more on these topicsMillie Bobby BrownStranger ThingsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

The variations are fractional compared with what came before.GCSE results: pupils in England bounce back from pandemic as top grades riseRead moreAs the tide of disruption recedes, however, it exposes the broken legacy of a policy introduced by Michael Gove more than a decade ago, of forcing students who fail to achieve at least a grade 4 in GCSE maths and English to resit the qualifications while they remain in education.Until 2019 the policy, along with reforms to GCSE formats and grading, led to fewer resits being required, especially among disadvantaged pupils. That has now reversed, and the number forced into retakes has gone up. There were 346,000 entries in English and mathsGCSEsby students aged 17 to 19 this year, compared with fewer than 300,000 in 2024.Just one in six for the older age group passed maths this year, and only one in 100 got top grades. Among the 19-year-olds disappointed this year will be some who sat GCSE maths for the third time after failing to achieve a grade 4 “standard pass” in 2023 or 2024, leading educators and experts to become increasingly critical of the resit policy.Jill Duffy, the chair of the Joint Council for Qualifications and chief executive of the OCR examination board, said nearly a quarter of GCSE maths and English entries were now resits, an all-time high.“This is a resit crisis. Tinkering at the edges of policy won’t fix this,” she said.Prof Ulrike Tillmann, the chair of the Royal Society’s education committee, said: “History shows that two-thirds of GCSE resit students do not achieve the required grade by age 19, and we cannot let this pattern continue.Primary Sats ‘working well’ but Gove’s Ebacc needs scrutiny, review chief saysRead more“Repeated resits create huge pressures on teachers, schools and colleges, not to mention the emotional strain on students forced to retake an exam that does not serve them. We must question whether the maths content these students are studying meets their needs.”Duffy agreed that a closer look at maths and English was needed across the secondary curriculum. “When we’ve looked at scripts for those students who aren’t getting grade 4, what’s really clear is that there are fundamental skills they should have been getting much earlier in key stage 3, if not earlier,” she said.She envisions changes to the two subjects, to reduce “overcrowding” in maths by stripping out topics such as trigonometry and to make the English qualification more relevant.“When we look at GCSE English, I would say it is universally unpopular. I haven’t met a student or teacher who likes it,” she said. “We really need to look at that and we need to add more modern relevant texts so we’re making it more relevant and more engaging for young people today.”Change may be on the way. The government has commissioned anational curriculum reviewfor England, which is expected to report later this year. One of the key points among itsinterim findingswill be “considering the impact of current performance measures on young people’s choices and outcomes” – a hint that the built-in cycle of failure may be ending.Explore more on these topicsGCSEsMathematicsExamsSecondary schoolsEducation policyCollegesSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

With Newsom’s signature, the measure now heads to voters in a special election this November.Newsom, who led the redistricting push, said California was “neutralizing” Texas’s maps designed to helpRepublicansstave off losses in next year’s congressional midterm elections.“They fired the first shot in Texas,” the governor said, surrounded by Democratic lawmakers at a signing ceremony on Thursday afternoon. “When all things are equal, [when] we’re all playing by the same set of rules, there’s no question that the Republican party will be the minority party in theHouse of Representativesnext year.”The nation’s two most populous – and ideologically opposed – states were racing on parallel tracks toward consequential redistricting votes, potentially within hours of each other. AsDemocratsin Sacramento signed off on a legislative package that would put their “election rigging response act” before voters in a special election this fall, Republicans in Austin were nearing a final vote on their own partisan map.“We will not let our political system be hijacked by authoritarianism. And today, we give every Californian the power to say no,” saidassembly speaker Robert Rivas, a California Democrat, in remarks before the vote. “To say no to Donald Trump’s power grab and yes to our people, to our state and to our democracy.”In California, Democratic state lawmakers faced a Friday deadline to give the secretary of state’s office enough time to place the amendment on the November ballot. Both chambers took up the package simultaneously on Thursday, volleying it back and forth until final approval was secured on all three measures: the proposed congressional map, an accompanying constitutional amendment and funding to run the administration of the special election.Democrats broke into applause on the chamber floor after the assembly passed the constitutional amendment.Approval by theTexassenate, which is expected as early as Thursday, would mark the end of a dramatic showdown with the state’s outnumbered Democratic lawmakers whose two-week boycott captured national attention and set in motion a coast-to-coast redistricting clash.Texas redistricting: how new Republican maps will hurt DemocratsRead moreThe California plan is designed to flip as many as five Republican-held seats in California – the exact number of additional GOP seats Trump has said he is “entitled to” in Texas.“He’s trying to rig the election,” Newsom said of the president. “Open your eyes to what is going on in the United States of America in 2025.”The redistricting tit-for-tat is an extraordinary deviation from the norm that will determine the battle lines for next year’s midterm elections. Traditionally, states redraw congressional maps once a decade based on census data, with both the Texas and California maps originally intended to last through 2030.Before Thursday’s vote, California Republicans pleaded with their Democratic colleagues to oppose what they derisively called a “Gavinmander”. Some members disagreed with Trump’s push for partisan maps in Texas and elsewhere, but said Newsom’s “fight fire with fire” was harmful.“The problem when you fight fire with fire is you burn it all down,” James Gallagher, the state assembly Republican leader, said at a news conference.Initially, Democratic lawmakers said the changes would only take effect in response to a gerrymander by a Republican state – a condition that would be met when the Texas legislatures sends the maps to the state’s governor, Greg Abbott, for his promised signature. But they amended the language on Thursday to remove any reference to a trigger, arguing it was no longer necessary now Texas has moved ahead.A Texas senate committee approved the GOP plan on Thursday morning, setting up a vote on final passage in the chamber, which was scheduled to reconvene that evening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They returned only after California moved forward with its counterproposal. When they returned, some were assigned police minders and forced to sign permission slips before leaving the capitol. Several spent the night in the chamber in protest before Wednesday’s session, where Republicans pushed through a map designed explicitly to boost their party’s chances in 2026.California Democrats are moving ahead after days of contentious debate over the cost – and consequences – of a referendum to temporarily toss out the maps drawn by the state’s voter-approved independent redistricting commission. Republicans estimated that a special election could cost more than $230m – money they said would be better spent on other issues like healthcare.On Wednesday night, the state supreme court declined an emergency request by Republican lawmakers seeking to block the Democratic plan from moving forward. Republicans have vowed to keep fighting it in court, and called for a federal inquiry into the proposal.The redistricting push has also caused angst among some Democrats and independents who have fought for years to combat gerrymandering.Testifying in favor of the changes during a hearing earlier this week, Sara Sadhwani, a political science professor who served as a Democratic member of the state’s independent redistricting commission in 2020, said the map-drawing tit-for-tat presented California voters with a “moral conflict”. But she argued that Democrats had to push back on the president’s power play.“It brings me no joy to see the maps that we passed fairly by the commission to be tossed aside,” she said. “I do believe this is a necessary step in a much bigger battle to shore up free and fair elections in our nation.”The California revision also drew the backing of former presidentBarack Obamaand other champions of fair redistricting, such as his former attorney general, Eric Holder.But Newsom’s redistricting plan – a high-stakes gambit for the term-limited governor who has made no secret of his 2028 presidential ambitions – is not assured to succeed. It faces mounting opposition from high-profile Republicans, including the state’s former governorArnold Schwarzenegger, who has vowed to “terminate gerrymandering”.Early polling has been mixed. But a new survey conducted by Newsom’s longtime pollster David Binder found strong support for the measure in the heavily Democratic state, with 57% of voters backing it while 35% opposed it.“All of us support independent redistricting, here in California and in every state in this union,” said Mike McGuire, the senate president pro tempore, at the signing ceremony. “One thing that we do not support is unilateral disarmament, when the fairness of the 2026 election is being threatened.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaTexasDemocratsRepublicansHouse of RepresentativesUS CongressUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m very good at grass, because I have a lot of golf courses all over the place. I know more about grass than any human being I think anywhere in the world,” Trump told the officers.“And we are going to be re-grassing all of your parks, all brand-new sprinkler systems, the best that you can buy. Just like Augusta. It’ll look like Augusta. It will look like, more importantly, Trump national golf club, that’s even better,” he said, comparing his own golf course in Virginia to the venue for the Masters.“We’re going to have all brand-new, beautiful grass. You know, like everything else, grass has a life. Do you know that? Grass has a life. You know, we have a life, and grass has a life. And the grass here died about 40 years ago,” Trump added.The freewheeling remarks from Trump also touched several other topics unrelated to DC crime, and basked in his legal victory of a New York state appeals court throwing out a $500m judgement against him in the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general Letitia James in 2022.The excursion came a day after JD Vance, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, visited national guard troops posted at Union Station and pledged to expand the crackdown.The group’s impromptu stop at a Shake Shack in Union Station drew boos, insults and epithets that echoed around the cavernous entrance hall of the Beaux Arts-style train station.View image in fullscreenJeanine Pirro, the US attorney for DC, and homeland security secretary Kristi Noem in Washington on Thursday.Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesTrump has long complained about perceived crime rates in DC and the declaration gave him an opening to invoke a legal justification to bring the Metropolitan police department under the administration’s control, and deploy national guard troops from several states.Falsely painting DC as an urban hellscape overrun by “bloodthirsty criminals”, Trump authorized the deployment of law enforcement units across the city – both in areas with high rates of recorded crime, as well as popular nightlife and tourist spots, including near the White House and Union Station.Since then, the White House has also tied its immigration enforcement agenda to reducing crime in DC, deploying US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents and other federal law enforcement on local police patrols to detain immigrants in moped traffic stops.The surge of law enforcement agents has corresponded to a higher number of daily arrests, which the administration has used to argue Trump’s move was reducing the number of undocumented immigrants and take credit for bringing down crimes such as carjackings and shootings.Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, DC’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, said the city had previously had drops in violent crime before Trump took it over, adding an order from the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, compelling DC police to cooperate with federal officials focused on immigration and homeless enforcement.Explore more on these topicsWashington DCDonald TrumpUS policingUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

US tariffs on EU cars will be lowered “from the first day of the same month in which the European Union’s legislative proposal is introduced”, it says, adding that the legislation must “be consistent with this Framework Agreement and enacted by the necessary legislatures”.European leaders have some reservations. Last month the French prime minister, François Bayrou, described “a dark day when an alliance of free peoples, united to affirm their values and defend their interests, resolves to submission”.And the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said at anews conferenceearlier this week: “I support this trade agreement, but I do so without any enthusiasm,” noting the deal would have a limited impact on Spain’s economy given its smaller exposure to the US market.On Thursday, industry leadersresponded with dismay.In 2024, the EU exported €8bn worth of alcohol, including €5bn of wine, to the US, its main export market. The French wine exporters federation said on Thursday it was “hugely disappointed” by the EU’s admission that it failed to secure a tariff exemption for the sector in the US-EU trade deal.“We are certain that this will create major difficulties for the wines and spirits sector,” the head of the wine and spirits federation FEVS, Gabriel Picard, said.France’s minister for trade, Laurent Saint-Martin, said the government would seek “additional exemptions” for wines and spirits as part of the US-EU trade deal. “The agreement leaves open the possibility for additional exemptions and we’ll be working on them. The story isn’t over,” he wrote on X, adding: “I’m not saying it will be easy or that it’ll happen next week … defending our exports remains our priority.”Christophe Chateau of the Bordeaux winemakers association, said the US was his members’ biggest market and the tariff would be a “further brake” on sales. However, he said he was relieved Trump had not carried out threats to tax imports of European wine at 200%. “It could have been worse, but it’s not good news,” he added.Before the announcement on Thursday, the Swiss chocolate makers Lindt and Swiss knife producers Victorinox announced they planned to move part of their production to the US to avoid tariffs on exports.The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States also criticized the deal, noting 15% tariffs on EU spirit imports to the US could result in an estimated retail loss of more than $1bn and 12,000 jobs. “We are disappointed that this joint statement did not include permanent tariff-free trade for distilled spirits on both sides of the Atlantic,” its president and CEO, Chris Swonger, said in a statement.Of the 27 EU member states, Germany exports most to the U.S. (€161bn last year) followed by Ireland (€71.3bn), Italy (€64.8bn), France (€47.1bn) and the Netherlands (€43.3bn) according to figures from the EU’s statistics agency Eurostat.Last month, the Italian Employers’ Study Centre, warned a 15% rate combined with a 13.5% devaluation of the dollar against the euro in 2025 would cause a €22.6bnbillion decline in the country’s exports to the US.“We are talking about 15%, but in reality the surcharge will be close to 30%,” Dario Costantini, president of the CNA (the national confederation of small and medium size businesses), said. “This is an unfair and disproportionate tax that penalises products made in Italy and will also have negative repercussions on the US economy.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEuropeTrump administrationDonald TrumpTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their workers’ salaries did not keep up.As executive remuneration ballooned, the average CEO-to-worker pay gap across the 100 companies in the S&P 500 with lowest median worker pay – dubbed the Low-Wage 100 by the Institute for Policy Studies – widened by 12.9% between 2019 and 2024, from 560 to 1 to 632 to 1.“Median pay increased only modestly, whereas CEO pay really skyrocketed,” said Sarah Anderson, director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies,and author of the report.Between 2019 to 2024, CEO pay at these companies increased by 34.7%, unadjusted for inflation, compared with a 16.3% increase in these firms’ average median worker pay during the same period – short of inflation, which came to 22.6% over the same period.By last year, average CEO compensation in the Low-Wage 100 stood at $17.2m. Average median worker pay was $35,570.Of the 100 firms, median worker pay fell at 22 between 2019 and 2024. Ulta Beauty reported a 46% drop in median worker pay to $11,078 as the company significantly expanded its part-time workforce.A bar chart showing the biggest CEO-to-worker pay ratios in the S&P 500Starbucks’ CEO pay was thelargest gap in 2024, with its CEO, Brian Niccol, receiving total compensation worth $95.8m, 6,666 times as much as the company’s $14,674 median pay.“It’s a stunning message forStarbucksmanagement to send to their workers who’ve organized unions at 570 stores in recent years, and they’re still waiting for the company to negotiate a contract. It says a lot about who they really value at that company and who they don’t,” said Anderson.Starbucks did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the report.The IPS report cites aJune roundtablehosted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US markets regulator, on executive compensation disclosure requirements, where Drew Hambly, investment director at CalPers, the largest public pension fund in the US,describedthe negative impacts overcompensation of executives has on low-wage workforces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And if you’re going to drive value over time, that’s the face of your company.”In recent years US families havestruggledwith high costs for groceries and housing, and layoffshave been on the rise. “In the midst of all of this, CEOs are focused on making themselves even richer, instead of thinking about the welfare of their employees or even the long-term growth of their company,” said Anderson. “I think if they continue on this path, it’s going to be a trend that is bad, not just for workers, but for these companies and our economy as a whole.”Between 2019 to 2024, Low-Wage 100 firms spent $644bn on stock buybacks. More than half spent more on buybacks than on capital improvements at their firms.Lowe’s spent $46.6bn on stock buybacks: $28,456 per each of the retailer’s 273,000 employees, according to the report. Home Depot ranked second in stock buybacks during this period, spending $37.9bn.The report also noted 32 billionaires owe their wealth to Low-Wage 100 corporations, including eight billionaires from Walmart, four from Estee Lauder and three from DoorDash.As policy solutions, the report highlighted support for a tax hike on corporations that pay their CEO at least 50 times more what they pay employees. It also urged policymakers to increase taxes on stock buybacks.Ulta Beauty, Lowe’s and Home Depot did not respond to requests for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The allegations are unconfirmed.The US president has waged an extraordinary war on theFed’s independence, breaking with precedent to demand interest rate cuts and urge its chair, Jerome Powell, to resign. Trump promptly called on Cook to quit on Wednesday.Fed governor urged by Trump to resign will not be ‘bullied’ into stepping downRead moreThe Department of Justice is reported to have indicated it is investigating the allegations, with a top Trump official telling Powell the case “requires further examination” – and calling on him to remove Cook from the Fed’s board.“At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms Cook from your Board,” Ed Martin, the official, wrote in a letter, according toBloomberg News. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.”The Fed declined to comment. The justice department declined to comment.Despite Martin’s demand, the Fed chair has no authority under the Federal Reserve Act to remove another member of the board of governors. On Wednesday,the Wall Street Journalreported that Trump had discussed how to fire Cook for cause, citing an unnamed administration official.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the report.On Wednesday morning, Bill Pulte, head of the US Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has become – beyond the president himself – one of the Trump administration’s most vocal critics of Powell and the Fed, published allegations against Cook.Pulte says the finance agency is investigating a third property owned by Cook.In June 2021, Cook entered into a 15-year mortgage agreement on a property in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and declared her intention to use it as her principal residence, according to Pulte. In July 2021, Cook bought a property in Atlanta, Georgia, and also committed to use that property as her primary residence when taking out a 30-year mortgage, according to Pulte.In a statement, Cook said: “I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of theFederal Reserveand so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”She is the latest figure to be targeted by Trump officials over claims of mortgage fraud. Pulte has madesimilar allegationsabout the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and the California senator Adam Schiff, both Democrats. The justice department is reportedly investigating.James has dismissed the claims as “baseless”, while Schiff has vehemently denied the allegations, and accused the administration of weaponizing the US justice system.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveTrump administrationUS economyUS politicsEconomicsJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

Passengers who pay for the window seats can instead find themselves sitting next to a windowless wall, despite Delta and United allegedly charging tens or sometimes hundreds of dollars for the seats.“Had plaintiffs and the class members known that the seats they were purchasing [were] windowless, they would not have selected them – much less have paid extra,” the United complaint said. The Delta complaint contained similar language.Carter Greenbaum, an attorney whose law firm, Greenbaum Olbrantz LLP, filed the suits, told the New York Times: “We’re seeking to hold United and Delta accountable for charging customers premiums for products that they didn’t deliver, and misrepresenting the nature of the products that they did deliver.”Neither Delta nor United responded to requests for comment from Reuters.In an annual report this year, Uniteddescribed itselfas “the largest airline measured by available seat miles in the world”.

Or, at least, when it became public knowledge. And it was the prompt for two things to happen.Firstly, it would be reported a few days later thatArsenalwere also on the case. The club’s new sporting director, Andrea Berta, had put the feelers out for the Crystal Palace forward. Call it a declaration of interest, albeit Berta was having a lot of conversations about a lot of potential targets at the time. His idea was to have plenty of options on the boil before deciding which to prioritise.‘Lads, it’s Tottenham’: missing out on Eze just the latest banana skin | Rob DaviesRead moreThen, there was a subtle change to the mood music at Spurs, a kind of step back into a holding pattern. Agent talk, was the word inside the club. Eze was more likely to stay at Palace. It would be wrong to get too far ahead of anything on this one. But it was impossible to ignore the alternative reading: Spurs did not want to be drawn into a battle with their rivals over one of the most exciting talents on the market.Spurs were fearful of that, and for good reason. They had to know that, given the choice, Eze would go for Arsenal over them. There were the emotional reasons. He had supported Arsenal as a kid and played in their academy until his release as a 13-year-old; the line about how he cried for a week afterwards is a well-known part of his story. Yet it would not only be about dreams and unfinished business. Eze would surely look at the Premier League table from last season. At which club would he stand the better chance of winning the title?At this point it is worth introducing Mikel Arteta, who let it be known just how highly he rated Eze and how perfectly he would fit into his team. Eze’s head was turned. So Spurs entered territory in which the reward was tantalising, almost irresistible, but the risk was extreme. It was as if they were shadow boxing with Arsenal, their every move over Eze likely to come right back at them. Arsenal were a devil on their shoulder; watching, waiting.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze spent five years with Crystal Palace.Photograph: John Walton/PASpurs would pivot to Morgan Gibbs-White in July only to run into the immovable object that is Evangelos Marinakis. No deal, the Nottingham Forest owner said. There would be a new one for Gibbs-White at Forest and, sadly for Spurs,egg on their faceafter they believed they would be able to exploit a £60m release clause in his old contract.The Gibbs-White episode has been a climate-shaper in Spurs’s summer and then there was the moment whenJames Maddison ruptured his anterior cruciate ligamentin the pre-season game against Newcastle on 3 August; a shattering blow for him and Spurs.Dejan Kulusevski, the club’s other key central attacking midfielder, had knee surgery in May and is out until around the turn of the year, so the need to act in the market was obvious and urgent. Why not move straight away for Eze; give him and Palace a decision to make by meeting the £68m release clause in his deal, which was in place until 15 August?Spurs’s hesitation was to do with the fact they considered the number to be too high for a 27-year-old with 12 England caps and no experience of European football at club level. It is not the only detail in terms of optics that has hurt them as Arsenal prepare to pay pretty much that amount to take Eze to the Emirates, with Spurs themselves having ended up ready to do likewise.There has been the idea that Spurs had a clear run at Eze because Arsenal, after spending around £200m on six other signings, would need to raise money via sales before they could make a bid. Well, they have sold nobody and still pushed the button. Unless Arsenal have a sale or two lined up, could it be that they have more financial headroom than they have let on?View image in fullscreenTottenham also missed out on Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White.Photograph: Shaun Brooks/CameraSport/Getty ImagesIt is easy to pick over the curiosities. Eze is represented by CAA Base, the influential firm of agents who have close links to Spurs. Should that have given Spurs an edge? It must be said that Base will always put the wishes of their players first. And why did it seemingly take Kai Havertz feeling a knee injury afterSunday’s win at Manchester Unitedfor Arsenal to move on Eze? There are similarities in the profile of both players but there is a fundamental difference: Havertz can play as a No 9, Eze cannot. With Gabriel Jesus a long-term injury casualty, the loss of Havertz ought to have led Arsenal to look for a No 9 to provide support for the new signing, Viktor Gyökeres. Not take Eze.The great teams Crystal Palace can follow in their first season in EuropeRead moreThe reality is that Spurs were never going to win this fight. We will never know what would have happened if they had offered to pay Eze’s release clause. But it feels fair to assume that it would have led Arsenal into following suit. Spurs eventually reached an agreement with Palace on Wednesday and they believed they had one with Eze, too.If Arsenal were not an option, Eze would have joined Spurs. At this stage of his career, after giving everything for Palace across five seasons, he is ready for a change; the chance to play in the Champions League. But Arsenal were an option; they never went away. It took them a matter of hours to slide in for the steal. The bad news for Spurs is that the very thing they feared has come to pass. The memes are out, an Eze mural has appeared in the tunnel outside the Emirates and the time is tighter to provide Frank with a new No 10.Have Spurs built on the momentum of their Europa League triumph from last season? They have added João Paulinha and Mohammed Kudus for the starting XI, while it was a tonic to tie the new captain, Cristian Romero, to a long-term contract. But when their supporters look around, they see that Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal have spent £200m or significantly upwards on signings. Manchester City, meanwhile, have invested £150m. The mood at Tottenham is back to being edgy. Arsenal have made a statement of intent.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurArsenalanalysisShareReuse this content"

The victim was taken to a local hospital and remained in critical condition.In a statement, aLas Vegasmetropolitan police department spokesperson said the suspect, 57-year-old Quenton Marcelles Brown, was stopped a short distance from the scene and taken into custody. He was booked into the Clark County Detention Center on a charge of attempted murder.TMZ first reported that the altercation began when Brown allegedly dinged the victim’s car door with his Lincoln Navigator. A heated argument followed, during which Brown allegedly stabbed the man in the back and stomach.Court records reviewed Wednesday listed Brown as an inmate at the Clark County facility. A person with knowledge of the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it, confirmed that the man arrested is Jaylen Brown’s father.Before becoming known as the parent ofone of the NBA’s brightest stars, Marselles Brown carved out a lengthy career as a professional boxer.

The purchase fills an obvious need for the Rapids, as the club’s previous starting No 10, Djordje Mihailović, was traded toToronto FCfor $8m after expressing to the club that he wanted to leave not even two full seasons after joining.Washington Spirit seize the moment as DC United stumble in city of unrestRead moreMihailović said he requested a transfer for “personal reasons”, a surprising turn of events for a player who quickly became a linchpin of the team’s attacking unit after joining from AZ Alkmaar, leading Colorado to the playoffs for the first time in two seasons last year. This year, the Rapids are enjoying their best season since 2021.Toronto FC, meanwhile, are in the midst of a full rebuild, having failed to make theMLSplayoffs in each of the previous four seasons and never finishing higher than 11th in the Eastern Conference in that timespan. The club recently jettisoned high-priced stars Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi and remain mired near the bottom of the East.But in his introductory press conference with Toronto FC, Mihailovic indicated that he felt his new club had a greater commitment to success, citing “The idea of getting back to winning trophies here” among his reasons for the move.“Everybody talks about winning. Everybody talks about making playoffs,” he said. “I could truly sense the truth behind them explaining their project.”Now, the Rapids are allowing their fans move on without Mihailović. In announcing the acquisition of Aaronson, the club said it will allow fans who bought jerseys with Mihailović’s name and No 10 on the back for new ones, either blank, with Aaronson’s name and number, or that of select other players.Maga hats, anti-Ice banners and plenty of confusion: did MLS create its own political mess?Read moreA Rapids spokesperson told the Guardian US that the club decided to enact the program as a way of showing their commitment to their community, admitting that Mihailovic’s move “came as a surprise” and that Aaronson’s acquisition marks “a turning point and a fresh chapter for the club, our fans, and our new rising star”.A program of this type is exceedingly rare but not unheard of. In 2018, sports retailer Fanaticssaidit would allow NBA fans to exchange recently purchased jerseys of a player who was traded for another. The retailer nowruns a similar programacross all sports for players whose jersey is purchased within 90 days of being traded. The NFL put the brakes on asimilar program run by a Detroit realtorfor Matthew Stafford Lions last year. In a much more serious scenario, the New England Patriots ran a program to allow fans totrade in their Aaron Hernandez jerseysafter he was charged with the murder of Odin Lloyd.Paxten Aaronson, the brother of Leeds United’s Brenden Aaronson, is leaving behind the chance to play in the German Bundesliga but will step into a situation where he’ll be relied upon to take a leading role for the Rapids. The younger Aaronson spent last season on loan to Utrecht in the Dutch Eredivisie, where he scored a team-high eight goals and added four assists while starting consistently as Utrecht finished fourth in the league.Aaronson moved to Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022 after breaking through with the Philadelphia Union, his home town club. He made his debut for the US men’s national team in 2023 and was on the roster for the 2025 Gold Cup along with his brother.Explore more on these topicsMLSColorado RapidsToronto FCUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The object hit a 12-year-old girl, and Burgess was charged with two counts of assault. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Burgess had an attorney.The WNBA’s sex toy epidemic is Skibidi brainrot writ large. Trolling has replaced meaning with noise | Lee EscobedoRead moreSimilar disturbances happened during games in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Chicago in late July and early August.Some of the sex toys reached the court and caused game delays, while others landed in the crowds, such as in Phoenix where an 18-year-old was arrested. The man in that case told police it was a prank that had been trending on social media and he bought the toy a day earlier to take to the game. He was tackled at the arena by a volunteer who had allegedly witnessed him throwing it and began following him as he tried to leave the arena. Police have said that man was arrested on suspicion of assault, disorderly conduct and publicly displaying explicit sexual material.A man was also arrested in Georgia for the two incidents at Atlanta Dream games, according to a police report. He is charged with disorderly conduct, criminal trespassing, public indecency and indecent exposure. All four charges are misdemeanors in the state of Georgia, meaning that if he is convicted, the punishment for each can be a fine of up to $1,000 or jail time of up to 12 months. A misdemeanor for public indecency and indecent exposure may also require registration on the state’s sex offender list.The report said the Georgia man told police “this was supposed to be a joke and the joke [was] supposed to go viral.”The sex toy that landed on the court in Los Angeles nearly hit Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham.League officials have said any person throwing objects onto the court will be ejected from the arena and face a minimum one-year ban from attending games.Media reports on the disturbances have tied the toy-throwings to a group involved in a related cryptocurrency meme coin.Explore more on these topicsWNBANew York LibertyBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It eventually lodged 15ft from where Reid was sitting, in a wall between his bathroom and his office door. The Chiefs installed bulletproof glass soon afterward.Efton Chism III to trouble for Russell Wilson: NFL preseason storylines that actually matterRead moreThe Star reported two more bullets hit the facility, with one striking the third floor and another an outdoor air-conditioning unit.

Reid’s next media availability is slated to be Friday night after Kansas City’s home game against the Chicago Bears, the final preseason game for both teams.No arrests have been made and no charges have been filed, though the police are treating the incident as an aggravated assault.“There is no indication this was a targeted incident at any person or organization,” Kansas City Police Department spokesperson Captain Jacob Becchina told the Star. “Because the building was occupied at the time of the bullet coming through the window, the case is being investigated as an aggravated assault.”Reid has led the Chiefs to three Super Bowl titles since the 2019 season, with the most recent coming at the end of the 2023 season.

The club’s position is straightforward: there are no suitable defenders on the market and, in any case, it is up to Maresca to find internal solutions. The Italian can call upon Josh Acheampong, who performed well against Crystal Palace on the opening weekend. The 19-year-old started with Colwill’s long-term absence complicated by Tosin Adarabioyo’s minor injury. Adarabioyo may return for Friday night at West Ham but there is a case to give Acheampong another chance next to Trevoh Chalobah. Acheampong, who counts Manchester City as one of his many suitors, stood up to Jean-Phillipe Mateta in thegoalless draw with Palace. It is worth having another look at whether he can cope as the central centre-back when Chelsea morph into a back three in possession. Replacing Colwill’s line-breaking passes will not be easy but Maresca has options.Jacob SteinbergWest Ham v Chelsea, Friday 8pm (all times BST)Spurs must put Eze behind themView image in fullscreenEberechi Eze ultimately preferred Arsenal over Tottenham.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesTottenham ride into the Etihad Stadium in the wake of the Eberechi Eze farrago. Perhaps Thomas Frank can use the crimson embarrassment of Arsenal gazumping his club for the Crystal Palace forward’s signature to inspire his men. Last November, under Ange Postecoglou, Spurs trounced Pep Guardiola’s champions 4-0. A repeat may seem unlikely given Eze’s morale-sapping choice plus Manchester City’s4-0 opening-day victory at Wolves. However, Frank and his players’ job is to be able to show fight and spirit and tenacity precisely when it is difficult. So at lunchtime on Saturday, we will find out how much of these qualities they possess.Jamie JacksonManchester City v Tottenham, Saturday 12.30pmBrentford look to Damsgaard for inspirationThings started appallingly for Keith Andrews in his new life as Brentford head coach. In the first 45 minutes of his senior managerial career, the Bees showed no identity to makelife easy for Nottingham Forest. Clearly, the lack of Yoane Wissa and the failure to replace Bryan Mbeumo will cause problems but a key absence in the East Midlands was Mikkel Damsgaard, missing after his wife gave birth. Andrews spoke of his importance to the team; unsurprising because he won of the players’ and fans’ player of the year award last season. The Dane’s return to the midfield will be imperative because Elliot Anderson and Morgan Gibbs-White dominated proceedings, unthreatened by anything akin to pressing. Alongside Damsgaard, Jordan Henderson may start after coming off the bench for his debut on Sunday. Experience will be helpful to Andrews, because he lacks it as a coach. Brentford were certainly better in the second half at Forest and the greater assurance of Damsgaard and Henderson can help their colleagues settle and forget that poor start.Will UnwinBrentford vAston Villa, Saturday 3pmBurnley need a goal threatThis feels like a game Burnley need to win already. The Clarets conceded almost a third of the entire tally of their goals-against column last seasonat Tottenham last weekend. Burnley were always going to be more porous at the back by the nature of stepping into the Premier League but on that basis, they need to find goals at the other end. Last season’s top scorer Josh Brownhill has departed and replacing his threat will be difficult. Lyle Foster started as the main striker at Spurs that was a struggle for Burnley, manageing just four shots on target. Armando Broja is waiting in the wings but needs to work on his physical condition before he can be considered for selection, understandable after his history of injury problems. A lot of pressure is placed on the Albania striker’s shoulders in the medium to long term but there is an immediate issue this weekend. If Scott Parker does not find goals, it could set the tone for what is to come.WUBurnley v Sunderland, Saturday 3pmCherries moving beyond summer exodusBournemouth’s season is never going to hinge on results at the best teams in the division but anopening-day defeat at Anfieldoffered plenty of positives. A typically buccaneering performance by Andoni Iraola’s side suggested a summer of change has not been as damaging as perhaps feared. Adrien Truffert, the left-back signed from Rennes, was particularly impressive and they have since augmented their squad with addition of Amine Adli, who was part of Xabi Alonso’s double-winning Bayer Leverkusen side in 2023-24. Ben Gannon Doak – who wishes to reflect both of his parents’ names – is another exciting arrival before hosting Wolves. Last week Dango Ouattara became the latest player to exit, for Brentford, in a deal worth up to £42.5m. A buzz does not breed guarantees but Bournemouth appear to have taken the summer exodus in their stride.Ben FisherBournemouth v Wolves, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenAdrien Truffert impressed against the defending champions in Bournemouth’s opening game of the season.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty ImagesMerino set for emergency roleAmid all the excitement aboutEberechi Eze’s impending arrival at Arsenal, spare a thought for Mikel Merino. The Spain midfielder’s prospects in his favoured position already looked bleak after the signing of compatriot Martín Zubimendi meant he started the season on the bench after spending the second half of the previous campaign filling in as a makeshift No 9. The knee injury suffered by Kai Havertz means Merino could find himself back in that position over the next few weeks given that he is the only other player in Mikel Arteta’s squad capable of replacing Viktor Gyökeres through the middle. Eze is expected to compete with Gabriel Martinelli on the left-hand side of Arsenal’s attack but can also play in midfield. The new man is unlikely to be available to face Leedsbut Merino could have an important role to play.Ed AaronsArsenal v Leeds, Saturday 5.30pmNew home, familiar Everton problemsIt is the dawn of a new era for Everton as the £800m Hill Dickinson Stadium hosts its first competitive game and 52,769 fans adapt to plush modern surroundings. There will be pre-match events to mark the occasion, a special edition programme priced £10 and wide-eyed astonishment at the complete lack of obstructed views. It is a momentous day for the club and the city but Everton will be trying to tread a fine line between celebrating their new home while ensuring the focus remains on, and the fervour behind, David Moyes’s team.Monday’s performance at Leedswas chastening for those Evertonians who had approached the new campaign with unusual optimism. Perhaps not for the Everton manager who has spent all summer calling for more improvements to his squad. Everton were fortunate to lose their opening home game of last season 3-0 against Brighton, such was the second half dominance of Fabian Hürzeler’s side, and soon lost the positive momentum they had built up in the final weeks of the previous campaign. Everton require a fresh start all round.Andy HunterEverton v Brighton, Sunday 2pmGlasner short on personnel for PalaceWe are only a week into the new season but Oliver Glasner already has concerns about a lack of squad depth at Crystal Palace. The expected departure of Eberechi Eze means Palace must act quickly to find a replacement, with Leicester’s Bilal El Khannouss and Tyler Dibling of Southampton among those considered. In the meantime, a knee injury to Daichi Kamada – who often played further forward under Glasner at Eintracht Frankfurt – could rule him out of the grudge match with Nottingham Forest on Sunday, meaning that Palace may turn toCommunity Shield penalty shootout heroJustin Devenny. The 21-year-old Northern Irishman signed from Airdrieonians in 2023, just four Premier League starts last season has very big boots to fill.EACrystal Palace vNottingham Forest, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenCrystal Palace may be forced to turn to Justin Devenny this weekend.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Nigel French/Apl/SportsphotoMount or Sesko is Amorim’s choiceFlashes of positivity for Manchester United during theirdefeat by Arsenalare all well and good but Ruben Amorim could do with improved results. United must also improve in both boxes. Will Amorim tweaks his attack on Sunday. Does Mason Mount continue as a false No 9 or is Benjamin Sesko ready to lead the line from the start? There was a feeling United were not quite as effective after Mount went off against Arsenal. He has endured a wretched few years but is a useful, influential team player when on form with the ability to create space for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Still, Sesko has not been signed to sit on the bench. The gargantuan Slovenian is a handful for anyone while a team who have struggled for goals under Amorim could do with a finisher in the starting XI.JSFulham vManchester United, Sunday 4.30pmIsak wrangle will stoke fires at St James’Matches involving Newcastle and Liverpool often contain a bit of an edge but this rerun oflast season’s Carabao Cup finalwill surely take things to a different level. Eddie Howe’s team won that showpiece yet one of their heroes of the hour, Alexander Isak, is at war with Newcastle as he endeavours to, currently rather forlornly, engineer a move to Anfield. With the Sweden striker training alone the only certainty is that Isak will not be at St James’ Park where geordie anger at Liverpool’s perceived tactics in unsettling Tyneside’s fallen idol should guarantee already febrile emotions run high. Howe is expected to field the former Everton winger, and boyhood Liverpool fan, Anthony Gordon out of position at centre-forward. Gordon, along with Isak and Fabian Schär, scored in last December’s fabulous 3-3 Premier League draw between these teams. Back then Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah scored twice in the course of a wonderful performance. The Egyptian’s duel with Howe’s likely left-back, Tino Livramento, could prove pivotal.Louise TaylorNewcastle vLiverpool, Monday 8pmExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendArsenalAston VillaBrentfordBournemouthBrighton & Hove AlbionCrystal PalacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She also had four rebounds and three assists.The WNBA first-year player record of 44 was set by Cynthia Cooper in the inaugural season of the WNBA (1997), when all players were ‘first year.’ The true rookie record was held by Candace Parker who scored 40 points in 2008.The overall WNBA recordfor points in a game is 53, a total achieved by Liz Cambage and A’ja Wilson.

This team just means so much to me.”Bueckers, who scored Dallas’ final 13 points, credited her teammates.“Just my teammates getting me open. Screening for me, running some off-ball actions, trying to get myself open looks,” she said. ”Just bringing the ball up the floor. [Luisa Geiselsoder] set amazing screens for me the entire night and then my teammates just looking for me, getting me the ball, getting me open.”Bueckers’ teammate Arike Ogunbowale, who did not play on Wednesday night, posted “ROY” [Rookie of the Year] on X.Bueckers is 60 points shy of Ogunbowale’s franchise rookie scoring record of 630 points, set in 2019.“Unreal. honored to play with you,” teammate Maddy Siegrist posted on X.Even the Sparks fans realized they were witnessing something special, cheering every Bueckers basket as she approached the record.“It means a lot specifically because people have gotten to see the struggle and people have gotten to see the injuries, and the ups and downs,” said Bueckers, who struggled with injuries at UConn.Bueckers had a chance to seal the game with the ball in her hands with 30 seconds left on the clock and a one-point lead. The rookie guard drew two defenders near the three-point arc and unselfishly passed it to the corner for Aziaha James, whose three-point attempt hit off the back of the rim. Los Angeles got the ball to their veteran guard Kelsey Plum, who dribbled down the clock before driving into the lane past multiple defenders to bank in a runner at the buzzer.Explore more on these topicsWNBADallas WingsBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

On the home team, a powerful 18-year-old prop scored three tries in aconvincing win.Quinnipiac coach Becky Carlson turned to her assistant. “Oh man,” she remembered saying. “Who’s the kid in the pink scrum cap? I’d give my right arm to have her.“And then that same fall, I had a voicemail. I saved it. And she sounds like a little kid. ‘Hello, Coach Carlson, this isIlona Maher. I just wanted to call and tell you I want to transfer from Norwich to Quinnipiac. I’m a nursing student. I would like for you to call me back.’“And I was like: ‘I didn’t have to give my right arm.’”A decade later, many would give their right arm for time with Ilona Maher. Ahead of a World Cup in England set to take the women’s game to new audiences, the 5ft 10in US center is a global star. Followed by millions on social media, areality TV contestantand swimsuit model broadcasting a message of body positivity, the kid in the pink scrum cap has become a phenomenon – easily rugby’s biggest breakout star in the 30 years since the All Blacks wing Jonah Lomustormedthe men’s stage.Maher was born in Burlington, Vermont, in August 1996, a year after Lomu lit up his World Cup in South Africa. Michael and Mieneke Maher had three daughters, all athletic. In high school, in her dad’s words, Ilona became “a multi-sport star: starting pitcher for the softball team, state all-star, state all-star for field hockey, state all-star for basketball.View image in fullscreenQuinnipiac’s Ilona Maher charges through the Army defense in 2016.Photograph: Donna Doherty/Quinnipiac University“But when she got to senior spring, she didn’t like the way the softball program was … in terms of the lack of exercise. She would say: ‘Dad, they kept us for two-and-a-quarter hours, they didn’t ever sweat it once. I’m not going to do it.’”The Mahers had a rule: you’ve got to play something. Ilona considered lacrosse or track but there was rugby too. Michael Maher found the game at college and stayed with it, propping for Mad River RFC, a club outside Stowe. While Michael played and refereed, Ilona spent a lot of time on the sidelines.“There was a rugby programme at the other high school in Burlington that allowed people from different high schools to come to it and was coached by friends of mine,” Michael Maher said. “Ilona decided to try that. Phone calls started right away.”US college sports are serious business, coaches competing to recruit the best of the best. Ilona chose Norwich, an hour south of home, once a military school. Her first year brought success on the field but the culture wasn’t a fit. And so she placed that fateful call to Quinnipiac, a small college in Hamden, CT.Quinnipiac women’s rugby had varsity status, bringing funding and focus. Most importantly to Maher, the program was led by Carlson, a coach widely known for her dedication to success on the field and equality with the men’s game off it. As Maher described it to the Guardian in July,beforea US national team gameagainst Fijiin Washington: “Having a force like that behind you, who believes in you, believes that as a program we deserve more funding, as women we deserve more, that has kind of carried over.”Carlson switched Maher from prop to center, her size and speed propelling the Bobcats to three national titles and herself tothe MA Sorensen awardfor best women’s collegiate player. Maher got her nursing degree, top of the class, alongside an intense rugby schooling. As Carlson described it, for three years, Maher and her teammates “got up at five in the morning to lift. You have breakfast, you have training … two sessions a day. You’re still talking about going through rigorous courses with nursing and all the pre-science they take. You’re doing strength and conditioning, you’re doing agility, you’re going to practice. You’re watching game film. All of it.”View image in fullscreenIlona Maher (right) flies in to try and thwart Fiji’s Litiana Vueti during an international in Washington DC.Photograph: Amy Sanderson/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockMaher graduated in 2018. There was no professional 15-a-side option for women but sevens had Olympic status. As her father tells it: “She said: ‘You know, Dad, I’m not done. I want to keep going, I think I can make the Eagles Sevens.’ Which to me seemed a little funny, because I think of that as a skinny person’s game. But boy, she just worked at it. She stayed so fit and she did it, big time.”In 2018, Maher made her US debut in Paris. Covid intervened in 2020 but at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Mahermade an impact, her play and her social media posts attracting a growing following.

Frustrated by the Eagles’ stuttering play, or her own performance, or just the questions thrown her way, her fierce edge was on display.From afar, Carlson looked on. She has experienced frustrations of her own amid 15 years at the sharp end. When Maher was there with her, she felt similar pressures.“We would go from these really big peaks to these really deep chasms,” Carlson said. “It was like: ‘Yes, this is something I can do, this is what I want to do, no, I can’t do this.’ I’m sure this is the story of a lot of high-profile athletes that we never see, because social media is what it is – it’s beautiful, everybody was birthed perfect, there were never any hard decisions, never any hard conversations.”View image in fullscreenIlona Maher is likely to be the centre of attention during US matches.Photograph: Australian Associated Press/AlamyIn reality, she says, Maher’s path to stardom has been “really hard”. Seeking to help her athlete, Carlson “had a long conversation with one of my really good friends,Becky Burleigh, who coached [record-settingUSA striker]Abby Wambachat Florida. I would be, like: ‘How did you coach Abby through this?’ Because Abby was very similar to Lo in stature, in the way she played, but also in this other sinking feeling of self doubt that never projected anywhere else. That’s not something that’s usually part of Ilona’s story.”Nor, sometimes, is Maher’s status as just another player. Before the Fiji game, at a gala dinner near the White House, Maher was in demand but stayed close to her fellow Eagles, dressed in uniform track jacket, jeans and sneakers, blending in when all were called onstage. She and sisters Olivia and Adrianna – co-hosts of a podcast,House of Maher– regularlyspeakof the need to stay grounded. Michael and Meineke Maher are certainly so, radiating positivity.At the World Cup, the American women face a stern test. Samoa should be beaten butPool Aalso includes Australia and England, overwhelming favorites to lift the trophy. Next Friday, the Eagles willkick off against the Red Rosesin Sunderland, at the Stadium of Light. Fortunately for the US, their star is well used to fame’s bright glare.At the DC gala dinner, at the Maher family table, Michael Maher looked back again to his daughter’s days at college, in the program that made her.“Ilona came in, led Quinnipiac in tries for three years,” he said. “But more important, she led in assists for three years too. Ilona loves being a playmaker.“All these people that were pooh-poohing her for wanting to play 15s, saying she doesn’t know what she’s doing? They should see her college record.

Finishing as runner-up in Melbourne and Paris andfalling in the semi-finalsat Wimbledon, Sabalenka has failed to get over the line at slams this season despite being a constant favourite. But with her powerful game and a devastating serve – especially on hard courts – she has the tools to make a deep run asthe defending championin New York. The Belarusian has racked up a total of 52 weeks as the world No 1, surpassing her compatriot Victoria Azarenka’s 51 for the 13th-most weeks atop the WTA rankings since they began in 1975. Perhaps, like Roger Federer in 2008, the 27-year-old can triumph in the final slam of the year after making two finals and a semi.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka is the defending champion at Flushing Meadows.Photograph: Wally Nell/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockCoco GauffThe love the 2023 winner receives at Flushing Meadows is palpable and it seems to elevate her game. Gauff stunned witha French Open winthis summer, but the American’s grass season was a struggle, culminating ina first-round exitat Wimbledon. The 21-year-old’s weak serve, in particular, has been a point of discussion. “I am disappointed in myself when it comes to that part of my game,” she has said. “Serving well in practice, I would like to transfer it to the matches. I am winning, having one part of my game on a crutch. So if I can stand on both feet, then I can only imagine it is going to be a lot more straightforward.” Her 23 double faults in a win against Danielle Collins in Montreal were the most in a WTA level match since 2011.View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff will want to rebound from a difficult time at Wimbledon.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty Images‘I am tough’ – Emma Raducanu on legacy of US Open win, stalking ordeal and why therapy won’t help herRead moreIga SwiatekAfter a stunning Wimbledon victory that includeda historic double bagelin the final, the Pole enters the US Open as a favourite after a difficult start to the year. The 2022 champion appears to be back to her most dominant form and with a formidable head-to-head record against most of the field, the 24-year-old may have a significant mental edge over other contenders. Since the start of the 2020 season, she has claimed the most wins at the WTA level over grand slam champions with 44.Jessica PegulaThis year the American has won three singles titles, in Bad Homburg, Charleston and Austin, and reached finals in Miami and Adelaide, but has failed to go further than the fourth round in a slam. She is coming off a third-round upset to Magda Linette in Cincinnati, where her slow movement hindered her game. At 31, her chance to win a grand slam is getting slimmer, but she has a strong record on hard courts and in New York, finishing as runner-up last year.View image in fullscreenJessica Pegula is running out of time to win a grand slam.Photograph: Robert Prange/Getty ImagesMirra AndreevaThough she has yet to win a grand slam, the 18-year-old is quickly becoming a serious contender. She has an aggressive baseline game, but her ability to keep focus when things fail to go her way needs improving. The Russian’s 36-12 record in 2025 gives her two more wins than her previous best of 34 last year, and her run to the Wimbledon quarter-finals made her the youngest player to reach the top five since Maria Sharapova.Other home hopesMadison KeysIt is a good time for American tennis. Outside Gauff and Pegula, Keys will be another name that is expected to impress in New York.

Since winning 10 matches to win the 2021 edition as a qualifier, Raducanu has not had a single victory in New York, suffering first-round losses in 2022 and 2024 and missing the 2023 tournament due to surgery. This will be her first grand slam with hernew coach, Francisco Roig, who was part of Rafael Nadal’s team from 2005 until 2022.

The Tottenham attacking midfielder underwent knee surgery in mid-May and, although the injury was serious, the extent of the lay-off he faces has until now been unclear.Losing the Sweden international, who scored 10 goals and provided 11 assists in 50 appearances for Spurs last season, is another headache for Thomas Frank, who is digesting the club beinggazumped by Arsenal for the £67.5m signature of Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze. The manager’s other key attacking midfielder, James Maddison, is a long-term casualty afterrupturing his anterior cruciate ligamentagainst Newcastle in pre-season.The pressure is on Spurs to respond to missing out on Eze with a statement signing after the failure earlier in the summer to sign Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White. They thought they had the midfielder after moving on a £60m buyout clause in his contract only for the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, to refuse to sanction the deal.Spurs have shown an interest in the Manchester City winger Savinho, although City maintain they want to keep the Brazilian. Spurs play at City on Saturday lunchtime. Whether their opponents soften their stance after the game remains to be seen.Spurs have made inquiries about Monaco’s Maghnes Akliouche. The France Under-21 international, who has burnished his reputation after two impressive seasons at Monaco, can play on the wing or through the middle. Frank is also open to signing Yoane Wissa from his former club Brentford and retains an interest in the Southampton winger Tyler Dibling, while Como’s Nico Paz is another option.Spurs have been relatively quiet so far in the transfer window. In terms of new faces, they have added Mohammed Kudus, João Paulinha, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

But even the absence of Eberechi Eze as he closes in on his £67.5m move to Arsenal could not spoil Crystal Palace’s first taste of European football as they sealed a victory in the first leg of theirConference Leagueplayoff.After a summer of uncertainty over which competition they would play in, the last thing that Oliver Glasner would have wanted was to receive a call from Eze on the morning of the game informing the Palace manager that he was not feeling well enough to play. Yet having struggled to break down well-drilled Norwegian side Fredrikstad in the first half in the absence of their talismanic England forward, Jean-Philippe Mateta’s goal calmed Palace’s nerves, even if they could not find a second that could have proved crucial as Palace attempt to secure their place in the group stages of Uefa’s third-tier competition. Glasner, who led Eintracht Frankfurt to victory in the Europa League in 2022, will know that this tie is far from over given that they must play the second leg next week on an artificial surface. Nothing is ever certain when it comes to Palace.The great teams Crystal Palace can follow in their first season in EuropeRead moreGlasner could not hide his disappointment beforehand that Eze would not feature, admitting that it had disrupted his side’s preparations. “It is not what you want to do, to change the starting XI on matchday, especially in this situation – the first time in European football forCrystal Palace,” he said before kick-off.Despite the lingering feeling of disappointment of not being able to take up their place in the Europa League, there was still a sense of anticipation on the streets of south London beforehand. The Conference League anthem was widely booed as the Palace ultras behind the goal immediately struck up their chant that takes aim at Uefa, former part-owner John Textor and the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis – all of whom have been blamed for their controversial demotion to this competition for breaking multi-club ownership regulations.Strictly speaking, Palace have played in Europe before but it was in the long forgotten Intertoto Cup in 1998 when they qualified because they were the only English team to apply for entry. That adventure lasted only two matches in 4-0 aggregate defeat against Turkish side Samsunspor and having been eliminated in a playoff while in charge of Wolfsburg, Glasner was clearly taking no chances here. Justin Devenny – who scored the winning penalty in the Community Shield victory – struggled after being handed the unenviable task of replacing Eze, although the Croatia defender Borna Sosa impressed on his full debut.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta’s header flies over Fredrikstad’s Martin BørsheimPhotograph: David Klein/ReutersFredrikstad, who capped their first season back in Norway’s top flight since 2012 by winning their domestic cup competition, lined up with five at the back and came ready to defend. They could even have snatched an equaliser when substitute Henrik Skogvold dragged his shot wide in injury-time.Without Eze to inspire them, it took Palace time to find their feet against a side that are more than half way through their league campaign and will have the weekend off before the second leg. Mateta finally forced goalkeeper Martin Børsheim into a save after 20 minutes but otherwise the vociferous group of travelling supporters had reason to feel encouraged. A speculative shot that flew way off target from Marc Guéhi – another Palace player whose future is uncertain – summed up the hosts’ frustration. The swaggering Adam Wharton looked like their most likely creative source from his deeper midfield role, although it was from a corner that Mateta was able to swivel and strike the post. That seemed to wake Palace up and Ismaïla Sarr’s header moments later was just about scrambled away to safety.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His side emerged with renewed purpose for the second half and Devenny headed over a golden opportunity from Guéhi’s cross. But, to the home crowd’s relief, they finally found the breakthrough when Mateta cleverly redirected a wayward volley from Will Hughes. Sosa could have extended their lead but he fired just over after good work from Sarr, with Glasner turning to the out-of-favour Odsonne Édouard to replace Devenny as they went on the attack. Daniel Muñoz hit the post from Jefferson Lerma’s cross and Guéhi headed wide from a corner but Fredrikstad’s defence was able to hold firm.The lack of alternatives from the bench – Romain Esse, the 20-year-old who cost around £12m from Millwall in January was surprisingly not called upon here – will only strengthen Glasner’s case for reinforcements before the transfer window closes, as he made his feelings clear after the game. But after the disruption of the last few days, Palace will still be strong favourites to finish the job next week.Explore more on these topicsConference LeagueCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Conor Bradley is in contention to replace Frimpong having recovered from a hamstring injury of his own.Frimpong suffered the setback during the Premier Leagueopener against Bournemouth, when he was replaced on the hour mark, and the head coach, Arne Slot, revealed the injury could have been worse but for the intervention of Liverpool’s medical team.Downing tools: the Premier League’s most infamous attempted forced exitsRead moreThe £29.5m signing from Bayer Leverkusen is likely to be out for four weeks but, with the first international break of the season from 1-9 September, the only games he should miss for Liverpool are Monday’s visit to Newcastle and the home match against Arsenal next Sunday.Slot said: “Conor trained for a few minutes with us today for the first time. The medical team were completely right about Jeremie and to tell me that I had to take him off because he is out until the end of the international break.“I think I got criticised a bit for taking him off. It had nothing to do with how he played but we felt he had an issue with his hamstring and by we, I mean the medical staff. They were completely right. It was a good call to take him off, otherwise he maybe would have been out for longer. We expect to have him back after the international break.”Bradley is not guaranteed to start at St James’ Park given he has been out for several weeks while Joe Gomez, another potential replacement for Frimpong, has just recovered from an achilles injury.“At the moment we only have two injuries but unfortunately it is two in the same position,” Slot added. “The good thing is we have other players that can play there. Wataru [Endo] played there for a few minutes, Dominik Szoboszlai has already played there. There are other options we can explore. Joe Gomez is definitely one of them but for him to already play 20 minutes [against Bournemouth] that is already quite a lot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They will going into that fixture on the back of a busy summer, securing Chloe Kelly on a permanent deal following her successful loan spell from Manchester City last season, adding goalkeeper Anneke Borbe from Wolfsburg and signing Liverpool duo Taylor Hinds, a former academy player, and forward Olivia Smith.Smith joined the club for a world-record fee in July, becoming the first £1m-player in women’s football and she praised the confidence placed in her potential. “It’s such a hefty price tag for such a young player,” said Smith. “I think they see the potential that I have. They see my mindset. I’m hungry, I’m driven, I want to learn, I want to grow, and I want to win things, ultimately. I think that was a big piece. The money? it’s not really a big deal for me.“At the end of the day, the price tag’s a price tag, it’s not really something I’m focused on, I’m just focused on being on the pitch and learning from a great set of players. It’s also great to see the development of women’s football and that price going up.”Smith was “on the edge of my seat” watching Arsenal’sChampions League win in May. “It was quite stressful for me, and I wasn’t even on the pitch,” she said. “It was an amazing performance by the girls, and watching it on a screen you could just see the motivation, the drive and the hunger and I knew that was something that I wanted to be a part of. That was also a massive driving factor in me joining, just looking at their mentality and what they’ve achieved in the Champions League.”Hinds, like Kelly, developed in Arsenal’s academy before leaving for her next opportunity.

He is urgently looking for reinforcements afterlosing 3-0 to Sunderlandlast Saturday but West Ham have not landed many of their top targets and found a tight budget limited by the difficulty of selling players who are on lucrative long-term deals.Transfer latest: Edson Álvarez loan gives West Ham chance to recruitRead moreThere is hope that the club, who are paying the price for ill-advised spending sprees in recent summer windows, will be able to sign two midfielders after agreeing to sendEdson Álvarez on loan to Fenerbahce. But Potter, who works closely with his recruitment chief, Kyle Macaulay, stressed that he will avoid quick fixes after being asked if he is worried about a lack of depth in several key areas.“We need a few silver bullets, not just one,” the formerChelseamanager said. “We analyse where we think the improvements can be and then we have to try to work within the financial position of the club to make the right decision to bring the right player and the right person here. If I look historically, West Ham have spent money, have signed players. Signing players is easy. It doesn’t mean that they’re going to be the right ones.“It doesn’t mean to say that the team’s going to improve. It doesn’t mean to say that in six months’ time you’re stuck with a player that’s on too much money, that’s too old and you can’t sell them. It would be nice to have £200m to spend but that’s not the case. I have to work with what I have responsibly.”Potter has won only five league games sincereplacing Julen Lopetegui. “I have no doubt whatsoever about my ability,” he said. “I have no doubt about the players and I have no doubt about the team that we’ll improve. I understand people will be critical. That’s the world we’re in. No point complaining about it. I couldn’t care less what you guys think or what people say from outside.”Potter suggested that West Ham became too emotional after going behind against Sunderland. He added that he trusts the squad’s leadership group of Nayef Aguerd, Jarrod Bowen, Niclas Füllkrug, MaximilianKilman, Tomas Soucek and James Ward-Prowse to lift the mood in the dressing room.Meanwhile, Enzo Maresca has said Wesley Fofana is happy at Chelsea despite the defender removing pictures of himself playing for the club from his Instagram account.The 24-year-old, who was an unused substitute during Sunday’s0-0 draw at home to Crystal Palace, previously did the same in 2022 as he sought a move away from Leicester, just before sealing a £70m switch to Stamford Bridge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Selected leagues are to trial the system this year, a move that will allow referee to order players of both teams to stop and retreat to their penalty area in order to prevent “escalation during heated moments in a match”.During 2023-24, the latest season for which figures are available, the FA received 4,277 allegations of serious misconduct at grassroots level, a 13% increase on the previous year. The governing body is committed to “creating safe, respectful and inclusive environments” in the grassroots game, according to its director of football development, James Kendall.“We’re clear on our position that all forms of unacceptable behaviour, whether on or off the pitch, have no place in football,” he said. “We’ve made good progress on addressing these issues, but we recognise there is still more to be done and we need to constantly adapt, develop and evolve our procedures in line with changes in the game.”The International Football Association Board (Ifab), which determines the laws of the game, authorised trials of cooling-off periods in 2024. It argued the measure could be used in instances of “significant confrontation” to “prevent further confrontations and the need for the match to be abandoned.”Any player who does not adhere to a referee’s instructions regarding a cooling-off period will receive a yellow card. Captains and coaches will then be charged with calming down their teammates before reporting back to the referee, who will use their discretion to restart play. The FA’s aim is to keep any break brief, “based on the seriousness of the situation and conditions”.Cooling-off periods is one of several measures that will be deployed in a new crackdown on discriminatory behaviour, abuse of officials and more general misconduct. They include an extension of the use of referee body-cams in all leagues with persistent disciplinary problems and the introduction of the captain’s-only protocol, whereby only the captain can discuss decisions with the referee, which is also to be adopted in the Premier League and Football League.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 27-year-old knew she was coming to a league with ambition, a league increasingly catching the attention of the best European talent, and a league that stood to benefit from a home European Championship that would catapult interest and growth further.“At Spurs I got enough support and time to kind of grow into things,” Summanen says. “I wasn’t just thrown into the deep end right away. I got the right support, right help on and off the pitch to get to where I am now. It didn’t just happen overnight, I just slowly, slowly kept building and that’s still what I want to do, keep taking steps forward.”Summanen has become a key midfield cog for Tottenham, and earned the award for the Women’s Super League goal of the month in November for her stunning 40-yard winner against Aston Villa, which was also voted Tottenham fans’ goal of the season, a goal she describes as a “one-hit wonder”. The Finland midfielder says: “It’s a good thing to keep in mind, getting goals and assists and to be part of that attacking game as well. But I’m not expecting the same kind of goal.”Her goal was a rare highlight amid a difficult season for the north London side, who finished 11th, six places lower than in the 2023-24 season, the year they also reached afirst FA Cup final. What went wrong? “To be honest, I haven’t had so much time to reflect on last season myself, because of the Euros and then having to switch on to preparing for the new season,” Summanen says. “But, obviously it didn’t go as we wished for. That’s just a learning curve for all of us in the club and in and around the team, just to remember that nothing comes for free in this league and you just need to work for it.View image in fullscreenEveliina Summanen won the Women’s Super League goal of the month award in November for her stunning 40-yard winner against Aston Villa.Photograph: George Tewkesbury/THFC“Now we have a new chance with a new coach and just a lot of new positive energy coming to the team. So, the best thing is to focus on what’s coming next and not worry too much about what happened last season. That’s in the past now and we can’t change it. At the end of the day, that’s part of football sometimes. It’s going to be tough and there will be tough times during the upcoming season as well.”The disappointing campaign led to the departure of Robert Vilahamn as manager at the end of the season. The former Manchester United assistant Martin Ho, who spent two years in Norway as manager of Brann, was appointed the club’s new head coach.“There’s not been that much time yet with him but he’s given us a lot of good energy and that’s sometimes the most important thing,” Summanen says. “Without going into too much detail, he’s just tweaking small things. It’s still quite hard to judge, but the first impression has been really good and really positive and I feel like there is a route for us to go down. There is so much more potential than what we showed last season and I think he can bring that potential out of us.”Summanen does not just have to throw off the disappointment of last season; she also has to exorcise her frustrations at Finland’s exit from the European Championship in Switzerland this summer, withRiola Xhemaili’s injury-time levellerfor the hosts ensuring the qualified from Group A ahead of the Finns. “It was a massive disappointment that we didn’t go through,” Summanen says. “That was our clear goal. We were so close to it and, in my opinion, we played well enough to deserve that chance in the knockout stage. But if you don’t win the right games you don’t get enough points, and that’s what it’s all about.”There were positives to take from the tournament for Finland; after three defeats in 2022 they at least earned four points in Switzerland. “We’ve been taking the steps in the right direction all the time,” Summanen says. “We’ve shown now at the Euros that we can compete against good teams, but we’re not there yet and the results show that. So we need to keep on working and obviously we’re focusing on challenging for the next things ahead of us when we have our next camp.”Summanen has come a long way from Lappeenranta, the small town she grew up in. “I don’t think I had any other option if I wanted to stay in my home town than to play with the boys. So that was kind of put on the table for me and I felt like that was the best thing to do so I could be more at home and where I have my family support around me, which has always been massive. Now, there’s more and more options for younger players, younger girls, to play with and against girls. You have more teams, you have more competition.”Competition couldn’t be fiercer than in the WSL. “I think the English league is the best in the world,” Summanen says. “There are more and more Finnish players coming to the league, which is really good for us. And the Finnish girls are also getting good roles in their teams, not just being rotation players.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Events at the final hole of the ­opening round of the Tour Championship barely compared with what played outat Augusta National in Aprilbut these were still moments of ­McIlroy box office. No wonder he stood ­laughing with arm aloft.McIlroy found himself in a ­greenside bunker in two at the par-five 18th. He caught his attempt from the sand trap far too cleanly, the ball ­flying over the flag and rebounding from a grandstand. The bounce was favourable; McIlroy had 17ft left for a birdie. The putt found the bottom of the cup, much to the amusement of McIlroy and his playing partner ­Scottie ­Scheffler. McIlroy’s 66 at East Lake leaves him five shy of the first-round lead after Russell Henley’s stunning 61.Tiger Woods takes up PGA role but unification in golf is as distant as ever | Ewan MurrayRead moreThis was a fine day for Keegan ­Bradley, were he not in the midst of the toughest choice of his professional career. Henley will play under ­Bradley for the United States in the Ryder Cup next month. Scheffler continued his excellent form with a 63, including a back half of just 31. The 64s of ­Patrick Cantlay, Collin Morikawa and Justin Thomas were notable with that trio likely to receive captain’s picks from Bradley. The key dilemma surrounds whether Bradley is also going to select himself, thereby becoming the first playing captain in a Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer in 1963.Bradley’s 70 here hardly added to the conversation. The 39-year-old did not hang around for media duties. Significant in this debate is what Bradley’s peers will tell him to do. The mood music ­suggests they want Bradley on this team. “Yeah, I would,” said Thomas when asked whether he would pick Bradley. “It is a lot [to handle both jobs]. I think Keegan would say the same. I don’t think he would say it’s easy by any means. But myself, whatever other [vice-]captains, automatic qualifiers have all the faith in the world that whatever he decides to do is going to be in the best interest of the team.”Morikawa outlined the trickiness of the scenario: “I think he’s got one of the most difficult decisions ­anyone has ever had to make. He has put more hours than we could even ask and know about into this Ryder Cup and he still has played great golf. He is one of the best Americans as of right now. But I truly do not know where his head sits and I don’t want to be in that position.View image in fullscreenTommy Fleetwood continuted his good form with a 64 at East Lake to be tied third after the first round of the Tour Championship.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA“If you lose, every reason is going to come up. At the end of the day, we lost in Rome because we played bad golf and they played great golf. That’s what it comes down to.”There are European colours on the leaderboard.

But with Eze having pulled out on the morning of the game citing illness after Arsenal agreed a fee worth up to £67.5m for the England forward on Wednesday evening, they struggled to break their opponents down and Parish acknowledged that it is imperative Palace are decisive in the transfer market.Mateta gives Crystal Palace advantage over Fredrikstad in Conference playoffRead more“He’s been fantastic for the club,” he said of Eze on Channel 5. “We all love him for what he’s done and what he’s achieved and we’re pleased that he’s going to go on and fulfil the other ambitions that he’s got. But the king is no longer the king, right? We have to move past it and we have to find other players to bring in that could support the rest of the team and Oliver.” Parish also admitted that Marc Guéhi could still epart Palace with Liverpool interested in signing the Palace captain, who has entered the final year of his contract.“If Marc wants to sign a contract, then he can stay. If he doesn’t want to sign a contract, then we have to look at it,” he said. “It’s a difficult situation. Every club like us, and particularly if you’re in Europe, the financial rules are a lot tighter than the Premier League. They’re a lot tighter. Everybody has to sell players to, you know, comply with the rules. So that’s a situation we’ll have to look at in the next 11 days.”But Glasner was only half-joking when he suggested that Guéhi’s departure before next week’s second leg would force the former defender into considering playing himself.“I just know if Marc leaves, and is not available for Fredrikstad, we would have big problems,” he said. “It’s pretty clear. We can’t register anyone. So from my side, he has to stay. You see, we played with Jefferson Lerma in the back today. He’s a midfield player. We have no centre-backs available at the moment, and if Marc leaves, OK, maybe I will ry my boots, because I was a centre-back and this could be a good option. I will think about it.”Palace have spent the least amount of any club in Europe’s top five leagues and have earmarked Leicester’s Bilal El Khannouss as a potential replacement for Eze.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For clarity, teams very rarely defeat Hull KR: this is only the fourth time they have tasted defeat in 2025 and two of them have been by the Rhinos. It is also the first time they have lost by 20 points or more in almost 18 months.This was not just a victory for Brad Arthur’s side. It was a statement that Super League title No 9 may not be too far away for a team who are rejuvenated under the guidance of the Australian. Back-to-back eighth-placed finishes in 2023 and 2024 seem a distant past; this is now a side capable of going the distance this autumn.RFL under pressure to produce rugby league action plan to avoid funding cutsRead moreFor 80 minutes here, Headingley felt like the good old days when league titles were more of a formality than they were a possibility. With a raucous crowd behind them and Leeds playing a wonderful brand of rugby, they blew the Super League leaders away from start to finish.In doing so, they breathed new life into their push for a place in the top two come the playoffs. The League Leaders’ Shield is doubtless heading toHull KR, but second place is now firmly up for grabs, with Leeds level on points with Wigan with four rounds remaining – and that brings with it huge positives come the playoffs.The top two get a bye through the opening round of the play-offs and a home semi-final too. All of a sudden, few would back against Leeds. Leading 18-0 at half-time thanks to tries from Jake Connor, Presley Cassell and Lachie Miller, there was never much chance of a Rovers comeback on an off-night for them, but a stellar one for Leeds.“I feel like it’s been building towards that,” Arthur said following their best performance of 2025. Miller was at the heart of everything they did well, laying on a try for Connor before Cassell, the latest product of their fine academy, surged through to make it 12-0.Miller then rounded the Hull KR defence to make it 18-0 long before the half-hour mark. Having delivered a wonderful display at the reigning champions, Wigan Warriors, last week, this was perhaps an understandably low-key evening for Rovers. But the standards they have set in recent years means this will be a difficult night to review.“It wasn’t a good performance or result,” their coach, Willie Peters, said. “They had more aggression and intent, and they strolled through us.” Any notion of a Hull KR comeback had to come through an early try after half-time to breathe life into the contest, but Leeds’ defensive efforts meant that felt unlikely.View image in fullscreenLachlan Miller scored Leeds’ third try against Hull KR to help them to an 18-0 lead.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThere were half-chances, but the Rhinos always felt in control of proceedings. Connor’s penalty to make it a four-score lead only emphasised that further before another scintillating attacking move led to Harry Newman scoring their fourth try of the night.Another penalty from the boot of Connor as Rovers continued to toil then made it 28-0 and at that stage, the prospect of Hull KR being beaten to nil for the first time since May 2022 appeared to be on the cards. They at least avoided that ignominy when Tom Davies crossed in the corner with five minutes left, but the damage had long since been done and the statement long since been made.Perhaps it was fitting Leeds delivered a performance like this here too, on the night when the late, great Rob Burrow’s family were in attendance. How he would have absolutely loved his beloved Rhinos producing something quite as emphatic as this.Explore more on these topicsRugby leagueLeeds RhinosHull KRSuper LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

She does everything right, she gets the mile and a half well but she could probably come back [in trip], and she seems to handle slow ground and quick ground. She’s professional and does everything nicely and she has plenty of options.”The most obvious possibilities are one or both of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in early October and the Breeders’ Cup Turf at Del Mar a month later, though Whirl is also a leading candidate for the same events.“We’ve always felt the better the race, the better she’ll be,” O’Brien said. “She’s won well in the end, our filly, she obviously stays very well and always finishes her race off well. She doesn’t kill herself getting there but she’s always finishing.“She has to be close to the top of our pecking order for the Arc, she’s an improving filly at this time of year. She could go to the Breeders’ Cup Turf but also the Arc [and] Whirl could go with her.”Fillies continue to dominate the Arc betting after Thursday’s race, with Andrew Balding’s Kalpana, the King George runner-up, narrowly favoured at around 7-1, with Whirl and Minnie Hauk at 9-1 and 10-1 respectively.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Friday tipsShowNewmarket12.50 Rajaking 1.20 Ten Pounds 2.00 Enchanted Queen 2.35 Monoceros 3.10 Angel Shared 3.45 Huggable 4.20 VenezuelanYork1.50 French Duke (nb) 2.25 Trawlerman 3.00 Lifeplan 3.35 She’s Quality (nap) 4.10 Zgharta 4.45 Naval Light 4.45 Sea ForceFfos Las2.10 Navid 2.45 Lost Signal 3.20 Cypriot Diaspora 3.55 Step Along 4.30 The Pug 5.00 Sea Of CharmHamilton5.05 August George 5.35 Seren Star 6.05 Tiernan 6.35 Defiance 7.05 Naana’s Sparkle 7.35 The Good Biscuit 8.05 Global EffortGoodwood5.15 Joycean Way 5.48 Coconut Cove 6.18 Noche Clasica 6.48 Eternal Blessing 7.18 On Edge 7.48 Kiss And RunWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Friday tips: A Quality pick in NunthorpeTen juveniles have tried and failed to take advantage of the weight concession from their older rivals since Kingsgate Native’s success in the Nunthorpe Stakes in 2007, but that has not deterred the connections of Lady Iman and Spicy Marg, who will face 15 rivals in the feature race on day three of York’s Ebor Festival.Both are fillies and so get the maximum allowance, with just 8st 2lb to carry, and Lady Iman, unbeaten at the five-furlong trip, is the narrow favourite at around 5-1 in the early betting for what is an exceptionally open renewal of the meeting’s big sprint.View image in fullscreenShe’s Quality (right) can atone for a narrow Goodwood defeat by Jm Jungle when they meet again in the Nunthorpe at York.Photograph: Ian Headington/racingfotos.com/ShutterstockIn all, a dozen of the 17 runners are priced up at between 5-1 and 20-1, for a race that has had winners at 100-1, 40-1 twice and 28-1 over the last 15 years.Timeform’sratings confirm that there is very little to choose between the majority of the field, and that while Lady Iman undoubtedly has more scope for improvement than most of her rivals, she still has something to find with several runners at bigger odds.Solid alternatives include Jm Jungle, who has excellent track form and put up a career best to win the Group Two King George Stakes at Goodwood last time, but fillies and mares have a fine record in the Nunthorpe in recent years and York is also likely to play to the strengths of the runner-up there,She’s Quality(3.35).Jack Davison’s filly has been second on all four of her starts this season, and showed impressive speed to lead until well inside the final furlong in the Charge at Sandown on Eclipse day. She should see things out better on the Knavesmire and is an interesting bet at around 10-1 to give her a trainer a first Group One success.York 1.50French Dukehas struggled to get involved from tricky draws at Ascot and Goodwood on his last two starts, but deserves one more chance to rediscover his promising three-year-old form in a smaller field, and at a track that gives his rider more room for manoeuvre.York 2.25John and Thady Gosden’sTrawlermanestablished himself as the leading stayer in Britain with a seven-length success in the Ascot Gold Cup last time and a 3lb penalty for that win is unlikely to prevent him following up.York 3.00This is not the strongest renewal of the Gimcrack by any stretch and the likely favourite, Do Or Do Not, is still a maiden after five starts, so the way could be open for the once-racedLifeplanto follow up his cosy debut success at Thirsk in July.York 4.10Zghartahad no luck at all in running at Goodwood last time and will be strongly fancied to make amends off the same mark.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, she could face the in-form 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova, a recent semi-finalist at the Cincinnati Open, in round two.

This time, she is as match-tough as she has been over the past few years, establishing a consistently high level over the past few months and pushing Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, to a final-set tie-break intheir three-hour ­tussle in Cincinnati. Now ranked No 35, Raducanu missed out on being seeded in New York by just one spot.In his return to singles competition, after missing the entire US hardcourt swing, Raducanu’s fellow British player Jack Draper will also face a qualifier or lucky loser in his opening-round match. Draper, seeded fifth, has not competed in singles since Wimbledon after being diagnosed with a left forearm injury. However, he looked healthy and well prepared during hissemi-final run in the mixed doublesalongside Jessica Pegula this week.One year on fromhis breakthrough run to the US Open semi-final, Draper has been drawn in Jannik Sinner’s quarter, but a quarter-final rematch with his old friend is a long way away with quality opponents such as Gabriel Diallo, Lorenzo Musetti and Flavio Cobolli in his section.The women’s field is headed by Sabalenka, who will open her defence against the world No 109, Rebeka Masarova of Switzerland. Rybakina, who she could meet in the quarter-finals, is the most dangerous player in her section before the semi-finals and Pegula, the fourth seed, is the second-highest seed in the top half.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner had to retire from the final in Cincinnati on Monday but was practising in New York on Thursday.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesCoco Gauff, the third seed, has been drawn in No 2-seeded Iga Swiatek’s half of the draw as she tries to find her way again after a difficult period since herFrench Open win in June.

Sinner will begin his defence against Vit Kopriva of the Czech Republic and, along with a potential quarter-final against Draper, the third seed Alexander Zverev is his projected semi-final opponent.Alcaraz, however, has been handed a challenging first-round opponent in the big-serving Reilly Opelka, a former No 17 who stands at 6ft 11in. While the fourth seed Taylor Fritz –last year’s beaten finalist– is Alcaraz’s projected semi-final opponent by seeding, the seventh seed Novak Djokovic, who has been the best grand slam performer behind Sinner and Alcaraz this year with three consecutive semi-finals, looms in Fritz’s quarter. The 38-year-old has not competed since Wimbledon.Plenty of tough first-round ties await the rest of the British contingent.

As the only doubles specialist team in a tournament that had banished the rest of their kind, they were on a mission to prove their worth by succeeding on the court.Shortly before midnight on an Arthur Ashe Stadium still filled with raucous spectators, the mission was complete. They triumphed in spectacular fashion at the reimagined US Open mixed doubles championship by closing out the star singles pairing of Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud, the third seeds, 6-3, 5-7 (10-6) in a supreme, intense tussle to defend their title.Ever since the US Open announced its transformed mixed doubles tournament six months ago, which has been moved forward to the US Open’s qualifying week and rebranded as a shortened format with an entry criteria that overwhelmingly favours singles players, Vavassori and Errani have been two of its biggest critics.Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori win ‘reimagined’ US Open mixed doubles tournament – as it happenedRead moreA wildcard pairing due to their victory last year, they entered this tournament determined to back up those criticisms by proving the value of doubles players on the court. As they have marched through the draw, many of their doubles specialist peers have offered their full support. “I think this one is also for the doubles players that couldn’t play this tournament,” said Errani afterwards.In a draw filled with many of the best tennis players in the world, Errani and Vavassori made a decisive case for the importance of teamwork in this discipline. They demonstrated the value of sharp, decisive netplay, strategy, formations and intelligence by on the court. They were always one step ahead of the opponent and they imposed relentless pressure with their suffocating brilliance at the net.After blazing through to the final without dropping a set, the title was decided in an incredible match defined by sharp contrasts, the teamwork, tactical nous and shifting formations of the Italian pair against the baseline supremacy of Swiatek and Ruud, who spent the night eviscerating forehands as they tried to pierce the Italian wall at the net. They then launched a spectacular comeback to force a final set match tiebreak before the Italians closed out the match. “You proved that mixed doubles players are smarter tactically than singles players, I guess,” said Swiatek.While the victors made their points clear, in many ways the US Open organisers also did. This event has generated criticism for a wide variety of reasons, from the way it disposed of the doubles specialists to the changes imposed by the US Open without any input from the players themselves.This tournament’s aim, however, was to create a bigger stage for a format the organisers deemed obsolete, and the interest it has generated is undeniable. Four days before the start of the US Open, a completely full Arthur Ashe stadium was on hand to witness the climax of an event that had become little more than a footnote in recent years.View image in fullscreenOne year on from their triumph over a field of specialists, the best mixed doubles team in the world reaffirmed their supremacy by beating the singles superstars.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPAThe evening began with Swiatek and Ruud ousting the top seeds Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper in the first semi-final. During their warmup, the on-court MC suggested that Ruud could win his first grand slam title by the end of the night and described Draper as a two-time grand slam semi-finalist. They were extremely jarring claims that underlined another significant point of contention: should this event be categorised as a grand slam title or, considering its shortened format and restrictive entry conditions, is it simply an exhibition?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionPerhaps neither of these definitions are suitable and this is simply a special event in its own category. While some teams, such as Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, participated for the good vibes, this second night presented an intense, high quality evening of tennis. It is obvious that the singles players have far greater priorities, and they will not lose sleep over losing a mixed doubles event in their training week before the real tournament begins, but they are also intensely competitive and they each competed on Wednesday with determination and full effort.At a time when numerous global sports, such as athletics, swimming and even gymnastics, have introduced mixed-gender team events, this event is also a reminder of tennis’s failure to properly take advantage of one of its unique selling points: the fact that the top male and female players share the stage at the biggest tournaments. A distinct feature of mixed doubles, compared to those other mixed-gender events, is that the female players are more than capable of holding their own and making decisive winning plays against their male counterparts. For most of the first semi-final match, for example, Pegula was the best player on the court.In general, the two days of competition were great fun. This tournament included the unforgettable sight of 45-year-old Venus Williams tussling with Andrey Rublev from the baseline, acing him while trailing match point during Karolina Muchova and Rublev’s win over Williams and Reilly Opelka. A month after returning a 153mph serve at Wimbledon, Taylor Fritz at times struggled with Sara Errani’s 70mph first serves. Most notably, one year on from their triumph over a field of specialists, the best mixed doubles team in the world reaffirmed their supremacy by beating the singles superstars. For their efforts, they earned $1m prize money, a handsome pay rise of $800k in just one year.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Businesses close and the city nearly grinds to a halt. Among those who remain, there is an eternal, quintessentially Parisian quest: hunting for a balmyterrassebathed in sunlight for an evening apéritif.Finding the perfect seat on the pavement outside a cafe may be a matter of a chance stroll or a timely text from a friend. This summer, though, a digital solution has gained popularity in an extremely French instance of the old Apple slogan “there’s an app for that”: Jveuxdusoleil, an app that tracks the sun’s movement through the city’s maze of buildings to pinpoint exactly where you can claim a sunny spot on a terrace for your coffee. It arrives at a precarious moment for this particularly Parisian pursuit.‘Own less, have more’: French app rents out underused household itemsRead moreJean-Charles Levenne created Jveuxdusoleil (“I want sun”) in 2020 as a side project in an effort to teach himself app development and solve a personal problem: finding shade during hot days as well as sunny spots for the Parisian ritual of post-work drinks.Using sun-positioning algorithms and building-height data from the open-source map platform OpenStreetMap, Levenne’s app displays sunny terraces, while darkened ones disappear. Users can also request new spots through the app or note when it is not accurate (a tree casting a previously unaccounted for shadow, for example), making it a constantly evolving, community-driven tool. While the technology is working in other cities, most of the terraces on the app are located in Paris, where Levenne says it is particularly useful.“This app is working worldwide but it has originally been focused on Paris because there is more need than in other French cities,” he said. “With narrow streets and tall buildings, it’s not always easy to find a sunny spot.”Terraces function as observation posts from which to view Paris – chairs are often positioned on either side of the small bistro tables, facing the street rather than each other and allowing diners to observe the world passing by. With France’s lack of tipping culture, there is less pressure to quickly turn over tables to make more profit. One could order a single cup of espresso for less than €2 and stay for hours – making the terrace something of a second living room for Parisians.Pierrick Bourgault, a photographer and journalist who has written about 20 books and releaseda documentaryabout bistro culture in France, said terraces in Paris offer one of the most authentic windows into the city.“The terrace is emblematic of a certainart de vivre[art of living], as we say in France – a place where all kinds of people meet,” Bourgault said. “You’re not alone in an enclosed space. It’s a bit like [being in] the street, with one foot inside and one foot outside. You’re immersed in the city, and the spectacle of life.”In search of sun after the darkest winter in decadesJveuxdusoleil’s user base has climbed steadily in the years since its launch – with more than 1,300 active users in the week preceding my interview with Levenne, who has departed the tech world and called me from a yacht he now captains in the Balearic islands off the coast of Spain. App usage spikes in the spring, when Parisians are desperate for sunlight after the notoriously dreary winter months.This year, Jveuxdusoleil saw a peak of almost 20,000 visitors in just one week in early March after France experienced thedarkest year in 30 yearsin 2024. Paris in particular enduredmultiple stretchesof nearly a week at a time without a single ray of sunshine during the winter months. Jveuxdusoleil is entirely a passion project, and Levenne makes no profit from it. “In fact, it costs me money to host the servers,” he said.A Paris-based photographer I spoke with, who uses the app both to find sunny streets for shooting and terraces to enjoy drinks with friends, said the uncomplicated nature of Jveuxdusoleil is part of its appeal. Its features are minimal: with just one slider that determines time and sunlight, it positions itself as a kind of anti-everything app.Can an app revive decliningterrasseculture?While usership of Jveuxdusoleil is not necessarily widespread – many young French people I spoke with on the terraces of Paris had never heard of the app – its existence indicates a technological embrace of bistro culture in France at a crucial time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The document also stated that in Paris the number of bistros has declined from 5,000-6,000 in the 1970s-80s to just over 1,000 today. A coalition of French bistro ownerssuccessfully securednational recognition in September 2024. They have similarlybeen campaigning since 2018for Unesco World Heritage status for their establishments.Bourgault attributes this “massacre”, which has decreased the density of bistros in France over the last century from one cafe per 100 inhabitants to one per 2,000, to a barrage of continuing threats. The rise of automobiles and highways has diverted traffic from such establishments across the country, while television, smartphones and digital communications have replaced the need to meet friends at the local terrace. The report by bistro owners likewise cites globalization and changing consumer preferences as risks to bistro culture.Unconventional dating app Feeld reports surge in ‘vanilla tourists’Read moreA 1941 law prohibits new cafe creation and only allows takeovers of existing licenses, keeping the number of bistros relatively stagnant while soaring real estate prices, particularly in Paris, have made both running and patronizing these establishments less financially viable. French commentators have long lamented the “Americanisation of Paris”, withsome notingthat, as more traditional bistros close, McDonald’s is spreading quickly across France and becoming a de facto meeting place for many young people.Bourgault said the rise of technology has contributed to the decline of bistros; people can order delivery on their phones, and when they do go out they often stay glued to their devices instead of chatting with strangers at thecomptoir. It’s ironic then, he noted, that an app could in fact strengthen the bistro culture of Paris.“With its geographical visualization, the app situates you in the concrete world – it reminds us that we’re on earth, it reminds us that there’s a sun that moves, the earth that turns,” he said.“When we meet friends at a bistro for a drink, we aren’t meeting in the cloud – we are meeting in a cafe with distinct personality, characters and decor,” he added. “We know we are not two artificial intelligences [in the process] of exchanging digital protocols. We talk to each other, and without a shadow of a doubt, we know it is real.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyFrance (World news)France (Weather)EuropeEurope holidaysnewsShareReuse this content"

What is Kick, what happened, and what could happen next?What happened?Raphaël Graven, 46, from southern France and known online as Jean Pormanove, had built a profile on Kick, where he had reportedly gained over a million followers.Hedied during an extended live stream on the platform this week. Leading up to his death,he wasallegedly physically assaulted and humiliated by co-streamers as viewers watched. Excerpts of hours-long videos, which the Guardian has seen, appear to show Graven being hit, insulted, strangled, and shot at with a paintball gun.His channel has since been removed, and the co-streamers have been banned while Kick investigates.A lawyer for one of the co-streamers told local media that Graven had cardiovascular problems and the scenes “are just staged, they follow a script”.An autopsy has been ordered, and there is a police investigation into Graven’s death.What is Kick?Kick is a livestreaming platform similar to Twitch where people often watch people playing video games or doing other activities.It was founded in Melbourne in 2022 by billionairesEd Craven and Bijan Tehrani. Craven founded one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency casinos, Stake.com, and Kick grew its user base by luring Twitch streamers who had been sponsored by Stake on Twitch before the Amazon-owned company banned gambling advertising.French streamer dies live online after months of apparent mistreatmentRead moreKick states that content creators keep 95% of the revenue from their streams.Kick has a reputation of having a lighter approach to content moderation than Twitch, but has community guidelines that do not permit “content that depicts or incites abhorrent violence including significant harm, suffering or death”.The platform also states it does not permit content which involves displays of serious and significant self-harm.Earlier this year, the company also announced it would only allow gambling streams from sites that use ID verification, to prevent minors from being exposed to such content.Why was the channel not banned?A spokesperson for Kick did not say why the Jean Pormanove channel had not been banned prior to Graven’s death.“We are urgently reviewing the circumstances and engaging with relevant stakeholders to investigate the situation,” the spokesperson said. “Kick’s community guidelines are designed to protect creators, and we remain committed to upholding these standards across our platform.”What has Kick said about the death?The company has said it is cooperating with the investigation, and it was saddened about Graven’s death.“We are deeply saddened by the loss of Jean Pormanove and extend our condolences to his family, friends and community.”Will Kick face any repercussions?In France, the country’s junior minister for AI and digital technology, Clara Chappaz, said the death and the violence Graven allegedly suffered “are absolutely horrific” and said a judicial investigation was under way. The matter was also referred to the digital regulator Arcom, as well as France’s portal for reporting concerns about internet content.Given Kick is an Australian company, there may also be local implications.A spokesperson for the eSafety commissioner said it was a “tragic case” that underscores “how the creation of more extreme content … can have devastating, real-world consequences”.The spokesperson said “platforms like Kick need to be doing more to enforce their own terms of use and minimise harmful content and conduct in streams to protect all users of the service”.Given the chat functionality in Kick, the platform could come under the Australiangovernment’s under-16s social media banfrom December, the spokesperson said.Separate from that, industry codes and standards in effect also currently require companies like Kick to have systems to safeguard Australians from content, including that which depicts crime or violence without justification.“This includes requirements to enforce their terms of use prohibiting such material, and to deal with user reports appropriately and promptly,” the spokesperson said. “eSafety will use the full range of our enforcement powers as appropriate where there is non-compliance, which can include seeking penalties of up to A$49.5m.”Other codes aimed at addressing children’s access to high-impact violence are under consideration.The more governments try to restrict social media use, the more young people will find ways to get around it | Leo PuglisiRead moreHas this happened on other services before?There have been multiple incidents of people’s deaths being livestreamed on the internet. In 2016, a Chicago manwas shot and killedwhile livestreaming on Facebook.The Christchurch massacre in 2019was livestreamed on Facebook for 17 minutes.In 2020, a Mississippi man killed himself during a live stream on Facebook.Following Christchurch, Metaimplemented changesto detect such content and remove it, and prevent it being spread.

Other locals complained datacentres were intrusive and noisy and provided few jobs, although the applicant, Greystoke, claims it will create about 230 jobs and support hundreds more in the wider economy.Following an appeal against the refusal, a public inquiry favoured consent, concluding that no environmental impact assessment was needed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

And while the Iver datacentre is proposed to be air-cooled, many usevast quantities of water. In March, Thames Waterwarnedthat its region was “seriously water-stressed … and yet there could be as many as 70 new datacentres in our area over the next few years, with each one potentially using upwards of 1,000 litres of water per second, or the equivalent of 24,000 homes’ usage”.A spokesperson for Greystoke said Rayner had reached the right decision and recognised that the datacentre “meets a vital national need for digital infrastructure, and will bring over £1bn of investment, transforming a former landfill site next to the M25”.“Modern datacentres play a key role in advancing scientific research, medical diagnostics and sustainable energy,” they said. “The datacentre campus incorporates measures which benefit the environment, including appropriate building standards, solar panels and heat pumps.”The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government declined to comment on threats of legal action.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

She has just successfully argued in front of a court that a river running through the fictional version of the Indian city of Muziris should have the same rights as a person. According to Kuyili, this has precedent – after all, companies can argue in court similarly to individual people.The excitement over this historic win doesn’t last long as, soon after, the river is polluted by a large oil spill, which catches fire, the toxic smoke enveloping several neighbourhoods. Pollution on this scale has devastating effects, so Kuyili and her colleagues begin investigating.All Will Rise is effectively a deck-building game built around verbal sparring. In order to prepare for an important conversation, you first send Kuyili and her colleagues to different people in the community to gather information. Those trips net you cards, which you can then use as arguments. Claims cards can appeal to different emotions and each one has a different validity based on the information you have gathered. Saying that a corporation’s illegal waste disposal is responsible for the pollution of the river, for example, may get your opponent fired up, but if the card is mere speculation, as opposed to something you can back up with definitive proof, they may reject it.View image in fullscreenVerbal sparring … All Will Rise.Photograph: Speculative AgencyWhile it’s a lot to absorb at first, the card-based conversations aim to represent the many ways a conversation can go. While developer Speculative Agency cites courtroom comedy Ace Attorney as one of its inspirations, shouting “Objection!” will not necessarily get you what you want here.“Talking to people in All Will Rise is based on the idea that you often partner with another person when you’re having a conversation,” Speculative Agency’s co-founder and producer Niels Monshouwer says. “In Dutch we use the wordgesprekspartner, conversational partner, for the person you’re talking to, and conveying that feeling of partnering with someone was important to us.”In conversation and information gathering, characters expend emotional energy, a system based on what it can take out of you to engage in activism or simply keep up with the news. “Looking at the state of the world, we experience the same pain that everybody in their right mind is having,” says narrative director Meghna Jayanth. “But every time we meet, we feel empowered, stronger, happier. There are so many people out there trying to do the right thing. Don’t stay alone – organise, collaborate. This is where you will feel strong. We want the game to give people that feeling, and hopefully take that back out into the real world.”All Will Rise is not only set in India. Each chapter will shed light on the environmental challenges in a different part of the world and people’s efforts to counteract them. “We haven’t completely decided yet, but we are thinking about Puerto Rico, the Netherlands and maybe Nigeria,” says Monshouwer. “The first case deals more with pollution, corporate exploitation and local government corruption. But we’re also thinking about topics such as biodiversity loss, climate change and destruction of ocean floors due to mining.”View image in fullscreen‘Inappropriately joyful’ … All Will Rise.Photograph: Speculative AgencySpeculative Agency, which is planning a Kickstarter campaign to raise funding for the game, wants to include countries its developers are based in, which Monshouwer feels is crucial for tackling these subjects with authenticity. Another important driver for the studio is the work of its science and impact director, Joost Vervoort, who is an associate professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, working at the intersection of games and sustainability. Vervoort’s research group Anticiplay, has already explored how the climate crisis can be dealt with in games and is working to make sure All Will Rise can empower players with real-life facts around climate activism.The team has found that while the number of games tackling real-world issues is rising, there is still a lot of space for improvement. “In our first chat together we found that too many games that deal with climate change, pollution or other forms of societal collapse fall into two categories: green god games and toxic wasteland games,” says Monshouwer.“Toxic wasteland games are games where the collapse is a backdrop and the message is that there is no hope. Green god games put you into the shoes of an omnipotent being that decides where to put magic machines that clean up pollution. It oversimplifies the problem to a technical instead of a societal one, and nobody in the world has that much power. We wanted to make games about the process of change and what you can do as an individual within a community, instead of being the lone hero.”While the subjects that All Will Rise tackles are heavy, Jayanth says that it is a joyful game at its core. The team has even described the game as “inappropriately joyful” given, well, everything. “If we look around at the world right now, it would be easy to say it’s inappropriate to feel joy,” says Jayanth, who has long used her position in the gaming industry for activism. “But joy powers transformation. Rage does too, and we have plenty of that in the game as well. But we as a team feel like hope is the only useful political response to the challenges facing us all.”Ultimately, All Will Rise is meant to show that it’s never too late to get involved in activism, even though the challenge can feel daunting. “Our ideal reaction to the game would certainly be if someone went out and got involved,” Jayanth says. “There are many more types of activism than tying yourself down somewhere or joining a demonstration, and we hope people will feel inspired to give it a try.”All Will Wise is set for release on PC, date is to be confirmedExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsIndie gamesStrategy gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s about democracyThu 21 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 12.29 EDTShareIt may be difficult for a real-estate mogul like Donald Trump to recognize, but Vladimir Putin’s invasion ofUkraineis not about slices of war-torn land in eastern Ukraine. It is about Ukraine’s democracy. Putin fears that the Russian people will see that democracy as an enticing alternative to his stultifying autocratic rule. Trump is unlikely to secure a peace deal unless he acts on that reality and changes the cost-benefit analysis behind Putin’s continuing war.Much of the public analysis of the Alaskasummitbetween Trump and Putin, and the Washington collection ofEuropean leadersprotecting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, from the temperamental Trump, has been replete with red-herring issues. For example, Putin did not invade Ukraine because of fearedNatoexpansion. Theunanimousconsent of all Nato members required to admit Ukraine is nowhere on the horizon, especially sincearticle 5of the Nato treaty would require all Nato members to defend Ukraine from the ongoing Russian incursion.Ironically, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has strengthened Nato. It encouraged Sweden and Finland tojointhe alliance. It led Nato members to vow to dramatically increase their defense expenditures to5%of their gross domestic product. And it has made some Nato membersmorelikely to deploy troops in Ukraine as part of a “reassurance force” to secure a possible peace deal.Nor did Putin invade toliberatethe Ukrainian people from the rule of Zelenskyy, whom he regards asillegitimateand even a “neo-Nazi”. This claim is rich because Zelenskyy was chosen in a free and fairelection, but Putin risked only anelectoral charadewhile imprisoning, ultimatelylethally, his most charismatic opponent, Alexei Navalny.And the war is not about Putin’s pining to resurrect the Soviet Union, whose collapse heseesas “the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century”. That logic would endanger the other 13 former Soviet states, three of which – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – are Nato members.Rather, Putin invaded Ukraine to quash its democracy. Unlike the established democracies of Europe, Ukraine looks too much like Russia for Putin to ignore the possibility that Russians will see an alternative future in its accountable, elected government. Like Russia, Ukraine is Slavic and Orthodox. And far from a small statelet, Ukraine, with thesecondlargest population among post-Soviet states after Russia, cannot be ignored.Putin has long preferred Ukraine as a Kremlin vassal state. TheEuromaidanprotests of 2013-14, which ousted Ukraine’s pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych after hesuspendedtalks for a closer relationship with the European Union, led to Putin’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea and parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.Today, Putin’s most controversial demands would enhance the possibility of Kyiv’s renewed subordination. His insistence that Ukraine hand over large portions of Donetsk province – the “land swaps” that Trump casually suggests – would relinquishfar moreland than Russia has managed to take by force since November 2022, at enormous cost in Russian soldiers’ lives – land that had been home tohundreds of thousandsof Ukrainians.It would also compel Ukrainian forces to abandon keydefensive lines– Ukraine’s “fortress belt’’– that stand in the way of Russianseizureof much larger chunks of territory. Comparisons with Neville Chamberlain’s 1938 appeasement of Adolf Hitler bysacrificingCzechoslovakia’s Sudetenland – a prelude to war – would be inevitable. Putin’s demand that Ukrainedisarmwould make Russia’s further aggression even easier.Precluding that possibility is why security guarantees are so important for Ukraine. Given that Putin has ahistoryof ignoring agreements with Ukraine, Kyiv reasonably wants some assurance that the Russian military will not use a lull in the fighting to replenish itsdiminishedforces, rearm and reinvade. The best guarantee would be a European peacekeeping force on the ground, but European governments understandably seek a US backstop to deter Russian attack. Trump’s statedwillingnessto considerair supportfor a European force is an important step forward. The Russian government’s insistence on the power tovetoany security guarantees raises obvious questions about Putin’s intentions.For now, Putin seems to see advantage in continuing the war. To avoid angering Trump, he hasn’t outrightrefusedto meet with Zelenskyy but isslow-walkingthe matter by insisting on time-consuming prior steps. Given that Putin’s quest to undermine Ukraine’s democracy stems from his calculation of what it takes to retain power, the only way to soften his maximalist demands is by making his recalcitrance even more politically costly.This is where Trump has a role to play. Entering the Alaska summit, Trump had threatened “severe consequences” if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire. The mercurial Trump then seemingly abandoned that threat after a few hours with Putin.Trump could take various steps that would force Putin to recalibrate the rationale for his war. Trump could increase the supply ofarmsto Ukraine. He could further usetariffsto deter the sale of oil and gas that prop up the Russian military. He could press European governments to devote to Ukraine’s defense and rebuilding the$300bnof sovereign Russian assets that are now frozen in western accounts.It is deeply disturbing that matters of war and peace, democracy and autocracy,dependon stroking and flattering the fragile ego of the self-absorbed Trump. But that is the world we live in.European leaders have an essential role to play in nudging him in the right direction. They must get Trump to overcome his usual disdain for democratic rule, and admiration for autocrats like Putin, to acknowledge the centrality of defending Ukraine’s democracy for any fair resolution of the Ukraine conflict.These are counterintuitive steps for the American president. But if he wants to orchestrate an end to the horrible slaughter in Ukraine, he will have to summon the vision to take them.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

Will that save the monarchy?Simon JenkinsBy eschewing living in Buckingham Palace and suggesting ‘the firm’ be heavily scaled back, the prince has a survival plan that might workThu 21 Aug 2025 11.22 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 14.05 EDTShareThis was a good week to bury bad news. But why bury good news? No banner headline announced that the Prince of Wales is tomove house. He is to go from Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Home Park to the nearby Forest Lodge.That was not the real news. “Sources” said the switch was the outcome of Prince William’s “brutal” past year, in which both his wife and his father, King Charles, received treatment for cancer. This had led him to ponder the future of the monarchy, no less. He means to “reshape the institution he will lead … to be fit for purpose in the modern era”.The move to what William intends to be his family’s forever home is apparently symbolic of that reshaping. Above all, it is goodbye,Buckingham Palace. Charles’s current refusal to move his residence there from Clarence House is to be permanent.William’s eight-bedroom Forest Lodge is actually smaller than the couple’s country retreat of Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate. It has a handsome interior but,valued at £16m, it is no grander than an average Kensington mansion. More to the point, the house is to be exceptionally private, within and without. The royal family will reportedly have no live-in staff. William apparently wants to be a normal father who, even as king, wants to be seen on the school run.This is the most drastic move out of town by a British monarch since the Hanoverians deserted St James’s for Kew. William could have moved to his grandmother’s palace in Windsor Castle. He chose not to. He will also have his dissolute uncle, Prince Andrew, occupying the much larger 31-room mansion at Royal Lodge just down the road. He is clearly determined to join the modest ranks of the “bicycling monarchs” of Scandinavia and the Low Countries.In years past, there were intimations that the present king wanted to slim down the paraphernalia of monarchy. We have seen few examples of it in practice. Thecoronation ceremonywas still out of the dark ages. Nonsenses such as the king’s speech, the changing of the guard andMaundy moneystumble on. William had to dress up andspend a day at Royal Ascot, which he is said to hate. But there is a sense that Charles and Camilla are happy to conclude the Elizabethan age rather than initiate a new Carolean one.View image in fullscreenThe Belgian royal family cycling in Genk, June 2000 (left to right): Crown Princess Elisabeth, Queen Mathilde, Prince Gabriel, Princess Eléonore, King Philippe and Prince Emmanuel.Photograph: Dirk Waem/EPAAll the more reason to welcome a significant move by William. He wants to strip Britain’s monarchy of what thepeerless commentator Walter Bagehotcalled its “mystical and theatrical” dignities. A hereditary head of state has legitimacy only insofar as the state grants its consent. For that to be the case nowadays, he or she should seem as normal and uncontroversial as seems fitting. A majority of Britonsstill supporttheir monarchy, though only about one-third of under-25s.A bicycling monarchy is what it says. It implies an ordinary person doing an extraordinary job as the personification of a nation, not one anointed “by God” after undressing in a church cubicle. Dutch monarchs havecycledsince the 19th century.The Dutch king used to bea part-time airline pilot. These royal families are not turned into tortured celebrities as press officers seek headlines about their “making a difference”.The heir to Britain’s throne might have been perfectly cast for the job, given the possible alternatives. But the future lies ahead. One thing emphatically not yet sorted is the royal estate. This rambling arrangement of ancient buildings, storerooms and cobwebbed attics is a relic of the British empire left to gather dust. What does William intend to do with Buckingham Palace, St James’s Palace, Kensington Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham and Balmoral, not to mention his father’s Clarence House and Highgrove? If France, Austria and Spain can forget their empires and set their palaces free, Britain can surely do likewise. Versailles, Hofburg andEl Escorialno longer shelter royal uncles, aunts and cousins.Can a nation in crisis rely on the baby boomer generation to step up? I think the UK is about to find out | Phillip InmanRead moreIndeed, if the monarch is to be content with a hideaway in Windsor Park, his family had better watch out. The most his son George might expect is a two-bedroom semi in Clapham. As for Charlotte and Louis, what chance of a cosy bedsit in Stoke Newington? They would probably be happier that way.The clear answer is to treat these palaces as some are treated now, opened to the public as museums of royalty in the care of the Historic Royal Palaces agency. The real excitement should be Buckingham Palace and its gardens. The house would be a fine museum and art gallery of monarchy. But what of its gardens?Every royal park in London was donated to the public at some point in history by a monarch. Charles I gave us Hyde Park and Charles II St James’s. Regent’s Park was opened under William IV and Kensington Gardens under Queen Victoria. The Windsors have as yet given nothing.Buckingham Palace has the largest private garden in London. Its 16 hectares (39 acres) lie unused and unappreciated in the heart of town. Tearing down its walls and merging it with Green Park has often been mooted, but for obvious reasons never dared.Such a gift to London would be unequalled in Europe. It would also be a symbol of monarchical descent to normality. The gardens would complete a vale of greenery stretching across west London from Westminster to Notting Hill. They could be filled with bicycling monarchs.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After a hastily organised funeral where I delivered a eulogy too long for the warm afternoon, he was cremated. My brother collected his ashes and his favourite T-shirt.But his cheese lives on. Still in its torn packet, with one of Dad’s trademark purple elastic bands keeping it sealed, it has evolved into something other than food, and I refuse to imagine the meal when I finish it. My logic being that if it exists then so, somehow, does my dad.I had barely arrived in Japan when a police officer phoned to tell me that he’d died.Before ringing, officers had turned up at my flat, then at my brother’s house, to break the news gently. My children and I had just left a Buddhist temple dusted with snow, and they were busily negotiating our next destination.One wanted to visitKyoto marketfor lunch. And the other more op shops to hunt for more sneakers. Neither of them seemed to be winning and they looked to me to cast the deciding vote. Walking from the gift shop through the imposing temple gates, I played mediator, ignoring the phone ringing in my pocket.But it kept ringing. Over and over until I pulled it out and, when I saw that it said no caller ID, I answered it. The man said his name quickly. All I remember now is the Tom part and that he was phoning from St Kilda police station.It was the location that gave it away. Dad lived down the road. I knew instantly what the call meant. I started sinking, knees buckling, until my son, 16 and almost grown, scooped me up so I didn’t hit the ground.As a child I showed little interest in my mum’s sewing skills. After she died, I realised what I’d missed out on | Nova WeetmanRead moreTom didn’t need to finish the sentence for me to understand. As he tried to explain what had happened, I began wailing and couldn’t make any sense of it. My children crowded me and I realised, horrified, that they didn’t know what had been said. And then I understood that I’d have to tell them. I’d have to tell everyone.I whispered to them both,Boppa’s dead,using the name my daughter gave him all those years ago. They joined in the sobbing and we inched towards a park bench, huddled in a hug, as I listened for instructions.I had to find someone who would wait with Dad’s body until the undertaker arrived.Tom told me to take his numberjust in caseand I wrote it out on the only paper I could find.Unpacking days later in Melbourne, I found it scrawled on the back of the incense box I’d bought in the temple gift shop, when Dad was still alive in my world.That night, after we took the train back to Osaka, I drank whisky in sharp little gulps until everything numbed, and walked the winter streets looking for food and a tattoo parlour where I could cover my skin with something that hurt. Fortunately, we didn’t find one, and instead filled our pockets with chocolate and chips from a 7-Eleven.Two days later we flew home.When we arrived in Melbourne, the phone rang endlessly, flowers appeared, meals were delivered and my brother and I shuffled through the days, unsure how to operate now there were no parents left. It was the third funeral I had organised in 12 years. The third eulogy I delivered. The third time grief sucked me under and spat me out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Tackling the kitchen first, I opened the fridge. The same fridge that had served our family of four for all those years.With Dad living alone, it was under-utilised, so emptying it didn’t take long. I binned the wilting carrots, the greying cabbage, the milk edging past its use-by date, the medicines that should have been tossed long ago and a jar of pickles I recognised as one I’d given him. There were soy sauce fish from a takeaway meal and two square packets of wasabi no longer bright chemical green. On its own shelf was the half block of cheddar.I called out to my brother to ask if he minded if I took it, saying it would save me buying some. He wandered out from whichever room he was lost in and shrugged.Take it,he said.Depending on how many toasties we make, the block might do us for another month or so. And then it’ll be gone.

It could shape the future, for good or illThu 21 Aug 2025 10.46 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareRemember Jacob Rees-Mogg, Brexit opportunities and government efficiency minister, lurking round Whitehall offices to leavesarcastic printed cardson any empty desk: “Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. With every good wish”? The following year his government ordered the entire civil service to attend the office a minimum of 60% of the time. That has led to strikes and disputes over hybrid working, including at the Land Registry, among Metropolitan police civilians and at the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Covid taught many lessons: one of the best was discovering that people can work flexibly, need not waste time and money commuting, and can take jobs far from home while employers recruit the best from anywhere.The ONS is in so much trouble, from top to toe, you might think it would hasten to resolve this morale-lowering dispute, which appears symptomatic of what went wrong with its recently departed leadership. This week it hit yet more trouble,delaying crucial retail sales figuresto carry out further data “quality assurance”.Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) members havevoted yet againto continue their 18-month-old dispute with the ONS: 68% voted for strike action on a 71% turnout. It’s been an oddly quiet dispute: staff went on working their usual hybrid patterns, for their usual pay. But ONS bosses feel obliged to follow the 2023 civil service edict to dragoon staff into the office. This time staff are taking zero-attendance action.“What impact has hybrid working had on the ONS?” I asked the ONS spokesperson: the nation’s statisticians should have the best grasp on any research. Being an honest outfit, the press officer said: “We don’t know … We suspect there might be a bad impact, especially on younger staff, but it’s hard to quantify.” He said there was flexibility, and department leaders made special arrangements for some. Indeed, I spoke to one half of a couple working for the ONS, who were mystified as to why one of them could work from home while the other had to attend five days a week.The PCS general secretary, Fran Heathcote,argued last yearthat “applying arbitrary targets on office attendance doesn’t increase productivity and is unpopular with staff”. She said that if the government “want a motivated, hard-working workforce, ministers should trust their own employees to have some say over their working conditions”. The employees are mostly data analysts, many not only with maths or science bachelor degrees, but masters too: I spoke to one among many with PhDs. They are hard to recruit and harder to retain: other government departments pay more and the private sector a lot more. That makes flexibility and good treatment especially valuable. Autonomy and flexibility are so highly prized that research from the global expert Nick Bloom, a British professor of economics at Stanford University, suggests that people value it as much as an 8% pay increase, making themhappier and more productivewhen working partly from home. Women are farmore likely to quitif forced back to full-time office working: compelling a daily commute narrows their choices and widens the pay gap.This is a dilemma mostly of the higher-paid. About 60% of the workforce arefully at their place of work: you can’t serve in a shop, teach, nurse, care, cook, keep the sewers and electricity flowing or build from home. From scaffolders to surgeons, many have no choice, but the office-based are more likely to be graduates. WFH has settled into an average ofa quarter of all working days, a revolutionary five-fold increase on pre-Covid figures. At first sight, Nigel Farageseems again to miss the popular heartbeatwhen he pledges “no more working from home” in the 10 councils his party controls.It was enjoyably typical that his party was caught out advertising nine organising jobs as “home working with occasional travel”. But he does catch that macho management spirit, anti-civil service, anti-office workers, anti-graduates by implication. It’s a class gesture. It chimes with the Trump-Musk assault echoed among the titans: JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock, Amazon and UPS re-imposed five days in the office. Google’s co-founder Sergey Brinsent a memoclaiming, “60 hours is the sweet spot of productivity”. Like most posturing, this suggests insecurity and incapacity among managers: if they can’t see hands on keyboards, how do they know work is done?Some employers need to catch up with Angela Rayner’s radical shift in power towards the workforce, arriving soon with heremployment rights bill. Employers will need to give good reasons for refusing what the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) predicts will be more than a third asking forflexible and hybrid working. For those rooted to their workplace, they suggest alternatives such as compressed working in four-day weeks. Many employers do get the message: 41% tell a CIPD survey that increased home/hybrid working has led to increased productivity/efficiency; only 16% say the opposite.In a country where the best jobs are concentrated in London and the south-east, where housing is beyond the reach of most, hybrid working opens the door to the most competitive roles without the associated housing and commuting costs, letting employers choose from far afield. Flexibility has to work both ways – but most people want good contact with their offices. Sadly I hear of young people with London jobs wanting to work more from their office but unable to afford the commute.The ONS could lead the way out of this Rees-Mogg nonsense. Its confession that neither itsemployment figuresnor itswealth statisticsare reliable enough to use follows a devastating inquiry by the Commons public administration committee whose chair described agrossly dysfunctional hierarchywhere the chief statistician behaved like a “hybrid of a Medici prince and Blofeld” in a “boosterish chumocracy”, while theONS itself reportedpoor communication between the leadership and junior staff.Earlier this month the ONS acquired a new permanent secretary, with a chance to blow away old management and civil service attitudes. The PCS is optimistic. Abandoning needless presenteesism, the ONS might win back prizes it used to earn as a “best place to work”.All this is a destructive and pointless tug of war over power. Managers may prefer to see people at desks, but for many who take jobs while carefully calculating rents, house prices, commuting costs and childcare complexities, flexibility is not a nice-to-have feature but the difference between taking and leaving a job. It matters far more to the staff than to the Rees-Mogg/Faragist macho management poseurs.

Something practical, sustainable and affordable shouldn’t be too much to askThu 21 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 10.41 EDTShareSomething big is about to happen to households acrossEngland. Exhausted parents at the playground, wild-eyed as they respond to work emails while their kids charge past with anarchic abandon, gather their final ounces of energy. “Liberation day is coming,” they whisper. Finally, after six weeks of summer holidays, the kids are going back to school.But my own heady excitement at regaining some semblance of routine come September has been derailed by an adjacent exercise: procuring my daughter’s first school uniform. Call me curmudgeonly, but there’s few things I resent more than spending more than £300 to dress my four-year-old in a suit and tie.The British obsession with forcing children into business attire from an age when they can’t yet read or write is surely a form of national delirium. School uniform undoubtedly has worthy roots. It has prevailed in most schools since the 19th century, when it was introduced as a means to reduce the appearance of socioeconomic disparities and create a sense of community and cohesion. But can we say with any conviction that uniforms in their current tradition still do that?So extortionate they have become that someparents in England are skipping mealsand turning to buy now, pay later services such as Klarna to afford them before the autumn term, according to a survey by the parenting charity Parentkind.At the small, south London state primary my daughter attends, the blazer alone costs £38. The branded cardigan, made of 50% acrylic, is £23. These, alongside the other compulsory items on the school’s list, must be bought from one specialist uniform supplier. Delivery is another £8. Ordered the wrong size? That’s a shame – returns are at your expense, unless you would rather go to the physical store, a mere 45 minutes and two train rides away in the neighbouring borough of Croydon. The school’s secondhand uniform shop thrives but is a victim of its own success – only the most organised can snap up the available stock in the required sizes before it sells out before the summer term is even over. It’s almost like the whole process has been designed to ramp up your blood pressure by 10 points.Government messaging says schools should make uniforms affordable and work with families who struggle to afford them. But there is no benchmark to say how they should be priced, nor any set rules that schools have to abide by. Indeed, some schools ask for as many as 10 branded items, pushing the cost of a child’s uniform with PE kitup to £400. The government recognises the problem – it has plans to limit branded student kit to three articles, plus a tie, from September 2026 in England, and the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has urged schools to bring in reasonable measures beforehand. “You don’t need a posh blazer to learn your times tables, and Shakespeare is just as inspiring in a supermarket sweater,” shewrote on X. I couldn’t agree more – especially when said blazer will probably be lost in the first week of term.Friends tell me they uphold a quiet form of resistance. One says that after her five-year-old lost his blazer twice in a row, she simply refused to replace it until the following year and ignored the headteacher’s protests. But in other parts of the country, it has become commonplace to hear stories of children being excluded for not wearing the correct uniform. I can’t help but wonder if these incidents could have been avoided if schools simply had more accommodating rules. And of course,enforcing dress codesfalls to our notoriously time-rich teachers – as if teaching in 2025 doesn’t already give them enough to contend with.There is an argument that uniforms help to drive up standards, that being smartly dressed encourages a level of engagement with education. Or, for schools in big cities struggling to attract pupils, maybe it’s a way for them to stand out – a form of advertising their high standards. Private school-inspired uniform must appeal to some socially ambitious parents. But research on the impact of uniforms is mixed. “There is little robust evidence that introducing a school uniform will, by itself, improve academic performance, behaviour, or attendance,” says theEducation Endowment Foundation. And however much uniforms have been modernised, they remain heavily gendered.New researchfrom the University of Cambridge found school uniform policies could even be restricting young people from being active, particularly primary school-age girls.Anecdotal evidencesuggests most uniforms are made from synthetic materials, chock full of forever chemicals that are breathed in when our children get hot. As our climate becomes more unpredictable and our school buildings suddenly feel woefully unfit to cope with the changing temperatures, it feels more important than ever that our children are dressed comfortably and that the fabrics they wear are not just breathable but also sustainable.Despite my protests, I’m not arguing for uniform to be abolished. Who could dislike its practicality on already chaotic school mornings? And I think they do achieve something unquantifiable in fostering a sense of community and cohesion. But here is my plea for reason: make them affordable, sustainable, and while we’re here make them easy to get hold of, replace and clean.At the heart of this issue is an existential question: what is school for? For children to develop and learn? Or to mould them in a one-dimensional way? Today we accept that success and achievement can look many different ways. And it doesn’t always come dressed in a suit and tie.Lucy Pasha-Robinson is an assistant editor on Guardian OpinionExplore more on these topicsSchoolsOpinionParents and parentingSchool brandingEducation policyChildrenEnglandFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

We’re scroungers, rapists,fighting-age menwho shouldn’t have left our home countries. Sometimes we’re simply “illegals”, the most dehumanising term of all. When did it become a crime to run for your life?The people levelling these accusations are superb at making themselves heard. Mud sticks – and most of us are too scared to try to set the record straight. I don’t know how many of our accusers have sat down with us, human to human, and listened to our stories. Here’s mine.I grew up in Syria. My childhood was safe and happy – idyllic when I look back at it. In 2011, theArab springand civil war in Syria changed everything. I was imprisoned twice for protesting against theAssad regime,but it never crossed my mind to leave. Like many young people, I never thought death would come for me.Everything changed when I was almost killed in a deadly missile attack in a suburb of Aleppo I was only 17, and I realised that I wanted to live. So I escaped. First to Turkey, and then I travelled through Europe until I reached Calais. I hoped to reach the UK for two reasons. First, my auntie and cousins live here. After my mum died when I was 14, my auntie became a second mum to me. Second, I could speak English. The thing people don’t understand about refugees is how tired we are from what we have been through. All I could think about was resting and being with my auntie.I spent 10 months in Calais trying to get to Britain. It was before small boat crossings become the main method of getting here, but the smugglers were there. We all hated them because they made it more difficult for us to cross the Channel without them. I tried every way I could: lorries, cargo trains, sneaking into the port to try to conceal myself on a ferry.At that time the French police wereattacking migrants, as they do now. Sometimes they would be helpful and tell us things such as what time border guards changed shift – that was the best time to try to sneak on to a train or a lorry. Sometimes we were wished good luck by French and British border force and police; some saw us as humans, some saw us as criminals.When I made it to the UK in 2017, I thought I had finally found safety, but my experience with the Home Office reminded me that I hadn’t. I always felt as if I was being treated like a criminal. I was required to report to a police station regularly, and it took more than two years to get a decision on my asylum case.Government aside, in that period British society was generally more welcoming towards people such as me. I could walk down the street in one of the UK’s diverse cities and blend in. I met wonderful people who always made me feel as if I belonged.Everything changed when the previous government introduced the now-cancelled Rwanda scheme. People wereput in detention centresand threatened with deportation. Although I had been granted leave to remain by then, I was really scared that the government would come after me too and deport me. That fear has grown even more since the Home Office changed its policy this February: people like me who entered irregularly will now “normally be refused citizenship”. One of the nightmares I often have is of shouting for help in the middle of the street when no one can hear me. I now feel I am living that dream.Now that I havelived in the UKfor a few years, I understand the politics better. People just want someone to blame for the state of the economy and public services – and migrants and refugees are the easiest to blame. Some believe the lies about us. I work as a cinematographer and also volunteer with a charity as an Arabic interpreter. I speak to a lot of age-disputed young people who the Home Office insists are adults and have been placed in adult hotels. It is so obvious when I listen to them speak that they are children. They cry down the phone to me. They hate being in hotels, forced to share rooms with adults they don’t know.Most refugees dream of returning home if it becomes safe to do so. I often think back to the secure time of my childhood. I grew up with the scents of jasmine and geranium in my garden. I have planted those things here to try to recreate a sense of home. No matter what I do here to contribute, I feel I will always be viewed as a criminal and someone at risk of being sent back to my country, however unsafe it is.Open, explicit racism seems to be on the rise in Britain. It starts with refugees like me and other migrants – but they will soon come for other people simply because they are not white, or belong to the “wrong” religion, or their sexual orientation. Unless we act now, things are going to get worse.As told to Diane TaylorAyman Alhussein is a Syrian film-maker based in LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I think the UK is about to find outPhillip InmanA raid on property wealth and pensions is being signalled by the Treasury, and it has sound reasons for doing just thatThu 21 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 04.03 EDTShareDear baby boomer, the government is coming for you and your store of wealth. The property and pensions built up over the past 40 to 50 years are, for the first time, in play. The triple lock on the state pension might be guaranteed, at least for the time being, but for the wealthier boomer, it looks like their private assets are being laid out on a chopping board, ready to be carved like a Sunday roast and fed to hungry government departments starved of funds for almost two decades.These are desperate times and taxing the wealthy is a desperate measure. No government wants to do it. If you tax the rich, they might fly away in their private jets.That’s happened in Norway, one of the few European countries to retain a wealth tax. It’s true that older middle-income voters are more likely to stay put, but they also have a tendency to vote with their self-interest in mind. And because baby boomers are the most active age group on polling day – many of them among the richest in society – that has always spelled disaster for the party in government.There have been skirmishes in the past. This time it’s serious.Property wealth is thefocus of the latest leaksfrom the Treasury. And there is a good reason why when the housing market is gridlocked and needs to be more flexible. The Treasury is considering changes to the tax regime that will shift the burden of council tax and the centuries-old property transaction charge –stamp duty land tax(SDLT) – towards more expensive homes.One proposal is less about an increase in the total amount of money raised from SDLT for the exchequer than encouraging more transactions. The payback for a heavier tax on the sale of more expensive homes is a discount on the charge applied to cheaper ones. As the average worker discovers that moving house involves paying less tax, they will be more likely to take work in a different area, boosting labour mobility and economic growth. With more economic growth comes higher tax receipts. Bingo.It’s true there will probably be more transactions in the short term. Unfortunately for property buyers, the experience of David Cameron and George Osborne’s help to buy scheme is that tax incentives are absorbed into a new higher price and the only winner is the seller. There should be a question mark over the plan when ministers consider why many people stay put, rather than sell. And, in particular, why those who have retired cling to the family home well into their late 70s, 80s and 90s.The UK’s 12 million over-65s should be the focus of any property tax debate, because they occupy a disproportionate share of family homes. According to a study by the research charity the Intergenerational Foundation using official data, the average 65-year-old lives in a home offering more than 65 sq metres of space per person. By contrast, those aged 30 to 44 have less than 40 sq metres to move around in. Homes with three or more bedrooms are in short supply and hundreds of thousands of them are owned by older people who only use a fraction of the space, except maybe when family members gather at Christmas and Easter.Resistance to selling is strong. Older people will have emotional ties to a property they have owned for a long time. And they will often defy the urging of their family to downsize when they consider all the filling of forms and anxiety connected with it. Yet more than anything, studies have shown downsizing is stymied by a lack of suitable properties – ones that are smaller and yet have features that make them attractive to people moving from large homes.Flats in modern tower blocks designed for young professionals are often narrow and cramped, ill suited to a buyer who is considering a last-ever property, one that can cope with a wheelchair. We could blame councils that fail to take into account older people whenever they consider public housing. And the Ministry ofHousing, Communities and Local Government does not seem to have the subject on its radar. Older people’s housing is strictly of the sheltered variety and the preserve of private providers such as Axa and McCarthy Stone.But dear boomer, you must accept that your inaction has consequences. There is very little demand for the flats and small homes that might fit your whole-life needs. It appears that all you want is toretire early and cash out, taking your accidental winnings with you. Accidental because they were only accrued as a consequence of you being born at the right time, when by sheer force of numbers, your generation pushed property and share prices higher.Reeves considering tax on high-value homes to help plug hole in financesRead moreBoomers are the problem, but could also be the solution – and lessof a target. If boomersgave more of their time to local communitiesrather than jetting off on several holidays a year, and if they moved out of their main homes in good time in favour of younger families, there might be less reason to pursue their wealth.The government is in a financial fix because the wheels of the economy are turning slowly. That’s been the case since the financial crash. But it doesn’t have to be. If better-off retirees demanded smaller, appropriate housing, the private sector would begin to provide it, home sales would increase and the economy turn at a faster lick. Otherwise the UK, like so many rich, ageing countries, will be stuck.If boomers cannot bring themselves to act collectively and patriotically for the greater good, as seems unlikely for many reasons, then it will be legitimate for the government to pursue their lottery winnings with higher property and pension taxes. Still, dear boomer, it was a good ride while it lasted.Phillip Inman is senior economics writer for the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We have the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, which was established with petroleum revenues in 1990. Headed by the wealthy banker and art investor Nicolai Tangen, the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), has a currentvalue of more than 20 239bn Norwegian kroner(£1.4tr). With holdings in about 8,500 companies in 69 different countries, it is the largest single investor in the world.Norway also purports to have a human-rights-based foreign policy, and the sovereign wealth fund is supposed to adhere to a set of ethical guidelines. Companies may be excluded if there is a risk that they contribute to or are responsible for serious human rights violations, or are involvedin the sale of weapons to states that violate international law in armed conflicts. A Council on Ethics makesrecommendations about exclusionsfrom the GPFG’s investment portfolio, but only after the fact.Since 2024, the government hasrepeatedly cautionedNorwegian business not to invest in companies that support Israeli occupation policies or human rights violations. But it seems to have had few problems with the fact that the sovereign wealth fund hasinvestments totalling 22.7bn Norwegian kroner(£1.6bn) in 65 Israeli companies.Since the Hamas atrocities of 7 October 2023 and Israel’s subsequent retaliation in Gaza, the oil fund has actually increased its investments in Israel by 66%. These are managed bythree Israeli investment companies, one of which has clear links to Israeli cabinet ministers.In April this year, the UN’s special rapporteur Francesca Albanesewarnedthat Norway’s sovereign wealth fund had investments in Israeli arms companies and was a “major European source of investment for Israel’s ongoing occupation”. She warned of the risks of complicity with violations of international law. The Norwegian minister of finance, Jens Stoltenberg (a former Nato secretary general), rebuffed Albanese, but many Norwegian NGOs stepped up the pressure.In June, a 118-page reportfrom Historians for Palestine– based on research that could easily have been done by the oil fund’s ethics council – revealed Norwegian state investments in Israeli companies believed to be involved in the genocide in Gaza. The report was sent to the Ministry of Finance but gained little traction. Then, as Norwegians began taking their summer holidays,another news site documentedinvestments by the wealth fund in Israeli companies, including Bet Shemesh Engines, which provides maintenance and supplies parts for the Israeli air force’s F-15, F-16 and Apache helicopters, which have terrorised Gaza’s civilian population; and Next Vision Stabilized Systems, which produces cameras for drones used by the Israeli army in Gaza.A none too subtle clue about Bet Shemesh’s activities may be gathered from the company’s own website, which declares that it is “particularly proud to support IAF’s frontline fighter aircraft and helicopters”. At a time when the number of Palestinians killed by the IDF had already exceeded 20,000, and legal scholars increasingly began referring to Israel’s war on Gaza as a genocide, the GFPFincreased its sharesin Bet Shemesh, whose share market value had skyrocketed.Opposition parties on the left in Norway have long demanded that the oil fund’s investments in Israel should be pulled completely. But as recently as June, a parliamentary majorityvoted downthat proposal.One of the stock responses to critics of investing in Israeli companies is that there should not be any “political interference” with investment decisions. Yet four days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Ministry of Finance instructed that the GPFG divest from Russia.It was not until the liberal-conservative Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten this monthpublished the news of theGPFG’s investments in Bet Shemeshthat this turned into a full-blown political scandal. Stoltenberg at that point demanded a full review of the fund’s investments in Israeli companies.The government has now announced that the GPFG will divest from 17 Israeli companies, including Bet Shemesh Engines, and that the fund’s Israel investments will no longer be managed by Israeli investment companies. The prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, has howeverruled out the total divestmentfrom Israel that opposition parties on the left have called for.But mediadisclosuresabout the GPFG’s investments keep coming. The latest relate to fund stakes in two Israeli banks whose loans have played a key role in Elbit, Israel’s largest private arms manufacturer. Elbit was the first Israeli company the GPFGdivested from, in 2009, citing its involvement in violations of international law.“Nordic exceptionalism” comes naturally to Norwegians: we like to think of ourselves as a beacon in a dark world, leading the way inEuropeon ethics and virtue. Norway formally recognised the state of Palestine in 2024 (which the Israeli far-right government described as an act that rewarded terrorism). But the scandal over the sovereign wealth fund is testing both that self-image and the political consensus about our ethical and human-rights-based foreign policy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But with the country heading for a general election on 8 September, the issue of collectively profiting from investments in companies that supply the perpetrators of genocide in Gaza is converting a moral dilemma into a political turning point.Voters face a choice between a centre-left government committed to building national wealth via investments in Israel; a rightwing party (and the main opposition) that wants to ignore the ongoing genocide in Gaza and increase trade with Israel; and the leftwing calling for total divestment fromIsrael. So far, polls indicate that foreign policy is higher up the agenda for voters than ever before. If this is accurate, the governing Labour party may be severely punished for its stance. This could open the door to a government which would be even worse on the issue of Palestine.But if an ethical foreign policy means anything, then Gaza must be a defining issue forNorway, a mirror for Norwegians too.Sindre Bangstad is research professor at KIFO, Institute for Church, Religion and Worldview Research in OsloDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Every glossy announcement masks the same reality: cuts, closures and a hollowing-out of the very institutions meant to serve the public good.I am a lecturer in education at University of Technology Sydney. My colleagues are outstanding, the students dedicated. And yet, despite newly developed and accredited teacher education courses and courses that have been delivered for 35 years, our education programs are being“temporarily” suspended from autumn 2026.While the announcement avoids the term “closure”, in this sector that is what’s likely to follow. This means the suspension of secondary and primary education degrees, alongside teaching English to speakers of other languages (Tesol) and applied linguistics – the very programs designed to address teacher shortages.University of Melbourne breached students’ privacy by using wifi network to monitor pro-Palestine protestRead moreAnd the justification? “Low student enrolments.” But these numbers come from auditors looking at spreadsheets, not classrooms. Education and commerce students, for example, are coded separately, even though in practice they sit within the education or business cohorts for all of their subjects. On paper the numbers might look thin; in reality, the rooms are full.Once these programs are paused, they are almost impossible to bring back. Student intake stops, momentum is lost, expertise disperses, partnerships dissolve and whole areas of knowledge are lost. The consequences will be far-reaching. Schools and communities will be left without a trusted partner; aspiring teachers will lose access to high-quality, practice-based training. Nationally, we will lose vital research capacity – especially in the areas related to vulnerable and multilingual communities. What has taken decades to build can be dismantled in a single budget cycle.UTS is a public university with a legislated obligation to “meet the needs of the community”. Its charter clearly states that the university exists for the public good. If preparing teachers for New South Wales schools during an ongoing teacher shortage isn’t a public good, what is? The NSW Department of Education reports a daily shortfall of nearly one-third of its casual teachers. Primary and secondary teachers are the second and third-largest occupations in shortage, according to the Australian government’s 2024 Occupational Shortage List. And yet, one of Australia’s leading universities is suspending the very programs that feed this workforce. The burden of proof should be on the university to explain how cutting teacher education fulfils its mission.Beyond the numbers, it is worth remembering who these programs serve. For years UTS has been a pipeline for teachers equipped to work with refugee-background students, newly arrived migrants, learners from linguistically diverse communities, and “second chance” adult learners with basic literacy and numeracy needs. As an English as an additional language or dialect (EAL/D) teacher and researcher, I have seen the difference that skilled, culturally responsive teachers can make. Suspending these courses doesn’t just threaten teacher numbers – it threatens the right of some of our most vulnerable students to an equitable education.The social justice implications are profound. UTS is one of the preferred providers of EAL/D-trained and adult literacy and numeracy teachers to government and other schools, and adult education centres. In a state as multicultural as NSW – with more than a third of students from language backgrounds other than English – gutting these subjects is indefensible. Closing down or “suspending” programs like these doesn’t just affect UTS. It removes national capacity in areas core to access, equity and social cohesion, as well as economic productivity.Academic labels Julie Bishop ‘hostile and arrogant’ in tearful evidence to ANU inquiryRead moreOnce more it seems that teacher education is in the firing line. If the public is constantly told, “Teachers can’t read and write! They only need an Atar of 50!”, why would anyone sign up? If hardworking and dedicated teachers are told they’re “only in it for the holidays”, why would they stay? And now, a university is seemingly dismantling the courses that educate the teachers themselves. This is more than shortsighted – it’s self-sabotage. When we hollow out the teaching profession, we undermine our children’s future. When we strip away specialist programs like Tesol, adult literacy and numeracy and EAL/D, we deepen inequality, leaving the most vulnerable students further behind.Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. And the question is: what happens to the state of NSW when there are no teachers left to hold it up?Dr Isobel Crealy is an academic and educator with expertise in EAL/D and refugee educationExplore more on these topicsAustralian universitiesOpinionAustralian educationcommentShareReuse this content"

This would be done by introducing a separate schedule for passive incomes such as rent, interest and capital gains which could either have a flat rate or a simplified progressive structure, as we have with wages.You could still deduct losses from an investment property, for example, but only against other capital income, or carried forward to offset the tax paid when the asset is sold. Not against labour income.Fixing Australia’s broken environmental laws must be the first step in improving productivity | Ken HenryRead moreWhat are the benefits? How would it help Australia?It will make our tax system fairer and more sustainable, while encouraging people to invest in themselves and build their skills. It will also reduce the incentives to split or reclassify income – often through the use of trusts – to exploit lower tax rates.Australia’s current tax system applies progressive income tax rates to earnings from work – wages and salaries – but taxes other sources of income, including property, shares and superannuation, in a variety of ways.The idea of all income being pooled together sounds good in theory, but in practice, it means two people earning the same total income can pay vastly different amounts of tax depending on where that income comes from. This creates two problems. First, people on the same income can pay different amounts. Second, people on higher incomes can end up paying less tax than those earning less.What are the downsides?Some argue this would reduce the incentive to save. However, evidence shows tax rates have little impact on how much people save, but do influence where they put it. The current system favours some forms of saving over others.How practical is it?A dual income system is not a novel concept and has been used in several European countries since the 1990s. The proposal has broad support by tax experts, including the Australian National University’sTaxand Transfer Policy Institute.How politically risky is it? How could it be sold to the public?All tax reform is challenging.Rebalancing tax across income sources would allow Australians to smooth their total tax paid more evenly over their lifetime, instead of loading it most heavily when they have a good, well-paying job but also the most expenses: raising their kids, paying down student debt, and saving for or paying off a mortgage.Secondly, we have an ageing population and budget deficits underwritten by the implausible strategy that working Australians won’t notice us taxing them more and more each year (through bracket creep).Finally, and importantly, this isn’t about redistributing wealth from one generation to another or punishing those who have been savvy with their money. It’s about preserving the overall progressivity of the system that all Australians expect while also encouraging people to invest in themselves.Allegra Spender is the independent member for WentworthExplore more on these topicsTaxOne Big IdeaAustralian politicsAustralian economyAllegra SpenderIndependentscommentShareReuse this content"

After unsheathing the blade, she pokes it into her stomach, then makes a slitting motion across her throat. Although these may seem like the ritual actions of a priestess, Saeidi is actually performing on stage at Bristol festival ArcTanGent last weekend, singing with her metal outfit Lowen in a crammed tent.“It’s a Turkish Ottoman dagger,” she tells me backstage later that day. “I got it in some very cool, obscure-looking vintage shop in Turkey last year. I’m really interested in historical items from that region – but, because I can’t go toIran, I have to gather things from around the Silk Road and places like that.”Saeidi is a Briton of Iranian descent, her parents having fled their home country to seek asylum following the 1979 revolution. She was born in exile and does things every day that would break the law in Iran. It is forbidden for women to sing by themselves in public; in 2015, members of thrashmetal band Confesswere arrested for blasphemy and propaganda against the state simply because they made anti-establishment music. In the 1980s, the Iranian government kept Saeidi’s aunt in prison for nine years and tortured her due to her socialist activism, before she too escaped to the UK.“She has horrific PTSD,” the singer says. “She’s basically my second mum. She raised me and she would take me to protests. I kind of got my political acumen from her.”Through Lowen – a twist on the word “lion”, as the band believe the animal symbolises power in eastern and western cultures – Saeidi expresses her passion for Iranian history and her disdain for the country’s authoritarian regime. On last year’s debut album Do Not Go to War With the Demons of Mazandaran (named after a chapter from the epic Persian poem the Shahnameh), she sings in English, Farsi and extinct languages such as Sumerian. She also uses the tahrir vocal technique, a wobbling wail distinct to Iranian classical music.The first line of the song Najang Bah Divhayeh Mazandaran is “Let this be the death of silence”, announcing the band’s defiant intent. The title ofCorruption on Earthcomes from the charge Iran givespolitical prisonersbefore executing them, and its lyrics address the Woman, Life, Freedom movement:nationwide demonstrationsthat followed the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was allegedly tortured for not adhering to Iran’s strict clothing laws for women. From the movement’s beginnings in late 2022 through to September 2023, Iranian authorities killed at least 551 protesters.“I feel guilt for not being there,” Saeidi says when I mention the protests. “I’m in such a privileged position that I can make music here. If I were in Iran, I’d be happy that I’d be with my family, that I’d be able to explore the country, but I would not have the freedoms that I have.”Since releasing the album last October, Lowen’s powerful themes and labyrinthine sound have made them one of the UK’s hottest metal acts.MetalHammer put Do Not Go to War … in its top 10 albums of 2024; the band have toured with former Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde; and this summer, as well as ArcTanGent, they played at Download festival.View image in fullscreenLowen, left to right: Cal Constantine, Nina Saeidi, Shem Lucas.Photograph: Andy FordBut the genre in which Saeidi is a rising star was banned at home when she was young. “My dad was quite tyrannical,” she remembers. “A lot of people assume it’s because of religion, but he just didn’t like noise. If I turned a page too loudly in my book at night, he would come in and scream at me.”Classic rock and Middle Eastern folk were permitted when Saeidi’s father wasn’t around. Eventually, in an act of protest, she picked up an issue of Kerrang! and bought albums by the two bands that stood out most: Armenian American four-piece System of a Down and UK black/death metal provocateurs Akercocke.“Both became my favourite band,” she says. “Akercocke are extremely sexual but kind of empowering, in my opinion, for women. As a teenager growing up in an extremely Middle Eastern household, that was crazy shocking – if someone was kissing on TV, the channel would get changed.”Saeidi met guitarist Shem Lucas at an Akercocke show in London, and they co-founded Lowen in 2017. The band will play their biggest headline concert to date at Camden’s Underworld in December, and they’re in the middle of writing their second album, which will reference Israel’s bombing of Iran in June.View image in fullscreenLowen performing at ArcTanGent festival.Photograph: Carl Battams“Our new music contains samples of those bombings,” Saeidi reveals. “I do not agree with anything that Israel has done. It’s bad to bomb Iran. None of those governments are good – neither is ours. We need to start separating criticism of a government from criticism of a people or an ethnicity or a religion, because it’s not the same thing.”However, Saeidi doesn’t want Lowen’s music to be a call to action, hoping instead to create a communal space for listeners. “People need to spend more time with each other,” she believes, arguing that third spaces – those outside work and home – “are being cut away, and I think that is causing so much division. Through division, people are getting away with murder, essentially – with genocide.”Do Not Go to War With the Demons of Mazandaranis out now on Church Road.

For the historical fiction stork has descended from on high with another bundle of monarchical joy. King and Conqueror (BBC) – a hugely entertaining depiction of the events that led to the Battle of Hastings – is the latest addition to that most stately of small-screen genres: the royal drama.Heavy is the head that wears the crown, though! For the portrayal of any British royal – and here we have Harold II (James Norton) and Edward the Confessor (Eddie Marsan) – is subject to a set of unspoken rules, most of which apply to the circumference of the royal nostrils and vowels, all of which must expand to fill the space available and, where necessary, beyond.But which small-screen portrayals of British sovereigns deserve veneration? And which deserve banishment to the Tower? God save this lot (or not, as the case may be):ThebestClaire Foy as Elizabeth II inThe Crown(2016-2019)View image in fullscreenCrowning glory … Claire Foy in The Crown.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/NetflixFoy’s multi-award winning performance offered an exquisitely nuanced take on the rise of HRH, from tremulous young newlywed, gasping as centuries of tradition prepare to clamp her in a constitutional headlock, to unflappable monarch, her tiny, gloved hand steady on the nation’s rudder. Even as the queenly baton was passed on – first to Olivia Colman, then Imelda Staunton – it was Foy’s quiet, beautifully controlled study that remained The Crown’s crowning glory: the definitive portrayal of, if you will, The Ascent of Ma’am.Damian Lewis as Henry VIII in Wolf Hall (2015 & 2024)View image in fullscreenA bearded love-tank … Damian Lewis in Wolf Hall.Photograph: Nick Briggs/BBC/Playground EntertainmentOh look, it’s brilliant Damian Lewis being brilliant again, whether barrelling around Hampton Court Palace like a bearded love-tank or smirking inscrutably at poor, doomed Thomas Cromwell (Mark Rylance) as his principles, perspicacity and waistline gradually melt into a gouty moral abyss. A complex portrait of the isolation and boredom of autocracy, this was a performance as muscular and layered as a Tudor turducken.Eddie Marsan as Edward the Confessor in King and Conqueror (2025)View image in fullscreenA pious mole … Eddie Marsan in King and Conqueror.Photograph: BBC/CBS Studios“Do you hear it?” he whispers, palms upturned and huge face raised beatifically to the rafters. And we do: it is the sound of heaven’s own brass section, heralding a performance of such exquisite, mesmerising strangeness, “one” is compelled to speak in terms of career bests while pointing solemnly at a vast neon sign that reads, simply, “Bafta”. Thus, we are blessed with scenes in which Marsan’s squat, oleaginous Edward chatters to “the saints”, wangs on about God, muffs kingly addresses, looks to mummy (a magnificently vicious Harriet Walter) for reassurance and generally poddles around like a pious 11th-century mole. Send him victorious!Miranda Richardson as Elizabeth I in Blackadder II (1986)View image in fullscreenQueenie, a great royal monster … Miranda Richardson in Blackadder II.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy“But surely the televisual depiction of royalty is no place for merriment,” you (a fool) cry. “It is a palace of solemnity, of august vowels and clenched patrician buttocks, by jove!” You are wrong. For here is one of TV’s greatest royal monsters; wrinkling her tiny nosy-wose at the faintest hint of dissent and greeting everything from practical jokes to executions with the same squealing, dazed wonderment; like a cartoon toddler that has been whacked over the head with a 16th-century frying pan and, inexplicably, quite liked it.Jared Harris as George VI in The Crown (2016-2017)View image in fullscreenExtraordinary charisma and porridge-y jowls … Jared Harris in The Crown.Photograph: Alex Bailey/NetflixIt’s a testament to Harris’ extraordinary charisma that the actor was able to turn a role consisting almost solely of the direction “Int: Coughing” into one of the most touching and memorable of all small-screen monarchic portrayals. So here he is, peering rheumily out of a series of royal windows, porridge-y jowls wobbling with the combined burden of … [clears throat] … duty to his country … and [cough] … bloody Churchill. Not to mention his deep concern for his beloved, callow Elizabeth as he faces up to his own, tumour-hastened [Bafta-nominated splutter ] mortality.TheworstJonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII in The Tudors (2007-2010)View image in fullscreenIntense buttock work … Jonathan Rhys Meyers in The Tudors.Photograph: Bbc/Sportsphoto/AllstarHe’s Henry the Eighth, he is. Alas, he is also Jonathan Rhys Meyers, a situation that would ultimately prove as devastating to the Tudor “brand” as dysentery. The means? Flagrant Irishness. Plus? Distressingly intense buttock work. See also: eyebrows, extended bouts of pouting, shouting “gnyaaaarr” in order to indicate vexation/gout and repeatedly smushing his chin into his chest while flaring his nostrils, like a horse that’s just been refused a divorce by Pope Clement VII.Carolyn Sadowska as Elizabeth II in The Women of Windsor (1992)View image in fullscreenA concussed wig on castors … Carolyn Sadowska in The Women of Windsor.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA Canadian (heavy sigh) TV movie, here, that nudges its snout into the private lives of Lady Diana Spencer (depicted as a sobbing bouffant) and Sarah Ferguson (a horse shouting at a helicopter through a fence). Shonkiest of its uniformly risible performances/impersonations, however, is Sadowska’s The Queen, who glides through her bits like a concussed wig on castors. Highlights: staring expressionlessly at cutlery, mechanically stirring a visibly empty teacup and not moving her lips while speaking, thus ensuring her vowels remain locked in terminal combat (“So you’re fond of horses, Diaaannaaaeuuugh?”).David Threlfall as Prince Charles in Diana: Her True Story (1993)View image in fullscreenWincing in tweed … David Threlfall in Diana: Her True Story.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyIt was a dark day for drama and, indeed, logic, when the great David “Shameless” Threlfall agreed to participate in this rush-released adaptation of Andrew Morton’s bestselling biography. Nevertheless, here, for reasons best known to himself, he is; wincing in tweed, biting his lip and saying “ngggnn” in a window-rattling potboiler that recasts the House of Windsor as [needle scratch, crash zoom on startled corgi] the House of Gits. Cue much cufflink-twiddling and a persistent, pained grimace that is less “future King of England” and more “Aardman character with gingivitis”.Max Irons as Edward IV in The White Queen (2013)View image in fullscreenAmbulant sex-piñata … Max Irons in The White Queen.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyForsooth, sirrah, with thy idle pouting and thy smouldering toplessness thou dost surely turn the Wars of the Roses into the “Wars of the Poses!” And lo, much vexation does ensue as Max “Son of Jeremy” Irons plays the 15th-century ruler in the manner of an ambulant sex-piñata, with protracted brooding sessions punctuated by the sort of explosive heritage boffing scenes in which there is clearly at least half a metre separating boffer and boffee’s woohoos. Highlights? No. Although there is a bit where he narrows his eyes and purrs, “I’m brave”. Which is something.Jane Alexander as Elizabeth II in William & Catherine: A Royal Romance (2011)View image in fullscreenPeppy action ma’am … Jane Alexander in William & Catherine: A Royal Romance.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyBow ties spin in horror as the House of Windsor is reimagined as Chessington World of Sovereigns™ in a Hallmark TV movie of such thoroughgoing stupidity it seems unfair to point the sceptre of shame at a single, poorly wigged element. Still, needs must. So here is the otherwise excellent (and, indeed, Emmy-nominated for her recent guest role in Severance) Jane Alexander slumming it as QEII; a maddeningly peppy action-ma’am whose determination to “embrace this new world!” is conveyed via scenes in which she plays Wii Sports, nods along to hip-hop and says “Kanye West” in an accent that could skin a corgi.King & Conqueror is on BBC One from 24 AugustExplore more on these topicsTelevisionThe CrownHistorical drama (TV)Period drama (TV)DramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was a little scared as well – we were this new band, putting ourselves out there. The label sent us physical copies of Adrenaline when it came out – I think we even got cassettes back then. It was so exciting to open it up and have something tangible to hold. But we had no sense of the longevity it would enjoy. I didn’t anticipate people would still be listening to it, or even that we’d still be a band this many years later. We still have nerves, obviously, whenever we release something. But we also have a sense of confidence, especiallywith this new record.Do you find your creativity burns brightest in hardship?Or can peace be just as potent?sheneadThere’s something to be said for both, and our music has that dichotomy built into its DNA – a lot of our songs have that yin and yang within them. There’s a lot more peace than chaos in our lives at the moment, and I’m happy it’s that way. A lot of our earlier records were made when life was more crazy, and we were able to capture that. But with this record, there’s some of that beauty that comes with this invigorated time we’re living in now. But it’s always good to be able to yell and scream sometimes, right? The pandemic was really difficult for everybody, but as someone who was spoilt by having this outlet my whole adult life, to be able to tour and play shows and express myself … I really came to a dead stop during Covid. It really affected me. Making music – to be able to express emotions, goodandbad – has definitely been a gift.View image in fullscreenDeftones in 1996, (from left) bassist Chi Cheng, singer Chino Moreno, turntablist Frank Delgado, drummer Abe Cunningham and guitarist Stephen Carpenter.Photograph: Gie Knaeps/Getty ImagesI work at HMV in a small town and we sell at least five copies of 1997’sAroundthe Furto teenagers every week – way more thanFleetwood Mac’s Rumours or Nirvana’s Nevermind. To what do you ascribe its longevity?DameHedwigI would hope it’s because we made some good records that have been able to transcend time, and that people of all ages find something within them they connect with. It’s probably no different from when I was a kid discovering groups like Led Zeppelin. And I’m not saying that we’re as great as them, but those bands were around for many years before I discovered them. I was able to connect with what they created, and it’s a lovely thing. We’ve always made a constant decision to not date ourselves with the music we make. We were always afraid of being lumped-in with the nu metal groups that came up at the same time we did. Not that we felt we were in another league; we just wanted to have our own identity. So we would make certain creative decisions to try not to fall too deep into any category.Deftones’Covers compilation shows a wide range of influences, including a number ofBritish artists from the 1980ssuch as Duran Duran,the Cure,the Smithsand Sade. How much of an influencewere they on your music?JimmyDIt’s the first music that I fell in love with, and it seemed very exotic to me as a sixth-grader. When you’re watching videos by Duran Duran, and they’re cruising on yachts in Sri Lanka, it just seemed like this music from far away. It was the 80s, and this stuff was pop music, but a lot of my friends were listening to Michael Jackson and stuff like that. And I loved that as well, but this British music was different. I felt very … selective, that I had this music that nobody else knew about. And there’s things there that I’ve carried over toDeftones. We’re still a hard rock/metal group, but I’ve snuck some of those influences in. And it’s not shoehorned; it’s very natural, because I genuinely have an affinity with this music.View image in fullscreenMoreno at Lollapalooza in Chicago, 2024.Photograph: Josh Brasted/FilmMagicIt seems your recent albums have had deeper, almost occult themes and symbolism. Is this intentional, orjust something unconscious coming out through your art?PhronesisIt’s unconscious. I’ve always been intrigued by things we don’t understand. It’s not me buying into any of these things at all – it’s just being curious about that which I don’t understand. I don’t do it for shock value. When I was a kid, my grandmother would go to church, and all of us kids would go to the kids’ church group, where they gave us an illustrated book of stories from the Bible. It had the scariest illustrations. I would stare for hours at these illustrations of, like, King Solomon holding up a baby by its feet. And then I’d read the story, these two people fighting over who the baby belonged to, and Solomon chopping it in half. It boggles me to this day, that it would be something a kid might read. But I’ve always had a curiosity about stuff like that.What music did you listen to when you were 22?JlimblessI was probably touring and listening to a lot of early electronic stuff and trip-hop. I was really into Portishead, Unkle, DJ Shadow and Tricky. I still love that music. It was marrying a lot of things that I love: sample-driven music, drum-forward music. It had a lot of the elements of hip-hop, but slowed down, and there was a lot of romantic imagery within it.I listen to a lot of the songs fromEros [Deftones’ unfinished sixth album, abandoned after bassist Chi Cheng was left comatose after a carcrashin 2008; he died of complications from theaccidentin 2013] floating around the internet – Dallas especially. Do you think that record will ever see the light of day?weavermachineWe’re always asked about Eros. It will most likely never see the light of day. That would involve going back to that period and resurrecting unfinished things, and somehow bringing them to completion. Dallas is the only song that was anywhere near finished. This new album started with ideas we’d been working on alone, through the pandemic. And when we got together to actually start making the record, none of us wanted to look back at those ideas from the pandemic – we wanted to capture the moment we’re in today. So going back to try to capture what was happening back during Eros, and finishing those ideas, doesn’t really make sense.Usually for me, it’s the heavier, the better– but then I heard Sextape [from 2010’s Diamond Eyes], which I love (and its mellower parts, especially).What inspired the lyrics, and how did it become the banger it is?danozismI don’t have any recollection of writing the words. A lot of our songs are written very abstract, to paint a picture of afeeling. There’s three notes that go through the whole of Sextape, and they’re very lush and beautiful – they take that side of us to the extreme. There’s beauty there, in the sonics of it. Lyrically, I just ran with that emotion.How do you separate your different creative modesbetweenDeftones and your other projects?MdrudolphI don’t. Each is its own thing, but I don’t approach them in any different way. I react how Chino would react. What I mean is, there’s no such thing as “Chino from Deftones” and “Chino from Crosses” and “Chino from Team Sleep”. There’s just one Chino. And I just react to what’s presented to me, musically, as myself. [A pause] I don’t often refer to myself in the third person. Actually, I feel like that was the first time. And I felt really weird doing that!View image in fullscreenDeftones in 2025.Photograph: PRYour cover of the Sade song No Ordinary Loveis just otherworldly. Did she ever get to listen to it or give any feedback?LazygunnThat was sacred ground because, as an artist, Sade’s unique. Even when we were recording it, it felt like a very self-indulgent thing to be doing. We weren’t intending for it to come out. The demo was recorded in my garage; we really just made it for ourselves. The fact that it ever saw the light of day at all was scary, to be honest. If you’d asked me, “Would you want to cover a Sade song, and other people are going to hear it, including possibly Sade?”, I would never have done it. I’m glad peopledolike it. I’m not sure that she’s ever heard it.If you could go back in time and offer advice to your younger self, what would you tell him?Zack_S917There’s a lot of life lessons that I had to learn the hard way, and they created the person that stands here today. I don’t have many huge regrets in life, because it all shaped who I’ve become. That said, it might be nice to go back to a few moments and tap myself on the shoulder and say, “No – gothatway.”You must get atonof love from fans, and I imagine thegiftscan get pretty creative. What’s one of the sweetest or coolestthingsyou’ve received from a fan?StarrXperiencePeople often give me drawings of myself. I always wonder what they assume I will do with them. I don’t even like to look atphotosof myself. They’re all different types of drawings – there’s cartoony ones, pen and ink ones. And I think it must bring the artist some kind of joy, that I’m holding on to a piece of art they created. “You shared your art with me – I want to share my art with you.” I do appreciate it. But because of that, I have stacks and stacks, hundreds of drawings of myself in my house.Private Music is released 22 August on Reprise/WarnerExplore more on these topicsDeftonesFilm & Music reader interviewMetalPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

He kept dead mice in his freezerDavid Lynch was an artist first, and a film-maker second (later, he’d also be a photographer, a songwriter and musician, a furniture designer and many other things). He would create works of visual art right up to his final days, but the most infamous would remain his “kits” – a pair of pieces he made in the late 1970s and early 80s, in which parts of a real, dissected animal (first a fish, then a chicken) were pinned to a board, along with kid-friendly instructions on how to reassemble and play with it.David Lynch has your number. But does it add up?Read moreLater he would tell an interviewer that he was in the early stages of planning a mouse kit, with the requisite parts bagged up in his freezer. Sadly, this never came to pass, but Lynch would continue to use unusual objects – from dead bees to cigarette ashes – in his artworks over the coming decades.View image in fullscreenHe built props for his debut feature Eraserhead (1976).Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy6. He adopted, befriended and then ghosted five Woody WoodpeckersView image in fullscreenWoody Woodpecker.Photograph: Ronald GrantIn 1981, Lynch was driving past a gas station on Sunset Boulevard when he noticed five stuffed Woody Woodpecker dolls hanging from a hook in the window. Executing a sharp U-turn, he went in to buy them. Naming them Bob, Dan, Pete, Buster and Chucko, he would keep them in his office, to make him happy.“These guys aren’t just a bunch of goofballs,” he would insist. “They know there is plenty of suffering in the world … But they tell me there’s a pervading happiness underneath everything, and the more time I spend with them, the more I believe it.” Sadly, the friendship couldn’t last – when the dolls began exhibiting “certain traits” that were “not so nice”, Lynch and his boys had to part ways.5. He very nearly directed the third Star Wars movieView image in fullscreenLynch was approached to direct Return of the Jedi.Photograph: Lucasfilm/Fox/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockThe list of unproduced David Lynch projects is long and varied, but perhaps the most infamous is the film that came to be titled Return of the Jedi. After The Elephant Man and its eight Oscar nominations, Lynch was suddenly the hot new director on the block, with offers coming in from, among others, Star Wars mastermind George Lucas. They had a meeting to discuss the project, and Lynch always said that he called Lucas right away to say a firm no, and urge him to direct the movie himself. However, writer Max Evry recently revealed that, in fact, the discussions continued for some time, and Lynch remained Lucas’s top choice for several weeks after their meeting, only turning him down when the contracts came through for another sandy space saga – the ill-fated Dune. And it’s probably for the best – the thought of Lynch let loose in Jabba the Hutt’s palace is deeply unsettling.4. He gave himself a hernia laughing at Angelo Badalamenti trying to sing‘The perfect accompaniment to life’: why is a 12th-century nun the hottest name in experimental music?Read moreDuring a recording session for a track featured on the soundtrack of his 1992 masterpiece Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, Lynch laughed so hard at his close friend and musical partner, composer Angelo Badalamenti, that he ended up in hospital with a severe hernia. The track they were working on – pounding jazz-funk droner “A Real Indication” – required Badalamenti to speak-sing Lynch’s lyrics in a growling, booming, wildly over-enunciated pseudo-Midwestern accent, which the director found so hysterical he did himself a serious injury. It was worth it, though – the soundtrack is regularly voted among the best of all time.3. He produced a whole album of 12thcentury religious musicView image in fullscreenHildegard Von Bingen.Photograph: Science History Images/AlamyIn the mid-1990s, despite the aforementioned hernia, Lynch was becoming ever more involved in writing, playing and producing music. It would be 2011 before Lynch would finally release an album of self-penned tracks under his own name, but in the meantime he’d embark on a number of musical explorations, from electric blues outfit BlueBOB, to the records he made with Texas-born chanteuse Chrystabell. But perhaps the oddest is Lux Vivens, or Living Light, an album credited to Lynch and Jocelyn Montgomery, formerly of Britain’s own sultry goth madrigal outfit, Miranda Sex Garden. Obsessed with the music of 12th-century German nun Hildegard Von Bingen, Montgomery persuaded Lynch to collaborate with her on an LP of Von Bingen’s spiritual songs, crafting a series of choral hymns backed by drones built from violin, guitar and manipulated “found sounds”, including swords and bulls.2. He was totally obsessed with Mad MenView image in fullscreenDavid Lynch with Mad Men actors Elisabeth Moss and Jon Hamm.Photograph: Joerg Carstensen/EPA/ShutterstockHaving been suspicious of television when he was younger (except for legal drama Perry Mason, which he loved) in the last decades of his life Lynch became a big fan of TV drama. It may have helped that he basically reinvented the format with Twin Peaks, and every show that came after it – from The Sopranos to Lost to Breaking Bad – owed him a huge debt. But his favourite show in this period was 60s-set ad-exec drama Mad Men. Lynch became so emotionally engaged with it that when he met series stars Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss, he was unable to call them by their names, and instead simply referred to them as their characters, Don and Peggy. “We went with it,” Moss would reveal later, though it seems Lynch didn’t give them much choice.1. He hated big tablesView image in fullscreenDavid Lynch in his Los Angeles screening room.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/APLynch was a builder – of worlds, of dreams, of furniture. As a kid he would undertake construction projects with his dad, learning how to use tools and mend fences, and in later life he would find employment as a house-builder, interior decorator and plumber. (“It’s a very satisfying thing,” he would say, “to direct water succesfully.”)Having built most of the props for his early, experimental films – including the mutant baby in his debut feature Eraserhead, whose precise components remain a mystery, though everything from umbilical cords to rabbit foetuses have been suggested – Lynch would later turn to crafting his own furniture, sometimes for a film shoot (several of his pieces appear in Lost Highway) and sometimes just for fun.

Along with Trump’s martial takeover of Washington DC, this week’s instalment, titled Sickofancy, takes aim at artificial intelligence (specifically ChatGPT) and the larger tech-bro industry.Picking up where we last left off, the show’s resident doofus, Randy Marsh, sees his beloved Tegridy Weed marijuana farm raided by border patrol agents. They kidnap all of his workers (“Hey! Those are my Mexicans!”), leaving him with only one employee, the ever-stoned Towelie (a talking bath towel, naturally). Despondent, Randy turns toChatGPTfor advice. The sycophantic, soft-voiced app draws up a new business plan for him and Towelie to implement. With the help of a single Mexican whom they spring from an Ice detention centre and plenty of recreational ketamine, they rebrand to Techridy, “an AI-powered marijuana platform for global solutions”.Meanwhile, in Washington, President Trump takes a break from receiving lavish gifts (as well as assurances that “you do not have a small penis”) from politicians, business titans and foreign leaders to remake the capital into a dystopian police state festooned with his own image (which includes his less-than-impressive member).The two storylines converge when Randy attempts to bribe Trump into legalising marijuana nationwide by bequeathing Towelie to him. It’s all for naught, though, as ChatGPT’s advice proves useless and he ends up having to sell Tegridy Farms and move his family back to the suburbs (the end of an era for the show, which has heavily featured this subplot for seven years, much to the annoyance of some fans).Lewd, crude and politically astute: South Park’s history of controversyRead moreParker and Stone’s take on AI – that it is dumbing us down, robbing us of person-to-person connection and giving us really, really bad advice – is refreshingly clear-eyed, if not particularly incendiary. The larger skewering of tech bros is solid, although it’s slightly disappointing that Elon Musk never gets brought in for any of it, even though the running gag about ketamine addiction is clearly aimed at him. That said, the digs at Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg help fill that gap.The Trump material remains roundly funny and it’s clear the show is building to a big conclusion, most likely involving his unwilling partner and lover Satan (who is finally taking steps to free himself from the abusive relationship).This episode is unlikely to cause as big a stir as the previous two. But watching South Park satirise the horrifying militarisation of Washington DC in real time – Union Station, which features in the show’s central montage, was the scene of a fascist photo op featuring vice-president JD Vance, defence secretaryPete Hegsethand White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller – is another reminder that no show has ever worked harder to have its finger on the nation’s pulse.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionAnimation on TVUS televisionDonald TrumpPete HegsethJD VancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We meet the maker of a jaw-dropping documentary about a growing phenomenonAmy HawkinsThu 21 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 21 Aug 2025 00.06 EDTShareNot long into Mistress Dispeller, a quietly jaw-dropping new documentary from director Elizabeth Lo, the film’s eponymous character lays out her thesis for ridding marriages of troublesome extra lovers. “When someone becomes a mistress,” she says, “it’s because they feel they don’t deserve complete love. She’s the one who needs our help the most.”Wang Zhenxi, a mistress dispeller based in north-central China’s Henan province, is one of a growing number of self-styled professionals who earn a living by intervening in people’s marriages – to “dispel” them of intruders. “I was looking for a love story set inChina,” says Lo, speaking from Hong Kong. “I thought it would be really interesting to [explore] the peripheral gaze of a mistress.”We see Mrs Li storm out in faux anger at her husband’s cooking – in a ploy to leave him alone with the dispellerLo’s first feature,the award-winning Stray, followed abandoned dogs on the streets of Istanbul. It was praised for its gentle, non-judgmental perspective on human (and canine) relationships. Mistress Dispeller is similarly restrained, allowing the film’s central protagonists – Mr and Mrs Li, his mistress Fei Fei, and her dispeller – to be seen as fully rounded, sympathetic people.At its core, the film is, to western audiences, culturally confounding. A woman discovers that her husband is having an affair. Rather than confronting him, she hires another woman to befriend her husband. Teacher Wang, as this mistress dispeller is known, uses powers of persuasion and deception to manipulate the husband and his lover, in an effort to end their relationship. If all goes to plan, it’s happily ever after for the married couple –andfor the mistress who, in Teacher Wang’s view, is set free.View image in fullscreen‘You never call it what it is head-on’ ... mistress Fei Fei (front left) and dispeller Teacher Wang (front right)Teacher Wang’s profession, if it can be called that, has only become a phenomenon in China in the last 10 years. As the country grapples withfalling marriage rates, rising divorce rates and an increasing number of young people refusing to wed altogether, an entire “love industry” aimed at promoting and protecting the institution of marriage has emerged. There are dating camps, government-sponsored marriage initiatives and evendating appsaimed at parents wanting to set their unattached children up with partners. “Divorce is easy,” says Teacher Wang’s assistant on a live stream. “It’s easy to just leave. It’s harder to take responsibility and provide your family with a good life.”But while the struggle to find love is a universal one, hiring someone to pretend to be an old friend – so that they can persuade your husband to end his affair on your behalf – is not. Some viewers might wonder why the wife doesn’t just suggest couples therapy. Lo explains that, according to Teacher Wang, therapy is still very stigmatised in China. “To enter as a stranger and a professional into a private setting and ask someone to divulge their family struggles would be unthinkable.” Teacher Wang “would be ejected immediately”.The dispeller dynamic, while grounded in the strong cultural desire to save face, may seem very deceptive to western audiences. But Lo believes that, despite the profound conflict, there is a “kindness in doing that to each other”. She explains: “On one hand, you can say it’s very repressive, and you’re not fully dealing with the problem at its root. But from another angle, it’s also an incredibly graceful way of resolving a conflict in which nobody has to lose face. You never call it what it is head-on.”View image in fullscreenPainfully awkward scenes ... Mr and Mrs LiThe indirect approach to family conflict is reminiscent ofThe Farewell, the 2019 semi-autobiographical feature directed by Lulu Wang, a Chinese-American film-maker. The Farewell tells the story of a family who, upon learning that the grandmother has terminal cancer, decide to keep the information from her, instead hastily organising a wedding so that the relatives can gather to say goodbye to the oblivious matriarch. While the film was hailed as a bittersweet, eye-opening exploration of cultural differences in the west, some Chinese viewers found it unremarkable – why wouldn’t you lie to your grandma about her terminal cancer diagnosis?For Lo, making Mistress Dispeller was about exploring a culture different from, although closely related to, her own. Growing up in Hong Kong, which was a British colony until it was handed over to China in 1997, she devoured western romances such as Notting Hill and Bend It Like Beckham. But the storylines shaped an “idealised version of love” for the young Lo. “That version is counter to what I understood and observed love to be in my cultural context in Hong Kong, where love is bound up with duty, sacrifice. I really wanted to use this film as a way to get to know mainland China, because I’m from Hong Kong – and to represent the type of love, and vision of family, that feels distinct to Hollywood films.”View image in fullscreenComplex set-up … director Elizabeth Lo.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images for IMDbBut Hong Kong and China also have unique traditions, some of which help to explain how a job like Teacher Wang’s could exist on the mainland. China’s Cultural Revolution – a decade of upheaval and chaos between 1966 and 1976 in which many familial and social bonds were destroyed – shattered traditional hierarchies. So, says Lo, while certain beliefs and customs still run deep, China is in many ways less orthodox than Hong Kong. “A lot of dating coaches and matchmakers we talked to in mainland China said dating today in China is like the wild west, because there are no rules. People are making them up as they go.”At times, Teacher Wang’s approach certainly seems ruthless. The aim is to make the mistress feel “abandoned on a cold bench”. The situation is “just like a war. You either win or lose everything.” But the overarching feeling that emerges through the documentary’s many layers is compassion. The husband truly feels torn between his two loves. The wife shows respect for the mistress, and vice versa. Teacher Wang ultimately treats everyone with kindness.That empathy helps to answer the other burning question that the viewer has after watching Mistress Dispeller: how on earth did the cameras get in? Much of the drama unfolds in the intimacy of the married couple’s dining room, with the viewer brought so close to the scene that it feels like being a guest at a painfully awkward dinner party. In one scene, the wife, stage-managed by Teacher Wang, storms out of the room in faux anger at her husband’s cooking – a ploy to get him alone with Teacher Wang.Lo’s approach to ethical film-making required a complex set of arrangements, whereby some of the characters were initially told they were agreeing to be in a documentary about “modern love and dating in China”. Only after Teacher Wang’s work was done, and the truth was revealed, were the film crew able to reveal their true role in the process, and ask once again for consent.Lo says the fact that they agreed is “testament to how Wang was able to build such trust”. In particular, the wife agreed because Teacher Wang persuaded her that by sharing her story – and her approach to dealing with the common but rarely discussed problem of infidelity – she could help other women.Mistress Dispeller review – goodness and vulnerability shine through in candid love triangle docRead moreDespite the tension between the two women, the wife shows remarkable compassion to the mistress, something that builds as the documentary reaches its apex. While the relationships in the film may feel uniquely Chinese, Lo does make one final observation. Love, she says, “is the most relatable thing in the world”.Mistress Dispeller will be released in the UK from 22 August exclusively at Bertha DocHouse, LondonExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsChinaMarriageRelationshipsAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, 20 years on, its star and writer return with a stage revival – but they insist it’s no victory lapThu 21 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTShareDrugs, gangs, kidnappings, police corruption, murder, even necrophilia. While this might sound like the stuff of a grisly crime drama, in reality it’s the backdrop to the strange and surreal BBC sitcom Ideal. A black comedy centred on a low-level weed dealer, Moz (played by Johnny Vegas), the show has become a beloved cult classic since its original run from 2005 to 2011.After years spent lingering in the digital abyss, episodes were finally uploaded to iPlayer last year and now, 20 years since it first aired, the show is returning for a live stage production. “I didn’t appreciate how original it was when we were making it,” says Vegas, sitting in the restaurant of a plush five-star hotel in Manchester, a far cry from the rodent-infested flat he spent years in as Moz. “You only appreciate it years later, when folks are coming up going: ‘That was the one show that spoke to me – that was my life.’”As a genuinely inventive and countercultural word-of-mouth hit, the show picked up obsessive followers; there’s a dedicated Facebook group where fans share quotes, memes and clips; people gush about it on Reddit threads and have made Spotify playlists to recreate its soundtrack. When its stage return was announced, several shows sold out instantly. “There was no guarantee there’d be an audience for Ideal in 2025,” says creator and writer Graham Duff, who also plays Brian, a hilariously snippy and flamboyant gay man with an infinite number of men on his arm. “But the response has been wonderful. The phrase we keep hearing is: ‘Why has it taken so long?’”There is a feeling of unfinished business. The show was cancelled abruptly, leaving Ideal without a neat wrap-up. “Every series, I wrote the final episode thinking this could be the last one,” says Duff. “The only time I didn’t do that was [the final] series seven. By that stage, the viewing figures were so good, and we had Kiefer Sutherland saying he was going to appear in the next series. I thought: now I can stop looking over my shoulder. So it felt really brutal. We had a lot more to say.”View image in fullscreenHere’s Johnny … a younger Vegas on the set of Ideal.Photograph: Chris Bull/AlamyThe TV show featured Moz, his girlfriends, bent coppers, a gangster called Psycho Paul, a hitman called Cartoon Head (a silent character who never removed their cartoon mouse mask), some utterly bizarre neighbours, and everyone from kids and schoolteachers and DJs all swinging by to skin up and buy cannabis. It also featured a spectacular list of guest stars. Julia Davis played a partly blind clairvoyant who claims she foresaw 9/11 in a Cup-a-Soup. Sean Lock was a transgender love interest of Brian’s son (a plotline that also involves some accidental incest). Paul Weller popped up as himself, and they even managed to cast Mark E Smith, late frontman of the post-punk band the Fall, as Jesus Christ. “There’s only one person who ever turned us down,” says Duff, “and that was Kate Moss. Everybody else couldn’t say yes quick enough but her agent said she wouldn’t do anything related to drugs.”“It was a show that, against the odds, kept going,” adds Vegas. “It was almost unwanted – we were the runt of the litter at BBC Three.” The BBC, he says, “didn’t know what to do with it”. There was talk of a film to be directed by Ben Wheatley, who did series five and six of the show, but it never materialised. Then in 2021, Vegas saw the live stage show of another beloved and arguably overlooked BBC show, Early Doors. It triggered an idea: “I thought: That’s a beautiful way to get around the system,” he says.I’m not interested in nostalgia and: Oh, do you remember that thing from back then?Graham DuffThe live show will pick up 20 years later with Moz, unsurprisingly, still a dealer in his and Cartoon Head’s flat. “The story is partly a murder mystery,” explains Duff, who is keen to keep details to a minimum, “with each of Moz’s regular customers under suspicion. Moz also has a new girlfriend, Liza, and my character now has an OnlyFans – because, of course he has.”In the original TV show, Duff created a world that was vast but also intensely claustrophobic. There’s only one scene out of 53 episodes that ventures outside: everything else is shot in Moz’s or his neighbours’ flats, with an ever-rotating cast of oddballs. “At the time I was thinking: I reckon at least a quarter of the country smokes weed and will have been to a dealer,” says Duff. “But how often do you see it on TV? I thought there’s something in that: it’s a locus for all these people to cross and interact.” As such, the show isn’t really about drugs, nor was it ever intended to be. “I’ve always hated things like Cheech and Chong, where it’s like: Oh, I was so out of it I did this crazy thing,” says Duff. “I’ve got zero interest in that. It’s no more about drugs than Only Fools and Horses is about stolen goods. It’s about those characters and their interactions, dynamics, aspirations and disappointments.”The pair clearly love talking about the show. Vegas sips a vodka soda, Duff a cranberry juice, and in the deserted restaurant hall this afternoon, their frequent howls of laughter echo through the room. Vegas recalls the “spliff-making bootcamp” he had to go on before the first series, because he wasn’t much of a cannabis smoker himself. “I couldn’t get creative by smoking weed,” he says. “It just made me play [PlayStation game] Toca Racing and eat loads of toast.” He also recalls the time he and the cast had been out the night before and came in on two hours’ sleep, a bit too wobbly. A producer deemed him unfit for work, and he was told to go and lie down. “We had the best time,” says Vegas. “We worked hard, we played hard, but we delivered. I was gifted a character that always looked worse for wear.”However, such shenanigans were limited to series one. “By the second series, we all realised we were doing something that had some gravity to it,” says Duff. “We needed to protect it.” Vegas’s performance is some of his best work. Spending 53 episodes with a permanently stoned, adulterous work-shy drug dealer, confined largely to his living room, only works because Vegas is able to show him as funny, vulnerable, occasionally tender, and likable, as well as a bit of a dope. “It might be the closest thing I have given to a nuanced performance,” Vegas says, with typical self-deprecation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Several of the cast work as standup comics [Emma Fryer, Joanna Neary and Ben Crompton are all confirmed] so they know a thing or two about live comedy timing. Plus, seeing the action play out in real time really elevates the suspense – and there’s a lot of suspense in this play.”However, one thing they are clear to point out is that this is not going to be some greatest hits rehash. “I’m aware of what it means to fans and I don’t want to trample on that,” says Duff. “But it can’t just be a celebration. I want somebody who’s never seen Ideal on TV to be able to watch it and be gripped. I’m not interested in nostalgia and ‘Oh, do you remember that thing from back then? Yeah, we brought it back, and it’s almost as good as it used to be.’ Fuck that. It’s got to be bulletproof and enjoyable in its own right. I just hope people think we’ve done Ideal justice.”Vegas nods along, taking a sip of his drink, before adding: “And, if it’s shit, it’s all Graham’s fault.”Idealtoursfrom 8 Septemberto 11 October; tour starts Salford.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTheatreJohnny VegasTV comedyComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)featuresShareReuse this content"

Instead, it features Cardinal himself, performing and deconstructing the kind of “land acknowledgment” with which public performances in North America are nowadays introduced. To Cardinal, the ritual is a vacuous apology in lieu of reparations or reversal of the original offence. But, if we’re in the acknowledgment game – well, there are plenty of other issues around Indigenous life, and the lives of those of us in the audience, that could use some acknowledging.What follows bears scant similarity to Shakespeare, only a little to theatre, and slightly more to lecture-meets-standup;Hannah Gadsby’s Nanetteleaps to mind. Like Nanette, Cardinal’s show majors in making its audience as uncomfortable as possible, as he arraigns us with Britain’s history of genocidal violence, the feebleness of our presumed allyship with oppressed groups – and, latterly, with the discovery of the remains of hundreds of Indigenous children at school sites around Canada. He prowls the stage, wired, angry, cracking bleak jokes, as one disgruntled festivalgoer after another makes for the exit.Fat Ham review – Hamlet becomes a booty-shaking barbecue in glittery Pulitzer winnerRead moreThat’s understandable: this is a confrontational performance. It’s also one created in a North American context, that loses something in translation at the Edinburgh international festival – not least its audience’s stake in the “land acknowledgment” convention. Not all of Cardinal’s transpositions to the UK feel well informed. Some of his generalisations, about white prejudice and virtue signalling, rankle and feel cynical. His arguments take “jumps in logic”, by his own admission, that make them hard to follow.But there are hard truths here, too, about the stubbornness of systemic subjugation and the racism inherent even in positive representations of Indigenous life. In any event, Cardinal seems beyond aesthetic or ideological fine-tuning at this point, and his As You Like It is less “insinuating with us in the behalf of a good play” (in Rosalind’s words), more howl of pain and anger. It’s an act of reverse colonisation, seizing our space and making it his own. It’s not always agreeable, but it demands to be heard.AtChurch Hill theatre, Edinburgh, until 23 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalAs You Like ItComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Isthiswhat we had in mind? The joke is on the queasy atmosphere the Mancunian establishes at his shows, barking in the audience’s faces, behaving unstably and – this time around – loudly bellowing “I tried to suck off my dad”, over and over again. Is there a therapist in the house? Well, there doesn’t need to be, because Tiernan has devised “the System”, a three-point plan to heal himself after a drug-induced psychotic episode between Glastonbury 2024 andlast year’s Edinburgh fringe show.We are three new shows into the 29-year-old’s fringe career now, and All In again finds him addressing his dyspraxia, his drug use and his failure to fit in. I hanker for the show that directs his considerable comic talents elsewhere, but in the meantime, this is his strongest offering so far, the self- and audience-abusing comedy now underpinned by structure and tending towards a big payoff. It begins with an inventory of the drugs Tiernan used to take, then splices in stories from his beloved Glastonbury festival, including a keeper about smuggling his gear in a jar of Nutella.The freshest material addresses his internalised homophobia, as we journey from his teenage years, furtively fantasising over Justin Bieber, to (not very) grownup life lived in fear of gay sex – scarier than the hetero alternative, he argues, in characteristically lurid terms. His problems now laid out, Tiernan moves on to elucidate “the System” itself, neatly flipping the script and making way for a rousing, Glasto-alike finale.By then, Tiernan is stripped to the waist and performing with even wilder commitment than across the 50 minutes prior. You might wince now and then at the crudeness, occasionally superfluous, of his material: we don’t need the act-out after the elliptical gag about his mum, his backside and poppers. But more often than not Tiernan nails it here, with a surreptitiously tender tale of a manchild adrift just about visible behind all the stark gags about his very dysfunctional lifestyle.AtMonkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

You’d think the question barely needs asking – butElouise Eftoshas done so, and received quite the reaction. She makes a stellar fringe debut with Australia’s First Attractive Comedian, a tongue-in-cheek title some have treated, by her account, as no laughing matter.Should we be surprised the relationship between comedy, feminism and sexiness isn’t as resolved as we might have thought? In the space between them, the Perth comic makes great stacks of hay here, in a show premised on her extreme hotness. She chats to an audience member; we cut away to the erotic Elouise Eftos fantasy unfolding in that person’s head. She demonstrates the yawning gulf between herself and “normies”. She jokes about cat-calls, and the expulsion from the Beatles of handsome Pete Best. She makes common cause with her fellow bombshell, that innocent bank-teller turned patron saint of making wives jealous, Dolly Parton’s Jolene.Is it all a hilarious wind-up? Or are we to take Eftos’s lofty self-image at face value? The show’s neat trick is to be equally funny regardless, or because, of that ambiguity. Either way, Eftos has nailed a wickedly amusing and original stage persona, sky-high self-regard but charm in spades too, all flashed smiles, tossed hair and matter-of-fact superiority to we lesser mortals in her crowd.And, unlike beauty, the show is not only skin deep. In its later stages, Eftos keeps pushing her ideas – and what we might think about them – into material about sex, her body and a final sequence, in character as a malfunctioning “femmebot”, that implies some unstated ambiguity about the role she’s choosing (or has been forced?) to play.There’s also a questioning routine about the act’s feminist credentials, which get sharply challenged by one or two senior female comedians – whose shocking correspondence with Eftos is displayed on an upstage screen. Impudence – towards her elders, towards the comedy industry at large – is a feature of this fabulous provocation of a comedy hour, nipping and tucking at our ambivalent relationship with good looks.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

The BBC said another contestant would be drafted in to replace him.“With a heavy heart, I have to step back from this season of Strictly Come Dancing due to unexpected medical reasons,” Nairn said. “I was truly looking forward to the journey, and I’m deeply sorry to disappoint anyone who was looking forward to seeing me on the dancefloor. Thank you all for your support, and I will be back on my feet very soon, in every sense.”The actor became known for playing the laconic Hodor in the long-running TV seriesGame of Thrones. Asked at the height of the show’s fame if he ever got sick of being asked to repeat “Hodor” – the single line he delivered over and over – he said: “This is what I always tell people and it’s 100% true: 10 times more people ask me if I’m sick of being asked to say Hodor than actually ask me to say Hodor. It’s really weird, like a paradox.”In 2015, while still appearing on Game of Thrones, he released his debut single, a house track named Up (Club Mix) featuring Leanne Robinson, and embarked on a three-month tour across the US and UK.On Thursday, Strictly’s executive producer atBBCStudios, Sarah James, said: “We’ve absolutely loved getting to know Kristian in this short time, and he has all the makings of a brilliant Strictly Come Dancing contestant. We’re incredibly sorry to lose him from this year’s series and we all wish him a speedy recovery.”The new celebrity joining Strictly would be announced on the One Show on Thursday, the broadcaster said.Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingBBCEntertainment TVReality TVTelevisionGame of ThronesnewsShareReuse this content"

He then returned to make Gangs of New York with Martin Scorsese in 2002.Anemone is the debut feature of Day-Lewis’s son, Ronan, 27, who has previously worked primarily as a painter and made two short films, in 2016 and 2017.Drink it up!

In it, he bequeathed New Place, reputedly the second grandest house in Stratford-upon-Avon, to his own cousin Edward Nash.However, on Thomas’s death in 1647, Shakespeare’s daughter, Susanna Hall, and granddaughter Elizabeth, Thomas’s widow, refused to honour the will, claiming Shakespeare’s own will had decreed the property be left to them and Thomas had no right to bequeath it.The result was chancery court proceedings, lodged by Edward against Elizabeth, to claim the valuable property.The Nash will has now been rediscovered in a box of unlabelled chancery documents from the 17th century and earlier by Dr Dan Gosling, a principal legal records specialist at theNational Archives.“It was an incredible find,” said Gosling, who was sorting through the boxes, which were not catalogued or marked with dates or descriptions.A section of thee 1642 document.Photograph: The National ArchivesThe will was known about in the mid-19th century after being seen by a Shakespeare scholar when originally held in the Rolls chapel. When documents were later sorted it ended up in the unmarked box. “It wasn’t listed, and then was left there for about 150 years or so,” said Gosling.Shakespeare bought New Place, a three-storied timber and brick dwelling, for £60 in 1597 and lived there until his death in 1616. It had 10 fireplaces, five handsome gables and grounds large enough to incorporate two barns and an orchard.Thomas Nash made the will while living at New Place with his Susanna and Elizabeth. Though Shakespeare’s will had left his land and the property to his daughter and granddaughter, “it is possible Thomas Nash was making this will in the expectation that he would outlive Susanna and Elizabeth”, said Gosling.“But what actually happened was he died in 1647. He was very young. Elizabeth was still only 39 and in fact remarried afterwards.” Susanna died in 1649.Susanna and Elizabeth created a deed of settlement confirming their rights. “Then Edward Nash takes Elizabeth to court. He argues the will of Thomas Nash was proved in the property court of Canterbury, and Elizabeth Nash, as the widow and executrix, was duty bound to abide by the terms of the will and give New Place to Edward Nash.”Elizabeth appeared at the chancery court to explain the lands and property were granted to her and her mother by “my grandfather William Shakespeare”. As part of proceedings she was asked to produce Thomas’s will, which is how the document eventually ended up in the chancery archives, now held by the National Archives.The upshot of the proceedings is not clear, but, Gosling said, it appears Edward never got to own the property. When Elizabeth died in 1670, having had no children and ending Shakespeare’s direct line of descendants, her will stipulated Edward Nash would have the right to acquire New Place.“She uses the words ‘according to my promise formally made to him’, which suggests some spoken procedures were made,” said Gosling. In the event, there is no recorded mention of Edward as owner of New Place, which went to the wealthy landowning Clopton family after Elizabeth’s death and was demolished in 1702.“It is such a lucky find,” said Gosling. “The chancery case is known about among some Shakespeare scholars and is mentioned in some Shakespeare histories but they always seem to refer back to the 19th century discovery of the will.”Now the original is documented, catalogued and available to the public for the first time in more than a century.Explore more on these topicsWilliam ShakespeareNational ArchivesnewsShareReuse this content"

People walk slowly between two dense hedges of windfallen oak branches, or stand silently in a fragile cage of bulrush stems with light seeping through the mossy skylight overhead. I’m visiting the largest ever indoor exhibition ofwork by Andy Goldsworthy, one of Britain’s most influential nature artists. His recent installations have a visceral sense of rural landscape: hare’s blood on paper, sheep shit on canvas, rusty barbed wire, stained wool, cracked clay.The show is a sensory celebration of earth – its textures and temperatures, colours, character. The seasons cycle through an ongoing multidecade series of photos featuring the same fallen elm. There are leaf patterns and delicate woven branches, crusts of snow, lines of summer foxglove flowers or autumn rosehips. Andy Goldsworthy: Fifty Years is a National Galleries of Scotland (NGS) exhibition in the neoclassical Royal Scottish Academy building.View image in fullscreenBarbara Hepworth’s Ascending Form (Gloria) at the Royal Botanic Garden.Photograph: Antonia ReeveAfter the exhibition, as a sort of cultural pilgrimage, I’m walkingsix miles across Edinburghin search of works by the Dumfriesshire-based Goldsworthy and other artists who engage with the landscape. I start at the Royal Botanic Garden (free and open daily,rbge.org.uk), a short bus ride north of the National Gallery. Just inside the east gate, there’s aperforated sculpture by Barbara Hepworthwith sunlight pouring through it.“Art has made me look at the world … and engage with what’s around me,” Goldsworthy writes in the notes for Fifty Years. Walking up through shady beeches, blazing wildflowers and scented, bee-buzzing lavender, there’s a bronze girl in a waterlily pond, and a sundial by the Scottish artist and writer Ian Hamilton Finlay near the terrace cafe. Finlay’s best-known artwork is the garden he created with his wife, Sue, in the wild Pentland Hills (£15 over-16s, £10 for 10-15s, under-10s free, open Thursday to Sunday until 28 September,littlesparta.org.uk). He also built a stone temple in the rolling, wooded acres ofJupiter Artland, a few miles from Edinburgh, where Goldsworthy has put rocks in trees and trees in a stone-walled barn (£11.80 adults, £7.50 children). Celebrating both artists, Jupiter’s exhibitionWork Begat Workruns until 28 September.In the Royal Botanic Garden, Goldsworthy’s Slate Cone stands next to Inverleith House, where the gallery is showing feminist photomontages byLinder(free, until 19 October), who opened this year’sEdinburgh art festival(until 24 August).

TheWater of Leith Walkwayruns close to the John Hope Gateway on Arboretum Place, and I follow it south-westwards. In Stockbridge, the Sunday market, shaded by whitebeam trees, offers loaves of artisanal bread, Perthshire strawberries andcakes made from insects. Almost hidden in branches under a bridge, a lifesize cast-iron figure stands in the river nearby, one ofAntony Gormley’s 6 Times statues.View image in fullscreenStone Coppice by Andy Goldsworthy at Jupiter Artland.Photograph: FocusCulture/AlamyAnother of the figures is buried chest-deep by the zebra crossing betweenNational Galleries Scotland: Modern One and Two. Wandering past domed St Bernard’s Well, with its statue of the goddess of health, and picturesque Dean Village, crammed with fellow camera-wielding visitors, I detour to the Modern galleries up the riverside steps. Linking both museums is Charles Jencks’ hugeLandform, with its grassy hills and curving pond. There are days’ worth of galleries, artists’ rooms and sculpture gardens to explore here, but the afternoon is passing and I have more miles and museums to cover.Heading back along the leafy Water of Leith, I climb another steep flight of steps towards Haymarket. On the south lawn ofSt Mary’s Episcopal Cathedral, a labyrinth winds through aromatic yarrow and knapweed. Around this flowering meadow, as part of an installation calledOn Sacred Ground, there are rough benches elegiacally listing threatened Scottish species: corncrake, hawfinch, wryneck, ring ouzel, capercaillie. I walk on throughPrinces Street Gardens, back past the Royal Academy building, and drop into theNational Gallery(free) next door to see Van Gogh’s impasto Olive Trees and William McTaggart’s stormy seascapes.View image in fullscreenOne of Antony Gormley’s 6 Times statues in the Water of Leith.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAUp more steps, pausing to look back at distant views of the firth, and then down again across photogenic Victoria Street. Finally, I stroll through Greyfriars Kirkyard to reach the National Museum of Scotland (free,nms.ac.uk). In 1998, Goldsworthy installed four sunset-coloured blocks of split sandstone on themuseum roof, with its panoramic city views. But the blue skies have turned stormy. “Our roof terrace is closed today – the weather is too dreich!” says a red sign by the lift.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s Hearth, a burned circle on a platform of salvaged wood from the museum’s construction site. Stacked Whalebonesis a pale ball of interlocking bones, the whole skeleton of a five-metre pilot whale found beached in Northumberland.

Among the crowds are buskers, jugglers, unicyclists. With just one night to sample its anarchic offerings, I plunge into dodgy cabarets and sweaty comedies in tiny underventilated venues. At 9pm, I’m back at the National Museum for an accomplished Lloyd-Webber-esquemusical about Van Gogh. Towards midnight, I head to Summerhall for a strange, polyphonicprequel to Hamletby the Polish choral-theatre group Song of the Goat.The next day, as I walk to Edinburgh’s Waverley station, there’s a prismatic haze caught between the misty drizzle and breezy summer sun. It reminds me of Goldsworthy’s 1980s photo series with titles likeRainbow Splash Hit Water With Heavy Stick Bright, Sunny, Windy. As the train speeds south, through Northumberland and North Yorkshire, I see with new eyes the wave-pounded cliffs and bale-studded headlands, the dry-stone walls and sheep-scattered patchwork dales.The trip wasprovided byVisit Scotland,NGSandLNER,(York to Edinburgh from £23 each way,London to Edinburgh from £52).

One moment you’re on a romantic walk in the woods with your saintly, supportive husband as he convinces you to stand for election as prime minister, the next youarethat prime minister (with the shorter but still flattering haircut to prove it). You’re knee-deep in a cancer drug supply crisis and about to meet with the French president who alone can solve your problem, when news arrives that your saintly, supportive husband – who is, of course, a doctor with Doctors Without Borders – and his team have been abducted by unknown terrorists in French Guiana. What is aSuranne Joneswith a Netflix budget behind her to do?That is the set-up from which five punchy hours – Hostage fully swerves the curse of streamer-bloat – of great, globetrotting fun proceeds. Jones is the no-nonsense (in a good way, not a Thatcher way) politician-turned-PM Abigail Dalton;Julie Delpyis the icy president and master strategist Vivienne Toussaint; and Ashley Thomas is Dr Alex Anderson, Dalton’s blameless and soon deeply traumatised husband. Before news of the kidnappings arrives, Dalton is hoping to cut a deal with Toussaint that will involve the UK taking in a boatful of Ebola-ravaged refugees that were refused entry at Calais in return for France giving the UK a large amount of lifesaving medicine. Deux political crises averted with une stone, you see. Then the terrorists step in and demand as their ransom Dalton’s resignation by 1pm the next day.I should add that also in the mix are: Abigail and Alex’s semi-stroppy daughter Sylvie (Isobel Akuwudike) and Abigail’s dying father Max (James Cosmo), both of whom are strongly of the opinion that she should resign and bring Alex home; private secretary Kofi Adomako (Lucian Msamati), an appointee of the previous government and as yet unsure of his new boss’s fitness for purpose; Adrienne Pelletier (Jehnny Beth), the ice queen’s warmer and surely trustworthy assistant; and last but decidedly not least, Toussaint’s stepson Matheo (Corey Mylchreest), who deplores his stepmother’s political shift to the right, and his new girlfriend Saskia (Sophie Robertson). Think of them as a quiverfull of arrows ready to be fired the moment we need another plot twist, red herring, complication, revelation or downright treachery, and always landing on target. Offshore accounts, leaks, misplaced and well-placed loyalties abound, with ever-changing political considerations and their ramifications woven credibly in.Oh, and did I mention that Dalton is considered to have “gutted the military” to fund her promises to fix the NHS? Though I’m sure this won’t have repercussions if and when she needs their help to rescue her husband and his equally saintly, supportive team.The first rescue mission, however, is by the French because it is their territory. Alas, it is aborted at the last minute when Toussaint receives a very effective blackmail video that threatens her leadership and would, if she were ousted, leave the way clear for a truly fascistic candidate to stand, which is what her apparent pandering to the right-wing has been designed to deflect. Hidden depths, you see, and subtleties. Hostage onion-skins its episodes very nicely.It’s a rollicking, propulsive and compulsive yarn that also manages to give two great parts to two women of a certain age then leaves them to get on with it as characters rather than symbols. There is perhaps a little too much of Dalton kicking off her high heels in relief every time she’s alone, but other than that the two leaders are as unremarkably female as the usual players would be unremarkably male. Of course, this shouldn’t still be rare, but it is, and feels refreshing and worthy of note.As losses mount, the question of how much a leader should be expected to sacrifice for her country comes under greater scrutiny. Does there come a point when you have to give in to terrorists? How do you appraise a concept like the greater good, which has become so emptied of meaning in modern times? And what if the great British public has been baying for your blood beforehand? And the sympathy they have for your predicament lasts no longer than the next viral video showing the death or suffering of an individual unable to procure the drugs they need?Everyone is terrific in this, and the budget is well spent on location shoots in French Guiana (or somewhere very like it), with Jones doing her usual sterling work as an everywoman in extraordinary circumstances. Or at least everywoman as prime minister in extraordinary circumstances. I do find myself occasionally wishing that she would treat herself and us to a comedy – or something with a comic aspect – more often, but when the dramas are this much fast, furious, intelligent fun, I suppose we shouldn’t ask for more.Hostage is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJulie DelpySuranne JonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to imagine a writer shedding new light on the band given the mountain of literature already in existence. But there is a freshness of perspective in Ian Leslie’s book, which tells of Lennon and McCartney’s unique alchemy through the songs they wrote together. Leslie’s background in psychology serves him well in a study that jettisons the usual narrative of male rivalry; their partnership, Leslie suggests, was closer to a marriage.He begins with the pair’s early songwriting sessions, usually in McCartney’s front room, where rather than each taking ownership of songs, they worked in sync. Other fabled musical partnerships such as Leiber and Stoller, or Rodgers and Hammerstein, divided the labour between lyrics and melody, but Lennon and McCartney worked together on both. Pointing to their profound connection, Leslie notes how in the song If I Fell they performed “an intricate courtship dance, moving apart and close again as the song unfolds, like birds weaving in and out of each other’s flight path, alternately shielding and leading the other”.The Thick of It actor Chris Addison is the book’s fluent and engaging narrator, and his enthusiasm for the topic is clear. The audio edition also has a bonus chapter featuring a terrific conversation between Leslie and presenter and podcaster Geoff Lloyd, where they ponder the continued enthusiasm for all things Beatles: “In terms of scale and complexity of achievement, there’s very few people who come close to what John and Paul did,” says Leslie. “People say ‘Do we need more books about the Beatles?’ It’s only just begun, in my view.”Available via Faber, 14hr 9minFurther listeningStone Yard DevotionalCharlotte Wood, Sceptre, 6hr 36minThis novel by The Natural Way of Things author finds a middle-aged woman leaving her life and marriage in Sydney to return to the religious community in the Australian outback where she grew up.

That’s not forgetting the riddlers, slaggers and snobs. And before you say anything, these are all occupations that were once ubiquitous but are now vanishingly rare: a bodger makes chair legs; a badger is someone who etches glass; a fat boy is a greaser of axles in haulage systems, while a snob is a journeyman maker of boots and shoes.According to the main charity that supports traditional skills, 285 crafts are still practised in Britain, of which more than half are endangered. Seventy-two are on the critical list and it is these, and the people who practise them, that James Fox sets out to record. He meets the Nobles, who are the pre-eminent stone-walling family “in Britain, if not the world”. Mostly they stick close to home, in the West Yorkshire village where they have farmed, and walled, for centuries. Building a dry-stone wall requires an extraordinary kind of embodied knowledge, the sort that knows instinctively how to use gravity, friction and exactly the right-shaped rock to build a structure that allows moorland gales to whistle through and remain standing. Done right, a dry-stone wall will last 200 years, compared with a post-and-wire fence which needs replacing after 20.It would be nice to report that a walling renaissance is underway. Not exactly, says Fox, for the simple reason that it is uneconomical: even with government subsidy, a waller typically gets less than £85 a metre, working in conditions that only allow for a few metres a day. However, there is a lucrative demand from the owners of private landscaped gardens and tourist attractions. The Nobles recently flew to Japan to build a wall in Cotswold stone for a complex in Gifu. Fox urges us not to judge, emphasising that “crafts have always responded to the evolving needs of society”.This matter-of-fact attitude is shared by many of the people who appear in this book. Some of them downright dislike what Fox dubs “the C-word”. One Devonshire wheelwright explains that “craft” to him suggests a church fayre. “I’m not a craftsman, this isn’t a hobby, and I’m not keeping anything ‘alive’. This here is a trade.” Felicity Irons, a rush merchant and weaver who makes her living on the Great Ouse, barks furiously at Fox when he gauchely asks her on a cold November morning if she finds her job relaxing. “Of course it isn’t. It’s bloody hard work, just like any other job.” Even a woman whom Fox interviews in Hackney Wick making ceramic noodle bowls rejects the “craft” tag, telling him sternly that she is a “multidisciplinary artist and researcher”.Despite the caveats and the pleas to remain hard-headed, Craftland is a book that shimmers with love for a dwindling world of meticulous, patient labour. Fox becomes positively lyrical when describing the work of Roger W Smith, a master horologist on the Isle of Man who makes watches that are so special that only 20 emerge from his workshop each year. Sheets of gold, steel, brass and beryllium are hauled into the machine room at the back of the building, and months later an intricate piece of engineering emerges, carefully swaddled, from the front. These delicate assemblages of wheels, levers and jewels perform a kind of philosophical magic, converting the invisible forces of the universe into an insistent tick. You won’t get one for under £300,000.Fox works hard to stiffen his account of Britain’s lost crafts with statistics, places and dates. Despite this, there is a feeling that this genre of impressionistic place-writing is reaching its own expiry date. Over the past 10 years we have been deluged by books recovering the lost heritages of knitting, fishing, letter-pressing, hill farming and much more. While the illustrations in Craftland are lovely, it feels inevitable that they are woodcuts, linocuts and pen-and-ink drawings, all pictorial forms that now border on the overfamiliar. Craftland is both deftly written and well researched, but it feels like the kind of publication that is itself slipping into obsolescence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

That live show, with the vital element of regular audience participation and dress-up, may in fact now have a bit more energy and point than the movie itself, which (whisper it) perhaps suffers a few longueurs.The undoubted star is the sonorous and feline Tim Curry playing Dr Frank-N-Furter, a vampirically queer alien sex god, proselytising here on Earth for borderless pleasure and describing himself as a “sweet transvestite transsexual from Transylvania”. Dr Furter toys with the affections of the many followers and servants at his giant castle in middle America, including his butler Riff-Raff (played by O’Brien) and tearaway Eddie (played by Meat Loaf). Dr Furter is actually focused on his Frankensteinian project of creating Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood), the ideal hunky blond male to service his needs. Even Dr Frankenstein didn’t actually want to have sex with his monster.One stormy night, while Dr Furter is presiding over another of his regular hideous debauches at the castle, a wholesome young all-American couple, saving themselves for marriage, turn up rain-drenched, and ask for help because their car has broken down – in which they had actually been listening, sadly and sympathetically, to Richard Nixon’s resignation address on the car radio. They are Brad, played by Barry Bostwick, and Janet, played by Susan Sarandon; her white bra and slip ensemble is incidentally the sexiest thing in the whole film. Dr Furter relieves both of them of their virginity, individually, and Brad and Janet finally get turned on to sensual pleasure, with the film reaching an orgasmic climax of eyeliner-and-fishnet-stocking-wearing musical theatre naughtiness.It is a genuine one-off, a movie whose own identity has now overshadowed its ostensible purpose: to spoof the classic movie chillers of yesteryear. There are pious invocations of Fay Wray in King Kong and Claude Rains in The Invisible Man, although Rocky Horror itself has long since become a spoofable mainstay and in any case cinephilia isn’t the point; the point is sex, the pervier and freakier the better. Don’t dream it, be it, says The Rocky Horror Picture Show, with all the fervency that Hair once sang about the dawning of the age of Aquarius. It seems a little quaint, but there’s still a high raunch factor.The Rocky Horror Picture Show is in UK cinemas from 22 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmRocky Horror ShowComedy filmsMusicals (Film)Tim CurryMeat LoafSusan SarandonreviewsShareReuse this content"

James Ijames’s play won a Pulitzer prize in 2022; set at a Southern backyard barbecue, its sensibility, Black and queer, does more than piggyback on Shakespeare’s tragedy.This play’s pensive prince is Juicy (a winning Olisa Odele). His father has just died in prison, and the sun-bright party celebrates the hasty marriage of Juicy’s mom and uncle. Strapping but soft, in his Mama’s Boy T-shirt, Juicy’s moping irks his new stepdaddy (“think he some kinda philosopher-poet”).Manning the grill is Uncle Rev: greedy, domineering, knows his way round a pig. A limber Sule Rimi plays Rev and the furious ghost of Juicy’s Dad, emerging from a gingham tablecloth to demand gut-spilling vengeance (“it’s a bit Old Testament,” winces Juicy). Hamlet is a tragedy of the young trapped in the ethics of their elders: Ijames lets them talk back. The ghost may crave justice, but was also a harsh father, mean husband and a murderer. Must Juicy live in his shadow?View image in fullscreenResplendent … Sandra Marvin in Fat Ham.Photograph: Ali WrightShakespeare’s characters are hemmed in by bad choices and narrow options. Here they dream big: this play’s Ophelia wants to open a shooting range, its Horatio ponders starting an OnlyFans account and Polonius becomes a clucking church lady with a past (Sandra Marvin, resplendent in mauve). What does Juicy want? He is still finding out.Audiences seeking Shakespeare references will be in hog heaven: the conscience-catching play becomes a game of charades, and people keep catching Juicy mid-soliloquy and wonder what secrets he’s spilling. Ijames’s writing is full of charm and crackle, and there’s a bravery in his refusal to valorise tragedy or trundle through inherited trauma. Why must stories end in death? What if we lose the swords and instead do shots?‘What if everyone didn’t die?’ The queer, Pulitzer-winning, happy-ending HamletRead moreThe play’s commitment to joy is elevated by the fun-times production (by Sideeq Heard, based on Saheem Ali’s original) and a terrific British cast (Jasmine Elcock’s glowering, kinetic Opal is a particular treat). There’s good booty work in the choreography by Darrell Grand Moultrie: never mind the hams, it’s all about the butts.

His birthday is belatedly being marked by Sony Classical with a repackaging (with all the original sleeve notes as well as new material) of the four albums that Riley recorded for the Columbia label in the 1960s and 70s and which made his name internationally. The first two of them contained what have remained his most celebrated works: In C was recorded in 1968 with a seven-piece ensemble overdubbed to create 25 instrumental voices in the final mix, and A Rainbow in Curved Air appeared the next year, with Riley himself playing a variety of keyboard instruments. After In C, Riley was signed up for a three-record deal that began with A Rainbow, but the following two discs have been less influential: Church of Anthrax was a 1971 collaboration between Riley and John Cale, while Shri Camel, another solo effort from Riley, dates from 1977 but was not released until 1980.View image in fullscreenTerry Riley: The Columbia RecordingsIf listening to these works again reinforces admiration for In C, even though some later recordings of what is now a seminal work are tauter and more incisive than this original, it suggests that nothing in Riley’s later works possess anything like the same originality and raw rigour. Even A Rainbow, with its layers of decorative improvisation, seems self-indulgent now, and nothing on the other two albums is any more impressive. The set is a reminder that the historical importance of Riley’s early music is undeniable, but how much of it deserves our attention now is more debatable.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicTerry Rileyalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

But now, it seems, Lim feels it is time to reveal a more expressive, intimate side to his playing, and indeed it’s hard to imagine anything more different from the Chopin and Rachmaninov than Tchaikovsky’s suite The Seasons.View image in fullscreenYunchan Lim: Tchaikovsky: The SeasonsBegun immediately after the premiere ofTchaikovsky’s first piano concerto and composed in parallel with his ballet Swan Lake, the series of 12 miniatures that make up The Seasons were commissioned by a magazine, and published monthly through 1876. They were intended to be played by amateurs, and the technical demands most of them make are modest. But their charm and lyric beauty have made them a popular part of many concert pianists’ repertory, whether as encore pieces or played as a selection in a recital.Each piece in the set has a descriptive title, appropriate to the time of year it illustrates: January is “By the Fireside”, March “Song of the Lark”, May “White Nights”, and so on. But in his sleeve notes, Lim offers his own provocative interpretation of the cycle. “Tchaikovsky’s The Seasons,” he claims, “depicts the final year in a person’s life.” What justification he might have for this assertion, apart from the composer’s generally jaundiced view of life, isn’t clear, and loading these often innocent miniatures with such a subtext seems wilfully obtuse. But perhaps Lim’s gloomy view of the work explains why his tempi for some of the pieces seem on the slow side, never quite to the point of sounding laboured, but certainly slow enough to give the music more gravitas than usual. Everything else about Lim’s playing is, as you would expect, exemplary, but several other pianists, most recently another major prize winner,Bruce Liu, present them in a less knowing, more guileless way.Is this 20-year-old the greatest pianist of our times?

She has just successfully argued in front of a court that a river running through the fictional version of the Indian city of Muziris should have the same rights as a person. According to Kuyili, this has precedent – after all, companies can argue in court similarly to individual people.The excitement over this historic win doesn’t last long as, soon after, the river is polluted by a large oil spill, which catches fire, the toxic smoke enveloping several neighbourhoods. Pollution on this scale has devastating effects, so Kuyili and her colleagues begin investigating.All Will Rise is effectively a deck-building game built around verbal sparring. In order to prepare for an important conversation, you first send Kuyili and her colleagues to different people in the community to gather information. Those trips net you cards, which you can then use as arguments. Claims cards can appeal to different emotions and each one has a different validity based on the information you have gathered. Saying that a corporation’s illegal waste disposal is responsible for the pollution of the river, for example, may get your opponent fired up, but if the card is mere speculation, as opposed to something you can back up with definitive proof, they may reject it.View image in fullscreenVerbal sparring … All Will Rise.Photograph: Speculative AgencyWhile it’s a lot to absorb at first, the card-based conversations aim to represent the many ways a conversation can go. While developer Speculative Agency cites courtroom comedy Ace Attorney as one of its inspirations, shouting “Objection!” will not necessarily get you what you want here.“Talking to people in All Will Rise is based on the idea that you often partner with another person when you’re having a conversation,” Speculative Agency’s co-founder and producer Niels Monshouwer says. “In Dutch we use the wordgesprekspartner, conversational partner, for the person you’re talking to, and conveying that feeling of partnering with someone was important to us.”In conversation and information gathering, characters expend emotional energy, a system based on what it can take out of you to engage in activism or simply keep up with the news. “Looking at the state of the world, we experience the same pain that everybody in their right mind is having,” says narrative director Meghna Jayanth. “But every time we meet, we feel empowered, stronger, happier. There are so many people out there trying to do the right thing. Don’t stay alone – organise, collaborate. This is where you will feel strong. We want the game to give people that feeling, and hopefully take that back out into the real world.”All Will Rise is not only set in India. Each chapter will shed light on the environmental challenges in a different part of the world and people’s efforts to counteract them. “We haven’t completely decided yet, but we are thinking about Puerto Rico, the Netherlands and maybe Nigeria,” says Monshouwer. “The first case deals more with pollution, corporate exploitation and local government corruption. But we’re also thinking about topics such as biodiversity loss, climate change and destruction of ocean floors due to mining.”View image in fullscreen‘Inappropriately joyful’ … All Will Rise.Photograph: Speculative AgencySpeculative Agency, which is planning a Kickstarter campaign to raise funding for the game, wants to include countries its developers are based in, which Monshouwer feels is crucial for tackling these subjects with authenticity. Another important driver for the studio is the work of its science and impact director, Joost Vervoort, who is an associate professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, working at the intersection of games and sustainability. Vervoort’s research group Anticiplay, has already explored how the climate crisis can be dealt with in games and is working to make sure All Will Rise can empower players with real-life facts around climate activism.The team has found that while the number of games tackling real-world issues is rising, there is still a lot of space for improvement. “In our first chat together we found that too many games that deal with climate change, pollution or other forms of societal collapse fall into two categories: green god games and toxic wasteland games,” says Monshouwer.“Toxic wasteland games are games where the collapse is a backdrop and the message is that there is no hope. Green god games put you into the shoes of an omnipotent being that decides where to put magic machines that clean up pollution. It oversimplifies the problem to a technical instead of a societal one, and nobody in the world has that much power. We wanted to make games about the process of change and what you can do as an individual within a community, instead of being the lone hero.”While the subjects that All Will Rise tackles are heavy, Jayanth says that it is a joyful game at its core. The team has even described the game as “inappropriately joyful” given, well, everything. “If we look around at the world right now, it would be easy to say it’s inappropriate to feel joy,” says Jayanth, who has long used her position in the gaming industry for activism. “But joy powers transformation. Rage does too, and we have plenty of that in the game as well. But we as a team feel like hope is the only useful political response to the challenges facing us all.”Ultimately, All Will Rise is meant to show that it’s never too late to get involved in activism, even though the challenge can feel daunting. “Our ideal reaction to the game would certainly be if someone went out and got involved,” Jayanth says. “There are many more types of activism than tying yourself down somewhere or joining a demonstration, and we hope people will feel inspired to give it a try.”All Will Wise is set for release on PC, date is to be confirmedExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsIndie gamesStrategy gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Businesses close and the city nearly grinds to a halt. Among those who remain, there is an eternal, quintessentially Parisian quest: hunting for a balmyterrassebathed in sunlight for an evening apéritif.Finding the perfect seat on the pavement outside a cafe may be a matter of a chance stroll or a timely text from a friend. This summer, though, a digital solution has gained popularity in an extremely French instance of the old Apple slogan “there’s an app for that”: Jveuxdusoleil, an app that tracks the sun’s movement through the city’s maze of buildings to pinpoint exactly where you can claim a sunny spot on a terrace for your coffee. It arrives at a precarious moment for this particularly Parisian pursuit.‘Own less, have more’: French app rents out underused household itemsRead moreJean-Charles Levenne created Jveuxdusoleil (“I want sun”) in 2020 as a side project in an effort to teach himself app development and solve a personal problem: finding shade during hot days as well as sunny spots for the Parisian ritual of post-work drinks.Using sun-positioning algorithms and building-height data from the open-source map platform OpenStreetMap, Levenne’s app displays sunny terraces, while darkened ones disappear. Users can also request new spots through the app or note when it is not accurate (a tree casting a previously unaccounted for shadow, for example), making it a constantly evolving, community-driven tool. While the technology is working in other cities, most of the terraces on the app are located in Paris, where Levenne says it is particularly useful.“This app is working worldwide but it has originally been focused on Paris because there is more need than in other French cities,” he said. “With narrow streets and tall buildings, it’s not always easy to find a sunny spot.”Terraces function as observation posts from which to view Paris – chairs are often positioned on either side of the small bistro tables, facing the street rather than each other and allowing diners to observe the world passing by. With France’s lack of tipping culture, there is less pressure to quickly turn over tables to make more profit. One could order a single cup of espresso for less than €2 and stay for hours – making the terrace something of a second living room for Parisians.Pierrick Bourgault, a photographer and journalist who has written about 20 books and releaseda documentaryabout bistro culture in France, said terraces in Paris offer one of the most authentic windows into the city.“The terrace is emblematic of a certainart de vivre[art of living], as we say in France – a place where all kinds of people meet,” Bourgault said. “You’re not alone in an enclosed space. It’s a bit like [being in] the street, with one foot inside and one foot outside. You’re immersed in the city, and the spectacle of life.”In search of sun after the darkest winter in decadesJveuxdusoleil’s user base has climbed steadily in the years since its launch – with more than 1,300 active users in the week preceding my interview with Levenne, who has departed the tech world and called me from a yacht he now captains in the Balearic islands off the coast of Spain. App usage spikes in the spring, when Parisians are desperate for sunlight after the notoriously dreary winter months.This year, Jveuxdusoleil saw a peak of almost 20,000 visitors in just one week in early March after France experienced thedarkest year in 30 yearsin 2024. Paris in particular enduredmultiple stretchesof nearly a week at a time without a single ray of sunshine during the winter months. Jveuxdusoleil is entirely a passion project, and Levenne makes no profit from it. “In fact, it costs me money to host the servers,” he said.A Paris-based photographer I spoke with, who uses the app both to find sunny streets for shooting and terraces to enjoy drinks with friends, said the uncomplicated nature of Jveuxdusoleil is part of its appeal. Its features are minimal: with just one slider that determines time and sunlight, it positions itself as a kind of anti-everything app.Can an app revive decliningterrasseculture?While usership of Jveuxdusoleil is not necessarily widespread – many young French people I spoke with on the terraces of Paris had never heard of the app – its existence indicates a technological embrace of bistro culture in France at a crucial time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The document also stated that in Paris the number of bistros has declined from 5,000-6,000 in the 1970s-80s to just over 1,000 today. A coalition of French bistro ownerssuccessfully securednational recognition in September 2024. They have similarlybeen campaigning since 2018for Unesco World Heritage status for their establishments.Bourgault attributes this “massacre”, which has decreased the density of bistros in France over the last century from one cafe per 100 inhabitants to one per 2,000, to a barrage of continuing threats. The rise of automobiles and highways has diverted traffic from such establishments across the country, while television, smartphones and digital communications have replaced the need to meet friends at the local terrace. The report by bistro owners likewise cites globalization and changing consumer preferences as risks to bistro culture.Unconventional dating app Feeld reports surge in ‘vanilla tourists’Read moreA 1941 law prohibits new cafe creation and only allows takeovers of existing licenses, keeping the number of bistros relatively stagnant while soaring real estate prices, particularly in Paris, have made both running and patronizing these establishments less financially viable. French commentators have long lamented the “Americanisation of Paris”, withsome notingthat, as more traditional bistros close, McDonald’s is spreading quickly across France and becoming a de facto meeting place for many young people.Bourgault said the rise of technology has contributed to the decline of bistros; people can order delivery on their phones, and when they do go out they often stay glued to their devices instead of chatting with strangers at thecomptoir. It’s ironic then, he noted, that an app could in fact strengthen the bistro culture of Paris.“With its geographical visualization, the app situates you in the concrete world – it reminds us that we’re on earth, it reminds us that there’s a sun that moves, the earth that turns,” he said.“When we meet friends at a bistro for a drink, we aren’t meeting in the cloud – we are meeting in a cafe with distinct personality, characters and decor,” he added. “We know we are not two artificial intelligences [in the process] of exchanging digital protocols. We talk to each other, and without a shadow of a doubt, we know it is real.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyFrance (World news)France (Weather)EuropeEurope holidaysnewsShareReuse this content"

People walk slowly between two dense hedges of windfallen oak branches, or stand silently in a fragile cage of bulrush stems with light seeping through the mossy skylight overhead. I’m visiting the largest ever indoor exhibition ofwork by Andy Goldsworthy, one of Britain’s most influential nature artists. His recent installations have a visceral sense of rural landscape: hare’s blood on paper, sheep shit on canvas, rusty barbed wire, stained wool, cracked clay.The show is a sensory celebration of earth – its textures and temperatures, colours, character. The seasons cycle through an ongoing multidecade series of photos featuring the same fallen elm. There are leaf patterns and delicate woven branches, crusts of snow, lines of summer foxglove flowers or autumn rosehips. Andy Goldsworthy: Fifty Years is a National Galleries of Scotland (NGS) exhibition in the neoclassical Royal Scottish Academy building.View image in fullscreenBarbara Hepworth’s Ascending Form (Gloria) at the Royal Botanic Garden.Photograph: Antonia ReeveAfter the exhibition, as a sort of cultural pilgrimage, I’m walkingsix miles across Edinburghin search of works by the Dumfriesshire-based Goldsworthy and other artists who engage with the landscape. I start at the Royal Botanic Garden (free and open daily,rbge.org.uk), a short bus ride north of the National Gallery. Just inside the east gate, there’s aperforated sculpture by Barbara Hepworthwith sunlight pouring through it.“Art has made me look at the world … and engage with what’s around me,” Goldsworthy writes in the notes for Fifty Years. Walking up through shady beeches, blazing wildflowers and scented, bee-buzzing lavender, there’s a bronze girl in a waterlily pond, and a sundial by the Scottish artist and writer Ian Hamilton Finlay near the terrace cafe. Finlay’s best-known artwork is the garden he created with his wife, Sue, in the wild Pentland Hills (£15 over-16s, £10 for 10-15s, under-10s free, open Thursday to Sunday until 28 September,littlesparta.org.uk). He also built a stone temple in the rolling, wooded acres ofJupiter Artland, a few miles from Edinburgh, where Goldsworthy has put rocks in trees and trees in a stone-walled barn (£11.80 adults, £7.50 children).

TheWater of Leith Walkwayruns close to the John Hope Gateway on Arboretum Place, and I follow it south-westwards. In Stockbridge, the Sunday market, shaded by whitebeam trees, offers loaves of artisanal bread, Perthshire strawberries andcakes made from insects. Almost hidden in branches under a bridge, a lifesize cast-iron figure stands in the river nearby, one ofAntony Gormley’s 6 Times statues.View image in fullscreenStone Coppice by Andy Goldsworthy at Jupiter Artland.Photograph: FocusCulture/AlamyAnother of the figures is buried chest-deep by the zebra crossing betweenNational Galleries Scotland: Modern One and Two. Wandering past domed St Bernard’s Well, with its statue of the goddess of health, and picturesque Dean Village, crammed with fellow camera-wielding visitors, I detour to the Modern galleries up the riverside steps. Linking both museums is Charles Jencks’ hugeLandform, with its grassy hills and curving pond. There are days’ worth of galleries, artists’ rooms and sculpture gardens to explore here, but the afternoon is passing and I have more miles and museums to cover.Heading back along the leafy Water of Leith, I climb another steep flight of steps towards Haymarket. On the south lawn ofSt Mary’s Episcopal Cathedral, a labyrinth winds through aromatic yarrow and knapweed. Around this flowering meadow, as part of an installation calledOn Sacred Ground, there are rough benches elegiacally listing threatened Scottish species: corncrake, hawfinch, wryneck, ring ouzel, capercaillie. I walk on throughPrinces Street Gardens, back past the Royal Academy building, and drop into theNational Gallery(free) next door to see Van Gogh’s impasto Olive Trees and William McTaggart’s stormy seascapes.View image in fullscreenOne of Antony Gormley’s 6 Times statues in the Water of Leith.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAUp more steps, pausing to look back at distant views of the firth, and then down again across photogenic Victoria Street. Finally, I stroll through Greyfriars Kirkyard to reach the National Museum of Scotland (free,nms.ac.uk). In 1998, Goldsworthy installed four sunset-coloured blocks of split sandstone on themuseum roof, with its panoramic city views. But the blue skies have turned stormy. “Our roof terrace is closed today – the weather is too dreich!” says a red sign by the lift.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among the crowds are buskers, jugglers, unicyclists. With just one night to sample its anarchic offerings, I plunge into dodgy cabarets and sweaty comedies in tiny underventilated venues. At 9pm, I’m back at the National Museum for an accomplished Lloyd-Webber-esquemusical about Van Gogh. Towards midnight, I head to Summerhall for a strange, polyphonicprequel to Hamletby the Polish choral-theatre group Song of the Goat.The next day, as I walk to Edinburgh’s Waverley station, there’s a prismatic haze caught between the misty drizzle and breezy summer sun. It reminds me of Goldsworthy’s 1980s photo series with titles likeRainbow Splash Hit Water With Heavy Stick Bright, Sunny, Windy. As the train speeds south, through Northumberland and North Yorkshire, I see with new eyes the wave-pounded cliffs and bale-studded headlands, the dry-stone walls and sheep-scattered patchwork dales.The trip wasprovided byVisit Scotland,NGSandLNER,(York to Edinburgh from £23 each way,London to Edinburgh from £52).

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve been asked about the “tinnification” of drinks pretty much everywhere else, so it feels only apt to talk about it here, too, because producers are putting just about everything they can in a can these days. Obviously, canned drinks aren’t anything new – the first canned beer went on sale in 1935, when post-prohibition America saw Krueger’s Finest Beer punted to drinkers in Virginia. Similar attempts had been made many years earlier, but it wasn’t until after two years of testing that the boffins finally developed a special coating that prevented the beer from reacting with the tin can.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And it’s not just beer that’s getting the aluminium treatment. Canned cocktails and canned wine are now going from strength to strength, too (and irrespective of whether you view the latter as a marvel of modern science or a vinous abomination) . Time was when only Provençal rosé and New Zealand sauvignon blanc got the tinned treatment, but now everything fromorange winetoEnglish sparklingis getting tinnified.The reasons for this are many, and all are inescapably tied to modern drinking habits. The Silicon Valley Bank’s 2025 state of the US wine industryreportrecorded a rise of29.3%in the uptake of so-called ready-to-drink (RTD) products, citing convenience and cost as two of the main factors for that increase. I mean, yeah, we’re all broke right now (although you don’t need me to tell you that – you need only look at the emergence of the £7 pint). And although we might end up drinking a bottle of tequila over the space of a couple of months, a £3 pre-mixed can is far more appealing to the wallet than a £30 bottle.It doesn’t just cost less; there’s less liquid, too. Well, obviously – but at least that means it’s easier to track how much you’ve had, particularly for RTD cocktails. And, for the mental and physical health-conscious drinker, it’s much easier to quantify the units in three cans of spritz than it is to eyeball a bottle of Campari to work out the same metric. There are many new brands that, effectively, have been launched to meet this purpose, but there are also plenty of existing brands that have pivoted to meet demand.But does tinnification affect the drinking experience, and does it affect the liquid itself? New Zealand wine producerVilla Maria, known for its supermarket sauvignon, started putting its stuff in cans a couple of months ago. They’ve kept dissolved oxygen levels below 0.5 parts per million to protect aroma and flavour, and they claim this was noticeable during a six-month comparative trial between canned and bottled wines.David Roper, the group’s winemaker, also notes the reduced ecological impact of cans over bottles, because they’re lighter, infinitely recyclable and have a lower carbon footprint than glass, so benefit both the producer and the consumer.

For most of my life, this arcing coastal stretch of East Anglia was somewhere I had never visited, nor ever spent that much time thinking about; a span of English countryside that I mostly associated withAlan Partridge, Colman’s mustard and, in the context of my south London home, an awkward schlep. But then, almost exactly a decade ago, I stumbled through an internet rabbit hole on to an entry for a clutch of self-catering cottages in a seaside village near the gently bougie, wax-jacketed market town of Holt. Decision made.Soon we were rumbling out across an impossibly wide and flat expanse, bound for the ripe, blustering winds and billowing steam trains of a varied network of time-warp beaches and little towns. Not expecting much, and yet falling a little more in love with each passing moment and meal, with each glistening fistful of perfect chips fromNo1 Cromeror a tea room crab roll after watching seals nose out of the water at Blakeney Point.The arrival of a second kid, pandemic lockdowns and juddering personal and professional life shifts – all of these significant markers across the past 10 years have been punctuated by repeat trips to this understatedly beautiful strip of once-alien coastline. And though we have seen this part of the world in many different modes, the phrase that best crystallises my associative excitement is this: samphire season. I had definitely eaten and enjoyed the spindly green sea vegetable before our north Norfolk years, but I don’t think it was until we visited in summer, when samphire is at its abundant, fleeting peak in the tidal mudflats that gird the shoreline, that I appreciated its connection to East Anglian culinary culture, or how special it is when sampled at the source. When summer hits, this briny, delicately beaded marsh grass (locally pronounced more like “sam-fer”) is a comforting ubiquity, lurking on restaurant blackboards, in fishmonger window displays and in the DIY honesty boxes that ornament the wending coastal roads. There is a core memory from a few years ago: sticky-fingered, sandy kids in the car, and my wife Madeleinerunning from the passenger side to procure one of the last paper bags of foraged samphire from a roadside table amid the marshy, glimmering swelter of a little village called Salthouse.An improvisatory hodge-podge back in the holiday cottage kitchen yielded butter-fried new potatoes and samphire, alongside vegetarian chorizo sausages: a deeply weird but extraordinarily effective combination in which the waxy starch and fatty, paprika spicing somehow both muffle and complement the salinity of those nobbled green tufts. In the intervening years, I have evolved and refined the pleasure of that moment into a loose recipe, with the helpful lubrication of a potato salad dressing and an optional lily-gilding of fatty fish.Chop 200g chorizo (vegetarian or vegan, if preferred) into hunks and roast in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 15-20 minutes, until cooked through and golden. Meanwhile, boil 500g good, skin-on small potatoes in a pan of scantly salted simmering water for about 10 minutes, or until they just slip off the tip of a knife, adding 150g samphire for the last two to three minutes of cooking. Drain, halve the potatoes, if need be, and leave to steam dry.Make a simple vinaigrette with three tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, a tablespoon of white-wine vinegar, a little salt and pepper (remember to hold back on the salt), a teaspoon of sugar for balance, and a generous, emulsifying dollop of dijon mustard, then dress the potatoes and samphire while they’re still warm. Separately, mix three or four generous tablespoons of very good mayonnaise (I like an elegant, faint cloaking, rather than something too gloopy; again, go vegan, if required) with three chopped spring onions, some chopped capers and cornichons, parsley and dill, then stir into the cooled veg. Serve with the contrasting warmth of the roast chorizo and, if it appeals and you’re not going plant-based, two fillets of fresh mackerel, fried for just two or three minutes on each side.Creaminess and smoky heat; succulent, marine crunch and herbal freshness. Samphire is an underrated vegetable lightly reframed, a celebration of precious high summer, of hyper-seasonality, and a reminder of how, against the odds, a British-Nigerian city boy fell hard for this sleepy stretch of Partridge country.Picky by Jimi Famurewa, is published by Hodder & Stoughton at £20.
