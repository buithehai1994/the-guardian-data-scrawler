Maykel Fernández is in Charlotte, in the US, while Cristian Cuadra remains in Havana,Cuba– for now. All Cubans, all raised on revolutionary ideals and educated in good state-run schools, they have become disillusioned with the cherished national narrative that Cuba is a country of revolution and resistance. Facing a lack of political openness and poor economic prospects, each of them made the same decision: to leave.They are not alone. After 68 years of partial sanctions and nearly64 years of total economic embargoby the US, independent demographic studies suggest that Cuba is going through the world’s fastest population decline and isprobably already below 8 million– a 25% drop in just four years, suggesting its population has shrunk by an average ofabout 820,000 people a year.There are a number of root causes for this exodus, but most experts agree that the blockade, decades of economic crisis, crumbling public services, political repression and widespread disillusionment with the revolution have merged to become a “polycrisis”.All young people want to leave – there’s almost no food and it’s hard to get anythingHatri Echazabal OrtaThe unrest further undermines Cuba at a time when the Trump administration isstepping up its offensive across Latin America, heavilyreinforcing US military deployment in the Caribbean, raiding Caracas tocapture the Venezuelan president, andstepping up threatsagainst the governments of Panama, Colombia and Cuba.According toresearch on Cubaby Juan Carlos Albizu-Campos Espiñeira, an economist and demographer at the Christian Centre for Reflection and Dialogue in Havana, and Dimitri Fazito de Almeida Rezende at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, the Caribbean nation’s population is nowhere near the government’s 2015 projection for last year – 11.3 million – and has even fallenbelow forecasts for 2050.View image in fullscreenAcross Havana, rubbish piles up in streets due to inadequate waste collection, fuelling protestsBetween 2022 and 2023 alone,researchers saw an 18%plunge in the population due to migration. The country has also recordedmore deaths than birthsfor five years running, with fertility rates stuckbelow population replacement levelssince 1978. Now,one in four Cubansis over the age of 60, worsening economic and social prospects.But the exodus of young people is the prime accelerator of this decline. Most of those who leave are aged between 15 and 59; 57% are women and 77% are of reproductive age. They finance their emigration through their own resources and family funds, using a worldwide network of contacts to navigate routes through Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia.‘I’m leaving. I won’t have children,’ say the young, revealing a survival strategy: they can’t have children because they’d starveJuan Carlos Albizu-CamposThere are no independent studies to show whether most Cubans would support foreign military intervention to overthrow the regime that has ruled the island since Fidel Castro and Che Guevara came to power on 1 January 1959. Yet, among those who have leftCuba, many still hope for some change in their homeland.Echazabal, 29, left Havana with her mother and partner during the Covid pandemic, first heading to Russia, which does not require visas for Cubans for stays of up to 90 days. When legal uncertainties mounted, she flew to Serbia, then made a fraught journey by sea and land – often on foot – through Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia, followed by Italy and France before finally reaching Spain.Legal residency remains an uphill battle, made tougher bySpain’s evolving asylum policies. But, despite a deep sense of loss, Echazabal cannot imagine returning to Cuba unless radical change comes. There, daily life is a struggle for basic goods, with failing infrastructure and unviable wages, she says.For young Cubans, emigration is an “almost universal aspiration” – rooted in persistent hardship and the search for greater opportunity. “From the moment we become aware and start working, all young people want to leave; there’s almost no food, and it’s very hard to get anything,” Echazabal says.View image in fullscreenThe former Ursuline convent and hospital in Havana.Cuba has recorded more deaths than births for five years runningAlbizu-Campos says this reality is widespread in what he calls a polycrisis. He observes a harsh “Malthusianismof poverty”, with families forgoing having children to avoid starvation. He considers the constant population decline irreversible, as the “push factors” of economic and political desperation overwhelm any pull to stay. Policy responses, he says, are failing – what he calls a “point of implosion”.Understanding the damage caused by the blockade to Cuba is very difficultJuan Carlos Alfonso Fraga“That erosion is also a response, an act of resistance. ‘I’m leaving. I won’t have children,’ say the young, revealing another survival strategy: they can’t have children because they would starve,” Albizu-Campos says.The authorities concede there is a reduced population but put the decline at 14%, which would still be the second-worst worldwide during the five-year period to 2025, behind only Ukraine – a country at war.Cuba’sNational Office of Statistics and Information(Onei) counted 9.75 million residents at the end of 2024, down 300,000 from 2023. Onei’s deputy director, Juan Carlos Alfonso Fraga, agrees there has been “a profound, very complicated demographic change”, but avoids the term crisis.View image in fullscreenFor young Cubans, emigration is an ‘almost universal aspiration’, according to one exileAlthough his country has faced criticism over thecredibility of its statistical data, he says that differences in methodologies – such as who counts as a resident and who counts as a visitor – account for most of the disparities. Cuba’s audits are approved by the UN, he says.Approximately 80% of care, especially for elderly people, is provided by women … If these women leave, who will care for them?Elaine Acosta González“There is no inconsistency. Cuba has a very solid statistical system,” says Alfonso Fraga. “It is not good for these people to estimate that we are 8 million, that something was overestimated, that mortality was hidden. That is not the case.”Alfonso Fraga attributes the “demographic challenges” tothe US embargo, which has battered Cuba’s finances and trade for more than 60 years.He compares this outflow to previous emigration crises such as theMariel boatliftin 1980, when about 125,000 Cubans left Cuba for the US, and therafter crisisof 1994. “Understanding the damage caused by the blockade to Cuba is very difficult,” he says.Elaine Acosta González, a sociologist at Florida International University and director ofCuido60 Observatory, has tracked Cuba’s demographic decline, focusing on ageing, migration and the “care crisis”. She says migration has drained the country of the women who most often care for older people.View image in fullscreenCuba is going through sharp economic decline, making it difficult to earn a livingView image in fullscreenCuba has an increasingly ageing population, with one in four people now over the age of 60View image in fullscreenExperts agree this crisis is worse than the ‘special period’ from 1991 to 1995 after the USSR fell“Approximately 80% of care, especially for elderly people, is provided by women in the family. If these women leave, who will care for them?” she asks, warning of the erosion of public services, which increases social vulnerability.“We are experiencing an ongoing deterioration in social welfare,” says Acosta, an exile herself since 1995.Disillusioned youthGovernment and independent experts agree: the economy is at the core of the issue. Cuba faces its gravest economic crisis since the 1959 revolution – worse than the “special period” between 1991 and 1995, after the fall of the Soviet Union.Official figures show Cuba’s GDPplunged 10.9%in 2020, mostly due to the Covid pandemic and shutdown of international tourism. A feeble recovery brought minor positive growth in 2021 and 2022 – 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively – but the island slipped back into recession in 2023–24. The UNEconomic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbeanforecast another1.5% declinefor 2025, putting Cuba alongside Haiti as the only countries in Latin America and the Caribbean in recession.Of Cuba’s 15 main economic sectors, 11 are in decline: the sugar industry (down by 68% in the five years to 2023), fishing (down 53%) and agriculture (down 52%) lead the list, followed by manufacturing (down 41%), mining, trade, electricity and gas, public administration and social security, social services, science and innovation and financial services. The decline in tourism means foreign exchange earnings have also fallen by 60%.View image in fullscreenThe UN has forecast a 1.5% economic decline in Cuba for 2025, putting the country alongside Haiti as the only Latin American and Caribbean countries in recessionIn Havana, poverty is increasingly inescapable. Countless unemployed residents pass the time by informally selling trinkets or offering small services to foreign visitors. Across the capital – as in other major cities – rubbish piles up in the streets due to inadequate waste collection, fuelling sporadic street protests.In the historic district of Old Havana, a jewel of Latin American colonial architecture, crumbling buildings occasionally collapse – a stark contrast to the luxury hotels the regime has erected to cater to tourists.Classic 1950s cars, long emblematic of the island, now share the roads with a few imported Mercedes and BMWs, symbols of the widening inequality favouring a small elite of entrepreneurs running state-approved “private” businesses.View image in fullscreenThe economy is starkly divided: tourists enjoy dollar-priced stores and better services, while locals face shortages and high pricesYouth disillusionment is evident everywhere, fuelling many young Cubans’ desire to emigrate. Cuadra, 23, graduated in mechanical engineering in Havana only to find that an engineer’s monthly salary – usually about 6,000 or 7,000 pesos (about £12-£14) – is not enough to cover his living expenses.Instead, using the last family asset – a Soviet-era car with a troublesome engine – Cuadra works as a driver for La Nave, Cuba’s equivalent to Uber. In just one day he is able to make three times his former monthly salary as an engineer.He is not alone: many graduates are swapping professional careers for any work that helps them save to leave. “If you have the opportunity, you leave – there’s no future here,” says Cuadra, who is working on an application for Spanish citizenship.“I don’t believe in the revolution – it’s not worth supporting something that doesn’t produce results,” he says.The ideals of Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, he argues, hold no weight for a new generation facing a starkly divided economy: tourists enjoy dollar-priced stores and better services, while locals contend with shortages and sky-high prices.View image in fullscreenClassic 1950s cars emblematic of the island now share the roads with imported Mercedes and BMWs of the wealthy eliteJuan Triana Cordoví, an economist at the University of Havana’s Centre for the Study of the Cuban Economy and author of the influentialContrapesos(Counterweight) column, points to both external and internal causes: US sanctions and a stagnant state-focused economic model.Cuba is enduring a sharp economic decline, low investment, a negative balance of payments, and a phenomenon of “hidden unemployment” – where people have no real reason to work – along with a substantial fall in industrial and agricultural output.Triana Cordoví decries the government’s heavy spending on tourism infrastructure, noting that over the past 10 years,35% of total investmenthas been directed to the construction of “hotels and restaurants” and “real estate and rental activities”, while agriculture, food and energy production have been neglected.Graph of decline in Cuba’s agricultural productionHe links the population decline to a brain drain, saying the exodus has emptied classrooms and created shortages of key personnel in hospitals and rural areas. The loss of highly trained professionals has a huge impact, he says. “When you lose an engineer, you lose 22 years of investment. It’s very difficult to recover from that.”Helen Yaffe, a senior lecturer at Glasgow University who has lived on the island and has family there, argues that Cuba’s current crisis can only be understood within the context of decades of US strategy designed to induce economic hardship and “provoke disenchantment and disaffection”, as laid out in the1960 Lester Mallory memo– a document widely regarded as the blueprint for the US economic embargo.View image in fullscreenCuba has been under partial or total US sanctions for 68 yearsThese 68 years of sanctions – themost enduring trade embargoin modern history – have deprived Cuba of credit and blocked partnerships with international lenders, while historical allies such as Russia and China no longer offer unlimited financial support due to the island’s crushing public debt (108.6% of GDP) and deficit (about 17% at its peak), as well as its record of defaults on loan repayments.“It would be almost unbelievable if Cuba didn’t have these crises,” says Yaffe, who hosts theCuba Analysis podcast. “On the one hand, the blockade creates economic suffering and crises, which then generate emigration, intensifying the demographic crisis.”Graph showing halving of agricultural production in CubaDespite impressive scientific breakthroughs, including advancedAlzheimer’s researchand ahomegrown Covid-19 vaccine, Cubalacks basic medical supplies, due to the embargoand the economic crisis. Yaffe says the migration-fuelled loss of human capital in healthcare and education is eroding the backbone of Cuba’s social system.Teams working on development and poverty reduction issues warn that rationed wages, persistent blackouts – up to 22 hours a day in the second-largest city, Santiago de Cuba – and reliance on imports have battered public health, education and transport. Cuba dropped to97th in the 2025 UN’s human development index, from57th in 1990.View image in fullscreenCuba produces less than 50% of the electricity it needs and power cuts are frequentView image in fullscreenAgriculture and food production are in declineView image in fullscreenCriticism is now more open and frequent, against both the government and the revolutionThe baseline for public services was once high, but hospitals and schools are now shadows of their former selves. An economist working in the humanitarian sector says: “For us, the collapse is happening, even though we still have better services than in Central America, for example. The system still exists, but there are no longer resources to make it work.”Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior foreign diplomat points to the country’s economic decline, the crisis in the welfare system and the energy deficit, noting that the country produces less than 50% of the electricity it needs. “The collapse has already happened,” he says.Graph of population change in CubaThese factors mean that despite Cuba’s minuscule0.1% share of global cumulative carbon emissions, it faces the risk of a humanitarian disaster due to the climate crisis. Extreme weather events are increasing; Hurricane Melissa, which struck in October, affected more than3 million Cubans.“At any moment,” an urban planner warns, “the country could fall into an even deeper crisis, which could come from another crisis, such as a hurricane or something else.”View image in fullscreenA parade to celebrate 100 years since the birth of Cuba’s revolutionary leader, Fidel Castro, at the University of Havana in November. Raúl Castro (on the banner to right), took over as Cuba’s leader from his brother Fidel (left), but has now retiredDressed in military uniform, following the old Castro tradition, President Miguel Díaz-Canel recently made statements on television praising the civil defence’s response to the damage caused by the hurricane – enraging many Cubans, who are still struggling without power and facingepidemicsofZika virus,dengueandchikungunya.Despite the evidence, the government denies the risk of a humanitarian crisis. Onei’s Alfonso Fraga says Cuba ranks well in the UN’s multidimensional poverty index, which evaluates income, nutrition, living standards and access to services. Themost recent reportshows that just 0.1% of Cuba’s population endures severe poverty.Impasse andunrestIn Havana, it is not easy to find people openly advocating for American intervention in the country. Yet many are calling for change.Dr Mayra Espina, a researcher at Havana’s Christian Centre for Reflection and Dialogue, calls the crisis structural and systemic. The US embargo, Cuba’s label as a sponsor of terrorism and missteps by Díaz-Canel following Raúl Castro’s retirement – such as failing to carry out reforms that would open up the country’s economy – have all deepened poverty and inequality, she says.Internal policies and underinvestment have made living and working in rural areas less attractive than in cities, fuelling migration from the countryside and leaving agriculture and food production in decline.View image in fullscreenCubans blame the government for power outages, fuel shortages and the poor state of transport and education“We are now at a point of no return, as the solution is not to restore previous policies,” Espina says, warning that only significant changes can rebalance the country. “Will they be made? Can they be made peacefully? I don’t know. The situation also involves many risks of violent upheaval.”Espina says the pandemic hit Cuba very hard, increasing inequality and food insecurity among a growing number of women, and black and mixed-race people.Cubans’ frustration is sharpest when it comes to healthcare. Once a source of enormous national pride and a model for the region, the system is now buckling under relentless epidemics, worsened by severe shortages of supplies and medical staff.Most Cubans want change. But you cannot lead opposition inside Cuba because the regime jails any potential organiserJosé Daniel Ferrer GarcíaHowever, despite living under a dictatorship, criticism is now more open and frequent, not just against the government’s failure to deal with chronic power outages, fuel shortages and the dire state of transport and education, but also about the 67 years of “revolution”.Some see the regime’s complete collapse as inevitable, while others believe reforms within the only party, the Cuban Communist party (PCC), might save the system.Carlos Alzugaray, former head of the Cuban mission to the European Union and member of the PCC, acknowledges the challenges the regime encounters in reforming itself.“They do not know how to design policies to address a reality they do not understand well,” he says, adding that those who want reform face internal opposition from those who are afraid of losing their status. “Many are stuck in a Soviet socialist model that has failed.”Graph of projected GDP changes in Latin American and Caribbean countriesWhile some believe in reform, others want an end to the communist system.On 11 July 2021, thousands of people took to the streets to protest, in what became known as 11J, urging change as the pandemic and economic collapse converged. Díaz-Canel’s government cracked down, delaying reforms and arresting hundreds.Human Rights Watch reportsthat at least 700 people have been imprisoned since the 11J protests, the largest since the Cuban revolution. They face lengthy sentences amid reports of torture, poor conditions and denial of medical care. Despite the “polycrises”, even dissidents acknowledge that the state’s social control apparatus remains robust and vigilant, cracking down on any opposition,detaining possibly thousands of political prisoners.View image in fullscreenThe most enduring trade embargo in modern history has deprived Cuba of credit and blocked partnerships with international lendersOne of Cuba’s most prominent former political prisoners, José Daniel Ferrer García, the founder of the opposition groupPatriotic Union of Cuba(UNPACU), went into exile in Miami in October after decades of activism and multiple imprisonments.He continues to warn of potential humanitarian disaster, especially in eastern Cuba, where poverty is dire. Ferrer says emigration not only empties offices and hospitals but also weakens the opposition movement at home.“Most Cubans, inside and outside, want change,” he says. “But you cannot lead opposition inside Cuba because the regime jails any potential organiser immediately.”Another exiled political dissident, Luis Leonel León, Miami-based director of the Cuban Studies Institute, argues that forced exile has always been the regime’s fix – sending generations abroad and giving rise to what he calls the “empty island”. For many, he says, hope is so diminished that even rebelling seems pointless; the best option is to leave rather than fight.View image in fullscreenThe exodus has created a brain drain that has left the education system damaged“In Cuba, people have lost hope. And when you have no hope, you lose the will to live, to do anything, even to rebel,” says León, who believes that while these overlapping crises have created the conditions for regime change, repression and fear are stifling action.Ferrer agrees, saying that although the country is ripe for rupture, fear drives most Cubans to leave rather than resist. León contends that only a vibrant diaspora, with outside support, such as Trump’s backing for the overthrow of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, plus internal fractures in the regime, could bring about regime change.Graph of performance of Cuba’s economic sectorAlso referring to Maduro, Ferrer says: “Advocates of supposed legalistic purity invoke the ‘rules-based international order’. But those rules have been systematically violated by the dictatorships that are now tearing their hair out.”Ricardo Zúñiga, who was Barack Obama’s principal adviser for the Americas and a key US negotiatorduring the 2014 thawbetween the two countries, doubts that demographic collapse alone would trigger the immediate change that analysts predict. He recalls a fleeting burst of hope as diplomatic ties with Havana were restored, but says the reversal of reforms by both sides disappointed millions.View image in fullscreenExperts suggest the US’s strategies should aim to improve Cubans’ daily lives, not merely seek regime changeThe abrasive foreign policy of theTrump administrationhave accelerated the outflow of people, draining the country of its most productive age group and killing hopes for reform.Zúñiga says the US strategy should aim to improve Cubans’ daily lives, not merely seek regime change. “Worsening conditions have never brought change, regardless of whether sanctions are justified,” he says.“I believe the popular opposition to [the regime] is quite strong at this point. But people have been predicting ‘next year’ in Havana for a very long time,” he says.“As long as elites in Havana believe that they will fare worse in a period of change than better, then I don’t see them initiating any sort of palace coup, or adaptation, or movement. And I think that there’s no sign of that.”Yaffe observes a decline in enthusiasm for the revolutionary ideals of 1959, but insists that, despite real frustration, many Cubans still seek improvement within the system, rather than its revolutionary overthrow.View image in fullscreenExperts say demographic collapse alone is unlikely to trigger immediate changeThe man chosen by the regime to comment on the country’s political situation, Guillermo Suárez Borges, a political scientist at Havana’sCentre for International Policy Research, acknowledges the impact of the US embargo in draining the state budget, deterring investment and pushing Cuba to the brink.Risking it all: migrants brave Darién Gap in pursuit of the American dreamRead moreYet he maintains that resilience is ingrained. “Was Cuba at a breaking point after the Soviet collapse? After the socialist bloc vanished?” he asks. “History will tell; people continue to resist.”Seeing no prospect of the regime’s imminent collapse, Fernández, 35, left Cuba after the 11J protests. During the pandemic, he travelled to Russia in his first attempt to emigrate. From there, he returned to Cuba and tried again, this time flying to Nicaragua, then overland through Honduras and Guatemala to Mexico, on a dangerous route through Central America.From Mexico, he made it to the US, where he now lives. Free from the threat of censorship and repression, Fernández says he can now testify, without fear, to the motivations, struggles and hopes of his generation of Cuban emigrants – often marked by disillusionment, economic hardship and political repression.View image in fullscreenLife is difficult for young people in Cuba as finding work that pays enough to live is challengingFernández says the 11J protests made his generation’s discontent and the severity of repression clear. For him, leaving the country is not necessarily a political act, but simply a bid for freedom, dignity and a better life.“It’s not like the exile of the 1980s and 1990s – that cruder exile. The youth just want to escape from a system, escape from socialism,” he says. “Young people don’t necessarily care much about what is happening in Cuba.”He contends that the return of Cubans such as him will only be possible with the fall of communism and the creation of what he calls a “true democracy”.“I’d ratherICE[immigration enforcement agents] pick me up on a street corner of the US and send me … to any country,” says Fernández. “I say sincerely, from the bottom of my heart: return to Cuba?

But a bit more character development or emotional investment wouldn’t go amissLucy ManganSat 10 Jan 2026 18.05 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 18.08 ESTShareI suspect that Chala Hunter is still on a recuperative retreat somewhere. Until about May, I would think. For she was the intimacy coordinator on Heated Rivalry and she has earned a break.For those not aware: intimacy coordinators gained prominence in the aftermath of the #MeToo movement, when assorted testimonies from actors (largely female) made public and unignorable the shocking fact that actors (largely male) and directors (largely male) will often (largely always) try to get away with more than has been contracted for once they are naked with A N Other person. An intimacy coordinator is there to help arrange scenes and advocate for actors. Think of them as somewhere between a bureaucrat and a contraceptive.Second of all, Heated Rivalry has a lot of sex in it. Specifically, sex between men. Even more specifically, sex between young men who are ice hockey stars and bitter rivals on the rink but irresistibly drawn to each other off it. They are Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams), a golden child whose talent has been nurtured by fond parents from the get-go and whose mother is his manager, signing him up for more lucrative brand deals and commercial shoots every time he sits down for a rest; and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie), a product of the more brutal Soviet system, whose mother is gone, whose father drives his son relentlessly for the glory of Russia and whose brother is a feckless waster, sponging off his sibling while also despising him for being gay.But in any romance – and however explicitly decorated, this is what Heated Rivalry remains, like the Game Changers books by Rachel Reid on which it is based – opposites attract and soon Shane and Ilya are at it like knives. Knives with fancy hotel rooms, perfect bottoms and legs and pieces of furniture perfectly placed at all times to obscure anything that would prevent the sale of Heated Rivalry to international markets.View image in fullscreenHudson Williams as ice hockey star Shane Hollander.Photograph: Sphere Abacus/SkyTheir first time is Shane’s first time with a man. For Ilya it is “really not”. Fortunately, Shane gets the hang of things pretty quickly and Ilya is a talented teacher, dedicated to increasing his student’s skill set over many more nights in many more fancy hotel rooms and, as their wealth and status increases over the years, apartments and architect-designed cabins as their secret relationship continues.After a while, however, watching people have sex – however perfect their bottoms – is undeniably tedious. And watching young men banter in between times (“You’re boring” says Ilya, repeatedly. “You’re an asshole,” Shane generally replies) even more so. And though the hockey scenes are kept to a minimum, they are also far from fascinating.Just when you are beginning to think “I would forsake some of Hunter’s hard work here in favour of just a little character development or emotional investment”, a second relationship is introduced that provides just that. Shane’s teammate Scott Hunter (François Arnaud) turns out to also be a closeted ice hockey player and episode three is devoted to the beginning of what turns out to be a life-changing and life-enhancing (by this stage for all of us) relationship with a lovely man called Kip (Robbie GK). It gives us something to hang on to while we wait for the main pair to grow up.The second half of the show lets them, a bit. Sex becomes love (and sex) and intimacy (and sex) and the banter improves a bit. Whether it is reward enough for sitting through the first few hours is for you to decide. Heated Rivalry has been a massive word-of-mouth hit (the creator and director Jacob Tierney has referred to its “baked-in” audience as “wine moms” which I do not have enough time or space to unpack here) since it was first released last year, so we will have to assume that for enough people, it certainly was.There has been praise for showing young men in love and in flagrante, and there has been criticism for not showing them, a la Russell T Davies’ masterwork Queer as Folk, more realistically in love and in flagrante, though the latter I think is to misunderstand the romance genre Tierney’s show sits in. I think the problem lies more in the fact that once you move past the relative novelty of the sex being shown on a mainstream series, there is only just enough of all the other stuff you need to make a good, rewarding story there. Maybe wine moms are too drunk to care? But – and I’m thinking of all those about to be caught up in the inevitable slew of copycat dramas to come – both actors and viewers deserve more.Heated Rivalry aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now in the UK, and on HBO Max in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

I was a street performer for years, so I know how to talk to an audience, which is what they were doing in Shakespeare’s time; they were performingtothe people, not at them. Actors got into this fourth-wall thing in the 1800s, it wasn’t there in Elizabethan times. Actors go, “Oh, da da da da” and they look up to the skies – whereas I will talk to the audience and bring them in. They are part of my brain, they are part of Hamlet’s brain.What is your most unpopular pop culture opinion?I think George Lazenby did a good job as James Bond. Some people think he didn’t, but I think On Her Majesty’s Secret Service really works. Telly Savalas and Diana Rigg did a great job, and the whole bloody thing is great. It’s the first one I ever saw, with my brother on a school trip, and I loved it. I’ve loved Bond ever since. “It’s all right, she’s having a rest” – what a tragic ending. It’s a beautiful film. It’s unfortunate Lazenby didn’t do more, but that was a good one.You have been performing new spins on some of your best-loved standup routines on the Remix tour. Are you surprised which of your routines have stayed in people’s minds?When some took off, yes – I could never quite tell what they would be. The Death Star canteen is the one that has stayed the longest. On the Remix tour I have done a spin on it – so just like Madonna did a remix of Like A Virgin and turned it into a German torch song and slowed the beat right down, I can do my story of Darth Vader having blown up the planet Alderaan and deciding to go celebrate down in the Death Star’s cafeteria. There’s a woman behind the counter who keeps saying, “You need a tray.” And he says, “I do not need a tray, do you know who I am?” He’s playing status games with her and she’s just saying, “Just get a tray!”Everyone knows that routine now. But as I said to the Monty Python guys when they were performing live – I said to John Cleese, “Don’t worry if you go wrong, because people love it because they’ve seen it right so many times.” So I’m deliberately making it go wrong – Daphne du Maurier now turns up in the Death Star canteen and she’s going to do a sequel to The Birds.I think aboutEvil Giraffequite a lot.Evil Giraffe is fun. That is weird. The first time I moved as a giraffe, people loved that. The idea was, could you get an evil giraffe? What would that look like? Would they eat more leaves than they should eat? I like the idea of a giraffe with a pencil-thin moustache.You’ve run more than 100 marathons. Which one was the hardest?The marathons I ran on the treadmillwere really tricky. Don’t try it – there’s nothing to look at! But the hardest one, and people should know this if they do marathon running, was when I was in Northern Ireland, where I used to live when I was a child. I ran from where I used to live in Bangor, near Belfast. And on the west side of Belfast it gets quite hilly, it goes up and up and up. I thought, if I get to the top of the hill, I should be finished. So I got up there and I could see how far I’d run and I was in a pretty good place. Then I realised I’d miscalculated – I actually had another six miles to go. When you think you’ve finished, six miles becomes really gruelling.There was also the double marathon I did in South Africa, where I ran 27 marathons in 27 days. I spent one day in hospital, so I did a double marathon on the last day to make up for it. I ended up doing 90km in just under 12 hours. That was a tough day.View image in fullscreenIzzard during the 2016 Sport Relief challenge in South Africa when she ran 27 marathons in 27 days.Photograph: Comic Relief/Getty ImagesWhat are you secretly really good at?Sword fighting. In Hamlet I have a sword fight against myself, so no one knows that I can actually do it very well. But I was a sword fighter in Covent Garden for a couple of years, so I do know what I’m doing.We like to ask about people’s biggest fashion crimes, but you wore some amazing outfits in your specials – do you still have them?A lot of them are in storage. There were some great Gaultier pieces. There’s one I wore on stage in Definite Article – it was orange and had good shoulders. On press night, a button fell off and everyone heard it. I found it and someone in a box threw down a sewing kit they’d taken from their hotel on to the stage, which was very funny. So I decided to sew the button on in real time, while doing my show. I thought, “I’ve committed to this now – I have to make sure I get it on.” That coat still exists and you can see where I sewed it on.What’s been your biggest onstage disaster?Once the theatre flooded and all the lights went out, so I had just one light on a stand on stage. I said, “Let’s just do ghost stories!” and I tried to make up my own ghost stories while they were trying to fix the lights. That was a big mistake.Another time, I was in South Africa and all the lights went crazy. I made them switch them off and got my phone out and switched on the phone light and did another ghost story – that seems to be my way of getting out of disaster.In Hannibal, there is a scene where Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen) makes your character, Abel Gideon, eat snails that have been feeding on his severed body parts. What did you actually eat in that scene?Eddie Izzard: ‘Why wouldn’t you take me seriously, given everything I’ve done in my life?’Read moreThey made me some mushrooms that looked like snails. It’s quite a scene! I decided to stab at them with this long pronged fork and in one of the takes the fork tumbled off the table to the floor, which is the one they used – I thought that was interesting. I loved that scene, sparring with Mads. It was a very scary show but making it was not scary. We filmed it in Toronto and at the timethe mayor of Toronto had been filmed taking crack cocaine. So we’d be on set saying, “Have you seen that? God that’s terrible. Anyway, when you slice into the body …” Everything we were doing was completely horrible!What’s been your most cringeworthy run-in with another celebrity?You know, they’ve all been pretty good! This is the opposite of cringeworthy. I was at the opening of Ocean’s 13 in Los Angeles. I’m in Oceans 13 for barely a couple of scenes but I went to the red carpet thing. I wasn’t talking to people, because you can’t barge your way in and say [grandly], “Yes, yes, let me tell you about things!” when I’m just a small supporting role. So I was standing at the back whenBrad Pittcomes shooting through. Brad was going through a relationship thing at the time and did not want to do the red carpet, so he just moved through at a very fast pace and plopped himself next to me. So we’re just hanging out, having a chat. Someone came over and said, “There’s a group photo Brad, you have to do it.” So he says, “You’re coming too!” And he dragged me into the group photo. So that was nice.Do you have a nemesis?No, but I will say I wasn’t very into Margaret Thatcher’s politics and, when her career stopped, mine started really taking off. I don’t think it was linked but it did seem to go in the same way. Her politics were not mine; she wasn’t into people.Izzard’s Hamlet is at the Sydney Opera House9 to 21 June, then Arts Centre Melbourne 30 June to 12 July.

But some analysts believe that Venezuela, home to the world’s largest proven reserves, could be pumping millions of additional barrels as early as this year, hitting the global price and squeezing Russia’s income.US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoillast year and a rise in the rouble, depressing income from oil sales in dollars, have already reduced receipts for Moscow.Optimists argue that after four years of war inUkraine, Putin is increasingly vulnerable because Russia’s financial position is precarious. A fall in oil prices, they say, would have a catastrophic effect on his ability to fund the war and continue grinding down Ukrainian resistance.They portray the Russian economy as a house of cards, ready to collapse if only the right gust of economic pressure could be directed at Moscow.8:31Why has Trump seized a Russian-linked oil tanker? | The LatestEconomic growth, spurred by government military spending, has slowed to almost zero after the Kremlin sought to calm the inflation caused by that same economic expansion. The International Monetary Fundpredicted growth of 0.6% in 2025and 1% in 2026.Interest rates are high at almost 20% and taxes are due to rise again this year. Unemployment has fallen to almost 2%, reflecting a severe labour shortage as young men are drafted into the army amid falling birthrates and an exodus of middle-income families to the west.Household incomes, which have grown in response to higher welfare spending, are now expected to stagnate. A paper by Marek Dabrowski, an analyst at the Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel, says the latest budget cuts have transferred from Moscow to the regions and reduced pension spending, with education also facing cuts. Business leaders complain there is little incentive to invest in such an environment.Some point to Iran, where a combination of sanctions and targeted military strikes has brought the economy to its knees, leading to food shortages and riots that threaten to topple the authoritarian regime.Could the same fate await Russia if sanctions are tightened and oil prices fall, forcing Putin to retreat behind the old borders while he attempts to quell internal strife?Last month, a group of economists gathered at the Brookings Institution in Washington to explore how tougher and more dynamic sanctions could further damage Russia’s war effort.Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Moscow has bought ahuge secondhand fleet of more than 400 vesselsto ship oil to Turkey, India and ahost of other countries. That “shadow fleet” has shrunk since 2024 to about half its former capacity, forcing Russia to rely on European-insured vessels to ship its oil.If European financial centres – London chief among them – were to take a tougher line on what they insure, Russian oil revenues could be severely hit.Yet this analysis ignores the successful rewiring of the economy by Putin’s administration, which has proved more adept in its handling of domestic politics and the government’s finances than it did the military in the first three years of the war.Russia can, and should, be hurt financially by further sanctions. But European leaders and Ukraine’s valuable allies in the US Congress, who have done so much to prevent Trump from siding wholeheartedly with his kindred spirit Putin, should not delude themselves into thinking that the Russian economy is on the brink of collapse.While economic growth has slowed to a near standstill, the broader strategy resembles a medically induced coma – designed to insulate the patient from unwanted outside interference.As optimists note, much of the government’s reserves are spent and oil revenues have fallen from 50% of state income to 25%. Yet Putin has found internal resources to fill the void, chiefly through higher taxes on households and businesses.Richard Connolly, at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, says: “The Kremlin has succeeded in selling the war, not as a battle with its near neighbour – its brothers and sisters in Ukraine – but as a war with the west.”On the impact of sanctions so far, he adds: “We are not near the economy being a decisive factor in the Kremlin’s thinking about how to pursue the war.”Russia’s debt-to-GDP ratio is just below 20%, while the annual spending deficit is about to hit 3.5% – modest by international standards, particularly when compared with the UK’s 11% deficit in the year Covid hit and a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 95%.Inflation soared after the invasion but has since been tamed, falling towards 6%, only modestly higher than the central bank target of 4%.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, in Delhi last month. India is turning away under a tougher sanctions regime.Photograph: Grigory Sysoev/ReutersThere is little doubt that Putin is turning the Russian economy into a junkyard, full of ageing and increasingly dysfunctional factories. He is milking it to aid the war effort without a care for the long-term consequences. But in the short term – this year and perhaps next – he can continue to fund the conflict without fearing economic collapse.China remains a friend and buyer of oil, while North Korea supplies people and kit, even if India and other beneficiaries of trade with Russia turn away under a tougher sanctions regime.Ukraine, meanwhile, has the money to continue for between 18 months and two years after the promise of €90bn from the EU. Putin, for his part, has the reserves to keep paying young men and their families to fight on.On Friday, Russialaunched hypersonic Oreshnik missilesat western Ukraine in a stark escalation of the conflict. The message for Europe is clear: it must help Ukraine push back harder militarily, ignoring Putin’s empty nuclear threats, while tightening the tourniquet on Russian trade.Four years of weak sanctions gave Putin time to reorganise. A tougher stance on trade may not trigger an economic collapse but Europe needs to work every angle to bring the war to an end.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsViewpoint columnVladimir PutinUkraineRussiaEuropeVenezuelaTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

He claimed his government was “in charge” ofVenezuelaand that US companies were poised to extract the country’s oil wealth.Clearly giddy with the success of the operation, achieved without a single US fatality but several Venezuelan and Cuban ones, Trump then served notice on a string of other nations that could face the same fate. “Cuba is ready to fall,” he said. Colombia was run by a “sick man” who was selling cocaine to the US but who would not “be doing it for very long”.View image in fullscreenTrump speaking to reporters on Air Force One the day after the seizure of Nicolás Maduro.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersTrump said he would postpone for 20 days to two months any discussions about his desired takeover of Greenland, the semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, a Nato ally, but made clear he was determined to seize it for the sake of US “national security”.New imperialismLest there was any doubt about the scale of Trump’s territorial ambitions, his administration posted its message to the world in capital letters, some of them red, on social media.“This is OUR hemisphere,” thestate department declaredon X above a black and white picture of Trump looking grimly determined.The White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, went on CNN to provide the rationale for Trump’s new approach to foreign policy.“We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time,” he said.Miller is one of the few aides to have served in high positions in both the first and second Trump tenures. He has emerged as chief ideologue, channelling the impulses of the president and packaging them as policy. In a social media post on Monday, Miller addressed the bigger picture and argued it was time for the west to stop apologising for its imperialist past.“Not long after World War II the West dissolved its empires and colonies and began sending colossal sums of taxpayer-funded aid to these former territories (despite have [sic] already made them far wealthier and more successful),”Miller wrote.“The neoliberal experiment, at its core, has been a long self-punishment of the places and peoples that built the modern world.”The US has invaded a long list of countries and changed regimes many times over the past few decades, but this is the first time it has done so since the second world war as a self-proclaimed exercise in imperialism. The extraordinary change in rhetoric coming from Washington means all three of the world’s military superpowers are overtly pursuing revanchist aims, the recovery of lost imperial greatness.View image in fullscreenSan Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, which is one of five territories under US sovereignty.Photograph: trekandshoot/AlamyVladimir Putin has taken on the mantle of Peter and Catherine the Great in restoring historical Russian lands, at the cost so far of a million Russian troops killed or injured in Ukraine, according to the British Ministry of Defence, the culmination of a string of conquests in Chechnya and Georgia.Xi Jinping has dedicated himself to China’s “great rejuvenation”, which includes recovering the territorial expanse of the Qing empire at its high-water mark before the “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign powers from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Beijing’s projection of force withmilitary bases around the South China Seadraws from that rationale, but Xi has repeatedly made clear the mission will not be completed until Taiwan is back under Beijing’s rule.Like the other two ageing autocrats, Trump’s vision for his country harks back to a bygone imperial past. His favourite president isWilliam McKinley, who led the US through a surge of territorial expansion at the end of the 19th century, including the military takeover of Cuba and the annexation of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines and American Samoa.Trump has also looked to the early 19th century for inspiration for his new bout of territorial acquisitiveness, in the form of the Monroe doctrine.View image in fullscreenJames Monroe, the fifth US president.Photograph: Getty Images“It was very important, but we forgot about it. We don’t forget about it any more,” the president said on Saturday.The reference not only reflected a view of the past uncomplicated by any detailed reading on Trump’s part, but also the changing relationship between the US and the notion of empire.The country was founded as a rejection of British imperialism and when President James Monroe developed his doctrine in 1823, setting out the leading US role in theAmericas, it was to act as a barrier to any further European colonialism.The version of the doctrine that Trump appears to embrace, however, is its repurposing by Teddy Roosevelt in 1904 at the height of a US exercise in traditional imperialism. Under the “Roosevelt corollary”, the US took on the role of “police power” which would intervene in any country in the region where it perceived there to be “flagrant cases of wrongdoing or impotence”.In itsnational security strategy documentpublished in November, a blueprint for the expansionism of early 2026, the White House laid out a “Trump corollary” to the Monroe doctrine “to restore American pre-eminence in the western hemisphere”.Trump calls it the “Donroe doctrine”, copying a New York Post front page from a year earlier. The difference from previous versions, he boasted characteristically, was that it would be bigger and better.The original Monroe doctrine was “a big deal”, he said, but added: “We’ve superseded it by a lot, by a real lot.”For all the febrile talk of doctrine and the sharp swerve in rhetoric coming from the White House, it is far from clear how it intends to proceed in Venezuela.New president, old policy?There appears to be disagreement within the administration – to the extent there is detailed discussion at all – on how to turn the president’s self-image of hemispheric emperor into a plan of action. Until that happens, what Trump has done in Venezuela is arguably not out of line with what the US has done around the world, but particularly in the Americas, when it was supposed to be abiding by the post-1945 “rules-based order”.Some argue that, as seen from the global south, US imperialism has remained a constant, and that all Trump has done is to drop the mask of hypocrisy.“The idea that this is new is ridiculous,” said Kehinde Andrews, a professor of black studies at Birmingham City University in the UK and the author of The New Age of Empire: How Racism and Colonialism Still Rule the World. “The US has been doing this all along, but the only difference here is it’s just brazen. There’s nothing new about this at all. This is what the west does; Trump’s just honest about it. I actually find it refreshing to be honest.”Andrews added that if Trump carried out his threat to seize Greenland, directing his imperialist appetites towards another western state and thereby crippling Nato, it would mark a significant break with the past. But for that same reason, he doubted it would happen.“If it was a black or brown place, it would have happened already,” Andrews said.View image in fullscreenHouses on the coast of a sea inlet in Nuuk, Greenland.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APDaniel Immerwahr, a historian and humanities professor at Northwestern University in Illinois, and the author of How to Hide an Empire, agreed that “the US empire never really ended”.He pointed out that the US still owns five permanently inhabited territories – Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa – and maintains 750 military bases around the world.On the other hand, Immerwahr argued that, for all the US hypocrisy and double standards under the “rule-based international order”, it remained markedly different to the imperial era.“The notion that as the US got more powerful it would grow larger – that was largely broken by the end of world war two,” Immerwahr said. While the liberal international order did not stop invasions and wars, “it is also true that the post-1945 era has seen far more decolonisation than imperial expansion, in terms of territory. And that has helped bring down war deaths enormously”, he said.The left has historically condemned the post-1945 global order because it baked in western advantage, but the more extreme elements of the right have despised it because it involved surrendering colonial assets, and helping old adversaries recover from the war.Trump spent much of his career as a property developer railing against Japanese competition, an antipathy he has since broadened to China. Much of his rhetoric over Venezuela and other would-be imperial targets revolves around reclaiming assets, such as oil industry infrastructure, that had been “stolen” from the US. So in Trump’s view, making America truly great again inevitably demands a return to expansion. Putin and Xi are bent on making Russia and China great again, for similar motives.Potential clash of empiresThe US seizure this week of an oil tanker,the Marinera, despite the fact it was Russian flagged and escorted by a Russian submarine, brought into urgent focus the question of whether, and for how long, the ambitions of the three superpowers can be reconciled without major conflict.“There can be really rather a protracted period of time in which empires can coexist,” Nathalie Tocci, the director of Italy’s Institute of International Affairs, said. “It’s not as if Trump is saying: I want to be the only empire; Trump is basically signalling and acting as if he’s absolutely fine with Russia and China being empires.“In the short to medium term, I would say that the greater risk is not the empires clashing with one another, but the subjugation of the colonies,” she said.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin and Xi Jinping attending a military parade in Beijing last year.Photograph: Rao Aimin/APPutin and Xi would certainly be content with a world sliced into spheres of influence. During the firstTrump administration, Russia informally floated the idea that the US could have a free hand in Venezuela in exchange for Russia holding sway over Ukraine in its sphere of influence.Fiona Hill, who at the time was serving in the Trump White House as the national security council director for Russian and European affairs, said: “The Russians were trying it on. It was all vague and a matter of hint-hint, wink-wink, saying: ‘Let’s talk about the Monroe doctrine,’ and then giving a meaningful look.”Hill said the first Trump administration rejected the suggestion of any such deal, but she acknowledged that the president’s views on empire had clearly evolved.“I remember actually telling people before that he was a real estate mogul. He didn’t want to own your country, just put up his buildings on it,” she said. “But I suppose it’s a quick jump for him from real estate to state acquisition, and that’s what we weren’t anticipating before.”Hill is not confident that the three great revanchist empires can stay out of each other’s way. In his newly whetted appetite for US expansionism, Trump has reserved the right to act far beyond his hemisphere, bombing Iran or even running Gaza.“He’s saying: ‘Hands off and keep away from the western hemisphere’, but he’s not necessarily going to leave China unchecked in the Asia-Pacific,” Hill said. “The US is still supposed to be an Asian-Pacific power, and part of the western hemisphere is in the Pacific.“This world is much more complex now,” she added. “It’s all very fragile, especially because we don’t know what mistakes he’s going to make.”Domestic considerationsTrump’s imperial impulses may be constrained, to some extent, byUS politics. Post-Venezuela polling suggested that large majorities, among Democrats and Republicans alike, were opposed to any long-term involvement in the country.However, Trump’s Maga base was thrilled by the success of the operation, and his long-sagging popularity gained a minor bump. For a president seeking to distract from an intractable affordability crisis at home and the looming threat of more child-trafficking revelations in the Epstein files, that may be enough to seek out other quick military spectacles abroad.With the guardrails of the old order demolished, Trump’s US would be an ever more chaotic factor in the world, not coherent enough to be called an empire but imperial in the imposition of suffering by the strong on the weak.Writing in Mother Jonesthis week, the magazine’s Washington editor, David Corn, suggested that is the essence of the real Trump doctrine: “Violence is ours to use, at home and abroad, to get what we want.”View image in fullscreenA military officer comforts Ramona Palma, the mother of the Venezuelan soldier Cesar Garcia, who was killed in the US raid, after his wake in Caracas.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/APWhat was the Monroedoctrine?The Trump administration has revived the 203-year-old Monroe doctrine, and made it the cornerstone of its newly aggressive policy in the Americas.TheUS national security strategy(NSS) published in November, stated that: “After years of neglect, the United States will reassert and enforce the Monroe doctrine to restore American pre-eminence in the western hemisphere.”Trump himself has bandied the term about, characteristically adapting it to the “Donroe doctrine”, a play on his first name to emphasise his ownership of the idea.The original doctrine, put forward by President James Monroe in 1823, meant something quite different. He proposed that the recently established United States act as a guarantor against European imperialism in the region, declaring the nations of the American continents were “not to be considered as subjects for future colonisation by any European powers”.In 1904, however, the doctrine was updated by President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt to suit the enthusiasm for US colonialism at the time, in the aftermath of the Spanish-American war. The “Roosevelt corollary” bestowed “international police power” on Washington to intervene anywhere in the Americas where it perceived there to be “chronic wrongdoing” by a sovereign government.The NSS declares a new “Trump corollary” to the doctrine, marking a return to colonial appetites, and the president’s focus on natural resources. It states no outside power has the right to “own or control strategically vital assets”."

YuckSat 10 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 12.49 ESTSharePicture the scene: you enter a lovely clean hotel room. There are newly laundered crisp sheets and fluffy fresh towels. But as you sit on the bed, the cushions let out a cloud of dust and you realise the bed is covered with an unwashed bedspread that has been sat on by every other guest who has ever visited this room. It’s usually slung across the bottom of the bed, so lots of them have probably put their feet on it, too.I hate decorative cushions and throws on hotel beds. The first thing I do on seeing them is remove them with the tips of my fingers and shove them in the wardrobe. Doesn’t everyone?Due to the often impressive efficiency of hospital corners on the bed, removing the throws can be a challenge, frequently resulting in wresting the entire duvet off the bed so I can discard the offending bedspread. And don’t get me started on when everything reappears on the bed the next day, and I have to begin my weird ritual all over again.I have a fairly normal standard of cleanliness. I’m not too bothered by the occasional cobweb or spot of dust. But the sight of cushions and throws on hotel beds fills me with dread. I can’t help thinking they are massively unhygienic – and ultimately gross. Who knows how many other people have used them and when they were last, if ever, washed.It’s puzzling as to why they are there, when part of the charm of staying at a hotel is the promise of a clean, fresh space to sleep. We all know other people have slept in the hotel bed before us, but something about the level of cleaning between each guest helps us to suspend disbelief and allows us to forget that we are sharing a bed with hundreds of strangers.The room is usually perfectly made up with a freshly restocked mini-fridge and packaged-up toiletries. We are made to feel as if we are opening the door to a place untarnished by other people. So why then, on the bed, the centre to all this, do they plonk this pile of old, unhygienic fabric? It might be for aesthetics, and sure, a scatter cushion or textural throw might look nice. But any visual pleasure is instantly undone by the full-body cringe when you consider the volume of strangers’ dust particles trapped inside it.In the romcom Along Came Polly, Jennifer Aniston’s free spirit Polly is seen helping free Ben Stiller’s uptight Reuben from the tyranny of his multiple scatter cushions. She does this by encouraging him to plunge a kitchen knife into his useless bedding accessories. “I’m liberating you,” she tells him. “Wow, that feels really good,” he replies, destroying the pillow.This catharsis is what I need when facing a hotel cushion or throw. At home they might feel pointless but in a hotel, they are both pointless and disgusting: plain wrong. Please liberate me from the horror of ever seeing them again on top of a joyfully clean hotel bed.Annabel Lee is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsHotelsOpinionHygieneHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Elon Musk, the owner of X, wrote on the platform on Friday that the UK government “want any excuse for censorship” and described the British government as “fascist”.View image in fullscreenLammy said he addressed use of Grok with Vance and found vice-president ‘sympathetic’ to UK’s position.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APIn an interview with the Guardian, Lammy said he addressed the use of Grok with Vance and found the vice-president “sympathetic” to the UK’s position.“We discussed Greenland and I also raised with him the Grok issue and the horrendous, horrific situation in which this new technology is allowing deepfakes and the manipulation of images of women and children, which is just absolutely abhorrent. He agreed with me that it was entirely unacceptable,” Lammy said on Friday.Asked if Vance was sympathetic to the UK government’s stance on Grok, Lammy said: “I think he recognised the very seriousness with which images of women and children could be manipulated in this way, and he recognised how despicable, unacceptable, that is and I found him sympathetic to that position. And in fact, we’ve been in touch again, today, about this very serious issue.”“He confirmed with me that he had seen that there had been some changes announced by X as of this morning.”On Friday, X appeared to have changed Grok’s settings, with the chatbot telling users that only paid subscribers could ask it to manipulate images.View image in fullscreenCongresswoman and Trump supporter Anna Paulina Luna has called for sanctions against the UK if it goes through with a ban on X.Photograph: Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockHowever, reports suggested this only applied to those making requests in reply to other posts, and other ways of editing or creating images, including on a separate Grok website, remained open.Elon Musk’s X threatened with UK ban over wave of indecent AI imagesRead moreVance also expressed concerns about the use of AI technology, adding that it was being used to fuel “hyper-pornographied slop”, sources at the meeting said.Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, has said she would back the media regulator Ofcom if it decided ban X if it failed to comply with UK laws. “Sexually manipulating images of women and children is despicable and abhorrent,” she said. The media watchdog, Ofcom, confirmed it would accelerate an investigation into X.Musk responded by sharing a post from US legislator Luna threatening to issue sanctions against Keir Starmer and the UK if X was blocked in the country.Lammy and Vance met at a particularly sensitive time for US-UK relations after Trump repeated his claims to Greenland following a US operation to capture the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.View image in fullscreenLiz Kendall, the technology secretary, has said she would back the media regulator, Ofcom, if it decided to ban X.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAStarmer, and other European leaders, issued a statement on Tuesday warning the Danish-held territory’s security must be ensured collectively by Nato.Lammy said he and Vance discussed the war in Ukraine, including “giving the Ukrainians the security guarantees that they require” and the “emerging situation in Venezuela”, as well as tensions over Greenland.International laws and codes are under “tremendous strain”, Lammy said.“We’re realists, and must accept that we’re now living in a multipolar world. It’s a world no longer where there’s just one superpower and the members of the [UN] security council. And so, of course, the rule of law is under tremendous strain. And we lose it, it seems to me, at our peril,” he said.Indonesia blocks Musk’s Grok chatbot due to risk of pornographic contentRead moreLammy, the former foreign secretary, has developed a friendship with Vance.

The move has put him on a collision course with rebel MPs who have criticised the move.Karl Turner, the MP for Kingston upon Hull East, told Times Radio that members of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) were “seething” with Starmer and Lammy over the policy, and said the prime minister “ought to be ashamed of himself”.“I’ve said to the prime minister I want to see him face-to-face on this single issue and I expect him to instruct Lammy to stop and think again,” Turner, a former criminal barrister, said.Explore more on these topicsJD VanceXPornographyDavid LammyInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

They chanted: “Death to Khamenei,” in reference to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and: “Long live the shah.”New protests broke out late on Saturday with people rallying in a northern district of Tehran, according to a video verified by AFP.View image in fullscreenA mosque is set on fire during protests in Tehran, Iran, 10 January 2026.Photograph: Social Media/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockFireworks were set off over Tehran’s Punak Square as demonstrators banged pots and shouted slogans in support of the Pahlavi rulers ousted after the 1979 Islamic revolution, the video showed.Crowds of protesters also marched through the streets of Mashhad as fires burned around them, a show of defiance in the home town of Khamenei, who has condemned the protesters as “vandals” and blamed the US for fanning the flames of dissent.Iran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some timeRead moreMap of protests in IranDonald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Iranian authorities kill protesters, earning angry rebukes from Tehran. He said on Friday that the Iranian authorities were “in big trouble”, adding: “You better not start shooting, because we’ll start shooting too.”On Saturday night he said the US is “ready to help” as protesters inIranfaced an intensifying crackdown by authorities of the Islamic republic.“Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!” Trump said in a social post on Truth Social, without elaborating.Those authorities warned people to not take part in protests on Saturday. The country’s attorney general, Mohammad Mahvadi Azad, said anyone who did so would be considered an “enemy of god”, a charge which carries the death penalty. State TV later clarified that anyone who even assisted protesters could face the charge.Despite the crackdown, more protests were planned for the weekend. Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah of Iran, called for protesters to take to the streets on Saturday and Sunday and seize control of their towns. Pahlavi, who has emerged as an increasingly popular figure in the current round of protests, asked people to hoist the pre-1979 “lion and sun” flag that was used during his father’s rule.“Our goal is no longer merely to come into the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize city centres and hold them,” he said, promising he would return to Iran soon.The continuing block on the internet and mobile networks means it is hard for international media to estimate the size of the demonstrations, the largest in Iran in recent years, which pose a serious challenge to the regime’s rule.View image in fullscreenAyatollah Ali Khamenei, pictured on 9 January, has blamed the US for whipping up the protests.Photograph: Iranian Supreme Leader’s Office/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockBut the few videos coming out of the country, as well as activists who managed to evade the blackout via the Starlink satellite system, spoke of angry protesters and a heavy-handed police response.“We’re standing up for a revolution, but we need help. Snipers have been stationed behind the Tajrish Arg area [a wealthy neighbourhood in Tehran],” a protester in Tehran told the Guardian via sporadic text messages sent via Starlink. The protester said many people had been shot at across the city, adding: “We saw hundreds of bodies.”The Guardian was not able to independently verify the protesters’ claims and human rights activists have also said verification of reported human rights violations is difficult.However, another activist in Tehran told the Guardian they had witnessed security forces firing live ammunition at protesters and saw a “very high” number killed, while human rights activists said the claims of police brutality were consistent with testimony they had been given.The US-based Human Rights Activist news agency has said that at least 72 people had been killed in the violence surrounding the protests and more than 2,300 others detained. Rights groups and Iranian authorities have also documented casualties among security forces, which the latter blame on foreign-backed saboteurs.Map of protestsThe Iranian Nobel peace prize-winner Shirin Ebadi warned on Friday that security forces could be preparing to commit a “massacre under the cover of a sweeping communications blackout”, and said she had already received reports of hundreds of people being treated for eye injuries at a single Tehran hospital.Protesters were brought to the streets on 28 December by a deteriorating economy, but quickly began chanting anti-government slogans and demanding political reform.Though Iran has experienced mass protests before, analysts have said the battering of the regime during the 12-day war with Israel and the loss of Iranian-backed forces across the region have made it more vulnerable.Iranian authorities have become increasingly confrontational in their rhetoric towards protesters, casting them as being infiltrated and backed by Israeli, or US saboteurs. The Iranian army vowed in a statement on Saturday to foil “the enemy’s plots”, warning that undermining the country’s security was a “red line”.State TV tried to portray an air of normality as protests continued, describing them as small aberrations from an otherwise peaceful country. A state television anchor warned protesters not to go out, telling parents to stop their children from demonstrating. “If something happens, if someone is injured, if a bullet is fired and something happens to them, do not complain,” they said.The international community has rallied around the protesters, with EU states and the US posting messages of support. “The United States supports the brave people of Iran,” Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said on X on Saturday.Iranian authorities have tried a carrot-and-stick approach, distinguishing between what they called “legitimate” protesters expressing economic grievances and “rioters” backed by foreign powers trying to destablise Iran. The government has said it is engaging in dialogue with the former, but human rights groups have described increasing generalised violence directed at protesters at the hands of security officials.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Tehran on 9 January.Photograph: MAHSA/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty ImagesA video verified by Iran Human Rights group showed distressed family members looking through a pile of bodies in Ghadir hospital in Tehran on Thursday. The rights group said that the bodies were of protesters killed by authorities.Fars news agency, a news agency close to the Iranian security services, aired video of what appeared to be forced confessions of protesters.Human rightsactivists warned that forced confessions, while in themselves a human rights violation, were often used as evidence for executions in Iran.The continuing internet blackout made documenting both the momentum of protests and the violations committed against demonstrators difficult, and activists were trying to create workarounds. They implored media to continue covering the situation in Iran as they described worsening brutality.“Please make sure to state clearly that they are killing people with live ammunition,” an Iranian activist said.Explore more on these topicsIranRights and freedomMiddle East and north AfricaAyatollah Ali KhameneiDonald TrumpHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

The area is home to Unesco-listed ancient ruins and was once controlled by jihadist fighters.“The strikes today targeted ISIS throughout Syria” and were part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched “in direct response to the deadly ISIS attack on US and Syrian forces in Palmyra,” US Central Command said in a statement on X.The US and Jordan carried out a previous round of strikes as part of the same operation last month, hitting dozens of Islamic State group targets.View image in fullscreenAn image taken from video released by the US Central Command after US strikes against Islamic State in Syria.Photograph: US Central Command/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Palmyra attack was the first such incident since the overthrow of Syria’s longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.The US personnel who were targeted were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the international effort to combat IS, which seized swaths of Syrian and Iraqi territory in 2014.The jihadists were ultimately defeated by local ground forces backed by international airstrikes and other support, but IS still has a presence in Syria, especially in the country’s vast desert.The US president, Donald Trump, has long been sceptical of American troops being in Syria, ordering their withdrawal during his first term but ultimately leaving them in place.British and French aircraft attack underground Islamic State weapons store in SyriaRead moreThe Pentagon announced in April that the US would halve the number of personnel in Syria in the following months, while the US’s special envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, said in June that Washington would eventually reduce its bases in the country to one.Explore more on these topicsIslamic StateSyriaUS militaryMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But despite the vast distance, he watched her constantly through cameras which beamed into a screen in his Brisbane home.“He would say: ‘I can always see what you do’,” she recalls through an interpreter.While her husband was visiting his family home in India in 2017, the cameras were installed in the house – in the kitchen, living room and outdoor area – after the couple’s first child was born.Two years earlier, the couple had married in a Sikh ceremony in Punjab, near the India-Pakistan border. But in the subsequent eight years, her husband would visit his wife just four times in India, staying for about a month.View image in fullscreen‘They’re not going elsewhere because of issues of culture, tradition, shame, honour and embarrassment’ … Yasmin Khan of the Bangle Foundation, a support organisation that helps women like Kiran.Photograph: David Kelly/The GuardianKiran is one of thousands of Indian women to have been sold a dream that they would migrate overseas once they were married and “start a new life” only for it to turn to a nightmare, says Yasmin Khan, the head of Queensland-based service the Bangle Foundation, which supports south Asian women facing domestic abuse.Women’s rights advocates say the phenomenon is creating“abandoned brides”– women deserted after their wedding day by Indian-born husbands living abroad in countries including the UK, Australia and Canada.Meet the whistleblowers who exposed Queensland’s domestic violence failures: ‘I was warned they would pulverise me’Read moreSome abandonments are for financial gain, with husbands absconding with a dowry – which remains widespread despite becoming illegal in India in 1961. In other cases, husbands use their wives to provide domestic help for their in-laws in India which some advocates liken to modern slavery.Other men may want to take their wife overseas but unforeseen visa issues prevent this.Human rights campaigners have documented cases ofabandoned brides living in Australia, with legal recourse often complex.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn Kiran’s case, her husband promised they would split their time between India and Australia before eventually settling down under to raise their children. But when she fell pregnant, he told her he would “never let” her join him in Australia.“I came to realise this life was not for me. He had no interest in me. I had just been bought here to take care of others,” she says.The then 22-year-old knew little of the man before their wedding day. But what she knew – he held permanent residency in Australia, worked a white collar job and abstained from alcohol – made him an eligible match in her family’s eyes.But after a month of marriage, Kiran’s husband flew back to Australia to resume work, and during the handful of times he visited India arguments often turned violent.Over long-distance phone calls from Brisbane, Kiran’s husband told her to follow his mother’s orders for domestic duties, which included cooking and cleaning for her in-laws.“He would say I can see you on the camera – make sure what you cook is fresh for my parents,” she says.By early 2022, Kiran’s mental health was deteriorating and there were calls from community elders in Punjab – which has been labelled by advocates an epicentre of abandoned brides – for the family to be reunited. It prompted her husband to travel to India and bring her and the children to Australia the following year.“At that time, I thought God has finally listened to my prayers and I will get to live with my husband, my children will have a father,” Kiran says.But when she arrived in Brisbane she discovered her husband, who later initiated divorce proceedings, had brought her to Australia on a tourist visa instead of a partner visa, which has a pathway to permanent residency.It meant she had no legal right to stay indefinitely despite her children being Australian citizens.Khan, who supported Kiran after the couple’s separation, says her husband’s surveillance and power he exerted over her through the vulnerability of her being on a temporary visa were forms of coercive control that she faced – issues that many of the service’s clients face.Bangle – which relies on state government support, grants and donations, but receives no ongoing funding – takes about 1,000 calls for help on domestic abuse, visa abuse and trafficking each year, with 60% of those from women based interstate and abroad.Khan says fear of having to “explain” cultural norms like arranged marriages can be a barrier tomigrant and culturally and linguistically diverse (Cald) women experiencing domestic abuseseeking help from a mainstream service.“They’re not going elsewhere because of issues of culture, tradition, shame, honour and embarrassment.”Kiran, who remains in visa limbo, is fighting to be able to stay in Australia with her two children. She clings to the hope that her children can give her the happiness she craved from her husband.*Name has been changedIn Australia, the nationalfamily violence counselling serviceis on 1800 737 732.

The sun never rises above the horizon, instead bathing Sweden’s most northerly town of Kiruna in a blue crepuscular light, or “civil twilight” as it is known, for two or three hours a day stretching visibility a few metres, notwithstanding heavy snow.But 900 metres below the arctic conditions, a team of 20 gather every day, forgoing the brief glimpse of natural light and spearheading the EU’s race to mine its own rare earths.Despite identification of several deposits around the continent, and some rare earth refineries including Solvay in France, there are no operational rare earth mines inEurope.Across the globe, the scramble for rare earths has become the source of huge geopolitical tension, withChinaaccused last year by the EU of “weaponising” its near monopoly on raw materials and end products, essential for everything from smartphones, to electric cars, to fridges, music speakers and military jets.China’s willingness to slap export bans on rare earths led to the vicious trade war with Donald Trump last year and is partly driving his current bid to take over Greenland, which is rich in these materials, now among the most precious in the world.Every day the team at LKAB mine in Kiruna drive 4km (2.5 miles) down an impressive networkof tunnels to get closer to what is known as the Per Geijer deposit of magnetite-hematite-phosphate named after the Swedish geologist who identified it more than 100 years ago.The team are now operating at two levels – 900m and 1.3km deep underground as they try to connect the existing vast iron ore mine in Kiruna with Per Geijer about 2km away.LKAB in Kiruna has started tunnelling for rare earths by creating a link with the existing iron ore mine.LKAB in Kiruna has started tunnelling for rare earths by creating a link with the existing iron ore mineUsing remote technology they drill a fan of 84 holes in the rock face; pump them with explosives which are then blasted between 1.15am and 1.45am every night, sometimes disturbing the inhabitants overground, and causing subsidence thathas led to the state-owned compamy moving parts of the town and its church.Less than four hours later the team are back.“At 5am in the morning, when we have ventilated out the blasting fumes, we start the mucking out,” says 37-year-old Kiruna native Jim Lidström, who leads the tunnelling to what is one of Europe’s largest deposits of rare earths.Once cleared, a separate team of men and women, sitting in a modern console centre 1.3k below ground, “scale” the rock, remotely controlling machines that break the detritus into transportable chunks for onward transport to a driverless train.View image in fullscreenJim Lidström leads the team tunnelling towards the Per Geijer deposit in the LKAB iron ore mine in Kiruna.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianLidström’s team then set about making the tunnel stable and usable, drilling bolts into the freshly made walls and then spraying it with a layer of concrete or “shotcrete” before the whole process starts all over again.“We do about five metres a day,” Lidström says.The hunt for rare earths is slow.The 17 rare earth elements – all found in Kiruna – include neodymium and praseodymium, critical materials for the powerful permanent magnets needed for everything from electric cars to household appliances and military jets.Emil Riggio in the ‘scaling’ control room, where staff guide drills that break down the rocks to transportable chunks, which are moved to skips that are then picked up by driverless trains.Emil Riggio in the ‘scaling’ control room, where staff guide drills that break down the rocks to transportable chunks, which are moved to skips that are then picked up by driverless trainsAlthough geological surveys show large ore bodies across the west – including the Fen complex in Norway, thought to be Europe’s largest deposit – from mine to refined end production could take 10 to 15 years, say experts.“I think people often miss the point. They say ‘why don’t we just produce rare earths in Europe?’. But you have to have the entire supply chain to do that,” says Nigel Steward, a professor at Imperial College London, a materials scientist and a former executive in the US mining industry.The experience in Kiruna shows just how challenging it is to reduce the EU’s dependency on China, which is now the core supplier of rare earth magnets and willing to choke supplies, as it did last year, if politically desirable.State-owned LKAB is now trying to accelerate the process of mining, extraction, and separation of the crumbs from the ore, to help the EU de-risk as quickly as possible.View image in fullscreenKiruna is Sweden’s northernmost town and temperatures often drop to -20C.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianJan Moström, the chief executive of LKAB, explains that it could take “years and years” if the company tried to expose the entire length of the Per Geijer deposit for mining purposes.“But that is not what we are going to do. What we are going to do is to open up incrementally,” he says.View image in fullscreenLKAB chief executive Jan Moström says it could take ‘years and years’ to expose the entire length of the Per Geijer deposit.Photograph: Fotograf Mats LundqvistHe refuses to give a timeline because of its sensitivity, instead explaining the complex task ahead in the vast network of tunnels circling the deposit.“The main focus for us now in the Kiruna system is to find a mine design to deal with the mining of the present reserves down to the main level, at 1,365 metres , then to work out how we go beneath that and develop that resource into reserves, and also how to connect the Per Geijer deposit into the [existing iron ore mining] system. We will start to develop it incrementally, and that is the huge difference [from previous approaches],” he says.View image in fullscreenA plan of the Kiruna mine showing the shard-like deposits of iron and rare earths.Photograph: Lisa O’CarrollFor Moström, who has spent his career in mines, the last 11 with LKAB, the stranglehold Beijing has built in rare earths was no accident, and something he has been pressing home in Brussels repeatedly.As the US and Europe started to regulate against toxic waste in the 1980s, China which had none of the environmental concerns, ploughed on charring the landscape as it went building a chokehold on raw materials now critical for modern life.“I’ve been talking in Brussels the past two or three years about the huge disadvantages we created in the 1970s and the 1980s when we closed the mining industry and started importing metals from South America, Africa, Australia,” he says.Asked why it has taken the EU so long to wake up to the dangers of dependency on China’s rare earth supply, he is blunt: “Politicians will never be more courageous than the voters.”“Nobody saw any future in mining, then the super-cycle started and China started to consume enormous volumes of metals,” he says referring to the boom at the turn of the century when China drove a huge commodities boom on the back of urbanisation.“I have the perception that the European Commission, the commissioners, really understand the importance of domestic mining and some sort of self-sufficiency,” Moström says.View image in fullscreenLKAB aims to open up the rare earth resources incrementally.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianAs part of the acceleration efforts, LKAB has put €80m (£69m) into a new “demonstration” plant in nearby Luleå to test the process of separation before mining even begins. It has also taken a stake in the Norwegian company REEtec to develop an environmentally friendly way of refining the extract.Contrary to what the name suggests, rare earths – a group of 17 soft metals with unique properties such as strong magnetismor high temperature resistance – are not rare.Speckled like crumbs in the earth’s crust, the tag “rare” stuck because of the difficulty accessing them, mining them, and separating them from the ore in which they are found, a process that can take a decade.LKAB has already been visited by a line of Brussels dignitaries, including industry commissioner Stéphane Séjourné in September, because is represents the EU’s best current hope of weaning itself of a dependency on Chinese supplies that has left Europe vulnerable to increasing geopolitical tensions.View image in fullscreenA new town is being built a few kilometres away from the mine because of subsidence.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianDespite the rhetoric in Brussels, London and Washington over the need to wean industries off China, Beijing will hold the rare earth cards for years to come.“Right now China controls 85% of the final processing of light rare earths and it control 100% of the heavy rare earths,” says Darren Wilson, the chief executive of LKAB’s industrial minerals division.According to senior European Commission officials in December the EUuses 20,000 tonnes of permanent magnets, a year of which 17,000 to 18,000 come from China, creating an unbalanced and high-risk trade relationship.Last April, in retaliation against Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, China imposed global export restrictions on rare earths, hitting Europe’s car industry. It threatened to impose more restrictions in October, until a 12-month truce was agreed with Trump at in Korea the same month.View image in fullscreenThe LKAB mine is bathed in low blue light in December.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianAs George Riddell, a senior adviser at Flint Global and a trade expert, says: “China has not just got the capacity to weaponise its trade but shown it has the willingness to do so.”All hopes rest on LKAB now being the first to reduce the EU’s reliance on China, with a pre-existing highly developed mining operation employing about 2,000 workers directly and double that indirectly.Magnetic appeal: what are permanent magnets?Magnetic properties of some metals were discovered by the Greeks 4,000 years ago.Permanent magnets, found in speakers, headphones, toys, cars and military equipment are typically manufactured from a neodymium-iron-boron alloy.The process begins by melting suitable raw materials, placing them into a mould that is then chilled, resulting in a powder. All the particles have then to align in the right direction to create a powerful magnetic force. The powder is sintered in a furnace, bonding the particles together into a mass that is then cut for final use.Permanent magnets were developed in the research department of the General Motors Company in the US and by the Japanese materials scientist Masato Sagawa in the 1980s.But making these powerful magnets generates radioactive byproducts that can contaminate water and soil.As the west introduced environmental regulations in the 1980s, US rare earth suppliers “started exporting their product to China because they were willing to process it,” says Imperial College London’s Steward.GM is now working with Mountain Pass, the only operational rare earth mine in the US, which is thought to be about two years away from producing products for the American market.“There is no reason why we can’t remake magnets. They were our inventions, in the west. That is the crazy thing,” Steward says.Explore more on these topicsCritical mineralsMiningGlobal economyEconomicsSwedenChinafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But physiotherapists were probably standing up in their seats cheering at the display of such healthy and limber hip movements.Hips are a key weight-bearing joint, yet we rarely give them the amount of love and attention they deserve.“You might not realise how important it is or how much it does until it’s painful or restricted in some way, and you’re no longer able to use it in the same way that you could before,” says a physiotherapist, Dr Michael O’Brien from La Trobe University in Melbourne. A hip fracture, particularly in elderly people, can precede a serious decline in health, which makes maintaining hip health vital for healthy old age.Strengthen your hip musclesThe ball-and-socket hip joint is very mobile, able to move in many directions and rotate, so it’s vital to keep the muscles around the hip joint strong to support it and reduce the risk of pain and hip osteoarthritis, O’Brien says.“That can be doing reformer pilates, it could be doing some simple exercises at home, some simple weight-bearing exercises,” he says.It’s also important to work the hip across all the planes of movement, not just back and forth. Some simple exercises include standing on one foot and rotating your pelvis from side to side, or holding the lunge position and moving the front knee slightly from side to side.The gluteal muscles in the buttocks, and abdominal stabilising muscles are also important for hip health, says a physiotherapist, Dr Jillian Eyles from the University of Sydney.“The tiny, boringglute exercisesactually really hurt [in terms of fatiguing muscles]and they’re really boring … [but] they’re the ones that are really helpful,” Eyles says.Gluteal exercises include squats, lunges and a “gluteal bridge” – lying on your back, planting the soles of your feet on the floor or bed and lifting your pelvis up off that surface. For abdominal core strengthening and stabilising, she also recommends reformer pilates or yoga.Stay activeFor all the hype about “10,000 steps a day” being the ideal – and unproven – goal for physical activity, the evidence actually suggests that significant benefits accrue at far lower step counts, says Prof Rana Hinman, a research physiotherapist at the University of Melbourne.“[Ten thousand] was a really scary number, I think even for someone who didn’t have health problems … and for someone with joint pain, or someone who’s older, that’s just an unachievable goal,” she says. But research suggestseven 7,000 steps a day can have major benefits for health.‘They don’t have a nice socket structure’: how to really look after your kneesRead more“Even for every extra 1,000 steps that you can do, we’re seeing it now with mortality benefits, cardiovascular benefits, and we see it with osteoarthritis, with knowing that we can prevent functional decline over time as well,” Hinman says.She also stresses that even older people with hip pain or osteoarthritis shouldn’t let it stop them participating in physical activity they enjoy. “Generally there’s no evidence thatphysical activity is going to make your X-rays worse, for example, or push you to needing joint replacement surgery quicker,” she says. “It’s really much more about what the person enjoys doing, what their joint allows them to do, and feels comfortable with doing.”Falls preventionMore than 16,000 Australians aged over 45 yearsfracture a hipeach year, 90% of those require surgery and about one-quarter of people who experience their first hip fracture die within a year. Among older Australians, falls prevention is a vital part of hip health.Part of this is just recognising that activities that used to be easy when we were younger can be dangerous as we age and our balance and vision diminish.“A lot of people when they’re putting their underwear on or shoes or socks, will try and stand on one leg as they do that,” O’Brien says. “Often that’s something that we stop doing as we get older, and we sit down because it’s a little bit safer.”Falls prevention clinics, which can be found in hospitals around the country, can also provide education, physiotherapy and exercise programs to help reduce the risk of repeat falls.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe way you moveFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s also a chihuahua, and one of dozens of pets being used to tap into an increasingly lucrative influencer market on social media.Our dog’s affections remain a sweet mystery even as Odie turns five today | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreAs a person who owns a dog and uses the internet, I have not been immune to the attractions of propelling my pet to fame.This has sent me to some dark places, including briefly signing up my labrador to a pet modelling agency that yielded no results and was probably a scam.But one thought has always persisted: how hard could it be to make him famous on social media? Is this my ticket to endless riches? And could I go it alone?My mission, agreed to by editors, was clear. Over a short period, I would devote myself to newly created Instagram and TikTok accounts for my dog, Murphy. The goal? Popularity and virality (paid sponsorships, of course, were out of the question).I started with research, which involved scrolling the accounts of Australian pet influencers who had already made it and making a series of dot points that included: “outfits”, “appearance of wealth”, “smiling” and “dog has a job/skills/talent”.Unlike Winnie, a red Australian cattle dog with 600,000 followers, Murphy could not scale walls, herd sheep or jump through complex hoops. I could not transform my rental apartment into a film set. His outfits consisted of bandanas and a funny shirt I bought him for Halloween.Instead, I vowed to home in on his charm: being a little bit naughty.View image in fullscreenMurphy plays ball – but what else will it take to make him internet famous?Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian‘Destined for Instagram fame’Many account handles were taken, so I settled for “murphythegoldenlabdog”, which I felt was nicely literal and to the point.My younger colleague advised me that the key to going viral was posting enough that something stuck, so I made seven posts in quick succession: Murphy smiling in a park, Murphy wearing my hat on the beach, Murphy drinking a “dog-rita” at the pub, Murphy with a cute puppy.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Instead, the only interaction I received was from friends and family members who were in on the experiment.“Same,” my friend commented on a picture of Murphy drinking a cocktail. “This is the face of a dog destined for Instagram fame,” one colleague replied.I managed to make it to 100 followers in less than a week, largely thanks to posting in various group chats with a hint of desperation (the vast majority were co-workers or friends of my Mum).My next challenge was videos. I am only a year shy of being a Gen Z, but TikTok remains a mystery to me. My teenage years consisted of Photobooth and blogs, not viral videos of dance routines.With assistance from my hip colleagues on the video team, I was told to make sure my clips were backed by popular music and find a niche. My first video, captioned “caught in the act”, showed Murphy attempting to get into his pet food before being sprung, backed to a Taylor Swift song.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

Why did I only have 43 followers on TikTok, and why couldn’t I crack it big on Instagram despite promising follower 200 would receive a signed autograph?The clues began to come in the form of comments and private messages on Murphy’s Instagram account. “Send me this pic,” one pet page with 129,000 followers wrote on a picture of Murphy sleeping in his bed. “Share us this!!” another daily pet page commented.When I engaged with the accounts, they would ask if I’d like to “feature my profile” on their page, and prompt me to send a few photos alongside a caption. After this I would receive a big block of text offering various packages that cost between $20 and $500 depending on how many followers I wanted to gain.When I said I couldn’t pay, they would go dark.Had it really come to this?So this was how the world of pet influencers worked. Multiple accounts, it seemed, were making significant profits off the back of people who wanted their pets to go viral and, in turn, could receive their own benefits in the form of paid sponsorships and promotions.Eddie the chihuahua’s owner/manager, Sue Waters, advised me under no circumstances to put any funding behind promotion.She’s never done it, she said, but it helps that she has a background in advertising – and that she got Eddie during Covid, when everyone had more free time.“The more you post and the more time you spend [online], the more you’re rewarded with visibility,” she said. “If you’re in a growth phase, trying to get followers and build, you’re wanting to spend up to 10 hours a week [on it]. And it’s not just putting up a post and then walking away and leaving it. You’ve got to interact with people, you’ve got to comment, respond.”View image in fullscreen‘Just a man enjoying some time in the sun’ … Murphy sports one of his bandanas.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianAt the same time, “it helps to have something a little bit more than just a cute dog”.“Eddie has a personality,” she said. “And I put that out there on Instagram.”As pure desperation began to hit, I went to the library and printed out flyers of Murphy’s face with a link to his Instagram handle. I would play it the old way, like a newspaper journalist before the invention of computers.“Hi, I’m Murphy,” the posters read. “My mum is trying to make me famous on Instagram as a weird social experiment. Please follow me … Thanks for reading.”As we farewelled Ronda our soft-hearted labrador, the grief was as painful as any I’ve felt | Paul DaleyRead moreAs I stuck them to poles at a park on Sydney’s foreshore, a pang of sadness hit me. Had it really come to this? Sticking up flyers instead of enjoying a walk with my labrador?On the last weekend of the experiment, Murphy and I attended a friend’s 30th birthday. He disappeared for a while and returned to the group covered in a black substance, to cries of laughter that quickly turned into shrieks as it became apparent he’d climbed into a septic tank.“Shut the doors!” people screamed. My friends urged me to film the disaster for content. I went to get my phone, but a wave of fatigue washed over me. Couldn’t we just enjoy this moment in its pure form? Must everything be turned into a commodity for attention, clicks and likes?I walked Murphy away from the group down to the creek, and we shared a poignant moment. I watched him blissfully frolic in the water, unburdened by society’s expectations, just a man enjoying some time in the sun.“I could learn a lot from you,” I mused, the smell of shit wafting through the air.Explore more on these topicsDogsSummer essentialsInstagramSocial mediaAnimalsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as the world shut down they took a leap togetherFind more stories fromthe moment I knew seriesAs told toDoosie MorrisSat 10 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 20.12 ESTShareThe first time Jake and I crossed paths was at a circus festival in Bathurst. It was 2010 and I was in my last year of high school. Aspiring circus troupes from across the country had gathered to showcase their acts.It felt as though all eyes were on Jake’s group from Adelaide. They were incredibly talented. I definitely remember him – I even took one of his workshops – but didn’t think much more of it.I left my home town, Ulladulla, not long after, trained at the National Institute ofCircusArts and launched a freelance acrobatic career in Melbourne. Meanwhile Jake’s troupe had become a company. Gravity & Other Myths was on the ascent, touring internationally, so when a position came up for a flyer I didn’t hesitate to apply.My first interview was a vibe check of sorts via Zoom. I played it pretty cool and apparently this made a great impression on everyone but Jake, who wasn’t sure I was the right fit. But they took me on for a month-long contract and before I knew it I was on a plane to join them in Austria.It was December 2018 and it felt like a dream. I was terrified but absolutely buzzing when I arrived in Vienna. I took this stunning train ride through snow-covered mountains to Graz to meet the group.I was a bit star-struck as we dived straight into rehearsals. Training was intense, my skin was ripped up from all the swinging and I was petrified of all the new skills the routine demanded. By the time I found myself behind the curtain for my first performance, I almost blacked out from nerves. But opening night was a success and I had never been more proud.I had a boyfriend back home in Australia so the quick connection I made with Jake on the tour was purely platonic, at first. We bonded over a shared love of condiments and often split our after-show meals because we had such similar tastes. Life on tour is pretty intimate; the whole troupe would get coffees together every morning and eat together every night. I’d gravitate towards Jake because he’s so funny, always mucking around and propping up the mood. I just loved his energy.View image in fullscreenAlyssa and Jacob rehearsing in Canada in 2019My contract was extended and eventually the distance became too much for my boyfriend. As soon as Jake caught wind of my breakup he wasted no time in making his interests known. This came as quite the surprise – I didn’t even realise he thought I was cute. Our chemistry began to shift and things got flirty.We were in California in 2019 when things really shifted gear. Hanging out on the beach between shows, eating tacos and enjoying the weather, the boundary between tour buddy and lover dissolved.The moment I knew: I was ready to paddle back to shore when she leaned in to kiss meRead moreWe didn’t want to rock the boat professionally so we kept our romance a secret from the rest of the company as we returned for another season in Europe later that year. In Paris in the dead of winter we’d steal some extra time together every night after the show. These secret rendezvous felt like something out of a movie. Huddled under a spooky bridge by the Canal de l’Ourcq we were like two little penguins who couldn’t bear to leave each other’s side. We’d chat and giggle and kiss for hours.It didn’t matter that it was past midnight, that I was bone-tired from performing or that it was -2C, being there with Jake was the only place I wanted to be.View image in fullscreenThe couple on the road at Bryce Canyon, Utah, in 2022At the start of 2020 we were looking down the barrel of endless touring but by chance we were headed back to Australia for some shows – just as the world shut down. Jake had an apartment in Adelaide and I moved straight in.It was a stressful few years but we have always had so much fun together. All the time we spent on the road meant we knew each other so well before we moved in together. Taking our relationship from showmance to what it is now was really organic. We still tour most of the year and still split our meals but we spend less time hiding under bridges.Alyssa Moore and Jacob Randell will be on stage in Gravity & Others Myth’sTen Thousand Hoursat Arts Centre Melbourne from 13 to 25 JanuaryTell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

They had clearly forgotten the joy of watching half-clad hulks with silly names go to battle, says superfan Helen Pidd as she heads backstageHelen PiddSat 10 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareWhen Gladiators is filming at the Sheffield Arena, it feels as if everyone is in on the joke. The woman in the ticket office looks at me gravely. “Before I give you these,” she says, “I need to ask a question. These areverygood tickets. You’re in the camera block, near the red contestant’s friends and family. So there’s something I need to know. If the camera is on you, are you going to duck and hide and get all embarrassed? Or are you going to go absolutely flipping mental?”I’ve been up until the early hours painting portraits of my favourite Gladiators with the precise hope of making it on to the telly. Of course I’m going to go absolutely flipping mental! I’ve been waiting for this day since 1992.That was when Gladiators muscled its way into the Saturday night viewing schedule of every kid in Britain, a copy of an American gameshow that pitted superhuman bodybuilders with silly names against fitness enthusiasts with ordinary jobs. You’d have Saracen using a pugil stick to batter Colin, a painter and decorator from Runcorn; or Lightning chasing Suzie, a dinner lady from Woking, up a climbing wall. It was an immediate playground sensation, spawning catchphrases that are etched indelibly on the memory of every 90s kid. Shout, “Contenders, ready!” in a Scottish accent to any of my contemporaries and they will reply, “Gladiators, ready!” quicker than they can remember their own children’s birthdays.The boys had posters of Jet, the buxom brunette, on their walls. The girls fancied Hunter, a blond with pecs the size of car tyres. Everyone pretended to hate Wolf, the show’s resident villain and theatrical bad loser, who would sometimes be awarded yellow cards for unsportsmanlike behaviour – one of which he once gobbled in protest.View image in fullscreenThe original Gladiators, including bad guy Wolf (front right) …View image in fullscreen… being cheered on by an audience in Birmingham. Photographs: ITV/ShutterstockYou could watch it with your mum and dad without it being embarrassing. You could recreate it in PE when your teacher wasn’t looking. Wolf aside, it was an hour-long lesson in fair play, where the strongest man or woman always won in the end – in a nail-biting finale known as the Eliminator, which involved a scrambling net, a zipwire and the fearsome 45-degree Travelator.Yet when the BBC brought back Gladiators in 2024, the commission was greeted with derision, proof that our public broadcaster had run out of ideas. Alex Mahon, then chief executive of Channel 4,singled it outas exactly the sort of thing the BBCshouldn’tbe making. But as soon as the titles rolled and everyone over 35 realised they could still remember the lyrics of the theme tune – “Do you have the speed, the strength, the heart to be a winner? It’s not for beginners” – it was a hit.‘Gladiators ... ready!’ Whatever became of Wolf, Jet, Rhino and the show’s other stars?Read moreAlmost nine million peoplewatched the first episode. It vastly overperformed among young people, none of whom were born when the original Gladiators came off air in the year 2000. It’s that rarest of things: a show the whole family can watch together. A slice of silliness in scary times. With the third series about to air, BBC executives will be hoping the Gladiators can unite the nation, shouting at their tellies like they did whenNick Mohammed failed to pick Alan Carr as a traitorlast autumn.Thirty-three years after I first booed Wolf in front of a TV dinner, I’m sitting in the third row of the Sheffield Arena waving a foam finger as a contestant crashes to the mat while Another One Bites the Dust booms from the PA. And they say dreams don’t come true.I’d gone so mad making posters, I even had one that read simply “CLATTENBURG” in honour of Mark Clattenburg, the former badboy of football refereeing who adjudicates in the reboot. I wave it manically in his direction and my friend Danika and I dissolve into schoolgirl giggles when he spots it and makes a heart with his thumbs and forefingers. We both squeal when he first booms the immortal words, “Contender, you will go on my first whistle … ”Four months later, I’m in a photo studio in Salford being lifted aloft by five Gladiators. Hammer has  my feet, Apollo my thighs, Nitro my bottom, Cyclone my shoulders and Dynamite is complaining there is nothing left of me to hold but my head. Nitro, the eldest of the group at 37, takes charge of art direction. “Extend your arm out like Cleopatra,” he instructs. I’m trying to breathe in while enjoying the moment, but Hammer keeps calling me Thunder – he had asked me just beforehand what my Gladiator name would be – and I’m struggling to keep it together.It’s all part of my mission to discover why Gladiators has recaptured the nation’s hearts and recreated the magic for a whole new generation. And if that means they have to pick me up so that I can test their strength, well, I’m here to serve.View image in fullscreenThe Catapult challenge in the original series …Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockView image in fullscreen… and new Gladiator Giant battling Sam Thompson in a celebrity special.Photograph: Graeme Hunter/BBC/Hungry Bear Media LtdSoon I’m sitting on a sofa with Apollo, all 6ft 6in of him squeezed into his red and blue unitard. With his floppy hair and smooth skin, Apollo looks as if he has aged out of a boyband, though he is in fact a former England rugby player andAmerican football tight end. There’s a touch of Alan Partridge to Apollo, real name Alex Gray. I ask how old he is and he says, “I’ve been 29 for the past five years.” His persona is of a nice guy with an arrogant edge. He recites poetry between challenges (self-penned, he assures me – “The new Shakespeare, they’re saying”) and pretends everyone fancies him.I ask him to introduce himself for the tape. He replies in verse: “I am the man of the hour, a guy too sweet to be sour, who guys want to be mates with, and girls want to go on dates with.” Guys don’t just want to be mates with you, Apollo! You’re a gay icon, I say. “Guilty,” he replies. “I‘ve got a lot of love from all sorts of different diverse communities, which has been fantastic. The gays, the mums, the teenage girls.”So, then, Apollo, are you single? As the words come out of my mouth, I realise I sound like a bit of a pervert. I plough on regardless. Is he on the celebrity dating app, Raya? He laughs and dodges the question. “I’m gonna be honest with you, I’ve probably never been more wanted in my life, but I’ve never been more cautious. There’s a responsibility that comes with being a Gladiator and I don’t take it lightly. You know, I love playing up to the myth of Apollo but at the same time I wanna be a decent person and when I’m not on the show, I like to keep out of trouble as much as I can.”After Gregg Wallace-gate and various Strictly scandals, the BBC cannot afford any whiff of controversy around another prime-time show. That’s why the Gladiators are drug tested each season. Giant, a man mountain with a ridiculous triangular torso, had to apologise last yearwhen a video emerged of himseemingly posting about taking steroids in his pre-Gladiator life as a bodybuilder (“Take this and you’ll get big,” he allegedly promised). He was supposed to be at the shoot but is too busy appearing in panto in Chesterfield (he’s in Jack and the Beanstalk, playing … the giant, of course).View image in fullscreen‘A man mountain with a ridiculous triangular torso’: Giant, AKA Jamie Christian-Johal.Photograph: David MacCormack/BBC/Hungry Bear Media LtdYou won’t catch the Gladiators falling out of nightclubs either, or falling prey to kiss’n’tells. Hammer – another 6ft 6-er, a champion indoor rower called Tom Wilson – looks like a bit of a lad, though I know full well he’s engaged because his fiance was sitting behind me at the Arena, where she politely but firmly refused to tell me whether Gladiators put the bins out. I tell him I like to imagine him out on the lash with Giant and Bionic, yet another 6ft 6in monolith who has bleached blond hair like an early career Gary Barlow. He insists that simply does not happen. “No, not at all. We like to just keep fit and stay away from anything like that really, because it affects your sleep, it affects your recovery and I think it’s important just to be super fit and super recovered and super rested,” he says.Part of Gladiators’ success is its appeal to young and old. Apollo pitches his lines at the adults in the audience, like when he fishes a mobile phone out of his Lycra in season two andseems to take a call after being beatenon the climbing wall. “Your mum says hello,” he shouts up to the victorious contender. He lets me into a secret. He hadn’t had the phone on him all the time. “As you can see,” he says, gesturing to his hot pants and making me blush, “there’s not enough room.”Each of the 18 Gladiators has a slightly different outfit to showcase their special powers or, in the case of Nitro’s scoop-necked number, their outrageous pecs. Five are made for each character each season and they are not allowed to keep them when they are not on duty. “They don’t trust me ’cause they know I would go down the shops in it,” Apollo says.Hammer is the only one who has a prop (it’s a hammer). He feigns outrage when I suggest he is only pretending it is heavy. “When you’re swinging that around, you sure know about it,” he insists. I am disappointed the hammer has not made it to the photoshoot but the PR says that would have been her job “and it’s 15kg, that thing”. Hammer is the viking of the group, with long dark locks that I’d heard were bulked out with hair extensions. He’s having none of it. “This is all mine,” he says, gesturing to the man bun he wears when he is not in character. Up close, I do detect a touch of Just For Men in his beard, though.View image in fullscreenOriginal referee John Anderson …Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockView image in fullscreen… and new boy Mark Clattenburg, with (from left) Viper, AKA Quang Luong, co-host Bradley Walsh and contender Finley Burkitt.Photograph: BBC/Hungry Bear Media LtdThe modern-day Gladiators make most of their money now as social media influencers, but 22-year-old Dynamite – CrossFit and weightlifting champion Emily Steel – is hoping for at least a side hustle in music. During the shoot she is writing lyrics for a duet with Apollo, who will apparently be contributing his poetry to the verses. Some of the original 90s Gladiators are still profiting from the show. Fabio, the Guardian photographer, tells me that this year alone he has donetwo shoots with Wolffor a German garage door company. Others have gone in an entirely different direction.Hunteris now a gong bath healer.It was the show’s producers who came up with the Gladiator characters, then cast them afterwards. Resident baddie Legend, AKA fitness influencer Matt Morsia, did not have to work hard to behave like an arrogant show-off. He vies with Viper – former model Quang Luong – as the reboot’s Wolf. When I watch the show in Sheffield, little children scream with equal terror and delight as Viper – who growls instead of speaks – rampages through the stands to rip up their posters.The biggest pat on the back we get is when families say, ‘You’ve brought us back together.’ It feels like I’m playing for EnglandNitro – former champion sprinter Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, who is probably the most famous of the current crop after his appearance on this year’s Strictly – recalls walking through a supermarket and being stopped by a little girl and her dad. “I said, ‘Who’s your favourite Gladiator?’ And the girl stopped and gave me a deep stare and said, ‘Viper.’ I asked why and she said, ‘Because he’s naughty!’ And I think to myself, that girl could probably have a few red flags in her life. But you know, if she likes him, she likes him. A little five-year-old, sweetest little thing, dressed in a pink dress.”Last year the producers decided they needed a female Gladiator with a dark side. The rest of the girls tend to play nicely and congratulate contenders who beat them, which sets a good example but can get a little dull. Bad losers are far more entertaining. Enter Cyclone, 24-year-old Irish powerlifterLystus Ebosele, who looks as if she wants to rip contestants’ heads off. I just love watching big strong women, especially at a time when so many women in the public eye are shrinking. It’s so refreshing to hear 5ft 10in Cyclone say she loves “taking up space” and eats as much as she can in the run-up to filming “so I can be massive”.View image in fullscreenNew Gladiators (from left) Apollo (Alex Gray), Dynamite (Emily Steel), Cyclone (Lystus Ebosele), Nitro (Harry Aikines-Aryeetey) and Hammer (Tom Wilson). Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian, assisted by Noah Lennon. Hair and makeup: Jennifer Gooding, assisted by Mandy Winrow. Location: Chief TV Studio, ManchesterI am fascinated by the Gladiators’ diets. Hammer starts his day with six eggs and “a bucket of porridge”, and gets through a kilo of rice every day, as well as three or four chicken breasts (his goal is to inhale 750g of protein daily). When they go out for dinner in Sheffield it’s chaos because so many of the Gladiators order two pizzas each. The whole time I interview Nitro he is stuffing Haribo in his mouth.Dynamite is the first to arrive at the shoot and boulders through the door asking what’s for lunch. (It’s 11am.) “I don’t want to be really skinny and break every time I get tackled on Powerball, you know. I want to be able to absolutely plough through contenders,” she says.I have always wanted to know whether the Gladiators are actually trying, especially on the Gauntlet, where contenders have to run through a corridor of huge gladiators wielding ramrods and power pads. Or Powerball, where the Gladiators rugby-tackle the contenders to stop them slamming balls into baskets. Some of the contenders are tiny. Size isn’t everything, Hammer says. “I’m always trying. They’re tricky sometimes, though. You gotta watch them. They can turn real quick. We’re massive, so we can’t turn as quickly. But I’m not going easy on no one.”At the filming in Sheffield I bump into Aneila Afsar, who came second in series two, and ask her whether she felt the Gladiators were always giving it 100%. On some of the games, yes, she says, such as Unleash, when a Gladiator is basically chasing a contender around an assault course. “But I think honestly, when it comes to things like Powerball, some of us would get flattened if they were really going 100%. I mean you’ve got people there like Fury, who played rugby for England, and Cyclone. I mean, I was one of the smaller contenders. I think if I’d been hit at 100% force, I probably wouldn’t have lasted very long. You’d have injured contestants left, right and centre, wouldn’t you?”View image in fullscreen‘Some of us would get flattened if they were really going 100%’: Aneila Afsar, the show’s first hijabi contender.Photograph: Graeme Hunter/BBC/Hungry Bear Media LtdGetting injured is an occupational hazard for the Gladiators, too. By the time the forthcoming series wrapped, Legend, Athena, Diamond and Bionic were all either on crutches or wearing slings. If any of those are your favourites, fear not: they’ll all be appearing throughout the series, just not necessarily in Lycra. At the taping we watch, Legend is sitting in the stands disguised as his own biggest fan for a sketch that had children (OK, and me) in hysterics.Afsar was the first ever hijabi to take part in the show. I love the diversity of Gladiators. Athena, powerlifter Karenjeet Kaur Bains, is Sikh. Fury is deaf. Viper is Chinese. Sabre is Scottish. There is a Gladiator for everyone – apart from, perhaps, the Welsh. Families of every hue fill the stands. There’s a timelessness to the spectacle. Mums shame themselves with lusty poster pitches (“You can spook me any time, Phantom!”), children rush to catch T-shirts shot into the audience with a cannon. If you’re ever thinking of watching Gladiators being filmed, I must warn you that it is an 11-hour day. But what a day. They let you in with a picnic and they only close the bar before the Eliminator.Bringing intergenerational joy is the best, Apollo says. “The biggest pat on the back we get is when we meet families and they say, ‘You’ve brought us back together … My kids didn’t want to watch anything with us, they’re stuck doing PlayStation or YouTube or whatever – this is the only thing they’ll sit down and watch with us.’Honestly, it’s amazing. It almost feels like I’m playing for England, it’s like the people’s show.”For me, Gladiators is the antidote to a cruel and senseless world. After being a reporter for 20 years, I’ve spent too much time in the darkness. Bring me sparkle! Bring me spandex! Bring me a gigantic Gladiator who can scoop me up and cradle me like a baby! I’ll paint you a poster if you make me a heart sign.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As fans celebratedvictory over the holders, Crystal Palace, many took their time to peel away from the stadium. Not too long ago, many feared they may never return to Moss Rose.Macclesfield Town FC, 1874-2020 was the etching on the gravestone of the club that died, mourned quietly by a town that had slowly lost touch with events at the shambling football ground on its southern tip, pretty much the last stop before the long drive to London begins.New outfits and snow disruption: inside Macclesfield before jackpot FA Cup tieRead moreSo ruinous were finances the old club, recently relegated from League Two after repeated points sanctions, waslost to the receivers in September 2020. Despair was heightened by the Covid pandemic restricting movement and football economics. The game’s authorities appeared uncaring, offering little but a shrugging response to a business going bad and paying the consequences. It would take sensible, if initially impulsive, business practice to create the phoenix club.Rob Smethurst is the local entrepreneur whobought Moss Rose’s fixtures and fittingsfrom the Rightmove website. Such a whim – a snap decision Smethurst, who has put in £4m, readily admits was taken while heavily under the influence – soon restored the club to its town. The 4G pitch that so troubled Crystal Palace on Saturday proved the crucial factor, allowing locals to train and play on the surface through the week, driving revenue.View image in fullscreenMacclesfield fans celebrate on the pitch at Moss Rose after their seismic FA Cup shock.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersIt brought the people back down London Road, as did gym facilities and a high-end bar where many fans gathered to watch Euro 2020 the following summer. On matchdays, with drinks allowed in view of the field at Macclesfield’s level, the club operates as a social club, a place to meet friends and make merry on a pitchside terrace serving quality produce.Robbie Savage, Smethurst’s close friend,served as a willing frontmanand hype man for five years, last season leading the club to the National League North as manager, his media profile bringing abouttwo BBC documentariesthat showed off those behind the scenes.This was, though, no vanity project but a collective mission. Many of those involved had been scarred by what happened to Town. When the former owner Amar Alkadhi was still around, operating as an absentee landlord, the Star Lane scoreboard bearing the legend “Amar Out” on Boxing Day 2019 spelled out what the majority thought.The old club, though it had two spells in the Football League, had a proud non-league history and those days were soon enough restored by Macclesfield FC with consecutive promotions, including last season’s under Savage.Macclesfield is not Wrexham, hand-picked by Hollywood execs to show off UK working-class folk and then paired with two American screen stars. Rumour has it the town was passed over for what became Disney’s Wrexham project because, being in Cheshire, and surrounded by villages that house the north-west’s footballer and stockbroker belts, it was too bourgeois. The town retains a tough, working-class edge, particularly in the area where the ground is situated. Open skies that reach up to the surrounding Peak District can make it an eerie place to visit.View image in fullscreenJohn Rooney, Macclesfield’s manager, stands by the memorial to the late Ethan McLeod  before the match against Crystal Palace.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/ShutterstockBeing adjacent to that elite football community had benefits beyond Savage’s involvement. Wayne Rooney, long resident nearby, occasionally took in games from the tiny main stand. His cousin Tommy Rooney even made a couple of appearances. On Saturday, the elder Rooney could not hold back the tears when his younger brother John masterminded the win over Palace, the younger sibling twice a Macc player who replaced Savage as manager.There was added poignancy, too, in players asked to shine in the face of losing a colleague and friend. It was on 16 December thatEthan McLeod, a 21-year-old striker, died in a car accidenton the M1. His parents were in the stands on Saturday as the Silkmen pulled off the victory John Rooney and Smethurst made sure todedicate to their son.If football is still the people’s game, then Macc’s rise from the ashes to a day of historic glory in the January sun may be the perfect embodiment of that.Explore more on these topicsFA CupMacclesfieldCrystal PalaceanalysisShareReuse this content"

This was a controlled, clinical performance from Liam Rosenior’s second string, who strolled into the fourth round of the FA Cup after a 5-1 win over a game but limitedCharlton Athletic, but once again the big talking point was the travelling support spewing venom in the direction of their unpopular owners.Dissatisfaction with the project is not going away.

The Brazilian winger is one of the best young players in the world and his runs were soon making Charlton’s defenders dizzy, but even signings like Estêvão have done little to sway the view of a fanbase united in opposition to an ownership almost four years in and still to convince naysayers that their unique vision will bring success.Charlton v Chelsea: FA Cup third round – liveRead moreIt has been a tough few weeks. Enzo Maresca’s departure was messy, his relationship with the board broken, leading sceptics to accuse Chelsea of becoming unmanageable. Rosenior, after all, is the fifth head coach since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital bought the club in 2022.The 41-year-old has signed a six-and-a-half-year deal but even the manner of his appointment was unusual, bearing in mind the sensitivities around BlueCo, the consortium that owns both Chelsea and Strasbourg, taking the Englishman away from the smaller club under its control with the season in full swing.Rosenior has had to hit back at the idea that he is a puppet for Chelsea’s owners. In the away end, though, the dissent started early. There were chants for Roman Abramovich in the first minute and it was not long before the travelling fans were spewing venom about Clearlake, the private equity firm with a major say in Chelsea’s trading model being controlled by a team of five sporting directors.Rosenior was aware of the unrest but did not want to dwell on it. “If your fans are happy it means you’re doing a good job,” he said. “This is a team that won the Club World Cup five months ago. We’re a good team.”Yet the jury certainly remains out on some of the squad building. Some of Chelsea’s problems this season have come after rotating, although Rosenior was never going to send out his strongest side with the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Arsenal to come on Wednesday. Cole Palmer and Reece James were rested and there were rare runouts in attack for Facundo Buonanotte, Jamie Gittens and Marc Guiu.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior saw his side pull away in the second half.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianA vocal presence on the touchline, Rosenior was happy with Buonanotte, Gittens, Guiu and Alejandro Garnacho. There was no great shift away from Maresca’s system. Chelsea dominated possession throughout the first half and were patient against a deep defence.Charlton, five points above the Championship’s bottom three after one win in their last six games, offered little. That the opening goal came from Jorrel Hato, though, was a reminder that this is a chance to turn over a new leaf. The 19-year-old was in for the suspended Marc Cucurella at left-back and looked eager to prove that Maresca was wrong to discard him after a nightmare display against Qarabag in November.Hato kept popping up in dangerous positions and eventually rammed a loose ball past Mannion to make it 1-0. Chelsea pushed for more at the start of the second half. It was 2-0 when the unmarked Tosin Adarabioyo glanced Buonanotte’s free-kick in at the near post.View image in fullscreenAn unmarked Tosin Adarabioyo guides a header goalwards and doubles Chelsea’s lead.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHowever, Rosenior must curb his side’s tendency to give away soft goals. Charlton had hope when Miles Leaburn capitalised on poor marking from a corner and halved the deficit in the 57th minute. “We need to improve,” Rosenior said. “They are the basics I talk about. I was disappointed to concede but our reaction was magnificent.”Chelsea responded when Garnacho drove in from the left, Buonanotte had a shot saved and Guiu collected his second goal of the season by turning the loose ball past Mannion.There was time for Pedro Neto to come on and drive in a fourth. Estevão then capped off a sparkling cameo by winning a penalty for Enzo Fernández, another of the substitutes, to score with the final kick of the game. But the resentment towards Clearlake lingered.Explore more on these topicsFA CupCharlton AthleticChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A performance that put an end to any realistic chance of a trophy fell well below the expectations of a furious crowd. That their opponents currently offer the diametric opposite of Tottenham’s dysfunction can only have heightened the sting.Goals from Emi Buendía and Morgan Rogers put this tie to bed for Villa in the first half, Wilson Odobert’s strike after half-time bringing a closeness to the scoreline that was not reflected in the general play. A scuffle on the field at the final whistle involving Rogers, João Palhinha and a host of Tottenham players only added further sourness to the occasion.Tottenham v Aston Villa: FA Cup third round – liveRead more“I think it was a good second half,” Frank said afterwards. “We played with energy passion and intensity, how we want to play. We scored a good goal and had other opportunities to get the equaliser, but couldn’t unfortunately. The first half was not as good, especially after the first goal and we couldn’t afford to concede the second.” Perhaps disconcertingly, Frank added: “We will definitely do everything we can to play two good halves.”Whether they were scared, demoralised or simply disengaged, Frank’s charges lacked assertiveness from the start. Nominally pressing their opponents high, it was all done at an arm’s remove, with barely a challenge made. Unlikely to win their duels against a snarling Villa side on the best of days, Spurs did not even try. Unai Emery’s men did not require an invitation to stomp all over their hosts and duly did so.View image in fullscreenMorgan Rogers points in delight after doubling Aston Villa’s lead.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersCharlton v Chelsea: FA Cup third round – liveRead moreWhen Villa opened the scoring, Boubacar Kamara had already been substituted after injuring his ankleafter a Palhinha challenge. Youri Tielemans came on and Villa’s mechanics continued to run smoothly. The Belgian played one of the three consecutive through balls that carved Tottenham open in the 22nd minute, but Donyell Malan applied the twist: flicking the ball into the path of Buendía who slammed a shot past Guglielmo Vicario. It was Buendía’s second goal against Spurs this season after deciding the Premier League fixture in October.Conceding didn’t change Tottenham’s outlook any. They had one moment of promise, from Xavi Simons, as he attempted to do by himself what Villa had achieved as a team, only for Randal Kolo Muani to be ruled offside after he finished Simons’s final ball. The rest was continued submission, and the loss of Richarlison once again to injury. The travelling fans regaled the stadium with rounds of “Tom Frank … is an Arsenal fan” in reference to the past week’s ‘cup gate’ and then, as five minutes of added time were about to be up, things got worse. Villa breezed their way into the Spurs box and a Buendía backheel found Rogers, the Villa talisman gobbling up the chance left-footed.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank shows his frustration during Tottenham’s FA Cup defeat.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images“To play like we did in first half was really fantastic, stopping them dominating with the ball, getting attacking threat in their third and scoring two goals,” Emery said. “I think we deserved to get this win. This club has won this trophy seven times and 9,000 supporters came with us today because they want to watch the team play to win. This is the responsibility we fight for.”After boos loud enough to be heard on the Seven Sisters road, Spurs returned early for the second half with a flea in their ear. Suddenly there was energy and endeavour, if not any clear patterns of play, and within 10 minutes they had a goal back,Odobert driving a low shot across the sprawling Marco Bizot for his first goal of the season, earning a roar from the Tottenham crowd.To be fair to Spurs they kept that endeavour up for another 15 minutes or so before Emery refreshed his troops and slowly sucked the energy out of any comeback. Tottenham fans had the brief succour of seeing Dominic Solanke make an appearance off the bench, his first minutes since the2-0 victory over Manchester Cityin August. But an equaliser never looked likely and, as the clock ran out, the crowd went quiet, saving their energy for a final chorus of catcalls.Explore more on these topicsFA CupTottenham HotspurAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Rayan Cherki’s pirouette presaged him threading the ball in behind Exeter’s defence for the wideman to run in and beat Joe Whitworth to cap a memorable display. A little later Semenyo was replaced to an ovation and, from his seat in the stands, the suspended Pep Guardiola, in a flat cap and winter coat, approved, too.Macclesfield pull off FA Cup’s greatest shock by knocking out holders Crystal PalaceRead moreTijjani Reijnders’ curled finish, Nico O’Reilly’s flicked header, an 18-yard shot by another debutant, Ryan McAidoo, and Rico Lewis’s second completed City’s goal-plunder, while the substitute George Birch, 19, smashed home a memorable first Exeter goal for their consolation.Pep Lijnders, who replaced Guardiola on the touchline, said: “Antoine is settling well, he’s a humble guy. He brings something to the front line, what we really need. He can attack quickly, wants to chase, he’s a guy who doesn’t stop. You see today that he can adapt quite quickly to our style.”City are at Newcastle for Tuesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg. “We want to reach the finals this year,” said Lijnders. “We play the semi-final for the League Cup. We go a round further in theFA Cupand are in the Champions League in a good position.”Lijnders was asked if Guardiola relayed instructions from his vantage point. “What do you think?” he said.As he sought, at the fourth attempt, to win a first game of 2026, Guardiola sent out an XI that included Rodri, Erling Haaland, Cherki, Nathan Aké and the two debutants: the right-back, McAidoo, 17, and the £62.5m man, Semenyo, who operated on the left.View image in fullscreenMax Alleyne (second left) watches his shot give Manchester City the lead.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAExeter, 14th in League One and unbeaten in their past three games, had never faced City in their 125-year history. They started like a train – Jayden Wareham roved in, shot, and James Trafford tipped over for a corner. This came in from the right and Trafford’s reflexes again saved City, the goalkeeper palming Liam Oakes’s header away.Lijnders had a smirk for Gary Caldwell when Exeter’s manager complained to the fourth official, Sam Mulhall, about a corner claimed by Lewis. The Dutchman was far happier when Max Alleyne prodded the opener home. McAidoo, a bright presence, scooped in a cross. Near goal, Aké headed to Haaland, he tapped the ball to Abdukodir Khusanov, who rolled it across, Jack Fitzwater hashed the clearance and the 20-year-old Alleyne, on his second City appearance, scored.Caldwell deployed a 5-4-1 that had to prosper from scant possession. After Wareham nicked the ball near halfway, play went right then left, but Jack Aitchison was flagged offside.Semenyo took out a page advert in the local newspaper to thank Bournemouth fans after his three years there, which was as classy as the raking pass that allowed Reijnders to bob and weave in the Grecians’ area. The 26-year-old’s next contribution was an inadvertent assist. His effort cannoned back to Rodri and the Spaniard fired a missile beyond the diving and helpless Whitworth, low into the keeper’s right corner.Already Exeter were a raggedy bunch, chasing blue shirts about as if dazed and befuddled. Semenyo hit an instant pass to Haaland, he shot, Whitworth parried the ball across the area and Cherki’s dummy was bought by Luca Woodhouse, who felled the Frenchman. Adam Herczeg ruled no penalty, which appeared a wrong decision, but with no video assistant referee the decision was final.By half-time City led 4-0. The hapless Fitzwater headed Cherki’s corner from the left against Aké and the ball bounced in. Then Reijnders’ cross from the left was turned past Whitworth by Fitzwater, whose afternoon was becoming a nightmare.View image in fullscreenGeorge Birch scores for Exeter, making it 9-1 – but Rico Lewis had the last word.Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersBefore this, Ilmari Niskanen broke through from right wing-back but steered his effort wide, so Exeter wandered off for the interval staring at a serious hiding.Haaland, Aké and Rodri were replaced by Divine Mukasa, Stephen Mfuni and O’Reilly, and City continued on. Semenyo this time curved a cross over from the left and Lewis’s volley gave Whitworth no chance.Further City goals came for Semenyo, Reijnders, O’Reilly, McAidoo and, after Birch’s, Lewis, as Exeter were imperiously swatted aside by Guardiola’s ruthless unit. Caldwell said: “When the team sheet came in, it was an experience we didn’t envisage.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupManchester CityExeter Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We talked a lot and openly about her future, and when she told us that she now wanted to try something new, her reasons were completely understandable.”Stanway posted on social media that she had made lifelong friends at the German club and told the club: “I will give everything for the club and its sporting success until my very last day, just as I have for the past three and a half years. And I want to say goodbye to the club and the fans at the end of the season with as many titles as possible.”Aston Villa are set to sign the France midfielder Oriane Jean-François from Chelsea for £450,000 in a club-record fee for a sale by the London side. It is understood that the deal is agreed and the 24-year-old’s move should be finalised in the coming days.

You cannot tell a story without in some way editing it, reducing it, compressing it. Which means that anybody telling a story about a historical event, particularly one from the relatively recent past, risks outraging those who have studied it or who remember it. Often those complaints are pedantic, trivial, but sometimes they are not. It’s one thing to elide two minor characters or to tweak the timeline to simplify a story, quite another to imply misleading motivations.Saipan, Glenn Leyburn’s and Lisa Barros D’Sa’s film about the cataclysmic row between Roy Keane and Mick McCarthy shortly before the 2002 World Cup, came out in Ireland on Boxing Day and will be released in the UK on 23 January. It is obsessed by detail: the tracksuits, the sweatshirts, the kits are all right. It’s startling when the film cuts between reproductions of interviews and press conferences and actual footage to realise just how accurately these scenes have been recreated. Which raises two questions. What is the point? And how can such care have been taken over the look of the film when there are such grotesque inventions and inaccuracies in the plotting and motivation?Fra Filippo Lippi was a 15-century Florentine painter noted for the realism of his depictions of religious scenes. Go to the Uffizi and compare, for instance, hisMadonna with Child and Two Angelswith the work around it and you can see why he had such an impact. There is a delicacy and a precision, a spontaneity and humanity, that set him apart from his contemporaries (and his son). It’s that realism Robert Browning picks up on in his dramatic monologue in which he imagines Lippi arguing with a critic who objects: “Nature is complete:/Suppose you reproduce her – (which you can’t)/There’s no advantage! you must beat her, then.” Browning’s Lippi replies: “We’re made so that we love/First when we see them painted, things we have passed/Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see,” and concludes: “Art was given for that.”And perhaps in painting, or sculpture or even literature, that is true. Part of the joy of great art is that it highlights the beauty of the everyday. But there is also pleasure to be taken from the technical skill required in mimetic reproduction. Lippi’s work is lighter, less formulaic, more alive than that of his contemporaries. Which is where photography presented a challenge to painting.John William Inchbold’s mid-19th-century depictions of woodland scenes are startling in their detail and the subtlety of the lighting but, inevitably, they’re less realistic than a snap a child could take on their phone. And that in part explains the move, later in the century, with the Impressionists and their successors, towards something less realistic, something that tries to capture an inner spirit, an energy, or the movement of light.View image in fullscreenMick McCarthy (right) and Roy Keane during  a Republic of Ireland training session in Saipan.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PAFilm is perhaps now facing a similar challenge. Just as realist painters delighted in reflecting back the world, so it makes sense for filmmakers to depict great historical scenes: here is Julius Caesar being stabbed in the forum, here is Alexander Nevsky leading his troops across the frozen Lake Chudskoe. Here is Winston Churchill delivering a rousing address to the Commons. But that seems a little less necessary when the event being depicted was filmed at the time.And it seems a particularly odd exercise when the event being depicted was specifically staged for the cameras. What do we gain by seeing Steve Coogan doing an impression of McCarthy in a post-match press conference when the press conference was filmed and the footage exists? The only logic is to maintain continuity for the scenes for which we don’t have footage, of which the most important in Saipan is, of course, the climactic “stick it up your bollocks” tirade in the hotel restaurant. But that scene is itself problematic.Accounts of exactly what was said vary but everybody who was there agrees that Keane did not attack McCarthy for being insufficiently Irish, as he does in the film. The two players who went to Keane afterwards in sympathy, Gary Breen and David Connolly, were born in England (as were nine others in that squad). To set this up as some sort of Anglo-Irish dispute is untrue, misleading and, frankly, lazy.Coogan’s portrayal of McCarthy is generally fine, even if there is an alarming moment when it seems as if Jimmy Savile is celebrating an Ireland goal.Éanna Hardwicke is excellent as Keane. But when this was filmed, Coogan was 16 years older than McCarthy was in Saipan. He is also three inches shorter than Hardwicke, whereas McCarthy is three inches taller than Keane. That changes the dynamic significantly. Rather than a man of 30 shouting at a physically imposing man one generation older, the scene in the restaurant becomes a young, hyper-fit, extremely intense athlete berating a shorter man nearly 30 years his senior. And whatever the merits of his argument, that just looks like bullying.Perhaps that’s primarily an aesthetic concern, the quibble of a journalist who has spent significant time in the presence of McCarthy and Keane. But it’s fundamental, because it calls into question the whole point of the exercise. Why is this a drama rather than a documentary? What, other than an uneven tone, is gained by the dramatised scenes?We see McCarthy doing odd jobs at home. We hear an expletive-laden phone call with Alex Ferguson. We witness almost cartoonish shenanigans at the training camp: the Football Association of Ireland executives and the majority of the players portrayed as perennially drunk. But that broad-brush, exaggerated comedy sits awkwardly alongside the more nuanced portrayal of Keane – not that it is nuanced enough to begin to penetrate what drives him. In the world of the film, his fury at the unprofessional shambles he has to deal with is the only reasonable response; the reality was far less straightforward.View image in fullscreenRoy Keane, as portrayed by Éanna Hardwicke, is the centre of attention in Saipan.Photograph: Aidan Monaghan/PAShifting Keane’s rant about the fact that Ireland are refuelling not with pasta and salad but cheese sandwiches from the qualifier against the Netherlands to Saipan is justifiable. It’s a good story and it exemplifies his concerns. Other changes, though, are less justifiable. Keane’s explosive interview with the Irish Times is depicted as a betrayal, a journalist printing the story not after the tournament as agreed but the day before they left Saipan for Japan. That simply isn’t true, and lessens Keane’s culpability.The most engaging moments of Saipan are the contemporary clips. In part it’s the texture that provides: the familiar voices ofBill O’Herlihy, Eamon Dunphy and Tony O’Donoghue, RTÉ’s evident excitement at speaking via a sat-phone despite the dreadful picture quality, and the sadness and bitterness in the phone-ins: this really was a subject that split the nation. The problem is that, other than one montage that briefly references the booming Irish economy, there is no real indication as to why the issue was so divisive, the way in which Keane was perceived by many as representing the new thrusting Ireland of the Celtic Tiger and McCarthy the lovable but shambolic past. This wasn’t just about an angry man shouting at an old bloke; it was about Ireland.Perhaps achieving that in drama is difficult, particularly given it’s not an uncomplicated issue: Keane is not simply some avatar of “progress”. You don’t want Steven Reid and Jason McAteer – two of the handful of named other players in the film; neither come out of it well – discussing the state of the nation as they lounge by the pool. The faithfulness of the recreations are admirable but, by the end, those scenes feel almost an aesthetic experiment in the manner of Gus Van Sant’s scene-by-scene remake of Psycho.And so you end up, like Browning’s imagined critic of Lippi, muttering about the futility of mimetic reproduction. This is not like seeing a doting mother and baby in the street, then marvelling at how accurately that has been reproduced in paint on canvas in a gallery. This is seeing something that happened on film, that for the vast majority of people was first experienced on a screen, reproduced in film on a screen.This is not like Frost/Nixon, The Damned United or even Coogan’s turn as Brian Walden in Brian and Maggie, each of which features the reproduction of a key interview, because in each of those examples, the interview is part of a greater whole. Here, beyond stick-it-up-your-bollocks, there isn’t much else – and what there is takes some highly questionable liberties with what actually happened. And where there are conflicting views, better surely to present both than to offer the consolation of a simple dramatised narrative that is not merely not true, but is rather less interesting than the reality.Explore more on these topicsRepublic of IrelandInside footballRoy KeaneMick McCarthyWorld Cup 2002commentShareReuse this content"

The Egyptians had little possession at the Grande Stade Agadir but took their chances with clinical precision and held on to book a semi-final with Senegal on Wednesday.An own goal from Ahmed Fatouh and a late effort by Guéla Doué proved insufficient for Côte d’Ivoire, winners of the tournament on home soil two years ago but now deposed as African champions.Morocco sail into Afcon semi-finals as Díaz sparks fine win over CameroonRead moreEgypt, who have won a record seven titles, wasted little time in taking the lead as Marmoush scored in the fourth minute after Hamdi Fathy won the ball from Franck Kessie in the midfield, allowing Emam Ashour to thread a pinpoint pass to the sprinting Marmoush. He still needed to shrug off the attentions of defender Odilon Kossounou before slotting home.It quickly became clear the Ivorians were going to dominate possession, showing much more physical strength on the ball but without setting up clear chances. Egypt went 2-0 up in the 32nd minute when Rabia rose above the defenders to head his side further ahead from a corner. Côte d’Ivoire reduced the deficit eight minutes later when teenager Yann Diomande’s free-kick near the corner took a slight brush off Kossounou’s head and ricocheted off the knee of full back Fatouh and into the net.The Ivorians had come from 2-0 down to beat Gabon 3-2 earlier in the tournament but hopes of turning the scoreline around soon after the restart were stymied by a simply created, but superbly finished, goal for Salah seven minutes after the break. Rabia was well inside his own half when he chipped the ball over the top of the Ivorian defensive line, allowing Ashour to run on to it and hit an accurate pass with the outside of his right boot into the path of Salah to score.An Ivorian comeback was still on when Doué touched home at the end of a goalmouth scramble in the 73rd minute. That set up a siege of the Egyptian goal in the final 15 minutes but they held out to advance.Nigeria, who have reached the last four 17 times in the last 20 tournaments they have qualified for, will take on Morocco in Rabat in the semi-finals on Wednesday after their win over Algeria.Osimhen steered home a long cross from the left by Bruno Onyemaechi two minutes into the second half as Algeria’s goalkeeper Luca Zidane made a bizarre jump to try to stop the effort but ended up getting his angles wrong and conceding an easy goal.Adams increased Nigeria’s lead 10 minutes later as Osimhen unselfishly fed him the ball and he took it round Zidane before placing it into an empty net. It was an impressive performance by Nigeria, who missed out on World Cup qualification two months ago, as they overwhelmed their opponents from the start at the Grand Stade de Marrakech. Nigeria looked more determined, quicker around the field and stronger in the challenges, denying their opponents a single scoring chance.Algeria had been forced to play extra time before winning their last-16 clash against the Democratic Republic of Congo on Tuesday and the exertion could have been the reason many of their key players turned in listless performances. In contrast, Nigeria had a comfortable 4-0 win over Mozambique on Monday.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Nigeria football teamAlgeria football teamEgypt football teamCôte d’Ivoire football teamAfrica Cup of NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a big kick in the teeth for everyone, the owners, the poor girl who looks after him – you hate to see that happen. He was just showing his class today, he jumped and travelled well and sadly now he will never be able to show the potential we thought he had.“I can say as much as I like, but it’s just a shame for the whole team. Harry was extremely upset and is missing his ride in the last as he doesn’t feel great about it. He’s a big, bold horse who attacks his fences and those horses, when they do that, can end up having a bad fall.“He was enthusiastic today and travelling beautifully and we’ll never know where we would have ended up, we’ve always had a lot of faith in him. These things happen, sadly, and we’ll have to try to pick ourselves up and move forward. These horses get the best of everything, there’s not much you can say to make it better at this point.“It never gets any easier when these things happen and it’s a big old blow.”In the Coral Daily Rewards Shaker Handicap Chase, Jonjo and AJ O’Neill’s Peso was pulled up on the flat with an injury that could not be treated, leaving racecourse vets with no choice but to euthanise him.Harry Derham saddled Wertpol for the juvenile hurdle and the horse looked to be running a huge race before falling at the last and sustaining a life-ending injury. Derham said on his X account: “An utterly miserable day at Kempton Park today losing Wertpol who we only had the good fortune of having in our yard for a short period of time.View image in fullscreen‘It’s a sad day when you lose horses like that, it’s hard on the whole team.

He loved his job and I am so sad for his Heart Of The South syndicate, who are the most wonderful group of people. Racing can at times be a painful sport and today has been a tough day for a number of connections. A day to forget.”A spokesperson for Kempton Park said: “All of us at Kempton Park care deeply about the welfare of all racehorses, as do the thousands of racing staff who provide them with world-class levels of care at home every day. Our heartfelt condolences are with the connections of all three horses.”A starement from the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) said:“Our thoughts are with the connections of the horses, including the owners, trainers and the racing grooms, who looked after and cared for them throughout their lives and will be most affected by their loss …“The BHA will now analyse each of the incidents in detail through our fatality review process. This involves an in-depth review into every fatality that occurs on a raceday, with input from experts including veterinarians, racecourse teams and participants.“At this stage there does not appear to be any common factor that can be attributed to these incidents, with each of the injuries different in nature and sustained in unique circumstances.“But as is the case where there is more than one fatality at a single race meeting, the BHA will also initiate its additional review process to assess all relevant factors in conjunction with the racecourse and determine whether there may be any causal links. These processes are part of wider and ongoing efforts across British racing to continually improve safety and reduce avoidable risk of injuries and fatalities.”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingAnimal welfarenewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve found myself in dozens of countries working with activists, politicians and civil servants to untangle the complex technical questions raised by the internet, andevery one of our discussions ended in the same place. “OK,” they’d say, “you’ve definitely laid out the best way to regulate tech, but we can’t do it.”Why not? Because – inevitably – the US trade rep had beaten me to every one of those countries and made it eye-wateringly clear that if they regulated tech in a way that favoured their own people, industries and national interests, the US wouldbury them in tariffs.But deterrents are a funny thing. If someone demands that you follow their orders or they’ll burn your house down, so you do, and they burn your house down anyway … well, you’re a bit of a fool if you keep on doing what they tell you, aren’t you?Donald Trump’s tariffshave opened up a new possibility for the technology we have become increasingly dependent on. Today, nearly all of our tech comes from US companies, and it arrives as aprix fixemeal. If you want to talk with your friends on a Meta platform, you have to let Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg eavesdrop on your conversations. If you want to have a phone that works, you have to let Apple’s Tim Cook suck30p out of every poundyou spend and give him a veto over which software you can run. If you want to search the web, you have to let Google’s Sundar Pichai know what colour underwear you’ve got on.This is a genuinely odd place for digital computers to have got to. Every computer in your life, from your mobile phone to your smart speaker to your laptop to your TV, is theoretically capable of runningallprogrammes, including the ones the manufacturers would really prefer you stay away from. This means that there are noprix fixemenus in technology – everything can be had à la carte. Thanks to the infinite flexibility of computers, every 10-foot fence a US tech boss installs in a digital product you rely on invites a programmer to supply you with a four-metre ladder so you can scamper nimbly over it. However, we adopted laws – at the insistence of the US trade rep – that prohibit programmers from helping you alter the devices you own, in legal ways, if the manufacturer objects. This is one thing that leads to what I refer to as theenshittificationof technology.There is only one reason the world isn’t bursting with wildly profitable products and projects thatdisenshittifythe US’s defective products: its (former) trading partners were bullied into passingan “anti-circumvention” lawthat bans the kind of reverse-engineering that is the necessary prelude to modifying an existing product to make it work better for its users (at the expense of its manufacturer). But the Trump tariffs change all that. The old bargain – put your own tech sector in chains, expose your people to our plunder of their data and cash, and in return, the US won’t tariff your exports – is dead.This means digital rights activists who’ve been trying to get rid of the “anti-circumvention” laws have a new potential ally: investors and technologists who’d like to make ahell of a lot of moneyraiding the margins of the most profitable lines of business of the most profitable companies the world has seen.In the UK, reverse engineering is restricted underarticle 6of the European software directive of 2001. US companies have capitalised on this fact – that British companies cannot modify their products – to spy on us and whack us with sky-high fees. Now, post-Brexit, the UK is uniquely able to seize this moment. Unlike our European cousins, we needn’t wait for the copyright directive to be repealed before we can strike article 6 off our own law books and thereby salvage something good out of Brexit.What’s more, this is a proven business. US tech platforms extract hundreds of billions in rents and junk fees from all over the world. As Jeff Bezos told publishers when he founded Amazon: “Your margin is my opportunity.” Why shouldn’t we move fast and breakJeff’sthings?Makinghundreds of billions of dollars every year is a far superior course of action to building a bunch of datacentres in support of an AI sector that islosingbillions of dollars every year and heading for a tremendous crash, and we can do it without destroying what’s left of our water supply and crashing our creaking power grid. There are plenty of technologists who have been forcibly ejected from the US and would jump at the chance to drain their former employers’ billions. There’s also plenty of investors looking for a business opportunity whose success doesn’t hinge on how many$TRUMP coinsthey buy.It’s not just digital rights activists, investors and entrepreneurs who have a dog in this fight. Now that Trump has made it clear that the US no longer has allies or trading partners, only rivals and adversaries, everyone in the world is trying to figure out whether they can trust American tech infrastructure with their governments, businesses and personal data.The answer is a resounding “no”. Just look at the international criminal court, which ditched Microsoft Office for a European alternative after Trump sanctioned its officials for issuing an arrest warrant for thegénocidaireBenjamin Netanyahu. Directly after Trump denounced the court, its justices lost access to all their Microsoft accounts – emails, documents, calendar, address book. The court was, in effect, “bricked”. Microsoft denies this, but between the justices of the international criminal court and the US tech monopolist, I know who I trust.Trump is capable of weaponising the US’s tech companies, and there’s no telling where it will end. Remember that when Russianlooters stole millionsof dollars’ worth of John Deere tractors and spirited them away to Chechnya, the company was able to push a kill signal to the tractors that rendered them inoperable.Until we repeal the anti-circumvention law, we can’t reverse-engineer the US’s cloud software, whether it’s a database, a word processor or a tractor, in order to swap out proprietary, American code for robust, open, auditable alternatives that will safeguard our digital sovereignty. The same goes for any technology tethered to servers operated by any government that might have interests adverse to ours – say, the solar inverters and batteries we buy from China.This is the state of play at the dawn of 2026. The digital rights movement has two powerful potential coalition partners in the fight to reclaim the right of people to change how their devices work, to claw back privacy and a fair deal from tech: investors and national security hawks.Admittedly, the door is only open a crack, but it’s been locked tight since the turn of the century. When it comes to a better technology future, “open a crack” is the most exciting proposition I’ve heard in decades.Cory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist and journalist.

Is the ‘family values’ party listening?Sat 10 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 09.01 ESTShareWhat arealpro-family agenda looks likeI think we all need a little cheering up, don’t you? So allow me to interrupt the steady stream ofviolent authoritarianismand state-sponsored murder in your feed with some good news. New York City, which already provides free preschool for three- and four-year-olds, is a step closer to providing free universal childcare for two-year-olds. On Thursday, Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Zohran Mamdaniannounced a planfor the free childcare program, which they said will start by focusing on “high-need areas” and then gradually expand to cover the city. The mayor said he expected about 2,000 children to be covered by the program this fall.There are still a lot of questions about how the universal childcare program will be funded long-term and how exactly it will be rolled out. Nevertheless, even though it’s still in a very early stage, there’s a lot to celebrate here.First, there’s the fact that, not even two weeks into his role as mayor, Mamdani seems to be doing all he can to fulfil his bold campaign promises and affordability agenda. Most importantly, he’s shown he can work with the state governor, who has made it quite clear she is not hisbiggest fan, to get things done.America’s most crucial political faultline is in New York City | John R MacArthurRead more“To those who think that the promises of a campaign cannot survive once confronted with the realities of government, today is your answer,” Mamdani said at the event on Thursday.I hope that pro-natalists and representatives of the so-called “party of family values” are paying attention here. Sorry to state the bleeding obvious, but if you want people to have more kids, then this is how you do it. You don’t do it by making condoms more expensive (hello, China) or by removing access to safe and legal abortions (hello, USA) or by saying grandparents, not daycares, should be watching little kids (hello,JD Vance). Rather, you make it more affordable for people to have children. If you want to be a party of family values, you do that by actually helping young children thrive – not byseparating migrant families.I also hope that Democratic politicians are paying attention. Turns out that you can, in fact, aim high! You can, in fact, get things done! You don’t need to tell Republicans this, by the way. They are very good at having bold (albeit dystopian) ambitions and getting things done. Donald Trumpjust toldthe New York Times that the only limits on his power are his “own morality” and his “own mind”. I’m not condoning this, obviously! Still, nobody could accuse the Trump administration of not thinking big.Meanwhile the Democrats continually think small. They need to raise a few billion from you every election cycle so they can hire some highly paid consultants to create taskforces and policy papers and PowerPoint decks, which all conclude, regrettably, that nothing good can ever happen. Abandon your childish idealism because they, the “moderates” and the adults in the room, have decided that a better world just isn’t realistic. Still, make sure you vote blue no matter who (unless it’s a democratic socialist), because the other people are worse.“In writing this address, I have been told that this is the occasion to reset expectations, that I should use this opportunity to encourage the people of New York to ask for little and expect even less,” Mamdani said in hisinaugural address. “I will do no such thing. The only expectation I seek to reset is that of small expectations. We may not always succeed. But never will we be accused of lacking the courage to try.”Amen to that. We should all expect more from our politicians – who routinely seem to forget that they work for us, not a select few billionaires. Things seem hopeless at the moment, but we must continue to have the courage to try to fight for a better world.And now, after that moment of radical optimism, back to our regularly scheduled programming of doom and gloom.Stephen Miller continues to be a creepy little weirdoThe White House deputy chief of staff is probably the most influential, andmost dangerous, man in the Trump administration. The far-rightdeportation enthusiastwas thechief architectof the family separation and Muslim ban policies during Trump 1.0. Now he seems to be encouraging the administration to conquer the world with force. Along with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, Miller was akeypart of Trump deciding to kidnap the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro. “We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else,” Millertold CNN’s Jake Tapperon Monday. “But we live in a world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.” Expect more shows of force and power from this wannabe strongman.

As reported by the Guardian, Trinity Hall justified the move by claiming that a focus only on “greater fairness in admissions” could “unintentionally result in reverse discrimination”. Alumni LinkedIn feeds and social media threads quickly filled with outrage, as many Cambridge graduates interpreted the move as class prejudice rearing its ugly head once again. One angry fellow at the college said it amounted to a “slap in the face” for their state-educated undergraduates.It brought back memories of the sneering snobbery at Oxford when the former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, then principal of Lady Margaret Hall, introduced a new foundation year. “We don’t do hard luck stories,”sniffed one academic. “Oxford doesn’t do remedial education,” complained another. The foundation year at Oxford and also at Cambridge has since enjoyed huge success, proving that students who have faced great adversity or academic disadvantage can flourish when given the chance.The words “reverse discrimination” are jarring. Whatever the intentions behind Trinity Hall’s policy, singling out a tiny cadre of already highly resourced schools sends a powerful signal: that academic quality is most reliably found there, and moving beyond this clique risks lowering standards. In a society marked by extreme inequalities in wealth, schooling and opportunity, the claim that these institutions are the victims of discrimination would be difficult to sustain – even by the cleverest of Cambridge dons.For others, this is a classic case of what the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu would term “misrecognition”: mistaking polished performance and extra preparation, which is so often shaped by privilege, for greater underlying talent – and sincerely believing this to be fair. The furore centres on recruitment for a handful of places in subjects such as music, classics and modern languages, which are prey to the most gaping of educational disparities. Many state schools simply cannot offer them in depth, if at all. Access to musical instruments, orchestras, private tuition, Latin or Greek and overseas travel has remained a privilege rather than a universal opportunity. To treat these unequal starting points as evidence of unequal ability is to mistake years of private rehearsal for natural merit.It is little surprise that battles over talent are intensifying at a time of declining levels of social mobility, widening wealth divides and an increasingly detached and powerful elite. Yet the profound generational opportunity divides we face seem beyond the scope of today’s politicians, many of whom would not now dare name, let alone challenge, a class system in which advantage and power are being systemically hoarded by elites.In a world of spiralling living costs, and even despite thegraduate jobs crisis, a coveted place at a top-tier university is still the golden ticket to the high-status jobs that can transform lives. For the vast majority of the population lacking serious wealth, it is one of the few routes left to the highly paid careers that may allow you to one day buy your own home – a diminishing prospect for generations growing up today.The dials of opportunity are all pointing in the wrong direction – not least the gap in elite university enrolments between private and state schools. In truth, the most persistent admissions gap at Oxbridge is between a tiny cadre of top schools and the rest. In 2011, a Sutton Trust study found thatfour private schools and one sixth-form collegesent more pupils to Oxford and Cambridge over three years than 2,000 schools and colleges across the UK. In 2018,a follow-up studyconcluded “little had changed”. Since then, there has been some progress on admissions statistics, but recent data shows regress at Cambridge – with the university scrapping targets for state school admissions in 2024, under a policy imposed by the Office for Students.As Trinity Hall’s policy itself acknowledges, securing greater fairness in admissions is a crucial task. Universities would do well to look to some of the world’s top global companies, which are now ahead of the curve in the talent game. In my work with leading employers, from law firms to banks, professional services and tech companies, I’m seeing a decisive shift away from blunt diversity drives towards a more forensic examination of what talent looks like. Many diversity efforts have defaulted to identity tick-boxes, leaving untouched the class-based workplace practices that determine who is recognised as talented and who gets ahead.This is the hard business case for social mobility: disentangling which traits genuinely drive performance and which are simply learned behaviours associated with privileged upbringing. In my book Cracking the Class Codes, co-authored with Anne-Marie Sim, out later this year, we set out the cultural markers that operate as hidden signals of talent and belonging in elite firms and universities. Confidence in interviews, fluency in abstract discussion, ease in challenging authority: these traits feel natural to those who possess them and are easily mistaken for innate ability. In reality, they are the accumulated product of years of advantage. This is about making expectations explicit, transparent and teachable for all employees, rather than leaving them as tacit codes benefiting a fortunate few.Prestigious universities face exactly the same challenge. They can continue to select students already trained to succeed in their existing environments, or they can do the harder work of asking whether their environments themselves need to change to nurture all talents.Doubtless, there is a case for making social class a legally protected characteristic, forcing institutions to confront discrimination more directly. But universities already have it within their power to design admissions systems that reward talent, irrespective of background. The test of a great university is not whether it attracts those already trained to succeed, but whether it can recognise and cultivate potential wherever it exists. At a time of deepening opportunity divides, that distinction has never mattered more.Lee Elliot Major is a professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter.

Your response has been characteristically generous. So far we have together raised an incredible £900,000. You told us this was for many of you a topical and important issue close to your hearts.It is not too late togive to the appeal, which closes at midnight on Wednesday evening. I’d like to thank the thousands of readers who have donated so far, and offer my gratitude in advance to those whom we hope we can still persuade to contribute.Your generous donations will be shared among our five 2025 charityappeal partners: Citizens UK, the Linking Network, Locality, Hope Unlimited Charitable Trust, and Who Is Your Neighbour?We’ve highlighted in recent weeks some of the brilliant work they deliver or support, from Father Chris Hughes’s inspiring“Walk of Hope”in North Shields to Salaam Shalom Kitchen’s groundbreaking joint Muslim-Jewishfood projectin Nottingham, to 174 Trust’srevelatory“dining across the divides” initiative in Belfast.The Linking Network’s joyfulschools matchingschemes bring together children of different faiths, cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds to explore what they have in common. Who Is Your Neighbour?’s innovative“difficult conversations”around race and immigration are grounded in the core belief that empathy builds empathy.Back on the Map’simpressive revitalisationof a Sunderland neighbourhood in the wake of the 2024 riots suggests political attempts to sow grievance and division can be countered by local enterprise, tolerance, pride and solidarity. At the grassroots, its chief executive, Joanne Cooper, told us, “people do care about each other”.Your donations will make a positive difference. Locality and Hope Unlimited Charitable Trust will regrant much of their share of donations to local organisations doing essential work to nurture that pride and solidarity, providing an antidote to distrust, intolerance and hate.The Linking Network and Who Is Your Neighbour? will use their shares to develop and expand their pioneering work.

Small states that stray into great-power conflicts rarely emerge unscathed. They are not players; they are expendables.It’s a statement that frames the reality of where Trinidad and Tobago sits uneasily today.For small states, geopolitics is not a theatre for bravado but a discipline of diplomacy and survival. That discipline has now collapsed. Trinidad and Tobago will pay the price of auctioning off its sovereignty to its neocolonial master, the US. The nation now sits dangerously exposed, economically, diplomatically, and potentially militarily, after theUS attack on Venezuelaand the extraordinary kidnapping of its president, Nicolás Maduro.With Delcy Rodríguez now installed as Venezuela’s president andDiosdado Cabellostill embedded, the Maduro regime remains largely intact. Trinidad and Tobago now faces an openly hostile neighbour whose senior leadership has denounced the dual island state’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, as a complicit enabler of US aggression and designated her persona non grata. This is not misfortune. It is the price of strategic misjudgment.This crisis did not arrive overnight. Through rhetorical excess, Persad-Bissessar has steadily narrowed our country’s room for manoeuvre. What is now unfolding is the predictable outcome of decades of amateurish improvisation masquerading as governance. Successive administrations have failed to articulate a coherent foreign policy for what was once the wealthiest country in the Caribbean.For small states, the cardinal sin is not choosing the “wrong” side but collapsing strategic ambiguity. That is precisely what Trinidad and Tobago did. Persad-Bissessar boxed her country in. Her public alignment with Washington’s racist dictator in chief, combined withdisparaging remarks toward respected Caribbean leadersand a casual dismissal of regional diplomacy and historic ties, has left Trinidad and Tobago isolated at precisely the moment when geopolitical flexibility was necessary.After the action in Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago finds itself isolated from one of its largest trading partnersDuring her earlier term, memorably declaring thatTrinidad and Tobago was “not the ATM of the Caribbean”, Persad-Bissessar signalled to our Caribbean community (Caricom) that regional solidarity was conditional and transactional. Yet Caricom is not a marketplace; it is a family. Disagreements are inevitable, but they are meant to be managed privately, with a public posture of unity that small states depend on for collective strength and survival.Today, the cost of that posture is coming due. After the action inVenezuela, Trinidad and Tobago finds itself isolated from one of its largest trading partners. Across the region, calls for boycotts have begun circulating. Leadership in geopolitics is not about sounding tough or forcing false choices. On that test, this administration has failed.This is not a story about choosing between Washington and Caracas. It is about what happens to small states when they mistake alignment for strategy.View image in fullscreenMaduro supporters hold up pictures of Kamla Persad-Bissessar during a rally against US and Trinidad and Tobago joint military exercises in Caracas, October 2025.Photograph: Pedro Mattey/AFP/Getty ImagesMuch ink has been spilled portraying Trump as the hero and Maduro as the villain. For small states, this distinction offers little protection. Both leaders operate through pressure, spectacle and intimidation. Both personalise power, elevate loyalty over competence, and govern through permanent crisis. Trump does so within institutions that are still resilient but eroding; Maduro atop institutions he had hollowed out. Both are widely perceived as corrupt. Both haveenriched their families, allies, cronies and themselves. Both have the same instincts but different power. Small states, such as Trinidad and Tobago, do not get the luxury of moral binaries when caught between rival strongmen. They get consequences.Venezuela’s relationship with the Caribbean has been economic and strategic. Several states became structurally exposed to Caracas through energy dependence, most notably throughPetroCaribe, launched in 2005 under Chávez, which offered concessional oil financing framed as development support rather than commercial exchange. These arrangements created not only economic ties but political memory. It is notable that the largest number of Venezuelan refugees in the Caribbean live in Trinidad and Tobago.Forget petty bribes, ‘state capture’ is corruption so deep it is shaping the rules of democracy itself | Kenneth MohammedRead moreAgainst this backdrop, expanding US military activity in Trinidad was sold ascounter-narcotics cooperation. Radar installations, “capacity building”, joint exercises – all whilekillings continued unexplainedoff the Venezuelan coast. Trump confirmed what many suspected: this was never about drugs. It is about oil, gas and minerals – what he frames as wealth “stolen” from US corporations during Venezuela’s nationalisation drive. From ExxonMobil to ConocoPhillips,US corporations were systematically expelledunder Chávez and Maduro.Demanding sovereignty has always been the real crime in the region, from Cuba in the north to Venezuela in the south. Without the selective amnesia that often accompanies western commentary, let’s state plainly: Venezuela is a sovereign state whose sovereignty has been repeatedly violated by the US and the UK. Since 2015, US sanctions have immiserated a society, accelerating the collapse of what was a wealthy country anddisplacing millions of people.The most egregious symbol of this pattern was Britain’s seizure of roughly$1.95bn (£1.4bn) in Venezuelan gold held in London– funds refused to Venezuela even during Covid, when they could have financed medicines and humanitarian relief. This was not an anomaly but precedent.First was the refusal to recognise Maduro after Chávez. Thenthe farce of Juan Guaidó– a western-backed fiction who never won an election and never governed. The script has been recycled with María Corina Machado, burnished with accolades and recast as a “president in waiting”, despite inviting foreign military intervention against her own country. She, too, has now beendiscarded by Trumpas not having “respect within the country”. Persad-Bissessar would do well to note the pattern.View image in fullscreenA photo of Trinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, is held up in Venezuela’s parliament as she is declared persona non grata, October 2025.Photograph: Federico Parra/AFP/Getty ImagesMany Venezuelans may despise Maduro. But it is misreading to assume this translates into affection for Washington. Among Venezuelans there is hostility, the US seen as an architect of imperialism. The illusion that Trinidad and Tobago could host US security infrastructure without becoming entangled in Trump’s vendetta was always just that – an illusion by a naive leader.But this crisis cannot be pinned on one government alone. Former prime minister, Keith Rowley, pursued the opposite folly: courting Caracas, indulging in displays of friendship with Maduro, alienating Washington. Rowley and Persad-Bissessar are opportunists. One flirted with the Caracas dictator; the other leans toward Washington’s authoritarianism. Neither built a doctrine grounded in Caribbean collective security. The result is exposure without leverage.None of this is unprecedented.In 2003 Nelson Mandela said, “If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world it is the United States of America. They don’t care for human beings.“To say, look, this is the power that we have, if you dare oppose what we do, this is what is going to happen to you. Who are they now, to pretend that they are the policemen of the world?”Should conflict escalate, Trinidad will bear the costs – economic collapse, refugee inflows, long-term instabilityThat same year Noam Chomsky describeda US “grand imperial strategy”bent on securing global dominance regardless of international law or human cost.All that is new today is brazenness. Invoking the colonialMonroe doctrineto justify stealing Venezuelan oil is pathetic. Under Trump, dissent is framed as unpatriotic, even treasonous. Allies are coerced. Smaller states are used and discarded. Targets are selected solely for resource endowment: oil, gas, minerals.So where does this leave Trinidad and Tobago?Internally, the country is divided – and soon distracted by carnival. Evasive explanations about “airport works” and US radar installations will fade from public memory. But regionally, Trinidad will remain estranged.If perceived – fairly or not – as complicit in US military action against Venezuela, there will be no oil and gas deals with a Rodríguez-led government. The potential loss exceeds $1.2bn annually. Should conflict escalate, Trinidad will bear the costs – economic collapse, refugee inflows, long-term instability – while Washington moves on to its next theatre in Greenland or Cuba.In the end, the hard truth is this: small states such as ours are not geopolitical actors but geopolitical spaces. When leaders forget that distinction, their people are impoverished and their countries become expendable pawns.Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoOpinionVenezuelaAmericasTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

TheTrump administrationrefuses to allow such fraud to continue,” Rollins wrote.Rollins asked Walz and Frey to provide the USDA with justification for all federal spending from 20 January 2025 to the present within 30 days. She is also requiring that all federal payments to the state moving forward require the same justification.Federal judge blocks White House freeze of childcare subsidies in Democratic statesRead more“We’re communicating with state partners to understand the impacts of such a blanket cut to funding meant for residents most in need,” Brian Feintech, a spokesperson for the city of Minneapolis, said in a written statement in response to Rollins’s letter.“What’s abundantly clear is that Minneapolis is the latest target of the Trump administration – willing to harm Americans in service to its perceived political gain.”The Guardian has contacted Walz’s office for comment.Minnesota’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, publicly responded to Rollins’s post,writing on X: “I will not allow you to take from Minnesotans in need. I’ll see you in court.”The USDA’s announcement coincides with afederal rulingthat theTrump administrationcannot block federal money for childcare subsidies and other programs aimed at supporting low-income families with children from reaching five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota.The Trump administration has targeted Minnesota over the past year over allegations of fraud, specifically going after the state’s Somali population. Federal prosecutors estimate as much as $9bn has been stolen across schemes allegedly linked to thestate’s Somali population.Trumpended legal protectionsfor Somali immigrants in the state in November 2025, claiming that “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from.”Shortly thereafter, Trumpwent offon both Somalis and Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota congressional representative who is fromSomaliaand is a US citizen, in a xenophobic rant during a cabinet meeting.“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you,” the president said. He called Omar “garbage” and said “we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country”.A month later, in December 2025, theFBI announced that it was deploying additional investigative and personnel resourcesto “dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs” in the state, according to its director, Kash Patel. Patel said the agency had already dismantled a$250m fraud schemethat stole federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during the Covid pandemic in a case that led to 78 indictments and 57 convictions.Last week, Walz announced that he would not run for a third term as Minnesota’s governor, as his handling of the fraud has fallen under intense scrutiny from Trump and Republicans. In his announcement, Walz acknowledged that the president and his political allies have taken advantage of the crisis to sow further division in the state.“I won’t mince words here,” Walz said. “Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St Paul and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place.”Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A man in his 50s was found dead in the caravan. His death is not being treated as suspicious and his next of kin have been informed, police said.Warnings of snow and ice were issued in Scotland and northern and easternEnglandon Saturday, while people in Wales, the Midlands and south-western areas of England were warned about icy conditions. In Northern Ireland, there were warnings of heavy rainfall. The warning was set at yellow in each area.Yellow warnings were also issued in Scotland and northern England – particularly along the Pennines – and a more severe amber warning for snow in the area inland of Aberdeen, Perth and Stirling in Scotland. A yellow warning will remain in place in northern and western Scotland into Monday.The storm has already brought winds of almost 100mph after forecasters issued a rare red warning for “dangerous, stormy” winds in the south-west.”Almost 22,200 properties were without power in the south-west at 5.30pm on Saturday, according to the National Grid’s website, along with 1,155 in the West Midlands and about 580 in the East Midlands. All power has been restored in Wales.Downing Street said support was being offered to homes without power. National Rail said services may be disrupted over the weekend across England, Wales and Scotland.Forecasters said the combination of melting snow and rain would increase the flood risk in the coming days. About 15cm (6in) of snow was recorded at Lake Vyrnwy in Powys and 7cm at Preston Montford in Shropshire as well as Nottingham.In Scotland, there was 27cm at Altnaharra in Sutherland, 26cm at Loch Glascarnoch and 22cm at Durris in Kincardineshire.A further 2-5cm of snow is expected accumulate on hills above 100m in some areas, with up to 15cm possible in areas above 300m in parts of central and eastern Scotland, according to the Met Office.The Met Office has advised those within alert areas to prepare for delays to journeys and to take extra time when travelling to help avoid slips and falls on the ice.The Met Office meteorologist Annie Shuttleworth said Saturday would get off to a cold start with the risk of “icy stretches” before dry and sunny conditions for some.“So do take care if you’re travelling this morning,” she said. “Across eastern areas of England, there’ll be a few showers through the day, some of these sleety in nature but for most of us, it will be a dry day and for some there will be some sunshine.“A large swathe of northern areas of England, southern Scotland, eastern Scotland as well will see plenty of dry and bright weather. If you are heading out there, you will want a few layers because it is another chilly one out there.“The winds are relatively light, however, so there’s not too much in the way of wind chill, but yes, you’ll certainly want to be wrapping up if you’re heading out this afternoon to enjoy some of that drier weather.”Explore more on these topicsCornwallDevonEnglandPublic transportRail transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Officials said the charge against Moore, who lives in the county, is expected to be elevated to capital murder, and prosecutors could seek the death penalty if he is determined to be mentally competent.“This is horrific. It’s about as bad as it gets,” said Scott Colom, the district attorney for Mississippi’s 16th circuit court, which includes Clay county.Sheriff Scott said investigators believe Moore first shot his father, brother and uncle Friday evening. Afterward, Moore allegedly took a truck and drove to another location, where authorities say he attempted to sexually assault a seven-year-old girl who was related to him before shooting her as well.Scott said that in his 30 years of service, this case marked “one of the toughest ones we had to work”.Officials said the initial shooting occurred shortly before 7pm at a residence on David Hill Road. The victims there were identified as Glen Moore, 67; Willie Guines, 55; and Quinton Moore, 33.A call to emergency services led officials to a home on Blake Road where Moore allegedly forced his way in and “attempted to commit a sexual battery while armed”, Scott said. Deputies later found the body of the seven-year-old girl there.Investigators believe Moore then traveled to a home on Siloam-Griffith Road after stealing a Ford F-150 belonging to his deceased brother.At that location, deputies discovered the stolen truck concealed behind the residence and found the bodies of Barry Bradley and Samuel Bradley, who also appeared to have been fatally shot. Scott said one of them was the pastor at a local church.Authorities said it is not yet known whether the Bradleys had any prior relationship with Moore.Moore was later taken into custody at the intersection of Pine Grove Road and Joe Myers Road just before midnight. He was driving a vehicle that investigators say had been taken from the Siloam-Griffith Road home.Officials have not yet determined what motivated the killings.“This has really shaken our community,” Scott told the press conference. “Personally, I don’t know what kind of motive you could have to kill a seven-year-old.“Autopsies will be conducted by the Mississippi crime lab, Scott said.Moore is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Monday. Colom, the district attorney, said the death penalty will be considered in the case.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The results will come as a blow to Keir Starmer’s administration, which has taken an increasinglyhardline stanceon immigration in recent months.Net migration to the UK fell by more than two-thirds to a post-pandemic low in the year ending June 2025, but 67% of the people polled thought it had increased. Among Reform voters, four in five thought immigration had grown, and more than three in five (63%) believed it had “increased significantly”.The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood,promised “the most substantial reform to the UK’s asylum system in a generation”in November, and proposed a series ofhardline policiesto make the UK less attractive to migrants and refugees.Undernew plansthose with refugee status could wait 20 years to become British citizens, asylum claimants could have their assets confiscated, family reunions could be curbed, and refugees returned if conditions improved in their home countries.But despite the measures, whichsome Labour MPs fiercely oppose, confidence in the government on immigration has plummeted. Three-quarters (74%) of voters said they had little or no confidence in the government on the issue, up from 70% in May last year. Only 18% of voters had confidence, down three percentage points. The biggest drop in confidence came from those who backed Labour in 2024, where confidence dropped by 17%.“The Labour government is facing a growing credibility gap on migration … That tells us that numbers alone are not enough,” said More in Common’s executive director, Luke Tryl. “Until that credibility gap closes, Labour’s migration migraine will persist.”The highly visible issue of small boats remains critical to public perception of migration, he said. According to the polling, 79% of voters wanted the government’s focus to be on stopping the vessels, with only one in 10 believing that reducing legal net immigration should be its top priority.In the year ending June 2025,43,000 people arrived on small boats, up 38% on the previous year but fewer than the 46,000 peak in 2022. Those arriving on small boats make up only a tiny proportion of the overall number of people coming to the UK –less than 5%in 2025, according to Guardian analysis.The polling revealed a persistent and “broad public cynicism” around migration, but a lag in perception could result in voter opinion changing in the coming months, said Marley Morris, from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). “Labour have been doing a lot to emphasise a tough line on migration because they want to try to challenge that perception, but it’s quite ingrained,” he said.In further disheartening news for the government, when given accurate migration figures fewer than one in five credit the government for the decline, with a similar number attributing the drop to the previous Conservative government.Net migration to the UK peaked at a record 944,000 in the year to March 2023 butfell by more than two-thirds to 204,000 in the year to June 2025, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Visa applications to the UK also fell sharply in 2025. Monthly migration statistics published on Thursday showed skilled worker applications were down by 36% and health and care applications down by 51%.Migration minister Mike Tapp said it was evidence that Labour’s plans to back British workers over overseas workers and “restore order to the broken immigration system we inherited is paying off”.“Net migration is at its lowest level in half a decade, and has already fallen by more than two-thirds under this government after it was allowed to explode to nearly one million in recent years,” he said.Kim Johnson, the Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, said the polling revealed the “cost of mimicking Reform” – a rise in racism and a steep decline in work visas, which risked leaving the health and social care sectors in crisis.“The government must present a positive alternative vision, one that supports the rights and dignity of those who moved to Britain to work and build homes and families,” she said. “Otherwise we will continue to see the impact of the divisive rhetoric, including at the ballot box, where such narratives are fuelling – not muting – the Reform vote.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinion pollsReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

Is he ultimately to blame?Nick VisserSat 10 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 16.47 ESTShareMore than a year after a devastatingwildfiretore through Pacific Palisades, all but obliterating one of the west coast’s most iconic neighborhoods, prosecutors are honing their case against the man they say is responsible.Jonathan Rinderknecht, a 29-year-old occasional Uber driver who used to live in Pacific Palisades, was charged with three felonies by federal prosecutors in October, who claim he was in the neighborhood in the early hours of New Year’s Day. According toa federal complaint, Rinderknecht allegedly used an open flame – likely a lighter – to start a small blaze that grew to about 8 acres (3.2 hectares) before firefighters rushed to the area and extinguished it.The LA wildfire victims still living in toxic homes: ‘We have nowhere else to go’Read moreThat blaze was known as the Lachman fire.But on 7 January, just five days after the Los Angeles fire department (LAFD) saidthey had put the Lachman fire out, the embers were whipped into a frenzy by 100mph (161km/h) winds and fed by tinderbox conditions – quickly growing to become the most destructive blaze in Los Angeles history.It was a wildfire known as a “holdover” or “zombie” fire,a type of blaze that scientists say isbecomingmore commonas the climate warms. Now, experts say the case against Rinderknecht will turn on a central question: should he have foreseen the destructive potential of his actions? Or are the firefighters who failed to fully extinguish the zombie fire the ones at fault?View image in fullscreenJonathan Rinderknecht, a suspect in the Palisades fire.Photograph: US attorney’s office via APAya Gruber, a criminal law expert and the Harold Medill Heimbaugh professor of law at the University of SouthernCalifornia, says the outcome will depend on how responsible a jury would deem Rinderknecht for the ultimate deaths of 12 people and the loss of 7,000 structures in what became the Palisades fire.If a person sets a fire and it burns continuously, that is generally considered “one fire” in the eyes of the law, Gruber said. The case will have to delve into the continuity of the burning, and whether the rekindling into the catastrophic Palisades blaze could have been predicted.“Even if [the initial Lachman fire] was a modest fire, was it foreseeable that this turn of events would happen?” she posed.“I don’t think it’s completely unjustified, from a criminal law theory standpoint … just with the environmental conditions in California, that when you set small fires, they can pretty easily turn into out-of-control big fires.”Who deserves the blame?The story of how the Lachman blaze resurrected just days later, and the shortcomings of the firefighting effort to suppress it, have come into sharper focus in recent months.The Los Angeles wildfires were ‘the perfect storm’. Is the city ready for the next one?Read moreThe Los Angeles Times publisheda series of bombshell allegations, citing concerns from firefighters that the Lachman fire was not fully contained before they were ordered by superiors to leave the burn area. Another investigation by the paper also found theLAFD’s “after action” reporton the Palisades fire and the department’s responsewas watered downover the course of seven drafts. Two weeks after the Times published those details, the new chief of the LAFD, Jaime Moore, admitted they were true.“It is now clear that multiple drafts were edited to soften language and reduce explicit criticism of department leadership in that final report,” he told the city’s board of fire commissioners on Tuesday, noting the report was written and edited before he was appointed to the role.“I can assure you that nothing of this sort will ever again happen while I am fire chief.”While Rinderknecht’s attorney appears to be centering his client’s defence on the department’s response to the Lachman fire, experts say the LAFD’s efforts – or failures – will probably not hurt the federal case against Rinderknecht, who faces between five and 45 years in prison.Federal prosecutors have described Rinderknecht as destructive and “reckless”, saying his actions caused “one of the worst firesLos Angeleshas ever seen”.But Steven Haney, Rinderknecht’s attorney, said in October he believed his client is being “scapegoated” and strongly suggested the duty to extinguish the Palisades fire, and its ultimate destruction, rested on the fire department. Haney noted that Rinderknecht called 911 multiple times after the fire broke out to report it. The complaint also notes Rinderknecht told investigators he offered to help firefighters help fight the fire.View image in fullscreenFirefighters respond to homes destroyed while a helicopter drops water as the Palisades fire grows in Pacific Palisades, California, on 7 January 2025.Photograph: David Swanson/AFP/Getty Images“Blaming it on Jonathan Rinderknecht seems a little bit misguided,” Haney told reporters at the time. “It will be heavily litigated what happened during the Lachman fire, why it wasn’t put out.“If the government says the Palisades was caused by the Lachman fire, then somebody, not my client, had a duty to extinguish that fire.”But prosecutors wrote in the complaint Rinderknecht’s actions, including the 911 calls and questions about wildfires posed to ChatGPT, seemed to indicate that he “wanted to preserve evidence of himself trying to assist in the suppression of the fire and he wanted to create evidence regarding a more innocent explanation for the cause of the fire”.Anatomy of an arson caseFederal investigators will have spent months combing through the wreckage of the Palisades fire and the initial blaze, as well as what or who they believe is responsible.Wayne Miller,a retired special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), said arson investigators quickly move to home in on the exact cause of a suspicious fire. Teams on site can examine burn scars to narrow down where, and often how, a blaze began, with those investigations regularly finding the initial pinpoint of a wildfire to an area of just a few feet.Investigators were aided with their Lachman fire investigation by cameras and sensors that detect wildfires that monitor the area where it first began 24 hours a day.“You look at indicators, you look for directional burning, you know if you have small trees and brush, you look to the side that has char,” said Miller, who has been to about 2,300 fire and explosion scenes over the course of his career. “It leads you back to where the fire began.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators hold signs at the They Let Us Burn! rally on the first anniversary of the Palisades fire on 7 January 2026.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesInvestigators could even pinpoint a cigarette butt on the ground if they “look really hard”, Miller said.Miller said that in his reading of the complaint against Rinderknecht, investigators seemed to have discounted many other potential causes. Refraction of sunlight on broken glass was ruled out as it was night-time; nobody saw fireworks in the area or found any evidence of them; there were no lightning strikes or electrical infrastructure in the area. Smoking was also discounted as a cause, as the weather conditions were inconsistent with a cigarette as a source at the time, the complaint says.Miller said over his career, arson sentences often depended on the prosecutor’s ability to craft the story of how a fire began, and how destructive it became to life and property.Then and now: one year on from the Los Angeles wildfires – in picturesRead more“Unless a person is caught with a match in their hand, arson prosecutions are difficult,” he added. “But from everything I’ve read, they’ve got a darn good case where they can nail it right to one person.”A battle of narrativesOther anecdotal details about Rinderknecht’s behavior and actions in the lead-up to the fire will also play a role in the trial. The federal complaint cites two of his Uber passengers that night, who described the man as “agitated and angry”. Cellphone data also shows Rinderknecht listening to a song by the French rapper Josman called Un Zder, Un Thé in the days and hours leading up to the Lachman fire, the lyrics of which are about “despair and bitterness”.“The music video for the song shows the main character … lighting things on fire,” the complaint reads, noting Rinderknecht listened to the song at 11.54pm on New Year’s Eve, just moments before the Lachman fire began.Digital evidence also revealed that months before the fire, Rinderknechtused ChatGPT to generate imagesfixated on fire and destruction. Those included a scene of a city being burned down, as well as an image of a burning forest with people running away.View image in fullscreenA lot cleared of fire debris in Pacific Palisades on 7 January 2026.Photograph: Daniel Cole/Reuters“On the other side of the gate and the entire wall is a conglomerate of the richest people,” one of the prompts entered into the AI software read. “They are chilling, watching the world burn down, and watching the people struggle. They are laughing, enjoying themselves, and dancing.”Rinderknecht will go to trial on 21 April 2026, and has pleaded not guilty to the felony charges.Gruber said the trial – and any potential punishment – will probably become a battle of legal narratives between prosecutors and Rinderknecht’s defense attorney over different accounts of the “zombie” fire.“The first is: this isn’t so unusual, it’s not on the outer limits of foreseeable. We have Santa Ana winds every year, that’s not unforeseeable,” she said. “You could also argue that this type of zombie fire is very unusual, so that is what it would turn on.”Gruber said while she’s skeptical that major cases and their punishments deter other bad actors, if Rinderknecht is convicted and sentenced to a lengthy prison term, it could send a message to small fire-setters: “If you cause a major fire, you’re going to get a lot of time, so don’t even start the small fires.”Explore more on these topicsUS crimeLos Angeles wildfires: one year laterLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastCalifornia wildfiresfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A billionaire carries, on average, an investment portfolio in companies that will produce 1.9m tonnes of CO2a year – roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of 400,000 petrol cars.To stay within the agreed global heating limit of no more than 1.5C above preindustrial levels set by the Paris agreement in 2015, the richest 1% of the world’s population would have to reduce their emissions by 97% by 2030.Beth John, a climate justice adviser at Oxfam GB, said the UK government should focus on the richest polluters in order to limit damage caused by emissions.“Repeated opportunities to make the richest pay their fair share for climate action have been missed in the UK, but there is still so much that can be done,” she said. “Fairly taxing the biggest polluters, such as private jets and oil and gas companies, is an obvious place to start to generate the funds needed to transition to a fairer, greener future.”Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsThe super-richPollutionAir pollutionClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

It may be a form of child abuse or an offence against the person,” it adds.Last month, acoroner issued warningsabout insufficient regulation over who can perform a circumcision after the death of a six-month-old boy, Mohamed Abdisamad, from a streptococcus infection in 2023.The case echoed another coroner’s concerns over thedeath of Oliver Asante-Yeboah who died in 2014from sepsis after a circumcision was performed on him by a rabbi.According to the Office for National Statistics, since 2001 there have beenseven deaths of boys under 18where circumcision was a factor. At least three of these involved babies who bled to death:Celian Noumbiwein 2007;Goodluck Caubergsin 2010; andAngelo Ofori-Mintahin 2012.Jonathan Arkush, a former president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews and co-chair ofMilah UK, which promotes and protects the right of the Jewish community to carry out religious circumcision, said the wording in the draft CPS guidance was misleading.“To suggest that circumcision is in itself a harmful practice, is deeply pejorative and misplaced,” he said. “Any procedure that is carried out inappropriately or without proper controls, including piercing a child’s ears, could be a harmful practice and a possible case of child abuse.”He added: “We shall certainly be talking to the CPS. I would very much expect that final draft not to include it, as it is so obviously incorrect and/or misleading.”Arkush, who is also a barrister, accepted that if performed incorrectly, circumcision could constitute abuse, but he insisted the “stringent standards” applied by the Jewish community ensured this did not happen.“The incidence of complications in circumcision performed in the Jewish community is vanishingly rare,” he said.“Circumcision is a core part of our identity. I have never met any Jewish man who thinks they’ve been harmed by circumcision.”The Muslim Council of Britain said it supported the coroner’s call for stronger safeguards and a system of accreditation.“Male circumcision is a lawful practice in the UK with recognised medical, religious and cultural foundations, and it should not be characterised in itself as child abuse,” it said.“However, where procedures are carried out irresponsibly, without proper safeguards, and cause harm, they may rightly fall within the scope of criminal law. The lack of consistent regulation elsewhere creates unacceptable risks, and addressing those risks to protect young boys should be an urgent priority.”Prof Faye Ruddock, chair of the Caribbean and AfricanHealthNetwork said the lack of official information on the issue could fuel risks.“We need measures to ensure people are educated on the risks when they have their baby, but currently this information isn’t readily available in perinatal and neonatal spaces, or community spaces like churches,” Ruddock said.“Safeguarding and culturally competent regulation is something that would go a long way. Nobody wants their child to die, but not everyone has the same access to people who are credible.”Last January, a private circumciser and former doctor,Mohammad Siddiqui, was sentenced to more than five years in prisonfor causing “gratuitous pain and suffering” to children in “unsanitary and dangerous” circumcisions.In May, Mohammed Alazawi, who falsely claimed to be a doctor, was convicted of six counts of wounding with intent in circumcision procedures. The judge said the law around male circumcision should be changed because it“remains almost entirely unregulated”.Gordon Muir, a London-based consultant urological and andrological surgeon, argued that the procedure is “unnecessary and will not do any physical good”. “I think it is a form child abuse and the correct thing to do would be to wait until the child is 16 or more and is able to make a rational decision about it,” he said.Muir said he has faced hundreds of letters of criticism when hepublished an academic paperthat found there was no high-quality evidence to support any benefits from circumcision, and that in rare instances it caused avoidable harm and occasional deaths.Rabbi Jonathan Romain, the convener of Reform Beit Din, Progressive Judaism’s religious court, defended circumcision as an “enormously powerful symbolic act of identity”.But he said action was needed to ensure the number of medically qualified practitioners kept pace with demographic change.He said Progressive Judaism, which represents 83 congregations, was developing a training, mentoring and monitoring scheme to ensure a “new generation of circumcisers” was educated in best practice, urging the government to adopt a model that “covers all faiths and traditions” and carried legal penalties for anyone who operated outside it.The National Secular Society welcomed the CPS guidelines. But its human rights lead, Alejandro Sanchez, a former NHS doctor, said: “Relying on the criminal justice system only deals with harm after it has happened.

Many staff felt there was no point in reporting physical or sexual harm because perpetrators faced no real comeback from the NHS or the police.Chloe, 29, a resident doctor in an acute medical unit at a London hospital, said she had frequently dealt with abuse and threats since completing her training just over a year ago. “Patients have told me to fuck off, and that they’ll ‘sue the shit out of me’,” she said. Male patients have also sexually harassed her during intimate treatments, she added. “I’ve had lots of men implying that I enjoy it or that I want to have a look [at their genitals]. One guy who grabbed my arm as I was putting the catheter in kept telling me ‘Oh, you’re so beautiful’. It was very uncomfortable.”Chloe said she often felt unable to remove herself from hostile situations because of staff shortages and concerns about leaving other patients at risk of harm. On one night shift, when she was the only doctor for 40-50 patients, she said a female patient stormed into a staff room and threatened her. “She was screaming ‘why haven’t you fucking come to see me? You should kill yourself’ I had to move a chair between us. Luckily, a nurse came and distracted her and she stormed back to her room. I’ve been lucky not to be physically assaulted but it’s so common. Two colleagues were severely assaulted by patients just outside the emergency department the other day.”Emily, a charge nurse from England, said A&E staff faced daily violence and sexual harm from patients and their relatives. “Nurses have been spat at, pushed, and punched,” she added, saying colleagues had left the NHS or gone on prolonged sick leave after suffering injuries and trauma. She said a particularly worrying development since the pandemic was the increasing number of younger patients, aged 14 to 25, bringing knives and other weapons into her hospital: “This happens once a month. That is utterly terrifying when you’ve got a very overcrowded A&E department. Someone could do catastrophic harm in a matter of minutes.”Like Chloe, Emily said sexual harassment by patients was common. She recounted two separate incidents in her emergency department where men, seemingly waiting for treatment, deliberately ejaculated on nurses. Neither man had mental health or medical issues that might mitigate their behaviour, she added.Although the two men were prosecuted, Emily said there were usually no consequences for abusive patients. Her trust issues warnings and treatment bans but, in practice, there is “nothing to stop them coming back a few hours later or booking into A&E under an alias”. Together with the sheer volume of abuse and rising demand for treatment, this means staff report only a small minority of abusive incidents. “When you’re managing too many patients, you are only going to report the tip of the iceberg,” added Emily.‘None of us feel safe’: attacks on A&E nurses double in six years as waits riseRead moreJohn, a risk manager in a large northern teaching hospital, said dealing with the rise in patient hostility was hampered by staff shortages, budget cuts and police inaction. “People have found that you can act in a threatening way to get what you want and there won’t be any comeback,” he said, adding that at least two staff a week were treated in A&E after attacks by patients.“Fifteen years ago, it wouldn’t have been appropriate to stand in A&E swearing and hitting people,” he said, noting that many perpetrators were mentally well patients aggressively demanding treatment. “If you did, you’d be arrested and you wouldn’t get care. Whereas now the police aren’t coming, you’re not going to be arrested, and you actually get care faster, so staff can get you out of the department. We took down the poster saying there was zero tolerance to violence and aggression. The argument was that we can’t say that because there isn’t. No one’s getting prosecuted.”He and several other staff highlighted the challenges caused by admitting mentally unwell teenagers who were waiting for specialist psychiatric treatment. “We have a child patient and they are assaulting every staff member that comes near them,” said John. “Last week, three of our nurses were in A&E. One had been strangled, one had been hit in the face with a table. The other one had been punched and had their eyes gouged. It’s horrific, the level of violence. But the police won’t touch it because patients are medically unwell, so they won’t have them in the cells. They’ll just bring them back to A&E.”Other staff said a lack of beds for mentally ill adults and people with dementia contributed to the increase in violent incidents.George, 59, a former consultant at a teaching hospital in northern England, said he experienced two potentially life altering assaults in the months before he retired two years ago. Both incidents involved mentally ill adults who were being treated on medical wards because no specialist care beds were free. “The first was a patient who managed to obtain a knife from the staff kitchen,” he said. “He told a male nurse that he was going to kill me, and attempted to attack me but the nurse disarmed him.”Weeks later, another patient, who was on a medical ward despite being known to be psychotic, attacked him from behind and punched him in the head. “He wrestled me to the floor and kicked me,” said the former doctor. “He had already assaulted three or four nurses before that happened. He was a danger to everybody, including the other patients. It was only after this incident that he was sectioned under the MentalHealthAct.”Adam, a paramedic from the south-west of England, agreed that the difficulty of accessing mental health services was a major factor behind a huge increase in violence and aggression toward ambulance crews since the pandemic. Although he and his colleagues were now equipped with bodyworn cameras, this did not deter attacks, he added. “I’ve been grabbed, I’ve been strangled,” he said. “I’ve had knives pulled on me in the back of ambulances.”His ambulance service regularly has to deal with aggressive patients who ring 999 whenever they are in crisis. “Some of these people are phoning 100-200 times within a six-month period,” he said, adding that these patients had warning markers in their medical records but police often refused to deal with them because their mental health problems were deemed to be an ambulance matter. “That’s exposing staff to an increased level of violence and aggression, as having the police there is generally a deterrent,” he said.Adam said that even when the police did respond to reports of assault, they often did not take action because it was not in the public interest to prosecute vulnerable patients. “They’ve basically been let off,” he said. “Even though they’ve assaulted us and damaged equipment on the ambulance.”Share your experienceIf you've been affected by any of the issues raised in this article and would like to share your experience, please do so in the form below.

But recent retail figures have shown a revival.Sales of the good book reached a record high in the UK in 2025, increasing by 134% since 2019 – the highest since records began – according to industry research. Last year, total sales of Bibles in the UK reached £6.3m, £3.61m up on 2019 sales.The sudden uptick of interest has caused booksellers and scholars to ask some profound questions of their own, such as where these newly curious readers are coming from and whether faith, or another more modern phenomenon – namely social media influencers – have called them to the word of God.View image in fullscreenAude Pasquier, of Church House bookshop by Westminster Abbey, says she has seen a rise in people coming to the Bible for the first time.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian“We’ve seen an increase in people coming to the Bible from scratch,” says Aude Pasquier, retail sales director at Church House bookshop near Westminster Abbey.“They have no Christian background whatsoever. They have no grounding from their parents or from their school. Whereas most people in prior generations would have.“It’s definitely younger people who are seeking some sort of spirituality – they want to understand the world and themselves better,” she said.Steve Barnet, the owner of St Andrews bookshop in Buckinghamshire, believes that same search for spirituality is setting some young people on a path which starts with online personalities such as Jordan Peterson – the conservative Canadian influencer – and leads to religious texts such as the Bible.“[Peterson] is not a Christian, but through him, a lot of people are going on a spiritual journey. Some are ending up in church, some are ending up elsewhere. Some are ending up in a good place. I would think ending up as a Christian in church is a good place.”Tommy Robinson says he found Jesus in prison. Churches disagree about how to respondRead moreBarnet has personally observed a new “surprising” clientele of young men entering his shop. “Almost out of the blue something’s changed where people are turning to faith,” he says.The research was conducted by Christian publisher SPCK Group. It analysed data from the Nielsen BookScan, a service that compiles the sales data of books across the globe.The study also suggests that religion is one of the fastest growing nonfiction genres, with an 11% boost in sales in 2025, an increase from 2024, when sales grew by 6%. Last year, the bestselling Bible translation was the English Standard Version published by Crossway.View image in fullscreenFor some young people, the spiritual journey starts with online personalities, such as Jordan Peterson, and leads to religious texts, says Steve Barnet.Photograph: Chris Williamson/Getty ImagesThe upward surge in Bible sales in the UK correlates with growth in church attendance in England and Wales in previous years. According to areportpublished in April 2025 by the Bible Society, the number of people attending church in England and Wales rose by 50% since 2018.Leading the charge is young people. Only 4% of 18- to 24-year-olds said they attended church monthly in 2018, but in 2024 that number rose to 16% – the largest increase of any age demographic.Sam Richardson, the CEO of the publisher SPCK Group, notes that these findings are indicative of a changing tide in which the appeal ofChristianityhas emerged as a “counter-cultural” force, particularly for younger generations in the UK, who have grown up in more secular family and social environments.“The rebellious thing to do was to be an atheist and follow people like Richard Dawkins and the new atheism which used to be very popular. Now, I think things are reversed. For the next generation it’s more interesting to be a Christian, they’re open to exploring that rather than being automatically closed against it,” says Richardson.“As we face worldwide political and social change, including the after effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, global wars, the rise of AI, and a growing mental health crisis, individuals are re-engaging with questions of meaning and spirituality.”Richardson also considers social media an instrumental factor that has made Christianity more “accessible” to young people. “There’s lots of ways that people can have visibility of other people’s spiritual journeys in a much more personal way than was done 20 years ago where you might have to turn up at church and listen to whoever’s in the pulpit.”The Bible Society report also highlighted that men are more likely to go to church than women, suggesting that this widening interest in Christianity has been spurred by younger males specifically.The trend is also echoed in the US, where Bible sales reached a21-year-highin 2025. Similar to the US, a brand of Christian nationalism leveraged for political gain has now become part of the UK political discourse. At aUnite the Kingdom carol servicein December, far right figure Tommy Robinson stood beneath a banner which read: “Jesus saves.”However, leading figures in theChurch of Englandwere quick to denounce the “co-opting or corrupting of the Christian faith and symbols to exclude others.”Richardson says that peaking church attendance and Bible sales predates the development of a Christian nationalist rhetoric. “It has probably been overplayed as a factor,” he says. “There’s definitely something going on, but it seems very recent that Christian nationalism has really started to get attention, whereas this increase in Bible sales has been sustained for six or seven years since 2019.”Explore more on these topicsChristianityYoung peopleReligionSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

With money tight after Christmas, 31% plan to actively review and cancel unused services, it said.Mark Nalder, the service, operations and performance director at Nationwide, said the start of a new year is a “natural time to reassess spending and priorities. Whether it’s pooling resources for a cheaper family plan with your housemates or cancelling memberships you’ve forgotten about, managing your regular outgoings and factoring them into your budget can be crucial in avoiding overspend.”Personal finance experts say to start with an audit of your spending on apps and services. Go through your bank statement and collate payments to TV, delivery, media and product subscriptions on a spreadsheet. Note when you last used them and the total cost. You may discover one that you have forgotten about.Rebecca Bebbington of the discount site NetVoucherCodes said: “Start by making a full list of everything you pay for regularly: monthly, quarterly or annually. Note down which services you actually use and mark down the renewal dates.”Armed with your spreadsheet you will be able to weigh up the services you value most and those that are expendable. If you signed up toApple TVto watch Severance or Ted Lasso, what is the point in continuing to pay £9.99 a month once you have finished the series?You can cancel monthly streaming contracts when you like, and shows or films may be available on different services. At the moment, Wonka is available for rent on Apple at £3.49 or to stream on Prime as part of a subscription.“Try leapfrogging,” Bebbington said. “Instead of juggling multiple streaming subscriptions, stick with one at a time. Plan how you watch, enjoy, cancel, and then hop on to the next.”.You may be entitled to some subscriptions for free alongside other products you pay for. For example, if you have a Club Lloyds bank account (£5 a month fee), you get to pick a free “lifestyle benefit” from a list that includes 12 months of Disney+.If you pay £95 a year for Amazon Prime, you get a Deliveroo Plus Silver package (normally £3.49 a month) with it, which gives free delivery on orders above £15. There are often free trials on subscriptions if you want to switch. For instance, Spotify Premium is free for a month before the £12.99 monthly charge kicks in. However, remember to cancel the service after the free trial if you do not want to add further to your bills.If you want to keep but reduce the cost of a subscription, you may be offered a cheaper rate if you threaten to cancel. Towards the end of a discounted period is a good time to approach the company as it may have an extended trial or a promotional code.You may also be able to save if there are a number of people in your house using the same service. “Spotify’s Premium Family plan, priced at £21.99 per month for up to six members living together is significantly cheaper than individual plans, which are £12.99 each. For couples, a Duo Premium plan is just £17.99,” Bebbington said.New consumer protections due to come into effect later this year will oblige companies to contact people with details of the subscriptions they have and how they can cancel them.Katrina Anderson, a lawyer from Cambridge-based Mills & Reeve, said: “This is to remind people that they have subscriptions that they might or might not want and to consider whether they would actually like to cancel them and how to cancel them.”If you want to chart how long your new year resolutions will take to see results, you can useour calculatorto see how quickly diverting money into a savings account can help you build up a nice nest egg.Explore more on these topicsSaving moneyConsumer affairsNationwideNetflixAmazon Prime VideoApple TVTV streamingnewsShareReuse this content"

We must decide our country’s future ourselves – without pressure to make a hasty decision, without procrastination, and without interference from other countries.”The statement was signed by Nielsen, his predecessor as prime minister, Múte B Egede, and Pele Broberg, Aleqa Hammond and Aqqalu C Jerimiassen.At a meeting with oil and gas executives at the White House earlier on Friday, Trump had said Greenland was crucial for US national security. “We’re not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland. That’s what they’re going to do if we don’t. So we’re going to be doing something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult way,” he told reporters.2:03Trump says US will do 'something on Greenland, whether they like it or not' – videoTrump is “actively” discussing making a potential offer to buy the island with his national security team, the White House confirmed earlier this week.Greenlanders have repeatedly expressed their refusal to be part of the US, with 85% of the populationrejectingthe idea, according to a 2025 poll.Polling also shows only7% of Americanssupport the idea of a US military invasion of the territory, which the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen,recently saidwould mean the end of “Nato and therefore post second world war security”.She hasurged Trumpto stop threatening to take over the country, saying the US has “no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish kingdom [meaning Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands]”.Trump said on Friday: “If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t have aNatoright now.” When asked whether his priority was preserving the alliance or acquiring Greenland, he previously told the New York Times: “It may be a choice.”Asked about Trump’s statement, the head of Nato’s forces in Europe, US Gen Alexus Grynkewich, said he did not wish to comment on whether the alliance – which includes Denmark – would survive without the US.But he responded on Friday by saying Nato was far from being in a crisis.“There’s been no impact on my work at the military level up to this point … I would just say that we’re ready to defend every inch of alliance territory still today,” he said.“So I see us as far from being in a crisis right now,.”The US has operated a military base on the northwestern tip of Greenland since the second world war, where more than 100 military personnel are permanently stationed. Existing agreements with Denmark would allow Trump to bring as many troops as he wanted to the island.But Trump told reporters on Friday that a lease agreement was not enough. “Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don’t defend leases,” he said. “And we’ll have to defend Greenland,.”Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, but was told it was not for sale. Since then he has claimed that Greenland, which has vast natural resources including rare-earth minerals and potentially huge oil and gas reserves, “is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place”.In aninterview with the Guardianon Friday, Jess Berthelsen, the chair of SIK, Greenland’s national trade union confederation, said people in the territory did not recognise the US president’s allegations that Russian and Chinese ships were scattered throughout its waters. “We can’t see it, we can’t recognise it and we can’t understand it,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDonald TrumpNatonewsShareReuse this content"

In court filings and a hearing earlier on Friday, the states contended that the government did not have a legal reason for withholding the money from them.The US Department of Health and Human Services said it was pausing the funding because it had “reason to believe” the states were granting benefits to people in the country illegally, though it did not provide evidence or explain why it was targeting those states and not others.Trump officials sue California cities over laws to restrict fossil fuelsRead moreUS district judge Arun Subramanian, who was nominated to the bench by Joe Biden, did not rule on the legality of the funding freeze but said the five states met a legal threshold “to protect the status quo” for at least 14 days while arguments are made in court.Health department officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The affected programs are the Child Care and Development Fund, which subsidizes childcare for 1.3 million children from low-income families; the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides cash assistance and job training; and the Social Services Block Grant, a smaller fund that provides money for a variety of programs.The five states say they receive a total of more than $10bn a year from the programs.New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, who is leading the lawsuit, called the ruling a “critical victory for families whose lives have been upended by this administration’s cruelty”.The government had requested reams of data from the five states, including the names and social security numbers of everyone who received benefits from some of the programs since 2022.The states argue that the effort is unconstitutional and is intended to go after Trump’s political adversaries rather than to stamp out fraud in government programs – something the states say they already do.Jessica Ranucci, a lawyer in James’s office, said during the Friday hearing that at least four of the states had already had money delayed after requesting it. She said that if the states cannot get childcare funds, there will be immediate uncertainty for providers and families who rely on the programs.A lawyer for the federal government, Kamika Shaw, said it was her understanding that the money had not stopped flowing to states.The other 45 states face a new requirement to check attendance at childcare centers and submit “strong justification for the use of funds” that aligns with the program’s purpose.At about the same time the judge stopped the freeze on the childcare subsidies, the US agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, announced that the administration would freeze about $130m a year in funding from her agency toMinnesota.Rollins said the state’s inability to stop fraud schemes led to the decision. Seventy-eight people have been charged since 2022 – and 57 convicted – after federal prosecutors said the Minnesota non-profit group Feeding Our Future stole $250m from a program meant to feed children in need during the Covid-19 pandemic.The office of Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, did not immediately have a comment on Friday evening. The state’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, said he’d fight the new freeze of funds in court.In a letter to Walz that Rollins shared on social media, she suggested the state could restore its access to the funding by providing justification for how it spent federal dollars over the past year. All the state’s future transactions involving money from the agency will require the same justification, she said.Walz and Minnesota have become a main target of the administration in Trump’s second term.Last month, the president called the state’s Somali population “garbage” in the wake of the Feeding Our Future investigation and other fraud cases involving Somali defendants.And this week the administration launched the largest immigration enforcement operation in history in Minneapolis, leading to a fatal shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationChildcareLaw (US)MinnesotaNew YorkCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

YTL said the payments were not bonuses.YTL initially declined to identify the company that made the payments. Only after repeated questions about the transparency of its executive pay arrangements did YTL reveal the source.The existence of the extra payments to Jefferson and Pymer, alongside former chief executive Colin Skellett, was revealed in the accounts of Wessex Water Services. The accounts said: “Colin Skellett, Andy Pymer and Ruth Jefferson received emoluments for services to other group companies which are disclosed in the financial statements for those companies.”However, the size of the fees was not disclosed in the accounts of any of the group’s companies. They came on top of pay from the regulated company worth £440,000 for Jefferson and £249,000 for Pymer.Water company executive pay has come under particular scrutiny after the government banned bonuses for bosses at suppliers guilty of criminal pollution.Six water companies werebanned from paying bonuses last year. The government included Wessex because of a criminal conviction for a sewage pumping station failure six years earlier, which killed more than 2,000 fish and resulted in the company paying a fine of £500,000. The ban applied to its chief executive and chief financial officer.The spokesperson said Jefferson and Pymer received the payments from Wessex Water Ltd between July 2024 and 1 October 2024. Jefferson’s pay was not subject to the bonus ban before the latter date, when she took over as chief executive. Neither executive “received any bonus from any source” during the year, the spokesperson said.“Wessex Water has always been transparent about its finances and publishes its accounts in line with regulatory accounting guidelines,” the spokesperson said.Sarah Dyke, the Liberal Democrat rural affairs spokesperson and MP for Glastonbury and Somerton, said: “This lack of transparency over bosses’ pay only adds to the need to bring water companies into line.“Wessex Water has gotten away with environmental vandalism and taking customers for fools for far too long. From carelessly polluting beaches and rivers throughout the south-west with filthy sewage to losing millions of litres of water through leaky pipes.”The Wessex spokesperson said the company “does not ‘carelessly pollute’ beaches and rivers”, but said its storm overflows were “part of an outdated sewerage system” that it was investing to upgrade.MPs and Ofwat, the regulator of water companies in England and Wales, have already raised questions over the lack of transparency over payments to water bosses from other group companies.The Guardian last monthrevealed that YTL had paid Skellett a £170,000 bonusin the same year to June 2025. YTL said the bonus was not related to Skellett’s work for Wessex Water during the year to June, but rather was related to YTL’s property interests.Yorkshire Water’s owners also gave its chief executive, Nicola Shaw,£1.3m in undisclosed extra pay via an offshore company. Shaw was also allowed to keep the pay, after Ofwat determined it was not a performance-related bonus, although she admitted not disclosing payments from a separate company was a “mistake”, after politicians responded with outrage.Jefferson was promoted to lead Wessex Water after serving as chief compliance officer and general counsel. She was paid £440,000 in the 2024-25 financial year by Wessex Water Services. She will receive £590,000 in base salary this year, before any bonuses. Pymer received £249,000 from Wessex Water Services last year..YTL’s explanation of the source of the extra payments to Jefferson and Pymer changed over the course of several weeks.The YTL spokesperson initially said: “The payments did not come from any specific company, just YTL UK as the parent company for the various businesses in the country.”There is no company named “YTL UK” on the UK companies register. After repeated questions, the company acknowledged that the payments were in fact made by Wessex Water Ltd, which sits directly above Wessex Water Services in the group’s complex corporate structure.Wessex Water Ltd’s accounts made no reference to payments to Jefferson and Pymer. However, the spokesperson said Wessex Water Services had not made an incorrect statement because the payments were reported “within the aggregate payroll costs of the group” – a tally that includes the salaries of 3,200 people.There was no “statutory or regulatory requirement to separate the costs out” because they were not directors of the parent company, the spokesperson added.Skellett has previously said that water executives should only receive large pay packets if they perform well. Speaking at a union meeting in 2024 he said the “buck stops” with the chief executive.“We get a lot of money,” he said, according to Utility Week. “If we don’t deliver what we should deliver we shouldn’t get that money.”Explore more on these topicsWater industryUtilitiesExecutive pay and bonusesCorporate governanceRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

What can we learn from their prophecies?Joanna KavennaSat 10 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTShareThis year marks 100 years since the first demonstration of television in London. Elizabeth II sent the first royal email in 1976. The first meeting of the Lancashire Association of Change Ringers took place in 1876. All notable anniversaries. But I’m going with 2026 as the 85th anniversary of a great short story:Jorge Luis Borges’s The Garden of Forking Paths (1941). It’s about chance, labyrinths and an impossible novel. Ts’ui Pên, an ancestor of the narrator, sets himself the task of writing a novel with a cast of thousands:“an enormous guessing game, or parable, in which the subject is time”. In most novels, when a character reaches a fork in the path, they must choose: this way, or that way. Yet in Ts’ui Pên’s novel, all possible paths are chosen. This creates “a growing, dizzying web of divergent, convergent, and parallel times”. The garden of forking paths is infinite.It’s often said that Borges’s story foreshadows the multiverse hypothesis in quantum physics – first proposed by Hugh Everett in 1957, then popularised by Bryce DeWitt in the 1970s as the “many worlds interpretation” of quantum mechanics. In a 2005 essay, The Garden of the Forking Worlds, the physicist Alberto Rojo investigated this claim. Did the physicists read Borges? Or did Borges read the universe? It turned out that Bryce DeWitt hadn’t known about Borges’s garden. When Rojo questioned Borges, he also denied everything: “This is really curious,” he said, “because the only thing I know about physics comes from my father, who once showed me how a barometer works.” He added: “Physicists are so imaginative!”As Rojo’s mock-inquiry demonstrates, fictional foreshadowing is a strange art. We don’t live in Borges’s garden, so it’s impossible to go back in time, splice the universe and ascertain what happens if Borges never writes about splicing the universe. Would Everett still propose his universe-splicing theory? The universe is mysterious; so is the interplay of cause and effect. HG Wells’s 1914 futuristic novel The World Set Free portrays the devastating effects of compact “atomic bombs”. The physicist Leo Szilard read Wells’s novel in 1932 and conceived the nuclear chain reaction in 1933. We can’t enter a parallel world wherein Wells thrives as a draper’s apprentice, stops writing and becomes the distinguished manager of Hyde’s Drapery Emporium in Southsea. Yet, one line of influence is clear. When Szilard realised the significance of his theory, he felt afraid: “Knowing what it would mean – and I knew because I had readHG Wells.”The future is an uncharted territory, a place beyond maps. This affords writers a certain imaginative freedom: to create dystopias, utopias, experiments and imaginary societies. In Begum Rokeya’s Sultana’s Dream (1905) – which appeared a decade before Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland–a traveller ventures into a matriarchal hi-tech society where hard labour is done “by electricity”, it’s easy to cook and transport options include a sort of hydrogen helicopter. Marge Piercy’s 1976 novel Woman on the Edge of Time considers both utopian and dystopian futures: a peaceful rural commune versus a torrid hyper-capitalist city where the rich extend their lifespans as the poor struggle to survive. The suggestion of Piercy’s novel is that these futures slide in and out of existence, responsive to events in the present. Or perhaps they only exist in the mind of the protagonist. Octavia E Butler’s 1993 Parable of the Sower and 1998 Parable of the Talents are set in a post-apocalyptic California. Once again the wealthy immure themselves against dystopia, sequestered in fortified communities. The climate is wrecked; people long for the good old days. A nefarious president swears he will “Make America Great Again” – looking backwards to Reagan, forwards to Maga. Butler describes her characters in a state of surreal detachment; their climate apocalypse feels “old hat in science fiction”. This sense of reality as implausible, eerily akin to meta-fiction, foreshadows our own ironic-dystopian present.View image in fullscreenFictional foreshadowing … Tom Cruise in Minority Report (2002)Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyThen there are the writers who predicted our surveillance society: Yevgeny Zamyatin in We (English translation published in 1924), Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1932) and George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). These novels are so absurdly relevant to our age of surveillance capitalism that it seems our tech barons have used them not as satirical warnings but as motivational texts. In all three futuristic societies, an ideological super-state prohibits any form of privacy. Solitude is mistrusted because it encourages contemplation and possible independence of thought. Even the privacy of the inner mind is – wherever possible – violated. A successor to these novels is Margaret Atwood’s 1985 The Handmaid’s Tale, another prescient story of mass surveillance and the control of women’s bodies by reactionary governments. Meanwhile, Atwood’s MaddAdamtrilogy (Oryx and Crake, 2003; The Year of the Flood, 2009; MaddAdam, 2013) foregrounds ethical dilemmas concerning bioengineering, pandemics and monopolistic corporations.In Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel Snow Crash,the “metaverse” is an immersive virtual reality, requiring a headset. In 2021, Mark Zuckerberg famously rebranded the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp as Meta and stated his intention to develop a “metaverse”. William Gibson’s 1984 novel Neuromancer imagined a VR-scape called the Matrix.This novel brought the term “cyberspace” into, well, cyberspace (and beyond). In Philip K Dick’s The Minority Report (1956), pre-crime units employ psychics to predict future crimes so the police can make preemptive arrests. What happens, Dick asks, if a crime is predicted but the future malefactor changes their mind? Are they still pre-guilty? Fast-forward to our present and, yes, pre-crime operations are being trialled across the UK. No psychics required; oracular law enforcement agencies use data mining, predictive algorithms and facial recognition instead. What could possibly go wrong?Finally, there is Dick’s endlessly helpful idea of “kipple”, coined in his 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. For Dick, “Kipple is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers.” The first law of kipple is that “it drives out nonkipple”. You can’t win against kipple, “except temporarily and maybe in one spot”. Kipple is now all the algo-rubbish online, our bulging inboxes, the AI slop. Could Dick have predicted this? Can some prescient novelists really see the future?Future fictions are, as Atwood has said, really deep examinations of the present. From there, as Borges shows, it’s an enormous guessing game. Some guesses at the future are better than others. Some are strangely brilliant. Could Dick have envisioned, all the way back in the 1960s, a world where humans would be swamped by the flotsam and jetsam of modern life – or was he really writing about overwhelm in his own present moment? Either way, his advice still applies, both prescient and inspiring: maybe all we can do is find a balance between the pressures of kipple and nonkipple – the useless junk and the objects of value. When the tech barons have taken the dystopias for utopias, perhaps this is as utopian as it gets.

Paul Thomas Anderson’s idiosyncratic activism caperOne Battle After Anotherhas so far dominated, becoming only the fourth film ever to win best film at both the New York and Los Angeles film circles then the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. But how far can it go?One awards battle after another: A-listers face off at this year’s Golden GlobesRead moreIt leads this weekend’sGolden Globeswith nine nominations but the comedy categories also feature Marty Supreme, now riding high at the box office, and its inescapable leading man Timothée Chalamet. Then on the drama side we have Sinners and Hamnet, two very different films solidifying two very different awards narratives. Here’s how I think it might all play out on Sunday:Best film (drama)View image in fullscreenMichael B Jordan and Miles Caton in Sinners.Photograph: Warner Bros Entertainment Inc/PAThe belated attempts to add some diversity to the Globes voting pool have been slowly paying off with this year’s major drama category boasting three films in a foreign language, two from Latino directors, one from a Black director, one from a Middle Eastern director and one directed by an Asian woman. Unlike the category-filling days of films like The Great Debaters or Bobby, each film here is enough of a contender to also make the Oscars big 10, making it slightly harder to predict. Frankenstein is perhaps the least likely, a film respected for its craft but perhaps not as loved for its emotional connection, while Sentimental Value is perhaps the opposite yet could be too modest to win. There’s growing buzz for It Was Just an Accident and The Secret Agent, both timely tales of pushing back against oppressive forces, but I think this is going to be a race between Hamnet andSinners. Sinners has the popular vote (and is the far better film in my opinion) but Hamnet is the more traditional Globes winner and any recent backlash, from those who see it as shameless Oscarbait, has perhaps not had as much impact offline. It’s going to be tight and while I do fear a season of Sinners unfairly being the bridesmaid I think the extra heat from this week’s Actor award noms (with surprise nods for Miles Caton and Wunmi Mosaku) shows there’s still a great deal of momentum that will push it to a win this Sunday.Will win:SinnersShould win:SinnersShoulda been nominated:LurkerBest female actor (drama)View image in fullscreenJessie Buckley, center, in Hamnet.Photograph: Agata Grzybowska/APWhile it might have felt that the buzz had cooled on Hamnet’s Jessie Buckley for a minute, with Rose Byrne winning the majority of early awards, it was more the case of the film being more suited to the bigger voting bodies. Like, say, Oppenheimer, this was never going to be as beloved by the critics circles but after her win at last weekend’s Critics Choice awards, expect first-time nominee Buckley to easily take this one. There’s little competition from surprise entrants like Sorry, Baby’s Eva Victor and Hedda’s Tessa Thompson and while a perfectly chilly Julia Roberts makes the most of the sorry old mess that is After the Hunt, the three-time winner is not even in the race. The Globes also love Die My Love’s Jennifer Lawrence but the film hasn’t been as easy to get behind while Sentimental Value’s Renate Reinsve is arguably Buckley’s closest competition but the distance between them is considerable. Given that even naysayers ofHamnethave praised the tearjerking finale, and that so much of that rests on Buckley’s face, I can’t see her losing this one.Will win:Jessie Buckley (Hamnet)Should win:Julia Roberts (After the Hunt)Shoulda been nominated:Rebecca Hall (Peter Hujar’s Day)Best male actor (drama)View image in fullscreenWagner Moura in The Secret Agent.Photograph: APNot an easy category to predict this time around (unlike last year when Adrien Brody was the obvious choice) and there are maybe two potential outcomes right now. Unlikely to factor into the race is Netflix, first they have Train Dreams’ Joel Edgerton and I think the film and his performance are a little too quiet to make enough noise while Frankenstein’s Oscar Isaac is the most category-filling inclusion of the lot given how any awards heat that film is gaining is related more to craft and the performance of Jacob Elordi. Then there are the two biopic nods and I think the season has cooled on both The Smashing Machine’s Dwayne Johnson and Deliver Me From Nowhere’s Jeremy Allen White. Which leads us to the two less traditionally Globes yet undeniably more persuasive choices. Michael B Jordan, who gives two commanding performances in Sinners (one could argue three after one of the twins is turned into a vampire), could become only the sixth Black actor to triumph in this category, the star appearing in almost every scene of the film. Or I could see Wagner Moura riding the critical wave to a win for The Secret Agent, after awards at Cannes and the New York film critics circle. It all depends on whether voters are going for a big-budget studio blockbuster (albeit made with unusual personality) or an offbeat foreign language indie. I think in this category, Moura might have it but it’ll be close.Will win:Wagner Moura (The Secret Agent)Should win:Michael B Jordan (Sinners)Shoulda been nominated: David Strathairn (A Little Prayer)Best film (comedy or musical)View image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio in One Battle After Another.Photograph: APThis used to be something of a joke category, allowing full-blown duds like Burlesque and The Tourist to call themselves “Golden Globe-nominated” but in recent years it’s often been as competitive as drama. This year feels more clearcut than usual with One Battle After Another almost certain to triumph, given how it’s the most nominated film of the night and has picked up pretty much every precursor so far this season. The closest competition would probably be Marty Supreme, which benefits from a later release and some box office success (it’s likely to outgross One Battle in the US), but it’s more pegged to a particular performance and feels like less of a well-rounded choice. Elsewhere, Blue Moon is similarly more of a performance pick, Bugonia will probably be too offbeat while Nouvelle Vague and No Other Choice both show impressive international progress for comedies at the Globes (there have only been three other foreign language films in this category since 2010) but neither has strong enough momentum. One Battle After Another has this one in the bag.Will win:One Battle After AnotherShould win:One Battle After AnotherShoulda been nominated:TwinlessBest female actor (comedy or musical)View image in fullscreenRose Byrne in If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockAnother strong year for this category (2025 saw Demi Moore beat eventual Oscar winner Mikey Madison and fellow nominees Cynthia Erivo and Karla Sofía Gascón) which features only one actor who hasn’t been nominated for a Golden Globe before. That would be One Battle After Another’s Chase Infiniti whose impressive performance still might not be themostmemorable in a film of many (the film’s best awards chances are arguably in the supporting categories). She’s likely to join Bugonia’s Emma Stone, Song Sung Blue’s Kate Hudson, The Testament of Ann Lee’s Amanda Seyfried and Wicked: For Good’s Cynthia Erivo on the sidelines with what seems like a clear winner leading the pack. A film like If I Had Legs, I’d Kick You might have seemed too weird to be an awards contender a decade ago (it’s still too weird to break into the comedy/musical category by itself) but the landscape has changed considerably since then and Rose Byrne’s career-topping work has already nabbed her almost all of the early awards. It also doesn’t hurt that, like Moore last year, she is still a glamorous Globes-friendly star and if she wins here, she’ll be Buckley’s biggest competition for the Oscar.Will win:Rose Byrne (If I Had Legs, I’d Kick You)Should win:Rose Byrne (If I Had Legs, I’d Kick You)Shoulda been nominated:Kirsten Dunst (Roofman)Best male actor (comedy or musical)View image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyAs with the comedy/musical film category, this is likely to be down to two contenders. Ethan Hawke’s Blue Moon nod is well earned (he’s the best in the category for me) while Bugonia’s Jesse Plemons and No Other Choice’s Lee Byung-hun are far more than category-fillers (as a reminder Saturday Night’s Gabriel LaBelle was nominated last year) and, well, the less said about Jay Kelly’s George Clooney and the total nothingness of that film, the better. So it’s down to old hand Leonardo DiCaprio and young gun Timothée Chalamet to battle it out. As incredibly funny as DiCaprio is in One Battle After Another (for me, he gives the better comedic turn of the two), it’s undoubtedly going to be the first win for Chalamet (he’s racked up an impressive five nods since 2018). The Globes is kinder to younger male talent than the Oscars (recent non-Oscar winners have included Austin Butler, Chadwick Boseman, Sebastian Stan, Andrew Garfield and Taron Egerton) and while his role as Bob Dylan was politely received, the praise heaped on his turn as Marty Mauser is on a different level. Plus it gives the celeb-hungry Globes telecast an excuse to feature even more shots of Kylie Jenner …Will win:Timothée Chalamet (Marty Supreme)Should win:Ethan Hawke (Blue Moon)Shoulda been nominated:Dylan O’Brien (Twinless)Best female supporting actorView image in fullscreenAmy Madigan in Weapons.Photograph: Warner BrosAn unusual category here with an actor nominated for a role she’s already been nominated for (Ariana Grande for Wicked: For Good), two actors from the same film who are speaking in different languages (Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas for Sentimental Value), a character actor playing a witch in a horror (Amy Madigan in Weapons), a singer and one-time reality star as a political revolutionary (Teyana Taylor in One Battle After Another) and, well, Emily Blunt for The Smashing Machine, only unusual perhaps for how unworthy that performance is. I think it’ll be down to Madigan and Taylor, both giving big, all-guns-blazing turns in big studio movies. Madigan won at both the New York film critics circle and the Critics Choice awards so it’s clear she has major support but I think Taylor, giving arguably the most indelible performance in the night’s most nominated film could also take it. It’s a tough call but I think Madigan’s terrifyingly transformative Aunt Gladys has it.Will win:Amy Madigan (Weapons)Should win:Amy Madigan (Weapons)Shoulda been nominated:Wunmi Mosaku (Sinners)Best male supporting actorView image in fullscreenJacob Elordi in Frankenstein.Photograph: APAt a distance, this could seem like a battle between two extremely different performances from two Oscar winners in One Battle After Another, the good of Benicio del Toro and the very bad of Sean Penn. Del Toro has been the more awarded of the two so far with multiple critics circle wins (although my personal pick would be Penn) but I could see the Globes ignoring them both, a problem some films often have with two performers in the same category essentially cancelling the other one out. I don’t think there’s much of a threat from Hamnet’s Paul Mescal, who fades into the background in the movie for Buckley, and I can’t see Adam Sandler winning for Jay Kelly, a film that hasn’t secured enough love since its mixed Venice premiere. There’s reason to believe that Stellan Skarsgård could win for what many see as his career-best work in Sentimental Value especially as the film is also directly about the industry. But I think it’s Frankenstein’s Jacob Elordi who will run away with this one. He won at last week’s Critics Choice awards and it’s the kind of big, unrecognisably different turn that voters have always loved (he’s also the best performer in a film that’s otherwise a little shaky acting-wise). Plus he’s a young, handsome actor and in a category that once awarded the otherwise totally out of the race Aaron Taylor-Johnson for Nocturnal Animals, it would feel like a very old school Globes win.Will win:Jacob Elordi (Frankenstein)Should win:Sean Penn (One Battle After Another)Shoulda been nominated:Miles Caton (Sinners)Best directorView image in fullscreenRegina Hall in One Battle After Another.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyA category here that’s made up of film-makers from five drama nominees and one comedy (sorry to The Secret Agent’s Kleber Mendonça Filho as the one drama snub) and one that’s also likely to be a rare comedy win (the last non-drama winner was Damien Chazelle for La La Land in 2017 and that was very much a musical). Chlé Zhao took this award home for Nomadland back in 2021 but Hamnet feels more performance-led while the same could also be said for Joachim Trier’s Sentimental Value. I think Guillermo del Toro is the category-filler here for Frankenstein, a film that for me is one of his worst. There’s a world where the very deserving Jafar Panahi could also make for a bold statement win for It Was Just an Accident, a film that’s both a propulsive thriller and a brave act of defiance. But I think it will come down to Ryan Coogler for Sinner and Paul Thomas Anderson for One Battle After Another, both bold auteurist epics. I think Anderson will ultimately win out, the film is the most nominated of the night and a juggernaut already this season, and it would make for his first Golden Globe.Will win:Paul Thomas Anderson (One Battle After Another)Should win:Paul Thomas Anderson (One Battle After Another)Shoulda been nominated:Michael Angelo Covino (Splitsville)Explore more on these topicsGolden Globes 2026Golden GlobesOne Battle After AnotherHamnetSinnersAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Based on Rachel Reid’s smash-hit novel, the steamy story follows the relationship between Major League Hockey rivals Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie). Each is dealing with personal demons when they meet ahead of their first match – a moment that triggers an undeniable magnetic pull between the pair. They start a secret fling in between games and press conferences, but it soon grows into a journey of yearning, love, ambition, denial and self-discovery. Even if you’re not a hockey fan, this is one hell of a spectator sport.Hollie RichardsonCasualty8.45pm, BBC OneView image in fullscreenHot shot … new doctor Kim (Jasmine Bayes) in Casualty.Photograph: BBC STUDIOSAfter a short hiatus, Casualty is back with a chaotic revamp to mark its 40th anniversary. It’s the hottest day of the year and, much to the A&E team’s exasperation, two new doctors are joining the department. Quirky Kim (Jasmine Bayes) is welcomed with a patient’s bowl of vomit, while charming Matty (Aron Julius) gets a little too involved in a case. Will they turn things round by the end of an action-packed shift?HRThe Masked Singer7pm, ITV1The first two celebrities have revealed themselves: Disc Jockey was Alex Jones and Teabag was Professor Green. This week’s round is a sports day-themed special, with cricketing hero Freddie Flintoff joining as a guest judge.

The dig finds evidence that throws new light both on Ramses’s assassination and the activities of fabled 20th-century Egyptologist Howard Carter.Jack SealeWaiting for the Out9.35pm, BBC OneDennis Kelly’s hard-edged but cathartic prison drama continues, with puppyish philosopher Dan (Josh Finan) encouraging his class of inmates to think about luck.

What started as a sexy Texas housewives satire is now a full-blown whodunnit. Sophie (Brittany Snow) may own the gun that shot the fatal bullet, but there’s a whole line of suspects – including her new friends and their ringleader Margo (Malin Akerman), who was getting intimate with Sophie on the night of the murder.HRFilm choiceThe Gunfighter, 2.50pm, Great! ActionJimmy Ringo is the fastest gun in the American south-west of the 1880s. But with notoriety comes peril because – as Gregory Peck’s ageing sharpshooter has found – there’s a “squirt” in every town angling to challenge him. Henry King’s tense 1950 western is about how the weight of a legend can drag a man down – but weary Ringo hopes to avoid that when he rides into Cayenne seeking to revive his relationship with teacher Peggy (Helen Westcott) and their young son. However, like all good Greek tragedies, the more he tries to flee his fate the closer it gets.Simon WardellCool Hand Luke, 5.50pm, Sky Cinema GreatsView image in fullscreen‘Gloriously sweat-soaked’ … Cool Hand Luke on Sky Cinema Greats.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyThere are definite Christ-like overtones to the titular chain-gang convict in Stuart Rosenberg’s gloriously sweat-soaked, dirt-engrained drama. An individual in a system that will not tolerate difference, Lucas Jackson (Paul Newman) is the charismatic newcomer who wins over his fellow inmates with an aptitude for taking a beating, trying to escape and eating boiled eggs (a scene that is worth watching the film for alone). Newman oozes star quality as we witness a prison myth in the act of being created.SWA Few Good Men, 10.35pm, Channel 4If you fancy paying tribute to the late Rob Reiner, you could do worse than his 1992 legal thriller. Aside from the sharp tacks and jibes of Aaron Sorkin’s script, there is the pleasure of watching Hollywood’s new and old guard in close combat. Tom Cruise plays a cocky young navy lawyer who teams up with Demi Moore’s fellow litigator to defend two Guantánamo Bay marines accused of murder. Unspoken military codes and delusions of honour impede their case, with Jack Nicholson’s imperious base commander the big beast they must defeat.SWLive sportWomen’s Super League Football: Arsenal v Man United, 11.30am, Sky Sports Main EventMan City v Everton is on Sun at 11am.Men’s FA Cup Football: Macclesfield v Crystal Palace, noon, BBC One/TNT Sports 1The third-round tie at Leasing.com Stadium.

But it’s far more than just a porny sport-based bodice-ripperRhik SamadderSat 10 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTShareIwas surprised to learn that ice hockey romance is a genre, a popular one. Surprising, but it makes sense. Love in a cold setting has a fairytale quality. It’s why the great Russian romances endure, though they aren’t relatable. Most of us don’t sit by windows, waiting for a horse to bring word that our cousin has survived the winter in Smolensk. Perhaps it’s time for a modern Doctor Zhivago? EnterHeated Rivalry(Saturday 10 January, 9pm, Sky Atlantic), a Canadian queer romp so hot it threatens to scorch the ice it skates upon.Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov are star players from Montreal and Moscow respectively, mysteriously drawn to each other on the rink, in the full glare of the media. Well, not that mysteriously. The co-leads get down to business almost immediately, with a not-quite meet cute in a shower room. Every episode thereafter features charged glances, sweaty necks and muscular pumping. Even the camera feels as if it’s in lust, gliding over 8%-fat sports star bodies and the glass walls of luxury flats. It’s an audacious feat, making ice hockey sexy. Those padded uniforms usually make wearers resemble the Thing from The Fantastic Four.It helps that the actors are ravishing. Regardless of which team you play for, Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie draw the eye. The latter (who does a good job with the accent) looks like Michelangelo’s David, with a derriere like a brace of pneumatic hams. Together, they’re uncannily reminiscent of Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in Point Break. No wonder the show, created for Canadian streamer, ah, Crave, has become a runaway success in the US, with clips popping up all over a perma-thirsty social media.Heated Rivalry is not just a porny hockey bodice-ripper; it’s an interesting premise. Sport is a repressively macho arena, and Rozanov’s home country, Russia, hardly heaven for queer people. He’s a libertarian, who loves the club and hotties, but has family struggles he can’t share. Squeaky clean Asian-Canadian Hollander, meanwhile, is a study in self-sacrifice. Eating “bird food” and protecting sponsorship deals, he’s cripplingly aware of how a rumour mill can grind down a personal brand. We’re reminded of the cost of fame, and why young stars might sacrifice love for ambition.Like the arrogant Rozanov, the show knows why you came. It’s serving fan-fic, incognito browser, stag party-experimentation raunch. It’s not explicit, though, and while the sex scenes are bold, they aren’t gratuitous. It’s refreshing. Risk-averse studios have in recent years responded to changing audience tastes by taking sex out of shows and films altogether, even romances. That’s just silly. What people want is better sex: more diverse scenes, which serve storytelling, reveal character and illustrate a specific connection.‘No one can know’: Heated Rivalry’s gay love story exposes ice hockey’s culture of silenceRead moreHeated Rivalry (like its BBC stablemateIndustry) gets it. Rozanov and Hollander’s intimate acts are power plays that track their attitudes to experience, aggression and risk. They reflect or complicate the couple’s standing on the public stage, in ways that can be wounding or tender. They’re bold, complex, unsteadily evolving. Everything you want from a good situationship.The public enemies, separated by country, can only meet around matches, shoots and award ceremonies. There’s a sweetness to the way they sext between locker rooms, against Hollander’s better judgment. “See you next season” becomes their bittersweet refrain. This distance gives their story the shape of a classic romance, trembling in hockey pads.Will there be a fairytale ending, or is this another onscreen gay story that ends in trauma and heartbreak? You’ll have to watch. As the story progresses over years, it reveals unexpected depth and humour, though. It should be a star vehicle for Storrie, enjoying his Slavic deadpan to the utmost. “Never in my life have I blushed. Russians do not do this” is a great line. It’s bested only by the impassioned moment in which he declares “I’m coming to the cottage!” which sounds bananas.Heated Rivalry may not be Doctor Zhivago, but it has shades of Challengers, Brokeback Mountain, even Rocky IV. I’m not sure a higher compliment exists. There was one downside to watching perfect bodies engaged in athletic coupling: a withering analysis of my own erotic performance, internalised as the voice of Roy Keane. If January’s cold weather and comfort eating have given you low self-esteem, beware. Baby, it’s cold outside, but it’s no picnic inside, either.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Add songs, many of Bruce Springsteen’s in this case, along with a few rounds of line dancing and a sizzling star in Billy Crudup. Still, it’s an odd experience initially as Thea Sharrock’s production switches from one brief filmic scene to the next, and the endeavour seems as wooden as the clapboard saloon-bar slats that comprise the handsome set.As a piece of theatre, it finds its flow. As a debate play, though, it gathers a locomotive energy as it travels towards the showdown between Frank Miller (James Doherty), who is returning to this “dirty little village in the middle of nowhere”, and the marshal Will Kane (Crudup) who put him behind bars. That is mostly because of the uncanny and urgent relevance of this 1952 film about a community working out (or rather, squirming out of) its civic responsibilities around institutional wrongdoing.Originally an allegory of McCarthyism (its screenwriter, Carl Foreman, was blacklisted), the story sets the cowardice of the many against the courage of the few – in this case, the lone, heroic Kane, who mobilises his defence against Miller and his henchmen after being let down by the townsfolk. The film was blasted by John Wayne as un-American for its critical portrait of the community; the production comes to life in its arguments on collective in/action and seems to speak directly about the dilemmas facing the cowboy country of Trump’s America (theshooting in Minneapolisjust the latest example). Eric Roth’s script uses many lines from Foreman’s screenplay but fleshes out the debates on the ethical stance of a community in the face of wrongdoing and misguided American myths around immigration.View image in fullscreenCowardice of the many, courage of the few … cast of High Noon.Photograph: Johan PerssonThere is also the joint talent of Crudup and the ever agileDenise Goughwho play the central couple on their wedding day. She is Amy Fowler, a Quaker who abhors the actions of violent men; he is the marshal who has just given up his “tin star” to start over as a shopkeeper. That is, until news reaches town that Miller is arriving on the noon train.Gary Cooper made the role entirely his own, his integrity comparable only to Gregory Peck’s Atticus in To Kill a Mockingbird. So Crudup has his long shadow to evade. He manages to hold up the part on stage as an upstanding, earnest and increasingly desperate man. Gough makes her part grittier and more modern than that of her film counterpart, Grace Kelly. The pair are convincing as a couple although their narrow characterisation hems in the full scale of their abilities.‘Pinnacle of westerns’: the Oscar-winning writer of Forrest Gump on staging High Noon – with songs by SpringsteenRead moreSeveral other characters seem too flimsy, from Billy Howle’s deputy marshal, Harvey Pell, to Rosa Salazar’s Mexican businesswoman, Helen, although the affinity between her and Amy is refreshing, and Roth gives more voice and texture to these women as a whole.Several of Springsteen’s songs bring their own American politics (from the frontier optimism of Land of Hope and Dreams to The Rising, written in response to 9/11). Some are sung a cappella, mostly by Gough, who is a strong singer, her voice emanating desolation, but she reprises I’m on Fire one too many times.It seems like a reluctant musical at times, the songs short and thin but the percussive music and sound design are always arresting, as is the lighting, designed by Neil Austin, which brings emotional clarity and intrigue. A clock is central to Tim Hatley’s set design, counting down to the train’s thrilling arrival and the subsequent showdown, which manages to contain tension and drama, despite the difficulty of staging a cross-town shootout.For all its early stiffness, it builds in momentum and there are moving moments. Ultimately, the political message speaks loudest, harnessing the McCarthyist fear of then and the Trumpian terror of today.At theHarold Pinter theatre, London, until 6 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreWesternsDenise GoughWest EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

Anders Hillborg took the principle as inspiration for his composition Exquisite Corpse but, where the surrealists hoped for signs of an unconscious collective sensibility, the emerging components of Hillborg’s piece bear his consciously singular imprint while also incorporating references to composers as disparate as Stravinsky, Ligeti and Sibelius.In the performance given by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under their chief conductorRyan Bancroft, the unfolding layers of sound were never less than brilliantly alive. Hillborg’s instinct for a remarkable range of instrumental colour – delicate tendrils of harmony, monstrously growling bass registers, insistent conga drumming, shrill piccolos – taunted and teased the ear before finally fading into a gentle haze.Sibelius’s Lemminkäinen Suite Op 22 made for an intriguing and blackly surreal connection, since in the Swan of Tuonela – second of the sequence of four tone poems based on episodes from the Kalevala, Finland’s national epic – the shamanic demigod hero Lemminkäinen is killed and his body dismembered. This exquisite corpse is then lovingly restored to life by his mother so that he can return home in triumph. Eliciting very fine string playing, with Amy McKean’s cor anglais solo most evocative, Bancroft found a balance between the narrative drama and the intoxicating, elemental quality of Sibelius’ score, while also creating a positively symphonic overall trajectory.Between these two works came Shostakovich’s Cello Concerto No 2, Op 126 in G major in which the soloist was the magnificent Alban Gerhardt. In his hands, it was the music’s melancholy beauty rather than the implicitly tragic vein that came across so hauntingly, the writing high on the A string impeccably delivered, and, in the Allegretto movement, Shostakovich’s bleakly sardonic rhythmic bite precision-honed. After such an intense experience, nothing was more heartwarming than seeing Gerhardt, modest cello-hero, join the back of the cello section to play in the Sibelius suite. Just for the hell of it.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC National Orchestra of WalesWalesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was announced days after the release of his 26th and final album, Blackstar, which has since been interpreted as an expression of the artist’s impending mortality.‘A perplexing, astonishing finale’: world pays tribute to David Bowie a decade after his deathRead moreWhen Bowie died, Hilton said her brother sent her a text in the morning that said: “Are you OK?” She said: “I thought: ‘What’s he going on about?’ and then I put the TV on. Well, that was it. I couldn’t go to work for two weeks. I had lilies and a candle burning. I was crying and it went on for about a month. It was like losing everything in my life.”Julian Furnival braved the chilly weather to lay flowers at the mural. “It don’t matter what the weather is going to say, we’re always going to come here and pay our respects to him,” said the 68-year-old, who appeared emotional as he stuck stickers on the glass protecting the memorial.Furnival said he has been a Bowie fan since he received a copy of Aladdin Sane for Christmas when he was 13 years old. He still remembers the day when the Starman’s passing was announced. “It still rubs in pretty bad. Our niece phoned us up at 6.30am and said it happened. We didn’t believe it but then we turned the telly on. It was really upsetting. It was a big shock,” he said.View image in fullscreenJulian Furnival with Laura Hough.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianHis partner, Laura Hough, 69, has scrawled the names of fans from around the world on the memorial on their behalf. The couple have yet to listen to Blackstar. “We’ve never had the guts to play it all because my son says it’s a very solemn album,” said Furnival. Hough agrees: “Knowing he was in so much pain but still doing it, he’s just amazing.”Sisters Jenny Wasiak, 65, a train conductor who travelled to Brixton from Norwich, and Astrid Ballhorn, 74, who is retired, came to “spend the day doing all things Bowie to do what we can to remember and love him”.“We don’t like a lot of each other’s music but as far as David is concerned, he’s our favourite,” said Ballhorn. “We adore and love David and miss him dearly,” said Wasiak. “We came here the year he died.”View image in fullscreenJenny Wasiak and Astrid Ballhorn (right).Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianReflecting on his legacy, Wasiak described Blackstar as an “amazing” and “moving” parting gift. “He gave something to everybody, explaining that he’s dying. It was very moving and a brilliant piece of music as well,” she said.David Bowie’s childhood home to open to public after 1960s restorationRead more“He’s such an iconic legend who influenced everybody,” Ballhorn said.“If you listen to musicians speaking, they nearly all reference David in some way or another.”“I was listening to an interview the other day that compared him to Beethoven. He’s the Beethoven of our day. It’s a class of music that will live on for 200 years or more” she said. “It seems incredible to think that we lost him 10 years ago.“He was a genius, there’ll never be anybody else like him.”Explore more on these topicsDavid BowiePop and rockLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then I heard Michael Stipe’s lyrics and was set on a path to freedomPerry Bulwer; as told toKitty DrakeSat 10 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 06.15 ESTShareIn 1991, I was living in a commune with 200 other people in Japan, as a member of a cult called the Children of God, which preached that the world was going to end in 1993. Everything I did – from where I slept each night, to who I was allowed to sleep with – was decided by the head of my commune. I was encouraged to keep a diary, and then turn it over to the leaders every night, so they could comb through it for signs of dissent. I was only allowed to listen to cult-sanctioned music, and I was only allowed to watch movies with happy endings, because those were the types of films of which the cult’s supreme leader – David Berg – approved. The Sound of Music was one of Berg’s favourite films, so we watched it on repeat.By the time I was living in Japan, I was in my mid-30s, and I’d been part of the cult for 20 years. I was indoctrinated by a young hippy couple when I was 16, and persuaded to run away from my family and join a sect of the cult near my home town in Canada. I was a lonely teenager and desperately searching for some kind of meaning. Everybody I knew worked in the lumber mill in my small town, and the thought that I was doomed to live that life scared the hell out of me. The first time I visited the commune, everyone hugged me when I walked in, just to say “hello”. It was intoxicating.But by 1991, after two decades in the cult, my faith was weakening. It was becoming clearer to me that Berg was wrong about the world ending in 1993. A whole series of events that were meant to directly precede the Second Coming hadn’t happened, and Berg – who lived in secrecy and communicated with his followers by written “prophecies” – kept issuing increasingly unconvincing excuses.I was also becoming more resistant to the way the cult leaders sought to control the most intimate parts of my life. When I joined the cult, it was very sexually conservative. If you wanted to date another member of the community, you had to ask for permission from the leadership. But as the years went by, Berg started preaching a doctrine of sexual freedom, and ordering his members to couple-swap. I had got married to another cult member in the 1980s, and was living with her in a Children of God commune in Japan. Because I resisted couple-swapping I was forcibly separated from my wife as a punishment – and ordered to live in a different commune on my own.There was also an even darker side to the Children of God that I was trying to shut my eyes to. Berg had released a written decree which permitted adult cult members to have sex with children. I never witnessed any sexual contact with children, and while I did read that decree when it was released in the 1980s, I refused to accept it. Still, it horrified me.Forcibly separated from my wife, and with Berg’s teachings becoming more twisted, I was in a state of spiritual turmoil. But it was only when I heard REM’s song Losing My Religion that I was pushed to action. Cult members were allowed to own Walkmans, because the Children of God released their own music on cassette, but we were forbidden from listening to “worldly” music. As my will to blindly obey crumbled, I began to secretly tune in to the American armed forces radio station that broadcast in Japan. (Technically, I’d always had the power to covertly listen to music this way, but it’s a sign of how indoctrinated I was that I had never allowed myself to do so before.) One day, Losing My Religion came on, and I remember hearing it for the first time and freezing. I physically stopped walking.My cultural awakening: The Lehman Trilogy helped me to live with my sight lossRead moreIt was that lyric, ”That’s me in the spotlight / Losing my religion”, that shook me. Hearing that line was the first time I’d even had words for what was happening to me. Then I heard the lyric, “Every whisper of every waking hour / I’m choosing my confessions”, and I began to think about the way the leaders made us write those daily diaries of our feelings, and then hand them over for inspection. I had learned to self-censor, because I was afraid that expressing my real feelings and doubts would result in punishment. I had been “choosing my confessions” for many years.In 1991, Losing My Religion was a brand new song and the radio station had it on heavy rotation. Every day I’d go on my walk and hear it again, and at first, it made me terrified. I was a 36-year-old high school dropout with no possessions, and I had nothing to go back to. You had to turn all your money over to the cult, so I had barely anything to my name. But with every re-listen, I became more determined to leave. It took me about five months, but I finally escaped the commune in the autumn of 1991. I moved back in with my parents, and ended up training to become a lawyer, but I have remained haunted by my decades with the cult. I’ve spent my career advocating for the children who were abused by Berg and some of his followers.A few years ago, I was surprised to learn that according to REM frontman Michael Stipe, Losing My Religion isn’t about someone losing faith at all; it’s about unrequited love. He explained that the phrase is a common expression in the American south “meaning to lose one’s temper or civility, or to feel frustrated and desperate”. However, like poetry, songs are open to the interpretation of listeners who apply their own meanings to the lyrics. I applied that song to my own life and everything changed.Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

A global portrait of people and their rides, from Shanghai to Santa MonicaYou can tell a lot about someone from the vehicle they drive, as Martin Roemers’ collection of photographs show. Introduction by author William BoydWilliam BoydSat 10 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 16.47 ESTShareIn my novels I find that I very rarely write “a car” or “a van” or “a lorry” – I always tend to specify the marque and the model, often with some pedantic precision. Why should this be so? After all, I am a non-driver, someone who claims to be able to drive (I did learn), but who never passed his driving test. And yet, paradoxically, I’m something of a car enthusiast – a sort-of petrol-head, I confess – perhaps a consequence of spending many hours, or maybe that should be years,  in the back of minicabs that conveyed me here and there around London. In my long experience of minicab use I’ve found that most conversations with minicab drivers often end up being about cars. I’ve learned a lot.There is another reason why I like to specify. I have a conviction that the type of car, or vehicle, that you drive is as much an expression of your personality as the clothes you wear or the decor of the home you call your own. Even the blandest of mid-price cars – the Toyota Prius, the Kia Picanto, the Volkswagen Jetta, for example – are making a covert statement about you, the owner. You chose that car – and your choice is surprisingly eloquent.View image in fullscreenTailors Bhola and Akash in a Piaggio van in Nashik, Maharashtra, IndiaView image in fullscreenDrag queens Sasha and Brett with a Toyota in Santa Monica, California, USAll this is by way of a preamble to Martin Roemers’ Homo Mobilis, a remarkable series of photographs of people posed with the various vehicles they drive. Moreover, these photographs, I would claim, bear out the thesis that the car, the van, the lorry, and so forth, are an extension of, and a window to, their owner’s personality and, quite possibly, an indication of their value system as well.Roemers has ranged far and wide to photograph the various vehicles that catch his eye. Among the many countries he’s visited are the US, India, Ukraine, Senegal, the Czech Republic, China and the Netherlands. And the type of vehicle he photographs is equally eclectic – not just cars and trucks but also campervans, invalid trikes, handcarts and minibuses, people-carriers, ice-cream vans and tractors, road-rollers, donkey-carts, motorbikes and hearses. The variety of vehicles on display is astonishing but one’s eye is inevitably more drawn to the eccentric: the mud-splattered, multi-dented taxis, the rust-badged family saloons, the lurid paint-blistered lorries, the MOT-challenged, spavined minibuses.However, Roemers’ stroke of genius is to have removed the geographical and urban context of the vehicles in his photographs. Richard Avedon shot his famous 1985 series of portraits, In the American West, with the subjects seated in front of a completely neutral, starkly white backcloth. The effect was to concentrate all attention on the sitter. These human beings became entirely what they presented to the camera lens – there was no distraction, no prop or identifier beyond the features of their face and whatever items of clothing were visible. It was a uniquely desolate and unsettlingly graphic form of portraiture.View image in fullscreenSpecial forces lieutenant Maksym returning to Lviv, Ukraine, from the frontline in his ToyotaView image in fullscreenCourier Sanju in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, IndiaRoemers has cleverly adopted the same technique and has isolated his vehicles and their owners and passengers by erecting a huge white cloth backdrop draped over an armature of scaffolding and has parked the cars and trucks in front of it. The vans and lorries, three-wheeled scooters and autorickshaws look as if they’re stuck in some vast, empty snow-field. It’s the same Avedon-effect: all concentration is focused on the vehicle and its textures and patinas, its colours and contents, in a way that makes them seem more like an art installation or some form of bizarre modern sculpture. The fact that these images are, effectively and essentially, about modes of transport seems secondary. It’s the aesthetic dividend that resonates in these photographs. Never has a decrepit jalopy looked more intriguing, and, in a strange way, shot in this manner, it has become a beautiful object in its own right – its form suddenly separate from its mundane function.The one further observation I have is not so much a critique but a kind of compliment. Roemers’ unique vehicle photographs could run and run, as it were – the subject matter is almost infinite, after all – but one finds oneself wondering if the demographic could be extended. The cars, taxis and lorries in these photographs are largely owned by poorer, hard-working people as their scuffed and dilapidated means of transport testify. What would Roemers make of soccer-moms in their huge 4x4s? Or executive chauffeurs with their glossy Mercedes S-Class limos or 7 Series BMWs? Or well-heeled boy-racers with their Lamborghinis and Maseratis? Or cyclists with their bicycles? It’s a tribute to the complete success of this photographic enterprise that we can ask for more, please.The writer Stephen Bayley, in his book Death Drive, declared that: “Cars have a talismanic quality. No other manufactured object has the same disturbing allure. More emotions are involved in cars than in anything else we make or use.” Roemers’ work in Homo Mobilis establishes the truth of that statement and also that the allure of a given vehicle doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with price or design or exclusivity. “We are what we eat” is a tried and tested truism; these superb photographs establish that “we are whatever we drive” is just as valid..Homo Mobilis (Lannoo Publishers) is priced at £50.

It was 7am and photographer Kelli Radwanski was after the morning light; Weir had another child on the way and had hired Radwanski to capture their family life. All the kids were feeling playful, ready to show off their talents, silly faces and prize possessions. As the eldest son wandered into the frame, holding his pot-bellied pig, Radwanski captured the moment – while sitting in her office chair in Oregon.‘My photos are warm and full of imagination – that’s something AI could never achieve’: Yuan Li’s best phone pictureRead more“Remote photography was developed during the pandemic and a handful of us still use it as one of our primary art forms,” Radwanski says. “I used a special app that took over Sara’s phone camera, an iPhone 13, and the day before the shoot she showed me around her home from the phone, so I could seek out light and vignettes that would be compelling in telling their story. We used a tall standing tripod to hold the phone and I had Sara place it where I wanted it to go. It worked beautifully for moving all five of them in and out of scenes. I’ve photographed more than 500 people in 14 countries this way.”The little boy’s pig is called Ronald, “named after one of the Weasleys, of course”, Radwanski adds. “They’re a family of redheads; I believe that is why they chose Ronald.

Fears of an “AI bubble” have been voiced by people from thegovernor of the Bank of Englandto thehead of Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Even if you have not actively invested in technology shares, the chances are you have some exposure to companies operating in the sphere. Even if you do not, a collapse could take down other companies’ values.So should you be worried about an AI bubble? And what can you do to protect yourself? Here are five things you need to know.Bubbles are hard to predictYou never know if there has been a bubble until after the event, says Daniel Casali, the chief investment strategist at the wealth management company Evelyn Partners, and if Guardian Money could predict the peaks and troughs in the stock market you would be the first to know (shortly before we all cashed in and retired).Some commentators suggest investors are currently paying too much for technology stocks because of misplaced expectations about how much the companies will make from developments in AI.However, others argue that this is not the case. Bankers at UBS, for example, had positive predictions for AI in their year ahead report. Acknowledging risks in the sector, they pointed to the capacity for much more spending on the technology. This could underpin further gains for AI-linked shares in 2026, they said.Even if these companies do turn out to be overvalued, it could take time for that to play out. At the moment AI technology is developing quickly, and for every setback there could be another breakthrough.It is unwise to make decisions based purely on an assumption that a bubble is about to burst.View image in fullscreenFears of an AI bubble have been voiced by people from the governor of the Bank of England to the head of Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Photograph: Christian Ohde/AlamyA collapse could affect you“If the bubble is in AI then it does not stop there with the sell-off – all other boats will start to sink as well,” Casali says. “You start to get contagion. A sell-off in AI will affect everything.”If there is a collapse it seems obvious that the value of companies that had promised future profits would come from using AI would take a hit. For those unconnected to the industry it’s about confidence. “Confidence is everything,” Casali says. “If investors lose confidence then so do businesses and consumers.”A global stock market crash could have an impact on your job, on the banking sector – in December the Bank of Englandwarned of risks to financial stability– and on the wider economy. Any investments you have in stocks and shares, held directly or through your Isa or pension that you might not keep close tabs on, could fall in value.View image in fullscreenDo you have any investments in stocks and shares held through an Isa?Photograph: Leonora Oates/AlamyTechnology stocks are likely to fall furthest and you may have money in them without knowing it. Dan Coatsworth, the head of markets at the investment platform AJ Bell, says: “Some people might think the key to not having too much exposure to US-listed AI stocks is to go with a global equity tracker fund. What they might not realise is that the US is full of tech names, and the geography accounts for a large chunk of the global market, such as 72% of the MSCI World index.”No losses until you cash inThat said, when it comes to pensions or investments you only make a real loss after a stock market fall if you sell the shares.In your planning, and reaction to market gyrations, you should think in terms of years, not weeks or months.“Pensions are the ultimate long-term investment, and it is important not to let speculation or short-term volatility force you into making kneejerk reactions that you may come to regret,” says Helen Morrissey, the head of retirement analysis at the advisers Hargreaves Lansdown.Morrissey says that by making “snap decisions” to stop contributing or change investments you risk crystallising losses and “it can make it harder to build your pension back up when markets recover”.If you are getting close to retirement and saving in a workplace pension, then there is a good chance that your money is invested in something called a lifestyling fund.There is a lot to be said for staying invested through the ups and downs of marketsLCP’s Steve Webb“This aims to protect your pension by moving you out of equities into assets such as bonds the closer you get to retirement, so you may find you are less impacted by market falls than you thought,” Morrissey says. “If you are concerned then you may choose to delay retirement for a while until things get better or speak to a financial adviser about the best approach.”With your Isa this will not happen but, again, in the event of a downturn you will not have real losses unless you withdraw the money.Steve Webb, a partner at the pension consultants LCP, says that for younger people who own shares “there is a lot to be said for staying invested through the ups and downs of markets, on the basis that in the long run you are likely to see your savings grow, and it’s very hard to ‘time the markets’ in any case”.If you are worried about an investment bubble bursting, Tom Francis, the head of personal finance at Octopus Money, says to ask yourself what it is that is making you feel uneasy. “If the answer is that you’ll need this money in the next few years, that’s a clear signal that you might be invested too riskily for such a short timeframe,” he says.“If you don’t need the money any time soon but hate seeing your investments fall in value, that’s just a natural part of investing,” he adds. “Over the long term, markets have tended to perform well and time is usually your biggest ally.”The same is true for gainsWith stock markets near record highs, you may feel it is a good time to cash in investments and lock in any gains.“For those close to retirement, and particularly anyone thinking of using their pension pot to buy an annuity, locking in current high valuations is worth considering,” Webb says. However, he has a word of caution: “Inevitably, there is a risk that you might come out of the market and see values continue to rise.”You need to weigh up whether the financial hit of missing out on further rises is bigger than the potential loss from a crash. Sadly, a financial adviser is unlikely to be able to tell you the best time to cash in, but they should be able to help you put the risks and rewards in context.Diversification is best“If there’s one principle that never goes out of style in investing, it’s diversification,” says Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Spreading investments across different sectors and asset classes remains the simplest and most effective way to guard against surprises.”Francis says you should have an emergency fund of three to six months’ expenses then “diversify your investments rather than betting on one hot stock, and invest for the long term – ideally five years or more. Doing these three things can help you drown out the noise without panicking when markets wobble.”According to Britzman, no investor will be truly immune to a stock market correction caused by an AI bubble bursting: “The tech sector is so intertwined in markets globally that it’s feasible to suggest all assets could wobble in this situation.”With this in mind he says the challenge “is to find ways to make your Isa or pension portfolio fall by less than the broader market, and that means considering lower-risk investments, ones with safe haven qualities like gold, or less glamorous sectors that generate strong cashflows.”Britzman says companies that might prove popular with investors are found in sectors such as insurance, utilities, food producers, household goods and telecoms. “Many will pay dividends, and their earnings are more predictable. Investors are often happy to pay a premium for these types of companies in a market downturn.”View image in fullscreenGold is deemed a safe haven asset.Photograph: Hiba Kola/ReutersCasali says gold has proved a very reliable investment, and there are reasons to believe this will be true in a crash. He adds that short-term government bonds are another asset to consider – these bonds, also known as gilts, are the government’s way of borrowing money and pay a fixed rate of interest to investors.“One- to two-year gilt yields are driven by the Bank of England base rate,” he says. In the event of a crash, the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates, and that will make the returns on those gilts look good.There are funds that give you access to these assets. One way to hold gold with household names such as Unilever, Visa and Nestlé is to invest in the Trojan Fund, which is available via lots of Isa platforms. The Royal London Short-Term Money Market Fund is an investment that offers access to short-term government bonds.If you want a global tracker fund but want to reduce your exposure to the US tech companies, Coatsworth says another option is a global equity tracker that excludes the US, such as Xtrackers MSCI World ex USA.Explore more on these topicsInvestmentsAI (artificial intelligence)Stock marketsSavingsInvestingTechnology sectorInvestment fundsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s even more embarrassing than my previous ailments – ‘hot hand’ and ‘phantom phone’Tim DowlingSat 10 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 16.38 ESTShareIwake up with a headache. Not a headache, really – more of a head pain, and not exactly that either. I am sitting in the kitchen opposite the middle one, who is staring at his computer. My wife is wandering in and out, not really listening to the symptoms I’m trying to describe.“It’s like I walked through a low doorway and cracked my skull on the frame,” I say.“Ow,” my wife says.“Except I haven’t done that,” I say. “Or it feels more like an invisible hand is holding me up by the hair.”“Look it up,” my wife says.“Don’t tell him to look it up!” says the middle one.“Why not?” my wife says.“Because he’ll look it up!” he says.“Anyway, it’s slowly migrating across my head,” I say, “from back left to right front.”“So go to the doctor,” my wife says, wandering out before I answer.“I’m not telling a GP that ghosts are pulling my hair,” I say. “That’s worse than hot hand, or phantom phone.”These are two of my previous embarrassing ailments. Hot hand was slightly misnamed, because the hand itself – my right one – did not get hot; it just made things seem hot to the touch, when they clearly weren’t. Fortunately it went away before I was obliged to describe its symptoms to a professional. Phantom phone – in which a creaking hip joint creates the false impression that the phone in my pocket is receiving a text – is just something I’ve learned to live with.“I can’t help you if you won’t help yourself,” my wife says.“Anyway, I think it might be a spasm of the tiny muscles above my forehead,” I say.AI suggests my condition is either fatal or a shampoo allergy“What, from raising your eyebrows too much?” she says.“Could be,” I say. “It’s been one of those weeks.”“Muscle tension leading to pains to the scalp,” says the middle one. “Caused by trapped nerve, stress, or poor posture.”“Did you just look that up?” I say.Over the course of the afternoon the scalp pain abates a little, but my mood does not improve. By evening I’m looking for things to complain about. I find myself rifling through kitchen drawers, incensed.“How have we gone from being a family rich in scissors,” I say, “to a family with no scissors at all?” The oldest one, watching football on his laptop, snorts derisively.“It’s ridiculous!” I say, yanking open the dishwasher. “Oh, wait, they’re all in here.”By bedtime my scalp problem has also become a neck problem, which is in its own way reassuring: I’ve had neck problems before.But the pain makes it difficult to get to sleep. When I finally do, I dream I’m visiting a doctor in a vast crowded room filled with desks and snaking queues. When the doctor asks me what the problem is, I say I have a sore throat.“You were too embarrassed to tell the truth, even in a dream?” my wife says the next morning.“In the dream I had a sore throat,” I say. “But it does feel like a squandered opportunity.”“To take advice from a doctor in a dream?” she says.“It’s better than asking AI,” I say.Actually, it’s almost exactly the same as asking AI, which suggests my condition is either fatal or a shampoo allergy. When I look from my computer to the window I see my wife gardening. Reluctantly, I stand up and step outside. My wife is on her knees clearing weeds from the beds.“Staring?” she says, without turning around.“I was just coming to see if you needed any …”“You could get the hedge trimmer and cut all those bushes into ball shapes,” she says.I can tell after finishing the first bush that the effort is not helping my neck, but when it comes to this sort of thing my wife knows I harbour a perfectionist streak – I can’t stop. By the time all the bushes are spherical, my neck problem has become a lower back problem.An hour later my wife finds me lying on the sofa.“I did a whole morning out there,” she says. “You did 35 minutes.”“And now I can’t move,” I say. Only after she leaves do I realise I should have asked her to pass the TV remote. I lie there in the gathering darkness thinking about simpler days, when I had no problems at all, except that my hand made things feel hot sometimes.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A second necessary tool in the month of January is the ability to dispose of or transform a swede into an evening meal. For the uninitiated, when roasted, the swede, that pretty, purple-creamed, dense little ball, is part-creamy, part carrot-like in nature, and earthy and sweet in flavour. It also takes to big-flavoured sauces such as this tomato, ginger and coconut curry like a chip to vinegar and couples up well with its seasonal pal, fresh, crunchy purple sprouting broccoli.Roast swede and purple sprouting broccoli curryI useMutti tomatoes, which are very finely chopped and which transform into a sauce much quicker than general chopped tomatoes. Other brands are available, of course, and may label their finely chopped tomatoes as rustic pomodoro.Prep15 minCook1 hr 10 minServes42 medium swedes(or 1 large swede; 1.2kg), peeled, halved and cut into wedges of 2cm at their widest pointRapeseed oil2 tsp fine sea salt1 large onion(or 2 medium ones), peeled and finely sliced6 garlic cloves, peeled and minced6cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and very finely chopped (45g)1½ tsp kashmiri chilli powder1 tsp ground turmeric400g tin finely chopped tomatoes, or rustic pomodoro2400ml tins coconut milk400g sprouting broccoli, florets kept whole, the rest cut into 2cm pieces20g bunch Thai basil, leaves pickedRice or flatbreads, to serveHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Toss the swede wedges with three tablespoons of oil and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, then spread out on an oven tray and roast for 35-45 minutes, turning once halfway, until soft, tender and golden at the edges. Remove, and leave the oven on.While the swede is roasting, put four tablespoons of oil in a wide, ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat and, when hot, add the onion and one and a quarter teaspoons of salt. Cook, stirring, until the onion is soft and turning golden brown, then stir in the garlic and ginger and cook for another two minutes. Add the kashmiri chilli and turmeric, then tip in the tinned tomatoes and coconut milk, cook for 10 minutes more, and take off the heat.Add the broccoli and roast swede to the curry sauce, stir to coat, then pop the pan in the oven for 15 minutes, until the broccoli is tender and everything is well coated in the sauce.Finely slice the Thai basil leaves, fold half of them into the curry, then scatter the rest over the top. Serve warm with rice or flatbreads.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodCurryWinter food and drinkHerbs and spicesTomatoesMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

But, perhaps, there is a third way. Enter –once again– the flare.The trouser shape, first popularised in the 70s and flirted with briefly five years ago, is back again in 2026. Resale app Depop says there has been a 30% increase in the searches for the style this month alone.If they were initially worn by hippies and dropouts at Woodstock in the 60s, this latest moment takes its cue from high-profile women who might be described as “alpha”.This week the TV presenterClaudia Winklemanwore a suit with flares that pooled over her shoes on The Traitors, while Hailey Bieber – previously the patron saint of baggy jeans – was photographed wearing a pair of flared trousers in LA.View image in fullscreenVictoria Beckham is among those who have made flares part of their signature wardrobe.Photograph: Nick Harvey/Rex/ShutterstockSome alpha celebrities have made flares part of their signature wardrobe – Jennifer Lopez and Victoria Beckham regularly wear flares, often with a blouse or T-shirt tucked in. Beckham chose to wear a version of this outfit in herrecent Netflix documentary. Donatella Versace, meanwhile, often wore flares with stilettos for her post-show bow.Sinead McKeefry, Winkleman’s stylist forThe Traitors, says the Essentiel Antwerp suit worked for the presenter because it had a “chicness … I love to see flares not always considered to be 60s or 70s thing … it’s a very modern take on the flare.”Daniel Rogers, the fashion news editor at Vogue, agrees flares have now moved on from boho chic. “I think these are about looking smart and polished, and being more more dressy with it,” he said.Footwear is central to the alpha flare, Rogers adds. “You have to wear that kind of flare with a platform, or a spiky pointed stiletto peeking out from the bottom. I think that’s what makes it so assertive as a look.”This take on the flare is very far from its Woodstock roots. “I don’t wear flares and a high heel, so I don’t know, but I can’t imagine it’s a particularly practical look,” said Rogers. “It becomes a status thing. It says ‘I can wear this because I’m getting into an SUV in two minutes.’”As the Depop data suggests, flares are also being taken up by people who might use public transport. Rogers says this could mean flares are “2026’s answer to the barrel leg”.Essentiel Antwerp’s creative director and co-founder, Inge Onsea, agrees they are a third way in the current trouser wars. “They’re the perfect in-between,” she says “combining the definition of a slim trouser with the ease of a wider cut, which is exactly what makes them so flattering.”McKeefry, meanwhile, describes the look for Winkleman as a “palate cleanser … on this series, we’ve mixed knits and tartans and all the different patterns. Between all of those things, the simplicity of that suit gave me a moment to just breathe.”Onsea says flares bring a different mood for 2026. “After seasons dominated by oversized silhouettes, they bring back confidence,” she said. “Flares feel optimistic.”Explore more on these topicsFashionWomen's trousersClaudia WinklemanVictoria BeckhamThe TraitorsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The main town is beautiful, with buildings leading up a hill to an old castle. We rented a small apartment and spent our days on quiet pebble beaches that we had almost to ourselves. It’s a genuinely peaceful place where you can properly switch off from the noise of modern life.RoyA Corsican beach that never gets busyView image in fullscreenPlage de Péru.Photograph: Jon Ingall/AlamyOur favourite beach in Europe is Plage de Péru on Corsica. It can be reached by a pleasant downhill walk from the village of Cargèse, established by descendants of Greek immigrants from the Mani peninsula in the 18th century. However, we were lucky enough to have direct access from theHotel Thalassa, a sleepy hotel with balconies and a leafy garden facing the turquoise waters. There may be better beaches on Corsica but this one is perfect for swimming and never seems to get busy. You can spend a day walking from the beach to the local Genoese tower, then return and grab a seat at one of the beachpailotteswhere you can eat and drink while watching the sunset.EleanorHot sand and siestas in CataloniaView image in fullscreenPlaya el Morer, Sant Pol de Mar, near Barcelona.Photograph: Maria Jose Furio/AlamyThe train from Barcelona deposits its passengers right on Sant Pol de Mar’s harbour. The sound of gently bobbing rigging and the whiff of seafood drifts from the village, where the promise of a splendid lunch awaits. The Playa el Morer is reached on foot along a curving bay where frazzled city dwellers dig their heels in that hot, amber sand, and take a siesta and the occasional dip. Sant Pol, it seems, exists to mend broken hearts and heal the soul.LizTimeless charm in Akyaka, TurkeyView image in fullscreenA hotel on a crystal clear river in Akyaka.Photograph: AlamyOn a road trip through Turkey’s south-west, I stumbled upon Akyaka, a peaceful, pine-fringed village untouched by mass tourism. The Azmak River, so clear it seemed unreal, flowed past riverside cafes where I watched turtles drift by. Locals welcomed me like family and evenings meant fresh seafood and golden sunsets. The architecture – wooden houses with carved balconies – gave the town a timeless charm. Paddleboarding on the calm sea at sunrise was something I’ll never forget.DebbieStay cool on the Danish RivieraView image in fullscreenGilleleje, North Zealand.Photograph: Niels Quist/AlamyWho needs the scorching Med when you have the Danish Riviera. The water is clean and refreshing (no wetsuits allowed – you’ll be laughed off the beach). Danish summer hols are in July, so you’ll have the beach to yourself in August. Book a summer cottage near Gilleleje, a charming fishing village about an hour from Copenhagen. Denmark is expensive, so self-catering is best. Ice-cream at Hansens; lunch in Gilleleje harbour; culture atLouisiana modern art museumandHamlet’s Castlein Helsingør.ChristinaA quieter alternative to Capri, ItalyView image in fullscreenLa Corricella harbour in Procida.Photograph: Francesco Riccardo Iacomino/Getty ImagesProcida, in the Bay of Naples, is not as famous as nearby Capri and Ischia, but is all the more appealing for it. Not a tourist trap but an island where people actually live, it’s a delightful slice of unhurried Italian life. It’s small enough to explore on foot or by bicycle, and there is a bus service too. There are many pretty little beaches for swimming, sunbathing and picnicking – our favourite was Il Postino, where scenes from the movie of the same name were filmed. As people still fish for a living, there’s no shortage of wonderfully fresh seafood in the restaurants.Villa CaterinaB&B’s orchard of lemon and orange trees provides fresh juice and marmalade for breakfast, and the rooms have views of the island and the bay, with Vesuvius looming in the distance and Naples only 45 minutes away by ferry.Bernie GSeafood and sunsets in the Vendée, FranceView image in fullscreenThe beach at Les Sables d’Olonne in the Vendée.Photograph: Julien Leiv/Getty ImagesWe had a wonderful week in Les Sables d’Olonne in the Vendée. The town has plenty of sights – theshell museumwas well worth a trip – and there are many seafood restaurants. The main beach (La Grande Plage) is extremely popular and has beignet and glace-sellers and beach volleyball. However, we found ourselves gravitating to the less busy Plage de la Paracou, smaller and more rugged, no tourist trappings and wonderful sunsets. There was also a fantastic small open-air bar just over the dune, which had great live acoustic music a few nights a week.DollyPebble coves and olive groves on Silba, CroatiaView image in fullscreenA quiet bay on Silba.Photograph: Jure Gasparic/AlamyI didn’t know much about Silba before I arrived (on a catamaran from Zadar) – it’s a small, car-free island with no hotels, just family-run guesthouses. You can walk on shaded paths through olive groves, find quiet pebble coves with clear water for swimming and climb the Toreta tower at sunset for great views of the Adriatic. My tip: bring a snorkel, stay at least two nights and be sure to book your return ferry in advance, as schedules are limited.ElaineRAIL JOURNEYS TO REMEMBERThe night train from Belgrade to Lake SkadarView image in fullscreenRailway passing Lake Skadar.Photograph: Simon Dux/AlamyWe took a sleeper from Belgrade (after a few days exploring this cool, arty city) and loved the old-school velvety cabins with corridors and big open windows. We woke up to stunning Lake Skadar on the Montenegro-Albania border. After a few days exploring the lake, the ruined hill town of Stari Bar and Montenegro’s beautiful coastline, we headed back up to Belgrade by day – the mountainous scenery on this 11-hour journey is spectacular, and all for €50 round trip. We used theMan at Seat 61to learn about the route.JennyInterrail to MoroccoWe travelled from the UK to Morocco via train and ferry, stopping in Girona and Córdoba, both of which have picturesque old towns. In Córdoba we visited eight stunning courtyard gardens as well as thePalace of Vianaand theMezquita, surely one of the most astonishing buildings in the world. On the return leg we stopped in Málaga and Montpellier, both characterful places. We would have missed out on these wonderful destinations if we had flown directly to Marrakech.LouiseAnywhere in Belgium for €8.50View image in fullscreenAntwerp station.Photograph: StockByM/Getty ImagesLast year, my wife and I explored Belgium by train, staying in an apartment near Antwerp station, a fantastic cathedral to the railways containing several pink granite columns and panels, polished in our home town of Aberdeen. In Belgiumover-65s can buy a day return ticketto anywhere in the country for just €8.50. We visited several towns and cities, and discovered the Unesco-listedFlemish Béguinages– medieval communities composed of houses, churches and green spaces for widows or unmarried women, many now beautifully restored.Jim FiddesGlorious north Wales rail circuitView image in fullscreenAn aerial view towards the railway bridge at Barmouth.Photograph: Nicola Pulham/AlamyStarting in Shrewsbury, a spectacular multi-day circuit of north Wales is possible: take theCambrian Coast linethrough Aberystwyth, Barmouth and Porthmadog, then the gorgeousFfestiniog Railwayto Blaenau, where you can link back to Llandudno on the coast, and return to Shrewsbury (change at Llandudno Junction). There is no shortage of accommodation, allowing you to stop and explore without rigid planning. Out of summer the Cambrian coast and the seaside towns are unexplored jewels.Dave ThomasLaid-back vibes on the line to LjubljanaView image in fullscreenLjubljana.Photograph: Jan Wlodarczyk/AlamyAfter days getting blissfully lost in the quiet alleys and forgotten courtyards of Venice, we boarded the train from Santa Lucia station and sped across the shimmering lagoon to Trieste. In a sunlit square, we savoured chocolate gelato, the Mediterranean sparkling nearby. Next was laid-back Ljubljana, where we sipped cocktails by the river, surrounded by art and colour. Finally, a graffiti-covered train carried us toLake Bled, where we hiked and swam beneath the majestic Julian Alps, ending our journey in a cosy glamping pod under the stars and amid fireflies.AlexA perfect triangle inFranceView image in fullscreenThe Gare du Nord, Paris.Photograph: Sylvain Sonnet/Getty ImagesMy wife and I have travelled around a lot of Europe but our best trip for simplicity is a triangle of France: the Eurostar to Paris, then theTGV to Toulousefor saucisse and architectural and historical delights; next, theslow train to Bayonne, gazing at the Pyrenees as the train trundles past Lourdes, and on to the French Basque coast; then theTGV back up to Paris. City, gastronomy, mountains and beach all in one.GeorgeRome to Sicilyby train and ferryHop on the sleeper in Rome, or perhaps Naples, and wake the next morning in Sicily. There’s no bridge (yet) so the train is loaded on to a ferry for the crossing while you are sound asleep in one of the functional little compartments. You can go direct all the way to Palermo or beautiful Syracuse in the south-east of the island.PollyOFF THE BEATEN TRACK ADVENTURESCabin life on a Finnish lakeView image in fullscreenLake Saimaa in eastern Finland.Photograph: Mikko Turunen/Getty ImagesOne of the most magical places I’ve been is Lake Saimaa in eastern Finland – a labyrinth of islands and forests where you don’t come across many people. We rented a lakeside cabin and watched the midnight sun shimmer across peaceful waters. Days were spent kayaking between islets or hiking pine-scented trails, with only the call of black-throated divers (or loons) for company. We visited theLinnansaari national parkin the middle of the vast lake, where encounters with rare Saimaa ringed seals await. It’s nature’s embrace at its purest – remote, quiet and utterly rejuvenating.AnthonyRiverside camping in Portugal’s mountainsView image in fullscreenFun on the River Alva.Photograph: Constantino Sousa/AlamyThe sleepy villages of the Serra da Estrela, continental Portugal’s highest mountain range, are a world away from its coastal honeypots. In Vila Cova à Coelheira there is a free campsite on the banks of the River Alva, reached via an old Roman bridge that you can swim under (or jump in from, if you’re feeling brave). Even better, there is a bar at the river beach that serves excellentpica-pau– pork braised in wine with onions and pickles.DavidTrue remoteness in Scotland’s Outer HebridesView image in fullscreenGatliff Hebridean hostel.Photograph: Annett Doering/AlamyFor an experience of true remoteness, I’d recommend the Hebridean island of Berneray, between North Uist and Harris. Here you can walk across the rare grassland called the machair to the white, three-mile longWest beachand marvel at the immense space and colour of the Atlantic. We stayed atGatliff Hebridean hostel, which consists of two converted crofts where, for about £20 a night for a bunk, you will be staying in one of the most peaceful locations in the world.Nik FerneeQuiet beauty in MontenegroView image in fullscreenBlack Lake in the Durmitor national park.Photograph: Christian Sturzenegger/Getty ImagesIn autumn I visitedDurmitor national parkin northern Montenegro, a quiet and beautiful place in the Dinaric Alps. The road there passed through thick pine forests and opened on to wide valleys surrounded by tall, rocky mountains. I walked to the Black Lake (Crno Jezero), where the water was so still it perfectly reflected the autumn colours of the trees. In the hills, shepherds looked after their sheep, and small villages sold fresh cheese and honey. I also gazed down into Tara River canyon, one of Europe’s deepest gorges, and right at the bottom, several thousand feet below me, I could see the bright turquoise ribbon of the river.Lorna WalkdenA Unesco biosphere reserve near BarcelonaView image in fullscreenView from the top of Matagalls peak in the Montseny massif.Photograph: Cristian Zaharia/AlamyJust 40 miles from Barcelona lies aUnesco biosphere reserve, its peaks more than a thousand feet higher than Ben Nevis. The Montseny massif’s thick Mediterranean oak forests rise on all sides as you follow the single road threading its way up the horseshoe-shaped valley. About halfway up is the village of Montseny itself. Stop for a hike on any of the trails, followed by an ice-cream at Can Manel, a small bar with a big terrace and enormous views.LeoCroatia’s Mljet island is not for the jet setView image in fullscreenSnorkelling in the clear waters off Mljet island.Photograph: Joao Inacio/Getty ImagesIt’s only a few miles off the coast of Dubrovnik and its cruise-ship crowds, but Mljet feels like another world. Pine forests dip into turquoise bays, an ancient monastery sits on a tiny islet in the middle of a lake, and there’s hardly a sound beyond cicadas and the wind. I stayed in a simple family-run cottage just outside the national park, where evenings meant grilled fish on the terrace and nights under skies thick with stars. Days were spent kayaking across mirror-still water and walking through pine-scented trails where I rarely met another soul. It felt like stepping into a corner of Europe the 21st century has politely passed by.Mark AdamsonThe Romanian delta ‘on the edge of the world’View image in fullscreenA pelican colony in the Danube delta.Photograph: DPVUE/Getty Images/iStockphotoTheDanube deltamarks the eastern frontier of the EU and feels like the edge of the world. Accessible by boat from the port of Tulcea, it is one of Europe’s largest and most vital wetland ecosystems and is full of wildlife. We stayed at theDelta Boutique & Carmen Silva Resortin Crișan, an old working fishing village where tranquil evenings are broken only by the lively chorus of frogs. Guided boat safaris can be arranged via the hotel.JoshFAMILY HOLIDAYSAll aboard in the NetherlandsView image in fullscreenAmsterdam.Photograph: Alexander Spatari/Getty ImagesOur favourite family holiday was to the Netherlands: taking turns playing captain and guiding electric hire boats on canals; tilting our ice-cream cones at windmills at Zaanse Schans; cycling to the broad, clean beaches and cabanas; Amsterdam for the colourful Pride parade and counterpointed by a calming visit to De Poezenboot (which teen could resist a cat sanctuary on a canal boat?). And staying in Haarlem in an apartment with speedy wifi kept the teens happy while we indulged in morning strolls through medieval cobbled streets to Grote Markt for coffee and people-watching.AnnetteAn Italian castle at hostel pricesView image in fullscreenOstello il Castello di Santa Severa, north of Rome.Photograph: Maurizio Distefano/AlamyWhen I saw the picture ofOstello il Castello di Santa Severain the Guardian in 2019, I thought it was too good to be true, but it’s genuine. We have been twice with our teens, and sent friends too!A mile-long beach where teenagers can roam and paddleboard, an easy train journey to explore Rome, lunchtime pizza slices with locals cheering on the footie at L’Angolo delle Crepes. Plus the opportunity to sleep in a castle at hostel prices. Fluffy white towels aplenty, and a gleaming kitchen if you want to cook.Don’t miss the nearby necropolis for an Indiana Jones-style adventure. Fireworks over the castle and a hilarious Italian Beatles cover band were theciliegina sulla torta!MargaretMaking a splash in Austria’s lake districtView image in fullscreenWolfgangsee in the Austrian lake district.Photograph: Volkerpreusser/AlamySalzkammergut is the Austrian lake district. Lush meadows, forests and blue-green lakes make for endless days of swimming, biking and lying in the sun. Wolfgangsee has well-marked bike trails and opportunities to swim, alongside cafes serving deliciousKaiserschmarrn(fluffy pancakes) and schnitzel. Nearby Fuschlsee has an incredible water park right by the lake: swimming pools, slides and plenty of quiet water in which to swim. We stayed in the newly renovated Feichtingerbauer, which offers complimentary access to theFuschlseebad.NehaSlovenia’s raft of adventure activitiesView image in fullscreenVintgar gorge.Photograph: Unaihuizi/Getty ImagesWe started in Lake Bled. Our teens loved the Dolinka ziplines, the summer toboggan run, hiking in Vintgar gorge and swimming in the lake. You can hire paddleboards and boats. If you have the money, there is rafting and canyoning too. After seeing the incredible Postojna cave, we went up the Vogel cable by Lake Bohinj. Half-board at theBohinj Eco hotelkept us all amply fed and it also has an aquapark, bowling and plenty of games to boot. We finished the trip off with shopping in Ljubljana and the best ice-cream ever at Romantika.SueFamily-friendly camping in Pays de Loire, FranceI am a solo parent, andLe Domaine du Claryson the west coast of France has been our annual retreat since my daughter was three. The static caravans with decking offer a comfortable blend of camping and convenience. The parks, water slides and vibrant kids’ club activities provide endless fun for my daughter while I savour a few precious hours of calm or hire a bike to explore nearby towns such as Saint Jean de Monts. With friendly fellow travellers, it’s the perfect safe escape for a female adventurer.PaulaLaurie Lee inspired us to walk the Cotswold WayView image in fullscreenBroadway Tower on the Cotswold Way.Photograph: Lynne Nieman/AlamyAfter a family reading of Laurie Lee’sAs I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning, my husband and I decided our two teens were ready for a walking holiday in the Cotswolds. We set out on theCotswold Waywith backpacks and a tent, starting just outside lively Chipping Campden and ending in Bath. Mobiles were limited to an hour in the evening and we did 10 miles a day – covering the walk in 10 days. We felt part of a community of walkers as fellow hikers greeted us and shared drinks and tips along the way. We returned fitter, more together and happier than when we set out.AnnOompah bands and cable cars in BavariaView image in fullscreenHofbräuhaus am Platzl, Munich’s most famous beer hall.Photograph: Ross Helen/AlamyA two-centre holiday to Munich and Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria is a must with teenagers as there is so much to see and do. In Munich they loved the atmosphere in the beer halls – eating pretzels and listening to the oompah band and watching the Rathaus-Glockenspiel in the square. A visit to the Olympiapark is also recommended. In Garmisch-Partenkirchen there is a toboggan run, which is great fun, and nearby is the beautiful Zugspitze mountain and cable car, with boating on Eibsee lake.Richard WatkinsUNDER THE RADAR CITY BREAKSOlomouc, Czech RepublicView image in fullscreenOlomouc skyline.Photograph: Angelafoto/Getty Images/iStockphotoOlomouc is an utter delight. Gleaming spires and domes, two old town squares, enchanting cobbled lanes, trams and its own astronomical clock. It also has a Unesco-recognised holy trinity column, which was built to mark the end of a plague in the early 18th century. It’s a two-hour train ride from Prague but markedly less touristy. Two great places to enjoy a beer wereSaint Venceslav’s brewery, where there is a beer spa with a sauna scented with hops, andTwinburg, next to the Moravian cycle path, which serves delicious craft ales. I felt that this city had been put on Earth specially for me.Jack AndertonCity under the volcano, SicilyView image in fullscreenAlfresco Catania.Photograph: Robert Harding/AlamyA city brimming with life, Catania is a foodie haven and a great base to explore the island from. Home toarancini(deep fried rice balls) andcannoli (fried dough tubes filled with ricotta cheese), the city has incredible food experiences like the gelato fromDon Peppinuand sweet treats fromPasticceria Savia. It is also within striking distance of Mount Etna, as well as beautiful coastal destinations such as Taormina and Syracuse.GeorgePolar nights in Tromsø, Norway’s ‘Arctic capital’View image in fullscreenTromsø harbour and the Sandnessundet bridge.Photograph: Julia Lavrinenko/Getty ImagesAs a Scot who once sought drawn-out summer nights, I now lean into the opposite with fervour. Winter in Tromsø – the “Arctic capital” – is for travellers who embrace long, dark nights and are keen to meddle with their circadian rhythms. The polar night, when the sun doesn’t rise above the horizon, starts at the end of November and finishes in mid-January. Experience this unworldly extended twilight – the blue hour – from about 9am to 2pm. TheFjellheisencable car and silent whale-watching withBrim Explorerare two recommended activities.Aimee LawrenceWrocław, Poland’s buzzy student cityView image in fullscreenBeach bars in Wrocław.Photograph: Ingolf Pompe 19/AlamyWrocław has the perfect mix of quirkiness and beauty to make for a cracking, affordable city break. The hefty student population gives the city a real buzz, from the boat and beach bars along the River Oder (tryForma Płynnabeach bar), to the delicious Georgian bakeries (stop atPiekarnia Gruzińska PURIfor pastries on the way to checking out the painted backyards of the Nadodrze neighbourhood). While tourists concentrate around the huge central square, exploring the edge of the old town reaps rewards, likePub Drukarnia(delicious Litovel Czech beer) or Stacja Breslau bistro under the rail arches on Wojciecha Bogusławskiego street.Matt LuntExplore Jaén’s castles and cathedralView image in fullscreenJaén Cathedral.Photograph: Margouillat Photos/Getty ImagesThe city and the province of Jaén in Andalucía, Spain, can be overlooked by those heading to nearby Granada or Córdoba. That’s a shame, given that they are filled with Renaissance architecture, including a magnificent cathedral, and are renowned as a home of olive oil. Historically it held immense strategic importance due to its position between Christian Castilla and Muslim Granada, and it is surrounded by castles. I recommend staying at the Parador de Jaén, which sits at the top of the hill of Santa Catalina next to the castle. The views from its rooms towards the Sierra Morena mountains are unparalleled.FelixLeiden, a mini-Amsterdam with a buzzView image in fullscreenCanal in Leiden.Photograph: Xantana/Getty Images/iStockphotoLeiden – between the Hook of Holland and Amsterdam – is a fantastic destination easily reached by ferry from the UK. It offers everything Amsterdam does but on a smaller scale and has great places to stay, eat and enjoy. The mainly pedestrianised and historic town centre is beautiful, with a fantastic Saturday market along the canals. The large student population helps keep the city lively all year round.Ruud Jansen VenneboerWONDERS WORTH TRAVELLING FORGhosts of Knidos in south-west TurkeyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kenansavas/Getty ImagesWe’ve only ever reached the ancient Greek city of Knidos by sea, dropping anchor by the silted harbour that once sheltered a fleet of triremes (ancient war galleys). At night, when the few tourists who come here have gone, the toga-wrapped ghosts return. From our boat, we could feel them, roaming the mile upon mile of steep, ruined streets and collapsed temples; rising up out of the sea 30 miles west of modern Datça, to haunt the vast, crumbling metropolis which grew rich on sea trade before earthquakes and war returned it to dust and the crickets. Magnificent.Kay JonesGaelic island gem in County Kerry, IrelandView image in fullscreenThe monastic settlement at Skellig Michael.Photograph: Francesco Riccardo Iacomino/Getty ImagesThe sixth-century monastery and its tiny garden on top of Skellig Michael is an extraordinary place. The wind can howl up the sides of this mountain island, but climb the rocky stairs to the collection of ancient stone domed huts in the small depression on top and it is out of this world.ChrisWell worth its salt, KrakówView image in fullscreenWieliczka salt mine.Photograph: Gatsi/Getty Images/iStockphotoTheWieliczka salt minejust outsideKrakówis an architectural masterpiece and a Unesco world heritage site steeped in the history of the feudal salt trade. The shafts reach to more than 320 metres underground (the tourist route takes you to about 135 metres). Here you will find a cathedral etched into the salt and stone. With underground lakes, narrow corridors and guides who aren’t afraid to let you know how deep beneath the Earth’s surface you are, this amazing place isn’t for the fainthearted.JoeImages from prehistory in MoroccoAlong a bumpy road, behind the little village of Aït Ouazik, near Tazzarine, more than 300 prehistoric petroglyphs of elephants, rhino, giraffe, ostrich and more are carved into rocks atop a cliff-ringed hilltop. The exquisite depictions are impressive enough, and although the intent of the artists must be left to your imagination, you will leave with a sense of connection to the past and a people who gathered here 5,000 years ago, exchanging stories and recording the wonders they had encountered.George JoyPontcysyllte Aqueduct, ‘the river that runs in the sky’View image in fullscreenPontcysyllte Aqueduct and the River Dee.Photograph: Alasdair James/Getty ImagesThomas Telford’sPontcysyllte Aqueductis the centrepiece of a world heritage site that crosses three counties and two countries. There is a magic to standing halfway across “the river that runs in the sky”, looking down on the tumbling River Dee and Horseshoe Falls reservoir, the water Telford drew for his impossible canal project. Rather than a chain of locks cut across the valley, his iron trough spans it, joints sealed with red Welsh flannel dipped in boiling sugar. Opened in 1805, it is the highest, longest aqueduct in Britain.Fiona CollinsPitch amid the pines of Parnassus, GreeceView image in fullscreenSunset over Delphi.Photograph: Tomas Marek/AlamyArrive atDelphi Campingat night and pitch your tent under a sky the colour of dark wine among the pines of Mount Parnassus, haunt of the gods. The Kanatas family serve pine-scented retsina wine and slabs of creamy goat’s cheese, generously doused in oil harvested from their ancient olive groves. Awake at dawn and wander a dusty mountainside path to the archaeological sites, catching a glimpse of the temples through the trees. Return for an early dip in the campsite pool, perched above the Gulf of Corinth, 300 metres below.EmmaUzbekistan’s magical minaretView image in fullscreenThe Kalyan Minaret and mosque courtyard.Photograph: VW Pics/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesStanding proud in the heart of thesilk roadscity of Bukhara, the Kalyan Minaret exudes power and mystery in equal measure. Its beauty lies in the ornate brickwork arches and intricate geometric patterns that adorn its gently tapering body. So striking was this minaret that it was the only structure left unmolested by the Mongol warlord Genghis Khan, who reportedly could not bear to see it destroyed with the rest of the city. At night it is lit up and acts as a beacon, drawing locals and travellers alike to bask in its presence.Carl Sucharyna ThomasACTIVE BREAKSLocal flavour on a trek in the Italian AlpsView image in fullscreenThe Guglielmo Migliorero Refugem, a key stopover on the Grande Traversata delle Alpi.Photograph: Fabrizio Robba/AlamyWe completed three weeks of theGrande Traversata delle Alpi, a 500-mile trek in the Italian Alps. It was conceived as an economic regeneration project in the 1970s to join up and provide tourism to tiny villages with ageing populations and declining industry. In each location, one or more providers elects to supply accommodation and food to hikers; as a result the variety in our stays was immense. It cost €60-70pp pn half-board, sometimes less in dormitories. It’s a very quiet trail compared with many in the Alps, and we often had it to ourselves. Villagers are friendly and we enjoyed delicious local food, always at least three courses, with vegetarians fully catered for.Samantha McGradySailing on the Norfolk BroadsView image in fullscreenSailing boat from Hunter’s Yard.Photograph: Anglia Images/AlamyHunter’s Yardin Ludham looks after a fleet of 1930s cabin yachts and day boats, some now with electric motors. Beautifully maintained and easy to sail, they provide a restful, beautiful holiday. Away from the popular spots, the Norfolk Broads remain wild and full of birds and animals. Go to your bunk early, with the sound of water, ducks and rigging. Get up early and sail past the sleeping gin palaces. Moor up early near a pub for your evening drinks. Hunter’s Yard staff are friendly and happy to advise; I’ll never forget the smell of wood and varnish in their workshops.RupertScaling the heights in a hidden Asturias valleyView image in fullscreenPeña Ubiña in the Cantabrian Mountains.Photograph: Westend61/AlamyTheMeicín hostelin Asturias, on the border with the ancient kingdom of León, is surrounded by jagged mountains, wild ponies and, if you’re lucky, bears. Climb Picos del Fontán (2,414 metres) and you’ll be unlikely to encounter any other hikers as you walk through a hidden valley and year-round snowfields. Peña Ubiña, after which the national park is named, has views south to the Castilian plains, and north to the far busier Picos de Europa. The hostel offers full board in dorms, and you can hike or taxi to it from the high-speed station, Pola de Lena, which connects with Gijón on the Asturian coast.Robert GrahamHorse riding in the Welsh bordersView image in fullscreenHorse riding in Clyro, Powys.Photograph: PRWe return toFreerein Riding Holidaysin Clyro (Cleirwy), Powys, every year.

You can spend days relaxing in the surrounding hills and lavender fields, or take advantage of the mountain biking, horse riding and paragliding on offer near the site. When you fancy a bit more life, take a trip down to one of the restaurants in Moustiers-Sainte-Marie, a beautiful village that sits beneath limestone cliffs and is famous for its pottery. For the more adventurous, Verdon is the birthplace of sport climbing, or you can stay closer to the ground on a day trip canoeing down the gorge.LucyHiking and hospitality in AlbaniaView image in fullscreenA ferry on Lake Koman.Photograph: Hugh Mitton/AlamyMy partner and I had a magical time in the northern Albanian mountains. From Shkodër, we made our way to theValbona valley national parkvia a two-night stay on (and boat across) Lake Koman. Once in Valbona, we embarked on a series of spectacular hikes, including a three-day circular toÇerem. The first two days we saw no one apart from shepherds – and a few vipers. The views were breathtaking, the hospitality welcoming, and the experience incomparable.AlexRunning wild in Argyll and ButeView image in fullscreenBeach running in Argyll.We had an unforgettable experience at regenerativeAuchgoyle Farmon Scotland’s west coast. The running trails were adventurous and exciting, leading us through ancient woodland, across beaches and over hills.The wildlife and landscape were further brought to life by hosts Katharine and David’s infectious passion for – and knowledge of – their local environment. Between runs, we were rejuvenated with delicious home-cooked meals in the stunning farmhouse, and activities including yoga, wild swimming, a wood-fired sauna, art class and coffee tasting. We left feeling inspired, recharged and nourished by nature.KateTwinkling lights in Poland’s Tatra mountainsView image in fullscreenThe Snowlandia ice labyrinth in Zakopane, PolandZakopaneis a great base for skiers and anyone who enjoys winter mountain activities. It’s affordable (my chalet was just €400 for the week) and has lovely traditional wooden and stone houses, cafes and cheap restaurants serving tasty Polish stews andpierogis(filled dumplings), which kept us warm throughout. We hired snow shoes to explore the foothills by day, and at dusk the twinkling lights of the mountain villages came on, adding to the wonderful scene of lakes, mountains and forests. We also enjoyed sleigh rides and husky-driven carriages through the silent forests to magicalSnowlandia ice maze(open mid-January to mid-March).YasminGuardian Travel runs aweekly readers’ tips competition.

But this one of me and my brother is a reminder we still have each otherAmmar KaliaSat 10 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareMy only sibling is seven years older than me. That means he has forever been seven years ahead of me in life, sitting somewhere between a willing co-conspirator and knowledgable surrogate parent – protective but fun, and always aware of the secrets of existence I am yet to discover. It was his aside that spoiled the secret identity of Santa Claus; he who laughingly revealed the mechanics of sex; he who gave me my first sip of beer. Yet, when he found out I was sneaking cigarettes from my dad’s stale dinner party supply, he chastised me before either of my parents could, and when my mum was diagnosed with cancer and I was just 15, he was already a 22-year-old medical student, able to speak in a doctor’s shorthand and advocate for her care while my father and I floundered.Ever since my mum died in 2013, family photos have been a source of bittersweet pain. In the pictures where she is present, I’m reminded of her wide smile, appetite for fun and her loving presence. In the images without her, all I see is her absence – the mum-shaped silhouette where she should be, either because she was outside the frame or because she was no longer alive.There are some family photos, though, that escape that binary. One that sits on my desk and that I look at almost every day is of me and my brother, probably aged six and 13. We are perched on the lurid bedspread of my grandparents’ spare room in Hounslow, smiling from either side of a bootleg calendar image of supermodel Cindy Crawford. It’s as 90s and absurd as it sounds – I have no recollection of the calendar or why we had a picture taken with it and it doesn’t particularly look like I knew what was going on then either. But sense-making isn’t the point of the photo.Instead, the joy of the picture is in its snapshot of our goofy sibling bond. I’m sure my brother was in on some pre-pubescent secret as to the special status of the calendar, but, like so many younger siblings, I just seem happy to be included. The picture serves as a reminder of the world we would go on to create for ourselves – the hours spent passing each other the video game controller, watching late-night TV or cruising in my brother’s Fiat while blasting UK garage tunes. It’s not sad that my mum wasn’t present at any of those moments or in this picture, since this was a space for just us. And now that she is no longer here, it’s a reminder that we still have each other.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleMy favourite family photoFamilyPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They knew the fellow hunter who was messaging Dixon’s father, but what he wrote didn’t make sense.“He said: ‘Lake Rouge is gone,’” Dixon said.Lake Rouge was a calm lake nearby with trout, sandy banks and a surface area of about 3 sq km. By “gone”, they weren’t sure what the man was getting at.Dixon and his parents got their first glimpse as they walked up a logging road the next day. All the water of Lake Rouge had, in fact, vanished. Eagles and crows soon began to circle over the mud and dead fish that remained.He said his father “was quiet” when he first saw it, but then started narrating a rush of memories – the lake’s “really clear water”, and how moose gravitated there.A massive mud plain cutting north-east made it clear where the water had gone. It had travelled almost 10km overland into a bigger lake. Amazingly, no one had been hurt in this gigantic – was it a mudslide? A flood? Nobody was sure what to call it.Map“I was devastated,” said Chief Irene Neeposh of Waswanipi, an Indigenous Cree community. She called an emergency meeting, though she wasn’t sure who to invite.“Call me if you have a lake that drains, right?” she said. “Nobody knows what to do in this type of situation.”There is a name for this kind of sudden drainage of a lake – an outburst flood – but in recorded history these have usually happened at glacial lakes, when the underlying ice cracks, or at manmade reservoirs when the dam fails.Half a dozen international experts in the field told the Guardian they had never heard before of an outburst flood from a natural, non-glacial lake. Lake Rouge did not even empty through its normal drainage paths but cut a new outflow spot, an “absolutely amazing” case to see, said Diana Vieira, a scientist at the Joint Research Centre at the European Commission.The tougher question is: was this a freak natural event? Or was it human-caused? It can be impossible to untangle this mystery for a single extraordinary event, experts say, but the detective work is still important as they try to anticipate other surreal mass movements of water around the world.Natural geology was key to Lake Rouge’s demise. The lake was elevated and its banks were relatively soft with a pre-existing weak spot. The year’s snowfall and speed of spring melt were also reportedly both high. But some scientists and Cree elders say you must zoom out on the whole region’s history to really study the flood.Lac Rouge slider imageTwo rounds of wildfire torched Quebec forests in the last six years, including the mammoth 2023 fire that ate through a square mileage the size of mainland Denmark.“Unfortunately, these two successive major fires removed most of the mature vegetation cover [around] inflowing lakes and rivers directly leading to Lake Rouge,” concluded a report by the Quebec Cree forestry department. The spot where the shoreline broke was also burned.But in the even bigger picture, northern Quebec, including the Waswanipi region, has been heavily logged for decades. Logging companies are also often invited after wildfires to salvage wood at a discount.“You know, there’s about 6ft, 7ft of snow” in the area’s typical winter, said Paul Dixon, a 68-year-old distant cousin to Manoel Dixon.“When the forests were there, it would take three months to melt” under the shade, he said. “Now, you have the same amount of snow that melts in one month. That’s like putting a block of ice in a microwave oven.”Lake Rouge’s muddy banks have gradually “weakened because there’s no cover”, said local elder and forestry expert Allan Saganash.All soil can withstand pressure from the water it holds, up to a point, experts said.A coniferous forest normally absorbs about half the rain or snowfall in various ways. Without it, the excess reaches the groundwater, which feeds lakes and rivers and can oversaturate their banks.“Any disturbance on the land – wildfire, clearcut, logging, whatever … causes the groundwater table to move up to higher elevation” more often and for longer, said Younes Alila, a University of British Columbia hydrologist. “Instead of just one day, maybe several days. Instead of one week, maybe a couple of weeks.”Each time, the soaked soil loses strength, he said. “The soil starts to break. But where [is it] going to break first? On the banks of lakes and the banks of rivers.”On top of this, wildfire can make soil water-repellent for a few years, increasing runoff. And logging companies often “scarify” the ground after they log, essentially breaking up roots and dirt for replanting. This happened in one corner of Lake Rouge’s catchment area.“It feels like you’re in … fields of corn,” said Nicolas Mainville, a biologist at Snap Quebec, an environmental nonprofit, who visited Lake Rouge after it drained. “But it used to be a forest.”The Quebec government concluded Lake Rouge’s disappearance was natural and has not studied it. It also said that according to a study its forestry department commissioned in 2004, if half or less of the forest in a given watershed is disturbed by logging or wildfire, there will be only a “negligible” chance that waterways will be altered by high peak flows.View image in fullscreenTwo Waswanipi residents in Lake Rouge after it suddenly drained.Photograph: Chief Irene NeeposhAs scientists began to chatter about Lake Rouge, a single similar case came to light. A small lake 200km awayhad drained in under three hours in 1974. A sandy esker lay between that lake and a bigger one, and a fisher had dragged his boot through the sand, not expecting the whole lake to flow out.If lakes were going to suddenly vanish,Canadawould be the place, said François-Nicolas Robinne, a forest hydrologist for the province of Alberta. “It’s a very young landscape that’s evolving very fast,” he said, meaning it was covered by glaciers until only about 15,000 years ago.On Lake Rouge, drainage was probably imminent, maybe next year or “a century from now”, Robinne said. Logging and fire could have sped it up.Others have different takes on those odds. Alila said he was seeing a new pattern in changes along rivers and lakes in areas that have similarly lost tree cover.In western Canada, for example, the downtown of Quesnel – located on the banks of the Fraser River, and in a heavily logged, wildfire-beset region – has for almost 30 years been sliding several centimetres toward the river with every major spring thaw, Alila said. The town links the annual movement to increased groundwater.About 100km downstream, a landslide in August 2024 on the banks of the Chilcotin River released so much debris that it created a natural dam, backing up water into an 11km-long impromptu lake.“The government went through panic mode,” said Alila, fearing the dam’s burst. But scientists disagree in this case, too, on whether this landslide was caused more by geology or fire.It has long been known that wildfire can transform rivers. A decade after a 1988 wildfire at Yellowstone national park, researchers showed that more severely burned streams and rivers had become faster and deeper than others.Debris flows, another well-known post-wildfire risk, happen when heavy rain picks up sediment from a burned hillside, like the 2018 debris flow in Montecito, California, that killed 23. These may involve masses of water, but their flow cannot be predicted like water, said geomorphologist Luke McGuire of the University of Arizona.“One of my students once described it as like a milkshake,” he said.The shape-shifting of burned lakes has been less studied. In theorising that Lake Rouge’s disappearance was human-influenced, Alila said two clues seem key to him.One is timing. The lake vanished in spring, after the major thaw – one hint that the soil was exhausted from repeated soaking, he said. By contrast, the lake that drained in 1974 did so in early fall.The other clue is what is happening nearby. Across Quebec Cree territory, increasingly, “the banks of a river will collapse along the sides”, said Saganash. Mudslides on local hills have become commonplace, said Paul Dixon.He had not cried since childhood, but seeing Lake Rouge drained “the first time, I cried”, he said.At almost 70, he suddenly had a scary sense that anything could happen. Chief Neeposh said she urgently wants to notify people of the risk they face, but has no idea what to tell them.“I need to find out if there’s other potential lakes that could do this,” she said.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasGeologyRiversQuebecClimate crisisFloodingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The roads connecting Caracas to its western border are policed with dozens of military and police checkpoints.State department officials made a visit to Caracas on Friday as part of what are believed to be preparations for the re-opening of the US embassy there.

He claimed his government was “in charge” ofVenezuelaand that US companies were poised to extract the country’s oil wealth.Clearly giddy with the success of the operation, achieved without a single US fatality but several Venezuelan and Cuban ones, Trump then served notice on a string of other nations that could face the same fate. “Cuba is ready to fall,” he said. Colombia was run by a “sick man” who was selling cocaine to the US but who would not “be doing it for very long”.View image in fullscreenTrump speaking to reporters on Air Force One the day after the seizure of Nicolás Maduro.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersTrump said he would postpone for 20 days to two months any discussions about his desired takeover of Greenland, the semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, a Nato ally, but made clear he was determined to seize it for the sake of US “national security”.New imperialismLest there was any doubt about the scale of Trump’s territorial ambitions, his administration posted its message to the world in capital letters, some of them red, on social media.“This is OUR hemisphere,” thestate department declaredon X above a black and white picture of Trump looking grimly determined.The White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, went on CNN to provide the rationale for Trump’s new approach to foreign policy.“We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time,” he said.Miller is one of the few aides to have served in high positions in both the first and second Trump tenures. He has emerged as chief ideologue, channelling the impulses of the president and packaging them as policy. In a social media post on Monday, Miller addressed the bigger picture and argued it was time for the west to stop apologising for its imperialist past.“Not long after World War II the West dissolved its empires and colonies and began sending colossal sums of taxpayer-funded aid to these former territories (despite have [sic] already made them far wealthier and more successful),”Miller wrote.“The neoliberal experiment, at its core, has been a long self-punishment of the places and peoples that built the modern world.”The US has invaded a long list of countries and changed regimes many times over the past few decades, but this is the first time it has done so since the second world war as a self-proclaimed exercise in imperialism. The extraordinary change in rhetoric coming from Washington means all three of the world’s military superpowers are overtly pursuing revanchist aims, the recovery of lost imperial greatness.View image in fullscreenSan Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, which is one of five territories under US sovereignty.Photograph: trekandshoot/AlamyVladimir Putin has taken on the mantle of Peter and Catherine the Great in restoring historical Russian lands, at the cost so far of a million Russian troops killed or injured in Ukraine, according to the British Ministry of Defence, the culmination of a string of conquests in Chechnya and Georgia.Xi Jinping has dedicated himself to China’s “great rejuvenation”, which includes recovering the territorial expanse of the Qing empire at its high-water mark before the “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign powers from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Beijing’s projection of force withmilitary bases around the South China Seadraws from that rationale, but Xi has repeatedly made clear the mission will not be completed until Taiwan is back under Beijing’s rule.Like the other two ageing autocrats, Trump’s vision for his country harks back to a bygone imperial past. His favourite president isWilliam McKinley, who led the US through a surge of territorial expansion at the end of the 19th century, including the military takeover of Cuba and the annexation of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines and American Samoa.Trump has also looked to the early 19th century for inspiration for his new bout of territorial acquisitiveness, in the form of the Monroe doctrine.View image in fullscreenJames Monroe, the fifth US president.Photograph: Getty Images“It was very important, but we forgot about it. We don’t forget about it any more,” the president said on Saturday.The reference not only reflected a view of the past uncomplicated by any detailed reading on Trump’s part, but also the changing relationship between the US and the notion of empire.The country was founded as a rejection of British imperialism and when President James Monroe developed his doctrine in 1823, setting out the leading US role in theAmericas, it was to act as a barrier to any further European colonialism.The version of the doctrine that Trump appears to embrace, however, is its repurposing by Teddy Roosevelt in 1904 at the height of a US exercise in traditional imperialism. Under the “Roosevelt corollary”, the US took on the role of “police power” which would intervene in any country in the region where it perceived there to be “flagrant cases of wrongdoing or impotence”.In itsnational security strategy documentpublished in November, a blueprint for the expansionism of early 2026, the White House laid out a “Trump corollary” to the Monroe doctrine “to restore American pre-eminence in the western hemisphere”.Trump calls it the “Donroe doctrine”, copying a New York Post front page from a year earlier. The difference from previous versions, he boasted characteristically, was that it would be bigger and better.The original Monroe doctrine was “a big deal”, he said, but added: “We’ve superseded it by a lot, by a real lot.”For all the febrile talk of doctrine and the sharp swerve in rhetoric coming from the White House, it is far from clear how it intends to proceed in Venezuela.New president, old policy?There appears to be disagreement within the administration – to the extent there is detailed discussion at all – on how to turn the president’s self-image of hemispheric emperor into a plan of action. Until that happens, what Trump has done in Venezuela is arguably not out of line with what the US has done around the world, but particularly in the Americas, when it was supposed to be abiding by the post-1945 “rules-based order”.Some argue that, as seen from the global south, US imperialism has remained a constant, and that all Trump has done is to drop the mask of hypocrisy.“The idea that this is new is ridiculous,” said Kehinde Andrews, a professor of black studies at Birmingham City University in the UK and the author of The New Age of Empire: How Racism and Colonialism Still Rule the World. “The US has been doing this all along, but the only difference here is it’s just brazen. There’s nothing new about this at all. This is what the west does; Trump’s just honest about it. I actually find it refreshing to be honest.”Andrews added that if Trump carried out his threat to seize Greenland, directing his imperialist appetites towards another western state and thereby crippling Nato, it would mark a significant break with the past. But for that same reason, he doubted it would happen.“If it was a black or brown place, it would have happened already,” Andrews said.View image in fullscreenHouses on the coast of a sea inlet in Nuuk, Greenland.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APDaniel Immerwahr, a historian and humanities professor at Northwestern University in Illinois, and the author of How to Hide an Empire, agreed that “the US empire never really ended”.He pointed out that the US still owns five permanently inhabited territories – Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa – and maintains 750 military bases around the world.On the other hand, Immerwahr argued that, for all the US hypocrisy and double standards under the “rule-based international order”, it remained markedly different to the imperial era.“The notion that as the US got more powerful it would grow larger – that was largely broken by the end of world war two,” Immerwahr said. While the liberal international order did not stop invasions and wars, “it is also true that the post-1945 era has seen far more decolonisation than imperial expansion, in terms of territory. And that has helped bring down war deaths enormously”, he said.The left has historically condemned the post-1945 global order because it baked in western advantage, but the more extreme elements of the right have despised it because it involved surrendering colonial assets, and helping old adversaries recover from the war.Trump spent much of his career as a property developer railing against Japanese competition, an antipathy he has since broadened to China. Much of his rhetoric over Venezuela and other would-be imperial targets revolves around reclaiming assets, such as oil industry infrastructure, that had been “stolen” from the US. So in Trump’s view, making America truly great again inevitably demands a return to expansion. Putin and Xi are bent on making Russia and China great again, for similar motives.Potential clash of empiresThe US seizure this week of an oil tanker,the Marinera, despite the fact it was Russian flagged and escorted by a Russian submarine, brought into urgent focus the question of whether, and for how long, the ambitions of the three superpowers can be reconciled without major conflict.“There can be really rather a protracted period of time in which empires can coexist,” Nathalie Tocci, the director of Italy’s Institute of International Affairs, said. “It’s not as if Trump is saying: I want to be the only empire; Trump is basically signalling and acting as if he’s absolutely fine with Russia and China being empires.“In the short to medium term, I would say that the greater risk is not the empires clashing with one another, but the subjugation of the colonies,” she said.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin and Xi Jinping attending a military parade in Beijing last year.Photograph: Rao Aimin/APPutin and Xi would certainly be content with a world sliced into spheres of influence. During the firstTrump administration, Russia informally floated the idea that the US could have a free hand in Venezuela in exchange for Russia holding sway over Ukraine in its sphere of influence.Fiona Hill, who at the time was serving in the Trump White House as the national security council director for Russian and European affairs, said: “The Russians were trying it on. It was all vague and a matter of hint-hint, wink-wink, saying: ‘Let’s talk about the Monroe doctrine,’ and then giving a meaningful look.”Hill said the first Trump administration rejected the suggestion of any such deal, but she acknowledged that the president’s views on empire had clearly evolved.“I remember actually telling people before that he was a real estate mogul. He didn’t want to own your country, just put up his buildings on it,” she said. “But I suppose it’s a quick jump for him from real estate to state acquisition, and that’s what we weren’t anticipating before.”Hill is not confident that the three great revanchist empires can stay out of each other’s way. In his newly whetted appetite for US expansionism, Trump has reserved the right to act far beyond his hemisphere, bombing Iran or even running Gaza.“He’s saying: ‘Hands off and keep away from the western hemisphere’, but he’s not necessarily going to leave China unchecked in the Asia-Pacific,” Hill said. “The US is still supposed to be an Asian-Pacific power, and part of the western hemisphere is in the Pacific.“This world is much more complex now,” she added. “It’s all very fragile, especially because we don’t know what mistakes he’s going to make.”Domestic considerationsTrump’s imperial impulses may be constrained, to some extent, byUS politics. Post-Venezuela polling suggested that large majorities, among Democrats and Republicans alike, were opposed to any long-term involvement in the country.However, Trump’s Maga base was thrilled by the success of the operation, and his long-sagging popularity gained a minor bump. For a president seeking to distract from an intractable affordability crisis at home and the looming threat of more child-trafficking revelations in the Epstein files, that may be enough to seek out other quick military spectacles abroad.With the guardrails of the old order demolished, Trump’s US would be an ever more chaotic factor in the world, not coherent enough to be called an empire but imperial in the imposition of suffering by the strong on the weak.Writing in Mother Jonesthis week, the magazine’s Washington editor, David Corn, suggested that is the essence of the real Trump doctrine: “Violence is ours to use, at home and abroad, to get what we want.”View image in fullscreenA military officer comforts Ramona Palma, the mother of the Venezuelan soldier Cesar Garcia, who was killed in the US raid, after his wake in Caracas.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/APWhat was the Monroedoctrine?The Trump administration has revived the 203-year-old Monroe doctrine, and made it the cornerstone of its newly aggressive policy in the Americas.TheUS national security strategy(NSS) published in November, stated that: “After years of neglect, the United States will reassert and enforce the Monroe doctrine to restore American pre-eminence in the western hemisphere.”Trump himself has bandied the term about, characteristically adapting it to the “Donroe doctrine”, a play on his first name to emphasise his ownership of the idea.The original doctrine, put forward by President James Monroe in 1823, meant something quite different. He proposed that the recently established United States act as a guarantor against European imperialism in the region, declaring the nations of the American continents were “not to be considered as subjects for future colonisation by any European powers”.In 1904, however, the doctrine was updated by President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt to suit the enthusiasm for US colonialism at the time, in the aftermath of the Spanish-American war. The “Roosevelt corollary” bestowed “international police power” on Washington to intervene anywhere in the Americas where it perceived there to be “chronic wrongdoing” by a sovereign government.The NSS declares a new “Trump corollary” to the doctrine, marking a return to colonial appetites, and the president’s focus on natural resources. It states no outside power has the right to “own or control strategically vital assets”."

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Indonesia, with the world’s biggest Muslim population, has strict rules that ban the sharing online of content deemed obscene.Indonesia’s block follows Grok switching off its image creation function on Friday for the vast majority of users after the widespread outcry about its use to create sexually explicit and violent imagery.Musk has also been threatened with fines, regulatory action and reports of a possibleban on X in the UK.The tool has also been used to manipulate images of women to remove their clothes and put them in sexualised positions. The function to do so has been switched off except for paying subscribers.Elon Musk’s X threatened with UK ban over wave of indecent AI imagesRead moreAustralian prime minister Anthony Albanese has also expressed concern over the use of artificial intelligence on the Grok chatbot to enable exploitative sexual content.The prime minister on Saturday joined a growing list of international leaders including British counterpart Keir Starmer in criticising the social media platform.“The use of generative AI to exploit or sexualise people without their consent is abhorrent,” he told reporters in Canberra.“The fact that this tool was used so that people were using its image creation function through Grok is, I think, just completely abhorrent.“It, once again, is an example of social media not showing social responsibility and Australians and indeed, global citizens deserve better.”While the number of reports received by Australia’s eSafety Office remains small, it says there has been a recent increase relating to the use of Grok to create sexualised or exploitative imagery.The watchdog warned on Friday it would use its powers including removal notices where such material meets the thresholds defined in the Online Safety Act.“X, Grok and a wide range of other services are also subject to systemic safety obligations to detect and remove child sexual exploitation material and other unlawful material as part of Australia’s world-leadingindustry codes and standards,” it said.With Reuters and AAPExplore more on these topicsIndonesiaXAsia PacificElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

You don’t want to expand it so much that you’re bringing in a whole bunch of new companies without much bang for buck in terms of emissions,” he said.“It’s not a sort of slam dunk to say, well, obviously, covering a lot more businesses is the obvious thing to do.”Explore more on these topicsCop31Climate crisisAustralian politicsTurkeySaudi ArabiaChris BowennewsShareReuse this content"

There is no detail about the identity of the related parties.These payments “virtually eliminate profits” for the company, according to Ward, resulting in no tax payable.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAt the same time, payments for directors and key management personnel increased during the 12-month period, the documents show, even after it reported a financial loss.There is no suggestion the company or its directors have acted illegally.Telco Services is one of the operational arms of a Perth-based entity known as TSA Group, run out of Perth. The group says it has a team of more than 4,300 workers operating in five contact centres across Australia and the Philippines.Along with its government agency contract, the group runs outsource operations for major corporations and brands, including Telstra and NRMA insurance.‘It feels as if I’m working for the ATO – except for the pay’: test case could put brakes on tax office outsourcingRead moreA TSA group spokesperson said while the Telco Services company did not record taxable income, “other associated entities did and the appropriate amount of tax has been paid by them”.“The taxation arrangements and payments have been assessed by a large, independent auditor,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson said the entities which paid the tax were not required to meet public reporting requirements and that Telco Services had paid tax in prior years.TSA described the related party transactions as costs incurred for services provided by associated companies, which are “simultaneously booked as revenue by the associated companies”.An analysis of the TSA group’s structure by Guardian Australia found that its various businesses rarely lodge public financial accounts, which is unusual for such a large operator with thousands of employees and large revenue streams.The complex structure made it impossible to publicly verify how much overall tax it has paid, or how related party transactions flowed between different entities.Another of its operational arms, called Telco Sales, holds a flagship contract with Telstra. This company paid just over $700,000 in corporate tax in 2022-23 but received a partial refund the following year. It generated more than $120m in revenue over the two tax years.While the Telco Services arm of the TSA group holds the Services Australia outsource contract, the staff are employed by a different entity called Trimatic Management Services.Trimaticreceived $5m in grant fundingfrom the Western Australian government in 2024 to expand call centre jobs in the state.A spokesperson for Services Australia said the agency hosts one of the largest contact centre networks in the country and that its workforce is “built on a base of mostly permanent Australian public service staff” supplemented by contractors.Centrelink also uses a separate outsource operator, Concentrix, to run some of its call centre operations.Guardian Australia has detailed how heavily government agencies now rely on outsource call centres and howattempts to curb reliance on external consultants and contract workers have stalled.The majority of calls to the Australian Taxation Office’s phone line are answered by workers at three private operators, the US private equity-owned Probe Operations, British multinational Serco and Concentrix.Tax agents have complained to the ombudsman of adeteriorating service on the ATO phone lines, saying they often speak to inexperienced call staff who cannot provide informed responses.Do you know more?

All around the house, right up to the brick perimeter, the bushes and trees he planted are still smoking. The sheds are buckled, their contents reduced to toxic rubble.The family were lucky – their nextdoor neighbour’s house is burned to the ground. That’s the story all down this road that leads into the small town: miracles bookended by disaster.Victoria’s emergency management commissioner, Tim Wiebusch,told the media on Saturdayabout 50 homes had been lost in the Ravenswood and Harcourt fire, which was believed to be a “conservative number”.0:29Firefighters battle bushfire in regional Victoria, where 50 structures were destroyed – videoAccess to Harcourt was blocked by police on Saturday, but that didn’t stop a steady stream of onlookers in cars – whole families, sometimes – who managed to evade the roadblocks before being turned away by frustrated members of the CFA.“We evacuated just as the fire jumped the highway,” Suelzle says, surveying the blackened skeleton of his mother’s mobility scooter. “I left work at about 3.30 [on Friday afternoon], came home, then the wind changed. I saw all the ash coming and it went black. I loaded the dogs and the cat and took off. We went to our daughter’s place in Bendigo. We were lucky. The other end of town was hit even worse.”The fire, which started near Fogarty’s Gap Road on Friday afternoon, jumped the Calder Freeway and burned through Harcourt and over Mount Alexander, taking out essential telecommunications, water, sewage and rail infrastructure, including the broadcasting capacity for ABC local radio – which broadcasts emergency alerts.Homes in Harcourt, Castlemaine and surrounding areas lost power and internet, as well as water pressure. The Suelzles were able to access commercial radio for updates.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA little way up the road, Chris and Augustine Sheppard sit outside their burned-out investment block. The house where they live, on a different block, is safe.“I couldn’t find the cat yesterday so I got the dogs, let the chooks out and left for Castlemaine,” Augustine says. “We obviously didn’t sleep last night and as soon as we got up we came back to see if we could get in.”They haven’t yet been able to get hold of their immediate neighbours whose houses have been destroyed.View image in fullscreenBrian ‘Buzz’ Nunn at the pub on Saturday after fighting the bushfires in Harcourt.Photograph: Jenny Valentish/The GuardianLocal man Brian “Buzz” Nunn stayed in town to protect the kindergarten.Safely united with a schooner on Saturday, Nunn describes fighting the fires for five hours on Friday, even as his family relentlessly called his phone to check on his whereabouts.Nunn says he saw the fire approach over a hill and tried to put it out with his bobcat tracks. Unable to contain it, he jumped into his ute, left the keys in the ignition and decided to join his neighbour Pam in protecting the houses with water from her tank.“When [Harcourt] Pine Centre burned down it knocked over a fire hydrant so we had to use the watering cans and bins that Pam was handing over her fence.”That worked for a while, but then the fire started licking up the stormwater downpipe of the kindergarten and also ignited the walkway.“I raced out there, going back and forth to the neighbour’s, but I ran out of water and I was getting buggered. Next minute, Redesdale Fire Brigade turned up and got it under control.”‘We’re not out of danger’As the devastating bushfire ripped through Mount Alexander, Prue Walduck and Ada Milley took it in turns keeping watch overnight.While others evacuated, they stayed on their Harcourt North property to defend their home – and their alpacas.“I’ve got females due to birth. The first one’s due in three days,” Walduck says.View image in fullscreenPrue Walduck and Ada Milley of Millduck Alpaca Stud took it in turns keeping watch overnight on their home and alpacas.Photograph: Prue Walduck/Ada MilleyWalduck says being in the dark and unable to see the surrounding landscape made it harder to tell if the fire was heading for them.“Sitting on the lawn at two o’clock in the morning, it was quite calm, the wind had dropped, but there was no frame of reference to know where it actually was,” she says.“There was a predicted wind change that would have turned it around straight back on us.“So we took it in two- and three-hour turns. If it had turned our way, we were the first ones in our little community so we were on guard for ourselves and for our neighbours – most of them have left, but five are still here.”View image in fullscreenColin Pickering of Blackwood Orchard has described the ‘scorched earth’ in the wake of the fire.Photograph: Frank MagreeThe couple have a straw bale house – which hardly sounds fireproof, but it is concrete rendered, making it relatively safe. They planned to herd the alpacas into a shearing shed with a concrete floor, and to move them out quickly if necessary.Now Walduck is starting to worry about running out of fodder.At Blackwood Orchard in Harcourt North, Colin Pickering describes the “scorched earth” in the wake of the fire, which has left him without power.“There are still a lot of sources of reignition, so we’re watching that,” he says.“But compared to a person who’s lost everything, I’ve got no hassles.”Walduck and Milley were planning another night-time vigil.“We’re not out of danger,” Walduck says. “Another wind change could bring it towards us.”View image in fullscreenHouses on Coolstore Road, Harcourt burned by the fire.Photograph: Frank MagreeView image in fullscreenInside damaged property at Harcourt.Photograph: Jenny Valentish100km/h windsAt a community meeting in Castlemaine Town Hall on Saturday afternoon, authorities were unable to say how many houses had been lost in Harcourt, but the majority of public buildings had been saved, including the primary school. The town’s much-loved miniature railway was damaged but intact, while the Coolstore Cafe was destroyed.The CFA incident controller for Ravenswood, Michael Masters, said the situation was still too dynamic to provide solid answers or to allow residents to return to their homes.The Mount Alexander mayor, Toby Heydon, said the local leadership had been working to coordinate the fire response, even as some staff and councillors lost their homes and properties.At a later meeting in Kyneton, Masters apologised to the Harcourt community.“Despite the best efforts of all the emergency responders we weren’t able to do what our main task was, and keep people safe, and I apologise for that,” Masters said.Masters said the fire “ran really quickly … under 100km/h plus winds” and firefighters were unable to get close enough to control the spread.As the fire crested Mount Alexander it sent spot fires 7km east. “That’s very significant fire behaviour,” Masters said.The Calder Freeway, which was closed on Friday afternoon, would be reopened Saturday evening, he said.The fire took out the water processing facility and sewage facility in Harcourt as well as powerlines, leaving the town without water, sewage and electricity. Masters said the loss of ABC local radio was alarming.“If it was just broadcasting the Test cricket it would not particularly bother me … but it’s our emergency broadcasting partner. So our ability to deliver advice and warnings to the community has been significantly impacted.”He said local radio Phoenix FM 106.7 was rebroadcasting ABC local radio.Also destroyed was a transmission line which provides back up power to the nearby larger town of Castlemaine, “so we have no redundancy”.Heydon said “the whole of the shire was effectively a red zone yesterday”.A recovery centre is due to open in Castlemaine from Monday morning.Explore more on these topicsBushfiresVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

The open discussion of ideas, beliefs, facts and opinion is ultimately the pathway to community cohesion. Silencing and censorship are not.”The letter also questioned why the board appeared to have abandoned its support for the director of Adelaide writers’ week, Louise Adler, who is scheduled to deliver her fourth festival from 28 February to 4 March.In 2023 Adlerdefended the inclusion of several Palestinian speakers, two of whom drew criticism for controversial comments made before the festival.On the opening night that yearMalinauskas saidhe had been under immense pressure to axe the funding for writers’ week, but decided it would set a dangerous precedent if a government determined who was allowed to speak.“What path does that take us down?” he said then. “It’s a path to a future where politicians decide what is culturally appropriate … a path, in fact, that leads us into the territory of Putin’s ­Russia.”Saturday’s letter said: “The festival board has previously been admirable in its support of the director’s decisions in the face of vocal and well-organised opposition … the board’s reversal of its principled support for the director and her program at this time is, in our view, antithetical to what the festival and writers’ week have and should stand for.”The festival board and Adler were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsPeter MalinauskasSouth AustraliaAdelaideFestivalsBondi beach terror attacknewsShareReuse this content"

The area is home to Unesco-listed ancient ruins and was once controlled by jihadist fighters.“The strikes today targeted ISIS throughout Syria” and were part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched “in direct response to the deadly ISIS attack on US and Syrian forces in Palmyra,” US Central Command said in a statement on X.The US and Jordan carried out a previous round of strikes as part of the same operation last month, hitting dozens of Islamic State group targets.View image in fullscreenAn image taken from video released by the US Central Command after US strikes against Islamic State in Syria.Photograph: US Central Command/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Palmyra attack was the first such incident since the overthrow of Syria’s longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.The US personnel who were targeted were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the international effort to combat IS, which seized swaths of Syrian and Iraqi territory in 2014.The jihadists were ultimately defeated by local ground forces backed by international airstrikes and other support, but IS still has a presence in Syria, especially in the country’s vast desert.The US president, Donald Trump, has long been sceptical of American troops being in Syria, ordering their withdrawal during his first term but ultimately leaving them in place.British and French aircraft attack underground Islamic State weapons store in SyriaRead moreThe Pentagon announced in April that the US would halve the number of personnel in Syria in the following months, while the US’s special envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, said in June that Washington would eventually reduce its bases in the country to one.Explore more on these topicsIslamic StateSyriaUS militaryMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They chanted: “Death to Khamenei,” in reference to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and: “Long live the shah.”New protests broke out late on Saturday with people rallying in a northern district of Tehran, according to a video verified by AFP.View image in fullscreenA mosque is set on fire during protests in Tehran, Iran, 10 January 2026.Photograph: Social Media/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockFireworks were set off over Tehran’s Punak Square as demonstrators banged pots and shouted slogans in support of the Pahlavi rulers ousted after the 1979 Islamic revolution, the video showed.Crowds of protesters also marched through the streets of Mashhad as fires burned around them, a show of defiance in the home town of Khamenei, who has condemned the protesters as “vandals” and blamed the US for fanning the flames of dissent.Iran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some timeRead moreMap of protests in IranDonald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Iranian authorities kill protesters, earning angry rebukes from Tehran. He said on Friday that the Iranian authorities were “in big trouble”, adding: “You better not start shooting, because we’ll start shooting too.”On Saturday night he said the US is “ready to help” as protesters inIranfaced an intensifying crackdown by authorities of the Islamic republic.“Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!” Trump said in a social post on Truth Social, without elaborating.Those authorities warned people to not take part in protests on Saturday. The country’s attorney general, Mohammad Mahvadi Azad, said anyone who did so would be considered an “enemy of god”, a charge which carries the death penalty. State TV later clarified that anyone who even assisted protesters could face the charge.Despite the crackdown, more protests were planned for the weekend. Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah of Iran, called for protesters to take to the streets on Saturday and Sunday and seize control of their towns. Pahlavi, who has emerged as an increasingly popular figure in the current round of protests, asked people to hoist the pre-1979 “lion and sun” flag that was used during his father’s rule.“Our goal is no longer merely to come into the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize city centres and hold them,” he said, promising he would return to Iran soon.The continuing block on the internet and mobile networks means it is hard for international media to estimate the size of the demonstrations, the largest in Iran in recent years, which pose a serious challenge to the regime’s rule.View image in fullscreenAyatollah Ali Khamenei, pictured on 9 January, has blamed the US for whipping up the protests.Photograph: Iranian Supreme Leader’s Office/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockBut the few videos coming out of the country, as well as activists who managed to evade the blackout via the Starlink satellite system, spoke of angry protesters and a heavy-handed police response.“We’re standing up for a revolution, but we need help. Snipers have been stationed behind the Tajrish Arg area [a wealthy neighbourhood in Tehran],” a protester in Tehran told the Guardian via sporadic text messages sent via Starlink. The protester said many people had been shot at across the city, adding: “We saw hundreds of bodies.”The Guardian was not able to independently verify the protesters’ claims and human rights activists have also said verification of reported human rights violations is difficult.However, another activist in Tehran told the Guardian they had witnessed security forces firing live ammunition at protesters and saw a “very high” number killed, while human rights activists said the claims of police brutality were consistent with testimony they had been given.The US-based Human Rights Activist news agency has said that at least 72 people had been killed in the violence surrounding the protests and more than 2,300 others detained. Rights groups and Iranian authorities have also documented casualties among security forces, which the latter blame on foreign-backed saboteurs.Map of protestsThe Iranian Nobel peace prize-winner Shirin Ebadi warned on Friday that security forces could be preparing to commit a “massacre under the cover of a sweeping communications blackout”, and said she had already received reports of hundreds of people being treated for eye injuries at a single Tehran hospital.Protesters were brought to the streets on 28 December by a deteriorating economy, but quickly began chanting anti-government slogans and demanding political reform.Though Iran has experienced mass protests before, analysts have said the battering of the regime during the 12-day war with Israel and the loss of Iranian-backed forces across the region have made it more vulnerable.Iranian authorities have become increasingly confrontational in their rhetoric towards protesters, casting them as being infiltrated and backed by Israeli, or US saboteurs. The Iranian army vowed in a statement on Saturday to foil “the enemy’s plots”, warning that undermining the country’s security was a “red line”.State TV tried to portray an air of normality as protests continued, describing them as small aberrations from an otherwise peaceful country. A state television anchor warned protesters not to go out, telling parents to stop their children from demonstrating. “If something happens, if someone is injured, if a bullet is fired and something happens to them, do not complain,” they said.The international community has rallied around the protesters, with EU states and the US posting messages of support. “The United States supports the brave people of Iran,” Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said on X on Saturday.Iranian authorities have tried a carrot-and-stick approach, distinguishing between what they called “legitimate” protesters expressing economic grievances and “rioters” backed by foreign powers trying to destablise Iran. The government has said it is engaging in dialogue with the former, but human rights groups have described increasing generalised violence directed at protesters at the hands of security officials.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Tehran on 9 January.Photograph: MAHSA/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty ImagesA video verified by Iran Human Rights group showed distressed family members looking through a pile of bodies in Ghadir hospital in Tehran on Thursday.

They implored media to continue covering the situation in Iran as they described worsening brutality.“Please make sure to state clearly that they are killing people with live ammunition,” an Iranian activist said.Explore more on these topicsIranRights and freedomMiddle East and north AfricaAyatollah Ali KhameneiDonald TrumpHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

International calls to the country appeared blocked and domestic mobile phones had no service, said Amir Rashidi, an Iranian digital rights expert.This is far from the first time a country has blocked the internet for political reasons. Egypt’s Hosni Mubarakblockedthe internet for six days during the 2011 Tahrir protests, and the Talibanshut downAfghanistan’s for 48 hours in September, ostensibly to curb “immorality”.New protests erupt in Iran as supreme leader signals upcoming crackdownRead moreBut the level of shutdown in Iran is unprecedented and in some ways far harsher than its 2019 digitalblackout, which internet observers described at the time as the most“severe disconnection”they had seen anywhere.“There is no reception on the phones. There is no antenna. It’s like you are living in the middle of nowhere, with no BTS towers,” said Rashidi.Even Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite system, which was alifelinefor Iranians during the 2022 protests over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody, was being jammed, Rashidi said, although the extent varied from one neighbourhood to another.While Iranians across the country were suddenly cut off from the internet, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, continued toposton X. He did so at least 12 times on Friday, inveighing against Donald Trump and US action in Venezuela.This is what makes this blackout different from previousinternetblockagesin Iran, said Doug Madory, an expert in internet infrastructure who studies such disruptions. It is more sweeping, but also appears to be more fine-tuned, which potentially means Tehran will be able to sustain it for longer.0:46Iran hit by internet blackout as protests over economic conditions continue – videoRashidi said: “There are things that are important for the government to do. If they want to put out their propaganda they need to have access to Telegram, they need to have access to Twitter, they need to access Instagram.”Alluding to Mubarak’s 2011 shutdown, Madory said there were “big costs to taking everything down”.“If you look at what happened in Egypt … the government couldn’t operate,” he said. “People really use the internet for a lot of things, and when they take it all down, nothing works.”‘In isolation, we’ll never flourish’: What Iranians think about the protests and an end to the Islamic RepublicRead moreBased on external evidence, Madory and Rashidi believe the Iranian government has whitelisted some sites, allowing some officials and institutions to continue to access the internet.Some of its Telegram channels appeared to be working, Rashidi said, indicating that its administrators must have internet service. The government appeared to soften the blackoutbrieflyfor university websites on Friday, then shut service down again.All of this suggests Iran has developed more precise tools for censoring the internet. “If they end up implementing a whitelist, and it works as planned it may enable them to operate in some kind of degraded state for an extended period of time,” said Madory.“What they’re doing is trying to set this up so that they don’t have to turn everything back on. They want just the bare necessities to be able to communicate and then shut everything else off.”Iran has been working to upgrade its ability to censor the internet for some years, said Rashidi and Madory, trying to build a internal service similar to China’s that connects domestic users while cutting them off from the outside world.It is not alone in trying to refine government control over the internet. India isbuildinga government-managed messaging app to rival WhatsApp, and Russia ispushinga state-backed “super app” similar to China’s WeChat.Iran’s national model may not yet be working, however, because sites linked to it are currently inaccessible, said Rashidi.National internet or no, however, Madory suspects the blackout may last some time. “This might be for the long haul,” he said. “I’ve been doing this for a while and I think it’s going to be a big one.”Explore more on these topicsIranInternetCensorshipMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Authorities look more vulnerable this time around because of the dire economic situation and the aftermath of last year’s conflict with Israel and the US.Trump, in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, suggested the supreme leader was preparing to flee Iran. “He’s looking to go somewhere. It’s getting very bad,” he said.On Friday night he warned Iran’s leaders that they “better not start shooting because we’ll start shooting too”.Graph showing Iran’s annual consumer price inflation rateThe head of Iran’s judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said consequences for demonstrators would be “decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency”.The leaders of France, Germany and the UK released a joint statement on Friday night urging Iran to exercise restraint.“We are deeply concerned about reports of violence by Iranian security forces and strongly condemn the killing of protesters,” they said. “The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal. We urge the Iranian authorities to exercise restraint, to refrain from violence and to uphold the fundamental rights of Iran’s citizens.”An internet blackout introduced on Thursday has sharply reduced the amount of information flowing out of the country. The Iranian rights group Hengaw reported that a protest march after Friday prayers in Zahedan, where the Baloch minority predominates, was met with gunfire that wounded several people.Amnesty International said the “blanket internet shutdown” aims to “hide the true extent of the grave human rights violations and crimes under international law they are carrying out to crush” the protests.The blackout has now been in place for 36 hours, monitor Netblocks said on Saturday.“After another night of protests met with repression, metrics show the nationwide internet blackout remains in place at 36 hours,” it said in a post on X.Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights, raising a previous toll of 45 issued the day earlier, said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, have been killed by security forces and hundreds more injured.Videos from the protests on Thursday showed crowds of thousands of people marching through the streets of Tehran, setting fire to a building belonging to the Iranian state broadcasters and hoisting a flag bearing the lion and sun emblem – the flag of Iran before the 1979 revolution that brought the current regime to power.View image in fullscreenAli Khamenei speaking in Qom yesterday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesReza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, who had called for the protests on Thursday night, made another call for demonstrations to take place at 8pm (1630 GMT) on Friday. He also called on Trump to help the protesters, saying Khamenei “wants to use this blackout to murder these young heroes”.Footage from Thursday showed protesters chanting in support of Pahlavi, including in Mashhad, Khamenei’s home town. Protesters who went out on Thursday night said they were met with violence – part of what rights groups are calling an already brutal crackdown.“They’re aiming for the eyes,” Maryam, a 25-year-old artist who was at protests in Tehran in the early hours of Friday, told the Guardian via text message. “The Faraja [uniformed police], the Basij [paramilitary militia] and even plainclothes kill squads are driving into the crowds with motorbikes. I don’t know how long the internet will be working but we are thousands on the streets and I fear I will wake up to hundreds of casualties.”Map of protests in TehranIranian state media acknowledged the protests for the first time on Friday, casting the unrest as violent riots instigated by “terrorist agents” of the US and Israel. State TV channels projected an air of normality, airing footage of pro-government demonstrations and saying life went on as usual for most Iranians.State media claimed Iran had caught agents from the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, who had infiltrated protest movements. The Iranian-owned Press TV reported that an Israeli spy cell was planning a “false-flag killing operation aimed at blaming the state for civilian deaths”.Speaking in Beirut on Friday, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, echoed claims of overseas interference. “The protests that are happening in Iran of course are different from protests in other countries because of US and Israeli interventions in the protests,” he said. “You need to look at all the statements from the US and Israel to see how they are interfering.”The United States on Friday said that Iran’s foreign minister was “delusional” after he accused Israel and Washington of fueling the protests that have swept the Islamic republic.“This statement reflects a delusional attempt to deflect from the massive challenges the Iranian regime faces at home,” a US state department spokesperson said.Authorities cut off internet access in Iran at about 8pm local time on Thursday, about the same time as Pahlavi’s call for protests. Understanding exactly what was happening in Iran and the true size of protests was difficult, with data and phone lines down. Human rights groups said documenting human rights violations was also hampered by the shutdown.View image in fullscreenPeople gather on the streets during a protest in Mashhad, in a screen grab obtained from a social media video on Thursday.Photograph: Social media/ReutersStudents at a university in Tehran said they were trying to find a way to avoid the internet shutdown, relying on methods they developed during the war with Israel in the summer when authorities also shut down access.Hossein, a 22-year-old university student, said: “Since June we have been trying several ways to find these ‘secret tunnels’ that can route our messages outside the country. A group of us are able to still chat but I can see mobile lines are also getting disrupted.”Demonstrators appeared to respond to Pahlavi’s call on Thursday, with anti-government chants ringing out at 8pm, as well as calls for the exiled crown prince to return.One protester, Mehnaz, said she believed Pahlavi could assist with a transition to democracy. “We failed to unify under a strong opposition last time [2022] but we have learned our lessons,” said the 46-year-old. “We have to rally for him because we are desperate to survive.”Elements of the protest movement, largely leaderless until now, have rallied around the figure, though it was unclear if chants were mainly in support of the crown prince or of pre-1979 rule.“I am proud of each and every one of you who conquered the streets across Iran on Thursday night,” Pahlavi said in a post on X. “I know that despite the internet shutdown and communication, you won’t leave the streets. Make sure that victory is yours!”Graph showing Iran’s GDP growthPahlavi’s call for more demonstrations on Friday would be a further test of the exiled figure’s popularity and the staying power of protests in the face of the authorities’ crackdown.His organisation alleged that tens of thousands of security officers had signalled their intention to defect via a platform it had set up, and that the organisation had been inundated by requests from officers.‘In isolation, we’ll never flourish’: What Iranians think about the protests and an end to the Islamic RepublicRead moreHuman Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International condemned what they said was authorities’ use of force and mass arbitrary arrests. HRW has documented the deaths of 28 protesters who were shot by security forces between 31 December and 3 January, with instances of authorities using rifles and shotguns loaded with metal pellets.“We have so far documented many of the harrowing patterns of human rights violations that authorities have repeatedly committed during the previous rounds of protest crackdowns, including in November 2019, and the Woman, Life, Freedom protests of 2022,” said Bahar Saba, a senior HRW researcher on Iran and Kuwait.The crackdown seemed only to harden the resolve of protesters, many of whom described scenes of defiance including rocks thrown at officers, forcing them to retreat.Ali, a 21-year-old student in Tehran, said via text message: “Fuck them! The cowards abandoned their vehicles and fled! We took over the streets tonight. We will burn their vans, the same that they use to drag our compatriots and kidnap our sisters from the streets. The country belongs to us!”Anger at the theocratic regime and its clerics seemed to boil over throughout the week. On Wednesday, crowds of men streamed into a Shia seminary in the city of Gonabad, beating staff with sticks and damaging the facility, according to the director of the seminary, Ismail Tavakoli.Another person said unarmed protesters were confronting riot police and throwing rocks in response to bullets fired by officers. “They are vulgar and are saying we are in bed with the Israelis and Americans,” said Farzad, a 37-year-old mobile shop owner in the city of Rasht in northern Iran. “They call us traitors. It’s them that have betrayed the very sense of being an Iranian.”With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiProtestMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Based in the US, Pahlavi, 65, asked people on social media to hoist the pre-1979 “lion and sun” flag, which was used during his father’s rule.He said the Islamic Republic would be brought “to its knees”, adding: “Our goal is no longer merely to come into the streets; the goal is to prepare to seize city centres and hold them.”Explore more on these topicsIranProtestLondonMetropolitan policePolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Elon Musk, the owner of X, wrote on the platform on Friday that the UK government “want any excuse for censorship” and described the British government as “fascist”.View image in fullscreenLammy said he addressed use of Grok with Vance and found vice-president ‘sympathetic’ to UK’s position.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APIn an interview with the Guardian, Lammy said he addressed the use of Grok with Vance and found the vice-president “sympathetic” to the UK’s position.“We discussed Greenland and I also raised with him the Grok issue and the horrendous, horrific situation in which this new technology is allowing deepfakes and the manipulation of images of women and children, which is just absolutely abhorrent. He agreed with me that it was entirely unacceptable,” Lammy said on Friday.Asked if Vance was sympathetic to the UK government’s stance on Grok, Lammy said: “I think he recognised the very seriousness with which images of women and children could be manipulated in this way, and he recognised how despicable, unacceptable, that is and I found him sympathetic to that position. And in fact, we’ve been in touch again, today, about this very serious issue.”“He confirmed with me that he had seen that there had been some changes announced by X as of this morning.”On Friday, X appeared to have changed Grok’s settings, with the chatbot telling users that only paid subscribers could ask it to manipulate images.View image in fullscreenCongresswoman and Trump supporter Anna Paulina Luna has called for sanctions against the UK if it goes through with a ban on X.Photograph: Michael Brochstein/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockHowever, reports suggested this only applied to those making requests in reply to other posts, and other ways of editing or creating images, including on a separate Grok website, remained open.Elon Musk’s X threatened with UK ban over wave of indecent AI imagesRead moreVance also expressed concerns about the use of AI technology, adding that it was being used to fuel “hyper-pornographied slop”, sources at the meeting said.Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, has said she would back the media regulator Ofcom if it decided ban X if it failed to comply with UK laws. “Sexually manipulating images of women and children is despicable and abhorrent,” she said. The media watchdog, Ofcom, confirmed it would accelerate an investigation into X.Musk responded by sharing a post from US legislator Luna threatening to issue sanctions against Keir Starmer and the UK if X was blocked in the country.Lammy and Vance met at a particularly sensitive time for US-UK relations after Trump repeated his claims to Greenland following a US operation to capture the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.View image in fullscreenLiz Kendall, the technology secretary, has said she would back the media regulator, Ofcom, if it decided to ban X.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAStarmer, and other European leaders, issued a statement on Tuesday warning the Danish-held territory’s security must be ensured collectively by Nato.Lammy said he and Vance discussed the war in Ukraine, including “giving the Ukrainians the security guarantees that they require” and the “emerging situation in Venezuela”, as well as tensions over Greenland.International laws and codes are under “tremendous strain”, Lammy said.“We’re realists, and must accept that we’re now living in a multipolar world. It’s a world no longer where there’s just one superpower and the members of the [UN] security council. And so, of course, the rule of law is under tremendous strain. And we lose it, it seems to me, at our peril,” he said.Indonesia blocks Musk’s Grok chatbot due to risk of pornographic contentRead moreLammy, the former foreign secretary, has developed a friendship with Vance.

The move has put him on a collision course with rebel MPs who have criticised the move.Karl Turner, the MP for Kingston upon Hull East, told Times Radio that members of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) were “seething” with Starmer and Lammy over the policy, and said the prime minister “ought to be ashamed of himself”.“I’ve said to the prime minister I want to see him face-to-face on this single issue and I expect him to instruct Lammy to stop and think again,” Turner, a former criminal barrister, said.Explore more on these topicsJD VanceXPornographyDavid LammyInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

And if Ofcom decides to use those powers, they would have the full backing of the government.”The UK government’s concerns were echoed by the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese. Speaking in Canberra on Saturday, Albanese said that “global citizens deserve better”. Australia recently banned the use of social media for under-16s.View image in fullscreenAnthony Albanese.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP“The use of generative artificial intelligence to exploit or sexualise people without their consent is abhorrent,” he said.“The fact that this tool was used so that people were using its image creation function through Grok is just completely abhorrent.

Responding to the news X faced a potential ban, the former prime minister Liz Truss said: “Starmer is really losing it now.”X partially restricted access to Grok on Friday. Its public account lost the ability to generate images at the request of free users, leaving the function available only to paid subscribers. It also appeared to have stopped creating bikini images.The Grok app, however, which does not generate images publicly, is still able to create sexually explicit material from women’s pictures.Other nudificiation apps are still available. The Labour MP Jess Asato, who campaigns against the sexual abuse and harassment of women, said legislation to ban such apps was urgently needed.She posted on social media: “It’s not just XAi.

Officials said the charge against Moore, who lives in the county, is expected to be elevated to capital murder, and prosecutors could seek the death penalty if he is determined to be mentally competent.“This is horrific. It’s about as bad as it gets,” said Scott Colom, the district attorney for Mississippi’s 16th circuit court, which includes Clay county.Sheriff Scott said investigators believe Moore first shot his father, brother and uncle Friday evening. Afterward, Moore allegedly took a truck and drove to another location, where authorities say he attempted to sexually assault a seven-year-old girl who was related to him before shooting her as well.Scott said that in his 30 years of service, this case marked “one of the toughest ones we had to work”.Officials said the initial shooting occurred shortly before 7pm at a residence on David Hill Road. The victims there were identified as Glen Moore, 67; Willie Guines, 55; and Quinton Moore, 33.A call to emergency services led officials to a home on Blake Road where Moore allegedly forced his way in and “attempted to commit a sexual battery while armed”, Scott said. Deputies later found the body of the seven-year-old girl there.Investigators believe Moore then traveled to a home on Siloam-Griffith Road after stealing a Ford F-150 belonging to his deceased brother.At that location, deputies discovered the stolen truck concealed behind the residence and found the bodies of Barry Bradley and Samuel Bradley, who also appeared to have been fatally shot. Scott said one of them was the pastor at a local church.Authorities said it is not yet known whether the Bradleys had any prior relationship with Moore.Moore was later taken into custody at the intersection of Pine Grove Road and Joe Myers Road just before midnight. He was driving a vehicle that investigators say had been taken from the Siloam-Griffith Road home.Officials have not yet determined what motivated the killings.“This has really shaken our community,” Scott told the press conference. “Personally, I don’t know what kind of motive you could have to kill a seven-year-old.“Autopsies will be conducted by the Mississippi crime lab, Scott said.Moore is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Monday. Colom, the district attorney, said the death penalty will be considered in the case.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsnewsShareReuse this content"

That was the fifth anniversary of the January 6 riot, when he was photographed smiling and waving as he carried Pelosi’s lectern after the pro-Trump mob’s attack in 2021.Johnson told WWSB-TV that it was “not a coincidence” that he filed to run for office on 6 January, saying: “It’s definitely good for getting the buzz out there.” His campaign logo is an outline of the viral photograph of him carrying the lectern.A ‘day of love’ with more than 100 casualtiesRead moreHe’s far from the first person implicated in the January 6 Capitol attack to run for office. At least three ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2024 as Republicans. And there are signs that the Republican party is welcoming back more people who were convicted of January 6 offenses after Trump pardoned them.Jake Lang, who was charged with assaulting an officer, civil disorder and other crimes before he was pardoned, recently announced he is running for the Senate seat vacated by Marco Rubio in Florida.Johnson placed the lectern in the center of the Capitol Rotunda, posed for pictures and pretended to make a speech, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty in 2021 of entering and remaining in a restricted building or ground, a misdemeanor that he equated to “jaywalking” in the interview.“I think I exercised my first amendment right to speak and protest,” Johnson said.After driving home, Johnson bragged that he “broke the internet” and was “finally famous”, prosecutors said.Johnson served 75 days in prison followed by one year of supervised release. The judge also ordered Johnson to pay a $5,000 fine and perform 200 hours of community service.Johnson told US district judge Reggie Walton at his sentencing that posing with Pelosi’s lectern was a “very stupid idea”, but now says he only regrets his action because of the prison sentence.“I walked into a building, I took a picture with a piece of furniture and I left,” he now says.Four other Republicans have filed to run so far in the 18 August primary in what is a deeply Republican county. The incumbent isn’t seeking re-election.In March 2025, Johnson filed a lawsuit against Manatee county and six of its commissioners, objecting to the county’s decision not to seek attorney’s fees from someone who sued the county and dropped the lawsuit. The county has called Johnson’s claims “completely meritless and unsupported by law”.Johnson said he objects to high property taxes and overdevelopment in the county south of Tampa, claiming current county leaders are wasteful.“I will be more heavily scrutinized than any other candidate who is running in this race,” Johnson said. “This is a positive and a good takeaway for every single citizen, because for once in our life, we will know our local politicians who are doing things.”Explore more on these topicsFloridaUS Capitol attackUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

US district judge Jia Cobb said that homeland security policies deeming ICE field offices “off-limits for congressional oversight” and requiring seven days’ notice for visits violated federal law.Representatives Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison, both of whom represent districts in the Twin Cities suburbs, were also present and similarly denied entry after first being let inside. According to Omar, she had notified the facility ahead of time that they were planning to visit, and although they were permitted in at first, they were asked to leave roughly 10 minutes later.Omar and her colleagues said they were informed the reason for the denial of access was because the facility’s funding came through the Big Beautiful Bill Act, and that this funding source was being used to justify restricting their visit.“We let ICE know, the Department of Homeland Security know, that they were violating federal law,” said Craig. “They do not care that they are violating federal law. This is beyond the pale. This administration continues to useMinnesotaas a political stunt, and earlier this week, it got a woman killed.”Omar also mentioned observing planes departing from the location, adding she was told those flights were not deportation flights but were moving detainees to other facilities within the US, according toAxios. When asked about the needs of detainees, she said officials claimed they did not remain in custody long enough to require basic hygiene supplies, despiterepeated callsfor improved conditions at various holding facilities.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaIlhan OmarICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US prisonsUS immigrationMinneapolisnewsShareReuse this content"

By doing his best to make the US unbearable both to foreigners and, more generally,people from ethnicitiesthat do not mesh withhis picture ofthe American family, Trump is not Making America Great Again. He is ensuring America will be smaller, older, weaker and easier to push around.Even zeroing-out immigration altogether will be insufficient to restore the bygone America that Trump yearns for. Whatever he does to get rid of immigrants will not stop the non-Hispanic white footprint from shrinking.Trump is not the first politician to try toprotect their conviction about the whiteness of America’s racial stockfrom “foreign” contamination. The national-origin immigration quotas in the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924 were quite successful at doing this. In 1960, 75% of immigrants to the US came from Europe.But the levee broke. The Hart-Celler Act of 1965replaced national-origin with family ties. These days only about 10% of immigrants hail from Europe. More than halfcome from Latin America. When Trump was four, white people accounted for nine in 10 Americans (the census did not ask about Hispanic ethnicity). By 2024, the non-Hispanic white share had slid to 57.5%.Nothing Trump does to stop immigration can change this trajectory. Because the non-Hispanic white population will keep on shrinking regardless, theCensus Bureau projectsthat it will lose 3.6 million people over the next five years, almost 11 million in the decade after that and more than 14 million in the subsequent one.And that means that if Trump and his ethnonationalist sidekick Stephen Miller achieve their goal of cutting future immigration down to nothing, the US population will shrink pretty sharply. It will be 6% smaller by mid-century, 10% smaller by 2060 and one-third smaller in 2100. The president may not fully realize this – his grasp of economics has proven tenuous – the demographic squeeze would come at a substantial cost.The population will not merely shrink. It will get old, because the population of working age will shrink even faster. Today, people over 65 account for about one-fifth of the population. In a zero-immigration scenario, their share will rise to one-quarter by mid-century and over one-third by its end, supported by a shrinking labor force.Chart showing the growing aging population of the USThe data does preoccupy people in the White House. Their prescription, however, is as unrealistic as the rest of their dreams: to boost American fertility, which has been falling over the last two decades and is now at 1.6 children per woman of reproductive age, substantially below the roughly 2.1 replacement rate needed to stabilize the population.Part of the problem is that declining fertility is a global phenomenon that scholarsdo not fully understand. It is happening not only in rich and middle-income countries but also in the world’s poorest countries, where fertility remains comparatively high. Pronatalist policies in developed nations, including child benefits, broader provision of childcare and other family supports, have had alimited impacton families’ propensity to have kids.The other problem is that the proposed solutions from the Trump administrationborder on the absurd. They include a “National Medal of Motherhood” for particularly fecund mothers, fertility tracking classes and $1,000 to be deposited into “Trump accounts” for babies born during his presidency. These come amid a torrent of policies that will make childbearing tougher, such as cuts to federal support forchildren’s healthcareand nutrition, courtesy of the president’s tax-cutting bill.Trump’s problem, in a nutshell, is that the one straightforward policy approach to ease America’s demographic challenge is to rely on people for whom he has expressed unconstrained disgust: non-white immigrants.In the Census Bureau’s high immigration scenario – in which net immigration averages some 1.5m per year – the US population would grow 13% by 2050 and 28% by the end of the century. The 65-plus share would not hit one quarter until 2070.One challenge to this scenario is that there may not be sufficient immigrants available to keep propping up the American population, especially as fertility rates drop in Latin America and Asia too. Net immigration to the US averaged 1.8m per year between 2020 and 2024, driven by a surge after the Covid pandemic. But it only hit about 900,000 a year in the decade before that.The bigger conundrum for the president is another, though. The unadulterated, non-Hispanic white footprint will shrink under any scenario. But if immigration is high, it will drop faster: from 58% of the population this year to under 47% in 2050. The Hispanic share would rise from just under 20% to almost 26%.The challenge must be torturing the guy: if Trump wants to keep America great, he must let it get browner.Explore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

That hasn’t been an issue for theCBSEvening News with Tony Dokoupil.The nightly broadcast has received close scrutiny – and a heap of criticism – since its official launch on Monday, and unofficial launch two nights earlier, when the anchor hosted a special edition after the US attack on Venezuela.Over its first week on air, the Evening News has had no issues booking newsmaker interviews, including with senior Trump administration officials and Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado – though Dokoupil faced backlash for not sufficiently challenging some of his guests.‘Blood in the water’: Bari Weiss’s chaotic first three months in charge of CBS NewsRead moreWhen Dokoupil was first announced as anchor of the show, the network laid out an ambitious plan to tour 10 cities in 10 days, bringing the well-coiffed television veteran to communities across the country. But the news cycle moves quickly in Donald Trump’s America. The best-laid-out network plans can often go sideways.Thursday’s edition of the show was originally scheduled for Denver, Colorado, but Dokoupil was instead rerouted to Minnesota after an ICE agent killed a US woman there on Wednesday.Due to the tour, Wednesday night’s episode had ended with a friendly helicopter ride-along segment with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, and a discussion of the team’s cheerleaders. “This is the problem with doing a fun tour around the nation when you’re doing our leading hard-news program,” one CBS News staffer, not authorized to speak publicly, told the Guardian.After days of negative headlines andtough reviews, Dokoupil got some praise on Wednesday night for pressing border czar Tom Homan on whether immigration agents had used excessive force. The interview made news when Homan seemed to differ fromthe official Department of Homeland Security line: that the woman killed, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, had intentionally tried to hit the officer with her car. “It would be unprofessional to comment on what I think happened in that situation,” Homan said, after Dokoupil showed him a video of the incident. “Let the investigation play out and hold people accountable based on the investigation.”But that news-making interview was overshadowed soon after, when one of the show’s top producers, Javier Guzman, was abruptly terminated, causing confusion on Wednesday night in the network’s New York newsroom, where he was spotted with his belongings. The network did not provide an explanation for Guzman’s dismissal,which the Guardian first reported, though sources said it stemmed from interpersonal dynamics.Tom Bettag, a University of Maryland journalism professor who served as executive producer of the Evening News during Dan Rather’s tenure, contrasted the Homan interview favorably with Dokoupil’s extended interview on Saturday with Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, which drew criticism for being insufficiently challenging.“His interview with Tom Homan was remarkably combative in a courteous manner,” Bettag said. “That interview was the very opposite of the Hegseth interview. Perhaps someone got to him.” (The Hegseth interviewwas booked directly by Weiss, who has flexed her network of contacts to try to land key interviewsduring her first three months as editor-in-chief.)The show has been at its best when leaning on strong reporting from correspondents in the field, including senior national security correspondent Charlie D’Agata, new hire Matt Gutman, homeland security correspondent Nicole Sganga in Minneapolis, Lilia Luciano from the Colombia-Venezuela border and Ed O’Keefe from the White House.Dokoupil, 45, has never hosted his own show before, though he had co-hosted the network’s morning show since 2019. While the relaunch of a network news show would normally attract some interest, the network – and Dokoupil himself – have received extra attention because he waspicked by Weiss, who made revamping CBS Evening News one of her top priorities.Clips from Evening News have been shared widely on social media, generating strong reactions. “Before this week I had not seen a single clip of the network nightly news on here since the [ABC anchor] David Muir dad jeans pic went viral like 7 years ago. Simpler times,” wrote The Bulwark’s Tim Miller in a post on X.Dokoupil himself raised the stakes for the show whenhe said in a postthat his version would be “more transparent and accountable” than that of the legendary CBS anchor Walter Cronkite. Bettag, who served as a producer for Cronkite in his final years, said the revered anchor “would have never said anything so self-serving”, but he expressed confidence in Dokoupil’s interviewing skills, citing his past work.On Monday, Dokoupil hosted his official launch edition from New York City. While the show featured strong on-air reporting, it got more attention on social media for an awkward moment when Dokoupil seemed ready to present a segment about Minnesota governor Tim Walz, who hadannounced he wouldn’t run for re-election– but instead was greeted with an on-screen photo of Arizona senator Mark Kelly. “First day, first day, big problems here,” Dokoupil acknowledged, asking the control room: “Are we going to Kelly here?”Social media lit into Dokoupil particularly hard on Tuesday night, when he hosted the first stop of his around-the-country tour in Miami. He was panned for what seemed to be a glowing tribute to secretary of state Marco Rubio – “Whatever you think of his politics, you’ve got to admit it’s an impressive resume,” he declared – and for a very brief mention of the fifth anniversary of the January 6 Capitol insurrection that was decried as an example of both-sides-ism. “President Trump today accused Democrats of failing to prevent the attack on the Capitol, while House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries accused the president of ‘whitewashing’ it,” Dokoupil said.While judging a show on a few days of viewership data is unfair, it will be a tall task for Dokoupil to get the CBS Evening News out of its longtime spot in third place. Monday’s CBS Evening News brought in 4.4m viewers, an improvement over the show’s recent performance, but far below the 8.1m viewers for ABC’s World News Tonight with David Muir, and 7.2m for NBC Nightly News with Tom Llamas.CBS News staffers expressed concern about what Guzman’s abrupt dismissal portends for the show. “Javier was one of the few grown-ups left who know how to put on a nightly newscast to the standard of CBS Evening News,” said another network staffer, also not authorized to speak publicly.Jay Cowit, a friend and former colleague, called Guzman “a traditional old-school journalist down to his bones”, adding: “Nobody I’ve ever met in two decades of media has been more dedicated to the presence and crucial importance of news in our lives.”Guzman did not respond to messages seeking comment.Ending Thursday’s show from Minnesota, Dokoupil offered a commentary on the killing of Good, contrasting the outrage of protesters he spoke with to emails he received “from people who want to see our immigration laws enforced, legally, and peacefully, and with safety for all”.“Our job now is maybe the most American thing of all: it’s to find a way to live with people who are genuinely different from us, to try to be fair to them, and in doing so to make things better and keep things decent, because in America no one else is going to do it for us,” he said. “It’s not my job to tell you what to think about what happened here yesterday, but I can tell you we owe our children a nation that is better than the one we live in today.”Dokoupil received many messages of praise on social media for his comments, but one viewerfelt differently. “Ditch the final thoughts,” they wrote. “Just tell us the news.”Explore more on these topicsMediaCBSParamount PicturesUS television industryUS press and publishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Video of the encounter shows agents ordering her to exit the car and attempting to open the driver’s side door. As Good tried to pull away, one agent stepped in front of the vehicle and another fired shots, killing her.The incident has sparked protests across the Twin Cities and intensified scrutiny of federal immigration enforcement tactics. US president Donald Trump and senior administration officials have said the agent acted in self-defense, claiming Good used her vehicle as a weapon – a description disputed by Minnesota governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey, and other local officials, who have characterized the shooting as reckless.\"It's shameful that the government can come out and lie about what happened when there's video and witnesses who have all come out and disputed what the government is saying.\"Warriors coach Steve Kerr was asked about the ICE shooting in Minneapolis. Here are his full comments:pic.twitter.com/L592dSPvvw— Ben Ross (@BenRossTweets)January 10, 2026“I’m glad that the Timberwolves recognized her life and the tragic nature of her death,” Kerr said, referring tothe moment of silence held Thursday nightbefore Minnesota’s home game against Cleveland. “It’s shameful, really, that in our country we can have law enforcement officers who commit murder and seemingly get away with it.“It’s shameful that the government can come out and lie about what happened when there’s video and witnesses who have all come out and disputed what the government is saying. So, very demoralizing, devastating to lose anyone’s life, especially in that manner. So it’s terrible, terribly sad for her family, and for her, and that city, and I’m glad the Timberwolves came out and expressed that sadness.”Timberwolves coach Chris Finch addressed the shooting before Thursday’s game, offering condolences to Good’s family and acknowledging the toll the incident has taken on the Minneapolis community. “Our community has suffered yet another unspeakable tragedy,” Finch said. “We want to convey our heartfelt wishes and prayers to everyone affected.”Kerr, 60, has long beenone of the most outspoken figuresin American professional sports on political and social issues, particularly around gun violence and accountability in law enforcement. He has frequently criticized Trump and his administration during both of Trump’s terms in office, using his platform to speak on issues that extend well beyond basketball.Explore more on these topicsGolden State WarriorsNBAMinneapolisBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

This was a controlled, clinical performance from Liam Rosenior’s second string, who strolled into the fourth round of the FA Cup after a 5-1 win over a game but limitedCharlton Athletic, but once again the big talking point was the travelling support spewing venom in the direction of their unpopular owners.Dissatisfaction with the project is not going away. It did not even matter when Rosenior looked at his bench withChelsea3-1 up in the second half and decided to give Estevão Willian a runout against tired, lowly Championship opposition. The Brazilian winger is one of the best young players in the world and his runs were soon making Charlton’s defenders dizzy, but even signings like Estêvão have done little to sway the view of a fanbase united in opposition to an ownership almost four years in and still to convince naysayers that their unique vision will bring success.Charlton v Chelsea: FA Cup third round – liveRead moreIt has been a tough few weeks. Enzo Maresca’s departure was messy, his relationship with the board broken, leading sceptics to accuse Chelsea of becoming unmanageable. Rosenior, after all, is the fifth head coach since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital bought the club in 2022.The 41-year-old has signed a six-and-a-half-year deal but even the manner of his appointment was unusual, bearing in mind the sensitivities around BlueCo, the consortium that owns both Chelsea and Strasbourg, taking the Englishman away from the smaller club under its control with the season in full swing.Rosenior has had to hit back at the idea that he is a puppet for Chelsea’s owners. In the away end, though, the dissent started early. There were chants for Roman Abramovich in the first minute and it was not long before the travelling fans were spewing venom about Clearlake, the private equity firm with a major say in Chelsea’s trading model being controlled by a team of five sporting directors.Rosenior was aware of the unrest but did not want to dwell on it. “If your fans are happy it means you’re doing a good job,” he said. “This is a team that won the Club World Cup five months ago. We’re a good team.”Yet the jury certainly remains out on some of the squad building. Some of Chelsea’s problems this season have come after rotating, although Rosenior was never going to send out his strongest side with the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Arsenal to come on Wednesday. Cole Palmer and Reece James were rested and there were rare runouts in attack for Facundo Buonanotte, Jamie Gittens and Marc Guiu.View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior saw his side pull away in the second half.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianA vocal presence on the touchline, Rosenior was happy with Buonanotte, Gittens, Guiu and Alejandro Garnacho. There was no great shift away from Maresca’s system. Chelsea dominated possession throughout the first half and were patient against a deep defence.Charlton, five points above the Championship’s bottom three after one win in their last six games, offered little. That the opening goal came from Jorrel Hato, though, was a reminder that this is a chance to turn over a new leaf. The 19-year-old was in for the suspended Marc Cucurella at left-back and looked eager to prove that Maresca was wrong to discard him after a nightmare display against Qarabag in November.Hato kept popping up in dangerous positions and eventually rammed a loose ball past Mannion to make it 1-0. Chelsea pushed for more at the start of the second half. It was 2-0 when the unmarked Tosin Adarabioyo glanced Buonanotte’s free-kick in at the near post.View image in fullscreenAn unmarked Tosin Adarabioyo guides a header goalwards and doubles Chelsea’s lead.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHowever, Rosenior must curb his side’s tendency to give away soft goals. Charlton had hope when Miles Leaburn capitalised on poor marking from a corner and halved the deficit in the 57th minute. “We need to improve,” Rosenior said. “They are the basics I talk about. I was disappointed to concede but our reaction was magnificent.”Chelsea responded when Garnacho drove in from the left, Buonanotte had a shot saved and Guiu collected his second goal of the season by turning the loose ball past Mannion.There was time for Pedro Neto to come on and drive in a fourth. Estevão then capped off a sparkling cameo by winning a penalty for Enzo Fernández, another of the substitutes, to score with the final kick of the game. But the resentment towards Clearlake lingered.Explore more on these topicsFA CupCharlton AthleticChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Medical examinations carried out later that night at a hospital revealed a fracture, and the club said Pepi will undergo surgery on Sunday. PSV did not indicate any complications but ruled the striker out for the immediate future.The 2026 World Cup may transform US soccer. The 2030 World Cup could be even betterRead more“It didn’t look good right away and at such a moment you would prefer to look the other way,” PSV head coach Peter Boszsaid in a statement. “Last January Ricardo was already out due to his knee injury. It won’t last that long now, but unfortunately we lost him again.”Pepi was forced off shortly after the incident and did not return to the match, which PSV went on to win by a 5-1 scoreline. The setback halts a period of strong form for the American forward, who had re-established himself after recovering from his previous knee issue.“Pepi was on a good run, had a strong training camp and was all the way back,” Bosz said. “He became more confident in rounding and was in that good flow again. All signs were green for a strong second half of the season, so this is incredibly disappointing. First and foremost for him and obviously for us as well.”The injury also raises questions for the United States as they build toward this summer’s World Cup. Pepi has been a regular presence in the national team setup, scoring 13 goals in 34 appearances, and featured in the most recent international window in November.With the US set to open its World Cup campaign on June 12 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Pepi now faces a race against time to return to full fitness, while his availability for upcoming friendlies against Belgium on 28 March and Portugal three days later remains uncertain.Explore more on these topicsPSV EindhovenUSAUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The 41-year-old American’s second success and fourth podium from four downhills this season increased the veteran skier’s lead in the standings and cemented her favourite status for next month’s Winter Olympics.Already the oldest World Cup winner of all time, Vonn was fastest by 0.37sec from Norway’s Kajsa Vickhoff Lie with a run of 1min 06.24sec on a cold and cloudy morning with snow falling in Zauchensee, Austria. Another American, Jacqueline Wiles, completed the podium, 0.48 slower than Vonn, on a piste considerably shortened after Friday’s training was cancelled due to heavy snowfall.Lindsey Vonn, 41, adds yet another podium to blistering comeback startRead more“I honestly thought with my start number that I had no chance, because there’s so much snow and there wasn’t really a track at No 6,” Vonn told TNT Sports. “I had to risk a lot with my line to really stay in the hunt. I executed my plan really well, I brought good intensity to my race. Again, I thought I had no chance so I just swung really hard. I was like: ‘I could be last, I could be first. I have no idea but I’m going to do my best.’”View image in fullscreenLindsey Vonn was fastest by 0.37sec from Norway’s Kajsa Vickhoff Lie with a run of 1:06.24.Photograph: Gintare Karpaviciute/ReutersAs the 2010 Olympic downhill champion continued to make critics eat their words with her remarkable form after returning in 2024 following knee surgery, one rival returned and another was flown off the piste by helicopter after a nasty crash.Corinne Suter, the reigning Olympic champion, made her return from a month-long injury absence after a muscle tear in a boost for Swiss hopes although she was outside the top 20 and said she still had a long way to go.There was dismay for Austria when Magdalena Egger crashed into the side netting and, despite getting back on to her feet with a bloodied nose, was put on a stretcher and taken to hospital by helicopter. Egger, second to Vonn in St Moritz last month, lost her balance with her ski tips crossing before she went down and became tangled in the netting, leading to a 25-minute race interruption.The weather deteriorated further after the break but Switzerland’s Janine Schmitt still went from a 24th start to a career-best fifth, behind Italy’s Laura Pirovano. Breezy Johnson, the American world champion, was seventh. Vonn leads Germany’s Emma Aicher, who was sixth, by 129 points with Pirovano third.While the lowered start hurt the chances of some, Vonn said her experience worked in her favour because she had previously raced a sprint from there and was one of the few who knew where to go and where to push.The American, who is also sixth in the overall standings, now looks clear favourite to take the downhill World Cup crystal globe and, barring any drama, extend her career beyond the Olympics to the season-ending finals. The women have a super-G on the same slope on Sunday, with Vonn again in action.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingnewsShareReuse this content"

Miamibeat Mississippi 31-27 in the Fiesta Bowl semi-finalon Thursday night.Indiana will try to give the Big Ten their third straight national title, following Ohio State and Michigan the last two seasons. Few teams from any conference can compare with the Hoosiers’ season-long demonstration of balanced strong play.Led by Mendoza and the defense, Indiana are making a case to be considered among the top teams in history.Though Miami will be home for the national championship game, Mendoza, the Heisman Trophy winner and Miami native, will enjoy a homecoming following an almost perfect game against Oregon. Mendoza completed 17 of 20 passes and the five touchdowns, including two to Elijah Sarratt and a 36-yarder to Charlie Becker.Kaelon Black ran for two touchdowns to lead the Indiana running game.Oregon (13-2, No 5 CFP) was doomed by the three first-half turnovers while also being short-handed by the absence of two of their top running backs.The Hoosiers led 35-7 at halftime as the Ducks were held to nine rushing yards on 17 carries. Noah Whittington, who leads Oregon with 829 rushing yards, was held out with an undisclosed injury after Jordon Davison, who had rushed for 667 yards and 15 touchdowns, already was listed as out with a collarbone injury.Backup running backs, including Jay Harris and Dierre Hill Jr, provided too little help for quarterback Dante Moore. Moore’s task against Indiana’s stifling defense would have been daunting even with all his weapons.View image in fullscreenIndiana head coach Curt Cignetti holds up the trophy after the Peach Bowl.Photograph: Mike Stewart/APIndiana’s defense didn’t wait long to make an impact. On Oregon’s first snap, cornerback D’Angelo Ponds intercepted Moore’s pass intended for Malik Benson and returned the pick 25 yards for a touchdown. Only 11 seconds into the game, the Hoosiers and their defense already had made a statement this would be a long night for Moore and the Oregon offense.Moore’s 19-yard scoring pass to tight end Jamari Johnson tied the game. The remainder of the half belonged to Indiana and its big-play defense.After Mendoza’s eight-yard touchdown pass to Omar Cooper Jr. gave the Hoosiers the lead for good at 14-7, Indiana’s defense forced a turnover when Moore fumbled and Indiana recovered at the Oregon 3, setting up Black’s scoring run.Moore lost a second fumble later in the second quarter when hit by Daniel Ndukwe and Mario Landino recovered at the Oregon 21. Mendoza’s first scoring pass to Sarratt gave the Hoosiers’ the 35-7 lead.Indiana extended their lead to 42-7 on Mendoza’s 13-yard scoring pass to EJ Williams Jr.Oregon finally answered. A 70-yard run by Hill set up a two-yard scoring run by Harris.Indiana’s special teams added a big play in the fourth quarter when Ndukwe’s blocked punt set up Mendoza’s second scoring pass to Sarratt.Following their undefeated regular season, the Hoosiers have only gained momentum in the CFP. Indianaoverwhelmed Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl quarter-finalas Mendoza passed for 192 yards and three touchdowns.Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber was an honorary captain for Indiana and watched the game from the Hoosiers’ sideline. Former Oregon and Carolina Panthers running back Jonathan Stewart was the Ducks’ honorary captain.Indiana completed a sweep of two games against Oregon this season. Defense played a lead role in each win. The Hoosiers took a 30-20 win at Oregon on 11 October when Moore threw two interceptions and was sacked six times.The game was a sellout and the red-clad Indiana fans were almost as dominant as the Hoosiers on the field. Indiana appeared to claim at least 80% of the 75,604 fans.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballIndianaCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Somehow, the star-studded Premier League team who compete in Europe were overwhelmed and deservedly beaten by their sixth-tier hosts, becoming the first cup holders to lose to non-league opposition since 1909.The fact Palace included three of their cup winning side, in Adam Wharton, Chris Richards and captain Marc Guéhi – who all struggled – just emphasised the scale of the upset. Even Oliver Glasner admitted it was a “David against Goliath story”.Macclesfield v Crystal Palace: FA Cup third round – liveRead moreYet this was all aboutMacclesfield, who were inspired by their manager John Rooney, brother of former Manchester United striker Wayne, and playing for the memory of their teammate Ethan McLeod, who died in a car accident last month. On the pitch, they were spearheaded by Paul Dawson, their brilliant captain, whose powerful header set the upset in motion before half-time before Isaac Buckley-Ricketts added a scrappy second on the hour mark.Yeremy Pino’s late free-kick was Palace’s only moment of quality and ensured nerves set in for the sell-out crowd of 5,348, but Macclesfield were not to be denied. Ecstatic scenes followed. The pitch invasion that came after the full-time whistle, those bear-hugs between players and fans who began partying into the night; none of it will be forgotten in a hurry in this corner of Cheshire.Quick GuideTen other FA Cup shocksShow1.Hereford 2 Newcastle 1 (1972)2.Stoke 2 Blyth Spartans 3 (1978)3.Sutton 2 Coventry 1 (1989)4.Wrexham 2 Arsenal 1 (1992)5.Leicester 1 Wycombe 2 (2001)6.Chelsea 2 Bradford 4 (2015)7.Crawley 3 Leeds 0 (2021)8.Newcastle 0 Cambridge 1 (2022)9.Ipswich 1 Maidstone 2 (2024)10.Plymouth 1 Liverpool 0 (2025)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It still doesn’t feel real,” said a beaming Rooney . “I spoke before the game about having a bit of hope in theFA Cup, but did I really believe it? Probably not. It’s mad to say but I thought we were deserved winners on the day. I thought we were incredible.“I’m really proud on a personal note but also proud of the players. What they’ve created here is something unbelievable. It’s one of them where you don’t really believe it’s happened.”View image in fullscreenPaul Dawson (with a bandaged head) scores the opening goal for Macclesfield against Crystal Palace.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAMacclesfield’s squad is full of part-timers who hold down jobs away from football in teaching, law and property, yet here they were dominating Premier League opponents. Throughout the contest they looked more than a match for their illustrious visitors, with Dawson resembling Terry Butcher after his head was strapped after an early collision.As Palace backed off, seemingly irked by Macclesfield’s intensity and physicality, it was clear the Silkmen sensed their moment could be close. Dawson’s goal was comic strip stuff, a perfectly timed header after he latched on to Luke Duffy’s free-kick, and it was hardly against the run of play.If ever a player was deserving of a goal it was the captain, who roared off to celebrate with the home fans. The noise was as loud as anything this ground has heard since Macclesfield’s rebirth in 2020, their first taste of the third round in their current iteration.View image in fullscreenIsaac Buckley-Ricketts (right) took advantage of several botched efforts to clear by Crystal Palace to score Macclesfield’s second goal.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAGlasner had to react at half-time and he duly did, sending on the cavalry as Brennan Johnson, Will Hughes and Tyrick Mitchell were introduced and the visitors’ formation changed. It was more of the same as the second half started in a frenzy. Suddenly Palace found themselves 2-0 down after Buckley-Ricketts steered home. Their defence, led by Guéhi, looked listless and confused dealing with second-half balls sent up into the low sun.“To explain that performance, or try to find some excuse, would be completely wrong,” said Glasner.View image in fullscreenMacclesfield’s Josh Kay celebrates with supporters amid a pitch invasion at the final whistle.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PARooney said he had told his team at half-time to try to run the clock down and frustrate Palace, but he was able to watch on with the luxury of a two-goal lead for much of the second half. Only Pino’s free-kick set his heart racing, but he was soon able to embrace Francis Jeffers, his assistant, as the whistle went.In the chaos of the celebrations, Rooney then enjoyed a “really special” moment with his brother Wayne, who was working as a BBC pundit covering the game.What next for the conquerors of the cup holders? “We’d love a big away trip but you cannot beat playing here in front of these fans,” said Rooney. “I’m so proud to give these fans that moment today.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupMacclesfieldCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

In the Rams’ worst loss of the season,to the Panthers in November, Stafford held his team back from taking a commanding lead with two picks in the first quarter. Keep it tight.NFL playoff predictions: who will seize a wide-open Super Bowl race?Read moreWhat the Panthers need to do to winThe Panthers are massive underdogs but hold an advantage in the vital experience of having already upset the Rams.

Head coach Dave Canales needs to deliver a sequel on par with Paddington 2 to take the Rams out again.

Pro Football Focus’s offensive player of the year, he earned the highest grade ever given to a wideout by their gurus (since records began in 2006) when he dominated the Cardinals in week 14.

Note: All times US Eastern. Logos: SportsLogos.netGreen Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (Saturday, 8pm EST/Sunday 1am GMT)What the Packers need to do to winSuck the life out of Chicago’s big-play defense. Give them absolutely nothing to work with – or at least as little as possible. Run the ball down their throats, let the frustration creep and creep, even if trailing by a few points. As the mental fog descends, completely let it rip with Jordan Love unleashing Christian Watson’s punishing deep threat. Taking too many early shots downfield risks playing to a major Bears strength.What the Bears need to do to winTake a history lesson. Beating the Packers in the playoffs is possible. George Halas’s Bears thrashed the Packers 33-14 on 14 December 1941, the week after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, in Chicago’s only postseason win overtheir division rivals. The key to victory that day was George McAfee, Norm Standlee and Bob Swisher combining for more than 200 yards rushing and three touchdowns. If the tribute act of D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai can recreate that stunning display it would take a heap of pressure off the shoulders of Caleb Williams. Let the young quarterback grow into his first playoff appearance slowly.Key playerKevin Byard, S, Bears. The 32-year-old is the leader of Chicago’s turnover factory that topped the NFL in interceptions (23) and total takeaways (33). He contributed seven picks in a mighty return to form from his early years with the Titans.PredictionBears over PackersView image in fullscreenJosh Allen struggled under pressure at points this season, taking 16 sacks in four Bills defeats.Photograph: Gene J Puskar/APBuffalo Bills at Jacksonville Jaguars (Sunday, 1pm EST/6pm GMT)What the Bills need to do to winProtect Josh Allen. A thread runs through Buffalo’s five regular-season defeats: Allen feeling intense pressure, taking sacks and giving the ball away. Houston: eight sacks, two picks. Atlanta: four sacks, two picks, two fumbles. Miami: three sacks, one pick, one fumble. New England: one sack, one pick, one fumble. Jacksonville will be acutely aware this is the route to stymying Allen. The offense needs to be ready to beat back or help the QB escape the wave of pressure heading his way from kick-off.What the Jaguars need to do to win“You don’t make the playoffs without being a strong defense able to take away something,” said Jaguars OC Joe Brady. Jacksonville needs to keep the success rolling by stopping James Cook. The matchup against the running back is a tough one; Cook owns the 2025 rushing title with 1,621 yards and 12 touchdowns while the Bills as a whole are first in the NFL in rushing yards per game (160). The Jaguars will not be fazed. They sit at the top of the tree in allowing the fewest yards per game on the ground (86) and 100+ yard games (five). In the seven previous playoff matchups between the No 1 rushers and run stoppers, the defense is 4-3.Key playerJosh Allen, QB, Bills. He’s the most talented player on either roster playing at the most influential position. In what feels likethe biggest coin-flip game of the weekend, having a totem of Allen’s stature could be pivotal.PredictionJaguars over BillsSan Francisco 49ers at Philadelphia Eagles (Sunday, 4.30pm EST/9.30pm GMT)What the 49ers need to do to winPlay to their massive strength in running back Christian McCaffrey. Run the ball, control the clock, then make it count in the red zone. A regular dose of McCaffrey will keep Vic Fangio’s defense honest as they also have to protect the deep pass from Brock Purdy. The 49ers absolutely need to lean into Purdy’s irrepressible downfield throwing if and when the defense triggers too far in McCaffrey’s direction as the quarterback boasts 35 passes of 20+ air yards and is No 1 in success rate in the NFL. If Purdy targets Adoree’ Jackson, the lame duck in Philadelphia’s secondary, his numbers could really pop.View image in fullscreenThe 49ers’ one-two punch of running back Christian McCaffrey and quarterback Brock Purdy is a tall order for the Eagles’ defense.Photograph: Dylan Buell/Getty ImagesWhat the Eagles need to do to winKeep the faith in Jalen Hurts’ legs. The quarterback has shone when given designed running plays down the stretch especially in do-or-die situations. This tactic could be highly effective against a corps of sub-par linebackers. Some eye-catching gains will be money in the bank to remind the quarterback and his offense of the power they can still generate even in a down year. That power demolished Purdy’s 49ers 31-7 in theNFC championship gamein 2023.Key playerTrent Williams, LT, 49ers. With Williams the 49ers have been an offensive juggernaut. Without the stellar pass protector they scored only three points when needing a win over the Seahawks. Fortunately for San Francisco he has returned to practice after a hamstring injury and looks likely to start.PredictionEagles over 49ersKicking zones and a ban on losing teams: NFL playoff tweaks we’d like to seeRead moreLos Angeles Chargers at New England Patriots (Sunday, 8pm EST/Monday 1am GMT)What the Chargers need to do to winJustin Herbert needs to get rid of the ball quickly. The Chargers have used 25 different offensive line combinations in 17 games and as such the amorphous blob in front of the quarterback have allowed the most hits in the NFL (129). New England’s strong pass rushing duo of Milton Williams and Christian Barmore are going to blow Herbert up if he holds on to the ball any longer than necessary.What the Patriots need to do to winNew England have found great success when using jumbo packages to power the running game. Over the course of the season, they’ve had six linemen on the field for 66 rushing attempts, and they’re second in the NFL with 6.7 yards per carry when using that setup. In the four games since their bye week in December the Patriots leaned into the strategy with outstanding results as 47 of those 66 runs garnered 8.3 yards per attempt. The Chargers have a sound defense but one that will probably still be overmatched by the power of Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson running behind the six pack.Key playerDrake Maye, QB, Patriots. The likely MVP’s impressive ball security will be as important as his explosive production, which topped the charts among starting quarterbacks in yards per attempt (9), against a Chargers defense that recorded the NFL’s third-most interceptions (19).PredictionPatriots over ChargersView image in fullscreenDefensive end Will Anderson Jr is the linchpin of a menacing Houston defense.Photograph: Erik Williams/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockHouston Texans at Pittsburgh Steelers (Monday, 8.15pm EST/Tuesday 1.15am GMT)What the Texans need to do to winKeep up the improvements in red zone efficiency. The Texans have struggled inside the 20-yard line this season ranking 29th in scoring at a rate of 46.3%. They did boost their number to 60% in their final three games showing promise for what will be a tough encounter with the Steelers. Pittsburgh are the seventh-best red zone defense giving up scores on 50.9% of trips by the opposition. You can bet your house thathead coach Mike Tomlinwill have his Steelers playing above that level on Monday night. The Texans need to be ready with a bag of tricks to overcome it.What the Steelers need to do to winThey need the hottest of starts to try to catch the mighty Texans defense on their heels. Win the toss, receive possession and throw everything to gain the scoreboard advantage with a view to never letting it go. The added bonus will be rallying one of the NFL’s loudest and enthusiastic home crowds around the team and Tomlin.Boos could be heard againwhen the Steelers were struggling against the Ravens but it just about worked out. Now that Tomlin has steered their rickety team to the playoffs he may have full support. If not then an early lead will help ease the tension.Key playerWill Anderson Jr, DE, Texans. Houston are a menace. It starts with a stifling secondary that paralyses the opposition quarterback. It finishes with a sack in the tumbling embrace of Anderson. Aaron Rodgers is in for a hellish night regardless of the outcome.PredictionTexans over SteelersExplore more on these topicsNFLLos Angeles RamsCarolina PanthersGreen Bay PackersChicago BearsBuffalo BillsJacksonville JaguarsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Isabeau Levito earned the bronze medal with 224.45 points and, more than likely, the final women’s spot on the squad for the Winter Games.The official team announcement comes Sunday.Amber Glenn's IMMACULATE free skate earns her 150.50 to give her the Women's National Title with a total score of 233.55! 👏📺 NBC and Peacockpic.twitter.com/FQMDad063S— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics)January 10, 2026“Just so grateful. That was terrifying,” said Glenn, who has been on a dominant tear over the past two years. “And I had to skate after two incredible ladies brought down the house. I’m still just mind-blown.”Earlier in the night, Alisha Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov defended their pairs title despite a couple of mistakes, including a scary moment when Mitrofanov was nearly clipped by Efimova’s skate. They finished with 207.71 points to outdistance Ellie Kam and Danny O’Shea, who were second with 197.12, and the team of Katie McBeath and Daniil Parkman.Ilia Malinin electrifies US nationals with quad-packed short programRead moreNow comes a nervous wait to see whether Efimova and Mitrofanov can compete at the Olympics.While he is a US citizen, born in Wisconsin and raised in Texas, the 26-year-old Efimova was born in Finland and has competed for Germany and Russia along with her native country. Only citizens of the nation they represent are eligible for the Olympics, though, and while Mitrofanov and Efimova are married and she has a green card, she has not received an American passport yet.The Skating Club of Boston, where the couple trains, has been working with US senators and US Figure Skating officials to get the three-year waiting period for citizenship expedited. But time is running out before Sunday’s deadline to announce the team.The Americans have qualified the maximum three women’s spots on the Olympic team.They only have two spots in pairs.Efimova and Mitrofanov would get one, should her citizenship get approved at the last minute. Kam and O’Shea are near locks to make their first Olympic team, while McBeath and Parkman are unable to go because he likewise does not have US citizenship.View image in fullscreenFrom left to right, silver medalist Alysa Liu, gold medalist Amber Glenn, bronze medalist Isabeau Levito and fourth-place finisher Bradie Tennell pose with their medals after Friday’s free skate.Photograph: Jeff Roberson/APThat could leave US Figure Skating to make a judgment call on the second pairs team it sends to the Milan Cortina Games.Emily Chan and Spencer Howe rallied from eighth after a difficult short program to finish fourth with 186.52 points Friday night, while the up-and-coming team of Audrey Shin and Balazs Nagy were less than two points behind in fifth place.Yet ahead of them all were Efimova and Mitrofanov, the clear-cut best of American pairs skating.Their free skate, set to Where Do I Begin? from the 1970 Arthur Hiller romantic drama Love Story, was intended to be a tribute to two-time Olympic champions Katia Gordeeva and Sergey Grinkov, who was just 28 when he died of a heart attack in 1995.Efimova and Mitrofanov opened with a beautiful triple twist, but then a sequence went awry after their triple salchow when he fell during a double axel, and Efimova nearly wiped his forehead with her skate blade. She also struggled on their side-by-side triple toe loops later in the program, but a strong finishing sequence left no doubt that they would repeat as champions.Then it was the women’s turn to take center stage.Levito was up first among the American “big three”, performing with her trademark balletic style in a sparkly blue dress to music from the 1988 Italian coming-of-age film Cinema Paradiso – just image that on the ice in Milan next month.Her free skate score represented a season-best and thrust Levito into first place.Liu clapped when the score was read amid her own warm-up, then proceeded to rip through the debut of a new free skate set to a medley of Lady Gaga songs. It was a performance every bit as good as Liu’s showing at the world championships in Boston last year, when she became thefirst American to stand atop the podiumin two decades.The pressure was on Glenn to respond. And did she ever.From her opening triple axel, the only three-and-a-half-revolution jump that any of the medal contenders attempted, to the final chords of music, the 26-year-old from Plano, Texas, had the crowd on its feet. Glenn skated off to a standing ovation, then broke down in tears along with her coach, Damon Allen, when her huge score was read over the arena loudspeakers.She was soon joined in the kiss-and-cry area by Liu and Levito, the likely triumvirate for the Milano Cortina Games.“I hope,” Liu said, “we can keep this energy next month for all of us.”Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingAlysa LiuAmber GlennUS sportsShareReuse this content"

As fans celebratedvictory over the holders, Crystal Palace, many took their time to peel away from the stadium. Not too long ago, many feared they may never return to Moss Rose.Macclesfield Town FC, 1874-2020 was the etching on the gravestone of the club that died, mourned quietly by a town that had slowly lost touch with events at the shambling football ground on its southern tip, pretty much the last stop before the long drive to London begins.New outfits and snow disruption: inside Macclesfield before jackpot FA Cup tieRead moreSo ruinous were finances the old club, recently relegated from League Two after repeated points sanctions, waslost to the receivers in September 2020. Despair was heightened by the Covid pandemic restricting movement and football economics. The game’s authorities appeared uncaring, offering little but a shrugging response to a business going bad and paying the consequences. It would take sensible, if initially impulsive, business practice to create the phoenix club.Rob Smethurst is the local entrepreneur whobought Moss Rose’s fixtures and fittingsfrom the Rightmove website. Such a whim – a snap decision Smethurst, who has put in £4m, readily admits was taken while heavily under the influence – soon restored the club to its town. The 4G pitch that so troubled Crystal Palace on Saturday proved the crucial factor, allowing locals to train and play on the surface through the week, driving revenue.View image in fullscreenMacclesfield fans celebrate on the pitch at Moss Rose after their seismic FA Cup shock.Photograph: Chris Radburn/ReutersIt brought the people back down London Road, as did gym facilities and a high-end bar where many fans gathered to watch Euro 2020 the following summer. On matchdays, with drinks allowed in view of the field at Macclesfield’s level, the club operates as a social club, a place to meet friends and make merry on a pitchside terrace serving quality produce.Robbie Savage, Smethurst’s close friend,served as a willing frontmanand hype man for five years, last season leading the club to the National League North as manager, his media profile bringing abouttwo BBC documentariesthat showed off those behind the scenes.This was, though, no vanity project but a collective mission. Many of those involved had been scarred by what happened to Town. When the former owner Amar Alkadhi was still around, operating as an absentee landlord, the Star Lane scoreboard bearing the legend “Amar Out” on Boxing Day 2019 spelled out what the majority thought.The old club, though it had two spells in the Football League, had a proud non-league history and those days were soon enough restored by Macclesfield FC with consecutive promotions, including last season’s under Savage.Macclesfield is not Wrexham, hand-picked by Hollywood execs to show off UK working-class folk and then paired with two American screen stars. Rumour has it the town was passed over for what became Disney’s Wrexham project because, being in Cheshire, and surrounded by villages that house the north-west’s footballer and stockbroker belts, it was too bourgeois. The town retains a tough, working-class edge, particularly in the area where the ground is situated. Open skies that reach up to the surrounding Peak District can make it an eerie place to visit.View image in fullscreenJohn Rooney, Macclesfield’s manager, stands by the memorial to the late Ethan McLeod  before the match against Crystal Palace.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/ShutterstockBeing adjacent to that elite football community had benefits beyond Savage’s involvement. Wayne Rooney, long resident nearby, occasionally took in games from the tiny main stand. His cousin Tommy Rooney even made a couple of appearances. On Saturday, the elder Rooney could not hold back the tears when his younger brother John masterminded the win over Palace, the younger sibling twice a Macc player who replaced Savage as manager.There was added poignancy, too, in players asked to shine in the face of losing a colleague and friend. It was on 16 December thatEthan McLeod, a 21-year-old striker, died in a car accidenton the M1. His parents were in the stands on Saturday as the Silkmen pulled off the victory John Rooney and Smethurst made sure todedicate to their son.If football is still the people’s game, then Macc’s rise from the ashes to a day of historic glory in the January sun may be the perfect embodiment of that.Explore more on these topicsFA CupMacclesfieldCrystal PalaceanalysisShareReuse this content"

A performance that put an end to any realistic chance of a trophy fell well below the expectations of a furious crowd. That their opponents currently offer the diametric opposite of Tottenham’s dysfunction can only have heightened the sting.Goals from Emi Buendía and Morgan Rogers put this tie to bed for Villa in the first half, Wilson Odobert’s strike after half-time bringing a closeness to the scoreline that was not reflected in the general play. A scuffle on the field at the final whistle involving Rogers, João Palhinha and a host of Tottenham players only added further sourness to the occasion.Tottenham v Aston Villa: FA Cup third round – liveRead more“I think it was a good second half,” Frank said afterwards. “We played with energy passion and intensity, how we want to play. We scored a good goal and had other opportunities to get the equaliser, but couldn’t unfortunately. The first half was not as good, especially after the first goal and we couldn’t afford to concede the second.” Perhaps disconcertingly, Frank added: “We will definitely do everything we can to play two good halves.”Whether they were scared, demoralised or simply disengaged, Frank’s charges lacked assertiveness from the start. Nominally pressing their opponents high, it was all done at an arm’s remove, with barely a challenge made. Unlikely to win their duels against a snarling Villa side on the best of days, Spurs did not even try. Unai Emery’s men did not require an invitation to stomp all over their hosts and duly did so.View image in fullscreenMorgan Rogers points in delight after doubling Aston Villa’s lead.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersCharlton v Chelsea: FA Cup third round – liveRead moreWhen Villa opened the scoring, Boubacar Kamara had already been substituted after injuring his ankleafter a Palhinha challenge. Youri Tielemans came on and Villa’s mechanics continued to run smoothly. The Belgian played one of the three consecutive through balls that carved Tottenham open in the 22nd minute, but Donyell Malan applied the twist: flicking the ball into the path of Buendía who slammed a shot past Guglielmo Vicario. It was Buendía’s second goal against Spurs this season after deciding the Premier League fixture in October.Conceding didn’t change Tottenham’s outlook any. They had one moment of promise, from Xavi Simons, as he attempted to do by himself what Villa had achieved as a team, only for Randal Kolo Muani to be ruled offside after he finished Simons’s final ball. The rest was continued submission, and the loss of Richarlison once again to injury. The travelling fans regaled the stadium with rounds of “Tom Frank … is an Arsenal fan” in reference to the past week’s ‘cup gate’ and then, as five minutes of added time were about to be up, things got worse. Villa breezed their way into the Spurs box and a Buendía backheel found Rogers, the Villa talisman gobbling up the chance left-footed.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank shows his frustration during Tottenham’s FA Cup defeat.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images“To play like we did in first half was really fantastic, stopping them dominating with the ball, getting attacking threat in their third and scoring two goals,” Emery said. “I think we deserved to get this win. This club has won this trophy seven times and 9,000 supporters came with us today because they want to watch the team play to win. This is the responsibility we fight for.”After boos loud enough to be heard on the Seven Sisters road, Spurs returned early for the second half with a flea in their ear. Suddenly there was energy and endeavour, if not any clear patterns of play, and within 10 minutes they had a goal back,Odobert driving a low shot across the sprawling Marco Bizot for his first goal of the season, earning a roar from the Tottenham crowd.To be fair to Spurs they kept that endeavour up for another 15 minutes or so before Emery refreshed his troops and slowly sucked the energy out of any comeback. Tottenham fans had the brief succour of seeing Dominic Solanke make an appearance off the bench, his first minutes since the2-0 victory over Manchester Cityin August. But an equaliser never looked likely and, as the clock ran out, the crowd went quiet, saving their energy for a final chorus of catcalls.Explore more on these topicsFA CupTottenham HotspurAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Rayan Cherki’s pirouette presaged him threading the ball in behind Exeter’s defence for the wideman to run in and beat Joe Whitworth to cap a memorable display. A little later Semenyo was replaced to an ovation and, from his seat in the stands, the suspended Pep Guardiola, in a flat cap and winter coat, approved, too.Macclesfield pull off FA Cup’s greatest shock by knocking out holders Crystal PalaceRead moreTijjani Reijnders’ curled finish, Nico O’Reilly’s flicked header, an 18-yard shot by another debutant, Ryan McAidoo, and Rico Lewis’s second completed City’s goal-plunder, while the substitute George Birch, 19, smashed home a memorable first Exeter goal for their consolation.Pep Lijnders, who replaced Guardiola on the touchline, said: “Antoine is settling well, he’s a humble guy. He brings something to the front line, what we really need. He can attack quickly, wants to chase, he’s a guy who doesn’t stop. You see today that he can adapt quite quickly to our style.”City are at Newcastle for Tuesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg. “We want to reach the finals this year,” said Lijnders. “We play the semi-final for the League Cup. We go a round further in theFA Cupand are in the Champions League in a good position.”Lijnders was asked if Guardiola relayed instructions from his vantage point. “What do you think?” he said.As he sought, at the fourth attempt, to win a first game of 2026, Guardiola sent out an XI that included Rodri, Erling Haaland, Cherki, Nathan Aké and the two debutants: the right-back, McAidoo, 17, and the £62.5m man, Semenyo, who operated on the left.View image in fullscreenMax Alleyne (second left) watches his shot give Manchester City the lead.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAExeter, 14th in League One and unbeaten in their past three games, had never faced City in their 125-year history. They started like a train – Jayden Wareham roved in, shot, and James Trafford tipped over for a corner. This came in from the right and Trafford’s reflexes again saved City, the goalkeeper palming Liam Oakes’s header away.Lijnders had a smirk for Gary Caldwell when Exeter’s manager complained to the fourth official, Sam Mulhall, about a corner claimed by Lewis. The Dutchman was far happier when Max Alleyne prodded the opener home. McAidoo, a bright presence, scooped in a cross. Near goal, Aké headed to Haaland, he tapped the ball to Abdukodir Khusanov, who rolled it across, Jack Fitzwater hashed the clearance and the 20-year-old Alleyne, on his second City appearance, scored.Caldwell deployed a 5-4-1 that had to prosper from scant possession. After Wareham nicked the ball near halfway, play went right then left, but Jack Aitchison was flagged offside.Semenyo took out a page advert in the local newspaper to thank Bournemouth fans after his three years there, which was as classy as the raking pass that allowed Reijnders to bob and weave in the Grecians’ area. The 26-year-old’s next contribution was an inadvertent assist. His effort cannoned back to Rodri and the Spaniard fired a missile beyond the diving and helpless Whitworth, low into the keeper’s right corner.Already Exeter were a raggedy bunch, chasing blue shirts about as if dazed and befuddled. Semenyo hit an instant pass to Haaland, he shot, Whitworth parried the ball across the area and Cherki’s dummy was bought by Luca Woodhouse, who felled the Frenchman. Adam Herczeg ruled no penalty, which appeared a wrong decision, but with no video assistant referee the decision was final.By half-time City led 4-0. The hapless Fitzwater headed Cherki’s corner from the left against Aké and the ball bounced in. Then Reijnders’ cross from the left was turned past Whitworth by Fitzwater, whose afternoon was becoming a nightmare.View image in fullscreenGeorge Birch scores for Exeter, making it 9-1 – but Rico Lewis had the last word.Photograph: Peter Powell/ReutersBefore this, Ilmari Niskanen broke through from right wing-back but steered his effort wide, so Exeter wandered off for the interval staring at a serious hiding.Haaland, Aké and Rodri were replaced by Divine Mukasa, Stephen Mfuni and O’Reilly, and City continued on. Semenyo this time curved a cross over from the left and Lewis’s volley gave Whitworth no chance.Further City goals came for Semenyo, Reijnders, O’Reilly, McAidoo and, after Birch’s, Lewis, as Exeter were imperiously swatted aside by Guardiola’s ruthless unit. Caldwell said: “When the team sheet came in, it was an experience we didn’t envisage.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupManchester CityExeter Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We’ve got a good bunch in there.“We’ve got a long trip home – five and a half hours – but, man, they should be proud of themselves even though we’re sick as pigs.”The team from the seaside town in Somerset had never previously reached theFA Cupthird round in their 139-year existence so this 500-mile round trip to Lincolnshire marked the biggest match in the club’s history.Their side comprises of a painter and decorator, supermarket project manager, teaching assistant, university lecturer, builder, physiotherapist and car salesman.For Grimsby, however, there is a place in the fourth round of this famous old competition, and that will have the locals dreaming of another giantkilling ahead of Monday’s draw.Artell said: “Weston deserve a huge amount of credit for how they played, as do their fans who never shut up all game.Macclesfield pull off FA Cup’s greatest shock by knocking out holders Crystal PalaceRead more“But we still found a way to win and that’s what knockout football is all about. We know what it’s like when the boot’s been on the other foot. We’ve got dreams as well and it would be good to get another tie at home or a big fish away.”Having memorablydumped Manchester United out of the Carabao Cupon penalties in the second-round stage at Blundell Park, Artell’s men won 1-0 at Sheffield Wednesday before beingbeaten 5-0 at home by Brentford.The League Cup will never compare to the FA Cup but that raw fervour, that unifying sense of togetherness which an unexpected cup run creates, remains one of the most magical sights and sounds in the English game.Weston could testify to that, with the visitors having arrived here as the joint lowest-ranked team left in the competition with National League North side Macclesfield.They train twice a week, usually on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and despite falling just short, Weston’s Cup run has generated about £150,000 for a club with a mid-table budget for their division.On a bitterly cold evening, both sides soon warmed to their task and, while Grimsby generally enjoyed the upper hand, Weston were far from overawed.But four minutes before the break, Charles Vernam collected possession from a short corner and fired a superb dipping shot over Max Harris to put Grimsby ahead.Goodness knows what Rogers said to his men at half-time but they came out with a renewed belief and were soon level when Coulson’s 25-yard free-kick took a huge deflection and flew into the net.View image in fullscreenGrimsby’s mascot leads the teams out of the tunnel.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesChances began to proliferate at both ends and Grimsby restored their advantage when substitute Jaze Kabia’s effort beat Harris after good work by Cameron McJannet.Still Weston were not finished and, when a free-kick dropped across the face of Grimsby’s goal in the 77th minute, the predatory Britton was there to fire home right-footed from six yards.It was his sixth FA Cup goal this season but, with just four minutes remaining, a corner came in and Green’s astute header sailed into Weston’s net, breaking the hearts of Rogers, his players and their supporters.Artell added: “ We said during the League Cup run that we wanted to put the club on the map and we’re trying to do that. We’re still in the fourth tier but we’ve got a town who are proud of their football club.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupGrimsbyWeston-super-Marematch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Egyptians had little possession at the Grande Stade Agadir but took their chances with clinical precision and held on to book a semi-final with Senegal on Wednesday.An own goal from Ahmed Fatouh and a late effort by Guéla Doué proved insufficient for Côte d’Ivoire, winners of the tournament on home soil two years ago but now deposed as African champions.Morocco sail into Afcon semi-finals as Díaz sparks fine win over CameroonRead moreEgypt, who have won a record seven titles, wasted little time in taking the lead as Marmoush scored in the fourth minute after Hamdi Fathy won the ball from Franck Kessie in the midfield, allowing Emam Ashour to thread a pinpoint pass to the sprinting Marmoush. He still needed to shrug off the attentions of defender Odilon Kossounou before slotting home.It quickly became clear the Ivorians were going to dominate possession, showing much more physical strength on the ball but without setting up clear chances. Egypt went 2-0 up in the 32nd minute when Rabia rose above the defenders to head his side further ahead from a corner. Côte d’Ivoire reduced the deficit eight minutes later when teenager Yann Diomande’s free-kick near the corner took a slight brush off Kossounou’s head and ricocheted off the knee of full back Fatouh and into the net.The Ivorians had come from 2-0 down to beat Gabon 3-2 earlier in the tournament but hopes of turning the scoreline around soon after the restart were stymied by a simply created, but superbly finished, goal for Salah seven minutes after the break. Rabia was well inside his own half when he chipped the ball over the top of the Ivorian defensive line, allowing Ashour to run on to it and hit an accurate pass with the outside of his right boot into the path of Salah to score.An Ivorian comeback was still on when Doué touched home at the end of a goalmouth scramble in the 73rd minute. That set up a siege of the Egyptian goal in the final 15 minutes but they held out to advance.Nigeria, who have reached the last four 17 times in the last 20 tournaments they have qualified for, will take on Morocco in Rabat in the semi-finals on Wednesday after their win over Algeria.Osimhen steered home a long cross from the left by Bruno Onyemaechi two minutes into the second half as Algeria’s goalkeeper Luca Zidane made a bizarre jump to try to stop the effort but ended up getting his angles wrong and conceding an easy goal.Adams increased Nigeria’s lead 10 minutes later as Osimhen unselfishly fed him the ball and he took it round Zidane before placing it into an empty net. It was an impressive performance by Nigeria, who missed out on World Cup qualification two months ago, as they overwhelmed their opponents from the start at the Grand Stade de Marrakech. Nigeria looked more determined, quicker around the field and stronger in the challenges, denying their opponents a single scoring chance.Algeria had been forced to play extra time before winning their last-16 clash against the Democratic Republic of Congo on Tuesday and the exertion could have been the reason many of their key players turned in listless performances. In contrast, Nigeria had a comfortable 4-0 win over Mozambique on Monday.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Nigeria football teamAlgeria football teamEgypt football teamCôte d’Ivoire football teamAfrica Cup of NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

I am genuinely mortified and apologise unreservedly to everyone offended, and will be donating my fee from today's show to the Holocaust Educational Trust.\"Final Score presenter Jason Mohammad apologised later in the show for the \"inappropriate language\" used.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.O’Neill pointed out the importance of a goal-saving block from Liam Scales on Owen Stirton and also admitted his concern that Julián Araujo might have received a red card for a late tackle on Will Ferry. “If the confidence is kind of fragile, then that sort of thing can change again, then it gives the opposition a big boost,” he said. “But we rode that one out and we saw it through.”Celtic are yet to make a January signing after failing to meet their objectives in the previous two transfer windows. “I am hopeful we are going to get some people in,” O’Neill said. “But just when you think that something might happen, things change around. We obviously need to do it, even just to give help to the boys. If we pick up injuries to really key players we could be in serious trouble.”Celtic’s Nancy catastrophe is another indicator of a club embroiled in turmoil | Ewan MurrayRead moreKieron Bowie earnedHiberniana point in a 1-1 draw withMotherwell.

We talked a lot and openly about her future, and when she told us that she now wanted to try something new, her reasons were completely understandable.”Stanway posted on social media that she had made lifelong friends at the German club and told the club: “I will give everything for the club and its sporting success until my very last day, just as I have for the past three and a half years. And I want to say goodbye to the club and the fans at the end of the season with as many titles as possible.”Aston Villa are set to sign the France midfielder Oriane Jean-François from Chelsea for £450,000 in a club-record fee for a sale by the London side. It is understood that the deal is agreed and the 24-year-old’s move should be finalised in the coming days.

You cannot tell a story without in some way editing it, reducing it, compressing it. Which means that anybody telling a story about a historical event, particularly one from the relatively recent past, risks outraging those who have studied it or who remember it. Often those complaints are pedantic, trivial, but sometimes they are not. It’s one thing to elide two minor characters or to tweak the timeline to simplify a story, quite another to imply misleading motivations.Saipan, Glenn Leyburn’s and Lisa Barros D’Sa’s film about the cataclysmic row between Roy Keane and Mick McCarthy shortly before the 2002 World Cup, came out in Ireland on Boxing Day and will be released in the UK on 23 January. It is obsessed by detail: the tracksuits, the sweatshirts, the kits are all right. It’s startling when the film cuts between reproductions of interviews and press conferences and actual footage to realise just how accurately these scenes have been recreated. Which raises two questions. What is the point? And how can such care have been taken over the look of the film when there are such grotesque inventions and inaccuracies in the plotting and motivation?Fra Filippo Lippi was a 15-century Florentine painter noted for the realism of his depictions of religious scenes. Go to the Uffizi and compare, for instance, hisMadonna with Child and Two Angelswith the work around it and you can see why he had such an impact. There is a delicacy and a precision, a spontaneity and humanity, that set him apart from his contemporaries (and his son). It’s that realism Robert Browning picks up on in his dramatic monologue in which he imagines Lippi arguing with a critic who objects: “Nature is complete:/Suppose you reproduce her – (which you can’t)/There’s no advantage! you must beat her, then.” Browning’s Lippi replies: “We’re made so that we love/First when we see them painted, things we have passed/Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see,” and concludes: “Art was given for that.”And perhaps in painting, or sculpture or even literature, that is true. Part of the joy of great art is that it highlights the beauty of the everyday. But there is also pleasure to be taken from the technical skill required in mimetic reproduction. Lippi’s work is lighter, less formulaic, more alive than that of his contemporaries. Which is where photography presented a challenge to painting.John William Inchbold’s mid-19th-century depictions of woodland scenes are startling in their detail and the subtlety of the lighting but, inevitably, they’re less realistic than a snap a child could take on their phone. And that in part explains the move, later in the century, with the Impressionists and their successors, towards something less realistic, something that tries to capture an inner spirit, an energy, or the movement of light.View image in fullscreenMick McCarthy (right) and Roy Keane during  a Republic of Ireland training session in Saipan.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PAFilm is perhaps now facing a similar challenge. Just as realist painters delighted in reflecting back the world, so it makes sense for filmmakers to depict great historical scenes: here is Julius Caesar being stabbed in the forum, here is Alexander Nevsky leading his troops across the frozen Lake Chudskoe. Here is Winston Churchill delivering a rousing address to the Commons. But that seems a little less necessary when the event being depicted was filmed at the time.And it seems a particularly odd exercise when the event being depicted was specifically staged for the cameras. What do we gain by seeing Steve Coogan doing an impression of McCarthy in a post-match press conference when the press conference was filmed and the footage exists? The only logic is to maintain continuity for the scenes for which we don’t have footage, of which the most important in Saipan is, of course, the climactic “stick it up your bollocks” tirade in the hotel restaurant. But that scene is itself problematic.Accounts of exactly what was said vary but everybody who was there agrees that Keane did not attack McCarthy for being insufficiently Irish, as he does in the film. The two players who went to Keane afterwards in sympathy, Gary Breen and David Connolly, were born in England (as were nine others in that squad). To set this up as some sort of Anglo-Irish dispute is untrue, misleading and, frankly, lazy.Coogan’s portrayal of McCarthy is generally fine, even if there is an alarming moment when it seems as if Jimmy Savile is celebrating an Ireland goal.Éanna Hardwicke is excellent as Keane. But when this was filmed, Coogan was 16 years older than McCarthy was in Saipan. He is also three inches shorter than Hardwicke, whereas McCarthy is three inches taller than Keane. That changes the dynamic significantly. Rather than a man of 30 shouting at a physically imposing man one generation older, the scene in the restaurant becomes a young, hyper-fit, extremely intense athlete berating a shorter man nearly 30 years his senior. And whatever the merits of his argument, that just looks like bullying.Perhaps that’s primarily an aesthetic concern, the quibble of a journalist who has spent significant time in the presence of McCarthy and Keane. But it’s fundamental, because it calls into question the whole point of the exercise. Why is this a drama rather than a documentary? What, other than an uneven tone, is gained by the dramatised scenes?We see McCarthy doing odd jobs at home. We hear an expletive-laden phone call with Alex Ferguson. We witness almost cartoonish shenanigans at the training camp: the Football Association of Ireland executives and the majority of the players portrayed as perennially drunk. But that broad-brush, exaggerated comedy sits awkwardly alongside the more nuanced portrayal of Keane – not that it is nuanced enough to begin to penetrate what drives him. In the world of the film, his fury at the unprofessional shambles he has to deal with is the only reasonable response; the reality was far less straightforward.View image in fullscreenRoy Keane, as portrayed by Éanna Hardwicke, is the centre of attention in Saipan.Photograph: Aidan Monaghan/PAShifting Keane’s rant about the fact that Ireland are refuelling not with pasta and salad but cheese sandwiches from the qualifier against the Netherlands to Saipan is justifiable. It’s a good story and it exemplifies his concerns. Other changes, though, are less justifiable. Keane’s explosive interview with the Irish Times is depicted as a betrayal, a journalist printing the story not after the tournament as agreed but the day before they left Saipan for Japan. That simply isn’t true, and lessens Keane’s culpability.The most engaging moments of Saipan are the contemporary clips. In part it’s the texture that provides: the familiar voices ofBill O’Herlihy, Eamon Dunphy and Tony O’Donoghue, RTÉ’s evident excitement at speaking via a sat-phone despite the dreadful picture quality, and the sadness and bitterness in the phone-ins: this really was a subject that split the nation. The problem is that, other than one montage that briefly references the booming Irish economy, there is no real indication as to why the issue was so divisive, the way in which Keane was perceived by many as representing the new thrusting Ireland of the Celtic Tiger and McCarthy the lovable but shambolic past. This wasn’t just about an angry man shouting at an old bloke; it was about Ireland.Perhaps achieving that in drama is difficult, particularly given it’s not an uncomplicated issue: Keane is not simply some avatar of “progress”. You don’t want Steven Reid and Jason McAteer – two of the handful of named other players in the film; neither come out of it well – discussing the state of the nation as they lounge by the pool. The faithfulness of the recreations are admirable but, by the end, those scenes feel almost an aesthetic experiment in the manner of Gus Van Sant’s scene-by-scene remake of Psycho.And so you end up, like Browning’s imagined critic of Lippi, muttering about the futility of mimetic reproduction. This is not like seeing a doting mother and baby in the street, then marvelling at how accurately that has been reproduced in paint on canvas in a gallery. This is seeing something that happened on film, that for the vast majority of people was first experienced on a screen, reproduced in film on a screen.This is not like Frost/Nixon, The Damned United or even Coogan’s turn as Brian Walden in Brian and Maggie, each of which features the reproduction of a key interview, because in each of those examples, the interview is part of a greater whole. Here, beyond stick-it-up-your-bollocks, there isn’t much else – and what there is takes some highly questionable liberties with what actually happened. And where there are conflicting views, better surely to present both than to offer the consolation of a simple dramatised narrative that is not merely not true, but is rather less interesting than the reality.Explore more on these topicsRepublic of IrelandInside footballRoy KeaneMick McCarthyWorld Cup 2002commentShareReuse this content"

The sides’ first ever meeting in this competition offered Tonda Eckert’s stumblingSouthamptonthe ideal chance to get back to winning ways after their recent Championship problems.The away side seemed set to cruise through after Cameron Bragg, Cameron Archer and Kuryu Matsuki scored first-half goals against the side 23rd in League One, only for Doncaster to expose familiar frailties. Grant McCann’s men, who also came into this without a win in six games, pulled back two goals through Matty Pearson and Jordan Gibson as visitors wobbled early in the second half. However, debutant Daniel Peretz’s double save in stoppage time helped Southampton avoid embarrassment.Jaden Philogene and Jacob Greaves scored asIpswichbeatBlackpool2-1.

Despite there being 40 places between the sides, League Two Cambridge might have fancied their chances beforehand after suffering only one home defeat this season. But they were two down at the break thanks to Kai Wagner’s deflected effort, his first goal since signing from Philadelphia Union, and Kyogo Furuhashi’s clinical finish.The third goal came 11 minutes from the end as the hosts gave possession away and Tommy Doyle fed Marvin Ducksch, who rolled the ball into the far corner. Cambridge responded immediately as Louis Appéré’s determined play helped work the ball to substitute Sullay Kaikai, who also found the far corner with a precise finish.

Women were shown tied up, gagged and shot.The technology secretary, Liz Kendall, said on Friday that ministers were looking seriously at the possibility of access toXbeing barred in the UK.View image in fullscreenLiz Kendall said ministers were looking seriously at possibility of access to X being barred in the UK.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesShe said she expectedOfcom, which said this week that it was seeking urgent answers from the platform, to announce action within “days not weeks”.“X needs to get a grip and get this material down,” she said. “And I would remind them that in the Online Safety Act, there are backstop powers to block access to services if they refuse to comply with the law for people in the UK. And if Ofcom decides to use those powers, they would have the full backing of the government.”The UK government’s concerns were echoed by the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese. Speaking in Canberra on Saturday, Albanese said that “global citizens deserve better”. Australia recently banned the use of social media for under-16s.View image in fullscreenAnthony Albanese.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP“The use of generative artificial intelligence to exploit or sexualise people without their consent is abhorrent,” he said.“The fact that this tool was used so that people were using its image creation function through Grok is just completely abhorrent. It, once again, is an example of social media not showing social responsibility.”Elon Musk’s X threatened with UK ban over wave of indecent AI imagesRead moreSome rightwing political figures have tried to frame this as a free speech issue. Responding to the news X faced a potential ban, the former prime minister Liz Truss said: “Starmer is really losing it now.”X partially restricted access to Grok on Friday. Its public account lost the ability to generate images at the request of free users, leaving the function available only to paid subscribers. It also appeared to have stopped creating bikini images.The Grok app, however, which does not generate images publicly, is still able to create sexually explicit material from women’s pictures.Other nudificiation apps are still available. The Labour MP Jess Asato, who campaigns against the sexual abuse and harassment of women, said legislation to ban such apps was urgently needed.She posted on social media: “It’s not just XAi.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.YouTube influencer Nick Shirley, whose viral video alleging fraud by daycare centers servicingMinneapolis’sSomali American community came days ahead of the Trump administration’s declaration ofa national funding freeze, has for years published conspiracy-minded takes on hot-button rightwing issues.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.He also has close ties to the White House,Republicans, and to representatives of an earlier generation of rightwing partisan “ambush journalists” such asJames O’Keefe. He worked with Minnesota Republicans to produce the viral video on Somali-run daycares.Shirley has collaborated closely with his mother and fellow influencer Brooke Shirley, with the pair traveling together to flashpoints elevated by rightwing discourse online and in conservative media, and publishing across platforms including TikTok andYouTube.Their US destinations have included the southern border,Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, but they have also traveled overseas for big-ticket rightwing and anti-immigrant events including the Tommy Robinson-organized “Unite the Kingdom” rally last September.Shirley’s videos frequently sensationalize conflict, or focus on street violence. The titles of recent videos includeDearborn Michigan has Fallen… Christians and Muslims Battle,Portland has Fallen… ANTIFA has Taken Control of City, andI Confronted Dangerous Migrant Scammers in NYC | Canal Street, the latter of which highlights a physical confrontation between Shirley and a street vendor in New York.Shirley’s 26 December video, which targeted Minnesota’s Somali community with allegations of widespread fraud,became the basisfor a torrent of anti-immigrant and anti-Somali content across social media, including in Truth Social posts by Donald Trump.Follow-up reporting by local outlets includingCBS Minnesotaand theMinnesota Star-Tribune, has found little factual basis for Shirley’s claims that daycare centers were claiming federal funding without caring for any children.More than 90 people in Minnesotahave been charged since 2022 in a $250m Covid-19 relief fraud scheme involving a non-profit that falsely claimed to provide meals to children, and a federal prosecutor estimated that $9bn or more in federal funds across 14 state programs may have been stolen since 2018.Butno fraud charges have been filed against the daycare centers featured by Shirley, though state records show some had code violations unrelated to fraudShirley’s latest video was the culmination of a years-long, peripatetic effort by the mother-and-son pairing to entrench themselves at the head of a burgeoning milieu of Maga-verse content creators.Brooke Shirley, 55, has posted hundreds of videos to her TikTok account beginning just two weeks after the January 6 protests at the United States Capitol, which Nick Shirleyfilmed himself attending.She has also publicly defended the veracity of her son’s work. InNovember she told the Columbia Journalism Review(CJR) that “what Nick is doing is journalism”, adding: “He’s documenting what is going on in America and in the world. And independent journalists are the ones that are out there.”They also have a shared self-perception as truth-telling citizen journalists.The Guardian contacted Brooke Shirley for comment via voice and text message on a cellphone number identified as an active connection in her name by several data brokers. Nick Shirley was contacted for comment via the contact email listed on his YouTube page, and which he has invited people to send tips on in the description field of his videos.Neither responded.Petros Iosifidos, professor of media and communications policy at City St George’s, University of London, and the co-author of the 2021 bookDigital Democracy, Social Media and Disinformation, said: “Such a usage of social media does not aid democratic representation and instead contributes to a greater destabilisation of modern politics.He added, “The situation has worsened in more recent years with widespread mis/disinformation that deprives the public of their fundamental right to have access to reliable, accurate information so to make informed decisions.”Nick Shirley’s very good yearNick Shirley has emerged in the last two years as one of a new crop of news influencers who achieved a new level of salience at the tail end of the Biden years and have been actively cultivated by Trump’s White House.Shirley wasone of the inviteesto a White HouseAntifa roundtablein October, at which influencers and administration officials aired their grievances about the amorphous social movement that has served as a Maga target since Trump’s first presidency.Shirley dutifullyposted a video of his speech at the eventon his YouTube channel.By then, Shirley was riding high on the basis of a previous viral yarn, after he wasone of the first influencersto post alarmist videos about immigrant vendors on New York’s Canal Street.Reportedly, the attention from Shirley and other news influencers such as Savanah Hernandez led to an Ice sweep of the vendors, which was met by resistance from New York residents, and earned a rebuke from Zohran Mamdani, then a mayoral candidate, who called the tactics “aggressive and reckless”.One media reportquoted a resident of the Chinatown district where the vendors have been located for decades as saying that Ice “just take advantage of this because suddenly the rightwing media and online influencers came down into the area”.In November, Shirley wasawardedthe “citizen journalist of the year” at the Citizen Journalism Gala heldat Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, andhosted byJames O’Keefe.The month after the Mar-a-Lago ceremony, Shirley was collaborating with MinnesotaRepublicansto put the issue of purported fraud in the state’s Somali immigrant community on the national agenda.On 29 December, House Republican leaders held a press conference in the wake of his videos.At that conference, Lisa DeMuth not only backed the veracity of the video, telling reporters: “By now, everyone has seen the viral video that in under an hour exposed more than a million dollars in fraud.”She also added: “Our caucus has been working to expose fraud for years, including working with Nick Shirley and agency whistleblowers to get the information out to the public and to hold the Walz administration accountable.”The Guardian emailed DeMuth to ask for specifics on the collaboration, and whether theapparentinaccuraciesunveiledby subsequent reporting were Shirley’s alone, or as a result of information provided by the caucus.A spokesperson referred to a man who appears prominently in the video, referred to only as “David” by Shirley, but who waslater identified by the Minnesota Star-Tribuneas David Hoch, a Minnesotan whose several paid political campaigns included an incident in which he campaigned “in nothing but shorts and a sandwich board on Minneapolis’ Nicollet Mall”.They wrote: “Some of the information they used, including daycare locations, CCAP numbers, violations, etc, was given to David by caucus staff who found it in the official DHS licensing database and other publicly available sources.”Double actShirleyreportedlybuilt his channel with shock and prank videos in the late teens, while he was still a high school student. After graduating in 2020, Shirley, a Mormon, took a hiatus during 2021 and 2022 while he completed a religiously ordained mission.After he returned from his mission in 2023, according to NPR, Shirley’s content took on a more sharply political and partisan character.Per Columbia Journalism Review reporting, this pivot wasencouraged by Brooke: “It was Brooke – who was a former journalism student and a content creator herself – who pushed her son to cover the southern border,” the topic of several Nick Shirley videos in 2023.Brooke Shirley not only encouraged her son to make such content, but arguably led the way for him, having published pro-Maga content to TikTok since late January 2021, according to a Guardian review of the account.She has also been closely involved in his work. In his acceptance speech at Mar-a-Lago, according to CJR, he thanked Brooke “for filming many of his videos”.Each has registered companies that appear to be related to their public output.According to Utah company records, Shirley was the organizer of Honey Badger LLC, whose purpose was “online media and related activities”, which was registered in April 2024 and administratively dissolved on 21 September 2025. Brooke Shirley, meanwhile, is the organizer of BT Outlook LLC, whose purpose is “social media and related activities”, which was incorporated on 30 September 2024.Both companies were registered at the same residential address in suburban Farmington, Utah. It’s not known if BT Outlook LLC is the underlying entity for the pair’s news influencer activities.While Nick Shirley promotes his YouTube channel as being “here to entertain and bring the truth to all”, on Brooke’s TikTok account, which at the time of reporting had more than 290,000 followers, Brooke describes herself as a “boots on the ground Citizen Journalist!”, adding, “follow me for true news!”.Roving reportersBrooke’s boots frequently tread the same ground as Nick’s.The pair’s video output indicates that they travel to the same places that have been the focus of conservative media and social media, and produce often-inflammatory content that reinforces conspiracy narratives about locales, individuals and groups that have been demonized in rightwing discourse.Nick Shirley’s videos are usually longer, more complex, and more intensively edited than his mother’s, but the pair often cover the same ground.On 28 October, for example, Nick Shirleypublished a videoon YouTube which purported to offer an account of events on the ground in Portland, Oregon. His video played up stereotypes of the city which have emerged during the Trump era, focusing on homeless encampments, and scuffles outside the city’s ICE facility, which has been a focus for protesters and counter-protesters since the summer, and attracted a Trump-ordered national guard deployment, which has since ended after the supreme court judged it unconstitutional.In a section of the video Shirley entitled “ANTIFA receives a new shipment”, Shirley showed a U-Haul truck resupplying protesters with barbecue ingredients and inflatable animal costumes.Between 12 and 16 October, Brooke Shirley published five TikTok videos shot in the city. Inone published on 17 October, Shirley features footage of the same costumes, groceries and charcoal grills highlighted by Nick in his longer YouTube video.In the video, which features throughout a text insert reading “Antifa camp receives gear in Portland”, Brooke Shirley intones over footage of the set-up outside the ICE facility: “I’m in Portland,Oregon, and I’m going to show you what the ICE facility looks like,” adding: “Right over there you can get inflatables to put on. There’s food to eat. There’s tents to take a nap in, I guess.”Another of Brooke Shirley’s Portland videos published on 15 October isfocused on protesters wearing Tyrannosaurus rex costumes.In that video, over footage of the blow-up theropods dancing with other protesters, Shirley asked viewers to “imagine if for 100 days this has been going on in front of your apartment complex. Because this has been going on for more than 100 days, 24/7”.The same pattern repeats itself in the pair’s trips throughout the US and beyond to cover hot-button rightwing issues and events.On 15 September, Nick Shirley posted video taken at the anti-immigrant Unite the Kingdom rally in London held two days earlier, where interviewees included awoman in a Union Jack bikini, and a man withsevere facial contusionswho was later seenconfronting police officers.The video alsoheavily featuredthe far-right activist andconvicted criminalStephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, who was one of the rally’s key organizers.Shirley published aseparate sit-down interviewwith Robinson.Around the rally, Brooke Shirley published interviews with attenders who offered praise forDonald Trumpand the recently assassinatedCharlie Kirk. The previous year, on a separate trip, Brooke Shirley publishedher own interview with Tommy Robinson.‘The Somalians are masters at fraud’Following established practice, Brooke Shirley posted versions of theMinnesotastory to her TikTok channel.On 27 December, sheposted a videocaptioned “The Somalians are masters at fraud and the government is dumb enough to allow it to continue to go on it. It’s easy to find the fraud. All you need to do is a little bit of research and visit the businesses. #minnesota #minneapolis”.A text insert on the video, which shows Brooke Shirley standing outside a purportedly empty ABC Learning daycare center inMinneapolis, reads: “Somalian-run Daycares all over Minnesota are closed yet collecting millions every year from the government.”In the video, Brooke Shirley says: “This daycare right here, ran by Somalians, has taken in from the Minnesota government $1.1m.”Shirley adds: “This daycare says it can hold up to 40 children. I went up to the door. The door is locked, and as you can see, the windows are blacked out. I can’t hear any children inside this daycare.”Shirley continues: “It’s midday right now. You’d think there’d be children in there playing, being taught, but no one is in there.”Further on, she asserts: “The Somalians are robbing the taxpayers in Minnesota blind.”Nick Shirley’s identical claims about ABC Learning Center have been refuted by multiple outlets, including CBS Minnesota, who found timestamped security footage of children arriving on the day they visited the facility, with reporters seeing children being cared for when they visited.Brooke Shirley’s video had been viewed almost 360,000 times at the time of reporting.In the past, Brooke Shirley has credited her son for her success on TikTok.On 18 January 2025, following a brief TikTok shutdown arising from Biden-era legislation aimed at forcing the site’s Chinese parent company to divest, Shirley posted a video whose caption explicitly credited her son for her success on the platform.“I am saying goodbye for a moment hopefully we will be back! Thank you my TikTok family and friends!” Shirley wrote, adding “Thank you to my amazing son @Nick Shirley for making my dreams come true here on TikTok!!”Theaccompanying video, soundtracked by Green Day’s Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), featured a montage of still images of Shirley interviewing migrants at the southern border and cities around the country, attending Trump rallies and student protests, and standing outside homeless encampments.Despite persistent concerns about the quality of the information passed on by self-described “citizen journalists” like Shirley,Pew research suggeststhat one in five Americans regularly get news from social media content creators.Explore more on these topicsYouTubeMinneapolisMinnesotaOregonPortlandWest CoastRepublicansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fears of an “AI bubble” have been voiced by people from thegovernor of the Bank of Englandto thehead of Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Even if you have not actively invested in technology shares, the chances are you have some exposure to companies operating in the sphere. Even if you do not, a collapse could take down other companies’ values.So should you be worried about an AI bubble? And what can you do to protect yourself? Here are five things you need to know.Bubbles are hard to predictYou never know if there has been a bubble until after the event, says Daniel Casali, the chief investment strategist at the wealth management company Evelyn Partners, and if Guardian Money could predict the peaks and troughs in the stock market you would be the first to know (shortly before we all cashed in and retired).Some commentators suggest investors are currently paying too much for technology stocks because of misplaced expectations about how much the companies will make from developments in AI.However, others argue that this is not the case. Bankers at UBS, for example, had positive predictions for AI in their year ahead report. Acknowledging risks in the sector, they pointed to the capacity for much more spending on the technology. This could underpin further gains for AI-linked shares in 2026, they said.Even if these companies do turn out to be overvalued, it could take time for that to play out. At the moment AI technology is developing quickly, and for every setback there could be another breakthrough.It is unwise to make decisions based purely on an assumption that a bubble is about to burst.View image in fullscreenFears of an AI bubble have been voiced by people from the governor of the Bank of England to the head of Google’s parent company, Alphabet.Photograph: Christian Ohde/AlamyA collapse could affect you“If the bubble is in AI then it does not stop there with the sell-off – all other boats will start to sink as well,” Casali says. “You start to get contagion. A sell-off in AI will affect everything.”If there is a collapse it seems obvious that the value of companies that had promised future profits would come from using AI would take a hit. For those unconnected to the industry it’s about confidence. “Confidence is everything,” Casali says. “If investors lose confidence then so do businesses and consumers.”A global stock market crash could have an impact on your job, on the banking sector – in December the Bank of Englandwarned of risks to financial stability– and on the wider economy. Any investments you have in stocks and shares, held directly or through your Isa or pension that you might not keep close tabs on, could fall in value.View image in fullscreenDo you have any investments in stocks and shares held through an Isa?Photograph: Leonora Oates/AlamyTechnology stocks are likely to fall furthest and you may have money in them without knowing it. Dan Coatsworth, the head of markets at the investment platform AJ Bell, says: “Some people might think the key to not having too much exposure to US-listed AI stocks is to go with a global equity tracker fund. What they might not realise is that the US is full of tech names, and the geography accounts for a large chunk of the global market, such as 72% of the MSCI World index.”No losses until you cash inThat said, when it comes to pensions or investments you only make a real loss after a stock market fall if you sell the shares.In your planning, and reaction to market gyrations, you should think in terms of years, not weeks or months.“Pensions are the ultimate long-term investment, and it is important not to let speculation or short-term volatility force you into making kneejerk reactions that you may come to regret,” says Helen Morrissey, the head of retirement analysis at the advisers Hargreaves Lansdown.Morrissey says that by making “snap decisions” to stop contributing or change investments you risk crystallising losses and “it can make it harder to build your pension back up when markets recover”.If you are getting close to retirement and saving in a workplace pension, then there is a good chance that your money is invested in something called a lifestyling fund.There is a lot to be said for staying invested through the ups and downs of marketsLCP’s Steve Webb“This aims to protect your pension by moving you out of equities into assets such as bonds the closer you get to retirement, so you may find you are less impacted by market falls than you thought,” Morrissey says. “If you are concerned then you may choose to delay retirement for a while until things get better or speak to a financial adviser about the best approach.”With your Isa this will not happen but, again, in the event of a downturn you will not have real losses unless you withdraw the money.Steve Webb, a partner at the pension consultants LCP, says that for younger people who own shares “there is a lot to be said for staying invested through the ups and downs of markets, on the basis that in the long run you are likely to see your savings grow, and it’s very hard to ‘time the markets’ in any case”.If you are worried about an investment bubble bursting, Tom Francis, the head of personal finance at Octopus Money, says to ask yourself what it is that is making you feel uneasy. “If the answer is that you’ll need this money in the next few years, that’s a clear signal that you might be invested too riskily for such a short timeframe,” he says.“If you don’t need the money any time soon but hate seeing your investments fall in value, that’s just a natural part of investing,” he adds. “Over the long term, markets have tended to perform well and time is usually your biggest ally.”The same is true for gainsWith stock markets near record highs, you may feel it is a good time to cash in investments and lock in any gains.“For those close to retirement, and particularly anyone thinking of using their pension pot to buy an annuity, locking in current high valuations is worth considering,” Webb says. However, he has a word of caution: “Inevitably, there is a risk that you might come out of the market and see values continue to rise.”You need to weigh up whether the financial hit of missing out on further rises is bigger than the potential loss from a crash. Sadly, a financial adviser is unlikely to be able to tell you the best time to cash in, but they should be able to help you put the risks and rewards in context.Diversification is best“If there’s one principle that never goes out of style in investing, it’s diversification,” says Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Spreading investments across different sectors and asset classes remains the simplest and most effective way to guard against surprises.”Francis says you should have an emergency fund of three to six months’ expenses then “diversify your investments rather than betting on one hot stock, and invest for the long term – ideally five years or more. Doing these three things can help you drown out the noise without panicking when markets wobble.”According to Britzman, no investor will be truly immune to a stock market correction caused by an AI bubble bursting: “The tech sector is so intertwined in markets globally that it’s feasible to suggest all assets could wobble in this situation.”With this in mind he says the challenge “is to find ways to make your Isa or pension portfolio fall by less than the broader market, and that means considering lower-risk investments, ones with safe haven qualities like gold, or less glamorous sectors that generate strong cashflows.”Britzman says companies that might prove popular with investors are found in sectors such as insurance, utilities, food producers, household goods and telecoms. “Many will pay dividends, and their earnings are more predictable. Investors are often happy to pay a premium for these types of companies in a market downturn.”View image in fullscreenGold is deemed a safe haven asset.Photograph: Hiba Kola/ReutersCasali says gold has proved a very reliable investment, and there are reasons to believe this will be true in a crash. He adds that short-term government bonds are another asset to consider – these bonds, also known as gilts, are the government’s way of borrowing money and pay a fixed rate of interest to investors.“One- to two-year gilt yields are driven by the Bank of England base rate,” he says. In the event of a crash, the Bank of England is likely to cut interest rates, and that will make the returns on those gilts look good.There are funds that give you access to these assets. One way to hold gold with household names such as Unilever, Visa and Nestlé is to invest in the Trojan Fund, which is available via lots of Isa platforms. The Royal London Short-Term Money Market Fund is an investment that offers access to short-term government bonds.If you want a global tracker fund but want to reduce your exposure to the US tech companies, Coatsworth says another option is a global equity tracker that excludes the US, such as Xtrackers MSCI World ex USA.Explore more on these topicsInvestmentsAI (artificial intelligence)Stock marketsSavingsInvestingTechnology sectorInvestment fundsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But some analysts believe that Venezuela, home to the world’s largest proven reserves, could be pumping millions of additional barrels as early as this year, hitting the global price and squeezing Russia’s income.US sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoillast year and a rise in the rouble, depressing income from oil sales in dollars, have already reduced receipts for Moscow.Optimists argue that after four years of war inUkraine, Putin is increasingly vulnerable because Russia’s financial position is precarious. A fall in oil prices, they say, would have a catastrophic effect on his ability to fund the war and continue grinding down Ukrainian resistance.They portray the Russian economy as a house of cards, ready to collapse if only the right gust of economic pressure could be directed at Moscow.8:31Why has Trump seized a Russian-linked oil tanker? | The LatestEconomic growth, spurred by government military spending, has slowed to almost zero after the Kremlin sought to calm the inflation caused by that same economic expansion. The International Monetary Fundpredicted growth of 0.6% in 2025and 1% in 2026.Interest rates are high at almost 20% and taxes are due to rise again this year. Unemployment has fallen to almost 2%, reflecting a severe labour shortage as young men are drafted into the army amid falling birthrates and an exodus of middle-income families to the west.Household incomes, which have grown in response to higher welfare spending, are now expected to stagnate. A paper by Marek Dabrowski, an analyst at the Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel, says the latest budget cuts have transferred from Moscow to the regions and reduced pension spending, with education also facing cuts. Business leaders complain there is little incentive to invest in such an environment.Some point to Iran, where a combination of sanctions and targeted military strikes has brought the economy to its knees, leading to food shortages and riots that threaten to topple the authoritarian regime.Could the same fate await Russia if sanctions are tightened and oil prices fall, forcing Putin to retreat behind the old borders while he attempts to quell internal strife?Last month, a group of economists gathered at the Brookings Institution in Washington to explore how tougher and more dynamic sanctions could further damage Russia’s war effort.Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Moscow has bought ahuge secondhand fleet of more than 400 vesselsto ship oil to Turkey, India and ahost of other countries. That “shadow fleet” has shrunk since 2024 to about half its former capacity, forcing Russia to rely on European-insured vessels to ship its oil.If European financial centres – London chief among them – were to take a tougher line on what they insure, Russian oil revenues could be severely hit.Yet this analysis ignores the successful rewiring of the economy by Putin’s administration, which has proved more adept in its handling of domestic politics and the government’s finances than it did the military in the first three years of the war.Russia can, and should, be hurt financially by further sanctions. But European leaders and Ukraine’s valuable allies in the US Congress, who have done so much to prevent Trump from siding wholeheartedly with his kindred spirit Putin, should not delude themselves into thinking that the Russian economy is on the brink of collapse.While economic growth has slowed to a near standstill, the broader strategy resembles a medically induced coma – designed to insulate the patient from unwanted outside interference.As optimists note, much of the government’s reserves are spent and oil revenues have fallen from 50% of state income to 25%. Yet Putin has found internal resources to fill the void, chiefly through higher taxes on households and businesses.Richard Connolly, at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, says: “The Kremlin has succeeded in selling the war, not as a battle with its near neighbour – its brothers and sisters in Ukraine – but as a war with the west.”On the impact of sanctions so far, he adds: “We are not near the economy being a decisive factor in the Kremlin’s thinking about how to pursue the war.”Russia’s debt-to-GDP ratio is just below 20%, while the annual spending deficit is about to hit 3.5% – modest by international standards, particularly when compared with the UK’s 11% deficit in the year Covid hit and a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 95%.Inflation soared after the invasion but has since been tamed, falling towards 6%, only modestly higher than the central bank target of 4%.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, in Delhi last month. India is turning away under a tougher sanctions regime.Photograph: Grigory Sysoev/ReutersThere is little doubt that Putin is turning the Russian economy into a junkyard, full of ageing and increasingly dysfunctional factories. He is milking it to aid the war effort without a care for the long-term consequences. But in the short term – this year and perhaps next – he can continue to fund the conflict without fearing economic collapse.China remains a friend and buyer of oil, while North Korea supplies people and kit, even if India and other beneficiaries of trade with Russia turn away under a tougher sanctions regime.Ukraine, meanwhile, has the money to continue for between 18 months and two years after the promise of €90bn from the EU. Putin, for his part, has the reserves to keep paying young men and their families to fight on.On Friday, Russialaunched hypersonic Oreshnik missilesat western Ukraine in a stark escalation of the conflict. The message for Europe is clear: it must help Ukraine push back harder militarily, ignoring Putin’s empty nuclear threats, while tightening the tourniquet on Russian trade.Four years of weak sanctions gave Putin time to reorganise. A tougher stance on trade may not trigger an economic collapse but Europe needs to work every angle to bring the war to an end.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsViewpoint columnVladimir PutinUkraineRussiaEuropeVenezuelaTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Is the ‘family values’ party listening?Sat 10 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 09.01 ESTShareWhat arealpro-family agenda looks likeI think we all need a little cheering up, don’t you? So allow me to interrupt the steady stream ofviolent authoritarianismand state-sponsored murder in your feed with some good news. New York City, which already provides free preschool for three- and four-year-olds, is a step closer to providing free universal childcare for two-year-olds. On Thursday, Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Zohran Mamdaniannounced a planfor the free childcare program, which they said will start by focusing on “high-need areas” and then gradually expand to cover the city. The mayor said he expected about 2,000 children to be covered by the program this fall.There are still a lot of questions about how the universal childcare program will be funded long-term and how exactly it will be rolled out. Nevertheless, even though it’s still in a very early stage, there’s a lot to celebrate here.First, there’s the fact that, not even two weeks into his role as mayor, Mamdani seems to be doing all he can to fulfil his bold campaign promises and affordability agenda. Most importantly, he’s shown he can work with the state governor, who has made it quite clear she is not hisbiggest fan, to get things done.America’s most crucial political faultline is in New York City | John R MacArthurRead more“To those who think that the promises of a campaign cannot survive once confronted with the realities of government, today is your answer,” Mamdani said at the event on Thursday.I hope that pro-natalists and representatives of the so-called “party of family values” are paying attention here. Sorry to state the bleeding obvious, but if you want people to have more kids, then this is how you do it. You don’t do it by making condoms more expensive (hello, China) or by removing access to safe and legal abortions (hello, USA) or by saying grandparents, not daycares, should be watching little kids (hello,JD Vance). Rather, you make it more affordable for people to have children. If you want to be a party of family values, you do that by actually helping young children thrive – not byseparating migrant families.I also hope that Democratic politicians are paying attention. Turns out that you can, in fact, aim high! You can, in fact, get things done! You don’t need to tell Republicans this, by the way. They are very good at having bold (albeit dystopian) ambitions and getting things done. Donald Trumpjust toldthe New York Times that the only limits on his power are his “own morality” and his “own mind”. I’m not condoning this, obviously! Still, nobody could accuse the Trump administration of not thinking big.Meanwhile the Democrats continually think small. They need to raise a few billion from you every election cycle so they can hire some highly paid consultants to create taskforces and policy papers and PowerPoint decks, which all conclude, regrettably, that nothing good can ever happen. Abandon your childish idealism because they, the “moderates” and the adults in the room, have decided that a better world just isn’t realistic. Still, make sure you vote blue no matter who (unless it’s a democratic socialist), because the other people are worse.“In writing this address, I have been told that this is the occasion to reset expectations, that I should use this opportunity to encourage the people of New York to ask for little and expect even less,” Mamdani said in hisinaugural address. “I will do no such thing. The only expectation I seek to reset is that of small expectations. We may not always succeed. But never will we be accused of lacking the courage to try.”Amen to that. We should all expect more from our politicians – who routinely seem to forget that they work for us, not a select few billionaires. Things seem hopeless at the moment, but we must continue to have the courage to try to fight for a better world.And now, after that moment of radical optimism, back to our regularly scheduled programming of doom and gloom.Stephen Miller continues to be a creepy little weirdoThe White House deputy chief of staff is probably the most influential, andmost dangerous, man in the Trump administration. The far-rightdeportation enthusiastwas thechief architectof the family separation and Muslim ban policies during Trump 1.0. Now he seems to be encouraging the administration to conquer the world with force. Along with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, Miller was akeypart of Trump deciding to kidnap the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro. “We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else,” Millertold CNN’s Jake Tapperon Monday. “But we live in a world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.” Expect more shows of force and power from this wannabe strongman.

Small states that stray into great-power conflicts rarely emerge unscathed. They are not players; they are expendables.It’s a statement that frames the reality of where Trinidad and Tobago sits uneasily today.For small states, geopolitics is not a theatre for bravado but a discipline of diplomacy and survival. That discipline has now collapsed. Trinidad and Tobago will pay the price of auctioning off its sovereignty to its neocolonial master, the US. The nation now sits dangerously exposed, economically, diplomatically, and potentially militarily, after theUS attack on Venezuelaand the extraordinary kidnapping of its president, Nicolás Maduro.With Delcy Rodríguez now installed as Venezuela’s president andDiosdado Cabellostill embedded, the Maduro regime remains largely intact. Trinidad and Tobago now faces an openly hostile neighbour whose senior leadership has denounced the dual island state’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, as a complicit enabler of US aggression and designated her persona non grata. This is not misfortune. It is the price of strategic misjudgment.This crisis did not arrive overnight. Through rhetorical excess, Persad-Bissessar has steadily narrowed our country’s room for manoeuvre. What is now unfolding is the predictable outcome of decades of amateurish improvisation masquerading as governance. Successive administrations have failed to articulate a coherent foreign policy for what was once the wealthiest country in the Caribbean.For small states, the cardinal sin is not choosing the “wrong” side but collapsing strategic ambiguity. That is precisely what Trinidad and Tobago did. Persad-Bissessar boxed her country in. Her public alignment with Washington’s racist dictator in chief, combined withdisparaging remarks toward respected Caribbean leadersand a casual dismissal of regional diplomacy and historic ties, has left Trinidad and Tobago isolated at precisely the moment when geopolitical flexibility was necessary.After the action in Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago finds itself isolated from one of its largest trading partnersDuring her earlier term, memorably declaring thatTrinidad and Tobago was “not the ATM of the Caribbean”, Persad-Bissessar signalled to our Caribbean community (Caricom) that regional solidarity was conditional and transactional. Yet Caricom is not a marketplace; it is a family. Disagreements are inevitable, but they are meant to be managed privately, with a public posture of unity that small states depend on for collective strength and survival.Today, the cost of that posture is coming due. After the action inVenezuela, Trinidad and Tobago finds itself isolated from one of its largest trading partners. Across the region, calls for boycotts have begun circulating. Leadership in geopolitics is not about sounding tough or forcing false choices. On that test, this administration has failed.This is not a story about choosing between Washington and Caracas. It is about what happens to small states when they mistake alignment for strategy.View image in fullscreenMaduro supporters hold up pictures of Kamla Persad-Bissessar during a rally against US and Trinidad and Tobago joint military exercises in Caracas, October 2025.Photograph: Pedro Mattey/AFP/Getty ImagesMuch ink has been spilled portraying Trump as the hero and Maduro as the villain. For small states, this distinction offers little protection. Both leaders operate through pressure, spectacle and intimidation. Both personalise power, elevate loyalty over competence, and govern through permanent crisis. Trump does so within institutions that are still resilient but eroding; Maduro atop institutions he had hollowed out. Both are widely perceived as corrupt. Both haveenriched their families, allies, cronies and themselves. Both have the same instincts but different power. Small states, such as Trinidad and Tobago, do not get the luxury of moral binaries when caught between rival strongmen. They get consequences.Venezuela’s relationship with the Caribbean has been economic and strategic. Several states became structurally exposed to Caracas through energy dependence, most notably throughPetroCaribe, launched in 2005 under Chávez, which offered concessional oil financing framed as development support rather than commercial exchange. These arrangements created not only economic ties but political memory. It is notable that the largest number of Venezuelan refugees in the Caribbean live in Trinidad and Tobago.Forget petty bribes, ‘state capture’ is corruption so deep it is shaping the rules of democracy itself | Kenneth MohammedRead moreAgainst this backdrop, expanding US military activity in Trinidad was sold ascounter-narcotics cooperation. Radar installations, “capacity building”, joint exercises – all whilekillings continued unexplainedoff the Venezuelan coast. Trump confirmed what many suspected: this was never about drugs. It is about oil, gas and minerals – what he frames as wealth “stolen” from US corporations during Venezuela’s nationalisation drive. From ExxonMobil to ConocoPhillips,US corporations were systematically expelledunder Chávez and Maduro.Demanding sovereignty has always been the real crime in the region, from Cuba in the north to Venezuela in the south. Without the selective amnesia that often accompanies western commentary, let’s state plainly: Venezuela is a sovereign state whose sovereignty has been repeatedly violated by the US and the UK. Since 2015, US sanctions have immiserated a society, accelerating the collapse of what was a wealthy country anddisplacing millions of people.The most egregious symbol of this pattern was Britain’s seizure of roughly$1.95bn (£1.4bn) in Venezuelan gold held in London– funds refused to Venezuela even during Covid, when they could have financed medicines and humanitarian relief. This was not an anomaly but precedent.First was the refusal to recognise Maduro after Chávez. Thenthe farce of Juan Guaidó– a western-backed fiction who never won an election and never governed. The script has been recycled with María Corina Machado, burnished with accolades and recast as a “president in waiting”, despite inviting foreign military intervention against her own country. She, too, has now beendiscarded by Trumpas not having “respect within the country”. Persad-Bissessar would do well to note the pattern.View image in fullscreenA photo of Trinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, is held up in Venezuela’s parliament as she is declared persona non grata, October 2025.Photograph: Federico Parra/AFP/Getty ImagesMany Venezuelans may despise Maduro. But it is misreading to assume this translates into affection for Washington. Among Venezuelans there is hostility, the US seen as an architect of imperialism. The illusion that Trinidad and Tobago could host US security infrastructure without becoming entangled in Trump’s vendetta was always just that – an illusion by a naive leader.But this crisis cannot be pinned on one government alone. Former prime minister, Keith Rowley, pursued the opposite folly: courting Caracas, indulging in displays of friendship with Maduro, alienating Washington. Rowley and Persad-Bissessar are opportunists. One flirted with the Caracas dictator; the other leans toward Washington’s authoritarianism. Neither built a doctrine grounded in Caribbean collective security. The result is exposure without leverage.None of this is unprecedented.In 2003 Nelson Mandela said, “If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world it is the United States of America. They don’t care for human beings.“To say, look, this is the power that we have, if you dare oppose what we do, this is what is going to happen to you. Who are they now, to pretend that they are the policemen of the world?”Should conflict escalate, Trinidad will bear the costs – economic collapse, refugee inflows, long-term instabilityThat same year Noam Chomsky describeda US “grand imperial strategy”bent on securing global dominance regardless of international law or human cost.All that is new today is brazenness. Invoking the colonialMonroe doctrineto justify stealing Venezuelan oil is pathetic. Under Trump, dissent is framed as unpatriotic, even treasonous. Allies are coerced. Smaller states are used and discarded. Targets are selected solely for resource endowment: oil, gas, minerals.So where does this leave Trinidad and Tobago?Internally, the country is divided – and soon distracted by carnival. Evasive explanations about “airport works” and US radar installations will fade from public memory. But regionally, Trinidad will remain estranged.If perceived – fairly or not – as complicit in US military action against Venezuela, there will be no oil and gas deals with a Rodríguez-led government. The potential loss exceeds $1.2bn annually. Should conflict escalate, Trinidad will bear the costs – economic collapse, refugee inflows, long-term instability – while Washington moves on to its next theatre in Greenland or Cuba.In the end, the hard truth is this: small states such as ours are not geopolitical actors but geopolitical spaces. When leaders forget that distinction, their people are impoverished and their countries become expendable pawns.Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoOpinionVenezuelaAmericasTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

I’ve found myself in dozens of countries working with activists, politicians and civil servants to untangle the complex technical questions raised by the internet, andevery one of our discussions ended in the same place. “OK,” they’d say, “you’ve definitely laid out the best way to regulate tech, but we can’t do it.”Why not? Because – inevitably – the US trade rep had beaten me to every one of those countries and made it eye-wateringly clear that if they regulated tech in a way that favoured their own people, industries and national interests, the US wouldbury them in tariffs.But deterrents are a funny thing. If someone demands that you follow their orders or they’ll burn your house down, so you do, and they burn your house down anyway … well, you’re a bit of a fool if you keep on doing what they tell you, aren’t you?Donald Trump’s tariffshave opened up a new possibility for the technology we have become increasingly dependent on. Today, nearly all of our tech comes from US companies, and it arrives as aprix fixemeal. If you want to talk with your friends on a Meta platform, you have to let Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg eavesdrop on your conversations. If you want to have a phone that works, you have to let Apple’s Tim Cook suck30p out of every poundyou spend and give him a veto over which software you can run. If you want to search the web, you have to let Google’s Sundar Pichai know what colour underwear you’ve got on.This is a genuinely odd place for digital computers to have got to. Every computer in your life, from your mobile phone to your smart speaker to your laptop to your TV, is theoretically capable of runningallprogrammes, including the ones the manufacturers would really prefer you stay away from. This means that there are noprix fixemenus in technology – everything can be had à la carte. Thanks to the infinite flexibility of computers, every 10-foot fence a US tech boss installs in a digital product you rely on invites a programmer to supply you with a four-metre ladder so you can scamper nimbly over it. However, we adopted laws – at the insistence of the US trade rep – that prohibit programmers from helping you alter the devices you own, in legal ways, if the manufacturer objects. This is one thing that leads to what I refer to as theenshittificationof technology.There is only one reason the world isn’t bursting with wildly profitable products and projects thatdisenshittifythe US’s defective products: its (former) trading partners were bullied into passingan “anti-circumvention” lawthat bans the kind of reverse-engineering that is the necessary prelude to modifying an existing product to make it work better for its users (at the expense of its manufacturer). But the Trump tariffs change all that. The old bargain – put your own tech sector in chains, expose your people to our plunder of their data and cash, and in return, the US won’t tariff your exports – is dead.This means digital rights activists who’ve been trying to get rid of the “anti-circumvention” laws have a new potential ally: investors and technologists who’d like to make ahell of a lot of moneyraiding the margins of the most profitable lines of business of the most profitable companies the world has seen.In the UK, reverse engineering is restricted underarticle 6of the European software directive of 2001. US companies have capitalised on this fact – that British companies cannot modify their products – to spy on us and whack us with sky-high fees. Now, post-Brexit, the UK is uniquely able to seize this moment. Unlike our European cousins, we needn’t wait for the copyright directive to be repealed before we can strike article 6 off our own law books and thereby salvage something good out of Brexit.What’s more, this is a proven business. US tech platforms extract hundreds of billions in rents and junk fees from all over the world. As Jeff Bezos told publishers when he founded Amazon: “Your margin is my opportunity.” Why shouldn’t we move fast and breakJeff’sthings?Makinghundreds of billions of dollars every year is a far superior course of action to building a bunch of datacentres in support of an AI sector that islosingbillions of dollars every year and heading for a tremendous crash, and we can do it without destroying what’s left of our water supply and crashing our creaking power grid. There are plenty of technologists who have been forcibly ejected from the US and would jump at the chance to drain their former employers’ billions. There’s also plenty of investors looking for a business opportunity whose success doesn’t hinge on how many$TRUMP coinsthey buy.It’s not just digital rights activists, investors and entrepreneurs who have a dog in this fight. Now that Trump has made it clear that the US no longer has allies or trading partners, only rivals and adversaries, everyone in the world is trying to figure out whether they can trust American tech infrastructure with their governments, businesses and personal data.The answer is a resounding “no”. Just look at the international criminal court, which ditched Microsoft Office for a European alternative after Trump sanctioned its officials for issuing an arrest warrant for thegénocidaireBenjamin Netanyahu. Directly after Trump denounced the court, its justices lost access to all their Microsoft accounts – emails, documents, calendar, address book. The court was, in effect, “bricked”. Microsoft denies this, but between the justices of the international criminal court and the US tech monopolist, I know who I trust.Trump is capable of weaponising the US’s tech companies, and there’s no telling where it will end. Remember that when Russianlooters stole millionsof dollars’ worth of John Deere tractors and spirited them away to Chechnya, the company was able to push a kill signal to the tractors that rendered them inoperable.Until we repeal the anti-circumvention law, we can’t reverse-engineer the US’s cloud software, whether it’s a database, a word processor or a tractor, in order to swap out proprietary, American code for robust, open, auditable alternatives that will safeguard our digital sovereignty. The same goes for any technology tethered to servers operated by any government that might have interests adverse to ours – say, the solar inverters and batteries we buy from China.This is the state of play at the dawn of 2026. The digital rights movement has two powerful potential coalition partners in the fight to reclaim the right of people to change how their devices work, to claw back privacy and a fair deal from tech: investors and national security hawks.Admittedly, the door is only open a crack, but it’s been locked tight since the turn of the century. When it comes to a better technology future, “open a crack” is the most exciting proposition I’ve heard in decades.Cory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist and journalist.

There is a short message with jumbled letters on barely erased pencilled lines: “Happy Birthday Minoli nenda”.(Nenda is aunt in Sinhala.) I put down my bags and breathe.‘Happy Birthday Minoli nenda!!’As I move around the world, postcards have become a way to tell people I love that I’m thinking of them. It’s not a picture that I post on Instagram Stories that disappears in 24 hours, or a WhatsApp message that gets lost among the many notifications. A postcard is tangible. It is real.The sending of a postcard is a labour of love and picking the perfect one is an art. The image says something about the connection between me and my recipient; the common threads that join us. Deciding what to write and the process of putting pen to paper is therapeutic. It makes the recipient a part of my day, as I invite them to share a moment sitting on the grass in the sun or rattle along with me on a shaky train.Then there’s the procurement of stamps, which involves figuring out when the post office is open and choosing ones that are fun or interesting. Finally I stop by a postbox and slide in the postcard hoping it gets delivered – I don’t get a notification indicating delivery. It is out there in the world, beyond my control.‘The postman found the image so hilarious that he told my surprised mother just how funny it was to see.’Photograph: Minoli WijetungaReceiving a postcard is a process of love and community. I like to imagine a bored post office employee skimming through this message between two strangers as they stamp it. But I don’t have to imagine the possible conversations that could happen, as once my partner sent me a postcard to my parents’ house of “Bronzed Aussies”. This one sported a bunch of half-naked, ripped men on a beach. The postman found the image so hilarious that he told my surprised mother just how funny it was to see.A postcard is intended to be a short communication between two people. But a whole community witnesses – and hopefully enjoys – facilitating this connection. In an age where meaningful dialogue seems to be something we have lost, postcards are a way to hold on to something that is beyond description.Postcards have always been an object of fascination for me. I remember flipping through photo albums as a young girl and coming across those sent to my parents, from people I had never met. When I asked who these people were, I would hear wistful stories. Sometimes, I knew who the people were, and would then try to connect the aunt or uncle I know with the person who wrote it. It was a fascinating exercise.As I grew older, I’d buy postcards for myself. Picking the perfect one was a learned skill. It had to capture the essence of the place and how I felt while there.‘According to the artist, it’s “a good monster with powers and weapons” who will look over and bless me.’Photograph: Minoli WijetungaIt wasn’t until Covid, when I was living on my own away from friends, family and the familiar, that I rediscovered connection through postcards. I would pick a card that was an illustration of my university and write to my partner about sitting in an alcove, eating a falafel wrap while the winter sun warmed my hands. Or I would pick one with a Highland cow and write to my friend about seeing one for the first time and how adorable they are. Each card was more than a piece of paper. It was love.So when the child of one of my closest childhood friends turned three, I started sending him his own postcards. His mother would receive one but Chethi would receive one too. In Vietnam, I found a card of a little girl wearing a nón lá – a conical hat. At the back, I wrote about how they are made of palm leaves.In Japan, I asked my partner – who had started drawing postcards – to draw origami paper cranes on it. At the back, I wrote about the tradition of a thousand origami cranes, and how it was everywhere in Hiroshima. I told him to ask his mother about the bombing of Japan (alongside a note to her with a heads-up).Three years after I started writing to him, Chethi sent me his first postcard. He had drawn a monster and had written on it. My friend had sent me a note to say that she’s not sure what the monster is but, according to the artist, it’s “a good monster with powers and weapons” who will look over and bless me. It now hangs on my fridge. I see him every morning.I think the blessing works, and seeing it every morning – among other postcards from friends from all over the world – makes me start the day with a smile.Minoli Wijetunga is a PhD candidate researching education and technologyExplore more on these topicsFriendshipOpinionPostcardscommentShareReuse this content"

I felt calmer than I had for monthsSat 10 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 19.20 ESTShareWhen my daughter started kindergarten many years ago, she’d walk into the room and head straight for the puzzle table. While other kids would scoop up a ball from the basket and rush through the double doors to the back yard, she was strictly a jigsaw person.I don’t remember teaching her how to attack a jigsaw, she just knew. She’d start with hunting out the four corner pieces, move on to the edges, and then concentrate on building the picture, filling out blocks of colour or pattern. She worked methodically through the stack of puzzles one by one and, when she’d finish doing them, then she’d go outside and play.I’d never been a jigsaw puzzle person until I had children but the delight I witnessed in my daughter meant I started buying them from garage sales whenever I had the chance.Snap decisions: why crowding into a photo booth with friends is still a magical experience | Nova WeetmanRead moreSecond-hand jigsaws are obviously a risky purchase because they often have pieces missing but mostly we’d muddle through the boxes and, once we’d finish them, I’d return them to an op shop with the lids taped shut, so somebody else could experience the joy. One year a friend even used a photograph of my daughter to have a 500-piece puzzle made of her face as a Christmas present and we lay on the floor on our stomachs until we finished it.When my kids hit their teenage years, they outgrew the sparkly unicorn and dragon puzzles, so I gave most of them away to friends with younger children. We didn’t really have the space for undertaking a larger puzzle, because our dining table was too small, so we stopped puzzling, and nobody seemed to miss it. Instead, my daughter introduced the household to card games they played at school, and soon we were playing ruthless rounds of Cheat, Blackjack and Poker after dinner each night. Sometimes we’d surrender a Sunday afternoon to a long and brutal game of Monopoly or Catan but mostly we were all about the speed of a game of cards.When my dad died unexpectedly last year, I found it hard to relax.I started with the four corners, moved on to the edges, and then began filling in small patches of colourMy brain would loop and race through thoughts and worries, and I struggled to write or to finish projects. We spent months cleaning out his house and divvying up his furniture and I inherited the long dining table we’d eaten from as kids which could house an impressive feast, and also fit the slow construction of a large jigsaw puzzle.One afternoon I was emptying out my cupboards and found a 1,000-piece jigsaw that my daughter had bought me one Christmas that I hadn’t even unwrapped. It was a puzzle of a lush garden and a stream, and I knew just by looking at the picture on the box that it would be difficult because there were so many patches of similar colours. It was the perceived difficulty of it that made me sit down at Dad’s dining table and open the box. Just like my daughter had done, I started with the four corners, moved on to the edges, and then began filling in small patches of colour. That first morning, I only stopped to change the record I was listening to, and to refill my cup of tea.Hours drifted, and the puzzle started taking shape.My dad died suddenly while I was in Japan. A memory of him lives on in my fridge | Nova WeetmanRead moreFor the next week or so, I’d begin each day in my pyjamas, sitting at the table and puzzling. Sometimes I’d work for an hour or so and then return over lunch and do a little more. The cat was so frustrated by my lack of attention that she’d bound up on to the table and plonk right in the middle of the section of jigsaw I was focused on. If I tried to move her, she’d miaow at me, so I mostly left her where she was and moved on to another section.Soon I realised that it was the first time in months that I’d felt in my body. Instead of overthinking everything, all I cared about was searching through the box for the right-shaped piece to fill a gap in the picture. I didn’t even mind what the picture was. I just needed to find the right spot for each piece. The simplicity of doing something that existed only to complete was like a meditation. And when I finished that puzzle and smoothed my hands across the 1,000 pieces that linked up to create the picture, I felt calmer than I had for months.Minutes after I finished, I pulled the puzzle apart, boxed up the pieces, sealed the box and went to the op shop to buy another. I’m just hoping this one doesn’t have any pieces missing.Nova Weetman is an award-winning author of books for children and young adultsExplore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingOpinionBereavementParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

YuckSat 10 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 12.49 ESTSharePicture the scene: you enter a lovely clean hotel room. There are newly laundered crisp sheets and fluffy fresh towels. But as you sit on the bed, the cushions let out a cloud of dust and you realise the bed is covered with an unwashed bedspread that has been sat on by every other guest who has ever visited this room. It’s usually slung across the bottom of the bed, so lots of them have probably put their feet on it, too.I hate decorative cushions and throws on hotel beds. The first thing I do on seeing them is remove them with the tips of my fingers and shove them in the wardrobe. Doesn’t everyone?Due to the often impressive efficiency of hospital corners on the bed, removing the throws can be a challenge, frequently resulting in wresting the entire duvet off the bed so I can discard the offending bedspread. And don’t get me started on when everything reappears on the bed the next day, and I have to begin my weird ritual all over again.I have a fairly normal standard of cleanliness. I’m not too bothered by the occasional cobweb or spot of dust. But the sight of cushions and throws on hotel beds fills me with dread. I can’t help thinking they are massively unhygienic – and ultimately gross. Who knows how many other people have used them and when they were last, if ever, washed.It’s puzzling as to why they are there, when part of the charm of staying at a hotel is the promise of a clean, fresh space to sleep. We all know other people have slept in the hotel bed before us, but something about the level of cleaning between each guest helps us to suspend disbelief and allows us to forget that we are sharing a bed with hundreds of strangers.The room is usually perfectly made up with a freshly restocked mini-fridge and packaged-up toiletries. We are made to feel as if we are opening the door to a place untarnished by other people. So why then, on the bed, the centre to all this, do they plonk this pile of old, unhygienic fabric? It might be for aesthetics, and sure, a scatter cushion or textural throw might look nice. But any visual pleasure is instantly undone by the full-body cringe when you consider the volume of strangers’ dust particles trapped inside it.In the romcom Along Came Polly, Jennifer Aniston’s free spirit Polly is seen helping free Ben Stiller’s uptight Reuben from the tyranny of his multiple scatter cushions. She does this by encouraging him to plunge a kitchen knife into his useless bedding accessories. “I’m liberating you,” she tells him. “Wow, that feels really good,” he replies, destroying the pillow.This catharsis is what I need when facing a hotel cushion or throw. At home they might feel pointless but in a hotel, they are both pointless and disgusting: plain wrong. Please liberate me from the horror of ever seeing them again on top of a joyfully clean hotel bed.Annabel Lee is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsHotelsOpinionHygieneHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

As reported by the Guardian, Trinity Hall justified the move by claiming that a focus only on “greater fairness in admissions” could “unintentionally result in reverse discrimination”. Alumni LinkedIn feeds and social media threads quickly filled with outrage, as many Cambridge graduates interpreted the move as class prejudice rearing its ugly head once again. One angry fellow at the college said it amounted to a “slap in the face” for their state-educated undergraduates.It brought back memories of the sneering snobbery at Oxford when the former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, then principal of Lady Margaret Hall, introduced a new foundation year. “We don’t do hard luck stories,”sniffed one academic. “Oxford doesn’t do remedial education,” complained another. The foundation year at Oxford and also at Cambridge has since enjoyed huge success, proving that students who have faced great adversity or academic disadvantage can flourish when given the chance.The words “reverse discrimination” are jarring. Whatever the intentions behind Trinity Hall’s policy, singling out a tiny cadre of already highly resourced schools sends a powerful signal: that academic quality is most reliably found there, and moving beyond this clique risks lowering standards. In a society marked by extreme inequalities in wealth, schooling and opportunity, the claim that these institutions are the victims of discrimination would be difficult to sustain – even by the cleverest of Cambridge dons.For others, this is a classic case of what the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu would term “misrecognition”: mistaking polished performance and extra preparation, which is so often shaped by privilege, for greater underlying talent – and sincerely believing this to be fair. The furore centres on recruitment for a handful of places in subjects such as music, classics and modern languages, which are prey to the most gaping of educational disparities. Many state schools simply cannot offer them in depth, if at all. Access to musical instruments, orchestras, private tuition, Latin or Greek and overseas travel has remained a privilege rather than a universal opportunity. To treat these unequal starting points as evidence of unequal ability is to mistake years of private rehearsal for natural merit.It is little surprise that battles over talent are intensifying at a time of declining levels of social mobility, widening wealth divides and an increasingly detached and powerful elite. Yet the profound generational opportunity divides we face seem beyond the scope of today’s politicians, many of whom would not now dare name, let alone challenge, a class system in which advantage and power are being systemically hoarded by elites.In a world of spiralling living costs, and even despite thegraduate jobs crisis, a coveted place at a top-tier university is still the golden ticket to the high-status jobs that can transform lives. For the vast majority of the population lacking serious wealth, it is one of the few routes left to the highly paid careers that may allow you to one day buy your own home – a diminishing prospect for generations growing up today.The dials of opportunity are all pointing in the wrong direction – not least the gap in elite university enrolments between private and state schools. In truth, the most persistent admissions gap at Oxbridge is between a tiny cadre of top schools and the rest. In 2011, a Sutton Trust study found thatfour private schools and one sixth-form collegesent more pupils to Oxford and Cambridge over three years than 2,000 schools and colleges across the UK. In 2018,a follow-up studyconcluded “little had changed”. Since then, there has been some progress on admissions statistics, but recent data shows regress at Cambridge – with the university scrapping targets for state school admissions in 2024, under a policy imposed by the Office for Students.As Trinity Hall’s policy itself acknowledges, securing greater fairness in admissions is a crucial task. Universities would do well to look to some of the world’s top global companies, which are now ahead of the curve in the talent game. In my work with leading employers, from law firms to banks, professional services and tech companies, I’m seeing a decisive shift away from blunt diversity drives towards a more forensic examination of what talent looks like. Many diversity efforts have defaulted to identity tick-boxes, leaving untouched the class-based workplace practices that determine who is recognised as talented and who gets ahead.This is the hard business case for social mobility: disentangling which traits genuinely drive performance and which are simply learned behaviours associated with privileged upbringing. In my book Cracking the Class Codes, co-authored with Anne-Marie Sim, out later this year, we set out the cultural markers that operate as hidden signals of talent and belonging in elite firms and universities. Confidence in interviews, fluency in abstract discussion, ease in challenging authority: these traits feel natural to those who possess them and are easily mistaken for innate ability. In reality, they are the accumulated product of years of advantage. This is about making expectations explicit, transparent and teachable for all employees, rather than leaving them as tacit codes benefiting a fortunate few.Prestigious universities face exactly the same challenge. They can continue to select students already trained to succeed in their existing environments, or they can do the harder work of asking whether their environments themselves need to change to nurture all talents.Doubtless, there is a case for making social class a legally protected characteristic, forcing institutions to confront discrimination more directly. But universities already have it within their power to design admissions systems that reward talent, irrespective of background. The test of a great university is not whether it attracts those already trained to succeed, but whether it can recognise and cultivate potential wherever it exists. At a time of deepening opportunity divides, that distinction has never mattered more.Lee Elliot Major is a professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter.

They had clearly forgotten the joy of watching half-clad hulks with silly names go to battle, says superfan Helen Pidd as she heads backstageHelen PiddSat 10 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareWhen Gladiators is filming at the Sheffield Arena, it feels as if everyone is in on the joke. The woman in the ticket office looks at me gravely. “Before I give you these,” she says, “I need to ask a question. These areverygood tickets. You’re in the camera block, near the red contestant’s friends and family. So there’s something I need to know. If the camera is on you, are you going to duck and hide and get all embarrassed? Or are you going to go absolutely flipping mental?”I’ve been up until the early hours painting portraits of my favourite Gladiators with the precise hope of making it on to the telly. Of course I’m going to go absolutely flipping mental! I’ve been waiting for this day since 1992.That was when Gladiators muscled its way into the Saturday night viewing schedule of every kid in Britain, a copy of an American gameshow that pitted superhuman bodybuilders with silly names against fitness enthusiasts with ordinary jobs. You’d have Saracen using a pugil stick to batter Colin, a painter and decorator from Runcorn; or Lightning chasing Suzie, a dinner lady from Woking, up a climbing wall. It was an immediate playground sensation, spawning catchphrases that are etched indelibly on the memory of every 90s kid. Shout, “Contenders, ready!” in a Scottish accent to any of my contemporaries and they will reply, “Gladiators, ready!” quicker than they can remember their own children’s birthdays.The boys had posters of Jet, the buxom brunette, on their walls. The girls fancied Hunter, a blond with pecs the size of car tyres. Everyone pretended to hate Wolf, the show’s resident villain and theatrical bad loser, who would sometimes be awarded yellow cards for unsportsmanlike behaviour – one of which he once gobbled in protest.View image in fullscreenThe original Gladiators, including bad guy Wolf (front right) …View image in fullscreen… being cheered on by an audience in Birmingham. Photographs: ITV/ShutterstockYou could watch it with your mum and dad without it being embarrassing. You could recreate it in PE when your teacher wasn’t looking. Wolf aside, it was an hour-long lesson in fair play, where the strongest man or woman always won in the end – in a nail-biting finale known as the Eliminator, which involved a scrambling net, a zipwire and the fearsome 45-degree Travelator.Yet when the BBC brought back Gladiators in 2024, the commission was greeted with derision, proof that our public broadcaster had run out of ideas. Alex Mahon, then chief executive of Channel 4,singled it outas exactly the sort of thing the BBCshouldn’tbe making. But as soon as the titles rolled and everyone over 35 realised they could still remember the lyrics of the theme tune – “Do you have the speed, the strength, the heart to be a winner? It’s not for beginners” – it was a hit.‘Gladiators ... ready!’ Whatever became of Wolf, Jet, Rhino and the show’s other stars?Read moreAlmost nine million peoplewatched the first episode. It vastly overperformed among young people, none of whom were born when the original Gladiators came off air in the year 2000. It’s that rarest of things: a show the whole family can watch together. A slice of silliness in scary times. With the third series about to air, BBC executives will be hoping the Gladiators can unite the nation, shouting at their tellies like they did whenNick Mohammed failed to pick Alan Carr as a traitorlast autumn.Thirty-three years after I first booed Wolf in front of a TV dinner, I’m sitting in the third row of the Sheffield Arena waving a foam finger as a contestant crashes to the mat while Another One Bites the Dust booms from the PA. And they say dreams don’t come true.I’d gone so mad making posters, I even had one that read simply “CLATTENBURG” in honour of Mark Clattenburg, the former badboy of football refereeing who adjudicates in the reboot. I wave it manically in his direction and my friend Danika and I dissolve into schoolgirl giggles when he spots it and makes a heart with his thumbs and forefingers. We both squeal when he first booms the immortal words, “Contender, you will go on my first whistle … ”Four months later, I’m in a photo studio in Salford being lifted aloft by five Gladiators. Hammer has  my feet, Apollo my thighs, Nitro my bottom, Cyclone my shoulders and Dynamite is complaining there is nothing left of me to hold but my head. Nitro, the eldest of the group at 37, takes charge of art direction. “Extend your arm out like Cleopatra,” he instructs. I’m trying to breathe in while enjoying the moment, but Hammer keeps calling me Thunder – he had asked me just beforehand what my Gladiator name would be – and I’m struggling to keep it together.It’s all part of my mission to discover why Gladiators has recaptured the nation’s hearts and recreated the magic for a whole new generation. And if that means they have to pick me up so that I can test their strength, well, I’m here to serve.View image in fullscreenThe Catapult challenge in the original series …Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockView image in fullscreen… and new Gladiator Giant battling Sam Thompson in a celebrity special.Photograph: Graeme Hunter/BBC/Hungry Bear Media LtdSoon I’m sitting on a sofa with Apollo, all 6ft 6in of him squeezed into his red and blue unitard. With his floppy hair and smooth skin, Apollo looks as if he has aged out of a boyband, though he is in fact a former England rugby player andAmerican football tight end. There’s a touch of Alan Partridge to Apollo, real name Alex Gray. I ask how old he is and he says, “I’ve been 29 for the past five years.” His persona is of a nice guy with an arrogant edge. He recites poetry between challenges (self-penned, he assures me – “The new Shakespeare, they’re saying”) and pretends everyone fancies him.I ask him to introduce himself for the tape. He replies in verse: “I am the man of the hour, a guy too sweet to be sour, who guys want to be mates with, and girls want to go on dates with.” Guys don’t just want to be mates with you, Apollo! You’re a gay icon, I say. “Guilty,” he replies. “I‘ve got a lot of love from all sorts of different diverse communities, which has been fantastic. The gays, the mums, the teenage girls.”So, then, Apollo, are you single? As the words come out of my mouth, I realise I sound like a bit of a pervert. I plough on regardless. Is he on the celebrity dating app, Raya? He laughs and dodges the question. “I’m gonna be honest with you, I’ve probably never been more wanted in my life, but I’ve never been more cautious. There’s a responsibility that comes with being a Gladiator and I don’t take it lightly. You know, I love playing up to the myth of Apollo but at the same time I wanna be a decent person and when I’m not on the show, I like to keep out of trouble as much as I can.”After Gregg Wallace-gate and various Strictly scandals, the BBC cannot afford any whiff of controversy around another prime-time show. That’s why the Gladiators are drug tested each season. Giant, a man mountain with a ridiculous triangular torso, had to apologise last yearwhen a video emerged of himseemingly posting about taking steroids in his pre-Gladiator life as a bodybuilder (“Take this and you’ll get big,” he allegedly promised). He was supposed to be at the shoot but is too busy appearing in panto in Chesterfield (he’s in Jack and the Beanstalk, playing … the giant, of course).View image in fullscreen‘A man mountain with a ridiculous triangular torso’: Giant, AKA Jamie Christian-Johal.Photograph: David MacCormack/BBC/Hungry Bear Media LtdYou won’t catch the Gladiators falling out of nightclubs either, or falling prey to kiss’n’tells. Hammer – another 6ft 6-er, a champion indoor rower called Tom Wilson – looks like a bit of a lad, though I know full well he’s engaged because his fiance was sitting behind me at the Arena, where she politely but firmly refused to tell me whether Gladiators put the bins out. I tell him I like to imagine him out on the lash with Giant and Bionic, yet another 6ft 6in monolith who has bleached blond hair like an early career Gary Barlow. He insists that simply does not happen. “No, not at all. We like to just keep fit and stay away from anything like that really, because it affects your sleep, it affects your recovery and I think it’s important just to be super fit and super recovered and super rested,” he says.Part of Gladiators’ success is its appeal to young and old. Apollo pitches his lines at the adults in the audience, like when he fishes a mobile phone out of his Lycra in season two andseems to take a call after being beatenon the climbing wall. “Your mum says hello,” he shouts up to the victorious contender. He lets me into a secret. He hadn’t had the phone on him all the time. “As you can see,” he says, gesturing to his hot pants and making me blush, “there’s not enough room.”Each of the 18 Gladiators has a slightly different outfit to showcase their special powers or, in the case of Nitro’s scoop-necked number, their outrageous pecs. Five are made for each character each season and they are not allowed to keep them when they are not on duty. “They don’t trust me ’cause they know I would go down the shops in it,” Apollo says.Hammer is the only one who has a prop (it’s a hammer). He feigns outrage when I suggest he is only pretending it is heavy. “When you’re swinging that around, you sure know about it,” he insists. I am disappointed the hammer has not made it to the photoshoot but the PR says that would have been her job “and it’s 15kg, that thing”. Hammer is the viking of the group, with long dark locks that I’d heard were bulked out with hair extensions. He’s having none of it. “This is all mine,” he says, gesturing to the man bun he wears when he is not in character. Up close, I do detect a touch of Just For Men in his beard, though.View image in fullscreenOriginal referee John Anderson …Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockView image in fullscreen… and new boy Mark Clattenburg, with (from left) Viper, AKA Quang Luong, co-host Bradley Walsh and contender Finley Burkitt.Photograph: BBC/Hungry Bear Media LtdThe modern-day Gladiators make most of their money now as social media influencers, but 22-year-old Dynamite – CrossFit and weightlifting champion Emily Steel – is hoping for at least a side hustle in music. During the shoot she is writing lyrics for a duet with Apollo, who will apparently be contributing his poetry to the verses. Some of the original 90s Gladiators are still profiting from the show. Fabio, the Guardian photographer, tells me that this year alone he has donetwo shoots with Wolffor a German garage door company. Others have gone in an entirely different direction.Hunteris now a gong bath healer.It was the show’s producers who came up with the Gladiator characters, then cast them afterwards. Resident baddie Legend, AKA fitness influencer Matt Morsia, did not have to work hard to behave like an arrogant show-off. He vies with Viper – former model Quang Luong – as the reboot’s Wolf. When I watch the show in Sheffield, little children scream with equal terror and delight as Viper – who growls instead of speaks – rampages through the stands to rip up their posters.The biggest pat on the back we get is when families say, ‘You’ve brought us back together.’ It feels like I’m playing for EnglandNitro – former champion sprinter Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, who is probably the most famous of the current crop after his appearance on this year’s Strictly – recalls walking through a supermarket and being stopped by a little girl and her dad. “I said, ‘Who’s your favourite Gladiator?’ And the girl stopped and gave me a deep stare and said, ‘Viper.’ I asked why and she said, ‘Because he’s naughty!’ And I think to myself, that girl could probably have a few red flags in her life. But you know, if she likes him, she likes him. A little five-year-old, sweetest little thing, dressed in a pink dress.”Last year the producers decided they needed a female Gladiator with a dark side. The rest of the girls tend to play nicely and congratulate contenders who beat them, which sets a good example but can get a little dull. Bad losers are far more entertaining. Enter Cyclone, 24-year-old Irish powerlifterLystus Ebosele, who looks as if she wants to rip contestants’ heads off. I just love watching big strong women, especially at a time when so many women in the public eye are shrinking. It’s so refreshing to hear 5ft 10in Cyclone say she loves “taking up space” and eats as much as she can in the run-up to filming “so I can be massive”.View image in fullscreenNew Gladiators (from left) Apollo (Alex Gray), Dynamite (Emily Steel), Cyclone (Lystus Ebosele), Nitro (Harry Aikines-Aryeetey) and Hammer (Tom Wilson). Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian, assisted by Noah Lennon. Hair and makeup: Jennifer Gooding, assisted by Mandy Winrow. Location: Chief TV Studio, ManchesterI am fascinated by the Gladiators’ diets. Hammer starts his day with six eggs and “a bucket of porridge”, and gets through a kilo of rice every day, as well as three or four chicken breasts (his goal is to inhale 750g of protein daily). When they go out for dinner in Sheffield it’s chaos because so many of the Gladiators order two pizzas each. The whole time I interview Nitro he is stuffing Haribo in his mouth.Dynamite is the first to arrive at the shoot and boulders through the door asking what’s for lunch. (It’s 11am.) “I don’t want to be really skinny and break every time I get tackled on Powerball, you know. I want to be able to absolutely plough through contenders,” she says.I have always wanted to know whether the Gladiators are actually trying, especially on the Gauntlet, where contenders have to run through a corridor of huge gladiators wielding ramrods and power pads. Or Powerball, where the Gladiators rugby-tackle the contenders to stop them slamming balls into baskets. Some of the contenders are tiny. Size isn’t everything, Hammer says. “I’m always trying. They’re tricky sometimes, though. You gotta watch them. They can turn real quick. We’re massive, so we can’t turn as quickly. But I’m not going easy on no one.”At the filming in Sheffield I bump into Aneila Afsar, who came second in series two, and ask her whether she felt the Gladiators were always giving it 100%. On some of the games, yes, she says, such as Unleash, when a Gladiator is basically chasing a contender around an assault course. “But I think honestly, when it comes to things like Powerball, some of us would get flattened if they were really going 100%. I mean you’ve got people there like Fury, who played rugby for England, and Cyclone. I mean, I was one of the smaller contenders. I think if I’d been hit at 100% force, I probably wouldn’t have lasted very long. You’d have injured contestants left, right and centre, wouldn’t you?”View image in fullscreen‘Some of us would get flattened if they were really going 100%’: Aneila Afsar, the show’s first hijabi contender.Photograph: Graeme Hunter/BBC/Hungry Bear Media LtdGetting injured is an occupational hazard for the Gladiators, too. By the time the forthcoming series wrapped, Legend, Athena, Diamond and Bionic were all either on crutches or wearing slings. If any of those are your favourites, fear not: they’ll all be appearing throughout the series, just not necessarily in Lycra. At the taping we watch, Legend is sitting in the stands disguised as his own biggest fan for a sketch that had children (OK, and me) in hysterics.Afsar was the first ever hijabi to take part in the show. I love the diversity of Gladiators. Athena, powerlifter Karenjeet Kaur Bains, is Sikh. Fury is deaf. Viper is Chinese. Sabre is Scottish. There is a Gladiator for everyone – apart from, perhaps, the Welsh. Families of every hue fill the stands. There’s a timelessness to the spectacle. Mums shame themselves with lusty poster pitches (“You can spook me any time, Phantom!”), children rush to catch T-shirts shot into the audience with a cannon. If you’re ever thinking of watching Gladiators being filmed, I must warn you that it is an 11-hour day. But what a day. They let you in with a picnic and they only close the bar before the Eliminator.Bringing intergenerational joy is the best, Apollo says. “The biggest pat on the back we get is when we meet families and they say, ‘You’ve brought us back together … My kids didn’t want to watch anything with us, they’re stuck doing PlayStation or YouTube or whatever – this is the only thing they’ll sit down and watch with us.’Honestly, it’s amazing. It almost feels like I’m playing for England, it’s like the people’s show.”For me, Gladiators is the antidote to a cruel and senseless world. After being a reporter for 20 years, I’ve spent too much time in the darkness. Bring me sparkle! Bring me spandex! Bring me a gigantic Gladiator who can scoop me up and cradle me like a baby! I’ll paint you a poster if you make me a heart sign.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A global portrait of people and their rides, from Shanghai to Santa MonicaYou can tell a lot about someone from the vehicle they drive, as Martin Roemers’ collection of photographs show. Introduction by author William BoydWilliam BoydSat 10 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 16.47 ESTShareIn my novels I find that I very rarely write “a car” or “a van” or “a lorry” – I always tend to specify the marque and the model, often with some pedantic precision. Why should this be so? After all, I am a non-driver, someone who claims to be able to drive (I did learn), but who never passed his driving test. And yet, paradoxically, I’m something of a car enthusiast – a sort-of petrol-head, I confess – perhaps a consequence of spending many hours, or maybe that should be years,  in the back of minicabs that conveyed me here and there around London. In my long experience of minicab use I’ve found that most conversations with minicab drivers often end up being about cars. I’ve learned a lot.There is another reason why I like to specify. I have a conviction that the type of car, or vehicle, that you drive is as much an expression of your personality as the clothes you wear or the decor of the home you call your own. Even the blandest of mid-price cars – the Toyota Prius, the Kia Picanto, the Volkswagen Jetta, for example – are making a covert statement about you, the owner. You chose that car – and your choice is surprisingly eloquent.View image in fullscreenTailors Bhola and Akash in a Piaggio van in Nashik, Maharashtra, IndiaView image in fullscreenDrag queens Sasha and Brett with a Toyota in Santa Monica, California, USAll this is by way of a preamble to Martin Roemers’ Homo Mobilis, a remarkable series of photographs of people posed with the various vehicles they drive. Moreover, these photographs, I would claim, bear out the thesis that the car, the van, the lorry, and so forth, are an extension of, and a window to, their owner’s personality and, quite possibly, an indication of their value system as well.Roemers has ranged far and wide to photograph the various vehicles that catch his eye. Among the many countries he’s visited are the US, India, Ukraine, Senegal, the Czech Republic, China and the Netherlands. And the type of vehicle he photographs is equally eclectic – not just cars and trucks but also campervans, invalid trikes, handcarts and minibuses, people-carriers, ice-cream vans and tractors, road-rollers, donkey-carts, motorbikes and hearses. The variety of vehicles on display is astonishing but one’s eye is inevitably more drawn to the eccentric: the mud-splattered, multi-dented taxis, the rust-badged family saloons, the lurid paint-blistered lorries, the MOT-challenged, spavined minibuses.However, Roemers’ stroke of genius is to have removed the geographical and urban context of the vehicles in his photographs. Richard Avedon shot his famous 1985 series of portraits, In the American West, with the subjects seated in front of a completely neutral, starkly white backcloth. The effect was to concentrate all attention on the sitter. These human beings became entirely what they presented to the camera lens – there was no distraction, no prop or identifier beyond the features of their face and whatever items of clothing were visible. It was a uniquely desolate and unsettlingly graphic form of portraiture.View image in fullscreenSpecial forces lieutenant Maksym returning to Lviv, Ukraine, from the frontline in his ToyotaView image in fullscreenCourier Sanju in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, IndiaRoemers has cleverly adopted the same technique and has isolated his vehicles and their owners and passengers by erecting a huge white cloth backdrop draped over an armature of scaffolding and has parked the cars and trucks in front of it. The vans and lorries, three-wheeled scooters and autorickshaws look as if they’re stuck in some vast, empty snow-field. It’s the same Avedon-effect: all concentration is focused on the vehicle and its textures and patinas, its colours and contents, in a way that makes them seem more like an art installation or some form of bizarre modern sculpture. The fact that these images are, effectively and essentially, about modes of transport seems secondary. It’s the aesthetic dividend that resonates in these photographs. Never has a decrepit jalopy looked more intriguing, and, in a strange way, shot in this manner, it has become a beautiful object in its own right – its form suddenly separate from its mundane function.The one further observation I have is not so much a critique but a kind of compliment. Roemers’ unique vehicle photographs could run and run, as it were – the subject matter is almost infinite, after all – but one finds oneself wondering if the demographic could be extended. The cars, taxis and lorries in these photographs are largely owned by poorer, hard-working people as their scuffed and dilapidated means of transport testify. What would Roemers make of soccer-moms in their huge 4x4s? Or executive chauffeurs with their glossy Mercedes S-Class limos or 7 Series BMWs? Or well-heeled boy-racers with their Lamborghinis and Maseratis? Or cyclists with their bicycles? It’s a tribute to the complete success of this photographic enterprise that we can ask for more, please.The writer Stephen Bayley, in his book Death Drive, declared that: “Cars have a talismanic quality. No other manufactured object has the same disturbing allure. More emotions are involved in cars than in anything else we make or use.” Roemers’ work in Homo Mobilis establishes the truth of that statement and also that the allure of a given vehicle doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with price or design or exclusivity. “We are what we eat” is a tried and tested truism; these superb photographs establish that “we are whatever we drive” is just as valid..Homo Mobilis (Lannoo Publishers) is priced at £50.

He’s still alive in my house. My Christmas tree was David Bowie, even my bedding is Bowie,” she said.She travelled from Liverpool to join her fellow Bowie devotees at the Starman memorial in Brixton, southLondon, where the singer was born, to pay their respects on the anniversary of his death.Ten years after his death, is David Bowie’s musical legacy at risk of fading from view?Read moreThe gathering has become a site of annual pilgrimage for some, but this year larger than usual crowds amassed to mark 10 years since the artist’s passing.Hilton, 64, said she could recall the first time she came across Bowie when she was a child in Manchester.“He was on at the Free Trade Hall in 1972. I was just a kid and it was before he became famous with Ziggy. I just fell in love with him. I was 11 years old and awestruck. It was just like something you couldn’t imagine, the feeling of watching him. I was hooked ever since,” she said.View image in fullscreenDebbie Hilton.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianBowie’s death, which followed a liver cancer diagnosis about 18 months earlier, shocked the world. It was announced days after the release of his 26th and final album, Blackstar, which has since been interpreted as an expression of the artist’s impending mortality.‘A perplexing, astonishing finale’: world pays tribute to David Bowie a decade after his deathRead moreWhen Bowie died, Hilton said her brother sent her a text in the morning that said: “Are you OK?” She said: “I thought: ‘What’s he going on about?’ and then I put the TV on. Well, that was it. I couldn’t go to work for two weeks. I had lilies and a candle burning. I was crying and it went on for about a month. It was like losing everything in my life.”Julian Furnival braved the chilly weather to lay flowers at the mural. “It don’t matter what the weather is going to say, we’re always going to come here and pay our respects to him,” said the 68-year-old, who appeared emotional as he stuck stickers on the glass protecting the memorial.Furnival said he has been a Bowie fan since he received a copy of Aladdin Sane for Christmas when he was 13 years old. He still remembers the day when the Starman’s passing was announced. “It still rubs in pretty bad. Our niece phoned us up at 6.30am and said it happened. We didn’t believe it but then we turned the telly on. It was really upsetting. It was a big shock,” he said.View image in fullscreenJulian Furnival with Laura Hough.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianHis partner, Laura Hough, 69, has scrawled the names of fans from around the world on the memorial on their behalf. The couple have yet to listen to Blackstar. “We’ve never had the guts to play it all because my son says it’s a very solemn album,” said Furnival. Hough agrees: “Knowing he was in so much pain but still doing it, he’s just amazing.”Sisters Jenny Wasiak, 65, a train conductor who travelled to Brixton from Norwich, and Astrid Ballhorn, 74, who is retired, came to “spend the day doing all things Bowie to do what we can to remember and love him”.“We don’t like a lot of each other’s music but as far as David is concerned, he’s our favourite,” said Ballhorn. “We adore and love David and miss him dearly,” said Wasiak. “We came here the year he died.”View image in fullscreenJenny Wasiak and Astrid Ballhorn (right).Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianReflecting on his legacy, Wasiak described Blackstar as an “amazing” and “moving” parting gift. “He gave something to everybody, explaining that he’s dying. It was very moving and a brilliant piece of music as well,” she said.David Bowie’s childhood home to open to public after 1960s restorationRead more“He’s such an iconic legend who influenced everybody,” Ballhorn said.“If you listen to musicians speaking, they nearly all reference David in some way or another.”“I was listening to an interview the other day that compared him to Beethoven. He’s the Beethoven of our day. It’s a class of music that will live on for 200 years or more” she said. “It seems incredible to think that we lost him 10 years ago.“He was a genius, there’ll never be anybody else like him.”Explore more on these topicsDavid BowiePop and rockLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then I heard Michael Stipe’s lyrics and was set on a path to freedomPerry Bulwer; as told toKitty DrakeSat 10 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 06.15 ESTShareIn 1991, I was living in a commune with 200 other people in Japan, as a member of a cult called the Children of God, which preached that the world was going to end in 1993. Everything I did – from where I slept each night, to who I was allowed to sleep with – was decided by the head of my commune. I was encouraged to keep a diary, and then turn it over to the leaders every night, so they could comb through it for signs of dissent. I was only allowed to listen to cult-sanctioned music, and I was only allowed to watch movies with happy endings, because those were the types of films of which the cult’s supreme leader – David Berg – approved. The Sound of Music was one of Berg’s favourite films, so we watched it on repeat.By the time I was living in Japan, I was in my mid-30s, and I’d been part of the cult for 20 years. I was indoctrinated by a young hippy couple when I was 16, and persuaded to run away from my family and join a sect of the cult near my home town in Canada. I was a lonely teenager and desperately searching for some kind of meaning. Everybody I knew worked in the lumber mill in my small town, and the thought that I was doomed to live that life scared the hell out of me. The first time I visited the commune, everyone hugged me when I walked in, just to say “hello”. It was intoxicating.But by 1991, after two decades in the cult, my faith was weakening. It was becoming clearer to me that Berg was wrong about the world ending in 1993. A whole series of events that were meant to directly precede the Second Coming hadn’t happened, and Berg – who lived in secrecy and communicated with his followers by written “prophecies” – kept issuing increasingly unconvincing excuses.I was also becoming more resistant to the way the cult leaders sought to control the most intimate parts of my life. When I joined the cult, it was very sexually conservative. If you wanted to date another member of the community, you had to ask for permission from the leadership. But as the years went by, Berg started preaching a doctrine of sexual freedom, and ordering his members to couple-swap. I had got married to another cult member in the 1980s, and was living with her in a Children of God commune in Japan. Because I resisted couple-swapping I was forcibly separated from my wife as a punishment – and ordered to live in a different commune on my own.There was also an even darker side to the Children of God that I was trying to shut my eyes to. Berg had released a written decree which permitted adult cult members to have sex with children. I never witnessed any sexual contact with children, and while I did read that decree when it was released in the 1980s, I refused to accept it. Still, it horrified me.Forcibly separated from my wife, and with Berg’s teachings becoming more twisted, I was in a state of spiritual turmoil. But it was only when I heard REM’s song Losing My Religion that I was pushed to action. Cult members were allowed to own Walkmans, because the Children of God released their own music on cassette, but we were forbidden from listening to “worldly” music. As my will to blindly obey crumbled, I began to secretly tune in to the American armed forces radio station that broadcast in Japan. (Technically, I’d always had the power to covertly listen to music this way, but it’s a sign of how indoctrinated I was that I had never allowed myself to do so before.) One day, Losing My Religion came on, and I remember hearing it for the first time and freezing. I physically stopped walking.My cultural awakening: The Lehman Trilogy helped me to live with my sight lossRead moreIt was that lyric, ”That’s me in the spotlight / Losing my religion”, that shook me. Hearing that line was the first time I’d even had words for what was happening to me. Then I heard the lyric, “Every whisper of every waking hour / I’m choosing my confessions”, and I began to think about the way the leaders made us write those daily diaries of our feelings, and then hand them over for inspection. I had learned to self-censor, because I was afraid that expressing my real feelings and doubts would result in punishment. I had been “choosing my confessions” for many years.In 1991, Losing My Religion was a brand new song and the radio station had it on heavy rotation. Every day I’d go on my walk and hear it again, and at first, it made me terrified. I was a 36-year-old high school dropout with no possessions, and I had nothing to go back to. You had to turn all your money over to the cult, so I had barely anything to my name. But with every re-listen, I became more determined to leave. It took me about five months, but I finally escaped the commune in the autumn of 1991. I moved back in with my parents, and ended up training to become a lawyer, but I have remained haunted by my decades with the cult. I’ve spent my career advocating for the children who were abused by Berg and some of his followers.A few years ago, I was surprised to learn that according to REM frontman Michael Stipe, Losing My Religion isn’t about someone losing faith at all; it’s about unrequited love. He explained that the phrase is a common expression in the American south “meaning to lose one’s temper or civility, or to feel frustrated and desperate”. However, like poetry, songs are open to the interpretation of listeners who apply their own meanings to the lyrics. I applied that song to my own life and everything changed.Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Paul Thomas Anderson’s idiosyncratic activism caperOne Battle After Anotherhas so far dominated, becoming only the fourth film ever to win best film at both the New York and Los Angeles film circles then the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. But how far can it go?One awards battle after another: A-listers face off at this year’s Golden GlobesRead moreIt leads this weekend’sGolden Globeswith nine nominations but the comedy categories also feature Marty Supreme, now riding high at the box office, and its inescapable leading man Timothée Chalamet. Then on the drama side we have Sinners and Hamnet, two very different films solidifying two very different awards narratives. Here’s how I think it might all play out on Sunday:Best film (drama)View image in fullscreenMichael B Jordan and Miles Caton in Sinners.Photograph: Warner Bros Entertainment Inc/PAThe belated attempts to add some diversity to the Globes voting pool have been slowly paying off with this year’s major drama category boasting three films in a foreign language, two from Latino directors, one from a Black director, one from a Middle Eastern director and one directed by an Asian woman. Unlike the category-filling days of films like The Great Debaters or Bobby, each film here is enough of a contender to also make the Oscars big 10, making it slightly harder to predict. Frankenstein is perhaps the least likely, a film respected for its craft but perhaps not as loved for its emotional connection, while Sentimental Value is perhaps the opposite yet could be too modest to win. There’s growing buzz for It Was Just an Accident and The Secret Agent, both timely tales of pushing back against oppressive forces, but I think this is going to be a race between Hamnet andSinners. Sinners has the popular vote (and is the far better film in my opinion) but Hamnet is the more traditional Globes winner and any recent backlash, from those who see it as shameless Oscarbait, has perhaps not had as much impact offline. It’s going to be tight and while I do fear a season of Sinners unfairly being the bridesmaid I think the extra heat from this week’s Actor award noms (with surprise nods for Miles Caton and Wunmi Mosaku) shows there’s still a great deal of momentum that will push it to a win this Sunday.Will win:SinnersShould win:SinnersShoulda been nominated:LurkerBest female actor (drama)View image in fullscreenJessie Buckley, center, in Hamnet.Photograph: Agata Grzybowska/APWhile it might have felt that the buzz had cooled on Hamnet’s Jessie Buckley for a minute, with Rose Byrne winning the majority of early awards, it was more the case of the film being more suited to the bigger voting bodies. Like, say, Oppenheimer, this was never going to be as beloved by the critics circles but after her win at last weekend’s Critics Choice awards, expect first-time nominee Buckley to easily take this one. There’s little competition from surprise entrants like Sorry, Baby’s Eva Victor and Hedda’s Tessa Thompson and while a perfectly chilly Julia Roberts makes the most of the sorry old mess that is After the Hunt, the three-time winner is not even in the race. The Globes also love Die My Love’s Jennifer Lawrence but the film hasn’t been as easy to get behind while Sentimental Value’s Renate Reinsve is arguably Buckley’s closest competition but the distance between them is considerable. Given that even naysayers ofHamnethave praised the tearjerking finale, and that so much of that rests on Buckley’s face, I can’t see her losing this one.Will win:Jessie Buckley (Hamnet)Should win:Julia Roberts (After the Hunt)Shoulda been nominated:Rebecca Hall (Peter Hujar’s Day)Best male actor (drama)View image in fullscreenWagner Moura in The Secret Agent.Photograph: APNot an easy category to predict this time around (unlike last year when Adrien Brody was the obvious choice) and there are maybe two potential outcomes right now. Unlikely to factor into the race is Netflix, first they have Train Dreams’ Joel Edgerton and I think the film and his performance are a little too quiet to make enough noise while Frankenstein’s Oscar Isaac is the most category-filling inclusion of the lot given how any awards heat that film is gaining is related more to craft and the performance of Jacob Elordi. Then there are the two biopic nods and I think the season has cooled on both The Smashing Machine’s Dwayne Johnson and Deliver Me From Nowhere’s Jeremy Allen White. Which leads us to the two less traditionally Globes yet undeniably more persuasive choices. Michael B Jordan, who gives two commanding performances in Sinners (one could argue three after one of the twins is turned into a vampire), could become only the sixth Black actor to triumph in this category, the star appearing in almost every scene of the film. Or I could see Wagner Moura riding the critical wave to a win for The Secret Agent, after awards at Cannes and the New York film critics circle. It all depends on whether voters are going for a big-budget studio blockbuster (albeit made with unusual personality) or an offbeat foreign language indie. I think in this category, Moura might have it but it’ll be close.Will win:Wagner Moura (The Secret Agent)Should win:Michael B Jordan (Sinners)Shoulda been nominated: David Strathairn (A Little Prayer)Best film (comedy or musical)View image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio in One Battle After Another.Photograph: APThis used to be something of a joke category, allowing full-blown duds like Burlesque and The Tourist to call themselves “Golden Globe-nominated” but in recent years it’s often been as competitive as drama. This year feels more clearcut than usual with One Battle After Another almost certain to triumph, given how it’s the most nominated film of the night and has picked up pretty much every precursor so far this season. The closest competition would probably be Marty Supreme, which benefits from a later release and some box office success (it’s likely to outgross One Battle in the US), but it’s more pegged to a particular performance and feels like less of a well-rounded choice. Elsewhere, Blue Moon is similarly more of a performance pick, Bugonia will probably be too offbeat while Nouvelle Vague and No Other Choice both show impressive international progress for comedies at the Globes (there have only been three other foreign language films in this category since 2010) but neither has strong enough momentum. One Battle After Another has this one in the bag.Will win:One Battle After AnotherShould win:One Battle After AnotherShoulda been nominated:TwinlessBest female actor (comedy or musical)View image in fullscreenRose Byrne in If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockAnother strong year for this category (2025 saw Demi Moore beat eventual Oscar winner Mikey Madison and fellow nominees Cynthia Erivo and Karla Sofía Gascón) which features only one actor who hasn’t been nominated for a Golden Globe before. That would be One Battle After Another’s Chase Infiniti whose impressive performance still might not be themostmemorable in a film of many (the film’s best awards chances are arguably in the supporting categories). She’s likely to join Bugonia’s Emma Stone, Song Sung Blue’s Kate Hudson, The Testament of Ann Lee’s Amanda Seyfried and Wicked: For Good’s Cynthia Erivo on the sidelines with what seems like a clear winner leading the pack. A film like If I Had Legs, I’d Kick You might have seemed too weird to be an awards contender a decade ago (it’s still too weird to break into the comedy/musical category by itself) but the landscape has changed considerably since then and Rose Byrne’s career-topping work has already nabbed her almost all of the early awards. It also doesn’t hurt that, like Moore last year, she is still a glamorous Globes-friendly star and if she wins here, she’ll be Buckley’s biggest competition for the Oscar.Will win:Rose Byrne (If I Had Legs, I’d Kick You)Should win:Rose Byrne (If I Had Legs, I’d Kick You)Shoulda been nominated:Kirsten Dunst (Roofman)Best male actor (comedy or musical)View image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet in Marty Supreme.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyAs with the comedy/musical film category, this is likely to be down to two contenders. Ethan Hawke’s Blue Moon nod is well earned (he’s the best in the category for me) while Bugonia’s Jesse Plemons and No Other Choice’s Lee Byung-hun are far more than category-fillers (as a reminder Saturday Night’s Gabriel LaBelle was nominated last year) and, well, the less said about Jay Kelly’s George Clooney and the total nothingness of that film, the better. So it’s down to old hand Leonardo DiCaprio and young gun Timothée Chalamet to battle it out. As incredibly funny as DiCaprio is in One Battle After Another (for me, he gives the better comedic turn of the two), it’s undoubtedly going to be the first win for Chalamet (he’s racked up an impressive five nods since 2018). The Globes is kinder to younger male talent than the Oscars (recent non-Oscar winners have included Austin Butler, Chadwick Boseman, Sebastian Stan, Andrew Garfield and Taron Egerton) and while his role as Bob Dylan was politely received, the praise heaped on his turn as Marty Mauser is on a different level. Plus it gives the celeb-hungry Globes telecast an excuse to feature even more shots of Kylie Jenner …Will win:Timothée Chalamet (Marty Supreme)Should win:Ethan Hawke (Blue Moon)Shoulda been nominated:Dylan O’Brien (Twinless)Best female supporting actorView image in fullscreenAmy Madigan in Weapons.Photograph: Warner BrosAn unusual category here with an actor nominated for a role she’s already been nominated for (Ariana Grande for Wicked: For Good), two actors from the same film who are speaking in different languages (Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas for Sentimental Value), a character actor playing a witch in a horror (Amy Madigan in Weapons), a singer and one-time reality star as a political revolutionary (Teyana Taylor in One Battle After Another) and, well, Emily Blunt for The Smashing Machine, only unusual perhaps for how unworthy that performance is. I think it’ll be down to Madigan and Taylor, both giving big, all-guns-blazing turns in big studio movies. Madigan won at both the New York film critics circle and the Critics Choice awards so it’s clear she has major support but I think Taylor, giving arguably the most indelible performance in the night’s most nominated film could also take it. It’s a tough call but I think Madigan’s terrifyingly transformative Aunt Gladys has it.Will win:Amy Madigan (Weapons)Should win:Amy Madigan (Weapons)Shoulda been nominated:Wunmi Mosaku (Sinners)Best male supporting actorView image in fullscreenJacob Elordi in Frankenstein.Photograph: APAt a distance, this could seem like a battle between two extremely different performances from two Oscar winners in One Battle After Another, the good of Benicio del Toro and the very bad of Sean Penn. Del Toro has been the more awarded of the two so far with multiple critics circle wins (although my personal pick would be Penn) but I could see the Globes ignoring them both, a problem some films often have with two performers in the same category essentially cancelling the other one out. I don’t think there’s much of a threat from Hamnet’s Paul Mescal, who fades into the background in the movie for Buckley, and I can’t see Adam Sandler winning for Jay Kelly, a film that hasn’t secured enough love since its mixed Venice premiere. There’s reason to believe that Stellan Skarsgård could win for what many see as his career-best work in Sentimental Value especially as the film is also directly about the industry. But I think it’s Frankenstein’s Jacob Elordi who will run away with this one. He won at last week’s Critics Choice awards and it’s the kind of big, unrecognisably different turn that voters have always loved (he’s also the best performer in a film that’s otherwise a little shaky acting-wise). Plus he’s a young, handsome actor and in a category that once awarded the otherwise totally out of the race Aaron Taylor-Johnson for Nocturnal Animals, it would feel like a very old school Globes win.Will win:Jacob Elordi (Frankenstein)Should win:Sean Penn (One Battle After Another)Shoulda been nominated:Miles Caton (Sinners)Best directorView image in fullscreenRegina Hall in One Battle After Another.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyA category here that’s made up of film-makers from five drama nominees and one comedy (sorry to The Secret Agent’s Kleber Mendonça Filho as the one drama snub) and one that’s also likely to be a rare comedy win (the last non-drama winner was Damien Chazelle for La La Land in 2017 and that was very much a musical). Chlé Zhao took this award home for Nomadland back in 2021 but Hamnet feels more performance-led while the same could also be said for Joachim Trier’s Sentimental Value. I think Guillermo del Toro is the category-filler here for Frankenstein, a film that for me is one of his worst. There’s a world where the very deserving Jafar Panahi could also make for a bold statement win for It Was Just an Accident, a film that’s both a propulsive thriller and a brave act of defiance. But I think it will come down to Ryan Coogler for Sinner and Paul Thomas Anderson for One Battle After Another, both bold auteurist epics. I think Anderson will ultimately win out, the film is the most nominated of the night and a juggernaut already this season, and it would make for his first Golden Globe.Will win:Paul Thomas Anderson (One Battle After Another)Should win:Paul Thomas Anderson (One Battle After Another)Shoulda been nominated:Michael Angelo Covino (Splitsville)Explore more on these topicsGolden Globes 2026Golden GlobesOne Battle After AnotherHamnetSinnersAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What can we learn from their prophecies?Joanna KavennaSat 10 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTShareThis year marks 100 years since the first demonstration of television in London. Elizabeth II sent the first royal email in 1976. The first meeting of the Lancashire Association of Change Ringers took place in 1876. All notable anniversaries. But I’m going with 2026 as the 85th anniversary of a great short story:Jorge Luis Borges’s The Garden of Forking Paths (1941). It’s about chance, labyrinths and an impossible novel. Ts’ui Pên, an ancestor of the narrator, sets himself the task of writing a novel with a cast of thousands:“an enormous guessing game, or parable, in which the subject is time”. In most novels, when a character reaches a fork in the path, they must choose: this way, or that way. Yet in Ts’ui Pên’s novel, all possible paths are chosen. This creates “a growing, dizzying web of divergent, convergent, and parallel times”. The garden of forking paths is infinite.It’s often said that Borges’s story foreshadows the multiverse hypothesis in quantum physics – first proposed by Hugh Everett in 1957, then popularised by Bryce DeWitt in the 1970s as the “many worlds interpretation” of quantum mechanics. In a 2005 essay, The Garden of the Forking Worlds, the physicist Alberto Rojo investigated this claim. Did the physicists read Borges? Or did Borges read the universe? It turned out that Bryce DeWitt hadn’t known about Borges’s garden. When Rojo questioned Borges, he also denied everything: “This is really curious,” he said, “because the only thing I know about physics comes from my father, who once showed me how a barometer works.” He added: “Physicists are so imaginative!”As Rojo’s mock-inquiry demonstrates, fictional foreshadowing is a strange art. We don’t live in Borges’s garden, so it’s impossible to go back in time, splice the universe and ascertain what happens if Borges never writes about splicing the universe. Would Everett still propose his universe-splicing theory? The universe is mysterious; so is the interplay of cause and effect. HG Wells’s 1914 futuristic novel The World Set Free portrays the devastating effects of compact “atomic bombs”. The physicist Leo Szilard read Wells’s novel in 1932 and conceived the nuclear chain reaction in 1933. We can’t enter a parallel world wherein Wells thrives as a draper’s apprentice, stops writing and becomes the distinguished manager of Hyde’s Drapery Emporium in Southsea. Yet, one line of influence is clear. When Szilard realised the significance of his theory, he felt afraid: “Knowing what it would mean – and I knew because I had readHG Wells.”The future is an uncharted territory, a place beyond maps. This affords writers a certain imaginative freedom: to create dystopias, utopias, experiments and imaginary societies. In Begum Rokeya’s Sultana’s Dream (1905) – which appeared a decade before Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland–a traveller ventures into a matriarchal hi-tech society where hard labour is done “by electricity”, it’s easy to cook and transport options include a sort of hydrogen helicopter. Marge Piercy’s 1976 novel Woman on the Edge of Time considers both utopian and dystopian futures: a peaceful rural commune versus a torrid hyper-capitalist city where the rich extend their lifespans as the poor struggle to survive. The suggestion of Piercy’s novel is that these futures slide in and out of existence, responsive to events in the present. Or perhaps they only exist in the mind of the protagonist. Octavia E Butler’s 1993 Parable of the Sower and 1998 Parable of the Talents are set in a post-apocalyptic California. Once again the wealthy immure themselves against dystopia, sequestered in fortified communities. The climate is wrecked; people long for the good old days. A nefarious president swears he will “Make America Great Again” – looking backwards to Reagan, forwards to Maga. Butler describes her characters in a state of surreal detachment; their climate apocalypse feels “old hat in science fiction”. This sense of reality as implausible, eerily akin to meta-fiction, foreshadows our own ironic-dystopian present.View image in fullscreenFictional foreshadowing … Tom Cruise in Minority Report (2002)Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyThen there are the writers who predicted our surveillance society: Yevgeny Zamyatin in We (English translation published in 1924), Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1932) and George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). These novels are so absurdly relevant to our age of surveillance capitalism that it seems our tech barons have used them not as satirical warnings but as motivational texts. In all three futuristic societies, an ideological super-state prohibits any form of privacy. Solitude is mistrusted because it encourages contemplation and possible independence of thought. Even the privacy of the inner mind is – wherever possible – violated. A successor to these novels is Margaret Atwood’s 1985 The Handmaid’s Tale, another prescient story of mass surveillance and the control of women’s bodies by reactionary governments. Meanwhile, Atwood’s MaddAdamtrilogy (Oryx and Crake, 2003; The Year of the Flood, 2009; MaddAdam, 2013) foregrounds ethical dilemmas concerning bioengineering, pandemics and monopolistic corporations.In Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel Snow Crash,the “metaverse” is an immersive virtual reality, requiring a headset. In 2021, Mark Zuckerberg famously rebranded the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp as Meta and stated his intention to develop a “metaverse”. William Gibson’s 1984 novel Neuromancer imagined a VR-scape called the Matrix.This novel brought the term “cyberspace” into, well, cyberspace (and beyond). In Philip K Dick’s The Minority Report (1956), pre-crime units employ psychics to predict future crimes so the police can make preemptive arrests. What happens, Dick asks, if a crime is predicted but the future malefactor changes their mind? Are they still pre-guilty? Fast-forward to our present and, yes, pre-crime operations are being trialled across the UK. No psychics required; oracular law enforcement agencies use data mining, predictive algorithms and facial recognition instead. What could possibly go wrong?Finally, there is Dick’s endlessly helpful idea of “kipple”, coined in his 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. For Dick, “Kipple is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers.” The first law of kipple is that “it drives out nonkipple”. You can’t win against kipple, “except temporarily and maybe in one spot”. Kipple is now all the algo-rubbish online, our bulging inboxes, the AI slop. Could Dick have predicted this? Can some prescient novelists really see the future?Future fictions are, as Atwood has said, really deep examinations of the present. From there, as Borges shows, it’s an enormous guessing game. Some guesses at the future are better than others. Some are strangely brilliant. Could Dick have envisioned, all the way back in the 1960s, a world where humans would be swamped by the flotsam and jetsam of modern life – or was he really writing about overwhelm in his own present moment? Either way, his advice still applies, both prescient and inspiring: maybe all we can do is find a balance between the pressures of kipple and nonkipple – the useless junk and the objects of value. When the tech barons have taken the dystopias for utopias, perhaps this is as utopian as it gets.

Plus: a fresh new look for Casualty on its 40th anniversary. Here’s what to watch this eveningHollie Richardson,Jack Seale,Graeme VirtueandSimon WardellSat 10 Jan 2026 01.15 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 01.17 ESTShareHeated Rivalry9pm, Sky AtlanticIt’s the horny ice hockey drama that has left Canadian and US audiences gasping for air. Based on Rachel Reid’s smash-hit novel, the steamy story follows the relationship between Major League Hockey rivals Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie). Each is dealing with personal demons when they meet ahead of their first match – a moment that triggers an undeniable magnetic pull between the pair. They start a secret fling in between games and press conferences, but it soon grows into a journey of yearning, love, ambition, denial and self-discovery. Even if you’re not a hockey fan, this is one hell of a spectator sport.Hollie RichardsonCasualty8.45pm, BBC OneView image in fullscreenHot shot … new doctor Kim (Jasmine Bayes) in Casualty.Photograph: BBC STUDIOSAfter a short hiatus, Casualty is back with a chaotic revamp to mark its 40th anniversary. It’s the hottest day of the year and, much to the A&E team’s exasperation, two new doctors are joining the department. Quirky Kim (Jasmine Bayes) is welcomed with a patient’s bowl of vomit, while charming Matty (Aron Julius) gets a little too involved in a case. Will they turn things round by the end of an action-packed shift?HRThe Masked Singer7pm, ITV1The first two celebrities have revealed themselves: Disc Jockey was Alex Jones and Teabag was Professor Green. This week’s round is a sports day-themed special, with cricketing hero Freddie Flintoff joining as a guest judge. Will Sloth, Can of Worms and the rest bowl him over?HRValley of the Kings: Secret Tomb Revealed7pm, Channel 4German archaeologist Dr Anke Weber and her team excavate the inside of the massive burial chamber of Pharaoh Ramses III, on the hunt for 3,000-year-old treasure. But this two-part documentary isn’t just a case of searching for pleasing trinkets. The dig finds evidence that throws new light both on Ramses’s assassination and the activities of fabled 20th-century Egyptologist Howard Carter.Jack SealeWaiting for the Out9.35pm, BBC OneDennis Kelly’s hard-edged but cathartic prison drama continues, with puppyish philosopher Dan (Josh Finan) encouraging his class of inmates to think about luck. Will those lessons help when an arthouse cinema trip with his streetwise older brother Lee (Stephen Wight) becomes something rather more fraught?Graeme VirtueThe Hunting Wives11.25pm, ITV1Who shot Abby Jackson? What started as a sexy Texas housewives satire is now a full-blown whodunnit. Sophie (Brittany Snow) may own the gun that shot the fatal bullet, but there’s a whole line of suspects – including her new friends and their ringleader Margo (Malin Akerman), who was getting intimate with Sophie on the night of the murder.HRFilm choiceThe Gunfighter, 2.50pm, Great! ActionJimmy Ringo is the fastest gun in the American south-west of the 1880s. But with notoriety comes peril because – as Gregory Peck’s ageing sharpshooter has found – there’s a “squirt” in every town angling to challenge him. Henry King’s tense 1950 western is about how the weight of a legend can drag a man down – but weary Ringo hopes to avoid that when he rides into Cayenne seeking to revive his relationship with teacher Peggy (Helen Westcott) and their young son. However, like all good Greek tragedies, the more he tries to flee his fate the closer it gets.Simon WardellCool Hand Luke, 5.50pm, Sky Cinema GreatsView image in fullscreen‘Gloriously sweat-soaked’ … Cool Hand Luke on Sky Cinema Greats.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyThere are definite Christ-like overtones to the titular chain-gang convict in Stuart Rosenberg’s gloriously sweat-soaked, dirt-engrained drama. An individual in a system that will not tolerate difference, Lucas Jackson (Paul Newman) is the charismatic newcomer who wins over his fellow inmates with an aptitude for taking a beating, trying to escape and eating boiled eggs (a scene that is worth watching the film for alone). Newman oozes star quality as we witness a prison myth in the act of being created.SWA Few Good Men, 10.35pm, Channel 4If you fancy paying tribute to the late Rob Reiner, you could do worse than his 1992 legal thriller. Aside from the sharp tacks and jibes of Aaron Sorkin’s script, there is the pleasure of watching Hollywood’s new and old guard in close combat. Tom Cruise plays a cocky young navy lawyer who teams up with Demi Moore’s fellow litigator to defend two Guantánamo Bay marines accused of murder. Unspoken military codes and delusions of honour impede their case, with Jack Nicholson’s imperious base commander the big beast they must defeat.SWLive sportWomen’s Super League Football: Arsenal v Man United, 11.30am, Sky Sports Main EventMan City v Everton is on Sun at 11am.Men’s FA Cup Football: Macclesfield v Crystal Palace, noon, BBC One/TNT Sports 1The third-round tie at Leasing.com Stadium.

But it’s far more than just a porny sport-based bodice-ripperRhik SamadderSat 10 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTShareIwas surprised to learn that ice hockey romance is a genre, a popular one. Surprising, but it makes sense. Love in a cold setting has a fairytale quality. It’s why the great Russian romances endure, though they aren’t relatable. Most of us don’t sit by windows, waiting for a horse to bring word that our cousin has survived the winter in Smolensk. Perhaps it’s time for a modern Doctor Zhivago? EnterHeated Rivalry(Saturday 10 January, 9pm, Sky Atlantic), a Canadian queer romp so hot it threatens to scorch the ice it skates upon.Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov are star players from Montreal and Moscow respectively, mysteriously drawn to each other on the rink, in the full glare of the media. Well, not that mysteriously. The co-leads get down to business almost immediately, with a not-quite meet cute in a shower room. Every episode thereafter features charged glances, sweaty necks and muscular pumping. Even the camera feels as if it’s in lust, gliding over 8%-fat sports star bodies and the glass walls of luxury flats. It’s an audacious feat, making ice hockey sexy. Those padded uniforms usually make wearers resemble the Thing from The Fantastic Four.It helps that the actors are ravishing. Regardless of which team you play for, Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie draw the eye. The latter (who does a good job with the accent) looks like Michelangelo’s David, with a derriere like a brace of pneumatic hams. Together, they’re uncannily reminiscent of Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in Point Break. No wonder the show, created for Canadian streamer, ah, Crave, has become a runaway success in the US, with clips popping up all over a perma-thirsty social media.Heated Rivalry is not just a porny hockey bodice-ripper; it’s an interesting premise. Sport is a repressively macho arena, and Rozanov’s home country, Russia, hardly heaven for queer people. He’s a libertarian, who loves the club and hotties, but has family struggles he can’t share. Squeaky clean Asian-Canadian Hollander, meanwhile, is a study in self-sacrifice. Eating “bird food” and protecting sponsorship deals, he’s cripplingly aware of how a rumour mill can grind down a personal brand. We’re reminded of the cost of fame, and why young stars might sacrifice love for ambition.Like the arrogant Rozanov, the show knows why you came. It’s serving fan-fic, incognito browser, stag party-experimentation raunch. It’s not explicit, though, and while the sex scenes are bold, they aren’t gratuitous. It’s refreshing. Risk-averse studios have in recent years responded to changing audience tastes by taking sex out of shows and films altogether, even romances. That’s just silly. What people want is better sex: more diverse scenes, which serve storytelling, reveal character and illustrate a specific connection.‘No one can know’: Heated Rivalry’s gay love story exposes ice hockey’s culture of silenceRead moreHeated Rivalry (like its BBC stablemateIndustry) gets it. Rozanov and Hollander’s intimate acts are power plays that track their attitudes to experience, aggression and risk. They reflect or complicate the couple’s standing on the public stage, in ways that can be wounding or tender. They’re bold, complex, unsteadily evolving. Everything you want from a good situationship.The public enemies, separated by country, can only meet around matches, shoots and award ceremonies. There’s a sweetness to the way they sext between locker rooms, against Hollander’s better judgment. “See you next season” becomes their bittersweet refrain. This distance gives their story the shape of a classic romance, trembling in hockey pads.Will there be a fairytale ending, or is this another onscreen gay story that ends in trauma and heartbreak? You’ll have to watch. As the story progresses over years, it reveals unexpected depth and humour, though. It should be a star vehicle for Storrie, enjoying his Slavic deadpan to the utmost. “Never in my life have I blushed. Russians do not do this” is a great line. It’s bested only by the impassioned moment in which he declares “I’m coming to the cottage!” which sounds bananas.Heated Rivalry may not be Doctor Zhivago, but it has shades of Challengers, Brokeback Mountain, even Rocky IV. I’m not sure a higher compliment exists. There was one downside to watching perfect bodies engaged in athletic coupling: a withering analysis of my own erotic performance, internalised as the voice of Roy Keane. If January’s cold weather and comfort eating have given you low self-esteem, beware. Baby, it’s cold outside, but it’s no picnic inside, either.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Add songs, many of Bruce Springsteen’s in this case, along with a few rounds of line dancing and a sizzling star in Billy Crudup. Still, it’s an odd experience initially as Thea Sharrock’s production switches from one brief filmic scene to the next, and the endeavour seems as wooden as the clapboard saloon-bar slats that comprise the handsome set.As a piece of theatre, it finds its flow. As a debate play, though, it gathers a locomotive energy as it travels towards the showdown between Frank Miller (James Doherty), who is returning to this “dirty little village in the middle of nowhere”, and the marshal Will Kane (Crudup) who put him behind bars. That is mostly because of the uncanny and urgent relevance of this 1952 film about a community working out (or rather, squirming out of) its civic responsibilities around institutional wrongdoing.Originally an allegory of McCarthyism (its screenwriter, Carl Foreman, was blacklisted), the story sets the cowardice of the many against the courage of the few – in this case, the lone, heroic Kane, who mobilises his defence against Miller and his henchmen after being let down by the townsfolk. The film was blasted by John Wayne as un-American for its critical portrait of the community; the production comes to life in its arguments on collective in/action and seems to speak directly about the dilemmas facing the cowboy country of Trump’s America (theshooting in Minneapolisjust the latest example). Eric Roth’s script uses many lines from Foreman’s screenplay but fleshes out the debates on the ethical stance of a community in the face of wrongdoing and misguided American myths around immigration.View image in fullscreenCowardice of the many, courage of the few … cast of High Noon.Photograph: Johan PerssonThere is also the joint talent of Crudup and the ever agileDenise Goughwho play the central couple on their wedding day. She is Amy Fowler, a Quaker who abhors the actions of violent men; he is the marshal who has just given up his “tin star” to start over as a shopkeeper. That is, until news reaches town that Miller is arriving on the noon train.Gary Cooper made the role entirely his own, his integrity comparable only to Gregory Peck’s Atticus in To Kill a Mockingbird. So Crudup has his long shadow to evade. He manages to hold up the part on stage as an upstanding, earnest and increasingly desperate man. Gough makes her part grittier and more modern than that of her film counterpart, Grace Kelly. The pair are convincing as a couple although their narrow characterisation hems in the full scale of their abilities.‘Pinnacle of westerns’: the Oscar-winning writer of Forrest Gump on staging High Noon – with songs by SpringsteenRead moreSeveral other characters seem too flimsy, from Billy Howle’s deputy marshal, Harvey Pell, to Rosa Salazar’s Mexican businesswoman, Helen, although the affinity between her and Amy is refreshing, and Roth gives more voice and texture to these women as a whole.Several of Springsteen’s songs bring their own American politics (from the frontier optimism of Land of Hope and Dreams to The Rising, written in response to 9/11). Some are sung a cappella, mostly by Gough, who is a strong singer, her voice emanating desolation, but she reprises I’m on Fire one too many times.It seems like a reluctant musical at times, the songs short and thin but the percussive music and sound design are always arresting, as is the lighting, designed by Neil Austin, which brings emotional clarity and intrigue. A clock is central to Tim Hatley’s set design, counting down to the train’s thrilling arrival and the subsequent showdown, which manages to contain tension and drama, despite the difficulty of staging a cross-town shootout.For all its early stiffness, it builds in momentum and there are moving moments. Ultimately, the political message speaks loudest, harnessing the McCarthyist fear of then and the Trumpian terror of today.At theHarold Pinter theatre, London, until 6 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreWesternsDenise GoughWest EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

Anders Hillborg took the principle as inspiration for his composition Exquisite Corpse but, where the surrealists hoped for signs of an unconscious collective sensibility, the emerging components of Hillborg’s piece bear his consciously singular imprint while also incorporating references to composers as disparate as Stravinsky, Ligeti and Sibelius.In the performance given by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under their chief conductorRyan Bancroft, the unfolding layers of sound were never less than brilliantly alive. Hillborg’s instinct for a remarkable range of instrumental colour – delicate tendrils of harmony, monstrously growling bass registers, insistent conga drumming, shrill piccolos – taunted and teased the ear before finally fading into a gentle haze.Sibelius’s Lemminkäinen Suite Op 22 made for an intriguing and blackly surreal connection, since in the Swan of Tuonela – second of the sequence of four tone poems based on episodes from the Kalevala, Finland’s national epic – the shamanic demigod hero Lemminkäinen is killed and his body dismembered. This exquisite corpse is then lovingly restored to life by his mother so that he can return home in triumph. Eliciting very fine string playing, with Amy McKean’s cor anglais solo most evocative, Bancroft found a balance between the narrative drama and the intoxicating, elemental quality of Sibelius’ score, while also creating a positively symphonic overall trajectory.Between these two works came Shostakovich’s Cello Concerto No 2, Op 126 in G major in which the soloist was the magnificent Alban Gerhardt. In his hands, it was the music’s melancholy beauty rather than the implicitly tragic vein that came across so hauntingly, the writing high on the A string impeccably delivered, and, in the Allegretto movement, Shostakovich’s bleakly sardonic rhythmic bite precision-honed. After such an intense experience, nothing was more heartwarming than seeing Gerhardt, modest cello-hero, join the back of the cello section to play in the Sibelius suite. Just for the hell of it.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC National Orchestra of WalesWalesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The main town is beautiful, with buildings leading up a hill to an old castle. We rented a small apartment and spent our days on quiet pebble beaches that we had almost to ourselves. It’s a genuinely peaceful place where you can properly switch off from the noise of modern life.RoyA Corsican beach that never gets busyView image in fullscreenPlage de Péru.Photograph: Jon Ingall/AlamyOur favourite beach in Europe is Plage de Péru on Corsica. It can be reached by a pleasant downhill walk from the village of Cargèse, established by descendants of Greek immigrants from the Mani peninsula in the 18th century. However, we were lucky enough to have direct access from theHotel Thalassa, a sleepy hotel with balconies and a leafy garden facing the turquoise waters. There may be better beaches on Corsica but this one is perfect for swimming and never seems to get busy. You can spend a day walking from the beach to the local Genoese tower, then return and grab a seat at one of the beachpailotteswhere you can eat and drink while watching the sunset.EleanorHot sand and siestas in CataloniaView image in fullscreenPlaya el Morer, Sant Pol de Mar, near Barcelona.Photograph: Maria Jose Furio/AlamyThe train from Barcelona deposits its passengers right on Sant Pol de Mar’s harbour. The sound of gently bobbing rigging and the whiff of seafood drifts from the village, where the promise of a splendid lunch awaits. The Playa el Morer is reached on foot along a curving bay where frazzled city dwellers dig their heels in that hot, amber sand, and take a siesta and the occasional dip. Sant Pol, it seems, exists to mend broken hearts and heal the soul.LizTimeless charm in Akyaka, TurkeyView image in fullscreenA hotel on a crystal clear river in Akyaka.Photograph: AlamyOn a road trip through Turkey’s south-west, I stumbled upon Akyaka, a peaceful, pine-fringed village untouched by mass tourism. The Azmak River, so clear it seemed unreal, flowed past riverside cafes where I watched turtles drift by. Locals welcomed me like family and evenings meant fresh seafood and golden sunsets. The architecture – wooden houses with carved balconies – gave the town a timeless charm. Paddleboarding on the calm sea at sunrise was something I’ll never forget.DebbieStay cool on the Danish RivieraView image in fullscreenGilleleje, North Zealand.Photograph: Niels Quist/AlamyWho needs the scorching Med when you have the Danish Riviera. The water is clean and refreshing (no wetsuits allowed – you’ll be laughed off the beach). Danish summer hols are in July, so you’ll have the beach to yourself in August. Book a summer cottage near Gilleleje, a charming fishing village about an hour from Copenhagen. Denmark is expensive, so self-catering is best. Ice-cream at Hansens; lunch in Gilleleje harbour; culture atLouisiana modern art museumandHamlet’s Castlein Helsingør.ChristinaA quieter alternative to Capri, ItalyView image in fullscreenLa Corricella harbour in Procida.Photograph: Francesco Riccardo Iacomino/Getty ImagesProcida, in the Bay of Naples, is not as famous as nearby Capri and Ischia, but is all the more appealing for it. Not a tourist trap but an island where people actually live, it’s a delightful slice of unhurried Italian life. It’s small enough to explore on foot or by bicycle, and there is a bus service too. There are many pretty little beaches for swimming, sunbathing and picnicking – our favourite was Il Postino, where scenes from the movie of the same name were filmed. As people still fish for a living, there’s no shortage of wonderfully fresh seafood in the restaurants.Villa CaterinaB&B’s orchard of lemon and orange trees provides fresh juice and marmalade for breakfast, and the rooms have views of the island and the bay, with Vesuvius looming in the distance and Naples only 45 minutes away by ferry.Bernie GSeafood and sunsets in the Vendée, FranceView image in fullscreenThe beach at Les Sables d’Olonne in the Vendée.Photograph: Julien Leiv/Getty ImagesWe had a wonderful week in Les Sables d’Olonne in the Vendée. The town has plenty of sights – theshell museumwas well worth a trip – and there are many seafood restaurants. The main beach (La Grande Plage) is extremely popular and has beignet and glace-sellers and beach volleyball. However, we found ourselves gravitating to the less busy Plage de la Paracou, smaller and more rugged, no tourist trappings and wonderful sunsets. There was also a fantastic small open-air bar just over the dune, which had great live acoustic music a few nights a week.DollyPebble coves and olive groves on Silba, CroatiaView image in fullscreenA quiet bay on Silba.Photograph: Jure Gasparic/AlamyI didn’t know much about Silba before I arrived (on a catamaran from Zadar) – it’s a small, car-free island with no hotels, just family-run guesthouses. You can walk on shaded paths through olive groves, find quiet pebble coves with clear water for swimming and climb the Toreta tower at sunset for great views of the Adriatic. My tip: bring a snorkel, stay at least two nights and be sure to book your return ferry in advance, as schedules are limited.ElaineRAIL JOURNEYS TO REMEMBERThe night train from Belgrade to Lake SkadarView image in fullscreenRailway passing Lake Skadar.Photograph: Simon Dux/AlamyWe took a sleeper from Belgrade (after a few days exploring this cool, arty city) and loved the old-school velvety cabins with corridors and big open windows. We woke up to stunning Lake Skadar on the Montenegro-Albania border. After a few days exploring the lake, the ruined hill town of Stari Bar and Montenegro’s beautiful coastline, we headed back up to Belgrade by day – the mountainous scenery on this 11-hour journey is spectacular, and all for €50 round trip. We used theMan at Seat 61to learn about the route.JennyInterrail to MoroccoWe travelled from the UK to Morocco via train and ferry, stopping in Girona and Córdoba, both of which have picturesque old towns. In Córdoba we visited eight stunning courtyard gardens as well as thePalace of Vianaand theMezquita, surely one of the most astonishing buildings in the world. On the return leg we stopped in Málaga and Montpellier, both characterful places. We would have missed out on these wonderful destinations if we had flown directly to Marrakech.LouiseAnywhere in Belgium for €8.50View image in fullscreenAntwerp station.Photograph: StockByM/Getty ImagesLast year, my wife and I explored Belgium by train, staying in an apartment near Antwerp station, a fantastic cathedral to the railways containing several pink granite columns and panels, polished in our home town of Aberdeen. In Belgiumover-65s can buy a day return ticketto anywhere in the country for just €8.50. We visited several towns and cities, and discovered the Unesco-listedFlemish Béguinages– medieval communities composed of houses, churches and green spaces for widows or unmarried women, many now beautifully restored.Jim FiddesGlorious north Wales rail circuitView image in fullscreenAn aerial view towards the railway bridge at Barmouth.Photograph: Nicola Pulham/AlamyStarting in Shrewsbury, a spectacular multi-day circuit of north Wales is possible: take theCambrian Coast linethrough Aberystwyth, Barmouth and Porthmadog, then the gorgeousFfestiniog Railwayto Blaenau, where you can link back to Llandudno on the coast, and return to Shrewsbury (change at Llandudno Junction). There is no shortage of accommodation, allowing you to stop and explore without rigid planning. Out of summer the Cambrian coast and the seaside towns are unexplored jewels.Dave ThomasLaid-back vibes on the line to LjubljanaView image in fullscreenLjubljana.Photograph: Jan Wlodarczyk/AlamyAfter days getting blissfully lost in the quiet alleys and forgotten courtyards of Venice, we boarded the train from Santa Lucia station and sped across the shimmering lagoon to Trieste. In a sunlit square, we savoured chocolate gelato, the Mediterranean sparkling nearby. Next was laid-back Ljubljana, where we sipped cocktails by the river, surrounded by art and colour. Finally, a graffiti-covered train carried us toLake Bled, where we hiked and swam beneath the majestic Julian Alps, ending our journey in a cosy glamping pod under the stars and amid fireflies.AlexA perfect triangle inFranceView image in fullscreenThe Gare du Nord, Paris.Photograph: Sylvain Sonnet/Getty ImagesMy wife and I have travelled around a lot of Europe but our best trip for simplicity is a triangle of France: the Eurostar to Paris, then theTGV to Toulousefor saucisse and architectural and historical delights; next, theslow train to Bayonne, gazing at the Pyrenees as the train trundles past Lourdes, and on to the French Basque coast; then theTGV back up to Paris. City, gastronomy, mountains and beach all in one.GeorgeRome to Sicilyby train and ferryHop on the sleeper in Rome, or perhaps Naples, and wake the next morning in Sicily. There’s no bridge (yet) so the train is loaded on to a ferry for the crossing while you are sound asleep in one of the functional little compartments. You can go direct all the way to Palermo or beautiful Syracuse in the south-east of the island.PollyOFF THE BEATEN TRACK ADVENTURESCabin life on a Finnish lakeView image in fullscreenLake Saimaa in eastern Finland.Photograph: Mikko Turunen/Getty ImagesOne of the most magical places I’ve been is Lake Saimaa in eastern Finland – a labyrinth of islands and forests where you don’t come across many people. We rented a lakeside cabin and watched the midnight sun shimmer across peaceful waters. Days were spent kayaking between islets or hiking pine-scented trails, with only the call of black-throated divers (or loons) for company. We visited theLinnansaari national parkin the middle of the vast lake, where encounters with rare Saimaa ringed seals await. It’s nature’s embrace at its purest – remote, quiet and utterly rejuvenating.AnthonyRiverside camping in Portugal’s mountainsView image in fullscreenFun on the River Alva.Photograph: Constantino Sousa/AlamyThe sleepy villages of the Serra da Estrela, continental Portugal’s highest mountain range, are a world away from its coastal honeypots. In Vila Cova à Coelheira there is a free campsite on the banks of the River Alva, reached via an old Roman bridge that you can swim under (or jump in from, if you’re feeling brave). Even better, there is a bar at the river beach that serves excellentpica-pau– pork braised in wine with onions and pickles.DavidTrue remoteness in Scotland’s Outer HebridesView image in fullscreenGatliff Hebridean hostel.Photograph: Annett Doering/AlamyFor an experience of true remoteness, I’d recommend the Hebridean island of Berneray, between North Uist and Harris. Here you can walk across the rare grassland called the machair to the white, three-mile longWest beachand marvel at the immense space and colour of the Atlantic. We stayed atGatliff Hebridean hostel, which consists of two converted crofts where, for about £20 a night for a bunk, you will be staying in one of the most peaceful locations in the world.Nik FerneeQuiet beauty in MontenegroView image in fullscreenBlack Lake in the Durmitor national park.Photograph: Christian Sturzenegger/Getty ImagesIn autumn I visitedDurmitor national parkin northern Montenegro, a quiet and beautiful place in the Dinaric Alps. The road there passed through thick pine forests and opened on to wide valleys surrounded by tall, rocky mountains. I walked to the Black Lake (Crno Jezero), where the water was so still it perfectly reflected the autumn colours of the trees. In the hills, shepherds looked after their sheep, and small villages sold fresh cheese and honey. I also gazed down into Tara River canyon, one of Europe’s deepest gorges, and right at the bottom, several thousand feet below me, I could see the bright turquoise ribbon of the river.Lorna WalkdenA Unesco biosphere reserve near BarcelonaView image in fullscreenView from the top of Matagalls peak in the Montseny massif.Photograph: Cristian Zaharia/AlamyJust 40 miles from Barcelona lies aUnesco biosphere reserve, its peaks more than a thousand feet higher than Ben Nevis. The Montseny massif’s thick Mediterranean oak forests rise on all sides as you follow the single road threading its way up the horseshoe-shaped valley. About halfway up is the village of Montseny itself. Stop for a hike on any of the trails, followed by an ice-cream at Can Manel, a small bar with a big terrace and enormous views.LeoCroatia’s Mljet island is not for the jet setView image in fullscreenSnorkelling in the clear waters off Mljet island.Photograph: Joao Inacio/Getty ImagesIt’s only a few miles off the coast of Dubrovnik and its cruise-ship crowds, but Mljet feels like another world. Pine forests dip into turquoise bays, an ancient monastery sits on a tiny islet in the middle of a lake, and there’s hardly a sound beyond cicadas and the wind. I stayed in a simple family-run cottage just outside the national park, where evenings meant grilled fish on the terrace and nights under skies thick with stars. Days were spent kayaking across mirror-still water and walking through pine-scented trails where I rarely met another soul. It felt like stepping into a corner of Europe the 21st century has politely passed by.Mark AdamsonThe Romanian delta ‘on the edge of the world’View image in fullscreenA pelican colony in the Danube delta.Photograph: DPVUE/Getty Images/iStockphotoTheDanube deltamarks the eastern frontier of the EU and feels like the edge of the world. Accessible by boat from the port of Tulcea, it is one of Europe’s largest and most vital wetland ecosystems and is full of wildlife. We stayed at theDelta Boutique & Carmen Silva Resortin Crișan, an old working fishing village where tranquil evenings are broken only by the lively chorus of frogs. Guided boat safaris can be arranged via the hotel.JoshFAMILY HOLIDAYSAll aboard in the NetherlandsView image in fullscreenAmsterdam.Photograph: Alexander Spatari/Getty ImagesOur favourite family holiday was to the Netherlands: taking turns playing captain and guiding electric hire boats on canals; tilting our ice-cream cones at windmills at Zaanse Schans; cycling to the broad, clean beaches and cabanas; Amsterdam for the colourful Pride parade and counterpointed by a calming visit to De Poezenboot (which teen could resist a cat sanctuary on a canal boat?). And staying in Haarlem in an apartment with speedy wifi kept the teens happy while we indulged in morning strolls through medieval cobbled streets to Grote Markt for coffee and people-watching.AnnetteAn Italian castle at hostel pricesView image in fullscreenOstello il Castello di Santa Severa, north of Rome.Photograph: Maurizio Distefano/AlamyWhen I saw the picture ofOstello il Castello di Santa Severain the Guardian in 2019, I thought it was too good to be true, but it’s genuine. We have been twice with our teens, and sent friends too!A mile-long beach where teenagers can roam and paddleboard, an easy train journey to explore Rome, lunchtime pizza slices with locals cheering on the footie at L’Angolo delle Crepes. Plus the opportunity to sleep in a castle at hostel prices. Fluffy white towels aplenty, and a gleaming kitchen if you want to cook.Don’t miss the nearby necropolis for an Indiana Jones-style adventure. Fireworks over the castle and a hilarious Italian Beatles cover band were theciliegina sulla torta!MargaretMaking a splash in Austria’s lake districtView image in fullscreenWolfgangsee in the Austrian lake district.Photograph: Volkerpreusser/AlamySalzkammergut is the Austrian lake district. Lush meadows, forests and blue-green lakes make for endless days of swimming, biking and lying in the sun. Wolfgangsee has well-marked bike trails and opportunities to swim, alongside cafes serving deliciousKaiserschmarrn(fluffy pancakes) and schnitzel. Nearby Fuschlsee has an incredible water park right by the lake: swimming pools, slides and plenty of quiet water in which to swim. We stayed in the newly renovated Feichtingerbauer, which offers complimentary access to theFuschlseebad.NehaSlovenia’s raft of adventure activitiesView image in fullscreenVintgar gorge.Photograph: Unaihuizi/Getty ImagesWe started in Lake Bled. Our teens loved the Dolinka ziplines, the summer toboggan run, hiking in Vintgar gorge and swimming in the lake. You can hire paddleboards and boats. If you have the money, there is rafting and canyoning too. After seeing the incredible Postojna cave, we went up the Vogel cable by Lake Bohinj. Half-board at theBohinj Eco hotelkept us all amply fed and it also has an aquapark, bowling and plenty of games to boot. We finished the trip off with shopping in Ljubljana and the best ice-cream ever at Romantika.SueFamily-friendly camping in Pays de Loire, FranceI am a solo parent, andLe Domaine du Claryson the west coast of France has been our annual retreat since my daughter was three. The static caravans with decking offer a comfortable blend of camping and convenience. The parks, water slides and vibrant kids’ club activities provide endless fun for my daughter while I savour a few precious hours of calm or hire a bike to explore nearby towns such as Saint Jean de Monts. With friendly fellow travellers, it’s the perfect safe escape for a female adventurer.PaulaLaurie Lee inspired us to walk the Cotswold WayView image in fullscreenBroadway Tower on the Cotswold Way.Photograph: Lynne Nieman/AlamyAfter a family reading of Laurie Lee’sAs I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning, my husband and I decided our two teens were ready for a walking holiday in the Cotswolds. We set out on theCotswold Waywith backpacks and a tent, starting just outside lively Chipping Campden and ending in Bath. Mobiles were limited to an hour in the evening and we did 10 miles a day – covering the walk in 10 days. We felt part of a community of walkers as fellow hikers greeted us and shared drinks and tips along the way. We returned fitter, more together and happier than when we set out.AnnOompah bands and cable cars in BavariaView image in fullscreenHofbräuhaus am Platzl, Munich’s most famous beer hall.Photograph: Ross Helen/AlamyA two-centre holiday to Munich and Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria is a must with teenagers as there is so much to see and do. In Munich they loved the atmosphere in the beer halls – eating pretzels and listening to the oompah band and watching the Rathaus-Glockenspiel in the square. A visit to the Olympiapark is also recommended. In Garmisch-Partenkirchen there is a toboggan run, which is great fun, and nearby is the beautiful Zugspitze mountain and cable car, with boating on Eibsee lake.Richard WatkinsUNDER THE RADAR CITY BREAKSOlomouc, Czech RepublicView image in fullscreenOlomouc skyline.Photograph: Angelafoto/Getty Images/iStockphotoOlomouc is an utter delight. Gleaming spires and domes, two old town squares, enchanting cobbled lanes, trams and its own astronomical clock. It also has a Unesco-recognised holy trinity column, which was built to mark the end of a plague in the early 18th century. It’s a two-hour train ride from Prague but markedly less touristy. Two great places to enjoy a beer wereSaint Venceslav’s brewery, where there is a beer spa with a sauna scented with hops, andTwinburg, next to the Moravian cycle path, which serves delicious craft ales. I felt that this city had been put on Earth specially for me.Jack AndertonCity under the volcano, SicilyView image in fullscreenAlfresco Catania.Photograph: Robert Harding/AlamyA city brimming with life, Catania is a foodie haven and a great base to explore the island from. Home toarancini(deep fried rice balls) andcannoli (fried dough tubes filled with ricotta cheese), the city has incredible food experiences like the gelato fromDon Peppinuand sweet treats fromPasticceria Savia. It is also within striking distance of Mount Etna, as well as beautiful coastal destinations such as Taormina and Syracuse.GeorgePolar nights in Tromsø, Norway’s ‘Arctic capital’View image in fullscreenTromsø harbour and the Sandnessundet bridge.Photograph: Julia Lavrinenko/Getty ImagesAs a Scot who once sought drawn-out summer nights, I now lean into the opposite with fervour. Winter in Tromsø – the “Arctic capital” – is for travellers who embrace long, dark nights and are keen to meddle with their circadian rhythms. The polar night, when the sun doesn’t rise above the horizon, starts at the end of November and finishes in mid-January. Experience this unworldly extended twilight – the blue hour – from about 9am to 2pm. TheFjellheisencable car and silent whale-watching withBrim Explorerare two recommended activities.Aimee LawrenceWrocław, Poland’s buzzy student cityView image in fullscreenBeach bars in Wrocław.Photograph: Ingolf Pompe 19/AlamyWrocław has the perfect mix of quirkiness and beauty to make for a cracking, affordable city break. The hefty student population gives the city a real buzz, from the boat and beach bars along the River Oder (tryForma Płynnabeach bar), to the delicious Georgian bakeries (stop atPiekarnia Gruzińska PURIfor pastries on the way to checking out the painted backyards of the Nadodrze neighbourhood). While tourists concentrate around the huge central square, exploring the edge of the old town reaps rewards, likePub Drukarnia(delicious Litovel Czech beer) or Stacja Breslau bistro under the rail arches on Wojciecha Bogusławskiego street.Matt LuntExplore Jaén’s castles and cathedralView image in fullscreenJaén Cathedral.Photograph: Margouillat Photos/Getty ImagesThe city and the province of Jaén in Andalucía, Spain, can be overlooked by those heading to nearby Granada or Córdoba. That’s a shame, given that they are filled with Renaissance architecture, including a magnificent cathedral, and are renowned as a home of olive oil. Historically it held immense strategic importance due to its position between Christian Castilla and Muslim Granada, and it is surrounded by castles. I recommend staying at the Parador de Jaén, which sits at the top of the hill of Santa Catalina next to the castle. The views from its rooms towards the Sierra Morena mountains are unparalleled.FelixLeiden, a mini-Amsterdam with a buzzView image in fullscreenCanal in Leiden.Photograph: Xantana/Getty Images/iStockphotoLeiden – between the Hook of Holland and Amsterdam – is a fantastic destination easily reached by ferry from the UK. It offers everything Amsterdam does but on a smaller scale and has great places to stay, eat and enjoy. The mainly pedestrianised and historic town centre is beautiful, with a fantastic Saturday market along the canals. The large student population helps keep the city lively all year round.Ruud Jansen VenneboerWONDERS WORTH TRAVELLING FORGhosts of Knidos in south-west TurkeyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kenansavas/Getty ImagesWe’ve only ever reached the ancient Greek city of Knidos by sea, dropping anchor by the silted harbour that once sheltered a fleet of triremes (ancient war galleys). At night, when the few tourists who come here have gone, the toga-wrapped ghosts return. From our boat, we could feel them, roaming the mile upon mile of steep, ruined streets and collapsed temples; rising up out of the sea 30 miles west of modern Datça, to haunt the vast, crumbling metropolis which grew rich on sea trade before earthquakes and war returned it to dust and the crickets. Magnificent.Kay JonesGaelic island gem in County Kerry, IrelandView image in fullscreenThe monastic settlement at Skellig Michael.Photograph: Francesco Riccardo Iacomino/Getty ImagesThe sixth-century monastery and its tiny garden on top of Skellig Michael is an extraordinary place. The wind can howl up the sides of this mountain island, but climb the rocky stairs to the collection of ancient stone domed huts in the small depression on top and it is out of this world.ChrisWell worth its salt, KrakówView image in fullscreenWieliczka salt mine.Photograph: Gatsi/Getty Images/iStockphotoTheWieliczka salt minejust outsideKrakówis an architectural masterpiece and a Unesco world heritage site steeped in the history of the feudal salt trade. The shafts reach to more than 320 metres underground (the tourist route takes you to about 135 metres). Here you will find a cathedral etched into the salt and stone. With underground lakes, narrow corridors and guides who aren’t afraid to let you know how deep beneath the Earth’s surface you are, this amazing place isn’t for the fainthearted.JoeImages from prehistory in MoroccoAlong a bumpy road, behind the little village of Aït Ouazik, near Tazzarine, more than 300 prehistoric petroglyphs of elephants, rhino, giraffe, ostrich and more are carved into rocks atop a cliff-ringed hilltop. The exquisite depictions are impressive enough, and although the intent of the artists must be left to your imagination, you will leave with a sense of connection to the past and a people who gathered here 5,000 years ago, exchanging stories and recording the wonders they had encountered.George JoyPontcysyllte Aqueduct, ‘the river that runs in the sky’View image in fullscreenPontcysyllte Aqueduct and the River Dee.Photograph: Alasdair James/Getty ImagesThomas Telford’sPontcysyllte Aqueductis the centrepiece of a world heritage site that crosses three counties and two countries. There is a magic to standing halfway across “the river that runs in the sky”, looking down on the tumbling River Dee and Horseshoe Falls reservoir, the water Telford drew for his impossible canal project. Rather than a chain of locks cut across the valley, his iron trough spans it, joints sealed with red Welsh flannel dipped in boiling sugar. Opened in 1805, it is the highest, longest aqueduct in Britain.Fiona CollinsPitch amid the pines of Parnassus, GreeceView image in fullscreenSunset over Delphi.Photograph: Tomas Marek/AlamyArrive atDelphi Campingat night and pitch your tent under a sky the colour of dark wine among the pines of Mount Parnassus, haunt of the gods. The Kanatas family serve pine-scented retsina wine and slabs of creamy goat’s cheese, generously doused in oil harvested from their ancient olive groves. Awake at dawn and wander a dusty mountainside path to the archaeological sites, catching a glimpse of the temples through the trees. Return for an early dip in the campsite pool, perched above the Gulf of Corinth, 300 metres below.EmmaUzbekistan’s magical minaretView image in fullscreenThe Kalyan Minaret and mosque courtyard.Photograph: VW Pics/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesStanding proud in the heart of thesilk roadscity of Bukhara, the Kalyan Minaret exudes power and mystery in equal measure. Its beauty lies in the ornate brickwork arches and intricate geometric patterns that adorn its gently tapering body. So striking was this minaret that it was the only structure left unmolested by the Mongol warlord Genghis Khan, who reportedly could not bear to see it destroyed with the rest of the city. At night it is lit up and acts as a beacon, drawing locals and travellers alike to bask in its presence.Carl Sucharyna ThomasACTIVE BREAKSLocal flavour on a trek in the Italian AlpsView image in fullscreenThe Guglielmo Migliorero Refugem, a key stopover on the Grande Traversata delle Alpi.Photograph: Fabrizio Robba/AlamyWe completed three weeks of theGrande Traversata delle Alpi, a 500-mile trek in the Italian Alps. It was conceived as an economic regeneration project in the 1970s to join up and provide tourism to tiny villages with ageing populations and declining industry. In each location, one or more providers elects to supply accommodation and food to hikers; as a result the variety in our stays was immense. It cost €60-70pp pn half-board, sometimes less in dormitories. It’s a very quiet trail compared with many in the Alps, and we often had it to ourselves. Villagers are friendly and we enjoyed delicious local food, always at least three courses, with vegetarians fully catered for.Samantha McGradySailing on the Norfolk BroadsView image in fullscreenSailing boat from Hunter’s Yard.Photograph: Anglia Images/AlamyHunter’s Yardin Ludham looks after a fleet of 1930s cabin yachts and day boats, some now with electric motors. Beautifully maintained and easy to sail, they provide a restful, beautiful holiday. Away from the popular spots, the Norfolk Broads remain wild and full of birds and animals. Go to your bunk early, with the sound of water, ducks and rigging. Get up early and sail past the sleeping gin palaces. Moor up early near a pub for your evening drinks. Hunter’s Yard staff are friendly and happy to advise; I’ll never forget the smell of wood and varnish in their workshops.RupertScaling the heights in a hidden Asturias valleyView image in fullscreenPeña Ubiña in the Cantabrian Mountains.Photograph: Westend61/AlamyTheMeicín hostelin Asturias, on the border with the ancient kingdom of León, is surrounded by jagged mountains, wild ponies and, if you’re lucky, bears. Climb Picos del Fontán (2,414 metres) and you’ll be unlikely to encounter any other hikers as you walk through a hidden valley and year-round snowfields. Peña Ubiña, after which the national park is named, has views south to the Castilian plains, and north to the far busier Picos de Europa. The hostel offers full board in dorms, and you can hike or taxi to it from the high-speed station, Pola de Lena, which connects with Gijón on the Asturian coast.Robert GrahamHorse riding in the Welsh bordersView image in fullscreenHorse riding in Clyro, Powys.Photograph: PRWe return toFreerein Riding Holidaysin Clyro (Cleirwy), Powys, every year. It’s a fantastic way to view the Welsh countryside; you can self-guide with the maps and instructions provided or go with an experienced guide. Everything is included, including your meals and stays in beautiful country inns or guesthouses.Vanessa JonesAn idyllic campsite in ProvenceView image in fullscreenThe Gorges du Verdon, a limestone river canyon famous for its striking turquoise-green colour.Photograph: Bernd Rehorst/AlamyCamping du Montdenieris an idyllic, isolated spot in the mountains just above the Gorges du Verdon. You can spend days relaxing in the surrounding hills and lavender fields, or take advantage of the mountain biking, horse riding and paragliding on offer near the site. When you fancy a bit more life, take a trip down to one of the restaurants in Moustiers-Sainte-Marie, a beautiful village that sits beneath limestone cliffs and is famous for its pottery. For the more adventurous, Verdon is the birthplace of sport climbing, or you can stay closer to the ground on a day trip canoeing down the gorge.LucyHiking and hospitality in AlbaniaView image in fullscreenA ferry on Lake Koman.Photograph: Hugh Mitton/AlamyMy partner and I had a magical time in the northern Albanian mountains. From Shkodër, we made our way to theValbona valley national parkvia a two-night stay on (and boat across) Lake Koman. Once in Valbona, we embarked on a series of spectacular hikes, including a three-day circular toÇerem. The first two days we saw no one apart from shepherds – and a few vipers. The views were breathtaking, the hospitality welcoming, and the experience incomparable.AlexRunning wild in Argyll and ButeView image in fullscreenBeach running in Argyll.We had an unforgettable experience at regenerativeAuchgoyle Farmon Scotland’s west coast. The running trails were adventurous and exciting, leading us through ancient woodland, across beaches and over hills.The wildlife and landscape were further brought to life by hosts Katharine and David’s infectious passion for – and knowledge of – their local environment. Between runs, we were rejuvenated with delicious home-cooked meals in the stunning farmhouse, and activities including yoga, wild swimming, a wood-fired sauna, art class and coffee tasting. We left feeling inspired, recharged and nourished by nature.KateTwinkling lights in Poland’s Tatra mountainsView image in fullscreenThe Snowlandia ice labyrinth in Zakopane, PolandZakopaneis a great base for skiers and anyone who enjoys winter mountain activities. It’s affordable (my chalet was just €400 for the week) and has lovely traditional wooden and stone houses, cafes and cheap restaurants serving tasty Polish stews andpierogis(filled dumplings), which kept us warm throughout. We hired snow shoes to explore the foothills by day, and at dusk the twinkling lights of the mountain villages came on, adding to the wonderful scene of lakes, mountains and forests. We also enjoyed sleigh rides and husky-driven carriages through the silent forests to magicalSnowlandia ice maze(open mid-January to mid-March).YasminGuardian Travel runs aweekly readers’ tips competition.

But don’t expect a luxurious journey – or a quick oneDoosie MorrisSat 10 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 10 Jan 2026 19.53 ESTShareRail voyages such as the Ghan, the India Pacific and Great Southern might capture the imagination with their multi-day, cross-continental passages but their golden tickets come with prices to match. For rail-lovers seeking a more humble way to hit the tracks, along the east coast at least, robust state networks offer a spectrum of long-distance options. From rail beds with in-seat on-demand entertainment to past-their-prime rattlers, Australia’s intercity trains are not for the faint of heart or time poor but their steel tentacles spread far and wide, unlocking regional gems and distance travel for those who crave that old-fashioned feeling.Melbourne-Sydney-BrisbaneView image in fullscreenThe XPT at Sydney’s Central station.Photograph: picturelibrary/AlamyAustralia’s best attempt at commuter-centric cross-border travel is the middle-aged workhorse the XPT, which connects Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane via 38 stations in between. For 43 years the intercity beasts have rattled up and down the south-east ferrying the brave, the bored and the broke.While refurbishments of the trains’ interiors and air conditioning have given the journey a lift, the consensus is that, while functional, relatively comfy and affordable, the whole experience continues to leave a lot to be desired.A-to-B journeys fromMelbourne to Sydney or Sydney to Brisbane(or vice versa) come in at about $100 – about the same price as a low-range air fare for adults. The Sydney-to-Melbourne route runs twice daily each way; between Sydney and Brisbane there’s one direct service each way(note that New South Wales daylight savings affects Brisbane departure and arrival times).A perhaps little-known quirk of the journey is because it’s operated by NSW TrainLink up tofour children can ride for just $1 eachwith an adult from their household (don’t forget to tick the box at the bottom of the booking page); children under three travel free but they must have a reserved seat.The downside is if you’re planning on tackling the Melbourne-Brisbane route, the journey will take you the best part of two days. If you take an overnight from Melbourne you’ll arrive at Brisbane’s Roma Street about 4am after an eight-hour layover in Sydney.If you’re not schlepping it with the brood and want to make an adventure of it, theDiscovery Pass– the country’s only hop-on hop-off Eurail-style deal available to NSW residents and international visitors – can turn a harrowing intercity commute into a tri-state gallivant. Passes start at $232 for unlimited travel on the NSW TrainLink network for 14 days, with one-, three- and six-month passes also available. All services need to be booked in advance but, if you harbour some unrequited vagabond tendencies, this is your best-value Australian ticket to raildog freedom.Those aboard the XPT could be forgiven for thinking they have stepped back in time, and it’s not just the decor. Essentially a mobileFaraday cage, the trains have no way to charge phones or laptops, or to access wifi, even via cellular data; so bring a book and consider it a digital detox. Refreshments range from microwave meals to the long-haul train classic – scones and jam with a state beer. Don’t forget to bring some cash though, as Eftpos service isn’t reliable. There is no seating in the buffet car, so expect to enjoy your provisions at your own seat. While there, you probably won’t notice much difference between the first-class and economy options and that’s because they are all but identical – though in first class you’ll be treated to a few extra centimetres of leg room and an extra 12 degrees of recline, adding about $40 to the standard $99 fare from Melbourne to Sydney.All things going to plan,the XPT fleet will be replaced in coming years with new Spanish-built trains– the first of which began testing in February 2025. Originally slated to be on the tracks in 2023, design squabbles and cost blowouts have resulted in years-long delays. Sleeper options have been dispensed with – but the new trains will at least have wifi and in-seat charging ports.New South Wales/ACTNSW TrainLink’s Xplorer trains service the bulk of the state’s regional network. At over 30 years old, they too have seen better days and are also due to be replaced with the new Spanish trains when they arrive. For now, their rattling charm fans out from Sydney on five lines to Armidale, Moree, Griffith, Broken Hill and Canberra. There are daily services to Armidale, Moree and Canberra, and pricing for all five lines fluctuates with peak seasons. Booking well in advance often means cheaper fares.The $1 kids’ deal applies here, too, and pensioners can ride for just$2.50 a journeythroughout the region, but only for travelbooked a week or less in advance. Standard economy fares start from about $50, depending on the destination, and the journey can take from four hours to Canberra, to a13-hour slog to Broken Hill.VictoriaView image in fullscreenV/Line VLocity trains at Southern Cross railway station.Photograph: Benjamin Crone/AlamyVictoria is the only state in the country that has managed to execute the concept of regional travel as it should be: easy, affordable and elegant. Designed for reliable and regular services, the purpose-builtVLocity trainshit the tracks in 2005 and remain sleek, clean and comfortable enough to make it to the state’s edges without needing to book an osteo appointment when you disembark.With daily capped statewide fares that extend to 60km beyond theborder ($11.40 for an adult, $5.70 concession) a day trip on most of the 13 lines is usually only a matter of loading up your Myki, arriving at Southern Cross and choosing your own adventure. Some of the further-flung destinations – like Albury and Swan Hill – still use older model locohaul trains and require a paper ticket or e-ticket but are still covered by the cap.On some lines there is the option toreserve a seat, though passengers can otherwise travel in the unreserved carriages and try their luck with securing a seat.All regional trains have bathrooms and free drinking water but only the Swan Hill and Albury lines feature a buffet car.QueenslandView image in fullscreenThe overnight XPT from Sydney to Brisbane arrives at Roma Street railway station.Photograph: Richard Milnes/AlamyCovering certainly the greatest distances, theQueensland regional networkspans from tropical Cairns to the outback on five lines of varying luxury. The Spirit of Queensland, the state’s flagship distance train, departs from Brisbane four times a week for a 25-hour journey between the state capital and Cairns, and fares start from about $220. Economy seats aren’t lavish but, if you’re a veteran of international cattle-class flying, you’ll make it. The trains’ unique “rail beds”, on the other hand, convert a comfortable seat by day into a completely lie-down experience overnight, replete with in-seat entertainment, crisp linen and meals served on actual crockery included, all for an extra $150. The rail beds often sell out so it’s a good idea to book early.View image in fullscreenRail beds on the Spirit of Queensland.Photograph: Queensland RailHead 26 hours to Longreach from Brisbane from $140 for an economy seat, or for about $420 and you can indulge in a day sitter cum sleeper option. There are no TVs but meals are included and so is a shower. The 17- and 21-hour journeys to Charleville and Mount Isa don’t offer any sleeping options but the trains are fitted with lounge carts and the tea and coffee is free. The tilt train from Brisbane to Rockhampton via Bundaberg offers a business-class option and free – although patchy – wifi.The rest of the countryView image in fullscreenWestern Australia’s AvonLink train.Photograph: Public Transport Authority of WAWestern Australia’s regional rail servicehas four lines, three of which unfurl from Perth to Kalgoorlie, Bunbury and Merredin, while the fourth typically runs between Midland and Northam (due totrackwork, from 3 January to 21 February 2026 the service travels between East Perth and Northam, and does not stop at Midland). Fares have been permanently slashed by 50% starting this month – making tickets between $4.65 and $69 one way – and a ticket on any of these services also entitles you to same-day free travel on all other regional and city services.In South Australia all country services were discontinued in the 1990s but the trustyOverland, operated by Journey Beyond, will ferry you smoothly from Melbourne to Adelaide a couple of times a week via an 11-hour day service, with fares starting at $150 each way. Tasmania’s only intercity train succumbed in 1978 and, aside from the Ghan, the Northern Territory does not have its own distance rail network.Explore more on these topicsTravelAustralia holidaysRail transportAustralasia holidaysTourism (Australia)New South WalesAustralian Capital TerritoryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A second necessary tool in the month of January is the ability to dispose of or transform a swede into an evening meal. For the uninitiated, when roasted, the swede, that pretty, purple-creamed, dense little ball, is part-creamy, part carrot-like in nature, and earthy and sweet in flavour. It also takes to big-flavoured sauces such as this tomato, ginger and coconut curry like a chip to vinegar and couples up well with its seasonal pal, fresh, crunchy purple sprouting broccoli.Roast swede and purple sprouting broccoli curryI useMutti tomatoes, which are very finely chopped and which transform into a sauce much quicker than general chopped tomatoes. Other brands are available, of course, and may label their finely chopped tomatoes as rustic pomodoro.Prep15 minCook1 hr 10 minServes42 medium swedes(or 1 large swede; 1.2kg), peeled, halved and cut into wedges of 2cm at their widest pointRapeseed oil2 tsp fine sea salt1 large onion(or 2 medium ones), peeled and finely sliced6 garlic cloves, peeled and minced6cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and very finely chopped (45g)1½ tsp kashmiri chilli powder1 tsp ground turmeric400g tin finely chopped tomatoes, or rustic pomodoro2400ml tins coconut milk400g sprouting broccoli, florets kept whole, the rest cut into 2cm pieces20g bunch Thai basil, leaves pickedRice or flatbreads, to serveHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Toss the swede wedges with three tablespoons of oil and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, then spread out on an oven tray and roast for 35-45 minutes, turning once halfway, until soft, tender and golden at the edges. Remove, and leave the oven on.While the swede is roasting, put four tablespoons of oil in a wide, ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat and, when hot, add the onion and one and a quarter teaspoons of salt. Cook, stirring, until the onion is soft and turning golden brown, then stir in the garlic and ginger and cook for another two minutes. Add the kashmiri chilli and turmeric, then tip in the tinned tomatoes and coconut milk, cook for 10 minutes more, and take off the heat.Add the broccoli and roast swede to the curry sauce, stir to coat, then pop the pan in the oven for 15 minutes, until the broccoli is tender and everything is well coated in the sauce.Finely slice the Thai basil leaves, fold half of them into the curry, then scatter the rest over the top. Serve warm with rice or flatbreads.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodCurryWinter food and drinkHerbs and spicesTomatoesMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“The amazing and rather magical thing about marmalade,” Pam says, “is that if 100 people made a panful, each one would vary: different sugars, different peel sizes, different boil times and even different water influence the final outcome.” Store-bought products are no different, though most commercially produced marmalades are made with extra pectin, acidity regulators and orange oil, which, while relatively harmless, all affect the taste and texture, and aren’t entirely necessary, either.The best supermarket marmaladeBest overall:Tiptree ‘tawny’ orange marmaladeView image in fullscreen£2.95 for 340g at Waitrose (87p/100g)★★★★☆A classic dark marmalade with a rich, caramel, orange flavour.
