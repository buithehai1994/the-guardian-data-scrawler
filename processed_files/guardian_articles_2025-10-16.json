His tour of crypto-CEOs exposes the bleakness of their world – but it sure makes for comedy goldRachel AroestiThu 16 Oct 2025 18.05 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 19.04 EDTShareNear the start of this hilarious and ambiently horrifying documentary, presenter Oobah Butler informs the viewer what exactly is riding on the success of his latest stunt. Emerging from a meeting at Channel 4’s headquarters, he floats a contract in front of the camera. In signing this, Butler claims, he is “guaranteeing that I am going to make a million pounds in 90 days”. If he succeeds, he’ll be a rich man. If he fails, “I suppose I won’t be working withChannel 4again.”If Butler is yet to make it on to your radar, those stakes may sound negligible – does it really matter whether this man ever makes another TV programme? To that I say: yes, it absolutely does. Over the past decade, Butler has established himself as one of the most enjoyably idiosyncratic prankster-satirists of the modern age. He gained global attention with a 2017 project for Vice magazine, in which he managed to get a completely fictional establishment – “The Shed at Dulwich” – listed as London’s top restaurant on TripAdvisor, questioning the effectiveness of the algorithm (when TripAdvisor became aware that it was a fake, they took it down).In his first Channel 4 documentary, 2023’sThe Great Amazon Heist, he applied his irreverent tactics to a bigger (the biggest?) target, revealing lax age restrictions (by getting children to order knives via Alexa) and poor working conditions (which Amazon denied). With deadpan humour and a relentlessly left-field point of view, Butler specialises in highlighting the void – of value, of morality – at the heart of the forces that shape our world.Yet in How I Made a Million in 90 Days, Butler takes a different tack. Rather than scamming the scammers, he decides to join them in their grift. Noting how fixated gen Z are on becoming entrepreneurs and startup founders, he attempts to use the get-rich-quick schemes of social media business gurus to drastically inflate his net worth.Initially, Butler’s exploits are just wildly funny. First, he binges on the advice of the movement’s gods – your Steven Bartletts, your Luke Belmars. Then he starts a business. With no time for growth, he decides to produce outrageous limited-edition products that will generate hype and give his company value. To achieve this, Butler enters troll mode, establishing the “first legal child sweatshop in Britain in over a century”. Using a legal loophole, he (sort of) gets kids to manufacture a new line of football shirts. But these aren’t any old football shirts: in a pastiche of the “amoral shite” on Premier League strips, these are fabric paeans to cigarettes, shaped by a cackle-inducing brainstorming session with a group of sparky primary schoolchildren.‘Please can I have a million pounds?’ A documentary-maker’s wild attempt to strike it rich in 90 daysRead moreIt’s great value comedically, but Butler quickly realises he doesn’t have enough cash to fund the project, so goes to New York in search of an investor. This is where things take a bleaker turn. Mingling with various unsettling finance guys, Butler finds an ally in Iqram Magdon-Ismail, co-founder of mobile payment app Venmo. Magdon-Ismail, who is unusually energetic and likes to write business proposals on tinfoil, seems willing to invest, until Butler describes the other products he’s thinking of selling, such as luggage that looks like a bomb. Then he ghosts him, forcing Butler into the (empty, as it turns out) pockets of an investor called Tom, who is apparently happy to be filmed requesting “a full body shot” from a woman on a video call.Butler becomes despondent. Not just because he’s failing at his task – he does publicity stunts for a crypto company who promise funding only to deliver less than hoped; he regrets not getting involved in Magdon-Ismail’s booming meme coin (the fact his parents once lost money in a pyramid scheme had put him off) – but because compromising his integrity in the pursuit of big money is utterly soul-destroying. Eventually, Iqram resurfaces with a great idea. Why doesn’t Butler auction off 10% of all his future earnings for a million quid? (I can think of a few reasons.)With a premise this audacious, you may not be astonished to hear that the ending is ever so slightly fudged – although I’m not saying he doesn’t pull it off. It doesn’t matter. Along the way, Butler has managed to strip the aspiration from extreme wealth, demonstrate the false promises of hustle culture, show how much of the crypto-CEO world is built on sand and hot air and prove once again his appealing combination of wry bravado and scrappy relatability. At a time when cookie-cutter celebrity-fronted documentaries dominate, it’s especially gratifying to see something beamed straight from the brain of an inimitably ingenious host. Butler’s future may not be paved with gold, but it should be littered with Channel 4 contracts.How I Made a Million in 90 Days is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionChannel 4CryptocurrenciesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Thanks to GPS tracking, scientists are uncovering extraordinary insights into ancient and mysterious journeys – and new threats that are reshaping them.As storm-chasing seabirds, Desertas petrels seek out hurricanes that draw deep-sea creatures to the surface. Only about 200 pairs remain, although the population is stable.Each bird is no bigger than a pigeon and they all breed on a single deserted island off the west coast of north Africa, fanning out across the Atlantic Ocean to forage.Among the 35 birds that have been tracked by GPS is“Marlo”, which was born on Bugio Island and tagged after returning there in 2019. Males and females are virtually indistinguishable, so researchers do not know the sex of Marlo but we will refer to him as “he”.Map of Marlo’s migration path in 2019, showing a zigzag route across the central Atlantic between Europe, north Africa and North America and then down to the coast off northern South AmericaVideo of a desertas petrel with a wide wingspan flying just above the wavesMarlo is part of a pair bonded for life, and he and his partner reunite with a flurry of excitement after months apart, preening and calling to each other. The parents raise one chick as a tag team, doing long shifts at sea for up to three weeks at a time, covering distances of up to 7,400 miles (12,000km). They gorge on seafood and regurgitate it as oil for their chick.Francesco Ventura, from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, says: “The routes they take are some of the longest collected for any animal during breeding season. It’s like travelling to the other side of the Atlantic for a food shop.”Once his chick successfully fledged, Marlo departed Bugio on 2 November 2019, and did not touch land until June of the following year. Like all Desertas petrels, Marlo spends the majority of his life soaring above international waters.Typically, the young spend the first few years of their life out at sea without touching land. No one knows where they go. If they survive these early years, they typically live for decades.View image in fullscreenMarlo’s Desertas petrel chick in September 2019.Photograph: Monica SilvaIn September 2019, Marlo flew out over the Atlantic Ocean and came across the cyclone that was developing into Tropical Storm Gabrielle. Researchers tracing their migrations have discovered that petrels actively steer into storms, perhaps reading changes in air pressure, cloud patterns and the swell of waves to find them.“To me, this looks like intentionality,” says Ventura, who was part of thefirst team of researchers to track this behaviourin Desertas petrels.A meteorological map showing wind direction with a line going due west from just off west Africa until it reaches the mid-point of the Atlantic and then heads north-eastThe route taken across the ocean by the Desertas petrel as it tracked the course of a stormFor 19 days, Marlo chased the tropical storm’s wake, covering nearly 7,000 miles and reaching speeds of 41mph (66km/h). Hurricanes churn up cold, nutrient-rich water, which draws deep-sea squid and crustaceans to the surface where birds can catch them.Climate change threatens the prey these seabirds depend on because the marine creatures are so sensitive to changing temperatures, sometimes shifting northwards and deeper as the ocean warms.Marlo covers as much ground as possible to maximise his chance of catching something, hunting at night and using smell to locate prey in the darkness. “They don’t flap,” says Ventura. “They surf the wind.”Weighing no more than a large strawberry, the nightingale manages to cross the Sahara twice a year as part of a 6,000-mile round-trip between its spring breeding grounds in England and overwintering ground in west Africa.But their journey is becoming increasingly fraught and their destination less welcoming.Map showing the approximate route of a nightingale from the UK to Africa, flying over Spain, going through the Strait of Gibraltar, following the cost of west Africa, and arriving in Senegal“Berkeley” is a one-year-old nightingale tagged near Alton Water, a nature reserve a few miles south of Ipswich in the UK. He was caught on the 31 May 2023 in a dense patch of bramble and blackthorn, and fitted with a GPS tag the weight of a paperclip.A male nightingale fitted with a geolocator.Photograph: Chas HoltDuring the summer Berkeley would have tirelessly gathered beetles, ants, flies and caterpillars to feed his young. Once his family had flown the nest, he was ready to migrate south.Berkeley waited for the perfect night in late August before leaving: mild, clear and still. He crossed the Channel and flew down the west coast of France to Spain where he spent three weeks recuperating and putting on fat before tackling the Atlantic Ocean and Sahara.Some nightingales may make this crossing in a couple of days straight; others will stop during the day, resting at a desert oasis if they pass one.Climate crisis-driven droughts and wildfires in southern Europe, however, mean more birds are dying over the Sahara as they are forced to continue their migration without getting into prime flying condition.Bad weather can also throw them off course, and they are hunted by the giant noctule bat over the mountains of the Iberian peninsula. Berkeley flew high over the desert at about 5,000 metres to stay cool, and managed to dodge all these threats.On 26 September, five weeks after leaving Alton Water, he arrived in Senegal. “Before leaving they should have a nice chunky body and rounded chest. By the end, it’s an emaciated thing,” says Chris Hewson, who tracks these birds for the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO).After a gruelling journey, the vast majority of nightingales winter in Senegal, the Gambia and Guinea-Bissau, but this area has become increasingly threatened since the 1960s due to severe droughts, less rainfall and a bigger human population, collecting firewood and grazing livestock. This has led to irreversible changes and reduced the quality of their habitat.Map showing how British nightingales confine themselves to a small area in Senegal and the Gambia, while the nightingales from France and Italy scatter over more suitable areas inland in the Ivory Coast and GhanaThe birds’ habitat in Britain has also been very degraded, with increased numbers of deer, reduced scrub and woodlands. The nightingale population documented in Britain has fallen by 91% over the past 50 years, and the loss of suitable habitat at both ends of their migration is driving that decline.Understanding exactly where the birds are by using more precise GPS tags will help ecologists do more focused conservation work in the areas of highest importance.Bewick’s swans are one of the heaviest long-distance migratory birds. Their migration of nearly 2,200 miles takes so much energy they have to refuel every few hundred miles.They were once dependent on aquatic plants but since the 1960s – when agriculture intensified across northwestern Europe – they have switched to feeding on grass and crops, and can eat throughout north-west Europe.“Mary” was caught and tagged on 20 December 2016 in North Brabant province in the Netherlands. She was at least four years old and caring for a cygnet.Map showing Mary’s journey from the Russian tundra to EuropeBy the following spring, she had embarked on a long journey north, arriving in the breeding grounds in the remote and wind-swept Malozemelskaya tundra, an area of the Arctic in northern Russia dominated by bogs and wetlands. In September, she set out from the tundra on her autumn migration south, flying to western Latvia, then to Lower Saxony in northern Germany for the winter.As Europe warms, Bewick’s swans are making much shorter journeys to ice-free wetlands and agricultural areas in the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Poland – known as short-stopping. Britain haslost an estimated 43% of its Bewick’s swansin five years.Video of swans flyingAbout 60 swans are carrying GPS collars on their necks. Tracking data shows that swans adjust their autumn journeys on a daily basis. On colder days, the birds travel bigger distances but if it is warm, they sometimes do not move at all.Hans Linssen, a doctoral student from the University of Amsterdam,has done modelling on the same birds over several yearsand showed thatif winter was 1C (1.8F) colder, the birds would spend it on average 75 miles farther south-west.Short-stopping means the birds can adapt their wintering season to a changing climate. Although it is a loss for people in the Netherlands and the UK – which used to be the winter capitals for Bewick’s swans – this ability to adapt to the seasons is likely to be an advantage for the birds.“If they spend their winter closer to the breeding range, the distance that they have to go for the next spring is also shorter, which also enables them to migrate faster,” says Linssen.Map comparing the wintering locations of Bewick’s swans in different years and the average temperature at those times. While in 2016 the swans went further into the Netherlands at 3.02 C, in 2019 at 5.53C, they lingered around Poland and LithuaniaThe Bewick’s swan population is rapidly declining, but this might have more to do with illegal hunting than climate change, says Linssen. Up to a third of Bewick’s swans in the UK have lead pellets from shotgun shells or fishing weights embedded in their bodies.Other potential pressures include competition with other species such as whooper and mute swans on spring migration stopovers, and predation of eggs and hatchlings in the Arctic as predators such as red foxes shift farther north.Illustrations by Tina Zellmer, graphics byHeidi WilsonandHarvey SymonsFind moreage of extinction coverage here, which is supported byGuardian.orgMethodologyGlobal temperature data came fromCHELSA’sdaily mean air temperatures measured from hourly ERA5 data, spanning from 1981 to 2010.

IfKeir Starmerthought that releasing the three witness statements of the deputy national security adviser (DNSA) Matthew Collins late on Wednesday night was going to make the China spy case row go away, then he was in for a big disappointment.There was no way MPs were going to let a story like this out of their clutches. This was their moment to take centre stage. When they could bathe in their own importance. When they could believe that they and national security were one and the same thing.There again, whatever Starmer had put into the public domain would never have been enough. Even a letter from the director of public prosecutions (DPP), Stephen Parkinson, falling on his sword and admitting he had taken his eye off the ball, would have been dismissed as irrelevant.When it comes to a choice between cock-up and conspiracy, most MPs naturally gravitate to conspiracy. So much more exciting. Life’s too dull when it’s just some unelected apparatchik doing a job badly.As the facts change, MPs merely change their conspiracy theories to fit the new evidence. In her embarrassing tirades at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, Kemi Badenoch had insisted that Starmer was at the centre of a major cover-up. That he had personally leant on Collins to get him to change his evidence. That he was basically a Chinese spy himself, doing the bidding of his masters in Beijing. Punching the air in triumph as the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) collapsed the trial.Come Thursday morning, that particular narrative appeared dead in the water. There was just no evidence to support it. But not to worry. Because another conspiracy theory was at hand. One that was the polar opposite of the previous one. In this exciting new version, it was Starmer’s lack of involvement, his failure to nobble Collins that was compelling proof the prime minister was a Chinese stooge.A true red, white and blue patriot would have done whatever it took to secure a conviction. Stopped at nothing. Putting a gun to Collins’s and Parkinson’s heads. Doing nothing was simply unforgivable. As one door closed for opposition MPs, another one opened. Not that there was any recognition that the terms of reference for the conspiracy theory had just done a U-turn. On days like these politicians imagine themselves to be a tabula rasa. Yesterday doesn’t matter. It never happened. All that matters is what happens today.So it was almost inevitable there would be an urgent question in the Commons to give MPs a platform to air their new theories that had been developed overnight. You can generally gauge how much trouble the government reckons it is in by the minister it sends out to answer a UQ. Get a cabinet minister and the government is supremely confident of its position. So the appearance of Chris Ward, the most junior of ministers in the Cabinet Office making his first ever outing at the dispatch box, on the government frontbench, told you all you needed to know.And, to be fair, Ward did about as well as could be expected under the circumstances. He didn’t die on his arse and only had to endure a modicum of faux pity from opposition MPs. It’s just that he would much rather have been anywhere than in the Commons at 10.30 on a Thursday morning.It wasn’t so much that he had nothing much to say – which he didn’t really – it was more that he knew nothing he did have to say was going to make much difference. Try telling a UFO convention that UFOs don’t exist will only make the audience even more convinced they do. Because the establishment would say that, wouldn’t they?Poor Chris. All he could do was stand up and read the words in front of him. The DNSA had made the witness statements without any interference from government. He wasn’t entirely sure why Collins had added a line from the Labour manifesto aboutChinabeing an economic opportunity. Presumably to give context that Labour’s line on China was not that much different to the Tories. And you’d have to ask the DPP why the CPS had dropped the case.Then the onslaught, First from shadow minister for policy renewal, Neil O’Brien. The CPS had said they were just 5% short on the evidence they needed to get take the case to trial. Why hadn’t the government done whatever it took to get the case over the line? To a layperson, this sounded very much like expecting the government to fabricate new evidence if the existing material was insufficient. But maybe spy trials don’t count. There again, surely the Met could have knocked something up. They are old hands at that sort of thing.Labour MPs were equally bewildered. Emily Thornberry couldn’t work out why the CPS had not just backed off and let a jury decide on the guilt. Matt Western, chair of joint committee of national security strategies, announced he would be starting an inquiry of his own. Barry Gardiner raised doubts about the quality of information the spies had provided. Careful Bazza. Careless talk cost lives. Just because the spies passed on information freely available elsewhere and gossip picked up in the coffee queue in Portcullis House, this didn’t mean it was any less serious. This was MPs we were talking about. Nothing is more important than that.Tory Tom Tugendhat, one of the two MPs targeted, begged the prime minister to come to his rescue. How could he have abandoned Tom by not leaning more heavily on Collins? This wasn’t party politics, it was a matter of life and death. Just provide the evidence, damn it! If you haven’t got it, then invent it. It wasn’t hard. What was the point of being prime minister if you didn’t bang up spies?The Tories kept on coming. Bernard Jenkin refused to believe Collins wasn’t nobbled in some way. Bernie couldn’t explain whether he had been nobbled to keep quiet or write rubbish witness statements. Jeremy Wright and Nick Timothy wanted the spies banged up regardless of whether they were guilty or not. Miraculously, none of the Conservatives engaged with the fact that it had been their own government’s stance on China that had collapsed the case. Or that the case would have still collapsed if they had been in power.Ward just stood there and took it all. It was all a big cock-up. Look to the CPS for answers. The government was equally gutted the case had not gone ahead. Come the end, there were points of order from Alicia Kearns, another spyee, Tugendhat and Graham Stuart. Stuart asked for an expression of sympathy to be shown towards Ward. Chris looked crushed. Ridicule he could take.

It was the night injury-time goals from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær sealedUnited’s 2-1 comebackin the Champions League final against Bayern Munich at the Camp Nou. It was also the night the life of one United fan in Bulgaria, who has died this week at the age of 62, changed for ever.That supporter was born Marin Zdravkov Levidzhov in Svishtov, a town on the Danube with a population of 22,000. Growing up in communist Bulgaria adoring football, he dreamed of changing his name to …Manchester United. To claim the name of a football club from the capitalist west, however, was mission impossible. Had Marin tried to do so before the fall of the regime, he would almost certainly have ended up in jail.Ten years after the end of communism in Bulgaria – on that night in May 1999 – Marin’s idiosyncratic dream edged closer to reality. Watching the final from his modest home in Svishtov and with United trailing, Marin made a promise to himself: if United somehow turned the game around, he would do anything to change his name to that of the club he loved. Then the impossible happened.View image in fullscreenMarin fulfils his dream of visiting Old Trafford.Photograph: Family handoutThe next day, Marin visited a lawyer expressing his unusual request and so began a long, hard battle. Marin’s father, from whom he had inherited his love of United, was long gone and the 36-year-old was living with his mother, working all kinds of odd jobs, including as a construction worker on £15 a day. He was hardly making ends meet, yet his dream became an obsession. He quickly turned into the talk of the town, then became an international sensation, but 15 years full of legal battles and disheartening court decisions lay ahead.Marin’s wish was rejected initially for copyright reasons: he could not change his name to a trademark known around the globe. Then a local judge ruled partially in his favour, saying Marin could change his first name to Manchester but that he was not to use United as his official surname. “But I don’t want to be named after a city in England, I want to wear the name of my favourite football club,” Marin told the court. The struggle continued.When not in court, he was often looking after his cats. He had plenty of them in his back yard in Svishtov and loved them as much as the Red Devils. He named them all after United players: from Rio to Rooney, they were the most famous cats in town. Which was the favourite cat of Man U (as his close friends called him)? A kitty called Beckham.View image in fullscreenMarin bedecked in United gear.Photograph: Family handoutMarin managed another breakthrough in court: he was allowed to add United as an official nickname to his ID card. But still he wasn’t happy. “I won’t stop until my full name is Manchester United,” he vowed. His story soon led to commercial propositions – an offer to have fan merchandise produced under his new name – but despite his financial struggles, he rejected the opportunity because he did not want to profit from his favourite club. The Manchester United name was sacred to him.A documentary followed in 2011. The crew turned Marin’s dream of visiting Old Trafford into reality and there he even met Dimitar Berbatov, the Bulgaria striker playing for United at the time.Marin tattooed the United crest on his forehead three years later as a protest against the court decisions and in his last few years it became more and more difficult for him to continue his legal battle. Job opportunities were scarce and he lost his mother to Covid-19. But somehow, he found a way. Born as a Catholic, he got baptised in an orthodox church under the name Manchester United Zdravkov Levidzhov. “At least God will know me with my real name,” he used to say.This Monday, 13 October, his heart stopped beating. Perhaps now Manchester United’s restless soul could finally find peace.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Am I really turning into an early bird or have I just been forced into a child-dictated schedule?Arwa MahdawiThu 16 Oct 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 12.04 EDTShareWe all know that early birds get the worm. But who wants a worm? Not me.For most of my life I have identified as anight owl, clambering out of bed as late as possible and not so much seizing but reluctantly easing into the day.US work culture is not really optimal for night owls. Rather, it favours CEOs who get up at4amand run a marathon while the rest of us hit the snooze button. Still, I always consoled myself withthe idea that night owls are actually more intelligent and creative than their early bird counterparts. Franz Kafka and Thomas Wolfewroteat bedtime; Bob Dylanrecordedat night. Even scientific studiesindicated it was true.However, something weird has happened. Due to a combination of existential dread, cutting out alcohol and having a small child who wakes me up at an ungodly hour, I’ve started to go to bed earlier and earlier. These days, a 9pm bedtime is perfection. The idea of routinely staying up until the wee hours, as I used to, is now horrifying.This shift has me questioning everything. Is it actually possible for your body clock to change? Am I really turning into an early bird or have I just been forced into a child-dictated schedule? And if I am an early bird, does that make me a lesser being? I went on a mission to settle the owl-versus-lark debate for once and for all.What makes someone an early or late riser?My first discovery: you can’t help who you are; your optimal bedtime is hardwired into you. “We all have an internal biological clock, or a circadian rhythm, that controls numerous physiological outputs, including alertness levels, sleep, hormone levels and blood pressure,” says Kristen Knutson, an associate professor at Northwestern University who specializes in sleep research. Your “chronotype”, meanwhile, is your circadian preference: the scientific way of saying whether you’re a morning lark or night owl. Someone with an early chronotype will naturally find it easier to go to sleep early than someone with a later chronotype.I traded booze for THC drinks. But are there hidden risks?Read moreWhile it is difficult to fundamentally change your chronotype, it does naturally shift as you age. Anyone with a small child will understand why I don’t bother with an alarm clock any more – my four-year-old rudely wakes me up at 5.30am instead. But biological clocks delay as puberty hits, says Knutson: teenagers “have a later chronotype. Then, as we get older, our chronotype tends to drift earlier and earlier. By the time we are in our 80s, we are an early type.”We all go through this same cycle, but from different starting points. “In young adults, morning and evening types can differ by as much as approximately four hours in how their biological clocks affect their behavior,” says Hans Van Dongen, director of the Sleep and Performance Research Center at Washington State UniversityHealthSciences Spokane. It’s not entirely certain why these differences exist but, along with possible evolutionary reasons, there’s probably a genetic component. “Children born to evening-type parents are more likely to be evening types, and likewise for morning types,” says Van Dongen.Is there any evidence night owls are smarter than early birds?Back to that all-important question, though: does being a night owl make you more creative and intelligent?One2007 studyfound “that evening-disposition is correlated with the ability to apply divergent thinking strategies to visual content” – a science-y way of saying “more creative”. In a2009 studycalled “Why night owls are more intelligent”, psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa checked the bedtimes of 20,745 adolescents against the results of an intelligence test. He found people with higher intelligence were more likely to be night owls, and posited that it might be because it’s “evolutionarily novel” to stay up late.More recently, researchers at Imperial College London studied UK data on more than 26,000 people who had completed various intelligence tests. The 2024 paper found that those who stay up late had “superior cognitive function” to morning larks.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’However, all the experts I spoke to were cautious about making definitive links between chronotype and traits like creativity, intelligence or sociability. While they make for good headlines, all of these studies haveimportant limitations.That 2009 study, for example? Van Dongen notes the “analysis is based on how late individuals choose to go to bed … [and] cannot rule out the possibility that adolescents with higher IQ choose to study longer into the night and require more sleeping in for recovery on the weekend, or are involved in more or different after-school activities.”(I emailed Kanazawa, the study’s lead researcher and an academic at the London School of Economics, to get his take on this criticism and got a reply saying: “Yeah, like I’d speak to someone from the Guardian.” It turns out that Kanazawa, whoonce claimedthat a study showed black women to be less attractive than women of other races, is somewhat controversial and definitely not a Guardian fan.)So my beliefs about night owls were built on shaky ground. But the stereotypes of creative geniuses burning the midnight oil and early bird CEOs could still be relevant. “The timing of the biological clock determines more than just when people like to go to bed and get up and when they feel most alert during the day,” says Van Dongen. “It also determines in part the kinds of activities they may end up participating in and the experiences they get exposed to.” If you naturally get up early, it may be easier for you to thrive in a corporate work environment, for example.The dark side of being a night owlOne thing sleep experts all seem to agree on is that trying to force a routine that is at odds with your biological clock is unhealthy. In fact, it could send you to an early grave.In 2018, Knutson, of Northwestern, co-authoreda studythat found night owls have a 10% higher risk of early death and more health problems compared with early risers. The study couldn’t determine the underlying reasons, but Knutson notes the issue may have something to do with “circadian disruption caused by desynchrony between their internal clock and the external world”. In other words, she says, “it is difficult for a night owl to live in a morning lark’s world”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A2024 studyfrom Stanford Medicine researchers found that being up late is not good for your mental health, regardless of chronotype. The reasons are unclear, but researchers suspect it’s because unhealthy behaviours such as drinking alcohol or eating junk food are more likely late at night.Similarly, University of Groningen researcher Ana Wenzler worked on a recent study that found staying up late is linked tocognitive decline. Wenzler notes that at least 25% of the effect was because of lifestyle rather than anything intrinsic; again, you’re more likely to make poor choices late at night.Can you hack your chronotype?While you can’t change your chronotype, you can try to work in harmony with it. But to do that, you first have to understand which type you are, and it’s not always obvious. Looking back, I thought I was a night owl for many years just because of my habits. I was young and went out a lot. Yet once I stopped drinking, my body clock seemed to shift.But it’s not like I’m waking up with the birds like Snow White, ready for the day. In fact, I’ve started to think I’m neither a morning person nor an evening person, but something in the middle. Which, apparently, is possible. According to sleep specialist Dr Michael Breus, someone whose chronotype sits firmly in the middle isa “bear”. And us bears actually dominate: bysome estimates, half the population is in that category.Why do I keep waking up at 2am – and how do I get back to sleep?Read moreSo how do you figure out your natural biological clock? Wenzler says the way to determine a person’s chronotype is to measure the melatonin levels in their saliva “throughout the day to see when the melatonin goes up”. Melatonin is a hormone your body secretes to signal to you that it’s night; morning people release it earlier.Obviously, saliva tests won’t be practical for most people. In the absence of a home science lab, says Wenzler, try sleeping without an alarm for a week. Stay away from depressants and stimulants like alcohol and coffee and avoid artificially extending your natural bedtime by doomscrolling or bingeing TV, and your body will find a natural rhythm. You’ll wake up whenever your body deems best.I would have tried this experiment myself, but you can’t really get rid of your alarm clock when that alarm is a small child.Finally, if you are certain you’re a night owl, but have to get up early for work (or, in my case, entertain a hyperactive four-year-old in the wee hours), can you tweak your biological clock? Sort of!“It’s possible to shift, but usually only modestly,” says Matthew P Walker, director at the Center for HumanSleepScience at the University of California, Berkeley. Walker mentions a 2019 study that “advanced night owls by about two hours in three weeks using structured routines: morning light, fixed mealtimes, earlier exercise and caffeine cutoff. People reported better mood and performance in the mornings, though most drift back if the changes aren’t maintained.“One could not imagine anyone sticking to this regimen in perpetuity,” he adds, and these findings indicate that people should operate in tune with their chronotype, not against it. “Yes – the early bird may catch the worm. But the second mouse gets the cheese!”Now try telling that to your boss.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyThe secrets of sleepSleepHealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks that he may deliver Tomahawks, which would give Kyiv its longest-range weapon yet that would be capable of striking Moscow with accurate, destructive munitions.However, Trump’s conciliatory tone after the call with Putin left in question the likelihood of immediate assistance to Ukraine and reignited European fears of US capitulation to Moscow.Trump said Putin “didn’t like it” when he raised the possibility during their call of giving Ukraine Tomahawks – which have a range of up to 1,500 miles (2,415km) – but then appeared to cast doubt on whether Zelenskyy would actually get the American-made arm, saying the US could not “deplete” its own supply.“We need them too, so I don’t know what we can do about that,” Trump said.View image in fullscreenTwice over the weekend, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke by phone in what the Ukrainian president described as ‘productive’ talks.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APThe US president, fresh from brokering a peace deal in Gaza, has signalled he is eager to build on the momentum of that diplomatic victory by increasing pressure on Moscow to end Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its fourth year.On the eve of Zelenskyy’s visit, Trump said he was planning to meet Putin in the Hungarian capital on a date still to be determined in an effort to end the war. They previously met in Alaska in August, which did not produce a diplomatic breakthrough.In the past, Trump has set deadlines for Moscow and vowed to impose crippling sanctions on Russia’s economy, only to back down. He has frequently softened his stance after speaking to or meeting Putin.While supplying Tomahawks, the idea of which has already annoyed the Kremlin, would be symbolically significant, they are only available in relatively small numbers, estimated by some experts at 20 to 50 missiles.View image in fullscreenTomahawk cruise missiles are usually launched from ships or submarines, which Ukraine does not have.Photograph: US Navy/Getty ImagesTwice over the weekend, Trump and Zelenskyy spoke by phone in what the Ukrainian president described as “productive” talks – a stunning reversal from February’s White House dressing-down that had laid bare the rift between the two leaders.Tomahawks were first used in combat in 1991 and are normally launched from ships and submarines, which Ukraine does not have. They cost an estimated $1.3m (£1m) each and have a range that puts Moscow well within reach, as well as offering far greater destructive power than long-range drones.There is also a relatively new land-launched variant, the Typhon, more obviously suitable for Ukraine, but the launchers are in short supply. The US army is known only to have two, although another launcher, the X-Mav, which is considered more mobile than the Typhon, was demonstrated this week.Tomahawks graphicRob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute,said: “My understanding is that US doesn’t have a lot of Tomahawks. There are launchers that can launch them from the ground, but the military doesn’t have many of them.”Pavel Luzin, an independent Russian military analyst, said: “The Typhon system itself is new, still being produced for the US military. And it’s not just a launcher – it includes transport and reloading vehicles as well as a dedicated command post.”In recent weeks, theTrump administrationalso authorised the sharing of US intelligence to help Ukraine carry out precision strikes on Russia’s oil refineries using domestically produced drones and US-supplied Atacms missiles. These attacks have led to fuel shortages and a sharp rise in gasoline prices across Russia.Politicians and experts believe the cruise missiles could reinforce that strategy, though the missiles are generally considered most effective if launched in salvoes, which would be difficult with limited numbers.On Tuesday, Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, argued they could be particularly effective becauseRussia’s size makes air defence coverage difficult. The Institute for the Study of War estimates that there are 1,900 Russian military targets within range of the longer 1,500-mile plus Tomahawk variant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Russia will shrug it off,” said Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat.Still, the Kremlin has in recent days issued its strongest warnings to Trump since he assumed office – a striking shift in tone for Moscow, where many had expected Washington to help secure a Ukraine settlement favourable towards Russia.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Vladimir Putin met in Alaska in August, but the summit did not produce a diplomatic breakthrough.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersPutin last week warned the US against supplying Tomahawks, saying their transfer would mark a “qualitatively new stage of escalation”.On Thursday, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov struck a similar note, telling the state-run Radio Mayak that the delivery of the cruise missiles to Ukraine “could lead to a qualitatively new level of escalation in the conflict”, adding: “It would be a very serious new step in that direction.”A former senior Russian defence official said Moscow was less worried about the impact of Tomahawks on the battlefield than about what delivery of the weapons would symbolise.“Moscow doesn’t believe Tomahawks will dramatically change the situation on the ground,” they said, speaking on condition of anonymity.“But it would be the clearest sign yet that Putin is losing Trump – and that is deeply concerning for them. Their delivery would cross a red line, after which Trump could feel emboldened to expand US arms supplies to Ukraine.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyRussiaVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer wants to make carrying a digital ID mandatory for anyone wanting or needing to prove their right to work in the UK by the end of this parliament.That plan sparked cross-party opposition and a 2.9 million-signature petition calling for it to be dropped. But the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, this week complained of “scaremongering” and said digital IDs would not be used to track citizens and “there will be no pooling of people’s private information into a single, central dataset”.View image in fullscreenVeterans will be able to hold the credential in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login.Photograph: SuppliedMinisters hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security. Kendall said it “will help remove barriers, reduce red tape and make it easier for people to access the public services they need”.The Royal British Legion, the veterans’ charity that sells poppies, called the card “a positive development” and said it could improve access to services and benefits for the armed forces communities. But other veterans oppose it. Stephen Kent, the media director of Veterans Association UK, a small not-for-profit members’ group, said: “We don’t need it. It’s not for what Labour says it’s for …. A lot of veterans don’t like the idea of it [and that they] are using us as an experiment.”Veterans will be able hold the credential in a smartphone app calledGov.uk One Login. The government had previously said digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be held in an app called the Gov.uk Wallet. It now says it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more government-issued credentials become available digitally.‘Reverse Midas touch’: Starmer plan prompts collapse in support for digital IDsRead moreThe credential will be stored under encryption in the app in a similar way to a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet. Verification by face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it and the government says it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence and when more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app so there is no central database of all ID data creating what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.The Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party have all opposed the digital ID plan. Labour opponents include the MP Richard Burgon, who said it threatened “civil liberties and our data security and [creates] the risk of our data being handed over to US tech giants”.Kendall told parliament on Monday the government “absolutely will not” hand over control of any digital ID system containing information about people’s lives. Ministers have said they expect it to be built by the government’s in-house digital services department. Industry estimates suggest it could cost about £1bn to set up.Kendall also ruled out the system ever allowing the government to track location, consumer spending habits or social media activity. And she said that at no stage in the future would people be required by the police to produce the digital ID. MPs have voiced fears it could be weaponised by future governments.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyIdentity cardsBritish armyMilitaryUK civil libertiesAppsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, while cases involving obstetrics where a child was left with cerebral palsy or other brain damage were fewer in number – 1,016 – they were very costly to settle.They cost £1.6bn to settle, more than four times the next most expensive type of injuries – “other” (£337m) – and paediatrics (£325m).“Despite progress in containing the number of clinical negligence claims in some specialities, the increasing cost of the small number of very high value claims is driving higher costs for taxpayers”, said Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO.Maternity claims cost £11.2m each on average to settle, the NAO revealed. It also disclosed that:the bill for negligence is expected to reach £4.1bn in 2029-30the number of cases settled has more than doubled from 5,625 in 2006-07 to 13,329 in 2024-25the total number of settlements has fallen in 11 specialties but risen in six others“There has been an unacceptable rise in the cost of clinical negligence claims – billions that should have been spent on frontline services, ” a Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said.“From overhauling our broken safety landscape to grasping the serious problems in maternity care, this government is grabbing hold of this problem and taking the decisive action patients and taxpayers deserve.“Our 10-year health plan makes clear that patient safety is the bedrock of a healthy NHS and we are working to ensure we reduce the incidents that lead to claims.”Meanwhile, the total cost of repairing hospitals in England has soared to almost £16bn, NHS figures showed.Woman, 53, becomes UK’s longest survivor of heart and lung transplantRead moreThe disclosure prompted NHS leaders to warn that patients are being put at risk from “decrepit” buildings that in some cases are “falling to bits, literally”.The bill for repairing and properly maintaining the NHS’s stock of hospitals has jumped from £13.8bn last year to £15.9bn – a 16% rise – according to the NHS’s annual estates return information collection dataset.Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of hospitals body NHS Providers, said: “Critical parts of the NHS are falling to bits, literally, after years of underinvestment nationally. The safety of patients and staff is at risk.“We can’t keep wasting money propping up ageing buildings not fit for purpose.”Siva Anandaciva, director of policy at the King’s Fund thinktank, said the £15.9bn figure is “more than the entire capital budget for this year and £2.2bn higher than last year”.“Decrepit NHS buildings have a real and detrimental impact on patient care, with regular examples of flooded corridors, reduced theatre capacity and roofs at risk of falling in,” he added.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Downing Street argued that it would have been “frankly absurd” for the prime minister to intervene when he was told a few days in advance that the case was on the brink of collapse.Chris Philp, the Conservative shadow home secretary, also wrote to Parkinson demanding he release all the correspondence the CPS exchanged with the government about its evidence.The row concerns the decision to abandon a prosecution under the 1911 Official Secrets Act against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher for the Conservative MPs Alicia Kearns and Tom Tugendhat, and Christopher Berry, a teacher, on 15 September.View image in fullscreenChristopher Cash, left, and Christopher Berry were the two men accused of spying for Beijing.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesThe CPS said previously it had dropped the case because the government had not provided sufficient evidence that China represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”, a definition required by the espionage legislation, which has since been repealed.On Wednesday, Starmerpublished the three witness statementssubmitted by Collins in an attempt to dispel claims that the government had a hand in disrupting the trial.But the prime minister still faces questions over why he did not step in to stop the case from being dropped over the contents of the government’s evidence. Parkinson told committee chairs at a private meeting on Wednesday that the evidence was just 5% off what was required, having said earlier that prosecutors tried for “many months” to obtain what was needed.Ministers have also faced questions over why the final statement submitted by Collins echoed theLabourgovernment’s policy towards China, despite Starmer’s insistence throughout that the collapsed case relied upon the previous Tory government’s stance. Downing Street said Collins had included the line at his own initiative to provide context about the current government policy.The joint committee on the national security strategy (JCNSS) and the intelligence and security committee (ISC) will bothhold inquiries into the matter, which will have the power to compel ministers, prosecutors and government and intelligence officials to give evidence.Unlike select committees, the ISC has statutory powers to compel witnesses. Its chair, Lord Beamish, said it had “received the intelligence background behind the case” and now planned to “investigate how that classified material was then used”.The government is still pushing ahead with its reset in UK-China relations, with severalhigh-level trips planned this yearincluding another by the national security adviser, Jonathan Powell. Plans are being drawn up for Starmer to make a bilateral visit to China next year.China said spying allegations contained in the evidence from Collins were false and that it never interferes in other countries’ internal affairs. An embassy spokesperson added: “The so-called ‘witness statements’ released after the CPS dropped the case are rife with unfounded accusations against China. They are nothing but sheer fabrications made out of thin air.”The Guardian view on UK national security: a case of state failure | EditorialRead moreA crunch decision over whether to approve controversial proposals for a huge Chinese embassy in east London was delayed for the second time, and will now be taken on or before 10 December.The head of MI5 signalled he was relatively relaxed about the embassy proposal, which could clear the way for ministers to approve it despite vehement opposition from critics. “MI5 has more than a century of experience of dealing with the national security risks, which do flow from the presence of foreign embassies on British soil,” McCallum said.He said MI5 and sister agency GCHQ had the available counter-espionage expertise and were advising ministers on how to handle the development. “You would expect us to give our best professional security advice to government and you would expect us to keep that advice private,” he said.However, Matt Western, the chair of the JCNSS, wrote to the government on Monday warning that approving the embassy was “not in the UK’s long-term interest”.In a letter to Steve Reed, the housing secretary, who is responsible for taking the decision, Western said the proposed location of the outpost posed “eavesdropping risks in peacetime and sabotage risks in a crisis” owing to its proximity to fibre-optic cables, datacentres and telecoms exchanges serving Canary Wharf and the City.The Guardian revealed last year that China was blocking the much-neededredevelopment of Britain’s embassy in Beijingwhile the fate of its own proposed embassy was being decided. The refurbishment of Britain’s embassy is increasingly a pressing concern in parts of government.Explore more on these topicsEspionageChinaKeir StarmerCrown Prosecution ServiceJonathan PowellChris PhilpMI5newsShareReuse this content"

Aid agencies sayopening Rafah, which has been controlled by Israel since May last year, is critical for bringing sufficient humanitarian assistance into the territory.“We need more fuel to go intoGaza, we need more food, more medical equipment, medications, medics, doctors,” said Hanan Balkhy, the regional director for the WHO, echoing demands by international leaders for Israel to allow in a massive increase of aid.View image in fullscreenA ‘welcome back home’ sign is illuminated in Habima Square, Tel Aviv.Photograph: Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesIsrael accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement by failing to return the remains of deceased hostages. On Monday, Hamas returned the last 20 surviving hostages but handed back only nine of 28 deceased captives, saying it would need specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the rest from the ruins ofGaza.US advisers working on the implementation of Donald Trump’s ceasefire deal, and the Red Cross, have said there are significant practical difficulties in recovering remains of hostages amid the devastation caused by Israel’s offensive during the past 24 months.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said on Thursday he was determined to ensure Hamas handed back the remains of hostages still in Gaza, adding that the fight “is not over yet”. Speaking at a state ceremony for soldiers killed in the two-year conflict, Netanyahu said Israel would achieve all its war aims and that its enemies had “learned that anyone who lifts a hand against it will pay a heavy price”.A senior Hamas official accused Israel of breaking the ceasefire by killing at least 24 people in shootings since Friday, and said a list of such incidents had been handed over to mediators. “The occupying state is working day and night to undermine the agreement through its violations on the ground,” he said.1:17Gaza humanitarian aid trucks wait to cross intro strip – videoThe Israeli military did not immediately respond but has previously said some Palestinians have ignored warnings not to approach Israeli ceasefire positions and that troops “opened fire to remove the threat”.Regional diplomats and US officials have sought to minimise the significance of the accusations, emphasising thatHamasand Israel still appear committed to the ceasefire. Trump’s 20-point plan includes “full aid” reaching Gaza, wherea famine was declared in some areas in August, as well as the return of all the Israeli hostages, dead and alive.Pope Leo XIV denounced the use of hunger as a weapon of war during an address to a UN agency on Thursday, but did not name any specific conflict or region. Aid workers in Gaza described Israel’s continuing restrictions on aid entering Gaza as “collective punishment”.Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti assaulted by Israeli prison guards, son saysRead moreBalkhy warned that infectious diseases were “spiralling out of control” in Gaza, with only 13 of the Palestinian territory’s 36 hospitals even partially functioning. “Whether meningitis … diarrhoea, respiratory illnesses, we’re talking about a mammoth amount of work,” she said.A spokesperson for Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, suggested that Rafah would remain closed to aid in the future, although individual passage would be allowed. “It should be emphasised that humanitarian aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing. This was never agreed upon at any stage,” it said, adding that aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip through other crossingsUN officials said on Thursday that the ongoing delays had allowed them to clear more aid with Israeli officials in preparation for when crossings reopen.Stéphane Dujarric, a UN spokesperson, said a total of 200,000 metric tons of aid had been approved for entry into Gaza for when officials receive the green light to continue their work, and that the aid that was able to make it into the territory on Sunday, including more than a million nappies, was being quickly distributed to Palestinians by various UN agencies.View image in fullscreenTrucks carrying food aid and fuel, accompanied by a UN team, pass through the Kerem Shalom border crossing on Wednesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesRegional officials told the Guardian they expected the first days and weeks of the ceasefire to be “tense” and “scratchy”, with aid and the return of the remains of hostages among the key issues. Much of Trump’s plan, including many of the most difficult issues, has yet to be fully discussed by negotiating teams.On Monday, Israel freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israeli jails. This figure includes 1,700 Palestinians who were seized from Gaza during the war and held without charge.The ceasefire deal also requires Israel to return the bodies of 360 Palestinians. The Gaza health ministry said it had received 30 more bodies of Palestinians on Thursday, bringing the total to 120 since last Friday. Doctors at Nasser hospital said the bodiesshowed signs of torture and execution, including blindfolds, cuffed hands and bullet wounds in the head, according to doctors’ accounts.“Almost all of them had been blindfolded, and had been bound up, and they had gunshots between the eyes. Almost all of them had been executed,” said Dr Ahmed al-Farra, the head of Nasser hospital’s paediatric department in Khan Younis.Trump has said he would consider allowing Israeli forces to resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas failed to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal. “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word. If Israel could go in and knock the crap of them, they’d do that,” the US president was quoted on Wednesday as saying to CNN in a brief telephone call when asked what would happen if Hamas refused to disarm.In Israel, there have been fierce debates over the fate of the hostages. Arbel Yehud, who was held in captivity for nearly 500 days before being freed under a previous deal in January, said on Wednesday that all the hostages could have returned home “a long time ago”.Speaking at a press conference alongside families of newly freed hostages, including her partner, Ariel Cunio, who was released this week, Yehud said the deal brokered by Trump could have been struck earlier, in turn saving the lives of more hostages. “While we are here, fortunate to embrace our loved ones, there are dozens of families that never will,” said Yehud.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warHamasPalestineIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It felt like a classic album, one that will take pride of place in record collections for years to come.”Fender, 31, grew up in North Shields, close to where the award ceremony was held this year, inNewcastle.He broke through quickly with his debut album Hypersonic Missiles in 2019, which topped the UK album chart, then consolidated its epic yet poignant sound on second album Seventeen Going Under (2021), and again with People Watching, released in February.It has taken him to even greater commercial heights, producing two Top 10 singles and prompting a series of stadium concerts.Accepting the award to the sound of Newcastle United chants in the crowd, Fender said: “We did not expect this at all … I want to say thank you, because I never did, to the person the song People Watching is about: Annie Orwin, who’s up there.”Fender has previously described Orwin, an actor, as “like a surrogate mother” to him, and the lyrics of the song People Watching reflect on his visits to see her in the care home where she eventually died in 2023. He performed the song at the ceremony.This year’s Mercury prize shortlist featured a number of commercially successful albums alongside somewhat lesser-known names.People Watching, Wolf Alice’s The Clearing and Pulp’s comeback album More all topped the UK album chart, while CMAT’s Euro-Country, FKA twigs’ Eusexua, Fontaines DC’s Romance and PinkPantheress’s Fancy That all reached the Top 3. Bookmakers had CMAT as the favourite, followed byFontaines DCand Pulp.Also nominated were Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon, rapper Pa Salieu, jazz-funk artist Emma-Jean Thackray, and Welsh jazz pianist Joe Webb.View image in fullscreenMartin Carthy on the Mercury prize’s red carpet.Photograph: JMEnternational/Getty ImagesThe prize also had its oldest ever nominee: English folk singerMartin Carthy, 84, recognised for his album Transform Me Then Into a Fish.Carthy’s career stretches back to the early 1960s London, where he influenced Bob Dylan, teaching him the standard Scarborough Fair. He later made recordings with his wife, Norma Waterson, and their daughter Eliza Carthy followed them into folk music, earning two Mercury prize nominations of her own in 1998 and 2003.Martin and Eliza performed a version of Scarborough Fair together, with sitar player Sheema Mukherjee, at the ceremony. Alon, Fender,FKA twigs, Pulp, Salieu, Thackray, Webb and Wolf Alice each also performed a song live.CMAT was also in attendance, but did not perform due to recent treatment to two wisdom teeth. “I was thinking about making jewellery from them,” she told BBC 6 Music. “I want to make the other nominees kiss my teeth for good luck, but not tell them it’s my good luck.”Wolf Alice became the first act to be nominated for each of their first four albums. Both they andPulphave one win from four nominations.In 2024, the Mercury prize seemed to be in a somewhat parlous state, after it failed to secure an event sponsor and had to make do with a scaled-back awards show without live performances.But it has returned strongly in 2025, relocating to Newcastle and using the city’s Utilita Arena as a venue. It also hosted an array of “Mercury fringe” events in the days prior to the award ceremony, with artist showcases, workshops and panel discussions.Guardian analysisof recent winners found that between 2014 and 2023, every winner hailed from London, with Leeds band English Teacher finally bringing a win from outside the capital in 2024.The move to Newcastle, which helps to counter a generally London-centric music industry, has therefore been praised. Ian Murray, minister for creative industries, media and arts, said the “symbolic step” was “hugely welcome … for too long other regions have had to play second fiddle to London, despite having world-class creative output in their own right”.View image in fullscreenSam Fender and band celebrate their win.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThe Mercury prize is voted for by a team of music industry figures: jazz musician and broadcaster Jamie Cullum; radio DJs Sian Eleri, Jamz Supernova, Mistajam, and Danielle Perry; journalists Phil Alexander, Will Hodgkinson and Sophie Williams; music consultant Lea Stonhill; and the chair of the judges, Jeff Smith, head of music at BBC Radio 2 and Radio 6 Music.The prize, founded in 1992, is described as a “celebration of the 12 albums of the year, recognising artistic achievement across a range of contemporary music genres”. The most nominated artists are Radiohead and Arctic Monkeys, each with five, while PJ Harvey is the only artist to have won it twice.Fender wins £25,000 prize money. The judges’ statement added that People Watching is “melody-rich and expansive, marrying heartland rock with the realities of everyday life and the importance of community. These are thoughtful songs with broad appeal, as cinematic as they are intimate.”Explore more on these topicsMercury prizeAwards and prizesSam FenderPulpCMATFontaines DCFKA twigsnewsShareReuse this content"

We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others.“The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension.

He is and will always be a part of Kiss’s legacy,” they said, paying tribute to “all those who loved him, including our fans around the world”.Criss wrote on X: “I’m shocked!!! My friend ... I love you!”Frehley reportedly fell in his recording studio and hit his head in late September. He was hospitalised for several weeks and put on life support after suffering a brain bleed.His injuries initially forced him to cancel a concert date in California. Days later, the rest of his 2025 tour was cancelled due to “some ongoing health issues”.View image in fullscreenAce Frehley, pictured performing live onstage during a cover session for the Kiss Alive! album.Photograph: Fin Costello/RedfernsWhen Kiss released their self-titled debut album in 1974, critics were mostly cold, but the band quickly became famous and loved by their fans for their wild live shows, white and black makeup and leather costumes, inspired by the New York Dolls and Alice Cooper. Each member had a different persona, with Frehley being the Spaceman (or “Space Ace”), Simmons the Demon, Stanley the Starchild and Criss the Catman.In keeping with the band’s theatrics, Frehley was known for playinga trademarked, modified Les Paul,which was designed to fill the stage with smoke during his guitar solos. He never took a guitar lesson, saying in a 2009 interview: “I’m an anomaly, I’m an un-schooled musician. I don’t know how to read music, but I’m one of the most famous guitar players in the world, so go figure.”When all four members of Kiss released solo albums on the same day in 1978, it was Frehley’s that sold best, with his cover of Russ Ballard’s songNew York Groovebecoming a hit.The band members’ faces were not revealed for more than a decade; by this time, Frehley had left Kiss, having moved on to a solo career in 1982 after feeling conflicted about the band’s direction and struggling with substance abuse. “I was mixed up,” he later said of this period. “I believed that if I stayed in that group, I would have [killed myself]. I’d be driving home from the studio, and I’d want to drive my car into a tree.”In 1984, Frehley formed a new band, Frehley’s Comet, which released two studio albums but failed to take off. Frehley reverted to using his own name for his 1989 album Trouble Walkin’, which featured backing vocals from Criss.Frehley rejoined Kiss when the original members of the band reunited in 1996 for a hugely successful reunion tour, and stayed until 2002. However, whenKiss went on their farewell world tour in 2022 and 2023, Frehley did not join them. In his later years, he had an adversarial relationship with Simmons, who madeseveral comments in the pressabout Frehley’s past substance abuse.Kiss’ final tour review – a glorious, absurd triumph from kings of rock’n’roll theatreRead moreIn 2019, when Simmons claimed Frehley was actually fired from Kiss due to his drug use, Frehley addressed Simmons in a public statement, saying he had been sober for 12 years and that he quit Kiss “of my own free will, because you and Paul [Stanley] are control freaks, untrustworthy and were too difficult to work with”.Pearl Jam guitaristMike McCready paid tribute, recalling how he first learned about Frehley at 11, when a friend got a Kiss lunchbox and it “changed my life”.“All my friends have spent untold hours talking about Kiss and buying Kiss stuff. Ace was a hero of mine and also I would consider a friend. I studied his solos endlessly over the years,” McCready wrote, adding that playing with Frehley at Madison Square Garden was “a dream come true for me”.“I would not have picked up a guitar without Ace and Kiss’s influence,” he wrote. “RIP it out Ace, you changed my life.”Poison frontman Bret Michaelswrote on X: “Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we’ve done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time. All my love and respect, from my family and myself - may you rest in peace!!!”Frehley is survived by his wife, Jeanette, and daughter Monique.Explore more on these topicsKissPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Here is alink to the videoinstead.London Bridge's new station clockThe railway, 200 years old this year, played a pivotal role in creating a unified national time zone, with cities previously setting their own clocks by the sun; Bristol remained 10 minutes behindLondonfor some decades before the demands of fast trains and a railway timetable made it catch up.London Bridge was chosen for the prestigious first clock and ceremonial opening as it was the second station in 1852 to have an electronic clock linked by telegraph to the Greenwich Observatory (the first was Lewisham, earlier that year).The design, chosen in an international competition for architects and designers, was selected for ease of reading as well as reflecting the railways’ brand. Mark Wood, a creative partner at the winning agency, Design Bridge and Partners, said he hoped it would become “the face of time across the railway for many years to come”.View image in fullscreenLondon Bridge was chosen for the prestigious first clock as it was the second station in 1852 to have an electronic clock linked by telegraph to the Greenwich Observatory.Photograph: Matt Crossick/PAThe new clock at London Bridge features only hours and minutes in numerals, with seconds represented by the “double arrow” of the British Rail logo – splitting in two before circling the face as if on opposing tracks, rejoining hypnotically every minute. According to the designers, “this subtle yet powerful visual metaphor speaks to the constant flow and convergence of journeys”.After thegarish advertising boards at Euston, could this once again risk passengers missing their train? The Network Rail chief executive, Andrew Haines, was quick to dispel suggestions the rebrand would signal a more relaxed attitude to time. “There will be seconds displayed in full on platforms,” he said. “As a railwayman, there was no way I was having a clock without seconds.”While the success of the clock will be measured over decades, some are already enthusiastic. Gerry Barney, who created the old British Rail logo in 1965, was approached by the clock’s designers and pronounced himself “thrilled … what [they] have created is really magic”.At London Bridge, Tim Dunn, a rail historian, said of the design: “When I first saw, it I cried.” (In a good way.)Most of Great Britain’s major rail operators are back in public hands – is it working?Read moreA pop-up shop at the mainline station was selling expensive rail-branded merchandise and the swish design of the clock face could be another design hit, the rail industry hopes. An app is planned to allow smartwatch wearers to download the clock face for their own wrists.Hendy, who was proudly sporting a (borrowed) smartwatch with the new design, said that as the government continues in its labours to rebuild a nationalised, integrated railway for passengers, “good design, like this brilliant, clever timepiece, is a fundamental part of achieving this”.The unified design would make stations instantly recognisable, following a plethora of different clocks after rail was privatised and fragmented, the rail minister said.Hendy, who has worked for many years alongside Haines who is retiring on Thursday – fittingly, after the clock presentation – said they could be pleased if this was their legacy: “If people know where they are and what time it is, we’ll have done something good.”Explore more on these topicsRail transportTransportLondonRail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, they shared personal stories of having been victimized by leftwing protesters.“Their job”, the extremism researcher Jared Holt saidon his podcast, “is to make these viral clips that they can show on Fox News and scare your grandpa into thinking antifa is on the verge of a mass slaughter, and that Mr Trump is the only man who can put an end to this by sending the military to go crack some skulls”.Eleven conservative influencers endorsed Donald Trump’s planned crackdown on antifascists in a White House video.Here is a guide to the conservative media activists whose work fills the president’s head with visions of antifa.Andy NgoNgo is a video journalist turned pundit with 1.7 million followers on X.View image in fullscreenAndy Ngo at the White House.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersSince Donald Trump first shouted the word “antifa” at a rally in 2017, a week after he accused antifascists of “violently attacking” white supremacists at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, no one has done more than Andy Ngo to promote the myth that black-clad protesters around the nation are part of a secret terrorist network.Ngo, the son of Vietnamese refugees in Portland, made his name on Twitter by posting video clips, often misleadingly edited or captioned, of street battles that broke out when far-right groups from surrounding counties descended on the liberal city to provoke antifascists.His willingness to selectively edit his reports to blame antifascists for the violence wasrevealedin 2019, when video recorded by an antifascist mole in a rightwing group Ngo had embedded with, Patriot Prayer, showed that Ngo had witnessed, and chosen not to report, the Christian nationalists planning to instigate violence at a leftwing gathering.A month later,Ngo was attackedby antifascists while filming their efforts to counter a Proud Boys rally in Portland. He was punched, kicked and doused with silly string and a milkshake he later claimed had been laced with quick-drying cement. (That accusation appears to have been a false rumor shared with the police by a rightwing activist who wascaught on camerathe same day dousing antifascists with grey powder.)That assault instantly made him a sought-after guest on Fox News. Two years later, he published Unmasked: Inside Antifa’s Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy, a best-selling book filled with exaggerated or inaccurate claims about leftwing protesters.Ngo’s use of the term “domestic terrorists” to describe antifa, nowamplifiedin official US government statements, is not just inaccurate, it can be dangerous. In 2022, a Portland resident who followed Ngo on YouTube went to the site of a planned racial justice march Ngo had railed against, screamed that antifascist volunteers protecting the marchers were “terrorists” andopened fire. The rightwing gunman shot four traffic safety volunteers and a protest medic. One woman died at the scene, another succumbed to her injuries later.Katie DaviscourtDaviscourt is a video correspondent for the Post Millennial with 260,000 followers on X.View image in fullscreenKatie Daviscourt was invited to film protesters from the roof of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, Oregon this month.Photograph: John Rudoff/ReutersKatie Daviscourt, a former Turning Point USA activist, is a correspondent for Post Millennial, a far-right Canadian website where Andy Ngo is an editor. A Portland police sergeant recently described her in an internal report as one of the “counter-protesters” filming protests outside a Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement office who “constantly return and antagonize the protesters until they are assaulted or pepper sprayed”. A week later, Daviscourt wasstruck by a protesterwho tried to block her from filming by swinging a Palestinian flag in her face.The next night, sheappeared on Fox Newswith a black eye to accuse Portland police officers who spent 2020battling with antifascistsof being part of antifa. “The Trump administration needs to start treating antifa like Isis, the terrorists that they are, and put an end to them for good,” shetold Jesse Watters.Nick SortorSortor is an influencer who confronts protesters and Democrats for his 1.2 million X followers.View image in fullscreenRightwing influencer Nick Sortor showed off the partially burned American flag he took from a protester in Portland at the White House.Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesNick Sortor, a former real estate agent from Kentucky, made his name during the Biden administration by going to the scenes of disasters, in East Palestine, Ohio, and Lahaina, Maui, to scream at officials and push conspiracy theories in interviews with Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon.In February,he claimedthat Elizabeth Warren, the 76-year-old Massachusetts senator, has “assaulted” him as she pushed past him to get into her car while he was peppering her with questions based on viral misinformation.Sortor has been involved in multiple physical altercations with protesters in Portland this month, some of whichhe clearly initiated. Video shot by a Fox News correspondent one nightshowedSortor ripping a burning American flag from the hands of an elderly protester he later described as an “Antifa thug”. Later that night, Sortor was arrestedafter exchanging blowswith protesters, whoreportedlyobjected to him filming closeup images of a teenage girl who had just beenmaced by a federal officer.The charges against Sortor were later dropped by a local prosecutor after his arrest prompted an outcry in the conservative media. Sortor received a sympathetic text from Trump and a phone call from the attorney general, Pam Bondi, who ordered the head of the justice department’s civil rights division, Harmeet Dhillon, toopen an investigationof the Portland police bureau over supposed anti-conservative bias. Dhillon was previously Andy Ngo’s lawyer.Julio RosasRosas is a correspondent for Glenn Beck’s Blaze TV with 230,000 followers on X.View image in fullscreenJulio Rosas, a correspondent for Blaze TV.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APJulio Rosas got his start working for Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA,writinglast month that meeting the conservative activist “is THE reason why I have my career in politics today”.The marine reservist spent much of 2020 filmingundercover video of racial justice protests, highlighting rare instances of violence in clips that helped Fox News and the Trump White House frame demonstrations that were about94%entirely peaceful as anarchic.Rosas’s openly partisan approach to covering protests was reflected in his comment to Trump that the “sustained political violence that we’re seeing in this country is not a ‘both sides’ issue”.Rosas did not tell the president that, in previous years, he had filmed two infamous acts of rightwing political violence:Kyle Rittenhouse shooting two people, one fatally, in 2020; and Trump supportershurling a metal barricadeinto the doors of the Capitol,striking police officers, andattacking journalistson 6 January 2021.Savanah HernandezHernandez is a contributor to Turning Point USA and a former Infowars host with 700,000 followers on X.View image in fullscreenSavanah Hernandez, a former Infowars host now with Turning Point USA, lambasted White House reporters during a roundtable on antifa on Wednesday.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersSavanah Hernandez, a former host for the far-right, conspiracy theory outlet Infowars nowcreating videos in Portlandfor Turning Point USA, wascelebrated on Fox Newsin the summer of 2020 for a stunt in which she had herself filmedholding up a signthat read “Police Lives Matter” during a Black Lives Matter protest that followed the murder of George Floyd.At the White House roundtable, she directed her rage at reporters from the White House pool covering the roundtable. “The same media that’s sitting in this room with us, has declared all of us at this table Nazis and fascists, and they’ve been doing this for years,” Hernandez said. “This is why Antifa feels emboldened to attack us.”What Hernandez was apparently not aware of is that, since the Trump administration now selects members of the press pool to be admitted to events with the president, many of the people she was yelling at actually worked for pro-Trump outlets.Cam HigbyHigby is a Turning Point USA media activist with 190,000 followers on X.View image in fullscreenThe Turning Point USA influencer Cam Higby criticized the media during a roundtable on at the White House.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APCam Higby is a Turning Point USA activist who got his start creating videos for PragerU, a rightwing media outlet that promotes climate-crisis denialism and soft-pedals the brutal reality of American slavery in educational films now approved for use in K-12 schools in 10 states.In recent weeks, Higby hasspent time in Portland, but has also been emulating Turning Point’s murdered founder Charlie Kirk, by setting up tables on college campuses and challenging students to debate him.At the White House roundtable, however, Higby cast himself as a reporter unfairly targeted by antifa. “I’m attacked every time I do my job. When I leave my house to go to work, I’m violently assaulted. I’ve had guns pulled on me. I’ve been bear-sprayed. I’ve been beaten down. I’ve been almost killed,”he said.Nick ShirleyShirley is a YouTube influencer with 880,000 subscribers.View image in fullscreenThe pro-Trump influencer Nick Shirley at a protest against Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in New York last month.Photograph: John Taggart/EPANick Shirley, 23, started out making prank videos during his high school years in Utah but last year he began to make YouTube videos aimed at boosting Donald Trump.In February 2024, Shirley recorded himself asking migrants if they supported Joe Biden and shared video on X of several saying they did with the caption: “Confirmed: Migrants for Biden 2024”. Three months later, Shirley hired Latino day laborers at a Home Depot parking lot and paid them $20 each to appear in a video holding signs outside the White House with the slogans: “I Love Biden” and “I Need Work Permit for My Family.”Last month, he produceda friendly profileof the English racist organizer Tommy Robinson, and calleda protest he attendedin Paris an “antifa riot”.Shirley has been in Portland in recent weeks, making a video he titled, “Portland has Fallen... ANTIFA Take Control of City”, andtelling Fox Newsthat Oregon’s governor, who refused to give him an interview during a protest march, had “sided with antifa”.Jonathan ChoeChoe is a Turning Point USA correspondent with 180,000 followers on X.View image in fullscreenInfluencer Jonathan Choe spoke during a roundtable with Donald Trump on antifa in the White House.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APJonathan Choe, now a Turning Point USA correspondent, wasfired from his jobas a reporter for the ABC affiliate in Seattle in 2022 for producingwhat looked likea promotional video for the Proud Boys, set to a song by a white supremacist, in his spare time.In addition to reporting on leftwing protests for rightwing outlets, he covers homelessness in Seattle as a fellow at the Discovery Institute, a Christian conservative thinktank .In May, Choe was filmedstriking a protester in the facewith a baton and then insisting to police that he was the victim. “He assaulted me,” Choe shouted, in video recorded by Daviscourt.Last week in Portland, Choefilmeda man he identified as “Maga patriot Thomas Allen” punching a protester and knocking them to the ground during a skirmish initiated by Sortor. When Allen was then arrested by the police, Choe suggested it was unjust because “antifa militants” had earlier in the night briefly seized Allen’s red Maga cap.Allen was arraigned last week for misdemeanor assault.James KlugKlug is a Turning Point USA ambassador with 617,000 YouTube subscribers.View image in fullscreenJames Klug attends last week’s roundtable on antifa at the White House.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APJames Klug is affiliated with Turning Point USA and known for videos in which he argues with and mocks liberals.On inauguration day 2021, Klug offered his followersa behind-the-scenes lookat how influencers like Rosas go undercover to capture violence at leftwing protests in the city and then appear on Fox News to put all the blame on antifa.The violence in that case was from a small group of anarchists who smashed windows at the Oregon Democratic party’s headquarters in Portland, as Joe Biden was sworn in as president.Rosastold Laura Ingrahamon Fox it was the work of antifa, although Rose City Antifa, the Portland group that helped revive the Nazi-era concept of antifascist organizing, said ina statementthis was an anarchist action antifascists played no part in.Brandi KruseKruse is a former local TV reporter from Seattle who has 165,000 followers on X.View image in fullscreenBrandi Kruse scolded White House reporters during a roundtable on antifa.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersBrandi Kruse, a Republican podcaster who quit her job as a reporter for Seattle’s local Fox affiliate in 2021, recentlyspent 48 hours in Portlandfor her podcast, a city she subsequently described as a “shithole”. She told Trump that she was a former critic who now endorsed him.Kruse also claimed the president’s antifascist rhetoric had already had an effect. “I genuinely believe there would be people at these tables who would be dead today, and would have been killed in Portland, had you not called them a terror organization and said we’re going to bring the full weight of the federal government to bear.”Jack PosobiecPosobiec, who has 3.2 million followers, hosts a podcast sponsored by Turning Point USAView image in fullscreenThe far-right influencer Jack Posobiec was a featured speaker at the memorial for Charlie Kirk last month.Photograph: Ross D Franklin/APJack Posobiec, a former One America News host who left the fringe cable channel to start a show on the far-right network Real America’s Voicesponsored byTurning Point USA, is best known for promoting the Pizzagate conspiracy theory.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rizzello, then in her late 40s, had assumed it was menopausal weight gain, but agreed to go to her GP. “A smart locum said: ‘There’s something wrong here,’ and sent me for a blood test … And that saved my life.”It was the worst news: Rizzello had stage 3 ovarian cancer that had begun to spread. She would need to begin chemotherapy immediately and prepare for the complete removal of her uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes and omentum, a procedure that would put her into immediate menopause.It was the summer of 2012 and her husband, a chef, was working at one of the Olympic venues in Windsor, near to their then home in Slough. For Rizzello, however, “that whole summer was a blur” of painful treatment, including a clinical trial that was so tough, she was told, that many others had been unable to see it through.Six months later, the marketing consultant was told her cancer had gone. “But I was never the same. It was massive. It was an earth-shaking experience that really shook my confidence to the core.”Rizzello, now 60, was lucky, but she does not believe her cancer was just “one of those things” – she believes it was caused by talc.View image in fullscreenJohnson & Johnson continued to sell its talc products in the UK until 2023.Photograph: Dan Peled/AAPShe is one of about 3,000 British-based people – overwhelmingly women – who on Thursday broughta landmark legal actionin the high court in London against the pharmaceuticals company Johnson & Johnson, claiming they or a family member contracted cancer after a lifetime using J&J’s baby powder.Backed by a specialist law firm, the claimants argue that the US-based multinational knew for decades that its talc products might contain dangerous asbestos but failed to warn consumers and carried on selling the products in the UK until 2023.J&J denies the allegations. A spokesperson for Kenvue, J&J’s former consumer health division that was spun off two years ago, said the talc used in baby powder complied with regulations, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.Rizzello says she was in the dark about the origin of her disease, after genetic tests showed she did not carry the BRCA genes that significantly increase the risk of ovarian cancer. “And then I found out about the talc claims, and I thought, hang on.”“I’ve used talc all my life. I mean, when I was a child, everybody did,” she says, whether after swimming or after a bath. “It was just always there. It was just always something you use. I’m totally convinced this was the cause of my own illness, and all the nightmare of treatment and trials that followed.”J&J has been the subject of long-running lawsuits in the US over similar allegations of cancer links to talc, which it wholly disputes. Two years ago it spun off its consumer health division as Kenvue, which has responsibility for talc-related claims outside the US and Canada.Kenvue said: “We sympathise deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers – that’s why the facts are so important. The high-quality cosmetic-grade talc that was used in Johnson’s Baby Powder was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.”Two years ago, to mark the 10-year anniversary of being given the all clear, Rizzello asked friends to sponsor her to shave her hair again to raise money for cancer charities, in memory of others with the disease who did not survive. “I felt I really had to do something,” she says. “Many of the women I’ve met along the way had died, and so I always feel like it’s for them as much as it is for me.“I value some things much more highly than I did before. I think I’ve always dreaded the idea of getting older. I don’t mind getting older now, and I’m so grateful to have a chance to get older.”Explore more on these topicsJohnson & JohnsonHealthCancerPharmaceuticals industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A-Ha!ByChris TryhornThu 16 Oct 2025 08.46 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 10.29 EDTShare20.The Wind in the Willows(1996)Steve Coogan entered the unofficial British comedy hall of fame at the tender age of 30, when he joined four of the Pythons and the likes of Stephen Fry and Victoria Wood in this largely forgotten version of the classic children’s tale. Bedecked in a long scarf and wearing rimless specs, he puts in a respectably twitchy turn as Mole alongside Eric Idle’s Rat and Terry Jones’s Toad.19.Night at the Museum films(2006-2014)In the comedy franchise about museum exhibits coming to life at night, Coogan plays Octavius, a miniature Roman general. Although it is, quite literally, a small part, Coogan makes the most of sharing the screen with Robin Williams, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson – “We may be small, but our hearts are large … metaphorically speaking!” he bellows at Stiller’s security guard.View image in fullscreenAs Octavius, with Owen Wilson’s Jedediah, in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Allstar18.Hamlet 2(2008)Sold for $10m at Sundance, this quirky high-school comedy in the tradition of Rushmore and Election was tipped to be the vehicle that would crack America for Coogan. Instead, it flopped badly and went straight to DVD in the UK. It’s not hard to see why: it’s a bizarre, misfiring story of a drama teacher with daddy issues who stages an ill-advised sequel to Hamlet. Coogan throws everything at it and squeezes out some laughs – the highlight being the Rock Me, Sexy Jesus song in which he prances about in a vest – but he just can’t make it all come together.17.Tropic Thunder(2008)Released in the same month as Hamlet 2, Ben Stiller’s ambitious but exhausting satire put Coogan alongside some bona fide Hollywood heavyweights: Stiller himself, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black and even Tom Cruise. As Damien Cockburn, the floundering British director of an over-budget Vietnam war movie, Coogan seems out of place in this bombastic, largely unfunny film, with his character making an explosive early exit.16.The Penguin Lessons(2024)Based on the memoir by Tom Michell (wholast week deniedhistoric sexual abuse allegations), this eccentric drama sees Coogan embracing late middle age as a depressed school teacher who rescues a penguin during the dark days of Argentina’s military dictatorship. His sombre, dignified performance saves this jarringly sentimental film, scripted by regular collaborator Jeff Pope, from cloying too badly.View image in fullscreenCoogan in The Penguin Lessons.Photograph: Sony Pictures/Everett/Shutterstock15.The Parole Officer(2001)Coogan oncesaid in an interview withthe Guardian that just thinking about this ludicrous Ealing-style caper makes him “squirm”. It certainly wasn’t a worthy vehicle for a TV comedian at the height of his powers, but it’s still quite a fun way to spend 90 minutes. Coogan’s poorly conceived character is a big part of the problem: he’s a mild-mannered, liberal probation officer who somehow organises a bank heist to expose a bent copper.14.Marie Antoinette(2006)Securing the prestigious “and” billing in the credits, Coogan plays the Austrian ambassador to the French court in Sofia Coppola’s divisive period drama. He doesn’t have much to do but advise the young queen (Kirsten Dunst) to hurry up and get pregnant, but he shows he can handle a fully straight role – his first on film – without ironising the dialogue or indulging in Partridgean mannerisms.13.Mindhorn(2016)In a sparkling cameo, Coogan dons tinted glasses and an ear stud as Pete Easterman, an arrogant TV actor who has had spin-off success as The Windjammer, while the career of one-time star Richard Thorncroft (Julian Barratt) has hit the skids. Receiving Thorncroft at his Isle of Man country club, Easterman spurns his proposal for a DVD release, reminding him, “You called me a stinking ham on Wogan, with the emotional range of a chair leg.”View image in fullscreenAs Pete Easterman in Mindhorn.Photograph: Netflix12.Northern Soul(2014)Alongside fellow northern luminaries Ricky Tomlinson, Lisa Stansfield and his old comedy partner John Thomson, Coogan lends his star power to this splendidly realised evocation of the Northern Soul dance movement in 1970s Lancashire. He plays the kind of teacher happy to write off his students as “mallet heads” and humiliate a boy by reading out the lyrics he has jotted down in a notebook (“Bloody hell, it’s a poem … that’s bobbins, that is”).11.Ruby Sparks(2012)Kicking off a superb run of films in 2012 and 2013, Coogan has a minor part in this clever fantasy about a writer (Paul Dano) who somehow brings a young woman (Zoe Kazan) into existence through his typewriter. Coogan joins an alpha supporting cast featuring Elliott Gould, Annette Bening and Antonio Banderas and impresses with his devilish turn as the sleazy, cynical author Langdon Tharp.10.Greed(2019)The muzzling of Michael Winterbottom: how Sony censored GreedRead moreCoogan plays the vulgar, bullying retail mogul Sir Richard McCreadie – all perma-tan and distractingly expensive teeth – in this heavy-handed but often hilarious satire. If only directorMichael Winterbottomhad stretched Coogan more and delved deeper into McCreadie’s curious relationships with his mother (Shirley Henderson) and ex-wife (Isla Fisher) rather than making predictable points about the iniquities of capitalism and the plight of garment workers and refugees.9.In the Loop(2009)In Armando Iannucci’s political satire, Coogan plays an irate constituent complaining to hapless minister Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) about a collapsing wall. The whiff of danger is essential to the character – at one point he roars, “I’m not going to let a bomb off, I work for the National Trust!”– but takes on a disturbing complexion today after the murders of MPs Jo Cox and David Amess.8.The Look of Love(2013)Coogan gives a nuanced, if oddly downbeat portrayal of Paul Raymond, the Soho strip club and porn tycoon who was once Britain’s richest man, in this entertaining but shallow film from Winterbottom that doesn’t quite make sense of Raymond’s multifaceted character: a highly driven, unconventional businessman, with a voracious appetite for sex, drink and drugs, who doted on his daughter (Imogen Poots) and was devastated by her death.The Look of Love: Steve Coogan and Michael Winterbottom on their biopic of Paul RaymondGuardian7.Stan & Ollie(2018)Coogan pays tribute to another comic son of the north-west, Stan Laurel, in this gentle portrait of Laurel and Oliver Hardy in the twilight of their careers. Coogan and co-star John C Reilly look the part and handle the physical comedy in various theatrical routines with a deft grace, but the film’s attempt to derive pathos from their fading legends falls a little flat.View image in fullscreenCoogan and John C Reilly in Stan & Ollie.Photograph: BBB Films/Allstar6.Coffee and Cigarettes(2003)In Jim Jarmusch’s anthology of vignettes, Coogan plays himself on screen for the first time and clearly relishes toying with assumptions about his personality and his ambitions to make it in Hollywood. Over the course of a deliciously poised 17-minute scene, he’s not afraid to come across as a libidinous, status-obsessed slimeball as he tries to brush off Alfred Molina’s screenplay proposal – and then comes to regret it.5.What Maisie Knew(2012)Coogan shines opposite Julianne Moore in this keenly observed modern-day adaptation of a Henry James novel about self-absorbed parents battling over their six-year-old daughter as their relationship falls apart. Deploying just the right kind of transatlantic accent, he plays oleaginous art dealer Beale, a man who whisks his daughter out of school early while on a work call and suggests going for “a double espresso”.4.A Cock and Bull Story(2005)In Michael Winterbottom’s suitably meta take on Laurence Sterne’s proto-postmodern work Tristram Shandy, Coogan plays himself working on a film of the novel, in which he is playing Shandy and the character’s father, Walter. We see him negotiating his way through an extramarital entanglement, dealing with an obnoxious tabloid reporter and sparring with co-star Rob Brydon. Their testy banter on this very funny film paved the way for their brilliant self-imitation games on four series of The Trip (also directed by Winterbottom and edited for the US into feature-length film versions).3.Philomena(2013)Steve Coogan and Martin Sixsmith on Philomena: ‘It’s got humanity without irony’GuardianWith an Oscar-nominated screenplay by Coogan and Jeff Pope, this powerful drama was a landmark in Coogan’s acting career. In the script and his performance as journalist Martin Sixsmith, he is at pains to restrain his natural instinct for comedy, allowing Judi Dench to get all the best lines as an Irish woman searching for the child she was forced to give up for adoption. The odd-couple dynamic between Coogan and Dench generates thoughtful reflections on morality and culpability, as Sixsmith’s indignation at the Catholic church is outflanked by Philomena’s pragmatic faith.2.Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa(2013)Steve Coogan on Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa: ‘He’s crass, but there’s a small amount of nobility’GuardianCan I just shock you? I like Alpha Papa. The only feature film in the sprawling Alanverse, it isn’t universally loved by fans and there is something a little odd about seeing Coogan’s most enduring creation given the big screen treatment, with a hostage taking plot contrived to provide the necessary 90-minute story arc. But if it’s judged harshly by some, it can only be because it doesn’t hit the matchless heights of Knowing Me Knowing You and I’m Alan Partridge. There is so much comedy gold and “radio gravy” here, from Alan singing along toRoachford’s Cuddly Toy over the opening creditsto the standoff on Cromer pier at the end.View image in fullscreenCoogan as Tony Wilson in 24 Hour Party People.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy1.24 Hour Party People(2002)After the fumble of The Parole Officer, Coogan got things back on track in Winterbottom’s free-wheeling, fourth-wall-busting love letter to Manchester and its music scene, brilliantly scripted by Frank Cottrell-Boyce. Coogan was perfectly cast as Mancunian Renaissance man Tony Wilson – Granada presenter, Factory Records boss, Haçienda owner and Madchester ringmaster – and brings just the right kind of maverick intellectual energy to the part. His scintillating performance at the head of a supremely talented cast holds the film together and injects a romantic nobility into this scabrous tale.Explore more on these topicsRankedSteve CooganPhilomenaIn the LoopMichael WinterbottomAlan PartridgeStan & OlliefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A community of people were finding their way back to how it was or something like it, she suggested.As for the incongruous view of people enjoying the sun and surf to the background of the rubble of Gaza, Rabinovitch added that this “was part of our life”. “It is complicated,” she repeated.Kiko Nadav, 70, shirt off, enjoying the sun from his deck chair at the water’s edge, said he had been hoping for this moment. “This beach is a family beach, a lot of time we make a barbecue, eat fish from the sea,” he said. “This is the best beach in Israel. We have been wishing a lot for this, and then we had the message from the municipality that it would reopen.”View image in fullscreenKiko Nadav was involved in fighting with Hamas gunmen during the 7 October attack.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianYakov Ohayon, 59, a former police officer who is now a lawyer, fought for five hours on 7 October after Hamas attacked his home in Zikim kibbutz. He left his three daughters in a secure room as he took up his weapon.Ohayon said he knew people who had died here. “My emotions are everywhere,” he added.Oren Weizman, 50, a civil engineer, had served in the Israeli Defense Forces and said he still struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder.One thing that made him feel better was surfing, and he had been coming here for that for nearly 30 years, he said.“I can breathe again,” he said of the beach’s opening. But he worried too. Could this really be the end of it? Could they move on from the last two years of horrors?“I got a lot of doubts about the [mental] health of them,” he said looking in the direction of Gaza. “After this war, they’re going to be devastated.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Strap in!Tom Hollander and Niamh Algar star in this fun, propulsive tale of a genius code-cracker, an oddball entrepreneur … and an evil supercomputer known as Charlie Big Potatoes trapped in a secret lair. Brace yourself for a wild rideLucy ManganThu 16 Oct 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 17.27 EDTShareThere’s in media res and then there’s the opening of The Iris Affair. The new caper-drama opens with a man being beaten half to death while a woman (Niamh Algar) looks on unmoved and refusing to hand over a MacGuffin to the man ordering the beating (Tom Hollander, channelling Michael Caine). They are watched by a rather more concerned teenager, Joy (Meréana Tomlinson), who becomes infinitely more concerned when Hollander-Caine’s character realises that jamming a gun into her neck might be a better way to elicit a response from MacGuffin lady. Then he realises he can’t quite bring himself to shoot the child. But he can order his heavy to do so. The hired gun swings around and we cut to Sardinia, Italy, the day before. And that, my friends, is how a prologue should be done. Properly tense, properly disorientating and long enough that you become properly engaged and almost forget that you know nothing about these people. Just don’t kill the kid!The next few episodes of this eight-part series keep the pedal to the metal but steers with perfect control around timelines (another begins in Florence two years before Sardinia), locations, revelations, multiple twists, double crosses, wigs, costume changes, false identities and set pieces, as a tale as entertaining as it is absurd takes thrillingly preposterous shape.View image in fullscreenCracking all the codes … Niamh Algar as Iris in The Iris Affair.Photograph: Sky UKAlgar, you see, is Iris Nixon (when she’s not going by one of those false identities, which includes Joy’s tutor, Miss Brooke), a supergenius and inveterate puzzle solver. She is approached in the wake of one of her greatest successes by an eccentric entrepreneur, Cameron Beck (Hollander), who “loves helping brilliant people do brilliant things”. He takes her into the bowels of his secret lair in Slovenia (“It’s really quite snazzy upstairs”) and shows her “a topological quantum device” that is using 2m qubits of processing power and “non-organic polymers” to create neural pathways and “think thoughts that have yet to be thought”. The machine is “the Before and After” and its name is Charlie Big Potatoes. “Well,” reasons Cameron. “It’s not small potatoes, is it?”You are either very, very in by this point or very, very out. I’m all in, because to write this sort of stuff takes guts, and to plot and pace it well, too, is a rare talent – and one I like to stretch out in front of and enjoy. Onward!All Iris has to do is break the code with which Charlie Big Potatoes’ inventor, Jensen Lind (Kristofer Hivju), has hidden the activation sequence that will bring CBP to life. It is somewhere in his closely written, annotated and equationed diary, and Jensen cannot help because he went bonkers some time ago, took an axe to his creation, and now sits mute and unmoving in a wheelchair. “Genius is madness on a good day,” says Cameron, looking at his erstwhile employee fondly. “Jensen ran out of good days.”Back in the present, it is clear that something in the intervening two years has rather kiboshed the promising partnership between Cameron and his new genius. He is now funding an international hunt to find her, via an online army of interested parties who congregate at the Two Seconds to Midnight website run by Alfie Bird (Sacha Dhawan), to keep track of the prize fund and pick up hints and tips. Frontrunners include some corrupt members of the Italian police’s Special Case Unit (I think the naming budget all went on Charlie Big Potatoes), who track down Iris’s lover (an Italian police officer she has already semi-framed and is blackmailing), then her address, but not – quite – Iris herself. The cat and mouse game that ensues brings back happy memories of Killing Eve, before that caper disappeared up its own fundament. Good times.Tech, terror and Tom Hollander: Niamh Algar on her wild new TV thrillerRead moreThe Iris Affair is a rollicking yarn fromNeil Cross, the creator ofLuther, stylishly and propulsively directed by Terry McDonough and Sarah O’Gorman. Cross’s script is drily witty while avoiding any hint of the cynicism that would spell death for the endeavour. You’ve got to go at this stuff with your whole heart or it doesn’t work at all. And in Niamh Algar, who specialises in women who have had just about enough of everyone’s nonsense – yes, yours, yours and especially yours, goddammit – they have the perfect actor in the role of Iris, who is herself mostly computer and only at her core still willing or capable of allowing human emotions to enter her calculations. I’m hoping it can sustain this wild a ride over its entire eight episodes, but I’m halfway and so far so good. Hurrah for Charlie Big Potatoes and all who search for the sequence to activate his non-organic polymer neural pathways! What fun we shall have!The Iris Affair aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTom HollanderreviewsShareReuse this content"

But is this just another way of delaying the inevitable?Morwenna FerrierThu 16 Oct 2025 12.09 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 12.10 EDTShareAfew months ago, I was invited to get a full-body scan in east London. Neko Health is one of several diagnostic clinics that, for a price, uses electrocardiograms, blood tests and a talking skin-scanner to examine you. The company claims it can detect various underlying cardiovascular and metabolic issues, assess your risk of developing pre-diabetes and identify suspect moles.From the outside, the centre looks like a vast glass mausoleum. Inside, it’s more of a curve-walled spa with pleasant changing areas, private examination rooms and pot plants. Sadly, there’s no swimming pool. The whole process takes less than an hour, and includes (among other things) a mostly nude scan, various blood draws, a test for grip strength and, at the end, through some swift data-crunching, a GP consultation. Most patients (me included) leave with a relatively clean bill of health but an eye on future issues. In its first year of operation, Neko says that 1% of its patients received potentially life-saving intel, which is not nothing. The idea is that this data can then be used to inform the NHS (or other healthcare providers), point people towards necessary treatment and, ultimately, extend life. Welcome to the age of preventive healthcare?Compared with some of the private clinics on the market, Neko, which was set up by Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek and has two outposts in London, is not wildly expensive – £299, as compared with the Kardashian-approved Prenuvo, which is coming to London, and costs almost £2,000. Although your money is useless unless you can find a way to skip Neko’s 100,000-person waiting list in the UK or in Sweden, where it’s from. Among those queue-jumpers have been some influencers (and less influential members of the press, like me). You may have seen them on social media, where playing God feels a lot more plausible ifyou’re wearing a butter-yellow dressing gownwhile bathed in the glow of a ring flash.View image in fullscreenProactive … Neko’s Spitalfields outpost.Photograph: Ståle Eriksen/Neko HealthMy Neko experience was perfectly pleasant. It doesn’t hurt. I enjoyed wafting through their pastel-walled rooms wearing their Nike sliders. And I also appreciated the unhurried experience, though that’s perhaps more of a reflection on the state of the NHS afteryears of underfunding. On the whole, 10 out 10 for the experience.The real question is whether it’s worth it, which is harder to parse. Partly because there is no control group, and because a glowing review from me would depend on whether it found anything – at which point I’d probably be less concerned with giving it five stars on Yelp. It’s also worth pointing out that it doesn’t perform X-rays, MRIs or CT scans, so can only detect blood abnormalities and skin cancers. People in my family tree have been riddled with tumours, and while I was reassured that none of my moles look untoward, all I can do now is live my life waiting for an unwanted growth – assuming I don’t drown ina flood first.The trouble with a two-tier system that begins with a private triage service is that the burden then lies with you, and the NHS, which is potentially left to do the difficult work of treatment. Prof Azeem Majeed, a GP and expert on primary care and public health at Imperial,told the Guardian last yearthat Neko’s scans were more technologically advanced, and included additional testing, compared with the NHS Health Check programme, which screens people aged between 40 and 74.Preventive beauty is rooted in the ambient terror that one day we will look as old as we actually are.However, Majeed said that “dealing with the rapid developments in private medical assessments will be challenging for the NHS and it is essential that these assessments add value to people’s health and do not create additional work – or anxiety for customers – without clear benefits”.Though I imagine some of Neko’s customers will have other private healthcare options tucked into their wallets.Early diagnosis is vital to treat serious diseases such as cancer, so the appeal of testing is obvious. But these scans tap into something deeper, an iteration of something you seeamong dictatorsand Silicon Valley types, that vainglorious cohort who honestly believe they can live for ever – or, in the case of Palantir founder and Trump ally, Peter Thiel,aren’t sure humanity should last at all.View image in fullscreenInto the future … Neko.Photograph: Ståle Eriksen/Ståle Eriksen/Neko HealthNeko did not invent our preoccupation with longevity, just as it’s not news that rich people live longer. Some of them even look younger, too. The beauty industry had been resisting the passage of time for centuries before I first slapped Nivea on to my face as a teenager. Prevention is just a new way of phrasing it, and paid-for preventive healthcare is a natural evolution of these preventive beauty products.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s about delaying it. It’s symptomatic of the lengths we’ll go to conform to impossible standards – another stick that women used to beat ourselves with, as if the responsibility is ours. The business of preventive beauty presents as almost sceptical of anti-ageing – particularly facelifts and tweakments, which seem undignified compared with a night cream. Yet both are rooted in the ambient terror that one day we will look as old as we actually are.I’ve tried a lot of these creams. I enjoy the process. And I dare say some of them make me glow. But they aren’t better than a good night’s sleep, good genes or generally being more chill. Even still, these are solutions to something out of your hands. However much you buy Susan Sontag’s reading that ageing is “a crisis of the imagination rather than of ‘real life’”, society – and the beauty industry – will still have you believe that you are old as soon as you are not young.On paper, Neko and its like are not about cheating death – that would be absurd. And the benefits of early intervention on your health is obviously a very different matter than early intervention on your wrinkles. But in the end – scans, creams, whatever – it is all a battle with nature, just tackled in slightly different ways. Having explored and exploited every inch of our planet, we are now trying to colonise ourselves, to overcome mortality.

Its creation as a marketable entity in the 1960s by the late Queen Elizabeth II was meant to “modernise” the monarchy for the 20th century. It worked, but only up to a point. Her son Prince Andrew has long been its biggest liability,this week in troubleyet again due to his alleged behaviour within that ghoulish circle, the friends of Jeffrey Epstein.King Charles now has a decision to make as to how far he can allow his brother’s past behaviour to tarnish the family’s image. That image is the essence of royalty.Monarchyhas no other authentication. The constitutional position of head of state in a democracy is subject to the will of parliament, but also to the “will” of the people. It was the latter will that forced the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936 over marrying a divorcee. A royal personage cannot stand for re-election. He or she is acceptable to the generality of public opinion or they are nothing.When in 1969 the late queen was persuaded, reluctantly, by her husband, Philip, and her press secretary, William Heseltine, to allow a film to be made called Royal Family, it was a constitutional decision. Elizabeth was not to retreat like other postwar European monarchs at the time into an anonymous obscurity, to stick to their bicycles. She would refresh Britain’s semi-divine concept of monarchy as embodied in an “ordinary family”. It was portrayed as “the Firm”, a term that originated with Elizabeth’s father, George VI.It worked. The family looked lovely as their young children picnicked by a Scottish loch. The film was watched and admired by millions. But there was a lurking risk. One day the same children would be different. They would be tormented teenagers, rampaging twentysomethings and matrimonial casualties. They might be offered grand palaces and safe jobs, “representing” the monarch the length and breadth of the land. But then what? Would they all behave? It was like writing a play when you have already cast the actors. The children became instant global celebrities.Elizabeth was lucky in Charles and Anne, who on the whole were impeccable. She then experienced upsets. One was her annus horribilis of 1992, when offspring Charles, Andrew and Anne all broke with their partners. Diana, Princess of Wales andSquidgygatewere broadcast round the world and Windsor Castle was ablaze. Every aide and butler could sell their memoirs. In a Gallup poll that year, only26%of the British public thought the monarchy should continue as it was.Another crisis came in 1997 with the death of Diana and its initially woeful mishandling by the late queen. Her personal approval rating sank toan all-time lowof 57%. Charles’s fell to 40%. Serious questions were raised of the future of the crown. At such times monarchy has nowhere to turn for sustenance but to public opinion. Its image is dependent on the media and the reaction to how it performs its rituals.The so-called cycling monarchies such as Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium did not go down the same path as the late queen. They became figureheads, anthropomorphic thrones, legacies of history and tradition, but they hold office strictly at the declaration of elected parliaments. Such monarchs practise none of Britain’s nonsense about religious anointment. They head up no “family firm”. Their relatives, close and distant, can go about their normal lives and do normal jobs. The king of the Netherlands stilloccasionally pilots a KLM jet. When in 1990 King Baudouin of Belgium refused to sign an abortion bill he was curtly told to abdicate for the day.Prince Andrew was already beingeased out of the limelightbefore the publication ofVirginiaGiuffre’s memoir. The next move is for the future king, William, to plan a refashioned monarchy. He has already indicated his intention to live not in London but in a modest house in Windsor Park. He will presumably hand his Westminster estate to the government, and its gardens to the public. That would be all to the good.But above all, William should release his children. He should do away with the royal family brand, disband the Firm andtake to his bicycle.

My pride was followed quickly by unease. How long had it been since I could say I was comfortable with myself?My daughter is almost four now and I’ve thought of my father-in-law’s words many times since that day. She’s at a precious age, no longer a toddler and still just on the precipice of childhood proper. She interacts with the world without self-consciousness and has not yet learned that society may expect something different from her.How does the government justify its backdown on super reforms? | Fiona KatauskasRead moreWhen she expresses hunger and when she eats, she does so with joyful abandon. When she takes a mouthful of something delicious we can see a whole-body response: she closes her eyes, tilts her head back and dances her shoulders up and down.I find these moments most affecting when they happen in social settings with celebratory food. I’ve watched her so completely zero in on potato-on-a-stick at a football game that not even a big strong purple Wiggle appearing would have broken her focus. I’ve watched her happily dance back to a party table for her third, fourth, fifth slice of fairy bread. She is completely unburdened by self-surveillance.Many girls will learn, if not explicitly taught then by cultural osmosis, the notion they shouldn’t be outwardly hungry. Whether a girl’s hunger is literally for food or it’s yearning for something greater in her life – a high-powered career, an unabashed artistic practice, a passionate affair – she is often taught to not be so honest in her expression of it.Watching my daughter’s strong sense of self has forced me to reflect on my own adolescence through the early 2000s, when our wildly misogynistic pop culture filtered down to the schoolyard. I once overheard a high-school boyfriend say I looked ugly when I ate. Instead of dumping him, I simply stopped eating when we were together.Later, in my 20s, when Instagram brought with it thefirst wave of diet culturemasquerading as “wellness”, I was primed to try it all: juice cleanses, appetite-suppressing teas, “quitting” sugar. I once lied to a colleague that I was eating soup for lunch when I had, in fact, poured green juice into a bowl.These memories are horrifying to me now and thank God for that. Thank God that in my daughter’s world there is no morality ascribed to food, there is nogoodorbad,or that most disgusting of office kitchen diet-speak,naughty. There is just desire and pleasure and satiety.It might be a little trite to say that adults can learn from watching children interact with the world, and any parent knows the humbling and primal understanding of their child’s innocence and vulnerability. More surprising to me has been the realisation that by parenting I can alsounlearn insidious lessons once taught to me and then internalised.Watching from Australia while Donald Trump targets my home of Chicago with armed troops prompts deep questions | Miles HerbertRead moreOne way I have started actively practising this unlearning is by imagining myself repeating any self-loathing inner monologue out loud to my daughter. Especially as while I may have mostly escaped diet culture’s clutches,beauty cultureis a little harder to outrun.Darling, mummy is tired because she’s spent [redacted] hours comparing her face to celebrities shilling beauty products. Imagine telling her how much screen time I’ve devoted to Googling cosmetic solutions instead of, say, going outside or making art or experiencing even a single sensory pleasure. Absurd!I am determined to model self-respect and self-love, to build for my daughter a strong defence against the world which one day soon will come crashing in. Living as I always deserved to in the first place will show her that she deserves it too. This should apply to all of parenting, really: the responsibility and privilege of it is immense.My daughter has recently entered a phase of pickiness around dinners. Frustrating as it may be, and I won’t pretend I exhibit the greatest patience in these moments – not even close – I’m comforted that even this developmental phase is about exercising a level of autonomy and power in her small world. It’s something I hope she will always feel empowered to do.One night recently I placed dinner in front of her and she told me with a frown, “you don’t make it yummy”. I can’t take offence, even for a second. I’m buoyed that she hasn’t learned to protect anyone else’s feelings first. She knows only what she likes, and she likes it yummy.Léa Antigny is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionSocial mediaFamilyHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Our ordeal has changed, but it’s far from overThu 16 Oct 2025 06.33 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 20.47 EDTShareThewar has ended, and it’s time for me to return to my coffee, my bread and my poetry. Yet I don’t know what it means to return to life, after death has lived within us down to the marrow. Death had us memorised by heart, reciting our names one by one with unwavering precision. We grew accustomed to it too, in all its forms and colours, until funerals became a daily ritual, much like a weather report we already know by heart. It rained death every day, and our homes scattered like dry leaves in an autumn wind.But another war has begun, of a different kind, more ruthless. The battles no longer take place only in the streets, but in every moment of life, in every step across the rubble, in every attempt to reclaim what remains of our daily spirit. The first chapter of this new war was the brutal anticipation of the roads leading to what remains of homes, or heaps of stones. With the destruction stretching as far as the eye can see, the roads guided us toward what is left of ourselves and our memory.Now, ifIsraelallows us to live, death will pour meaning into life. We must repair our dictionaries, reclaim our morning rituals, let the plates return to their tables and the road regain its usual calm on the way to school. And I must dust off my knees and ride the horse once more.Meanwhile, Salam, my uncle’s granddaughter, is discovering food for the very first time. She touches its colours and explores its flavours with her tiny senses. Having grown up on lentils alone, since the day she was born, she now finds fruit and vegetables available in Gaza’s markets with the ceasefire. When we handed her a banana, she didn’t know what to do with it and tried to eat it with the peel on. Then she tried an apple, and new words began slipping into her little food dictionary, as if each bite were opening a whole new world of life for her.In the Sabra neighbourhood where I live, neighbours are gradually returning, pitching tents on what were once homes. The streets are filled with tons of war remnants: unexploded hand grenades, or ones rigged to detonate if moved, half-burnt smoke bombs, explosives meant to demolish houses, mortar shells, aerial bombs and chemical residues left from partially burnt munitions.Dozens of children have been injured in the past two days from playing with or stumbling across these hazards. People return slowly, cautiously – but not everyone; the fear of Israel returning to the battlefield is present in every step. No one truly believes the annihilation has stopped, or that it has ended. The place is wrapped in denial and shock, as if memory can no longer hold all this pain. People need life, nothing more. Gaza, after all it has endured – pain, betrayal, neglect – deserves a real chance at living, a genuine one, not fragile ceasefires.In the same neighbourhood, armed groups that emerged during the war are multiplying. What is happening here is not the birth of a new order, but a vacuum filled with fear, opportunism and chaos. Local gangs are appearing in the shadows, armed and stripped of any moral restraint, and many believe they are not spontaneous forces, but tools exploited, or quietly tolerated, by Israel. This phenomenon does not aim only at control, but at dismantling Gaza’s social fabric after its buildings have been torn apart, leaving residents in a constant state of fear and uncertainty, where every step toward life feels fraught with danger.The annihilation may end, but the occupation continues as it did before 7 October 2023. The blockade remains, settlements expand and daily oppression persists. We return to our daily losses on the news, but in quieter, lower tones, as the poet and author Mahmoud Darwishsaid: “Our losses: from two martyrs up to eight, every single day, 10 wounded, 20 homes, 50 olive trees, in addition to the structural damage that will strike the poem, the play, and the unfinished painting.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now I wish I’d taken themThu 16 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 18.12 EDTShareMy mother was the most horrible cook, unbelievably bad at it. Her umbrella crime was the lack of self-knowledge – far from being bad, she thought she was brilliant – but underneath that, a set of discrete misapprehensions, any one of which would have been enough to make you not want to eat at her house. She’d never take a recipe literally; each ingredient could be swapped with something else of a similar colour, or a similar size, or not similar at all. She loved to throw in a rogue element. As I write this, I’m flicking through her magazine cuttings, and she’s made a note above an aubergine and potato casserole that says: “Good, but needs something else. Lime?”She thought everything, sweet and savoury, could be lifted by a dried apricot. She was extremely experimental but eschewed basic principles, such as parboiling, or meat being roasted for a specific amount of time, relative to its weight, rather than “for ever”. She loved cardamom.So when she died earlier this year, I figured many things would make me think of her, but none of the things would be edible. The only food-related thought I could conceivably have would be: “Thank God I never have to eat that almond soup again, which had an egg in it, but also an apricot.”I’d reckoned without her apple tree. There’s something wrong with it. It’s just a regular-looking tree, but it produces enough apples to power an army over a mountain. For three months of every year, I could never go and see her without her saying, “Please take some apples,” and handing me a crate too large to get in a car, and I would say, “No, nobody in my family likes apples and I don’t even like fruit,” and she’d go, “How about just these 37 apples at the top?”, and I’d go, “No.”Of course, this autumn, I’ve been possessed by the need to finish them all. I’ve made crumbles big enough for a football team, I’ve been leaving flapjacks on people’s doorsteps and hoping for the best, I’ve eaten vast amounts of things that are apple-adjacent (pork, oats). As the season draws to a close and the tyranny lifts, I can’t stress enough: eat your mother’s apples while she’s still alive. They’re quite tasty.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBereavementOpinionFruitFoodcommentShareReuse this content"

And even though it took just three minutes to cover less than a mile, that still felt like a bargain. Because, although I’ve been riding the shuttle train between Stourbridge Junction and Stourbridge Town all my life, only now have I realised how special it is, being the shortest railway line in Britain.I whiled away the three-minute journey reading deeply into the subject. There were a couple of operators on board, which seemed a bit excessive under the circumstances, so I took the opportunity to bombard them with questions. I felt bad about asking this, but I wondered whether, when they were growing up wanting to be train drivers, this was quite what they had in mind. “Well, the thing is,” said one of them, “I never really wanted to be a train driver in the first place.” I couldn’t think of anything to say to that.Otherwise they conveyed nothing but pride in their work, shuttling hundreds of thousands of passengers in and out of the town every year. They told me that as well as being the shortest line, it was also pretty steep, what with its 1-in-67 gradient. And, they said, they go back and forth no fewer than 214 times a day. “It is a bit repetitive,” one of them conceded.Later I read that the Germans are now laying claim to having the shortest railway line in all of Europe. It clocks in at barely half a mile and runs from Friedrichshafen Stadt to Friedrichshafen Hafen, and by the time you’ve said all that out loud the journey must be almost over.Fair play, but I award my home town a moral victory here. Because as far as I can see, the train between Friedrichshafen Stadt and Friedrichshafen Hafen only makes about 70 journeys a day. Small potatoes! Or kleine Kartoffeln, as they probably don’t say in Germany. Stourbridge’s 200-plus daily runs plainly knock Friedrichshafen’s efforts into a cocked hat.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRail travelThe Adrian Chiles columncommentShareReuse this content"

The words of peace following the Gaza ceasefire ring hollowThu 16 Oct 2025 09.04 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 12.33 EDTShareLast Monday, when the US president, Donald Trump, addressed the Knesset alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, my compatriot lawmaker Ayman Odeh and I raised a banner calling them to “Recognise Palestine”. We were brutallyexpelled by forcefrom the parliament’s plenum, revealing the fragile state of the supposed “only democracy in the Middle East”. How can Trump and Netanyahu speak of peace in the Middle East without recognition of the people deprived for decades of their basic liberties and rights under vicious occupation?Nowhere is the deceit more clear than in the occupied West Bank. There, the words of peace are but a weak and distant voice, but the horrifying sounds ofsettler violenceand terror still echo loudly. More than 30 occurrences of settler violence against Palestinians have beendocumentedsince the announcement of Trump’s 20-point plan at the end of September, including physical assaults, theft of agricultural produce and torching of vehicles and property.The rise of settler terrorism is not coincidental. This period marks the start of the harvest seasons. More than a vital economic event, it is an important social and national moment that exhibits endurance under occupation. Precisely for these reasons, year after year settlers target Palestiniansduring this precious time. During the 2024 harvest period, Yesh Din (an Israeli human rights group that collects and disseminates information regarding violations of Palestinians’ human rights in the West Bank)documented 113 separate incidentsof violence, harassment, harvest-thwarting or damage to olive trees and crops involving Israeli civilians and soldiers, which took place on lands belonging to 51 Palestinian villages, towns and communities.Yesh Din also found that “Israeli security forces appeared to have played a greater role in obstructing the olive harvest”. In about 70% of forceful prevention of access to lands, soldiers, border police officers and settlement civilian security coordinators (CSCs) were actually present. They either personally prevented Palestinians from accessing and harvesting in their own lands, or failed to stop settlers who harassed or assaulted them.This comes as no surprise, as the leader of the settlers’ political party,Bezalel Smotrich, was appointed as an additional minister in the Ministry of Defence in charge of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). In Umm al-Khair, for example, a special COGAT unituprooted private olive treesof Palestinians, citing lack of permits, but ignored violations of an illegal nearby settler outpost. Last week, the Jerusalem district court ruled to halt all building work in the outpost, which was built on lands seized by Israel and unlawfully transferred to settlers.In the occupied West Bank, settler terrorism is nothing but a tool by the government to pursue de-facto annexation. Earlier this month, Smotrichled a marchof thousands of settlers in support of annexation of the West Bank. He was quoted as saying, “We are continuing to take hold with our feet of the Land of Israel with many pioneers, many heroes, and hundreds of thousands of settlers who live in this part of the land … we need to normalise it and make it eternal.”The settlers and their supporters in the Knesset are clear on their motives and intentions. Why, then, do political leaders in the west refrain from meaningful sanctions and diplomatic measures? Smotrich wassanctioned by the UKin June, but the effect of the sanction has been minimal. He may not be able to travel to the UK and tour the West End, but he still enjoys the ministerial power to grab lands in the West Bank. Even in the announcement of sanctions, the UK highlighted they take place “in his personal capacity” solely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Starmer is serious aboutrecognition of Palestineas a state, how come it allows the Israeli government to violate its sovereignty with such violent means? Or was the recognition an empty ploy to shut down dissenting voices in the UK, a hollow act only to be realised in the rebranding of some maps?A just peace must respect the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people for self-recognition, sovereignty and liberty from military occupation and siege. Only when every human being’s dignity between the river and sea is respected can we truly say peace has been achieved.True peace requires an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel: this is the sole formula that enjoys consensus among the international community, the Palestinian national movement and the Israeli peace camp.Trump may have inflicted pressure on Netanyahu to halt the genocide, but he probably only did so because the burden of his relationship with the pariah regime of Netanyahu had become too great. The mass protests across the globe for the liberation ofPalestine, and the unwavering anti-government demonstrations inside Israel, are the real forces behind this pressure.It is thanks to this enormous civil movement that a ceasefire has been signed, the hostages released and the people of Gaza can enjoy safeguard from annihilation. After the ceasefire agreement has been signed, it is vital to keep applying this pressure.

At oral arguments in Louisiana v Callais on Wednesday, theUS supreme courtappeared ready to strike down section 2, effectively completing the gradual nullification of the Voting Rights Act that it has pursued for over a decade.The case stems from new congressional districting maps that were drawn inLouisianaafter the 2020 census, which found both that the state was eligible for six seats in theHouse of Representativesand that its population was about one-third Black. The state initially drew maps that featured only one majority-Black congressional district, rejecting seven more racially fair maps; voters sued, and federal courts ordered Louisiana to comply with the Voting Rights Act by drawing new maps in which Black voters would be a majority in a second district, thereby reflecting their share of the population and giving Black Louisianans an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their choice.But now, a group of people identifying themselves as “non-African-American voters” have sued to get those racially proportionate maps thrown out, arguing that enforcement of the VRA violates their own rights under the 14th and 15th amendments. They claim the maps drawn to remedy racial discrimination against Black people in fact constitute racial discrimination against non-Black (read: white) people. The court seems likely to side with them.If they do, it will mark the end of the Voting Rights Act, widely considered the crowning achievement of thecivil right movement, which the supreme court, under John Roberts, has been dismantling for years. In 2013’s Shelby county v Holder, the court struck down much of section 5, which had required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to get federal preclearance for changes to its voting laws.In subsequent cases, the court has repeatedly narrowed the conditions under which litigants can bring voting rights claims and expanded states’ leeway to make voting laws that would have previously been deemed discriminatory. Writing for the majority in Shelby, Chief Justice Roberts claimed that racial animus and inequality had diminished enough that such a regime was not necessary, and indeed violated the rights of states. As states imposed a slew of new voting restrictions in the aftermath, the gap between Black and white voter participation ratesgrew dramatically. It expanded twice as much in districts that had previously been subjected to the section 5 preclearance regime.On Wednesday, the court seemed determined to apply the same logic that it used in Shelby county to section 2, demanding that Janai Nelson, the head of the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, justify why section 2 should still be efficacious and should not be considered to have somehow expired. Justices Kavanaugh and Alito asserted that the racial gerrymander was justified if it was intended as a partisan gerrymander – that is, that the lawmakers’ stated or professed intentions was what mattered, and not the racially discriminatory impact of the gerrymander.Previous supreme court precedent, as well as ample evidence from the congressional record, has said that discriminatory impact, rather than intent, is sufficient to constitute illegal racial discrimination – but at oral argument, the Republicans on the court, along with those representing the litigants, did not seem to think that this should matter. As she rebutted these arguments in the guise of asking questions from the bench, one could hear the exhaustion in Ketanji Brown Jackson’s voice. The remedies, she sputtered, “are so tied up with race, because race is the initial problem!” Jackson has been the court’s most passionate and articulate advocate for the Reconstruction amendments and for the legacy of the civil rights movement, but she seemed to know that her colleagues were not listening to her.The case reflects two major trends of the Roberts court: hostility to racial justice claims brought by minorities, and a willingness to invert civil rights law and the Reconstruction amendments alike to create interpretations in which these legal traditions function to entrench, rather than challenge, historical hierarchies of race and gender. Louisiana’s attorney general – who has switched sides in the case since it was initially argued last year, joining an opposition to the Voting Rights Act – claimed that to assume that Black voters would vote differently than white voters – which inLouisiana, they overwhelmingly do – would be to unconstitutionally impose a racial stereotype. This facile fiction elicited exasperation from Justice Kagan.But the attorney general knew his audience. Roberts has long been an enemy of practices that attempt to remedy historical and ongoing racial discrimination, claiming that the law mandates that state and private actors alike take no interest in such projects and attempt facially race-blind policies in everything from voting rights enforcement to college admissions – no matter how racially discriminatory against Black Americans such practices prove to be in reality. “The way to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” he oncememorably said, “is to stop discriminating on the basis of race” – that is, to stop trying to account for or combat racism with official policy. The result will be that if the court rules in Louisiana’s favor, it will no longer be illegal, in practice, to racially gerrymander congressional districts to minimize and dilute Black voter power. But it will be illegal to use race to redistrict in such a way that restores Black voter power.It is apparently through this fanciful and motivated reasoning that Roberts and his colleagues have decided that any move to secure Black Americans’ voting rights and equality in fact violates the very constitutional amendments that were meant to secure their voting rights and equality. The Voting Rights Act does not violate the 15th amendment; it enforces it, and gave the United States, during the 60 years or so of its enactment, its only plausible claim to being a real democracy. To say that the VRA contradicts the 15th amendment is more than just bad reasoning. It is bad faith. But bad faith, increasingly, is what the supreme court operates under.If the supreme court rules in favor of the “non-African-American” voters and vacates what is left of the Voting Rights Act, as they are expected to, then a decision will probably come down sometime in June, just a few months before the November 2026 midterms. The resulting racial gerrymanders are expected to net Republicans19 House seats.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOpinionRaceUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsLouisianacommentShareReuse this content"

The failure of governance runs deeperThu 16 Oct 2025 13.48 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 20.49 EDTShareTheChina spying rowhas revealed disturbing weaknesses in the processes of the UK state. It cannot be in the national interest for a case involving national security to get so close to the courts and then for it to be abandoned in what remain mysterious circumstances. Public confidence, as well as security itself, are inevitably placed at risk. But this genuinely important issue now risks being blanketed by the fog of the party-political battle at Westminster.For the third time this week, MPs spent Thursday trading accusations about whether the Conservatives or Labour are more to blame for the fiasco of last month’s collapsed prosecution. To be fair,the latest exchangesdid not descend to the abject “did-didn’t” level that was reached at prime minister’s questionson Wednesday. Politicians from Sir Keir Starmer down are fond of saying that the national interest comes before the party interest. But there has been too little evidence of that principle in the current dispute.The main issue is not, in fact,whether Chinais a security threat to the UK. That is a no-brainer. Many countries, including Britain, spy on their foes – and perhaps on some of their friends too. But the threat posed by China reflects its size, wealth and values. Delivering his annual threatupdateon Thursday, the head of MI5,Sir Ken McCallum, said that he encountered that threat on a daily basis. “Do Chinese state actors present a UK national security threat?” he asked. “The answer is, of course, yes.”What is in doubt is whether the processes of the British state are as well honed as they should be to cope with such cases in modern circumstances. The collapse of an alleged spying case involving one of the three countries identified by Sir Ken as the chief threats to the UK – Iran and Russia are the others – provides its own answer. Very obviously, this was a case of state failure.The governance problem is on two levels. The first is that the law has not kept pace. The two defendants (who denied any wrongoing) were charged and faced trial under the Official Secrets Act 1911, which was still in force when they were first arrested. Yet the security world of 2025 is radically different from that of 1911. Hence the changes brought in by theNational Security Actin 2023. Hence, also, the pressure at a late stage to strengthen the witness statements by civil servants that werepublishedthis week. But the law should, and could, have been reformed years ago.The second problem is with decisions to prosecute in national security cases. This necessarily involves a sensitive balance between the government, as the primary custodian of the national interest, and the independentCrown Prosecution Service, headed by the director of public prosecutions. Ministers insist that, like the head of MI5, they wanted the China trial to go ahead. But the collapse of the case suggests that this government and these law officers have got that balance wrong. That must change.Fairly or unfairly, the China case collapse damages trust. It makes Sir Keir’s government look hesitant where national security is concerned. Labour’s struggle to get its story straight has not helped. This even has distant echoes of the very first Labour government, which fell after Ramsay Macdonald’s decision not to proceed with theCampbellincitement to mutiny case in 1924. Labour now has a big majority, while Mr Macdonald had none at all, but Sir Keir should not underestimate the stakes.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Democrats and others are right to warn against illegal and unauthorised use of forceThu 16 Oct 2025 13.49 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe drumbeat is growing louder. Covert operations are supposed to remain just that, but on Wednesday Donald Trump confirmed that hehad approved secret CIA actionsin Venezuela and suggested that he was considering strikes on its territory. These comments follow the administration’s extrajudicial killings at sea: attacks on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean that have left at least 27 dead – a frightening new precedentdenounced by UN experts as illegal. The US has already built up forces in the region, with about 6,500 troops now stationed there. “No to war in the Caribbean … No to regime change … No to coups d’état orchestrated by the CIA,” railed Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s dictator, after Mr Trump’s remarks.The US president’srepeated claimthat each boat strike saves 25,000 American lives is even more preposterous than it first sounds. The fentanyl that killed 48,000 people in the US last year did not come from Venezuela; most of it is from Mexico. But Mr Maduro’s regime looksincreasingly isolated. The US has designated Venezuela’sTren de Araguagang as a terrorist organisation that has “invaded” the US, claiming that Mr Maduro ispersonally responsible. It has used that posturing to justify deportations and toboast– against the evidence – that Mr Trump has cut violent crime in cities.This administration has proved unexpectedly active in Latin America, apparently the one sphere of foreign policy where the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is making the running. He has long sought to oust Mr Maduro for both ideological and material reasons. Other hawkish figures in the administration, such as Stephen Miller, share this view. Mr Trump initially licensedanother, simultaneous approach; his envoy Richard Grenell brokered agreements on deportation flights and energy contracts. Many believe that the hawks have prevailed, with reports that Mr Trump ordered Mr Grenellto end talks.That CIA operations and war planning are being aired so enthusiastically may suggest that the US hopesregime changewill come through Mr Maduro fleeing (unlikely), or that it still cherishes the long-held (and so far unevidenced) wish that military and security forces will turn on him. Others suspect that this is the latest example of Mr Trump’s blunt “or else” approach to foreign policy – designed to extract more from Mr Maduro.The US has a long and inglorious history of intervention in Latin America. But Mr Trump will be wary of angering Maga supporters with military action and of looking like a paper tiger if Mr Maduro endures again. The attempt to remove him in Mr Trump’s first term, with the US backing the then opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, proved a fiasco. Last week’s decision to award the Nobel peace prize toMaría Corina Machado– whose opposition movement is widely believed to have won last year’s elections, promptingstill more brutal repressionby the regime – is a symbolic boost for those standing against Mr Maduro, but is highlyunlikelyto be a turning point in itself. And if insiders depose him, Madurismo without Maduro might not be an improvement for Venezuelans.The Trump administration may convince itself that military action can be strictly delimited, given Mr Maduro’s restricted options. But Democrats andhuman rights groupsare right to warn it against illegal and unauthorised uses of force, endangering the lives of Venezuelans, increasing the insecurity they face, and risking escalation.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But insurer warnings over the ability to cover people’s homes in flood-prone areas should jolt the government from its conflicted policy stance in this field (Towns may have to be abandoned due to floods with millions more homes in Great Britain at risk, 14 October)Investment of £10.5bn over the next 10 years is technically “a record”, but less of an increase than the Environment Agency’s updated assessment ofnational flood riskearlier this year. And compared with the more than £100bn being spent by water companies over just five years to clean up sewage and build reservoirs, it’s a comparative drop in the (rising) ocean.The government must enable landscape-scale reforestation of upper catchments to hold back water. But its land-use framework, which could identify suitable land less vital for food production, is still to break cover, and its sustainable farming incentive subsidy, which could encourage water management activities, is on pause.We should be adopting “sponge city” approaches to water storage and drainage, pioneered in China and increasingly adopted across the world. But the government appears to now regard a mandatory requirement to do so as another one of the blockers to its housing ambitions. Recent proclamations by the environment secretary, Steve Reed, to “build, baby, build” may speak to one national crisis. But he should “sponge, baby, sponge” too.With thewater regulation shake-upto be confirmed in the autumn, there are opportunities to ensure that the growth agenda is climate-resilient and nature-restorative. The blocks to this appear to be thechancellorand the housing department, both of whom should care about housing insurability.Alastair ChisholmDirector of policy,Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental ManagementFlood risk is one of the fastest-growing threats to our built environment (Editorial, 14 October), but not enough attention is being paid to the misalignment of flood-risk mitigation and housebuilding ambitions. The government rightly hopes to build 1.5m homes this parliament, while simultaneously hoping to introduce swathes of flood-mitigation measures. These will come into conflict – and already are with the “sequential test”, whereby development needs to be located in the lowest-risk viable land. This has come under fire from developers, who see it as a hindrance to housebuilding as many local authorities have routinely failed to provide data ahead of planning applications, only to then refuse the application at the decision stage.The answer is to align policies on housebuilding and flood mitigation. This cannot simply mean putting pressure on developers to follow rules that will not function in practice. Or putting an onus on local authorities to provide local plans with detailed provisions on land supply to keep development in line with flood-risk ambitions, as this presumes a council-level capacity that simply is not there.Instead, the government must think about how to help local authorities source flood-risk data to speed up information-gathering for planning decisions, and how low- or medium-risk sites can be mitigated by developers to allow for building without compromising our obligations towards people who want to own a home without fear of it flooding.Laurie WilcocksonPolicy Liaison Group for Housing Delivery & GrowthHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Perhaps this last is what makes the humanities so threatening in certain quarters.Leon CraigBerlin, GermanyI was reminded while reading Francesca Simon’s opinion piece of the old graffito regarding the social sciences: “Sociology degrees. Please take one” (scrawled above a toilet-roll holder).The social sciences cover a broad span. They include, and inform, our understanding of health, housing, education, taxation and more. Some graduates end up in such worthwhile endeavours as advertising or political polling. Others in such misunderstood endeavours as the civil service and local government.Badenoch’s campaign against “rip-off degrees” does two things. First, it fails to understand that the economy actually benefits from people studying travel and tourism, event planning, drama and golf course management. Second, it works against individual desires to study for study’s sake – a stance inimical to a party that espouses individualism.Polly LlwynfedwenBrecon, PowysFrancesca Simon is right to challenge the narrow-minded focus on degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem)subjects proposed by Kemi Bademoch. As a newly arrived undergraduate in 1976, I asked the Zimbabwean (but at that point still Rhodesian) student in the next-door room what he was studying, expecting him to say physics or engineering, or something else technical that he could use to help build his country’s future. Instead he replied, “Philosophy.” Why, I asked, not a practical subject? He replied, “Because you need people who can think clearly to stop people like Idi Amin taking over.” He was right, of course, though sadly Robert Mugabe still inflicted terrible damage on Zimbabwe.Now, more than ever, critical thinking skills and the perspective of history are needed to understand the multiple challenges and tragedies of our world.Rev Tim EvansLancasterDr Jan Udris and his lessons on basic political concepts (Letters, 14 October) have much in common with the “rip-off” degrees belittled by the leader of the Conservative party. They all aim to teach students to read critically, to discuss, to evaluate and, ultimately, to call out bullshit. Which is why those on the right find them so dangerous.Eleanor JardineHertfordHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Performers and organisers would run the very real risk of imprisonment by the authorities. Now those same authorities are paying comedians to come over.I’m of the view that allowing comedians now, after banning them before, is progress. I could also make a robust argument that opposing this festival is unsupportive of progress. However, nuance is the hallmark of a mature approach to discourse, and while the festival could easily be seen as cosmetic, it was also a huge development.Any kind of opening up is welcome and needs supporting. To deny Saudi audiences this chance is ill-informed and cloaked in the language of self-righteousness and indignation.For further exploration of this endlessly complex subject, I would recommend a22-minute response on YouTubeby Trevor Noah, the South African comedian and former host of The Daily Show on US TV.Omid DjaliliComedian and actorHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Murphy has already spoken for an hour, in raw and moving detail, about the guilt he will feel when he has to walk down a guard of honour to mark his fifth champion jockeys’ title at Ascot on Saturday, his dailystruggle with alcoholism, his near catastrophic return to drinking this summer, the dangers of racing and the Sylvia Plath poem he loves most.But the milestone of his 30th birthday troubles him. “It was incredibly significant because I never thought I’d get to 30,” Murphy says, as he uses a smouldering cigarillo to light another in an unbroken chain stretching across this corner of Lambourn.They call it the Valley of the Racehorse and, on a Monday morning, mist hangs over the village – in the same way that Murphy is enveloped in a cloud of smoke. “I never had any plans past 30,” he says amid a fresh puff.Did he think he would die before then? “It wasn’t quite that morbid but all the time you have targets: ‘I want to win this race, I want to win this championship, I want my own house.’ I never made any targets past 30.“That’s another thing getting to 30. Lots of people are in serious relationships and beginning to have children. Maybe I’m selfish. I was in a very serious relationship with a beautiful girl and a lovely person, Elizabeth Nielsen. That ended at the beginning of this year, but we’re still very good friends. We still speak almost every day. Most of my ex-girlfriends I’ve remained friendly with, which is great. I never feel like the reason those relationships ceased was because of them. It was because of me.” Is he close to finding new targets for himself? “It’s very different now. Every day I have to work at being sober and it’s going well. But I’ve had good periods in the past … ”In late April he was driving at night when, with a passenger alongside him, hecrashed into a tree. Murphy was fortunate that no one was hurt because, hours after the accident, he was “just shy” of having twice the legal limit for alcohol in his system. When the case went to court in July, he was fined £70,000 and banned from driving for 20 months.View image in fullscreenMurphy at his home in Berkshire: ‘Every day I have to work at being sober and it’s going well. But I’ve had good periods in the past.’Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThese were the latest in a litany of punishments. Murphy’s longest suspension occurred in December 2021 when he wasbanned for 14 monthsby the British Horseracing Authority after he admitted various disciplinary offences, including misleading BHA officials, breaches of Covid-19 protocols and two failed breath tests.“During those 14 months I didn’t find it difficult to remain sober. I got some confidence thinking: ‘This is easy.’ What I failed to remember was I had no stress in my life. I wasn’t putting pressure on myself to ride winners. But that’s false confidence, because someone with a drink problem has to work at it every single day and that’s where I failed.“I tried numerous times to drink like a nice fellow, probably like you, a fellow that can have one, two and, on a crazy night, three glasses of wine or four pints of beer. Some days I was capable of doing it. But the days that I’m not capable? Dangerous is the correct word. Even with all the effort I was putting in I had to surrender [this year], I’m afraid.”Did he feel before his accident in April that he was sliding back into darkness? “No, I thought I was doing very well. I thought I had some controlled drinking evenings but I lied to myself. I did the same thing I’d done previous times and lost control. I didn’t need to drink-drive that evening. It was just awful. But I’m very lucky there weren’t more severe consequences because people don’t often get a second chance.”View image in fullscreenMurphy lights up a cigarillo at home.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianNow, as he counts each new day of being sober, Murphy is mortified by his actions that night. His new book, Sacrifice, is anunsparing account of the all-consuming demandsjockeys face and he admits that drink can be a refuge from gruelling travel, the constant need to “waste” and make weight and the perennial hazards of riding a racehorse at 40mph.Most of all, as he writes in his diary of last year’s championship victory, Murphy is tormented by a voracious need to win. Yet even generational jockeys lose more than three-quarters of their races. “It takes its toll if you try and escape and hide from it, because that’s when I was most susceptible to drinking to black out.”He now reminds himself, as soon as he wakes, about the importance of not drinking today. “In 2024 I prayed to be sober every day, and then I forgot. I still prayed that my family are healthy every single morning and night but it shows that, when someone really wants to drink, being sober is no longer on the priority list.”That quest is now paramount and Murphy attends weekly Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings in different cities, wherever he is racing, and he stresses: “I’ve never had a problem saying: ‘I’m an alcoholic.’“I listened to a man the other day. He was Irish and we were in London and he said: ‘Life is still shit. It’s not any better now that I’m sober. Actually it can feel worse – because I can’t run away from the shit parts. But one thing is clear to me. If I pick up a drink, it won’t be any fucking better.’ That stuck with me.”His father and grandfather both lived for decades with alcoholism. Does he believe the disease has genetic roots? “I don’t know. Both of them never drank during my lifetime. My dad really was a wonderful father. He never told us not to drink but he used to tell us about the pitfalls on the way to mass. He never shoved it down our throats and my father’s been 35 years sober.”Can he speak to him about his drinking problems? “I can. I tell him sometimes if I had a good [AA] meeting. About seven years ago he left this book on a table for me. It might have been the big [AA self-help] book. That was a hint.”View image in fullscreenOisin Murphy: ‘There are a couple of hours where I feel I can walk on water. But it leaves and you don’t know when it’s going to return.’Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianMurphy laughs quietly and then says: “Counselling and therapy is great – if you’re completely honest. But if you hide anything, it’s a waste of time, not just for you but for the person trying to listen. That year I was off racing I thought therapy was the best thing in the world and my therapist was a female god. But I decided I could try and drink like a gentleman again.”Does he still see the same therapist? “I stopped seeing her in February and now I have a few. One man is Irish, and he’s dealt with Irish jockeys in the past. At Sporting Chance, I speak to a former alcoholic and heroin addict who has been clean and sober for 20-odd years. Those two fellows are very good. And there’s another female doctor who is also excellent. Do you know what I love about them? It’s often not scheduled. They’ll just ring up or WhatsApp message me for a chat. The problem with scheduled therapy is that you can almost plan what you want to say.”He shakes his head. “Everyone’s looking for a reason for Oisin Murphy’s drinking. Something terrible must have happened as a child. But it didn’t. I had a wonderful childhood. And hence I didn’t have a drink problem at 20. But the bottom line is I found escapism but also an awful lot of trouble in the bottle.”Murphy still has highs in the saddle: “The odd day where I feel like I did in Doncaster when I had that four-timer or round Salisbury a few weeks ago where I had another four-timer. There are a couple of hours where I feel I can do anything, that I can trust my instinct and walk on water. But it leaves and you don’t know when it’s going to return.”In his book Murphy insists he was so drained bywinning the 2024 jockey titlethat he would never chase the championship again. Yet here we are, a year on, and Murphy will be crowned once more as the leading jockey. “I doubt myself a lot,” he says and he will try to avoid eye contact with the other jockeys as they form two lines to applaud his achievement. Murphy feels almost guilty.“Maybe it’s the realisation that a lot of the guys are as good, and talented, as me. They just don’t have the number or the quality of horses to ride. Maybe they aren’t as lucky in being able to communicate as well, but I don’t think there’s much separating us.”Jockeys risk serious injury, paralysis, even death and, as Murphy points out, most of his colleagues in the weighing room are doing “the exact same hours” as him, hacking up and down the motorways, riding seven days a week without the plaudits or the money he earns.View image in fullscreenMurphy after winning the Nunthorpe Stakes on Asfoora at York in August.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAMurphy loves riding great horses and he is obsessed with winning, but his hinterland extends beyond racing. He talks about the crisis in Afghanistan and devastation in Gaza. “As I’ve got older, I’ve realised I don’t want to get too wrapped up in horse racing. I need to educate myself on other matters because I don’t want to be one of those fellows that’s still riding and he isn’t very good any more – and there’s nothing else to discuss.”He is “really interested in insurance” and the poetry of Plath. Murphy recently bought a new anthology of the American’s poems. “You have to go quite deep to understand what she’s saying. She lived in a time where there was also a stigma around having a mental health problem. But there’s much of her work I never get depressed by even though I comprehend how she’s leaving [the world].”He answers decisively when I ask him for his favourite Plath poem: “Poppies in July. You feel the want and lust for escape.” It’s a short and painful poem. Yet Murphy stresses that, unlike Plath, he doesn’t experience depression. “Being busy helps because I have to go out early every morning, I’ve got things to do.”His searing focus is exhausting, but more manageable now. “I remember the2019 championship season, when I was so tired and the pressure went up. But I was lacking sleep because I’d been drinking heavily. Now, on the whole, I’ve been sleeping well. I don’t feel exhausted. My lifestyle has never been better managed. It’s still hectic but it’s not chaotic.”As he gently waves away the pall of smoke around him, Murphy nods with the hard-won knowledge that now frames his life as a champion jockey and an intelligent yet vulnerable man. “It will remain absent of chaos provided I stay sober.”In the UK,Action on Addictionis available on 0300 330 0659.Explore more on these topicsHorse racinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

Reports suggest Sean Dyche is waiting to take over, but history shows Evangelos Marinakis sways like the wind, and victory against Chelsea could be enough to save Postecoglou’s job for now. Goals have been a mounting concern for a team that have been beaten in four of their last five league matches and failed to score in any of those defeats. Failure to find their shooting boots will ensure Forest go three consecutive top-flight games without a goal for the first time since 1999. It will be a tough task against a buoyant Chelsea team, who entered the international break having beaten Liverpool. Moisés Caicedo was instrumental in the win against the defending champions, scoring the opener, and the 23-year-old leads the league in tackles (28) and interceptions (18). Elliot Anderson, whose total of 55 turnovers is also a league-high tally, will have his work cut out for him in what may be his toughest midfield battle of the season.Yara El-ShabouryNottingham Forest vChelsea, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)2Brighton face fight to make Europe againTony Bloom knows that standing still is not an option in thePremier League. The Brighton owner has established his boyhood club as top-flight regulars since their promotion in 2017 thanks to a shrewd recruitment process that is the envy of most of their contemporaries. Bloom acknowledged this week that his aim of qualifying for Europe again has become much harder as Fabian Hürzeler’s side prepare to face Newcastle, who have an identical record after seven matches, at the Amex on Saturday. “Everything about the Premier League every year becomes more difficult,” said Bloom. “Hence we have to always look to improve and innovate because if you stand still, our competitors are fiercely competitive. They are looking to overtake one another and get stronger all the time. We have to do likewise and ideally we are going ahead even faster than the other teams.”Ed AaronsBrighton v Newcastle, Saturday 3pm3Burnley need to shore up fortificationsThis match between two promoted sides could be a defining early-season moment, with Burnley eager to fortify Turf Moor in their push for survival. Scott Parker’s side have shown flashes of quality and their unique home needs to be a solid foundation. So far, they have taken four points from three games at Turf Moor – including a crucial win against Sunderland – while conceding just two goals. In contrast, four of their five defeats and 80% of the goals they have shipped have come on the road. Meanwhile, Leeds have generated significant optimism under Daniel Farke, securing eight points from seven games. Their promising start could have been even better had it not been for small margins. Gabriel Gudmundsson’s own goal at Fulham and the poor defending that allowedBournemoutha stoppage-time equaliser left crucial points on the table. The trip to Burnley, where they will be hoping for consecutive Premier League away wins for the first time since 2022, is another high-stakes test.YE-SBurnley v Leeds, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenScott Parker (left) and Kyle Walker will be looking for a potentially crucial win against Leeds.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters4Glasner takes plaudits despite Everton lossCrystal Palace may havelost their unbeaten record to their bogey side Evertonbut Oliver Glasner kept on winning during the international break. As well as picking up the Premier League’s manager of the month award for September – the first Palace manager to win it since Tony Pulis in 2014 – he was named Austria’s coach of the year title at the 2025 Niki awards in Vienna before attending a special Westminster reception at the Speaker’s House on Wednesday evening that celebrated their FA Cup and Community Shield triumphs, as well as the work of the Palace for Life Foundation. It’s back to business against Bournemouth on Saturday and Glasner will be hoping that the defender Chris Richards, one of six members of Palace’s squad to have played every minute of the league campaign, will have recovered after featuring in the USA’s friendly win over Australia in Colorado on Wednesday.EACrystal Palace v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm5Fragile Rodri remains vital to CityThirteen months after suffering a near-season ending knee injury against Arsenal, Rodri’s medical problems remain a concern for the player and Pep Guardiola. The midfielder is vital to Manchester City’s cause. After coming off 22 minutes intothe 1-0 win at Brentfordwith a sore hamstring (and withdrawing from Spain’s international commitments in the break), will the 29-year-old be available for Everton’s visit? If he is, it may be unrealistic to expect him to complete the 90 minutes, something the Spaniard has done just twice this season. Questions remain over Rodri’s robustness in the long term.Jamie JacksonQuick GuidePickford aiming to 'build legacy' after extending Everton stayShowThe Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford intends to \"build a legacy\" after signing a new contract at the club.The England No 1 will take his stay to 12 years after extending his existing deal to 2029. \"I'm delighted to get it done – it's an extra two years, so four years in total,\" he said. \"It just shows the commitment I've made to Everton and also the faith the club has put into me as well.\"I'm over the moon and it gives me the opportunity to build a legacy for myself here, move forward and build this club to where we want to be.

Shad Forsythe eventually left his role as head of first-team performance at the Emirates to perform the same job for Borussia Dortmund and it was regarded as quite a coup whenSunderlandsecured the American’s services late this summer. As their French striker Wilson Isidor told L’Équipe: “The intensity in training is crazy now, we’re doing a lot more physical work.” Le Bris’s team have certainly made a robust start to the season, collecting 11 points from seven games, but they could still do with a home win against a Wolves side who are bottom, especially with tricky-looking fixtures at Chelsea and at home to Everton and Arsenal on the horizon.Louise Taylorskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are in pole position after Liverpool’s wobble but must be ruthless with their advantage. A trip to Fulham on Saturday evening will test them;a draw in this fixture last seasonwas the kind of result that left Mikel Arteta’s side unable to keep up with Liverpool. Champions have to be single-minded in these games. There will be some weary limbs after the international break. Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka have played twice for England, Martin Ødegaardis out for six weekswith a knee injury and Arteta has to think about hosting Atlético Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday. But there can be no excuses. Arsenal could be four points clear of Liverpool once the weekend is over.Jacob SteinbergFulham vArsenal, Saturday 5.30pm8Draw unlikely for injury-hit Spurs and VillaExpect goals atTottenham HotspurStadium on Sunday. None of the last 20 league meetings between Spurs and Aston Villa have ended level, a streak that stretches back to a 1-1 draw in 2012. Back in the present, Spurs sit third in the league after a seven-match unbeaten streak in all competitions but, yet again, Thomas Frank must contend with an extensive injury list. Yves Bissouma is the latest addition, having sustained an ankle injury on international duty with Mali. Aston Villa have historically troubled Spurs, winning four of their last six league meetings. Unai Emery’s men will rely on their threat from dead balls – 25% of their shots having come from corners – and the playmaking prowess of Morgan Rogers. The midfielder’s nine assists in 2025 lead the league and his consistency has seen him join an exclusive list: the former captains Gareth Barry and Gareth Southgate are the only other Villa players to feature in 10 or more consecutive England matches. It is a remarkable feat for Villa and a clear sign of their resurgence at the top level despite their wobbly start to the season.YE-STottenham vAston Villa, Sunday 2pm9United putting the onus on LiverpoolArne Slot may be more preoccupied with Ruben Amorim’s approach than Liverpool’s much-debated system as the Dutchman plots a way out of a rare losing streak. Manchester United’s2-2 draw at Anfield in January, another false dawn as it turned out, was built on an improved and impressive mentality,according to Amorim. Slot was less complimentary, claiming a combination of United’s low block and long-ball tactics were responsible for frustrating Liverpool that day. “In the last 15 minutes you could see, if they play over the ground, how good they are,” was one of his many barbed comments. United played 61 long passes in the corresponding fixture last season, 15.9% of their overall total of 383, while Liverpool played 47, 10.7% of their 438 total. Slot has raised the subject of United’s tactics several times since, usually when conceding the champions still have a problem against low blocks and long-ball teams. The admission invites Amorim to play the same way. The onus is on Liverpool to find the solutions their summer recruitment policy was designed for.Andy HunterLiverpool vManchester United, Sunday 4.30pm10Hammers’ lack of forward thinkingWest Ham’s striker shortage is back in the spotlight. Niclas Füllkrug has succumbed to injury again, leaving Callum Wilson as Nuno Espírito Santo’s only specialist option up front. It is not the best planning. Wilson, 33, has made one start since signing on a free transfer, and has been an unused substitute since Nuno was hired in place of Graham Potter last month. Alternatives, though, are thin on the ground. Nuno could be forced to ask Jarrod Bowen to shift into the middle againstBrentford, but the captain is far more effective on the right. Who else, though? Lucas Paquetá is an uncomfortable fit as a false 9. Callum Marshall made his Premier League debut by coming on for Füllkrug against Arsenal this month. There could be an opening for the 20-year-old Northern Ireland international.JSWest Hamv Brentford, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal711162Liverpool74153Tottenham Hotspur78144AFC Bournemouth73145Man City79136Crystal Palace74127Chelsea74118Everton72119Sunderland711110Man Utd7-21011Newcastle71912Brighton70913Aston Villa7-1914Fulham7-3815Leeds7-4816Brentford7-3717Nottm Forest7-7518Burnley7-8419West Ham7-10420Wolverhampton7-92Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendNottingham ForestChelseaBrighton & Hove AlbionNewcastle UnitedBurnleyLeeds UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets.“The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.”The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the decision was a “national disgrace” and urged Starmer to reverse it.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Villa saidthe local safety advisory group had instructed the club that “no away fans will be permitted”.“The club are in continuous ­dialogue with Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local authorities throughout this ongoing process, with the safety of supporters attending the match and the safety of local residents at the forefront of any decision,” Villa said.There was significant unrest when Maccabi played Ajax on 7 ­November. A report by Dutch police into the ­disorder, which lasted two days, found that Maccabi fans had torn a Palestinian flag down from the facade of a local building and burned it, shouted “Fuck you, Palestine”and vandalised a taxi, among a series of incidents before the fixture. After the match, what were described by Amsterdam’s mayor as a series of “hit-and-run” assaults on Maccabi fans, led to five people being taken to hospital and a further 20 to 30 being slightly injured. Sixty-two people were arrested, mainly for ­public order offences.The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, posted on X: “Shameful decision! I call on the UK ­authorities to reverse this coward decision!” The Palestine Solidarity Campaign said the match should be cancelled, writing on X: “Israeli football teams shouldn’t play in international tournaments whilst it commits genocide and apartheid.”The Independent MP forBirmingham Perry Barr, Ayoub Khan, said: “I welcome the Safety Advisory Group’s decision. With so much hostility and ­uncertainty around the match, it was only right to take drastic measures.”Ajax were prevented last month from having fans at a Champions League match in Marseille after the French interior ministry banned “anyone claiming to be an Ajax Amsterdam supporter” from ­travelling between the French border and the southern city. Ajax said they had been informed the decision had been taken “on grounds of public safety and security”.The same week, the prefecture of Naples prevented the selling of tickets to Eintracht Frankfurt fans hoping to travel to their Champions League match against Napoli.Uefa said: “In all cases, the competent local authorities remain responsible for decisions related to the safety and security of matches taking place on their territory, such decisions being determined on the basis of thorough risk assessments, which vary from match to match and take into consideration previous circumstances.”Explore more on these topicsMaccabi Tel AvivAston VillaEuropa LeagueBirminghamnewsShareReuse this content"

It was not pretty in the Estádio da Luz, but it was enough, just, with Arsenal’s lack of cutting edge remaining a major concern.“Really happy because we have won. It’s not easy to come here after losing the first game, so it was really important for us. At the same time, we need to be better,” Caldentey told Disney+. Asked what they need to be better at she said: “Almost everything. We need to be more consistent ­defensively and we have so much quality up front that we should score more goals.“It’s not one or two players, it’s all of us. Football is about momentum and sometimes it’s hard to change that dynamic.”The return to the city of theirheroic underdog triumph over Barcelonain the Champions League final in May, this time in Benfica’s home instead of Sporting CP’s José Alvalade Stadium, was shrouded in far less optimism this time round.Benfica v Arsenal: Women’s Champions League – liveRead moreThen, Arsenal fans had travelled with hopes tempered, given the scale of the task, but spirits high, after a stellar run to their second final. This time, the side that arrived in Lisbon was a more beleaguered one after a disappointing start to a season full of promise.The Gunners have dropped seven points in their opening six WSL games and went four games without a win, includinga 2-1 loss in their ­Champions League openeragainst Lyonnes, before Sunday’s less than convincing1-0 win over Brightonhalted that frustrating run.There were several changes to the team that earned the win on Sunday, including Lotte Wubben-Moy coming in for the 19-year-old centre-back Katie Reid, who has a groin injury.In the first half, the story was a familiar one, Arsenal dominated possession, accruing almost 70%, but failed to make that count, a cutting edge in the final third mysteriously missing with Benfica matching them with five shots and bettering them two on target to Arsenal’s none.It would take a bit of chaos in Benfica’s area to give Arsenal the lead after the break, Caldentey’s cross towards Mead in the middle pinballed off Beatriz Cameirão before Diana Gomes and Mead got touches in with the latter doing enough to send it rolling slowly over the line.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

New Zealand’s have played 28 games, the latest was this month. These are groups who spend a lot of time together, but before the start of their Twenty20 series on Saturday both chiselled some space out of their schedule to do something surprisingly unusual with each other: nothing very much.Brendon McCullum took his team to Queenstown in New Zealand’s Southern Alps where, in Harry Brook’s words, they were “just left to our own devices”. There was some hiking, a bit of go-karting and, inevitably, a lot of golf.“We had an amazing time,” Brook said. “They’ve got some amazing golf courses down there and we were lucky enough to get on a couple of them. A couple of lads managed to get out and explore Queenstown. We had a few drinks here and there and team meals.No Ashes talk in England camp, says Harry Brook before New Zealand seriesRead more“We had a lot of fun – it was about trying to spend a bit of time together because we don’t really get that in the white-ball [team]. If you’re having a lot of fun off the field and enjoying spending time with the lads, then it’s going to be even better on the field. So I encourage everybody under mine and Baz’s leadership to just enjoy themselves.”The Black Caps, meanwhile, were in the spa town of Hanmer Springs, attempting something very similar with the aid of thermal pools and water slides. “It was the first time in a very long time we had everyone in the room, everyone who’s involved in the Black Caps touring party and all the contracted players,” said Rachin Ravindra.“We’ve got a new coach [Rob Walter] and trying to understand our environment and go back to what we’ve been doing really well for the last few years and getting together is special. It’s more than your performances on the field, it’s also getting on well as mates and getting to know the coaches and support staff. The more we can understand and care for each other, the better.”Matt Henry, the New Zealand seamer, said: “When you have a small window to get guys together and work on the environment it’s always important. In the moving landscape of international cricket there’s people coming from all around the world and it’s important that when you get together you make sure you enjoy it.“It’s probably always been our strength, the people we have. It’s amazing to play for New Zealand, but to be able to share a dressing room with mates is pretty special too. It’s always good to acknowledge that and come to a series refreshed.”View image in fullscreenHarry Brook signs autographs for fans in Christchurch.Photograph: Sanka Vidanagama/AFP/Getty ImagesThat feeling of being refreshed may be hard to maintain when some England players left home last Friday knowing they will not return for three months, with these three T20s to be followed by the same number of one-day internationals and then the short flight to Australia for the Ashes. There is an awareness that these extended periods away should not come to be seen as a grind.“Touring’s awesome,” Brook said. “I get to see some of the best places in the world, experience some of the greatest things with a load of my mates.

The first edition of the World Cup in 1930 was hosted in and won by Uruguay.Fifa president Gianni Infantinomet representativesfrom Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina at Trump Tower in New York last month for the first formal discussions about a proposal that was first raised informally by the Uruguayan Football Association at a Fifa Council meeting last March.Concacaf president opposes plans for 64-team Fifa World Cup in 2030Read moreThe delegation in New York was led by Conmbol president, Paraguayan Alejandro Dominguez, and also featured the Paraguay and Uruguay heads of state, as well as the presidents of their federations and Argentina’s.Multiple sources have told the Guardian however, that they have yet to gain the support of the other Conmebol members, who are concerned about the impact of World Cup expansion on their qualifying competition, the main source of revenue for many of the national associations.South American World Cup qualifying is currently an 18-game round-robin single-table competition, with all 10 countries playing each other home and away. The top six qualify automatically, with the seventh team entering inter-confederation play-offs featuring six teams from all over the world.Such is the strength in depth in South America that Brazil finished fifth in the competition that concluded last month, while regular World Cup attendees Chile finished bottom, reflecting a competitiveness that gives the qualifiers real value in terms of TV rights and sponsorship deals. Expanding the World Cup to 64 teams would result in eight or nine South American sides being given places, raising concerns about the future of the qualifying competition.There is also understood to be a strong belief among the other Conmebol members that Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina are pursuing expansion for their own ends and would be the sole beneficiaries. During last month’s meeting in New York they proposed staging the entire group stage of the 2030 World Cup, rather than awarding additional games to other countries in South America.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Uefa president, Aleksander Čeferin, has described it as a “bad idea” that would reduce the quality of the tournament and Concacaf president, Victor Montagliani, has said “it just doesn’t feel right.”The World Cup has grown significantly in recent decades, increasing from 16 to 24 teams in 1982, growing again to 32 in 1998 before becoming a 48-team competition next summer. A 64-team World Cup would feature 128 matches, double the number played at the most recent tournament in Qatar three years ago and 24 more than next year’s World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, which will be the first time it has been staged across three countries.Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa’s Council, but it was not discussed at their most recent meeting in Zurich on 2 October.Explore more on these topicsWorld CupFifaWorld Cup 2030Football politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The last remaining candidate is due to pull out on Friday because of an arcane election rule.Tim Mayer, a former FIA senior steward with 15 years in the role until he wassacked last November, was one of three candidates who had announced they would oppose Ben Sulayem, alongside the former racing driver Laura Villars and the Belgian journalist Virginie Philippot.George Russell stays at Mercedes next season but door not shut on pursuit of VerstappenRead moreNone of them, however, are able to meet the FIA requirements for the election process. Mayer is expected to formally announce the end of his campaign in Austin on Friday , the Guardian understands, where he will make clear the reasons behind it and his assessment of the current electoral process.The regulation in question requires any presidential candidate to submit six prospective vice-presidents, one from each of the FIA’s global regions.Extraordinarily, the person who has unwittingly found themselves at the heart of the issue is the Brazilian wife of the former F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, Fabiana Ecclestone, who is the only world council representative for South America and has already declared for Ben Sulayem.With no other representatives from South America, candidates cannot name a potential vice-president for the region and are thus ­ineligible to stand, leaving Ben Sulayem ­unopposed in December’s election.It is believed Mayer will nonetheless continue to campaign in order to demonstrate that he would have been a credible alternative.The governing body said: “The FIA presidential election is a structured and democratic process, to ensure fairness and integrity at every stage. Prospective candidates have had since the publication of the detailed information on 13 June to prepare their applications.”Recently Ben Sulayem has come under ­increased criticism surrounding the governance of the FIA, including ­accusations of a concentration of power in his hands and that of the senate and in limiting the efficacy of the ­ethics committee that would allow enquiries to be suppressed by the president.David Richards, the chair of Motorsport UK, noted he had “concerns about the erosion of accountability and good governance within the FIA”. While the former deputy president for sport Robert Reid, who resigned in April, cited his unhappiness with “critical decisions being made without due process” and a “fundamental breakdown in governance standards”.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

News of his death caused an outpouring of grief across the world and thousands of people lined the streets for his funeral.His body was found in his home in Hyde after police received a call from a concerned neighbour, later revealed to have been his manager, Paul Speak, who alongside Hatton’s son and brother, was a pallbearer at his funeral.The former world champion had been open about his struggles with clinical depression and substance abuse, saying on one occasion that he “was coming off the rails” with his drink and drug use, describing himself previously as being “like a runaway train”.The police coroner’s officer Alison Catlow told the inquest Hatton was last seen by family members on Friday 12 September, when he seemed well and there was no cause for concern.The court heard that the next day Hatton did not appear at an event that he was scheduled to attend, and on the morning of Sunday 14 September Speak went to Hatton’s home in order to escort him toManchesterairport to fly to Dubai.When he didn’t get a response, Speak entered Hatton’s home, where he “found him unresponsive” . Speak called the emergency services, but Hatton was pronounced dead.The full inquest into Hatton’s death is scheduled to begin at Manchester south coroner court on 20 March 2026.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

In the Bank’s August monetary policy report, it cited changes in sewerage charges, bus fares, vehicle excise duty and VAT on private school fees as “administered prices” contributing to inflation.Reeves pointed to the recent competition review of vets practices, and the government’s decision to freeze prescription prices, as examples of what can be done.The chancellor is expected to deliver a package of tax increases and spending cuts on 26 November to meether fiscal rulesin the face of deteriorating forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).She acknowledged that wealthy taxpayers could expect to pay more – but stressed that she was determined not to deter this group from staying in the UK.“I want Britain to be a great place for talent, for entrepreneurs, for successful individuals to come, and that requires getting the balance right,” Reeves said. “But I do think those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share of tax and I think you can see that from my actions last year at the budget.”She added: “I want the UK to remain an attractive place, but we’ve got to get the balance right and I do think that if Britain is your home you should pay your taxes here.”Rachel Reeves should consider welfare cuts in budget, IFS saysRead moreReeves also said she hoped to secure promises of more investment in the UK from major pharmaceutical companies, in exchange for a more favourable deal on drug prices.“We do need to make sure that we are an attractive place for pharmaceuticals, and that includes on pricing, but in return for that, we want to see more investment flow to Britain,” she said.The government is intalks with pharmaceuticals firms, which are demanding more generous treatment by the NHS, under pressure from Donald Trump to lower prices in the US. At the same time, ministers are pressing the US not to impose tariffs on drug imports.“We’ve been very successful with the US in terms of negotiating lower tariffs ... and of course, we want that to be the case with pharmaceuticals as well. But we are in the middle of those negotiations at the moment,” the chancellor said.Pressed for details about how she could raise additional revenue from richer taxpayers, the chancellor said: “We’re not going to be introducing a wealth tax. We already have a number of taxes in the UK that do tax wealth and do tax wealthy people, and some of those we increased in the budget last year.”She highlighted changes at last year’s budget, including the crackdown on non-doms, VAT on private school fees and higher taxes on private jets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just in the last week or two, JP Morgan have made a £300m investment in Bournemouth for example.“Financial services is one of our big success stories in the UK and we want to make sure that we have a competitive environment. But also we want to make sure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. We’ve got to get the balance right there.”Reeves also confirmed that she was considering downgrading the status of the OBR’s spring forecast, so that she would only be measured against her fiscal rules once a year, in the autumn budget.She said she would be discussing this issue with the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, at a meeting later on Thursday – the IMF has called for the UK to change its approach.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyRachel ReevesBudget 2025BudgetBankingTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

And many of those men are still going about their daily lives, enjoying the benefits of their power.”Her view was echoed by women’s rights experts and campaigners, who told the Guardian that wide-ranging reforms were needed to challenge deep-rooted societal and institutional misogyny.Charlotte Proudman, a barrister and women’s rights campaigner, described the memoir as both a “personal account of unimaginable abuse” as well as “a mirror held up to a system that still enables powerful men to exploit girls and women with impunity”.She added that the account exposes “the network of privilege” that protected Epstein and Maxwell. “Epstein was not an aberration, he was a symptom of a culture that normalises male entitlement and protects those at the top,” she said.Mags Lesiak, a criminologist at the University of Cambridge who researches gender-based violence, agreed that the memoir underscores how “sexual exploitation is not an individual aberration – it’s a system”.“Grooming doesn’t begin with violence. It begins with flattery, opportunity, charm and access,” she said, noting that despite public scepticism about Giuffre’s lack of agency, her research shows that psychological dependence is created long before violence happens.“What’s most chilling is not Epstein’s uniqueness, but how unexceptional his methods were. The psychology of coercive control, emotional conditioning and ‘reward-punishment’ cycles, mirrors what we see in countless abuse cases – from elite trafficking networks to private homes.”Andrea Simon, the director of the End Violence AgainstWomenCoalition, said the memoir sheds light on the ways “perpetrators with power, wealth and status are able to silence victims of sexual violence by weaponising the law”.“This entitlement has its roots in gender inequality and the power and control it produces. Until we tackle inequality, we won’t address the root causes of violence against women and girls,” she said.Giuffre, who died by suicide on 25 April 2025, wrote in her book that many people were complicit in Epstein’s crimes, because they “watched and they didn’t care”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The study found 60 fraud cases, ranging from £100 to £428,249.Most of the scams (85%) emerged from relationships built by the fraudsters on social media and dating sites. In one case, a firm failed to identify fraud when six payments totalling more than £131,000 were sent overseas.In almost half of the cases, the victims did not give the real reason for payments. In another fraud that went through, a victim made 15 international payments, worth £190,000, and claimed to be buying international property. But the staff handling the transactions did not seek documentation or question the use of multiple accounts in different names, said the report.The FCA report said some firms did not properly safeguard victims after the fraud emerged, even though there were clear signs they were vulnerable. “For example, one victim expressed suicidal thoughts and another received threats of violence from the fraudster,” it said.The watchdog said banks and payment providers could bring in measures to better protect customers, including improved monitoring systems, better training for staff and providing compassionate aftercare.‘I can’t meet, I’m on an oil rig’: the signs it might be a romance fraudRead moreSteve Smart, the FCA’s joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, described romance fraud as a “vicious crime”, adding: “All too often it is the vulnerable that fall victim. The impact – financially and personally – can be devastating.”Fraudsters typically try to identify peoplewho are lonely or isolated. They often claim to be working abroad, and are therefore unable to meet, and say they need money to fund a medical emergency.Santander has said it has seen almost £5.5m stolen through romance frauds since the start of the year. Michelle Pilsworth, the bank’s head of fraud, said the criminals increasingly ask for gift cards from victims.The consumer group Which? said banks and payment operators that fail to protect customers should have action taken against them.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeScamsBanco SantanderConsumer affairsCrimeBankingFinancial Conduct AuthoritynewsShareReuse this content"

The meeting was said to have discussed abortion rights, free speech and online safety laws.ADF, which supports free speech and religious freedom, has worked in Britain to help challenge the prosecutions of Christians who were arrested for praying silently outside abortion clinics, breaching “buffer zones”. The group, which is non-politically partisan and says it is a human rights charity, said it was not present at the meeting and had never met withReform UKpoliticians to discuss abortion law.In response to the meeting, theLiberal Democratsaccused Farage of working with Trump officials and anti-abortion campaigners who want to water down women’s rights and urged him to explain what was discussed.Daisy Cooper, the party’s deputy leader, also called on the government to summon the US ambassador to get to the bottom of “what looks like a blatant attempt to interfere in the UK’s domestic laws”.“Nigel Farage needs to come clean … and explain if his party would weaken women’s rights if he came to power,” she said.“The Liberal Democrats will stand up against these attempts to turn Trump’s America into Farage’s Britain and roll back the clock on decades of progress.”Reform was approached for comment. Asked by the New York Times about his relationship with the ADF, Farage said his party talks with “all sorts of groups” and denied speaking against abortion, telling a reporter that she was “talking utter bollocks”. He said that abortion was “No 468” on Reform UK’s agenda and noted he had “hardly ever spoken about it in 30 years”.“My point was that the 24-week limit was looking in serious jeopardy given that we actually spend a fortune saving babies at 22 weeks,” he said. “Maybe we need to rethink all of that because there is clearly a legal inconsistency.”The New York Times also reported that the ADF helped to arrange Farage’s three-hour testimony to US Congress earlier this year, where he described Britain as “awful” and criticised the Online Safety Act.An ADF International spokesman said: “The Liberal Democrats have made allegations here that are simply wrong. To be clear, ADF International has never met with any Reform UK politician to discuss abortion law. We never attended any breakfast meeting between US embassy staff and Nigel Farage. And it was the US House Judiciary Committee, not ADF International, that decided who should testify before Congress.“The reality is ADF International is a registered human rights charity in the UK and is non-politically partisan. We are committed to tackling the free speech crisis in this country and to protecting fundamental freedoms for all across the world.”A spokesman for the US embassy in London said officials regularly met those from different faiths and “elements of the political spectrum” in Britain and “anywhere else where freedom of expression is under threat.”In February, the US vice-president, JD Vance, told the Munich Security Conference that UK prosecutions of those defying abortion buffer zones showed a “backslide away from conscience rights” and a “retreat” from free speech. He highlighted the case of Adam Smith-Connor who was convicted last October of breaching a designated “safe zone” outside a Bournemouth abortion clinic.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageLiberal DemocratsAbortionTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

An hour and a half later, Benkired was filmed in the entrance hallway of the building surrounded by suitcases including a large trunk.Benkired, who was said to have given confused accounts of events, was examined by several psychiatrists and psychologists but judged able to stand trial. She has been held in Fresnes prison, south of Paris, for the last three years.Shortly after the killing, Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National attempted to make political capital out of the alleged murderer’s irregular migration status. Éric Pauget, of the rightwing Les Républicains, said in parliament that Lola had been killed as a result of France’s purported weakness on immigration.However, MPs were urged by ministers of the centrist government to “show a little decency”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will also address several other far-reaching changes proposed by Noboa, including a reduction of seats in the legislative assembly, party funding and foreign military bases.View image in fullscreenA volcanic crater lake in San Cristóbal, Galápagos Islands.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe referendum will be the most controversial move yet by the president, who has already prompted alarm with several pieces of legislation that critics say undermine environmental safeguards and democratic checks and balances.A protected areas law, for example, purportedly enhances environmental sustainability and the management of conservation areas, but Indigenous groups say it is a ruse to bypass their right to free, prior and informed consent, while potentially opening up protected land to privatisation and extractive industries.A national solidarity law was ostensibly passed to strengthen the government’s authority and resources to tackle organised crime, but it has been used, say observers, to militarise public security and provide impunity for police and military killings carried out in the name of a war against gangs. A new intelligence law has given unprecedented surveillance powers to the administration, which can intercept communications without a court order. Meanwhile, a public integrity law, which claims to tame corruption, has become a tool to crack down on civil society.Social unrest has mounted steadily in Ecuador. The country has one of thehighest homicide ratesin the world. Rising prices of food and diesel have added to the tensions, prompting an ongoing national strike. Last month, an Indigenous land defender, Efraín Fueres, wasshot and killedby the army during a protest against the high cost of living, a lack of medicine in hospitals, the deterioration of schools and growing social insecurity.Demonstrators are also angry that at least 61 civil society leaders and organisations have had their bank accounts frozen, pending an “unjustified private enrichment” investigation by the public prosecutors office.The Guardian has seen a list of those facing persecution. More than half were Indigenous activists, several of them campaigning against mines. Another quarter were environmental defenders. The rest were academics, journalists, women’s rights activists and local politicians.Among those under scrutiny was the Pachamama Foundation, which released astatement sayingit would resist this attempted intimidation. “We categorically reject the criminalisation process that has been initiated,” thefoundation said.The accusations come at a time when Noboa’s administration has been criticised for pushing ahead with mining projects that had been blocked by public consultations, and accused of doing nothing to implement the 2023referendum decisionto halt oil production in block 43 of the Yasuni national park, an area of the Amazon rainforest famed for its ecological diversity. Instead, the president has subsumed the environment ministry inside the mining ministry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

All of this is being systematically trampled on by the government of President Daniel Noboa. The president does not want to respect the constitution or public consultation.”Acosta sees this as part of a global trend, led by the US president, Donald Trump: “What is happening in the United States is encouraging many governments in Latin America, and in Ecuador in particular, to mobilise extractivist forces that are destroying the ecological balance and affecting Indigenous communities.”Justices fear the rule of law is under threat; in recent months, the constitutional court has been the only brake on presidential power, successfully delaying several of Noboa’s moves to remove civil liberties or environmental protections. When the justicessuspendedsecurity legislation in August, Noboa denounced them as “enemies of the people” and organised protests outside the court.In the past decade, Ecuador’s highest court has also set a global example in its rulings in favour of the rights of nature,most famously in 2021when it declared mining permits in the Los Cedros cloud forest were unconstitutional because they threatened the biodiversity of a protected forest.The retired constitutional court judge Agustín Grijalva, who played a key role in the Los Cedros ruling, said his former colleagues were under intense pressure, which could get worse depending on the referendum outcome. “They want to reform or replace the constitution so they can impeach constitutional judges,” he said. “They will have their own court. And that is very dangerous for democracy and also for nature. It would put at risk all of the rulings of the past.”Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

It argues in the document that biofuels – made from a wide variety of organic matter such as sugar cane in the case of ethanol – will displace fossil fuels and that they represent a benefit to the climate and environment.But this is disputed by green experts and campaigners, who point out thatbiofuel productionis resulting inincreased deforestation in many regions, leading to thereplacement of land that is rich in species with monocultures, and reducing the land available for food production. Astudy by the Transport and Environment thinktank, published this month, shows that at present “biofuels are responsible globally for 16% more CO2emissions than the fossil fuels they replace due to the indirect impacts of farming and deforestation”.The report found that:By 2030, biofuel crops would require land the size of France, which would make it equivalent to the sixth-largest country in terms of arable land use globallyA fifth of vegetable oil is used for cars rather than food.That 3,000 litres of water are needed to drive 100km on biofuels.That solar panels could create as much energy as biofuels while using just 3% as much land.The draft pledge stipulates that the increased volume of biofuels should come from environmentally sustainable sources.Andreas Sieber, an associate director of policy and campaigns at350.org, said: “So-called ‘sustainable fuels’ must never deflect from the central task: transitioning away from fossil fuels and scaling up renewables. While Brazil’s interest in biofuels may partly come from good intentions, presenting ‘sustainable fuels’ as an equal pillar to renewables is misguided. These fuels often exaggerate their climate benefits, worsen food insecurity, and drive biodiversity loss through monocultures of corn, soy and sugarcane. The transition away from fossil fuels must remain the overarching goal.“It’s particularly worrying to already see countries like Italy and Japan join this initiative and co-opt this narrative for industrial or political convenience. That’s not climate leadership, it’s a dangerous distraction.”Cian Delaney, a biofuels campaigner at T&E, said: “This pledge involves doubling the world’s supply of biofuels. It’s difficult to imagine a scenario where this doesn’t require more land clearance. Without any commitment from countries to meet the target without clearing more land, this will be devastating for the climate, ecosystems and food security.”The Guardian has also seen a draft of the agenda for the leaders’ summit, which Brazilis hosting in Belémon 6 and 7 November, before the start of the fortnight-longCop30 climate conferencein the same city on 10 November.The plans reflect a divided government, with an uneasy coalition headed by the president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, that includes people ranging from some of the world’s most ambitious environmentalists to diehard supporters of agribusiness.The opening day will focus on forests, including a Brazilian initiative, supported by the UK and other European governments, to establish a “Tropical Forests Forever Facility” that aims to raise $125bn (£93bn) to support standing forests. This will be followed by a forest-themed afternoon of speeches, possibly including a “presentation by a representative of Indigenous peoples”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOn the second day, the leaked plans – still tentative – suggest there will be a discussion about the energy transition. This is a contentious topic. The world agreed at Cop28 in Dubai to“transition away from fossil fuels”, but last year, Saudi Arabia blocked attempts to move forward with this goal. In preliminary discussions for Cop30, Saudi Arabia has again tried to remove this from the agenda. But the Brazilian environment minister, Marina Silva, has pushed for more action and the leak suggests this will be under discussion by leaders.The crucial issue ofhow to meet the Paris agreement goalof limiting global heating to 1.5C will be addressed at the end of the leaders’ summit, in a discussion of countries’plans on greenhouse gas emissions, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs).Lula will also call for stronger action on debt forgiveness for poor countries, in exchange for investments in environmental protection and clean energy.A spokesperson from Brazil’s foreign affairs ministry said: “Brazil is not proposing that countries quadruple biofuels. The proponents of the pledge (which include Japan, Italy, India, among others) are calling upon countries to support quadrupling production and use of sustainable fuels – a group of gaseous and liquid fuels that include e-fuels, biogases, biofuels, hydrogen and its derivatives.“The proposed fourfold increase is a global goal (countries are not expected to individually quadruple production). It is based on an IEA report released this week that said this production increase is both feasible and necessary to reduce emissions, particularly from hard-to-abate sectors. The IEA report is a sound, scientific document underpinning the proposed Belém 4x pledge. The word ‘sustainable’ is not used lightly, neither in the report nor in the pledge.“For a fuel to be sustainable, it must have low-GHG intensity over its lifecycle, measured in grams of CO2equivalent by megajoule of fuel (gCO2;MJ). It also needs to comply with a set of non-GHG criteria, such as biodiversity conservation, sustainable water management and compliance with social safeguards. These concerns are taken seriously and have been integrated into the design of the declaration itself.”Explore more on these topicsBiofuelsBrazilCop30Luiz Inácio Lula da SilvaGreenhouse gas emissionsTrees and forestsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Other microhylid species in New Guinea and Australia breed in a similar manner, bypassing the tadpole stage.View image in fullscreenThe species were found on Dauan Island in the Torres Strait.Photograph: Brook Mitchell/Getty ImagesHoskin said the new frogs’ closest relatives were up in the central ranges of New Guinea. “A lot of the southern plains of New Guinea are a bit … drier,” he said. “These two frogs have only survived on this island because of those deep boulder fields that buffer them from the heat.“All three species will certainly only be on Dauan Island. There’s no other bouldery habitat anywhere nearby, either on the other islands or on the southern New Guinea plains.”Torenzo Elisala, a Dauan Island councillor, said the discoveries “highlight how special our island is”.“Our community has been tucked away in the Guda Maluilgal nation for millennia, sharing the spiritual connection from flora to fauna to that of our ancestors who lived on these lands before us,” he said.“These discoveries are exciting to learn more about science and add to the tourism potential of the island.”Hoskin described the new species intwopaperspublished in the journal Zootaxa.Explore more on these topicsAmphibiansWildlifeAnimalsReptilesShareReuse this content"

But it added that the levels were similar to those seen when the flu season came early in 2022-23.Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: “It looks like flu cases are going up early this year. Seasonal epidemics often get going in children first and then spread through the adult population.”According to the latestreport by the UKHSA, which covers 6-12 October, influenza-like-illness consultations in primary care rose to 5.4 per 100,000 people, compared with 4.2 per 100,000 in the previous week.There has also been a rise in influenza hospitalisations, increasing to 1.27 per 100,000 people in the most recent week, compared with 0.73 per 100,000 the week before.Dr Conall Watson, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: “This week’s data is showing a rise in positive tests for flu, particularly in children and younger adults, as well an increase in GP and A&E attendances. It is relatively early in the autumn to be seeing these increases and we will be monitoring this closely in the coming weeks.”Watson added that it was “absolutely crucial” for everyone eligible for a flu vaccine to book their appointment. “It could make all the difference in avoiding severe illness and hospitalisation,” he said.Among those eligible for a free flu jabare people aged 65 or over, pregnant women, people with certain long-term health conditions and people who live in a care home. A nasal spray vaccination is also available for children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even among children we see severe cases admitted to hospital every winter,” he said. “Vaccination reduces the risk of getting flu and of getting seriously ill with it.”Explore more on these topicsFluVaccines and immunisationEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

We will provide further information to our communities and stakeholders as well.”It added that it wanted to ensure that “our staff, intent, artists, contractors and suppliers, who are all a part of our community, are heard and considered”.Zahirah Zapanta, who appeared in season six of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK, has claimed they haven’t been paid for their appearance, saying in an Instagram story: “It is deeply disappointing to share that Manchester Pride has failed to pay me, along with many other artists who performed at the events.Zapanta added that “repeated emails and requests regarding outstanding payments have been ignored”.The event, which took place at the end of August,came under firein 2021 for ending its funding of two community charities while giving its chief executive a £20,000 pay rise.The BBC reported that Saki Yew, who was on RuPaul’s Drag Race UK in 2024, is also among those who say they haven’t been paid.Yew told the BBC: “As performers, we’re used to waiting for money but there’s no communication and no answer.

North Yorkshire police said this week that although theCrown Prosecution Serviceconcluded there was evidence of assisted suicide, it was not in the public interest to prosecute her.InEnglandand Wales, “assisting a suicide” is a crime with a maximum sentence of 14 years. A similar law is in place in Northern Ireland. There is no specific crime of “assisting a suicide” in Scotland, but it is possible that helping a person to die could lead to prosecution for culpable homicide.Shackleton’s husband decided to end his life at Dignitas, in Zurich, six years after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.She said his condition had deteriorated to the point where he would choke on his food. He considered options for ending his life and decided on an assisted death at Dignitas.“It was his choice, his autonomy, how he died and when he wanted to die,” Shackletontold ITV Tyne Tees.She sought advice before travelling to the clinic with her husband and handed herself in to police at Manchester airport last December.“I had literally been crying for 24 hours and couldn’t see properly and could just see uniforms. It wasn’t actually police, it was Border Force, but they were absolutely brilliant with me. They were just so kind and compassionate,” she said.After hearing that she would not be prosecuted, she said: “The worst thing in my life had already happened. There’s nothing anyone could have done to me to make anything any worse.“But for my children, for my boys, it was lovely that I could give them that news that they didn’t have to worry about their mum any more.”Shetold the Mirror: “I have had the excruciating pressure of a possible court case being brought against me.“If my husband had taken his own life in this country the scenario would have been extremely different. I would not have been criminalised, I would have been supported … However if someone decides to take their life in a foreign country, the family member who is with them is automatically under suspicion.”ANorth Yorkshirepolice spokesperson said: “This has clearly been a complex and sensitive investigation which has required detailed examination by the Crown Prosecution Service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The trauma of a months-long investigation lays bare the cruelty of the status quo on assisted dying in the UK. No one should have to endure a criminal investigation for an act of compassion at the end of their loved one’s life.”The House of Lords has begun detailed scrutiny of aprivate member’s bill to legalise assisted dyingin England and Wales, brought forward by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater. The bill passed its third reading in the Commons in June.Dignity in Dying said: “The status quo is not neutral, it is actively harmful. It forces dying people to travel abroad to seek a dignified death and leaves their loved ones facing police interviews, investigations and legal uncertainty at the very worst time in their lives.”Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingCrown Prosecution ServiceNorth YorkshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Her capacity for empathy, and compassion towards people, animals and those less fortunate, was immeasurable.“She was a protector, a voice for the voiceless and a beacon of love in a world that often forgets the importance of kindness.“Georgina will be forever remembered and loved for her funny, caring nature and being unapologetically herself.“Our lives have been changed irrevocably by her loss, and she is missed beyond measure, which is an absolute testament to the person she was. Beautiful, inside and out.”Birtwistle has also been charged with a further six counts of assault and one count of controlling and coercive behaviour in relation to three other women.At the brief hearing, he was bailed until his next court appearance. Magistrates imposed conditions on his bail, which stated he must not make contact with any of the other three alleged victims, must live at a specific address, and must surrender his passport at a police station.Birtwistle, who was not asked to enter a plea, is due to appear at Wolverhampton crown court on 13 November for a plea and case management hearing.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now Donald Trump has imperial ambitions of his own.On Wednesday, the US president unveiled plans for a grand arch in Washington that has already been dubbed the “Arc de Trump”.The project, likely to be seen by critics as evidence of monumental hubris, is the latest attempt by property developer-turned-politician Trump totransform the US capital for good.Hetold wealthy guests about the ideaduring a glitzy dinner in the White House East Room. The president pointed to a map displaying its proposed location as a gateway to Washington from northern Virginia.“Every time somebody rides over that beautiful bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, they literally say, something is supposed to be here,” he said.The location is overlooked by Arlington House, the former home of Robert E Lee, who led the army of northern Virginia on the Confederate side during the civil war. Various statues of Lee were removed after the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020.But, Trump added: “That’s Arlington Memorial Bridge and, at the end of it, you have a circle that was built 150 years ago … In 1902, they were going to put a statue of Robert E Lee up, would have been OK with me – would’ve been on with a lot of the people in this room.”Trump picked up and showed off 3D models of the project in three sizes with a gold Lady Liberty statue on top. “Small, medium, large,” said Trump, eliciting laughter in the room. “I happen to like the large one. Why are you shocked?”Among the many differences between Trump’s first and second terms is his willingness to unleash his inner builder.Wednesday’s dinner was designed to thank billionaires and top companies for donating to another of his pet projects: a new $250m ballroom at the White House. He opened the curtains of the East Room to show guests where work has started on the giant ballroom, the biggest addition to the White House in more than a century.He said the building would have four walls of bulletproof glass and a capacity of 1,000 people, and would be able to host a presidential inauguration.The guests reportedly included representatives from tech firms such as Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft and Palantir and the defence giant Lockheed Martin, as well as twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the founders of crypto platform Gemini.Trump told the gathering: “So many of you have been really, really generous. I mean, couple of you I have sitting here are saying: ‘Sir, would $25m be appropriate?’ I said: ‘I’ll take it.’“So, we are going to have a phenomenal ballroom. It’s going to be one of the best anywhere in the world. There won’t be anything like it, actually. It’s four sides of beautiful glass. We will be able to have state dinners. We would literally not even have state dinners because it is not set up.”Trump has said the ballroom will be built entirely with private money. It includes $22m from a settlement with YouTube in September after the company suspended his account over the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol.It is the biggest in a series of renovations Trump has made to the White House since returning to power in January, including erecting flagpoles, covering the Oval Office with gold decor (the New York Times called it a “gilded rococo nightmare”) and paving over the Rose Garden.Along the colonnade, he installed a “presidential walk of fame” with gold-framed pictures of every president except Joe Biden, who is replaced by an autopen. In recent days, he placed a statue of George Washington in the garden and a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln beside the Oval Office.Accordingto the Axios news site, Trump has treated Benjamin Netanyahu and his Finnish counterpart, Alexander Stubb, to 40-minute tours of the White House renovations.He told guests on Wednesday: “It’s so relaxing for me. Real estate is relaxing. For a lot of people, real estate is a very trying business. I’ve always liked it. I’ve always done well with it.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpWashington DCUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We believe a boycott of Israeli film institutions violates our policies. While we respect the rights of individuals and groups to express their views and advocate for causes, we will continue to align our business practices with the requirements of our policies and the law.”Industry luminaries including Javier Bardem, Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo signed the pledge, organized and published last month by the group Film Workers forPalestine, that commits signatories not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with what it considers complicit institutions – including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies. According to the pledge, complicity includes “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them”.An FAQ section specified that the pledge, inspired by a boycott of cultural institutions that contributed to the end of apartheid in South Africa, didn’t prohibit signees from working with Israeli individuals, but targeted national institutions.“The call is for film workers to refuse to work with Israeli institutions that are complicit in Israel’s human rights abuses against the Palestinian people,” read a statement announcing the pledge. “This refusal takes aim at institutional complicity, not identity. There are also 2 million Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, and Palestinian civil society has developed context sensitive guidelines for that community.”“We answer the call of Palestinian film-makers, who haveurgedthe international film industry to refuse silence, racism and dehumanization, as well as to ‘do everything humanly possible’ to end complicity in their oppression,” it added.Days after publication, Paramount becamethe first studioto respond to the boycott, when Melissa Zukerman, the chief communications officer, said the company did “not agree with recent efforts to boycott Israeli film-makers”.In a statement, the company, which was recently acquired by the family of billionaire Larry Ellison and private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners, said that “the global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world” and that “silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace”.In its own statement, Film Workers for Palestine pointed out Ellison’sclose relationshipwith the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and said that the pledge does not target individuals based on their identity, but rather boycotts “complicit Israeli film institutions and companies”.“We sincerely hope that Paramount, in its statement today, isn’t intentionally misrepresenting the pledge in an attempt to silence our colleagues in the film industry,” the organization added. “Such a move would only shield a genocidal regime from criticism at a time when global outrage is exponentially growing and while meaningful steps towards accountability are being taken by many.”Warners Bros Discovery’s rejection of the boycott comes after Varietyreportedthat the group UK Lawyers for Israel sent a legal letter to the UK offices of Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros Discovery and others warning that such a pledge would violate the country’s 2010 Equality Act, making it “highly likely to be a litigation risk”.Separately, 1,200 entertainment figures, including Liev Schreiber, Debra Messing and Mayim Bialik,signedan open letter rejecting the boycott as a “document of misinformation” from artists “misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda”.Last week, Israel and Hamas agreed to theinitial phase of a ceasefire, pausing two years of violence in which Israel destroyed more than 90% of homes in Gaza and killed more than 67,000 Palestinians in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,139 people and taking another 240 hostage. On Monday, Hamas released the remaining 20 living hostages in Gaza as part of a swap in which Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees, while world leaders met in hopes of maintaining a fragile peace.Explore more on these topicsWarner BrosIsraelPalestineGazanewsShareReuse this content"

That’s our Trinidadian maritime law and I think every fisherman and every human knows that,” she said.Burnley said her son was planning to return toTrinidad and Tobagoafter spending three months with family in Venezuela, just 6.8 miles (11km) away.Joseph’s grandmother Christine Clement also rejected claims of trafficking, calling the attack “wickedness”.At least 27 people have been killed so far in such attacks off the coast of Venezuela, which theTrump administrationsays are necessary to protect the United States from narcotics smuggled from Venezuela.Last month, fishers in Las Cuevastold the Guardianthat they were afraid of being caught in the crossfire amid Trump’s “war on drugs” in the region. Instead of their usual route, heading west toward Venezuela, fishers said they now head east, staying close to the coast of Trinidad.The Washington Post reported on Thursday that the US had since expanded its mission with elite special operations aviation unit helicopters conducting training exercises in the region.Trinidadian fishers fear getting caught in the crossfire amid Trump’s Caribbean ‘war on drugs’Read moreTrinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, had previously expressed strong support for a US strike on a Venezuela-based drug vessel,telling local journalistsshe had “no sympathy for traffickers” and that the US military should “kill them all violently”. She added that the military mission would reduce violence in the region and asked for divine protection for US personnel involved in the mission.But other Caribbean leaders have described theUS militaryactivity as a threat to the peace and security in the region.Antigua and Barbuda’s prime minister, Gaston Browne,made it clearthat his country had no interest in hosting foreign military installations, after Grenada’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed it was carefully reviewing a request from the US for the “temporary installation of radar equipment and associated technical personnel”.In response to US military buildup in the region,Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s president, ordered large-scale military exercises on Wednesday and said he wasmobilizing the military, police and a civilian militiato defend his country.Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoUS militaryTrump administrationDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroVenezuelaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A church service at Oslo Cathedral was scheduled to follow his apology.The apology took place at the London Pub, one of two bars targeted in the2022 shootingthat killed two people and left nine seriously injured during Oslo’s Pride celebrations. A Norwegian of Iranian origin, who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for the killings.Like many religions around the world, the Church of Norway – an evangelical Lutheran church that is Norway’s largest faith community – had long marginalised LGBTQ+ people, refusing to allow them to become pastors or to marry in church. In the 1950s, the church’s bishopsdescribed gay peopleas a “social danger of global proportions”.View image in fullscreenOlav Fykse Tveit in the London Pub, Oslo, where he gave his speech of apology.Photograph: Javad Parsa/ReutersBut as Norwegian society became increasingly liberal, becoming the second in the world to allow same-sex registered partnerships in 1993 and in 2009 the first Scandinavian country to allow same-sex marriage, the church slowly followed.In 2007, the Church of Norway began ordaining gay pastors, and same-sex couples have been able tomarry in churchsince 2017. In 2023, Tveit participated in Oslo’s Pride parade in what was described as a first for the church.Thursday’s apology was met with a mixed reaction. The head of a network of Christian lesbians in Norway, Hanne Marie Pedersen-Eriksen, herself a gay pastor, described it as “an important reparation” and a moment that “finally marked the end of a dark chapter in the church’s history”.For Stephen Adom, the head of Norway’s Association for Gender and Sexual Diversity, the apology was “strong and important” but had come “too late for those among us who died of Aids … with hearts filled with anguish because the church considered the epidemic to be God’s punishment”.Globally, a handful of religious institutions have sought to make amends for their actions towards LGBTQ+ people. In 2023, the Church of England apologisedfor what it describedas its “shameful” treatment, though itcontinues to refuseto allow same-sex marriages in church.Similarly, the Methodist Church in Ireland last yearapologisedfor its “failures in pastoral support and care” to LGBTQ+ people and their families, but remained staunch in its belief that marriage could only be a union between a man and a woman.Earlier this year, the United Church of Canada offered an apology to two spirit and LGBTQIA+ communities, describing it as a reaffirmation of the church’s “commitment to radical hospitality and full inclusion” in all aspects of church life.“We have failed to celebrate and delight in all of your beautiful creation,” Rev Michael Blair, thegeneral secretary of the church, said. “We have wounded people instead of seeking wholeness. We are sorry.”With contributions from Agence France-Presse and ReutersExplore more on these topicsLGBTQ+ rightsReligionNorwayChristianityEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Western Alliance also said it was dealing with a fraudulent borrower.Zions stock was down over 11% by Thursday afternoon, while Western Alliance was down over 10%. Shares of Jefferies Financial Group were down 9% for the day.The sell-off knocked the wider market, with the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.7% and the Dow Jones down 0.6% in New York.The regional banking industry has been under scrutiny after First Brands, an auto parts supplier,filedfor chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September over creditor concerns.First Brands: why a maker of spark plugs and wiper blades has Wall Street worriedRead moreIn its bankruptcy filing, First Brands disclosed that it had at least $10bn to $50bn in liabilities against $1bn to $10bn in assets, the product of what appeared to be risky off-balance-sheet financing.Amid the bankruptcy, First Brands’ creditors filed an emergency court filing saying that $2.3bn of the company’s assets had “simply vanished”.Prosecutors at the justice department said they wereinvestigatingthe bankruptcy, and regional banks have faced intense scrutiny in light of what some worry were questionable lending practices.Jefferies, a regional bank, and UBS said they had hundreds of millions of dollars in exposure to First Brands. Shares in Jefferies have fallen 25% over the past month.In the aftermath, some experts have pointed out the bankruptcy shows cracks in the system that allows for “shadow banking” – when a borrower turns to private services outside the traditional banking system to get financing. In the case with First Brands, the company gave lenders unpaid invoices as a form of collateral.On a call with analysts on Tuesday, JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon,saidhis “antenna goes up when things like that happen”.“I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” he said. “Everyone should be forewarned on this.”Explore more on these topicsBankingBankruptcy and IVAsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Rahman was found not only to have used AI to prepare his work, but “failed thereafter to undertake any proper checks on the accuracy”.The upper tribunal judge Mark Blundell said Rahman had even tried to hide the fact he had used AI and “wasted” the tribunal’s time. Blundell said he was considering reporting Rahman to the Bar Standards Board. The Guardian has contacted Rahman’s firm for comment.The matter came to light in the case of two Honduran sisters who claimed asylum on the basis that they were being targeted by a criminal gang in their home country. Rahman represented the sisters, aged 29 and 35. The case escalated to the upper tribunal.Blundell rejected Rahman’s arguments, adding that “nothing said by Mr Rahman orally or in writing establishes an error of law on the part of the judge and the appeal must be dismissed”.Then, in a rare ruling, Blundell went on to say in a postscript that there were “significant problems” within the grounds of appeal put before him.He said that 12 authorities were cited in the paperwork by Rahman, but when he came to read the grounds, he noticed that “some of those authorities did not exist and that others did not support the propositions of law for which they were cited in the grounds”.In his judgment, he listed 10 of these cases and set out “what was said by Mr Rahman about those actual or fictitious cases”.Blundell said: “Mr Rahman appeared to know nothing about any of the authorities he had cited in the grounds of appeal he had supposedly settled in July this year. He had apparently not intended to take me to any of those decisions in his submissions.“Some of the decisions did not exist. Not one decision supported the proposition of law set out in the grounds.”Blundell said the submissions made by Rahman – who said he had used “various websites” to conduct his research – were therefore misleading.Blundell said: “The most obvious explanation is … that the grounds of appeal were drafted in whole or in part by generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT.“I am bound to observe that one of the cases cited in Mr Rahman’s grounds … has recently been wrongly deployed by ChatGPT in support of similar arguments.”Rahman told the judge that the inaccuracies in the grounds were “as a result of his drafting style” and he accepted there might have been some “confusion and vagueness” in his submissions.Blundell said: “The problems which I have detailed above are not matters of drafting style. The authorities which were cited in the grounds either did not exist or did not support the grounds of which were advanced.”He added: “It is overwhelmingly likely, in my judgment, that Mr Rahman used generative artificial intelligence to formulate the grounds of appeal in this case, and that he attempted to hide that fact from me during the hearing.“Even if Mr Rahman thought, for whatever reason, that these cases did somehow support the arguments he wished to make, he cannot explain the entirely fictitious citations.“In my judgment, the only realistic possibility is that Mr Rahman relied significantly on Gen AI to formulate the grounds and sought to disguise that fact when the difficulties were explored with him at the hearing.”The judge’s ruling was made in September and published on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingJudiciarynewsShareReuse this content"

I probably shouldn’t say this but when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more. And so everyone should be forewarned at this point,” Dimon said.JP Morgan boss says more ‘cockroaches’ will emerge after private credit sector failuresRead moreGeorgieva said the IMF was being “very watchful”, but argued that “so far, not that many cockroaches” had been spotted.She said she was encouraged that countries across the globe had better policy frameworks than were in place before the global financial crisis of 2008, while “systemically significant economies” had accumulated massive reserves to cope with problems.But, she cautioned that many countries had exhausted their fiscal buffers, meaning they had little budget headroom to handle a financial crisis, while central banks were still battling inflation, and she urged vigilance over the non-bank sector.“In this environment, of course, the security blanket is covering us, but maybe we have a foot out in the cold. We have to be vigilant. What do we do? We watch it very carefully,” Georgieva said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Clifford plays haughty but troubled aristocrat Lady Isabella who welcomes a young film-maker into her gorgeous country estate (filmed at Somerleyton Hall in Suffolk) with calamitous results, and the film plays like a scuzzier, shroomier B-side to Saltburn. Maybe it’s a bit reliant on Clifford’s overwhelming firepower of performance, and we have to indulge the way it cheats strict mockumentary rules about how exactly the camera comes to be where it is at every moment. But there are laughs and unexpected tenderness in this very peculiar sentimental education.Laurie Kynaston plays Sam, a pushy, insecure young director who shows up at the stately home with his crew, excited at the prospect of shooting a candid documentary study, but disconcerted by the distrait behaviour and patrician mannerisms of the chatelaine, Lady Isabella. Describing herself as “aristocracy’s answer to the Kardashians”, she hosts and judges the annual talent show Stately Stars for local children. Yearning for her own artistic vocation to be respected, Lady Isabella now wishes to compete against the youngsters herself, with a vast, complex multimedia performance-installation piece which includes poetry, action painting and photographs of her apparently dead body around the grounds. Juliet Cowan is a put-upon housekeeper who is unsure whether to address her employer as “milady”.With the gloating cruelty of a born documentarian, Sam is secretly thrilled at this extraordinary story which has fallen into his lap; he can use her for a blend of Sunset Boulevard and Grey Gardens. For her part, and with a predatory cunning to match his, Lady Isabella picks up on Sam’s own anxieties and sexual inexperience, although sometimes she misjudges the mood. She sensually drinks a huge glass of milk in front of him, but Sam’s dairy intolerance means he has to run out to be sick; Lady Isabella shouts petulantly after him: “Since when is milk not sexy?”What complicates the whole situation is Lady Isabella’s own central complaint: as both a woman and an artist, she isn’t being seen. Perimenopause makes her invisible and she hasn’t had the artistic recognition that she regards as another of the many things to which she is entitled. As she angrily says to Sam during one of their tiffs, she is not self-obsessed, she is self-centred, because an artist explores and develops the self. There is of course something Brent-Partridgean about Isabella’s delusions, and yet gender takes it away from this template; the film’s poignancy and magic realist meltdowns give Lady Isabella her own exotic charm.Lady screened at theLondon film festival.Explore more on these topicsLondon film festival 2025Comedy filmsFleabagComedyLondon film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

With a vibe that has more in common with an Alpine spa hotel than the poky rooms and grim corridors usually associated with housing for elderly people, the building – by architects Witherford Watson Mann – reinvents the almshouse for the modern era as a place of care, shelter and social connection.As a building type, the origins of almshouses extend back centuries, giving a semblance of dignity to the poor, the old, the sick and the marginalised. Sequestered from the outside world, with cellular dwellings arrayed around courtyards, they evoke a sense of pastoral benevolence.View image in fullscreenA sense of pastoral benevolence … the central courtyard.Photograph: Philip VileFor Witherford Watson Mann, the challenge was not only how to rethink the traditional almshouse form, but also how to look beyond the simple provision of housing, to conceive of it as the heart of a hosting network, a set of rooms to be shared with like-minded local organisations. The client, United St Saviour’s, a charity based in Southwark, London, is also a grant-making trust, supporting refugee groups and youth centres, as well as cultural organisations. The aim is that these will make use of the building’s communal spaces, so it feels like an integral part of local life, rather than some kind of secluded retirement enclave.Set in Bermondsey, in south-east London, among Victorian terraces and postwar blocks, Appleby Blue is on a site previously occupied by a disused care home. Its intended clientele are those over 65 who meet the charity’s definition of being in financial need and who have lived in the local borough of Southwark for more than three years. The scheme’s 57 bright, spacious flats for single people and couples are arranged around a central courtyard filled with shimmering ginkgo trees and tinkling pools.Appleby is a doughty, five storey block of mottled brown and blue brick with pale oak window frames expressively counterpointing the dark masonry. To the rear, deferring to the scale of the Victorian terraces, it steps down to a smaller, two storey volume topped with a roof garden populated with raised beds and sitting nooks. Dedicated to cultivating produce for use in the almshouse kitchen, it is maintained by a local gardening group, with residents also making horticultural contributions.View image in fullscreenDesigned for gossiping … the ‘civic room’.Photograph: Philip VileAt the building’s heart overlooking the ginkgo tree courtyard, is the double height garden room, designed to host an array of activities. Beyond the daily routines of eating, drinking, gossiping and watching the world go by, these might include coffee mornings, film nights, dance classes, markets, music performances, plays and making workshops.The human theatre of this “civic room” can be seen from the street through a timber and glass walkway that projects out along the main facade, like a huge shop window. “The idea was to build right in the heart of the community, in a busy place, with a very direct relationship to the high street, not to hide people away,” says project architect Stephen Witherford.A key move was to get rid of claustrophobic and disorienting internal corridors. Instead, access to individual flats is through glazed galleries that wrap around the south side of the main block. Furnished with robust oak benches, quarry tiled floors and planting boxes, the galleries act as informal inside-outside spaces in which to sit contemplatively or natter with neighbours, while savouring views of the Victorian terrace gardens and the hills of suburban London beyond. In warmer weather, the galleries can be opened up through large sliding screens.In its architecture and operation, Appleby Blue is a consciously extrovert presence and a retort to the prevalent notion that older people (especially poorer older people) should be shunted to the urban and sociocultural margins, with adverse consequences for their mental and physical health. By reimagining later living as a collective experience, it draws its residents together in a building that elevates the everyday.View image in fullscreenCultivating produce for the kitchen … the rooftop gardens.Photograph: Philip VileOn behalf of the Stirling prize jury, Ingrid Schroder, director of the Architectural Association School ofArchitecture, said: “Designing social housing for later life is too often reduced to a simple provision of service. Appleby Blue, however, is a provision of pure delight. Its architects have crafted high-quality spaces that are generous and thoughtful, blending function and community to create environments that truly care for their residents.”For all its admirable intentions, Appleby Blue is still a drop in a vast ocean of need. But in suggesting different ways of doing things, it does constitute an exemplar that has the potential to be replicated. And though it’s not all “rainbows and unicorns”, as Witherford admits, the residents take evident pleasure in their surroundings and relish being part of the almshouse community.Seeing off competition from larger, more “statement” projects – including the restoration of the Palace of Westminster’sElizabeth Tower– this is Witherford Watson Mann’s second Stirling prize. In 2013 the practice won for its imaginative remodelling of the ruined Apsley Castle in Warwickshire for the Landmark Trust. Restoring a fire ravaged stately home and designing social housing for older people might seem worlds apart yet both are underscored by a thoughtful sensitivity to context and the impetus to transform and transcend.Explore more on these topicsStirling prizeAwards and prizesArchitectureArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Larry David did it. So did Andrew Ridgeley. Now this witty and heartbreakingly sad chamber piece from screenwriter Robert Kaplow and directorRichard Linklatertells the all but unbearable story of Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart just after his split from Richard Rodgers. He is played with campy brilliance, an unspeakable combover and fake smallness by Ethan Hawke, who is often digitally reduced in size – but is also occasionally filmed standing in an off-camera hole to look up poignantly at taller characters, facing Hart’s vertical challenge as José Ferrer once played the diminutive Toulouse-Lautrec.Hawke gets big, world-weary laughs with Hart’s riffs on the hidden gayness of the movie Casablanca and the cheesily upbeat musical he’s just been to see, with all the lasso-twirling cowboys; he acidly calls it Okla-homo. The sexual identity of Hart is complex: this film effectively triangulates his gayness with the straight persona invented for him in the 1948 musical Words and Music (with Mickey Rooney playing Hart); it cleverly extrapolates a kind of bisexuality from Hart’s letters to his protege: young Yale student and would-be stage designer Elizabeth Weiland, played here with heedless girlishness byMargaret Qualley.As part of the legendaryBroadwaysongwriting team with composer Rodgers, Hart was responsible for matchless numbers like The Lady Is a Tramp, Manhattan, My Funny Valentine and of course Blue Moon. But exasperated with Hart’s alcoholism, unreliability and depressive outbursts, Rodgers broke with him and partnered with Oscar Hammerstein II to write Oklahoma! and then a raft of stage and screen smashes. The movie imagines the deeply depressed Hart in Oklahoma!’s first-night New York audience in 1943, looking on with envious despair as the show proceeds, despising its bland sentimentality, hating the exclamation mark at the end of the title, but heartsinkingly aware of how lethally effective it is. He knows a hit when he sees one – and feels himself descending into failure.Even before the interval, Hart miserably ducks out and heads to the bar at Sardi’s where the rest of the film takes place, and waits for the (inevitably) triumphant Oklahoma! company to show up for their after-party. He knows it is his showbiz duty to congratulate Rodgers, to pretend everything is all right. With suave restraint,Andrew Scottplays Rodgers, clearly embarrassed at what they both know is Hart’s humiliation; he offers a sop to his pride in the form of a short-term gig writing new numbers for their existing show A Connecticut Yankee, which only makes it worse.Bobby Cannavale plays the barman who in traditional style listens sympathetically to Hart’s arias of vinegary despair; Patrick Kennedy plays EB White, to whom Hart accidentally gives the idea for his children’s book Stuart Little; and Qualley plays Weiland, the unattainably beautiful Yale student with whom the film imagines Hart to be complicatedly and self-harmingly in love. Hart has already been jilted by Rodgers. Surely the universe can’t be so cruel as to get him jilted by Weiland as well? But Qualley ruthlessly portrays a young woman who wants Hart to be the giggly, sexually unthreatening intimate to whom she can confide her adventures with boys – as well of course the Broadway power broker who can further her career.Hawke shows that Hart partly takes voyeuristic pleasure in hearing about these boys but he is also genuinely, tragically besotted with Weiland and the movie tells us about something rarely touched on in films about the world of musical theatre or the movies: the terrible overlap between professional and romantic failure. Yet at some level, Hart is defiantly aware that what he has achieved will survive. It’s a terrific performance from Hawke. This could be a stage musical – but who will write the songs?Blue Moon screened at the London film festival; it is out on 17 October in the US, 14 November in the UK and on 29 January in Australia.Explore more on these topicsLondon film festival 2025Drama filmsRichard LinklaterEthan HawkeMargaret QualleyAndrew ScottMusicals (Stage)reviewsShareReuse this content"

With its 1970s small-town setting, high school cast, psychic kids and gnarly neighbourhood villain, it was close to pastiche and, like the very worst of King’s stories, it was also inelegantly overstuffed.Funnily enough the call came from inside the family home, as it was based on a short story from King’s son Joe Hill, over-extended into a film that was a surprise $161m hit. It was the story of the Grabber, a sadistic killer of young boys who would revel in elongating the ritual of their deaths. While sexual abuse was never mentioned, there was something inescapably queer-coded about the character and the historical touchpoints/moral panics he was clearly supposed to refer to, reinforced byEthan Hawkeplaying him with a certain swishy, effeminate flare (even before his appearance, the word fag had also been liberally used). But the film was too opaque to ever really admit that and even without that uneasiness, it was too busily plotted and too high on its exhaustingly grubby nastiness to work as anything more than an undiscerning sleepover nightmare fuel.Ballad of a Small Player review – Colin Farrell seeks redemption in Edward Berger’s high-stakes gambling yarnRead moreIts sequel arrives as former horror hit-makers Blumhouse are in desperate need of a win. This year they have struggled to make anything work, from Wolf Man to The Woman in the Yard to Drop to the total box office disaster of M3gan 2.0, and so a great deal rides on whether Black Phone 2 can prove whether a short story can become a movie that can spawn a franchise. There’s just one slight problem …The first film ended with our Final Boy Finn (Mason Thames) killing the Grabber, assisted and trained by the ghosts of those he had killed before (andhis psychic sister helping to track down his location – see, busy!). It’s forced writer-director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer C Robert Cargill to take the series and its killer to a new place, turning a flesh and blood villain into a supernatural one, a route that takes them via Elm Street with an ability to cross back into the real world facilitated by dreams. But unlike Freddy Krueger, the Grabber is markedly uninventive and entirely devoid of humour (this time Hawke also plays him without any of the same camp-ness, perhaps reading the room a little …). The mask remains effectively jarring but the film struggles to make him as frightening as he briefly was in the first, trapped by convoluted and often confusing rules.Finn and his annoyingly foul-mouthed sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw) encounter him again while snowed in at an alpine Christian camp for kids, the sequel also nodding toward Freddy’s one-time nemesis Jason Voorhees (both would make mincemeat of the Grabber). Gwen is guided there by a vision of her late mother and what might be their late tormenter’s first victims while Finn, still trying to process his anger and newfound ability to fight back, is following so he can protect her. The script is too ungainly in its contrived scene-setting, clumsily needing to get the siblings stranded at a place that will also add to backstories for both protagonist and antagonist, filling in details we didn’t really need or want to know about (as a mystery, it’s not all that interesting). In what also feels like a more calculated move to edge the film toward the same church-attending crowds that turned the Conjuring franchise into massive hits, Derrickson adds a religious element, with good now more closely associated with God and heaven while bad represents the devil and hell, faith the ultimate weapon against a monster like this.What all of this does is further over-stack a series that was already close to toppling over, adding unnecessary complications to what should be a simple Friday night engine (I often found myself too busy asking questions about the the hows and whys of what could or couldn’t happen to feel all that involved). It’s a low-lift effort for Hawke, whose face we never really see (it could, for all we know as viewers, be purely voice work) but he does have genuine presence that’s mostly missing elsewhere in the cast. The setting is at times atmospherically grand but the majority of the consistently un-scary set pieces are marred by a grainy 8mm texture to differentiate asleep and awake, an ineffective stylistic choice that feels too self-aware and constructed to mirror the horrifying unpredictability of being in an actual nightmare.At just under two hours, Black Phone 2, like M3gan 2.0 before it, is a needlessly long and hugely unconvincing argument for the birth of a new franchise. The next time it rings, I recommend not answering.Black Phone 2 is out in Australian cinemas on 16 October and in the US and UK on 17 OctoberExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsEthan HawkereviewsShareReuse this content"

The performances are excellent, the action is tense and the script is highly eruditeHannah J DaviesThu 16 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 00.04 EDTShareOver two high-stakes seasons, this drama about a US ambassador to the UK who finds herself moonlighting for the president and the entire state department has proved itself to be a rare beast: a political thriller that is frequently excellent, often erudite (a character once referred to another as “the Hecate of Highgate” instead of just calling her a stirrer), but which also requires the total and utter suspension of your disbelief. Question any of it for a second – as I did in the final episode of this third series, when the new US president asks the prime minister whether Chequers is his family’s ancestral seat – and it begins to crumble. But if you file it firmly within the category of spicy geopolitical soap? Boy oh boy, is it good.We pick up where season two left off, and the aftermath of a car bomb that badly injured Kate’s (Keri Russell) on/off husband, Hal (Rufus Sewell). Meanwhile, British PM Nicol Trowbridge (Rory Kinnear) is still apoplectic about the actions of Tory fixer Margaret Roylin (Celia Imrie), who proved to be not only an irritant with a direct line to the Daily Mail, but the mastermind of a false-flag operation that implicated Russia. Of course, what our canny diplomat Kate knows is that Roylin was acting on behalf of someone even more influential: US vice-president Grace Penn (Allison Janney), whose job Kate was eyeing up last season. Everyone has more pressing concerns, however: when he found out the truth about Penn, President Rayburn carked it in the final moments of season two, leaving Penn to step up and creating a vacancy for VP. Surely Kate is a shoo-in as Penn’s deputy, especially with this much collateral on her?View image in fullscreenCelia Imrie as Margaret Roylin in The Diplomat.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixOf course, with there being eight episodes to fill, Kate does not simply pack up her large collection of trouser suits and leg it to the White House to get down to some paperwork. Not least because Penn doesn’t choose her for VP – she picks noted manchild Hal instead. He takes the role but insists he’ll find something for Kate to do; rather than suggesting something in the vein of, say, Melania Trump’s Be Best anti-bullying campaign, he decides maybe she can lead on the reconstruction of Ukraine or maybe pull up a chair with Nato.What follows is an increasingly ludicrous tale, as Kate attempts to hang on to her ambassador role while also dropping into DC now and again for second lady duty. I suppose there isn’t really a show called The Diplomat if the lead character isn’t a diplomat any more, but it is so stressful watching her pinball between the two countries, standing up the director of the CIA because she’s forgotten to check Google Calendar. The whole thing is – as put-upon White House chief of staff Billie Appiah (Nana Mensah) puts it – “a cockamamie arrangement”, though you may prefer stronger terms. Kate does, at least, bag a boyfriend along the way, played by Poldark’s Aidan Turner, who says things like “in a day or so, [Hal’s] going to go back to Washington, and I’m going to take all your clothes off”. It isn’t the sexiest dialogue ever but saves on limited time, due to all of the above and a new military threat.View image in fullscreen‘Keri Russell does defeated, stressed and angry all at once again with mastery’ …Photograph: NetflixThere are, I’m glad to report, some excellent performances, not least from West Wing alums Janney and Bradley Whitford, who reconnect here with each other and with showrunner Debora Cahn. They are reunited as Penn and her husband, Todd, an “increasingly insignificant househusband married to a supernova” who stifles all of his frustration beneath a rictus grin, à la Succession’s Connor Roy. Keri Russell does defeated, stressed and angry all at once again with mastery, especially when she’s telling her lookalike decoy to buy a hairbrush. I struggle to care too much about the ongoing will they/won’t they dynamic between Kate’s right-hand man Stuart (Ato Essandoh) and CIA chief Eidra Park (Ali Ahn), but I am still glad to see them all there, like old friends (albeit the sort of friends who talk solely about political conspiracies and whether or not they should kiss). We also learn more about Kate and Hal’s marriage, and the ebb and flow of power between these two that helps to contextualise flippant lines from earlier in the series, like the time Kate absent-mindedly mentioned her other half had once been kidnapped by Hezbollah.The final two episodes see us hurtle towards a startlingly similar conclusion to last season, and there are moments where it begins to drag. But, on the whole, The Diplomat remains a treat. Keep that disbelief close, and it will feel more like a comedy in places. But keep it at bay, and – much like our own real-world politics – it is a nail-biter.The Diplomat is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, he’s been consistently admired for his warm tone, effortless musical line and theatrical originality. His debut recital album continues that trend, but don’t expect the usual lineup of Handel arias or Dowland lute songs. On Refound, a collection of art songs with reinvention at its heart, his choices are eclectic, idiosyncratic even, but also profoundly satisfying.View image in fullscreenRefound by Hugh Cutting album artwork.Photograph: LinnConnections and parallels abound. Ravel’s reworkings of Greek folk song pair with Vaughan Williams’ Linden Lea, Dvořák’s Biblical Songs mirror Howells’ medieval carol setting, Come Sing and Dance. It’s Cutting’s plush yet flexible voice, however, that ties it all together. His handling of text, a willingness to go deep, and an impeccable musical sensitivity illuminate each song, from Piers Connor Kennedy’s wartime reflections to Tom Lehrer’s Poisoning Pigeons in the Park (sung here as a baritone).Audrey Hyland is a worthy partner throughout, whether cushioning the vocal line in French Melodies by Hahn and Bonis or bringing drama to Lieder by Wolf. Ending with the spoken word – a Schubert rarity for reciter and piano – is a surprise, but if Cutting has taught us anything by this point, it is to expect the unexpected.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Not wanting to sound big-headed, but this was not the case for me. The early success, especially of tunes such as Going Out of My Head and Everybody Needs a 303, had crystalised in my mind where all of this was going. I knew what was turning people on and had kinda cracked the formula of how the next album should sound. The formula was: breakbeats from my love of hip-hop, the anarchic rebellion of punk, the energy of acid house and hooks from the pop music I grew up on. I had all the thrift store samples built into a library for audio collage, and a club to test out new tunes.This new movement in music so far had no name to pigeonhole it. We, and journalists, tried various options such as tripno, Brit hop, and amyl house, but the name that it landed with came from my club – the Big Beat Boutique. We felt an enormous collective pride in that. House music was named after the Warehouse Club in Chicago, garage music was named after the Paradise Garage in New York, and now big beat was named after our night at a little scout hut in Brighton.Our style of music was crossing over to the mainstream, which tickled me no end. Someone wrote: “Fatboy makes dance music for people who don’t like dance music.” I took it as a huge compliment. The Prodigy, the Chemical Brothers, Basement Jaxx and Groove Armada were converting the rock and indie kids into rave monkeys, and it felt good. The dancefloor was for all.The recording of my second album, You’ve Come a Long Way, Baby, was quick and almost effortless. In one week alone I wrote Praise You, Right Here, Right Now and Fucking in Heaven.The album was released in October 1998, and thankfully was met with excellent reviews and outrageous sales. We knew it was good, and that there was momentum and excitement in the air, but we had no concept of how far it was going: a decade after appearing in the Housemartins, I was about to be a pop star again! With success comes celebrity, not something I had experienced before to this extent, and not something that sat well with me. But with a tumbler of vodka in my hand I ploughed my way through.A knock-on effect of the rise in popularity was that gigs were starting to get bigger. As well as nightclubs, I was now playing bigger venues and being invited to play some of the festivals. A lot of those gigs had not been done by DJs before, only bands and singers. Large stages looked a bit sparse with one bloke, a table and a couple of record players where normally a band’s expansive backline would be. I had to follow Foo Fighters at T in the Park one time, and they had put on a balls-out rock’n’roll show, which had the crowd super hyped. When all their equipment was rolled off, the 30ft walk to my table seemed an awfully long way. Before starting on it, Garry [Blackburn, manager] had asked: “How are you gonna follow that?” Somewhere along that walk I morphed into Captain Showboat, a kind of cross between Mick Jagger and Liberace. The crowd lapped it up, and my stage persona was born.It Ain’t Over… ’Til the Fatboy Sings by Norman Cook, published by Rocket 88, isout now.Right here, right now: images from It Ain’t Over… ’Til the Fatboy SingsBrighton beach shows (main image)In 2002, over 250,000 people descended on Brighton for the second Big Beach Boutique, a freeFatboy Slimshow that shut down the city.

Along with witchcraft and necromancy, Hekate is also associated with boundaries and crossroads, acting as protector and guide to lost travellers. In art, she is commonly depicted holding torches to show the way, and accompanied by a black dog or serpent.In Hekate the Witch, the poet Nikita Gill reimagines the life of this enigmatic goddess in verse. Born during a war between the old Titan rulers and new Gods of Olympia, Hekate is birthed alone by her Titan mother, Asteria, who tells her she is destined for greatness. The pair live alone in a dilapidated palace but are forced to flee when Zeus and Poseidon come to enslave them. Seeking refuge in the Underworld, Asteria is denied entry but Hekate, still a Godling, is admitted and taken into the care of Styx and Hades. There, she briefly meets her father, Perses, chained to a mountain after the Titan defeat, who predicts a future for his daughter in which “the dead will bow to you as you move in their wake”.Gill, who specialises in women-centric retellings of Greek and Hindu myths, is our propulsive and charismatic narrator. She depicts Hekate less as a sinister deity than a traumatised youngster looking for love and a sense of belonging, and whose divine powers alarm the Gods of Olympus. “The sound that swelled from their halls around my name was not laughter,” Hekate reflects. “But hushed whispers of fear.”Available via Simon & Schuster Audio, 6hr 9minFurther listeningI Want to Go Home But I’m Already ThereRóisín Lanigan, Penguin Audio, 8hr 53minRuby Campbell narrates this tale of a young couple, Áine and Elliot, who move into an affluent city neighbourhood full of bakeries and yoga studios.

Still releasing potent high-octane riffage, they retread their path through cancer scares and jazz detoursThu 16 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 11.49 EDTShareIn the Bay Area of mid-1980s California, a heavy metal scene was forming that was angrier, louder and much, much faster than anything that came before: thrash. Progenitors Metallica are the most well-known of its alumni, but this corner of the West Coast spawned dozens of other brilliant bands seemingly unbounded by tempo, or sometimes even melody.With their blistering, high-octane riffing and superb technical chops, one of the most formidable and resilient is Testament. Despite having enough lineup changes to rival the Fall, cancer scares and the 1990s grunge takeover that edged out cut-off denim for plaid shirts, Testament are still selling out tours, gnashing at the heels of the commercially dominating Big Four metal bands – Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax – and releasing new records with just as much vigour. The most recent, Para Bellum, came out last week.It all started in late 1983 when, fresh from high school, Eric Peterson and cousin Derrick Ramirez from Alameda near Oakland, formed Testament’s precursor, Legacy. The two guitarists played their first show above a record store with local punks Rebels and Infidels, but their next – while clad in priest collars – was supporting Slayer. “That was our first taste of a sold-out crowd,” says Peterson, as the band dial in from their homes across the US. “We were so nervous. We only had four songs.”Ramirez soon quit, so Peterson recruited local Berkeley teenager Alex Skolnick – one of the most accomplished guitarists in metal, who studied under the virtuoso Joe Satriani. “I was into Ozzy and Dio,” says Skolnick. “Eric told me: we have to speed it up!”Completing the lineup was Louie Clemente on drums, bassist Greg Christian and Steve “Zetro” Souza on vocals. They’d go drinking together at the epicentre of the Bay Area thrash underground, Ruthie’s Inn; Peterson and Skolnick would “have a couple kamikazes [cocktails], plough our way through the crowd and just pummel people,” says Peterson of the pair’s boisterous moshpit demeanour. “They wouldn’t know what happened – that was kind of the vibe.”Souza quit to join fellow thrashers Exodus, leaving a gap for a frontman. The band knew a kid called Chuck Billy, known to Peterson and Clemente as The Cheese for his ever-present grin, who they’d occasionally spot hovering by beer kegs at parties. “He was very quiet but had a kind of sinister laugh,” says Peterson.The problem was that Billy fronted a hard-rocking glam band called Guilt: the kind of music that thrash metal fans poured scorn on, and sometimes worse. “You had to fit in: if you came from a glam band, and you went in [Ruthie’s Inn] – especially at Exodus shows – I think you got beaten up,” Peterson says. But when Billy decided to audition for Testament, Peterson and Clemente checked out a Guilt gig in San Francisco. “The guys had their Paul Stanley hair, doing their cute moves,” says Peterson. “Then Chuck came out wearing a trench coat and started breaking beer bottles over his head. He looked glam, but he had this presence.”View image in fullscreen‘Forget trying to float a melody’ … Testament in 1988.Photograph: Gene AmboBilly got the job, and thus began his glam deprogramming. Out with the spandex – a decision Billy says he was “happy for, believe me, being a big guy” – and in with Reebok hi-tops. Eric coached Billy into learning how to snarl along with the frenetic, bouncing-ball pace of thrash. “Forget trying to float a melody,” says Billy. “You have to keep up the pace.”By 1986, thrash metal was peaking. It was the year of Slayer’s furious 29-minute stormer Reign in Blood, Metallica’s Master of Puppets and Megadeth’s Peace Sells… But Who’s Buying? Somehow, the riffs got faster yet more complex, technical mastery mixed in with the breakneck speed. And it was the year Testament auditioned for Megaforce, the influential label that released Metallica’s first records. But the night that label owners Jon and Marsha were in town, Metallica’s wildly inventive bassist Cliff Burton, then only 24, was killed in a tour bus crash.“Our audition the next day was very sombre,” says Billy. “Here we were about to have the biggest performance of our lives in this unusual situation.” But Megaforce signed, the band changed their name to Testament and, in 1987, released debut album The Legacy to acclaim. Crammed into a van, the band toured extensively, supporting all the thrash mainstays – except Metallica, with Billy wondering if this is because Peterson married their guitarist Kirk Hammett’s ex – then climbing to top billing themselves.But with constant touring and the pressures of recording a new album each year, this hectic schedule eventually frayed relations. “Five records in a row, this pressure-cooker environment,” says Skolnick. “We were very young. I was a teen on that first record. After back-to-back recording and touring, we needed some rest and a long break, which we never had.”By now it was 1992 and grunge had swept in, hitting pause on thrash metal’s mainstream moment. Newly on Atlantic, Testament were under pressure to release something radio-friendly, which resulted in their next record The Ritual. Now a fan favourite, it was such a departure at the time that Testament refused to play its songs live. The frazzled Skolnick left to pursue jazz, later enrolling at the New School of Jazz and Contemporary Music (his other combo, the Alex Skolnick Trio, has a new record out too). “Louie and Greg were horrified,” Peterson says. “Me and Chuck were like, ‘OK’. The first thing I thought was: we can get heavy [again].”But a “scuff” led to Clemente quitting while on the road, leaving Testament without a drummer at a sold-out final show on Skolnick’s farewell tour. “We were inviting people from the crowd,” says Peterson. “Chuck was like: does anybody know this song? People are jumping up and giving it a go. It was a weird night, man.”View image in fullscreenChuck Billy performing in 2015.Photograph: Mark Horton/Getty ImagesTestament continued in one form or another, recruiting other acclaimed and storied musicians such as Slayer’s Dave Lombardo; they down-tuned their instruments and got even heavier, with Billy perfecting his death-metal growl on 1999’s The Gathering. But in 2001, Billy was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, with a large tumour lodged in his chest.While undergoing treatment, Billy – who was raised Catholic but whose father was Native American Pomo – reconnected with his Indigenous roots. Along with chemotherapy, he contacted Native healers and medicine men with whom he shared mysterious spiritual experiences involving wolf dens, chanting, eagle feathers and astral travel, and who he credits with helping him to fully recover.A 2005 tour with the classic lineup reunited the band, where one gig “turned into five, five turned into 10,” says Billy. But they played only occasionally and remained “off in these other worlds,” adds Skolnick, who was then a full-time session player. Billy worked in transport – giving safety lectures, presumably not about smashing bottles over one’s head – while Peterson focused on his symphonic black metal band, Dragonlord, until a major 2008 tour offer with Motörhead, Heaven & Hell and Judas Priest was offered on the condition they record a new album.View image in fullscreenNo sign of slowing down … Testament in 2025.Photograph: Fred KowaloSo they did – and never stopped. A couple of decades later, Testament show no signs of slowing down, save for the occasional ballad; with new drummer Chris Dovas in tow, their latest album, Para Bellum introduces elements like icy, black metal-style tremolo riffing,with themes covering the CIA agent-mangling Havana syndrome and, naturally, AI.“Destruction’s coming by the terabyte,” growls Billy on single, Infanticide AI, “the future’s destined to replace the soul” – though Skolnick believes metal music is safe from these techno-dystopian torments. “There’s no way it’s going to sound like guys getting in a room hashing out a tune and radiating as humans,” he says.And through all their winding sonic travels, lineup changes, trials and tribulations, the sounds of each of the band’s eras radiate something distinctly human. “They’re all just different modes of us, you know?” says Peterson.Para Bellum is out now on Nuclear Blast RecordsExplore more on these topicsMetalPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The bruises on her face were fading, but she was tanned by the sun, and her cheeks and the bridge of her nose not far off from being actually burnt, so she must find some cream or ointment to deal with that. A broad-brimmed hat would help too.She spread a very little of the rose salve on her nose and lips, her cheekbones and forehead. Then she sat down and thought about Ionides.He’d been very helpful so far, but could she trust him any further? This part of the world was completely new to her, whereas Ionides was at home with the languages here, and the customs, and the modes of travel. Could she manage without his guidance? She could probably afford it. She still had most of the gold that Farder Coram had given her. Ionides hadn’t let her down yet, and besides, she liked him.The man at Marletto’s, this Mustafa Bey whom Bud Schlesinger had recommended. She didn’t know what to do. The alethiometer would have helped her decide, of course; even without the books, and without risking the sickness and disorientation of the new method, she’d have gained something from it; her knowledge of the symbols was much greater than it had been, and just to hold it would have given her thoughts something to focus on. And now it was gone.But she still had the glass, and the needle. If she didn’t find something safe to keep them in, though, she might not have them for long. The glass was merely a glass (she supposed), but the needle . . . She took it very carefully out of the pocket it was in, and laid it in the centre of a piece of scrap paper, which she folded over and over till the needle couldn’t slip out, and put it in a compartment of her rucksack.Then she thought of the old gentleman on the train, and the cards he’d given her. She took out the pack and shuffled it and spread the cards face down on the bed beside her. Now what could she do? The alethiometer worked by blending the meanings of three symbols. Should she pick three cards? Or just one? Or what?She chose one and turned it over. It showed a man behind a barricade trying to defend it from a group of soldiers, against a background of gunfire and bursting shells. She looked at it despondently for a minute or so, and gathered the cards together again.Ionides sprang to his feet as soon as he saw her come downstairs.‘Miss Silver! Now I am your guide and guardian for the journey to Marletto’s Café. May I ask if you are hoping to see the well-known and respected Mustafa Bey?’‘How did you know that?’‘It was a guess purely and entirely. A traveller of your consequence would of course wish to pay her respects to such an important gentleman, and Marletto’s is where he is to be found. It is as good as a headquarters for his multitude of enterprises.’She smiled – and it occurred to her that she couldn’t remember the last time a smile had come to her faceHe held open the hotel door and walked along beside her with the air of a senior courtier accompanying a princess. He looked no different from the ragged and none-too-clean individual who had first appeared outside her hotel room in Seleukeia, but he bore himself with such confidence and brio that Lyra felt herself to be acting a part too, and enjoying the attention of other passersby. Most of those who looked at her were disconcerted, of course, by her lack of a dæmon, but she remembered the woman she’d seen in Amsterdam, strolling along magnificently indifferent to the hostile stares of other people, and she remembered Farder Coram’s advice too, to bear herself like a queen.‘Mr Ionides,’ she said.‘I am all ears,’ he declared.‘From now on my name is Tatiana Iorekova. I am a queen of the witches of Novaya Zemlya. You are a magician from Prague, and you are in my service.’‘Ah! I completely understand. This is how I shall present you to Mustafa Bey, no?’‘That’s correct.’‘And what is my name?’‘Magister Parathanasius.’‘Parathanasius. A fine name, which I shall strive to deserve. How should I address you, Queen Tatiana?’‘Like that. Say Queen Tatiana, may I present His Excellency Mustafa Bey?’‘Not “Your Majesty”?’‘No. We witches live plainly and without ceremony. Ah! – Wait here.’ She had noticed something in the window of a dress shop, and went inside. After a minute she came out with a length of narrow scarlet ribbon.‘That for me or for you?’ said Ionides.She smiled, which surprised him, and it occurred to her that she couldn’t remember the last time a smile had come to her face. She tied the ribbon around her head, across the middle of her brow, and let the ends fall in front of her right ear.Ionides watched critically, and said, ‘You permit?’She nodded, and he adjusted the ribbon slightly.‘There. Very royal. What my name again?’‘Parathanasius. Magister. Like Maestro. Master Parathanasius.’‘From Prague.’‘That’s right.’He looked around. The street was busy; it was a late morning in a prosperous cosmopolitan city, and no one knew they were in the presence of a queen and a magician.‘All right, Queen Tatiana Iorekova,’ he said seriously. ‘You wanted me to guide you to Aleppo. Here we are, and you will soon pay me forty dollars–’‘Thirty.’‘As you say. When I take you to Mustafa Bey our contract will expire, not so?’‘That’s right.’‘And what then? The whole of Asia is open to you. What is your destination? Will you require a guide to accompany you there?’She had already made her mind up, but there were formalities and customs to observe.‘Master Parathanasius, this is not the right place nor the right time. A queen of the witches does not bargain in the street. When I have concluded my business with Mustafa Bey, you and I shall go to another smaller café and discuss the matters you raise over a glass of tea.’He nodded slowly. His expression was serious, his clothing ragged and dirty, the scar across his face white against the brown skin and the greying stubble. He looked like a beggar. But he stood upright, his body was lean and tense, and his eyes were alive with complicity and, deep inside, amusement.‘All right, we go to find Mustafa Bey,’ he said. ‘You come with me, Queen Tatiana, and my magic powers find the way.’He strode along beside her for all the world as if he really was a magician in the service of a queen. Lyra was pleased with her own bearing too. Like panthers, that was the way Farder Coram had described the way witches bore themselves. She found herself thinking something unexpected: she wanted Abdel Ionides to feel proud of her.He swept imperiously into the entrance of Marletto’s, stopping in mock astonishment only when a white-aproned waiter said a few words in French, sharply, and barred his way.‘Vous nous prenez pour des MENDIANTS?’ Ionides said in high indignation. ‘Écoutez, espèce d’imbécile. Voici sa majesté la reine Tatiana Iorekova, qui gouverne le royaume entier de Novaya Zemlya, et moi qui suis son sorcier particulier, le gardien de ses finances, le président de conseil de ses affaires d’état, le Maître Parathanasius!Queen Tatiana,’ he went on, turning to Lyra and switching in a moment from arrogant to emollient. ‘I apologise for the ignorance of this low-born rascal. Please forgive him, because now he knows who you are, he will hasten to bring you everything you desire, and conduct us without delay to a corner of this establishment which is fit to receive us. ‘And,’ he added to the waiter, ‘take word to His Excellency Mustafa Bey that Queen Tatiana Iorekova will receive him at once.’The waiter looked from Ionides to Lyra, from Queen Tatiana to Master Parathanasius. Ionides was bursting with angry pride, and Lyra held herself still and faced down the waiter with a gaze that came from the coldest fastnesses of the northern ice. Privately she was delighted.The waiter bowed nervously and led the way to a corner shaded by a potted palm whose leaves waved delicately in the breeze from a fan on the ceiling. Ionides held out a chair for her while the waiter hastened away.‘When you’ve presented him to me, you can go,’ Lyra said quietly. ‘I saw a fountain in the square as we came through. I’ll meet you there in about an hour.’‘You don’t need interpreter?’‘I’m sure I can manage. Here he comes.’Mustafa Bey was a large man in a physical sense, and an imposing one. His wealth was visible in the exquisitely cut cream linen suit, the hand-made shoes, the massive gold watch on his wrist, the golden signet ring on his little finger, the immaculately groomed grey hair; his power was manifest in the way he seemed to carry a field of magnetic force around him, compelling attention, demanding respect, knowing with utter certainty that his every wish would be not only fulfilled, but anticipated. His dæmon was a cheetah. If Lyra had not been a queen, she might even have been intimidated.Ionides inclined his head briefly and said, ‘Queen Tatiana, may I present His Excellency Mustafa Bey?’Lyra extended her right hand. The great merchant bent to kiss it, and Lyra responded with a smile.‘Please join me, Mustafa Bey,’ she said. ‘I know how busy you are. I would be grateful for a few minutes of your time.’She indicated a chair, and Mustafa Bey sat down. Ionides was giving an order to the waiter, who hurried away, and then Master Parathanasius bowed deeply to Lyra and withdrew. Mustafa Bey still had not said a word.‘I was advised to consult you,’ Queen Tatiana said, ‘by a learned scholar in Oxford, Doctor Sebastian Makepeace.’The merchant’s large and profoundly dark eyes widened a fraction of a millimetre. His expression changed from one unreadability to another.‘And there was a friend I last saw in Smyrna,’ she went on, ‘who said that the one source of all the information I would ever need on my journey was Mustafa Bey, whom I would find in this café. One such recommendation would have been enough to make me come here – two, and I had no choice. Mustafa Bey, I am glad to meet you. Will you take tea with me?’She could see the waiter hastening to her table with a loaded tray.‘I would be honoured,’ said the merchant. His voice was unexpectedly light and gentle.View image in fullscreen‘Mustafa Bey’s dæmon was a cheetah. If Lyra had not been a queen, she might even have been intimidated.’Illustration: Chris WormellThe tea was poured, the pastries were set out, the waiter bowed and left.Mustafa Bey was not going to start this conversation. He was a busy man, but he was clearly curious, and Lyra was aware that they were being watched by many eyes that were equally interested. She was glad she had not come to him as a petitioner, having to wait to be seen: this table gave her a little enclave in the middle of his territory, like an embassy, where she could command things, to which she could summon him, from which she could dictate the course of their encounter. It also meant that the initiative belonged to her: she must get on with it.‘As I mentioned, Mustafa Bey,’ she said, ‘I’m on a journey. I want to travel to the desert of Karamakan, and I would like to ask the advice of someone who knows the Silk Roads as well as anyone alive.’‘My advice would be a single word: Don’t.’‘I shall bear that in mind, but I won’t take it. I’m determined to go.’‘What do you think you will find there?’‘A red building that contains something of immense value.’‘And what is that? Do you know what is in this red building?’‘Yes, I believe I do.’‘And you still want to go there, and put your life in danger, and risk not being able to return?’‘Yes.’He sipped the hot tea. Despite his bulk, all his movements were delicate and graceful.‘I have never been to the red building myself,’ he said, ‘but I know the conditions under which it must be approached. The traveller by land, the dæmon by water. Do you?’‘Yes, I do.’‘And your dæmon?’‘The witches of the Arctic have the power of separation. At the moment, my dæmon is attending to an important piece of business somewhere else.’He nodded, and set a calming hand on the head of his cheetah-dæmon. ‘And what do you need to know about the journey between here and Karamakan?’‘How long does it take for a camel-train to go that far?’‘Six months, more or less.’‘And a traveller alone?’‘Less time, but more danger.’‘Danger from what, Mustafa Bey?’‘Bandits on the ground. And even more from birds in the air. There are no zeppelin routes across these lands for that reason. The birds are immense and ferocious. They command the air almost entirely. Do your people ever fly across Central Asia?’‘Very seldom.’‘With good reason. But, Queen Tatiana, you are not telling me the truth.’Lyra was aware of a deep soft growl, almost too quiet to hear. It was the merchant’s dæmon, whose black-rimmed eyes were staring at her throat.‘In what way?’ said Lyra. Her skin was prickling.‘You are not a witch. I have dealt with many witches – please do not interrupt me – and you are not one.’‘Could you tell at once?’‘No. I had to listen to you first. Now I am certain. Your name is Lyra Silvertongue.’The Rose Field: The Book of Dust Volume Three will be published in hardback, trade paperback, ebook and audiobook – narrated by Michael Sheen – on 23 October by David Fickling Books in association with Penguin Random House in the UK, featuring illustrations from Chris Wormell.

He and his colleagues – veteran activist Cam, and fire-in-her-belly true believer Rosa – are about to kidnap Adeline Woolsaw, 23-year-old scion of an obscenely wealthy clan who run an outsourcing company called the Woolsaw Group.The company’s parasitic, money-grabbing, cost-shaving, data-siphoning activities stand for everything that is sinister and wrong with the conjunction of capitalism and state power. But the problem its opponents have is that the Woolsaw Group’s activities are so far-reaching, and its public profile so blandly corporate, that the public can’t be persuaded to pay any attention to its wickedness: “it’s ‘the largest public service outsourcing company in the UK’, which is so boring your brain just switches off. Which is good for the Woolsaw Group.” The hope of our wee terror cell, essentially, is that kidnapping the Woolsaws’ daughter will wake people up by putting a human face on it.The abduction goes well – Adeline is bundled into the back of a van in time-honoured fashion – except for two things. One is that her kidnappers quickly realise that their hostage is in the third trimester of pregnancy; the other is that it turns out she’s positively delighted to be removed from the bosom of her family, and doesn’t under any circumstances wish to be given back.I hope it won’t be considered too spoilery of this very plot-driven novel to say that those two things are connected. Adeline’s parents aren’t evil in the mundane Capita or Serco way Luke had assumed, but in a praying-to-the-Old-Ones, black-altar-in-the-basement-and-blood-on-the-tits way. Adeline has been artificially inseminated with the seed of “The Long-Before” (sperm-collection process not specified but described as “complicated”), and is now the unwilling brood mother for your basic antichrist. He is born in captivity just a few hours after the kidnapping. His demonic nature is affirmed by the way that very yucky and inexplicable things (showers of hailstones like bullets, swarms of weird caterpillars) start happening in the infant’s vicinity as soon as he feels threatened. Adeline, pleasingly, calls him Percy – for the sole reason that it’s an absurd name to give an antichrist.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

What follows gleefully chucks every old-school horror trope you care to think of at the wall. There are murderous henchmen, dark secrets, messages from the void and arcane rituals up to and including hepatomancy. Every chapter or two something unexpected and urgent happens. Faces peel off. People are burned alive. There’s lots and lots of blood: “The MOT testing guy is lying on his back, the signboard resting halfway across him. His face and hands look like raw meat. There is a long spike protruding from his eye socket.”Ned Beauman, writing here as Kit Burgoyne, is a clever writer whose previous work has made free with genre conventions and who isn’t afraid to be funny. As well as getting on the Granta Best of Young British list and snagging a Booker longlisting forThe Teleportation Accident, he won the Arthur C Clarke science fiction award forVenomous Lumpsucker. He well understands the pleasures of a good twisty story, and as Kit Burgoyne he has what is obviously an enormous amount of fun writing weightless 1970s-style pulp horror. There is a (slight) nod to the Serious Issues that the real-world equivalents of the Woolsaw Group create, costing lives as they cut costs, exercising unaccountable power, sucking on the teat of the state and buying up politicians, etc. There’s a flicker of interest, but not much more than a flicker, in the psychology of the protagonists: in Luke’s relationship with Rosa, his feelings for Adeline, Cam’s activism, the Woolsaws’ marriage.But, quite properly, sociopolitical commentary and subtlety of characterisation are not Beauman/Burgoyne’s priorities. He is, as I say, having fun – and the reader of this accomplished and super-readable romp has fun too.The Captive by Ned Beauman writing as Kit Burgoyne is published by Titan (£19.99).

The pricier of the two portable gaming devices dropping on 16 October, the all-black ROG Xbox Ally X will cost you a cool £799 (€899/$999/A$1599) to sample its splendour. (The less powerful ROG Xbox Ally, which comes in white, will run you £499/€599/$599/A$999.) Thankfully, the pricier option has said splendour in spades.I’ve put the ROG Xbox Ally X through its paces for the last few weeks, playing indie darlings and massive role-playing games throughout my apartment. Though the price tag is certainly a shocker (the Steam Deck OLED, a direct competitor, costs £479/€569/$549/A$899 for its cheaper model), the power packed into this comparatively smaller frame (291 x 122 x 51mm) is like nothing the portable gaming market has seen before.That power, coupled with its ability to play Xbox games through cloud gaming or its Play Anywhere initiative (where purchases and process carry between Xbox andPCplatforms), and PC games across various storefronts, makes it incredibly appealing to both Xbox loyalists and portable gaming fans alike. Though the ROG Xbox Ally X had a few hiccups during my time with it, and some user interface issues that interfered with performance, most of them were easily rectified and quickly forgotten once I was deep into playing a game.View image in fullscreenPlayable at home or on the go … ROG Xbox Ally X.Photograph: ROGSetting up the ROG Xbox Ally XSetting up the ROG Xbox Ally X isn’t frictionless. Though the device will launch into a dedicated full-screen Xbox experience that mimics both the Xbox console and PC app, it’s still a handheld running the Windows 11 operating system, and it needs an update before you can get going. This took a little time, and with all the pop-up notifications and steps of the standard Windows experience, it feels a bit odd for a gaming handheld.For the first day, despite adding my Xbox account immediately, the device told me that I didn’t have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – the upper tier of Microsoft’s gaming subscription service – and my attempts to re-link my account were in vain. The next day, it randomly worked. It also struggled to connect to my home wifi after waking from sleep mode – though weirdly, this also rectified itself after the first 24 hours.Once I got my various accounts connected (since this is a Windows handheld, you can also download PC game launchers like Steam, EpicGamesStore, and Blizzard’s Battle.net), the ROG Xbox Ally X ran pretty well.In a user friendly touch, it boots straight into the familiar Xbox user interface, but pulls games from the other game launchers, to ensure you can jump right into whatever you were just playing, no matter where it’s hosted.Thiscanbe an issue, however, if you’re playing say a Steam game, then jump back to the Xbox dedicated launcher and try to start a game through another storefront. The ROG Xbox Ally X doesn’t automatically close the last game you had open, or even ask you if you want to close it, which obviously kneecaps performance. And there were also a few moments where it kind of hung, suspended, in the Xbox interface and didn’t respond to any of my inputs.There was also a moment where the handheld slogged through a download of a rather beefy RPG, repeatedly losing connection whenever it would go idle, forcing me to resume the process manually. But after a reboot, it sailed through the rest of the file download without a hitch.View image in fullscreenSwitching between applications … ROG Xbox Ally X.Photograph: ROGROG Xbox Ally performanceThe above issues can hopefully be solved with a simple user interface (UI) update, because when it’s not being a bit finicky, the ROG Xbox Ally X performs incredibly well. There’s a bit of sluggishness when trying to boot up at low battery levels (sub-15%), but Supergiant Games’ beloved roguelike sequel,Hades II, launches fast and plays perfectly with no discernible load times between areas. Meatier games such asAvowedand PC mainstays like Backyard Baseball run smooth as butter, with beautiful frame rates and very little load times.Though the ROG Xbox Ally X doesn’t have an OLED screen, I’d be surprised if anyone really misses it. Games look incredible on its 7-inch, 1080p display. The glimmers and glints of Hades II’s mostly stationary characters are a visual feast; I let out a soft gasp when the moon goddess Selene first appeared, her pearlescent gown shimmering blue and sea-foam green.Xbox and Asus cleverly routed some system resources towards higher frame rates, and it pays off when playing a game as visually busy and punishing as Hades II–at no point am I so overwhelmed by what’s playing out that I can’t make sense of the battle at hand and act accordingly.The speakers are also fantastic for immersion. At one point in Hades II, I walked past the goddess of the hunt, Artemis, who was sitting in a moonlit glade quietly singing to herself. As I moved, her song emanated only from the left speaker, telling me she was still there behind me, even though I could no longer see her. Those kinds of beautiful details really shine.As for looks, the ROG Xbox Ally X may be initially odd – it’s like someone cut an Xbox controller in half and then soldered a screen between its grips – but the matt black finish is incredibly sleek, and the adjustable LEDs that ring the joysticks offer just the right amount of gamer-style finish.View image in fullscreenPowerful hardware … ROG Xbox Ally X.Photograph: ROGGaming on the go, or on the couchDuring my time with the ROG Xbox Ally X, I’ve played it lying prone in bed, propped up on the couch, leaning on the counter while waiting for pasta water to boil, and at my desk during writing breaks. After10 minutes of hands-on timethis summer, I wasn’t sure if the rather large handheld would be comfortable for me during longer sessions. But actually, holding it is comfortable even after a couple of hours of playtime. At 715g, though heavier than the less powerful ROG Xbox Ally (670g) and Steam Deck OLED (640g), the weight difference is negligible, especially because the controller-inspired grips are incredibly ergonomic. The only time I felt uncomfortable was after sitting with it held up above me on the couch with no elbow or wrist support; then, my pinkies got a little sore from holding its weight.The battery life is great (coming in at 80Wh, more than the ROG Xbox Ally’s 60Wh), considering what’s under the hood. I could play Hades II for two hours straight with no issue, including a run that lasted 20 minutes at 22%, which only dropped the battery to 10%. Although parts of the handheld got a little warm during especially long play sessions, it was never excessively hot.ROG Xbox Ally X’s game libraryAs for games, the device cleverly leverages the Xbox Play Anywhere initiative, which reflects Microsoft’s recent push for you to access its games, including a library of 1,000 purchasable Xbox and Xbox Game Pass subscription games across multiple devices, such as on PC, Xbox consoles, and now ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, with your progress intact.As someone who once owned a Steam Deck, and who has had an Xbox Game Pass for years, the ROG Xbox Ally X is my platonic ideal for a handheld console. I prefer the way Xbox controllers feel in my hands, and this device mimics that. I enjoy dipping into the Xbox Game Pass library to try out a new game, and this device lets me take that on the go – and if it’s a Play Anywhere title, which most games are, I also don’t need to worry about having internet access to enjoy it.If you’ve got the funds and are in the market for a powerful gaming handheld that can not only play PC games from a digital store of your choosing, but also an impressive suite of Xbox games, the ROG Xbox Ally X would be a good end of year splurge.The ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X is out today, October 16; £479-£799/$599-$999Explore more on these topicsGamesXboxHandheldPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Our writer revels in its avaricious, champagne-drenched excesses. Will he leave wearing a suit of Greek armour?Eddy FrankelThu 16 Oct 2025 07.45 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 17.27 EDTShareOn the face of things, Frieze is pretty awful. It represents the art world at its most brazenly commercial, its most avaricious and capitalistic. This is the market laid bare, with all of its champagne, ludicrous outfits and obscene excess on brazen display for anyone willing to fork out a wodge on a ticket. That’s what reviews of Frieze generally complain about, all the greedy capitalistic knives being stabbed into the heart of their beloved, pure art.But Frieze, and the more refined Frieze Masters, isn’t really about art. Sure, this art fair in Regent’s Park, London, is the biggest art fair in the UK, attracting all the best galleries and artists in the world. But Frieze isn’t about painting and sculpture and conceptualism – it’s about selling. Going to Frieze is all about mindset. If you come here looking for innovation, emotion and aesthetic brilliance, you’re going to be let down. But if you come here to experience the art world – to watch deals get done, to see the market in full flight – it’s genuinely a huge amount of fun.View image in fullscreenMid-grimace … Glen Pudvine at Xxijra Hii gallery.Photograph: Glen PudivineBe warned: by attending Frieze you are inevitably going to see a gargantuan amount of utterly pointless, totally anonymous, immediately forgettable painting. Abstract, figurative, geometric, whatever you want, there is an endless amount of it here, because it sells, and almost all of it sucks. You will see ceramics that look as if they were made by four-year-olds. You will also see some of the absolute best facelifts money can buy. Some of the people here are pulled so taut they’d rip if they sneezed.The fair is vast, maybe even interminable. The key is to follow your instincts. Look at everything but only stop and consider the stuff that hits you immediately. That’s what Frieze is for – flexing your art muscles and going with your gut.The fair is divided into sections: Focus, Artist-to-Artist, various curated/themed areas, and then the main fair. Focus is the place for young galleries, and it’s invariably where you will find the most interesting, experimental art.It kicks off this year with London-based painter Glen Pudvine at Xxijra Hii gallery, who has filled his mirrored booth with huge, nude self-portraits, capturing himself in ludicrous mid-grimace doing a kettlebell workout. They are stunningly painted: he puts more effort into capturing the folds of a scrotum than most artists put into faces. They’re funny images, silly even, yet also brilliantly unique takedowns of fragile masculinity.If you’ve never found whales sexy before then Luís Lázaro Matos’s pastels should turn your head. They reimagine Benny the Beluga, a whale that got stranded in the Thames in 2018, as a Speedo-wearing Mediterranean party animal living it up as a literal fish out of water. In the middle of the Public gallery booth, Xin Liu has created a metallic pond, bubbling with duckweed under neon grow lights, all surrounded by strange, bio-mechanical paintings.View image in fullscreenTake the weight off … Barbara Walker paintings in the background at Frieze.Photograph: Nick Harvey/ShutterstockThe Artist-to-Artist section sees young artists selected by big names. Ana Segovia was selected by Mexican conceptualist Abraham Cruzvillegas, and her closeup paintings of cowboys’ crotches are all denim, leather and rampant sensuality.In the main bit of the fair, Gagosian’s solo presentation by Lauren Halsey is a rare moment of bold joy in an otherwise fairly safe and dour bit of the tent. The LA artist has created huge cast plaster murals of everyday black life – kids, cars, games, barbershops, gyms – in a sort of ancient Egyptian take on American street culture. It buzzes with the life-force of south central LA.The fair is absolutely filled with artists ripping off Huma Bhabha’s post-nuclear, pock-marked, sci-fi take on sculpture – there seems to be one every 15 metres – and when you finally get to an original at the David Zwirner booth you realise how much better she is than her imitators. The bust on display here is classic Bhabha, all grim, apocalyptic grossness.View image in fullscreenLose your head … a work called El otro protagonista de la noche by Enrique Lopez Llamas at the Llano stand.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesI’d happily take home at least one of the two Celia Paul portraits at Victoria Miro, and the huge John Baldessari at Sprüth Magers would no doubt look great above the sofa. The super gruesome, cartoony Peter Saul drawings at Michael Werner are stunning, as are the works on paper by Turner prize-nominated (and likely winner)Nnena Kalu.At Frieze Masters, 10 minutes north, the experience is totally different. Mainly dedicated to work from before the year 2000, it’s endlessly more refined, quiet and elegant than its brash counterpart. Want an ancient Roman bust? A suit of Greek armour? A Marc Chagall? A Marcel Duchamp? A giant triceratops skull?! This is where you’ll get it.Elsewhere on show: an elephantine Giorgio de Chirico, a glimmering deep sea blue Yves Klein on paper, some eye melting op art by Victor Vasarely and Yoshio Sekine, loads of amazing Dutch flower paintings and a jaw-dropping display of wispy, perfect ancient Roman glass.Is Frieze this year better than last year? Is it worse? Neither, really. Frieze is Frieze. It’s hectic, overwhelming, filled with way too much art and way too many rich people. It’s beautiful, stupid, pompous, ridiculous and absolutely exhausting – it’s the art world at its worst, but also at its best. Let’s hope it never changes.Frieze and Frieze Masters are atRegent’s Park, London, until 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFrieze art fairArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Quite something, because of the competition. One of the great strengths of this rewarding production – the first to be staged by James Brining since he became artistic director – is its sharp characterisation. Every one of Chekhov’s frustrated figures, variously in search of love, validation and applause, is drawn here in bold lines, clear and precise.For Quentin to stand out in the role of Irina Arkadina, the egotistical repertory actor slumming it in the country for the summer, means pulling the focus from a richly realised ensemble. When she holds court, centre stage, it is as if she draws Lizzie Powell’s early-autumn lights towards her, glowing in the attention while the rest of the busy household becomes her attentive, obedient audience.“I care about myself,” she says, leaving a fractional pause before spitting out: “… passionately!”It is a funny, bold performance and starry only in the sense she is playing a star. In Mike Poulton’s light-footed translation, Quentin plays just one lost soul among many. She turns her insecurities into noise and fanfare, in contrast to the quiet despair of a boozy Masha (Tallulah Greive), a hangdog Medvedenko (Michael Dylan) or an apologetic Polina (Irene Allan) – all excellent.View image in fullscreenRewarding production … Harmony Rose-Bremner in The Seagull.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicHer young lover Trigorin (Dyfan Dwyfor) keeps quiet and goes along for the ride, while her son Konstantin (Lorn Macdonald) is trapped in an Oedipal bind, unsure whether to upturn or embrace the old order. Such an attitude fails to impress aspirant actor Nina (Harmony Rose-Bremner) who chooses the urbane glamour of Trigorin and lives to regret it.With equally distinct performances from Forbes Masson as Dr Dorn, John Bett as Sorin and Steven McNicoll as Shamrayev, Brining’s production has a certainty that brings out Chekhov’s humour as much as his pathos. Played out amid the distressed grandeur of Colin Richmond’s set, the colour of straw as if drained of life, it loses some momentum in the closing confrontation between Konstantin and Nina, a relationship too deranged to be heartbreaking. Even so, this is a vibrant, flavoursome and sure-footed start to Brining’s tenure.AtRoyal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Lyceum theatreCaroline QuentinAnton ChekhovreviewsShareReuse this content"

How did you write it?EamonmccI was still learning about songwriting and by the time I got to Something/Anything? [1972, featuring I Saw the Light] I was slipping into formula – verse, chorus, bridge and so on, always about the girl or boy who broke your heart. I moved my hands about the keyboard and 20 minutes later that song was done. It’s partly why I went completely off the grid for my next album, A Wizard, a True Star [1973] – because I realised I couldn’t keep cranking out songs in 20 minutes about that one relationship in high school. The prettiest girl in school had suddenly taken a shine to me – I think because I had long hair, which was also the reason her dad made her break up with me, which messed me up pretty bad.Wikipedia says A Wizard,a True Star was “heavily informed by Rundgren’s hallucinogenic experiences”. Were you actually taking LSD?mjhmjhI didn’t smoke or drink anything until my first album [Runt, in 1970]. In my first band they’d smoke pot and the rehearsal would turn into a 30-minute giggling session. Then, when I was 21 I was living in [rhythm section] the Sales brothers’ house and their mom said “I can’t believe you’ve never had a drink” and got me drunk. Then my best friend who was studying to be a psychiatrist suggested I try psychoactives. I trusted him implicitly, so I did. I was taking drugs occasionally throughout the building of the studio. Not when we were doing the music – I had to run the sessions – but I remember lying on my back as high as a kite trying to do the wiring. Through psychoactives I discovered there was more going on in my head than that high school relationship.In your bookThe Individualistyou said thatwhen you were travelling aroundyou wrote a song but didn’t have a recorder, so kept replaying it in your head until you got back to the States. Which song was it?JanetDMI believe it was Lost Horizon. I was in a little hotel room in Kathmandu and a song started going round in my head. The only way I could remember it was to visualise a piano keyboard and practise the piano part on the imaginary keyboard, so when I got back I was able to play it. You never know when a song will hit you. I once woke up in the middle of the night with Bang the Drum All Day in my head. It wasn’t a song I’d normally have written, but I’ve realised that my subconscious doesn’t stop when I go to sleep.Did Levon Helm really chase you around the studio when the Band were makingStage Fright?tomcasagrandaThere may have been an episode. It was my first major project as an engineer and I was a smart-ass kid, like calling Garth [Hudson] “old man” thinking he was too old to stay awake, not realising he had narcolepsy. I wasn’t into that kind of music and not cognitive of the fact the Band were one of the biggest acts in the world. They suddenly had all the money, drugs, drink and sycophants available to them and it affected some of the guys. Levon got into opiates so while he may have chased me round the studio he spent as much time underneath a pile of curtains, dead to the world. In later years they all became my friends … except Robbie [Robertson], who was kind of a snob.When you produced Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell, did [composer] Jim Steinman mean it, or was it a parody of the ever earnest Bruce Springsteen?roxusrollusSteinman never admitted what a Springsteen fan he was, even though he took me to see him, but from my point of view it was a parody. Everyone they’d played stuff to had said the songs were too long and Meat Loaf was too weird, but I heard it in the context of Springsteen’s leather jackets/50s thing – but not a handsome guy from New Jersey, a big sweaty guy. It’s not that well known that Steinman had a keen sense of humour, so even in the most sincere moments Steinman is taking it purposely over the top. That album unleashed a force upon the world – the brand of excess. After that everything Steinman did was excessive.View image in fullscreenWith Meat Loaf during Musicourt ‘82 at Forest Hills in New York City.Photograph: Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty ImagesWhat wasLaura Nyrolike when you worked together – and why do you think she’s not held up alongside the likes of Joni Mitchell and Carole King?laurasnapesI met her just after Eli and the Thirteenth Confession [1968] and was in awe of her. She asked me to be her bandleader but I was busy with my own band, the Nazz. Over a decade later she’d built a house with a studio but couldn’t get an album started so called me in desperation. We worked on each song until she was satisfied, but I became uncomfortable because she had a girlfriend there offering opinions which meant more than mine. I withdrew, but she did finish the record [Mother’s Spiritual, 1984]. Her music was remarkably sophisticated and passionate, completely individual, but audiences don’t really want people who sound completely different to everybody else. Some artists exist to influence other artists, to go where others won’t and show them how.Todd Rundgren: ‘It’s hard to find sincerely musical artists nowadays. The music is just mediocre’Read moreYourDIY approach to recording albums was apparently a huge influence on Prince, andBebe Buellhas spoken of a young and star-struck Prince Rogers Nelsonwaiting to meet you backstage at a show. Do you have any recollection of this?TheManWithoutFearNo recollection whatsoever, which isn’t to say it didn’t happen. Prince took the play-every-instrument thing to another level. I wanted to write beyond what I could play and realised there are better players, whereas he tailored the songs to his capabilities as a player. So the drums are simple, certainly not like Stevie Wonder’s, who was a crazily funky drummer. I thought some of Prince’s stuff was great but some of the lyrics made no sense to me at all. I don’t know what the hell Purple Rain is. Is it some kind of pollution?View image in fullscreenRundgren poses for a portrait in Los Angeles, California, circa 1977.Photograph: Aaron Rapoport/Getty ImagesDid you keep the amusing letters that John Lennonsent you?kaipaheadI met him at a party in the period he was drinking with Harry Nilsson and misbehaving all over Hollywood. He looked like a bundle of rags in the corner and as a Beatles fan I was disappointed that he had nothing to say. Later I was being interviewed by NME and I said something along the lines of that you can’t be a revolutionary and preach one thing if you’re behaving in another way, and that became the headline. John wrote a letter ostensibly to me but as an open letter in NME. There was a kerfuffle. Then one day I got a call and it was John, saying: “I think we’re being used here, so let’s bury the hatchet.” I said: “Fine” and that was that.What do you think of theXTC album Skylarking, 39 yearsafter you produced it? Is it hard to divorce the record from the notoriously fraught recording sessions?Angrysince1967I don’t think Andy [Partridge] ever wanted a producer. He’d already steamrollered over the likes of Steve Lillywhite and Gus Dudgeon. When I did Skylarking, Gus sent me a letter of condolence. Everything came to a head when we recorded Earn Enough for Us, the only song on the entire album where they played together. It was great, but the next day Andy made Colin [Moulding] punch in every note of the bass part. I said “Oh God, for once you did something like XTC the band …” and Andy flipped out. I told him “I’m just trying to make the best record I can for you guys”, and he said “Then why do I feel like cleaving your head in with an axe?” Andy told anyone that would listen that it was the worst record they ever made, but I heard he has since confessed it’s one of their best.View image in fullscreenRundgren performs on the Midnight Special.Photograph: NBC/Universal/Getty ImagesWhen you produced theNew York Dolls’ debut did you realisethe record would prove so divisive – a well-known UK television presenter called them “mock rock”?willcantopherI don’t think that was inaccurate. Most people categorise them as punk rock simply because John Lydon cited them as the principle influence on the Sex Pistols. Technically the New York Dolls wanted to be the Rolling Stones: that album cover is straight from the Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? era. The more cynical rock critics like Lester Bangs liked them because it was the kind of music a rock critic could play – three chords. Even though the Dolls were New York celebrities in Max’s Kansas City every night they all lived out on Long Island, some of ’em with their moms.To say you’re prolific would be an understatement. I particularly like Liars, State and White Knight of your most recent catalogue. How do you rate these albums in your body of work?MonsieurMadeleineWith Liars I was getting my sea legs after the transition from the traditional record company model to the internet thing. State was essentially me trying to get up to date with techniques I’d kinda pioneered in the 70s but another generation had taken over, like electronic and drum’n’bass. White Knight was my first serious collaborative record, so I wasn’t continually stewing in my own juices. For my last album, Space, I got people to give me demos of songs they’d never finished, and we’d finish them together. I am working on a new record, which I’ll finish after the next touring leg, but playing live keeps me youthful. My body likes me to get out there for two and a half hours each night.

We have a colleague who has a friend who is a Swift fan and she noticed the video’s opening scene had a similarity [with the Heyser painting] and we thought, wow, what a coincidence – that’s exciting.”Although the museum has been unsuccessful so far in its attempts to reach Swift’s team, it did not take long for fans to make the connection themselves, as word spread on social media.Hirschmann estimated that 500 people visited last weekend specifically to see Heyser’s Ophelia painting, having asked museum personnel where they could find it – far eclipsing the usual amount of interest in the wispily romantic image showing Ophelia’s rosebud lips slightly parted and her lifeless body surrounded by water lilies.The visitors, many of them young women and girls, have been posing for photos before the painting. “It’s a lot more teens than we usually see,” Hirschmann said.She said the museum, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year, was caught completely off guard by its brush with Swift-mania.Hirschmann said: “We have a wonderful art nouveau collection. Many of our guests want to see Alphonse Mucha; they want to see Hector Guimard. But this is the first time we’ve really had a run on a painting.”“I always liked it,” she said of the Heyser portrait, adding: “Thanks toTaylor Swift, it’s entered a whole new dimension.”At first, the museum’s management was worried that a rush of Swifties could be disruptive to the other guests, but Hirschmann said the fans had “a respectful approach”. “It’s really lovely for us that suddenly everybody is talking about art too, thanks to a global star like Taylor Swift,” she said. “It’s crazy.”It is not the first time the singer has borrowed from Shakespeare for material, with the 2008 hit Love Story taking a page from Romeo and Juliet.It is unclear why Swift appears to have drawn inspiration from Heyser’s vision of Hamlet’s Ophelia, who drowns in a river after her lover accidentally kills her father. In Swift’s song, the “eldest daughter of a nobleman” who “lived in fantasy” meets a happier ending.Initially, Swift watchers thought she had found her muse for the opening scene of the video in thebetter-known workby John Everett Millais from 1852 at London’s Tate museum, but the colour of the dress and the angle of her pose pointed them to Heyser.Now, staff in Wiesbaden are speculating whether the American superstar had been in their midst to see the painting for herself without their knowledge, perhaps during her three-city sweep throughGermanyin July 2024 during the Eras tour.“That would be truly insane!” Hirschmann said. “We did ask ourselves: how did this come about? Did she pick the painting out? Has she seen it for herself? Was it a member of her team? I think if Taylor Swift came here, even incognito, we would have noticed.”Seizing on the unexpected opportunity, the museum has organised an Ophelia reception on 2 November, including a guided tour explaining the history of the painting, Shakespeare’s character and her depiction in Swift’s tune.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftEuropePaintingArtGermanyMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

This time around, it’s jumping from one season to the next after only five episodes (which, granted, have come in bi-monthly instalments, not counting the abrupt season finale that was pushed back a week due to a blown deadline).They’ve finally gone there: South Park lets rip at Benjamin NetanyahuRead moreTonight’s episode, titled Twisted Christian, kicks off season 28. At South Park Elementary, PC Principal – the PC standing for Power Christian ever since his politically motivated conversion at the start of last season – attempts to put a stop to his students’ obsession with the “6-7” TikTok meme, not because it is insufferable or disruptive, but because he considers it “some satanic numerology shit”. Rather than seeking help from the school’s new guidance counsellor, Jesus Christ, he turns to the world’s top expert on the antichrist:billionaire Peter Thiel. (The show’s caricature of Thiel – sunken skeletal visage with bulging bug eyes – is up there with Kristi Noem’s from earlier this year in terms of viciousness.)Thiel dives into the lore of the antichrist, revealing that God’s punishment of Satan after the war in heaven was to shrink his butthole down to the size of a pinhole, “so that [he] could never have a butt baby … until along came MrDonald Trump, whose penis is so teeny-teeny-tiny it could actually fit in Satan’s asshole.” The size of Trump’s penis? Somewhere between 6-7cm. All of this is foretold in Revelation 6:7, natch.We’re also shown a scheming JD Vance, who seems to be the one pulling the strings rather than Satan or Trump. He is doing everything in his power to stop the birth of his boss’s unholy spawn, including giving his benefactor Thiel unlimited access to every government database while also convincing Trump to seek out an abortion.Donald Trump takes a back seat to other characters here, although several scenes are dedicated to his nether regions (including a couple of attempts at masturbation with the help of a pair of tweezers), making this by far the most explicit and outrageous episode since the last season premiere.View image in fullscreen‘A full-blown case of demonic possession’ … Cartman in South Park season 28, episode one: Twisted Christian.Photograph: ParamountMeanwhile, back in South Park, Jesus suffers a crisis of faith after spending time with PC Principal and other Maga Christians (“You need a way to bully people and you’re using the Bible to do it!”), while Eric Cartman’s unhealthy obsession with the “6-7” meme turns into a full-blown case of demonic possession, replete with violent projectile vomiting a la The Exorcist. It turns out he may have the key to stopping the apocalypse. Jesus eventually gives in to peer pressure and embraces a Christian bro lifestyle, while Cartman heads to DC, where a face-to-face with Trump is all but inevitable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though over thirty years has past since we were together, the memories remain vivid, and with her passing, they have returned with a force that is both painful and moving.”Pacino and Keaton starred together inThe Godfatherin 1972 and the pair had an on-and-off romantic relationship into the 1980s. Keaton once called him “the most entertaining man” who had “the most beautiful face”.“She lived without limits, and everything she touched carried her unmistakable energy,” Pacino said. “She opened doors for others, inspired generations, and embodied a once-in-a-lifetime gift that radiated through her work and her life. On screen, she was magnetic – lightning and charm, hurricanes and tenderness. She was a wonder. Acting was her art, but it was only one of the many ways she expressed her imagination and creativity.”He added that she was “unstoppable, resilient, and above all, deeply human”.Keaton toldPeoplein 2017 that she had a crush on Pacino when they started working together. “I was mad for him,” she said. “Charming, hilarious, a nonstop talker. There was an aspect of him that was like a lost orphan, like this kind of crazy idiot savant. And oh, gorgeous!”She said she “worked hard” on the relationship but when he wouldn’t commit to marriage, she gave him an ultimatum and it ended. “I went about it in not a perfect way,” she added.Pacino is one of many Hollywood names to have paid tribute to Keaton. Michael Douglascalledher “one of the greatest icons in our industry” while Francis Ford Coppolacalledher “creativity personified”.Nancy Meyers, who directed Keaton in Something’s Gotta Give, alsoremembereda “giant” in an Instagram post. “A brilliant actress who time and again laid herself bare to tell our stories,” she wrote. “As a woman, I lost a friend of almost 40 years – at times over those years, she felt like a sister because we shared so many truly memorable experiences. As a film-maker, I’ve lost a connection with an actress that one can only dream of.”Explore more on these topicsDiane KeatonAl PacinoThe GodfathernewsShareReuse this content"

My sister-in-law won’t let anyone hold thebaby, althoughthe grandparents on both sides of the family were allowed one-off holds. At family events, as soon as the baby makes the slightest cry, her mum whips her away to a room as far from everyone else as possible. Usually they leave shortly after that.No one says anything to her, to avoid confrontation and the “new mum” factor, butonly allowing the babycontact with her parentsseems likeit will buildproblemslater on. It is already difficult in the moment for everyone else, my brother included. The natural inclination is to engage with a very small baby. It’s such a short time they are like that. Already everyone else has been left out– there’s a sense of ownership and that we are all out of bounds. Even in photos, she holds the baby twisted away from everyone else. It feels extreme. Is it? How can Ibe supportive without feeding that extremeness (if it is)?My brother and sister are angry at my parents. I feel caught in the middle. What can I do? | Leading quesstionsRead moreEleanor says:There could be so many different reasons she’s made this choice. It could be about illness. A lot of parents limit visitors or cuddles in the first few months; it just takes one relative forgetting they have a cold or a cold sore. It could be about overstimulation. Maybe she doesn’t want to deal with the possible aftermath of the baby getting overwhelmed by multiple faces, noises, smells. It could be anxiety; maybe all day-long parenting, books and her postpartum imagination remind her of everything that could go wrong. There could be medical things we don’t know, emotional things we don’t know. It could just be her preference. This decision could be completely neurotic, or completely rational.The only thing we know for sure is that this is the decision she (and your brother) have made.You might think “I wish she wouldn’t do this when it costs the rest of us something so lovely”. She might think “I wish people wouldn’t expect me to do what’s lovely for them when that means making myself or my child less comfortable”.Which of you should have to accommodate the other? Natural answer: it should be about what’s best for the baby.You write that there might be issues for the child later if nothing changes. Maybe. Maybe not. I don’t know. Maybe she’ll give the child a complex by holding on way too tight. Or maybe a relative with the flu will think “yeah, yeah” and give the baby a kiss. Maybe she has too much of an anxious grip on the baby and she’ll be a better parent if she loosens it. Or maybe she’s trying to teach herself and her child that you don’t have to do what your family wants. I genuinely do not know who’s right, because we don’t know the full reasoning.But how we interact with a parent’s decision is not just a matter of who’s right. There are all kinds of ways things might be better for a child if their parents did things differently. Less screen time, less indulgence, see this side of the family more, teach them like this instead. A lot of us see parenting we think will cause issues, and some of the time we’re wrong. All of the time, it’s not our kid.She might be wrong about what’s best for the baby. But parents are allowed to get things wrong. They’re especially allowed to get things wrong out of caution in the first few months.My friend is unreasonable with his four-year-old. How can I help him be a better dad? | Leading questionsRead moreIf she does become an anxious parent in ways you think are extreme, it’s still worth keeping in mind the distinction between emotional truths it would be good for someone to know and emotional truths we should be the ones to point out. There will be doctors and daycares in this child’s life, professionals at raising kids who can help offset any problems. What might she and her child need that they can only get from your side of the family?What I’m really hearing is you feel hurt to be so left out and treated like a threat. Maybe your relationship with her is the thing to try to change, not who gets to hold the baby. What’s happening between you to make you want more involvement than she’s prepared to grant? If your answer is “she’s too anxious”, she’s probably sensed you think that. Anxiety doesn’t respond very well to being told it’s mistaken; it responds to feeling safe. Building a closer relationship might be as simple as trying to find out what she wants most at this moment and trying to give her that, rather than helping in ways you think are right.This letter has been editedAsk Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsFamilyLeading questionsParents and parentingAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was known to commit – just look atthis look from the 2004 Oscars. But there are ways to bring a dash of menswear to even the most quote unquote girly wardrobe. Playing around with shirts over skirts might be one option. Themost recent Chanel showis a good place to look for inspiration (seehereandhere).

In Something’s Gotta Give, she ditched the more formal white skirt suit and channelled a more laid-back, creamy Hamptons vibe. If you’re feeling brave – and don’t have young children – then this is a Keaton look that is alsovery much a thing this autumn.

This LK Bennett corsage feels like an easy win for the right person, and eBay is full of costume brooches to suit most if not all tastes.

For instance, think polka dots with stripes, as Keaton did regularly. Or one kind of check with another. Vary the scale of pattern and, if you’re starting to feel motion sick, anchor with a neutral. If you need to borrow some bravery, just repeat these wise Keaton words: “So you make a mistake here and there; you do too much or you do too little. Just have fun. Smile. And keep putting on lipstick.”A belt over outerwearThis was a woman who absolutely loved to put a fettuccine-thick belt over a blazer or a coat (see above), or a blazer and a coat; a suit, a skirt; anything. So dig out an old belt and try uncoupling yourself from the idea that a belt needs loops. Instead,try it over a blazer, or a longer coat – the Me+Em website has some good styling inspiration (hereandhere). Go for something slimmer, such as this Baukjen belt, if such a sizable belt as Keaton’s isn’t your bag.View image in fullscreenSlim belt£59 at BaukjenA turtleneck under … anythingAnother styling trick that feels as 2025 as it does era-less and Keaton-esque is wearing a turtleneck under just about anything. Hers tended to be black – such as the silky Micromodal one from ethically minded brand Ninety Percent below –or white, but maybe this is your chance to addsome pattern, such as this blue plaid merino wool one from Cos.M&S predictably also has several functional cotton funnel necksperfect for layering.For more inspiration, look to themost recent Celine catwalk– where turtlenecks underpinned almost every look.View image in fullscreenLong-sleeved roll neck£30 at Ninety PercentA pair of tailored trousersOf course the star of Annie Hall spent a lifetime wearing the kind of high-waisted trousers that are now two-a-penny – this loose yet tailored wool-blend pair from & Other Stories is just one of a gazillion. Style as you would any other pair of high-waisted trousers in your wardrobe, although some kind of menswear-esque top half would be the most Keaton – and thank her for her part in championing high waistlines time and time again.View image in fullscreenTailored wool trousers£119 at StoriesFor more, read thebest coats for autumn and winterandhow to master transitional dressing***Ellie Violet Bramley is a writer who has been delving into style and what it means for nearly a decade – mostly for the Guardian’s fashion deskExplore more on these topicsDiane KeatonThe FilterWomen's trousersAccessoriesWomen's topsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That means it’s also time to start thinking about beauty Advent calendars.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It may still feel early, but our favourite brands and retailers have already released their 2025 calendars, many of which sell out long before the festive season starts. In fact, theSpace NK beauty Advent calendar, which was my top recommendation, sold out at the end of September.Offering a selection of high-end cosmetics for less than their usual price, beauty Advent calendars have become a holy grail for the beauty obsessed. There are dozens to choose from at wildly different prices, some focusing on specific product types, and some filled with a mixture of bestsellers.To help with choice paralysis, I’ve been trawling the shelves for calendars filled with cult favourites suitable for various skin types and preferences, narrowing down the 10 best beauty Advent calendars of the 2025 season.While these Advent calendars can’t exactly be seen as a net positive for the environment, I also looked at their recyclability and for calendars with the broadest possible appeal, to avoid any wasted products.At a glanceBest beauty Advent calendar overall:CultBeautythe Classic Curation£240 at Cult BeautyBest value beauty Advent calendar:Lookfantastic beauty Advent calendar£105 at LookfantasticBest for bath lovers:Lush refillable Advent calendar£205 at LushBest for essential makeup and skincare:Boots 24 Beauty Stars premium Advent calendar£150 at BootsBest for product range:Next 25 days of beauty Advent calendar£95 at NextBest entry-level calendar:W7 Beauty Blast Advent calendar£19.95 at AmazonBest skincare Advent calendar:Elemis Wonders Advent calendar£225 at ElemisWhy you should trust meI make a living testing health and beauty products, from hair masks andhairdryerstobody moisturisersand concealers. That means I’m more familiar with the best formulations than many beauty fanatics.Testing hundreds of products means I’ve become an expert in all things skincare, hair care and makeup – the main contents of beauty Advent calendars. I also have a certification in cosmetic science, so I know how to identify the best products for specific skin and hair needs. As someone with sensitive skin, I also know which ingredients are likely to irritate, so I’ve only selected calendars where products are suitable for most people – so that nothing goes to waste.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I made sure every calendar in this roundup was made from, and delivered in, domestically recyclable or reusable packaging.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianI judged each beauty Advent calendar on its product range, the broad usefulness of those products to most people, and the quality and sustainability of its packaging. I longlisted 25 of the most popular calendars from department stores and brands, narrowing down my options based on the contents of each calendar. I then shortlisted the 15 calendars with the best product range and value for money to test at home.Getting hands on with each calendar gave me a better idea of how it is packaged and delivered, its quality and feel, and the merits and size of the products inside. From a sustainability perspective, I made sure every calendar in this roundup was made from, and delivered in, domestically recyclable or reusable packaging.The goodies inside the calendars generally came in packaging that can be recycled at home, but all can otherwise be taken to one of many cosmetic recycling schemes, where pumps, sprays and bottles can be recycled properly. These include Space NK’s collaboration withHandle, and theRecycle at Boots scheme, which gets you extra points on your Advantage card for every empty you return.Most Advent calendars are designed to have broad appeal, but I also assessed how useful each selection of products would be. For makeup, that meant looking for neutral, wearable shades, rather than wild fluorescent colours. For hair care, I looked for formulas that help condition and improve all hair, rather than a specific hair type. I also liked to see gentler skin care products that help with common skin concerns, such as dullness, hydration levels and barrier health, although I didn’t mind an occasional anti-ageing product or spot treatment as these also have a wide appeal.Testing 15 Advent calendars left me with more cosmetics and products than I could ever feasibly use. In instances where I wouldn’t or couldn’t use something from inside the calendars, I donated samples to theRedbridge Reach Outdomestic abuse service, where they could be given to women and young people seeking refuge. If you end up with products you won’t use, it’s always worth looking for a local beauty bank that will take donations or give items to friends and family.Here are the 10 beauty Advent calendars that came out on top in my tests.The best beauty Advent calendars in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest beautyAdvent calendar overall:Cult Beauty the Classic CurationView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£240 at Cult BeautyWith my original pick of the Space NK calendar out of stock, my next best pick is this equally bumper-size offering from Cult Beauty. With 34 products inside 25 drawers, this calendar has skincare favourites to help repair stressed-out winter skin, as well as a few standout makeup products to add to your kit.Why we love itIt’s beautiful to look at, and the recyclable packaging feels sturdy and luxurious. It comes with a solid selection of skincare that should help relieve dryness and plump up sensitive skin. That includes a Summer Fridays hydration mist, a Paula’s Choice barrier repair moisturiser and a Byoma Phyto-Mucin glow serum.Those looking for more targeted skincare will find the Elemis Pro-Collagen toning mist, a Medik8 C-Tetra advanced serum, and the spot-fighting Oil La La serum from Krave. All are useful when a spot pops up, or when your skin needs brightening up after a night on the fizz.For hair care you’ll find a scalp recovery serum from Philip Kingsley, a K18 Molecular Repair hair mask and Hair by Sam McKnight’s Love Me Do nourishing hair oil. Great for hair that’s been depleted by winter.This calendar doesn’t scrimp on makeup, either. Inside, you’ll find a powder blush duo from Patrick Ta, a blush from Saie and a Charlotte Tilbury beauty light wand. There’s also a mini By Terry Hyaluronic Hydra Powder, a translucent powder I recently fell in love with – it sets my makeup in place without drying out my skin.It’s a shame that …while most of the skincare in this calendar is good for sensitive and acne-prone skin, watch out for the Kate Somerville exfoliating mask – it’s highly potent, so it can cause irritation if you’re not careful.Number of products:34 (20 full size, 14 mini)Overall value:about £1,100Packaging:domestically recyclableBest value beauty Advent calendar:Lookfantastic beauty Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£105 at LookfantasticMany of the Advent calendars in this roundup justify their steep prices by including high numbers of full-size products, while the cheaper options tend to be mostly stocked with minis. The Lookfantastic calendar bucks this trend, offering 17 full-size products and 11 minis for less than half the price of the Cult Beauty calendar above.Why we love itInside the drawers, you’ll find a balance of indulgent skincare, body care essentials, universally useful makeup, hair care and accessories. Highlights include a Medik8 Hydr8 B5 Intense serum, which gently hydrates and plumps winter-stressed skin, and the Ren CleanSkincareRadiance eye cream, which helps minimise the appearance of dark circles – perfect for mornings when you’ve burned the candle at both ends.There is a 75ml Color Wow shampoo and conditioner set, as well as a mini hydrating, smoothing Wella hair mask that helps nourish stressed-out hair. Makeup-wise, there are three subtle pink-toned lip products from Mac, a full-size Revolution eyeshadow palette and a creamy Glow Hub blush stick. These shades are pigmented enough to work on all skin tones, and can be set in place using the full-size Iconic London Prep Set Blur setting spray.Among these beauty goodies, you’ll find a Sol de Janeiro perfume mist and a White Company candle. I also love that you get two towelling wristbands, which I use to stop water dripping down my arms when I cleanse my face – essential in winter if you want to stop any wet sleeve-induced meltdowns.It’s a shame that …much of the full-size skincare in this calendar is for improving hydration – you won’t find many targeted retinol or vitamin C products here. That said, most people can benefit from extra hydration in the colder months, so this isn’t a huge pitfall.Number of products:28 (17 full size, 11 mini)Overall value:£655Packaging:domestically recyclableBest for bath lovers:Lush refillable Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£205 at LushIf your favourite part of the day is bath time, or you’re hoping to buy an Advent calendar the whole family can enjoy, this colourful option from Lush is my pick. Lush releases a few calendars each year, but this refillable chest is my recommendation: it’s perfect for storing your Lush products, and can be refilled for less money (and packaging) when the brand releases its 2026 calendar next year.Why we love itLush is most known for its fun, freshly made bath bombs – this calendar comes with bombs and bubble bars. Some have sweet scents, others are spiced; all of them are vegan and cruelty-free. If you’re a Lush lover, you’ll have no trouble working your way through this haul.You’ll also get four festive shower gels, two body lotions – including my longtime favourite festive Lush scent, Yog Nog – two soaps, a perfume and a lip scrub. For cosy festive evenings, there are also Lush socks and a Christmas Eve scented candle – no prizes for guessing which door that is hiding behind.This year’s refillable calendar was designed in partnership with Artbox London, a charity that runs workshops for people with learning disabilities and neurodivergent artists. Artist Shruti Gadhvi, who designed this year’s box, took inspiration from the practice of meditation, positive affirmations and the flowers and colours she sees on her travels.It’s a shame that …it’s quite expensive and it’s difficult to calculate the overall value since 10 items are exclusive.Number of products:25Overall value:not statedPackaging:refillable or domestically recyclable (bar the ribbon, which can be reused)Best for essential makeup and skincare:Boots 24 Beauty Stars premium Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£150 at BootsBoots’ Advent calendar has a good range of full-size products from big-name brands, such as Drunk Elephant, Nars and Estée Lauder. It may not seem cheap at £150, but it’s filled with buzzy skincare products and makeup most beauty fanatics will want to try. The products inside are worth £612.50.Why we love itIt really looks the part, with a circus-themed chest design that opens to reveal individually wrapped goodies for every day until Christmas Eve. Despite its substantial design, it’s still fully recyclable.Highlights include a full-size viral Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide cream and an Estée Lauder cleansing gel. There’s also a mini-size Elemis cleansing balm – used together, these three make an effective, gentle evening skincare routine most people will love. You’ll also find crowd-pleaser fragrances from Sol de Janeiro and Floral Street.But it’s the makeup that really makes this calendar standout. There are seven full-size makeup products inside: an Iconic London face powder palette, a Fenty liquid lipstick, a Too Faced shimmery lip oil, a Mac lip liner, a Laneige lip balm, Nars light reflecting hydrating primer and a Milk Makeup mini highlighter (the latter of which stretches the meaning of “full size” a little). There are also minis of the Benefit Hoola bronzer, Mac Velvet Teddy lipstick and Laura Mercier loose-setting powder. All staples that will make great additions to any makeup bag.It’s a shame that …there are only two hair care products, so if this is what you’re after, opt for a different calendar.Number of products:25 (17 full size, 8 mini)Overall value:£612.50Packaging:domestically recyclableBest for product range:Next 25 days of beauty Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£95 at NextIn a world where many beauty Advent calendars cost hundreds of pounds, this more affordable calendar from Next is a breath of fresh air. Filled with 27 products, including hair care, skincare, nail care and makeup, it has a healthy dose of everything you need to upgrade your beauty routine.Why we love itRather than filling its doors with basic cleansers and moisturisers, this calendar features targeted skincare, such as a This Works brightening vitamin C serum, a Hello Sunday dark spot oil serum and BeautyPro’s retinol eye masks.

All of these are in neutral shades, so they should work with any skin tone and makeup collection.I also love that this calendar doesn’t forget about your nails. Inside, you’ll get an Opi nail lacquer in Bubble Bath and a Nails Inc repairing cuticle oil. The Nuxe multi-purpose dry oil is a particular highlight for me, adding a healthy glow to skin and hair. Throw in a body scrub, candle, perfume and more, and you’ve got a pretty perfect offering for the price.It’s a shame that …some of the skincare will be too niche. For example, if you don’t have dark spots, you’ll have little use for the dark spot oil serum. But the calendar has so much else to offer, it’s still a great buy.Number of products:27 (12 full size, 15 mini)Overall value:£385Packaging:domestically recyclableBestentry-level calendar:W7 Beauty Blast Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£19.95 at W7£19.95 at AmazonThis Advent calendar from W7 is staggeringly cheap compared with the others here. Inside, you’ll find 24 boxes, each filled with bestsellers from the W7 range, including seven full-size products and 19 minis.Why we love itGood beauty Advent calendars are generally pricey, but the products included in the W7 Advent calendar can rival some of the best in the business.All in, the product selection here is pretty useful for most people – I can’t see any makeup lovers struggling to include these in their routine. I particularly love the brand’s lip liners – you’ll get two in this calendar – and its H2O loose powder sets makeup without causing dryness. Also included is a mini Honolulu Sun Rays bronzer, famously similar to the Benefit Hoola bronzer. Another highlight is the Edgy mascara, which has a curved wand to help lift and curl the lashes as well as biotin, castor oil and vitamin B5 to condition the lashes.The travel-size eyeshadows, primers, lip balms, eye creams and liquid blushes are perfect if you’re just starting out with makeup and want to try new formulations and styles without remortgaging your home. For the cost, this calendar is perfect for those hoping to try out new, budget-friendly products.It’s a shame that …it’s mainly filled with travel minis, though this is perhaps expected given the price.Number of products:24 (7 full size, 17 mini)Overall value:about £50Packaging:domestically recyclableBest skincare Advent calendar:Elemis Wonders Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£225 at ElemisHigh-end skincare is notoriously expensive, and Elemis is no different. But the brand’s annual Advent calendar is stocked full of 26 of its bestsellers, so you can try the range before adding something to your routine.Why we love itThe selection in this calendar is a skincare fanatic’s dream, with a full-size Pro-Collagen Future Restore Serum worth £115alone, and a Pro-Collagen Marine Cream worth £98. In these two products, the calendar almost pays for itself.The Pro-Collagen collection is widely regarded as one of the best anti-ageing skincare lines out there. Its marine algae complex helps smooth fine lines and improve skin’s firmness and elasticity to reduce the appearance of the signs of ageing caused by declining levels of collagen. Alongside the two full-size products, the calendar also contains 13 minis from the Pro-collagen range.These include various products from Elemis’s other lines, such as the Superfood Glow Priming moisturiser and Dynamic resurfacing facial wash. There are also a few body care products to use, such as a shower cream and a body balm. You could either use these yourself or sacrifice them to sticky-fingered members of your family to keep them away from the precious skincare.It’s a shame that …there are only two full-size products included. The rest are travel size, so while this is perfect for testing new products, it doesn’t feel like as much of a saving as other calendars. Many of the products are focused on anti-ageing, which makes them unsuitable for teenagers and young adults.Number of products:26 2 full size, 24 mini)Overall value:£698Packaging:domestically recyclableThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianSentier Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£99 at SentierBest for:fragrance loversThis 12-day calendar (designed for the 12 days of Christmas, so not strictly Advent) from Sentier comes with a range of perfumes and candles to see you through the festive season. It’s beautifully designed and surprisingly well priced considering how long-lasting and potent the scents are.Sentier describes the box it comes in as “meticulously crafted”. It’s certainly the most distinctive calendar of the lot, with doors and drawers opening in unexpected directions to reveal what’s inside.In the box, you’ll get six 10ml alcohol-free scents in pretty glass bottles. In my experience, each scent was distinct, wearable and versatile enough to layer, making them perfect for popping in a handbag. You’ll also get six scented candles, each 60ml in size. I found that these wafted scent around my flat beautifully.It didn’t make the final cut because …there’s a soft foam included in the bottom of each drawer, to keep the candle safe. This isn’t recyclable, despite the box being mainly made from card.Number of products:12;overall value:£516;packaging:not fully recyclableBamford ultimate Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£300 at BamfordBest for:self-care and wellbeingIf you’re into baths and self-care rituals but have more refined taste (and a higher budget) than Lush, this celestial-themed Advent calendar from Bamford is a more indulgent option. It comes with a whole host of Bamford favourites, including 13 full-size products and 11 minis to help you wind down during the hectic festive period.In the full-size collection, you’ll find the brand’s bestselling perfume mist, two candles, body oil, bath oil and relaxing bath salts. In mini-size, you’ll find a range of body washes, lotions and hair care – less environmentally friendly perhaps, but handy to take on your travels over Christmas.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s very expensive. And its ratio of full-size to mini products could be better, considering the price.Number of products:24 (13 full size, 11 mini);overall value:about £600;packaging:domestically recyclableDiptyque Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£399 at DiptyqueBest for:luxury fragranceDiptyque is the first brand that comes to mind when I think of luxury fragrance, and its 2025 Advent calendar has a huge selection of its bestselling fragrances packed in. That’s both mini and full-size candles, seven different perfumes, a hand cream, an oil and soaps to make your festive season smell great.It’s also one of the most beautiful designs I’ve tried out this year, with a book-shaped box that opens to reveal 25 smaller boxes adorned with book illustrations and the signature Diptyque cat. It will look great surrounded by Christmas decorations throughout December, though its good looks come at a luxury price point.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive, with more reasonably priced competition, and there’s no indication of the calendar’s overall value. That said, perfume fans with deep pockets will love it.Number of products:25;overall value:not stated;packaging:about 90% recyclable; only one drawer has polystyrene in itWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianAre beauty Advent calendars worth it?This depends. If your beauty routine is in need of a refresh and you want to try lots of new products, beauty Advent calendars allow you to do that for a reduced price.Case in point: the Cult Beauty listed above has 34 products with a total value of £1,100. It costs £240, so in theory saves you £860.However, if you have a set beauty routine that works, then the mixed calendars might not be worth it. In this case, a scent-based or body-care Advent calendar may be more suitable as the products are less specific; a series of treats to enjoy rather than a whole new routine.How much should you expect to spend?Beauty Advent calendars can cost anything from £20 to £500 (or more), so there’s something to suit every budget. At the lower end of the scale, you can expect to find calendars from high-street brands, often with mini-size products inside. The packaging on these calendars is likely to be flimsier.Move up to the £100-£200 price range and you can dip your toes into high-end brand calendars, or the department store Advent calendars, which contain a mix of bestselling products from a range of brands. The latter might work best if you’re buying a calendar as a gift, especially if you don’t know which brands the recipient likes best.At the top end of the scale, you’ll find beauty Advent calendars from exclusive high-end brands, usually containing mostly full-size products. Packaging for these calendars is typically more sculptural and eye-catching, but they also come with a high price tag of more than £200.Why are beauty Advent calendars released so early?Planning, organising and launching an Advent calendar takes a long time. Think about how many products are included in the major beauty retailers’ calendars. Then think about how much organisation it takes to coordinate with each brand on products to fit in each Advent calendar window. Add on to that marketing materials and imagery, and you’ve got a project that starts production almost as soon as the new year hits.Typically, brands release their calendars so early because it allows them to anticipate how much stock they need to order. As I’m writing this piece in August, many have already opened their waitlists, which helps them gauge how much interest there is in the calendar before it drops. When calendars go on sale in the autumn, it’s usually the case that when stock sells out, it’s gone for good.Sarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who can’t quite believe she gets to spend her days reviewing beauty products.

And then, in the case of one particular book, ordering another copy. Ten out, one in: not terrible.The book I (re)ordered wasBeaneaters and Bread Soup, by Lori de Mori and the photographer Jason Lowe. Gathered over decades of living just outside Florence, the book is a collection of wonderful, practical Tuscan recipes, and also tells a story of Tuscan food through portraits of photogenic local artisans: a chestnut grower, a bee keeper, a man who makes knives … I would mention more if I could find the book, which I suspect was borrowed and never returned – you know who you are! (Unless I have got this wrong and it is behind the bookcase.)One recipe I don’t need to wait for, though, is Lori’ssformato, which I have been making on and off for years. The word sformato means something taken out of a form, and it’s an umbrella term used to describe a great number of bakes. Lori’s consists of a layer of well-seasoned spinach covered with a duvet ofbesciamella(bechamel) seasoned with parmesan, and it inspired this week’s recipe, which is another good example of how so much cooking is simply repetitive behaviour seasoned with fresh thoughts.The fresh thoughts here are from a summer meal at a restaurant near Arezzo, where, as a vegetarian option, they baked leeks in individual terracotta dishes, poured over bechamel enriched with lots of cheese, then flashed the dishes under a grill. When I complimented the owner on the good idea, she mentioned that it works with spinach, too, and that you could also snuggle a few hard-boiled eggs into the vegetables for a more complete meal.One thing to note about this dish is that you want to cut the leeks into long lengths, then arrange them in a buttered dish – the effect is a bit like a cluster of standing logs or tree stumps. The leeks are then roasted alone to begin with, until very tender, and then the hard-boiled egg are added. If the bechamel is freshly made, the whole thing will need only five or so minutes in a hot oven, or under a grill.This is a dish that demands a salad, I think, with a vinegary dressing.Baked leek and egg gratinServes4 - 64 large leeks6 eggs50gbutter, plus extra for greasingOlive oil50g plain flour500mlwhole milkSalt and black pepperNutmeg, freshly grated, to taste50gparmesan, or cheddar or gruyereTrim the roots of the leeks, pull away and discard any damaged, tough or wayward leaves, then rinse the leeks in cold water as best you can without splitting them. Cut the leeks into 4cm-long logs and rinse again if any have dirt hidden in the exposed layers (again, make sure they don’t fall apart). Hard boil the eggs (I do this for eight minutes), then drain and peel.Arrange the leeks like standing logs in a buttered, roughly 25cm baking dish, packing them in quite closely. Spoon over five tablespoons of olive oil and six teaspoons of water, then cover the dish with foil and bake at 200C (180C)/390F/gas 6 for 30 minutes. Lift off the foil and bake for another 10 minutes, by which time the leeks should be tender and just a little golden. Pull the dish from the oven and keep warm.Melt the butter in a heavy-based pan, then, as soon as it starts to foam, whisk in the flour until it forms a paste and pull off the heat. Add a little of the milk, whisk to a smooth paste, then return the pan to the heat and add the remaining milk in a steady stream, whisking continuously, until it almost boils Season with salt, nutmeg and black pepper to taste, then lower the heat and simmer, stirring and whisking often, for about 10 minutes, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in the cheese until melted and incorporated.Cut the hard-boiled eggs in half, then nestle them in between the baked leeks. Pour the bechamel over the top, then finish in a hot oven or under the grill until the top bubbles.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodVegetablesEggsCheeseMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

You decide who is talking rubbishFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 16 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 11.53 EDTShareThe prosecution: MohammedIf the bins are left out for ages, our neighboursdon’t like it and random people chuck rubbish inI’ve known Ben and Roisin since university. We all live together now and get on, but there’s one issue that keeps coming up: the bins.We live in a split-level maisonette, and have an unspoken system with our upstairs neighbours, a couple in their 40s who’ve lived here longer than any of us. We share a back garden and two wheelie bins. They put the bins in front of our building before collection day, and I bring them back in. That’s the deal, and it’s worked for years.But when I’m away working – I do event rigging, so I’m often gone for stretches – Ben and Roisin let the whole system fall apart. They don’t bring the bins back in, which causes friction with the neighbours. Sometimes, they don’t even take our rubbish out on time, so it builds up as we only get our bins collected every two weeks.Our neighbours get annoyed and I don’t blame them. They’ve moved the bins back themselves a few times, but they shouldn’t have to. Roisin and Ben need to stick to the unspoken rules. They walk past the bins, strewn all over the road, on their way to work. It doesn’t seem to bother them. But when our bins are left out front, random people start chucking their rubbish in. By the time we want to use them, they’re already half-full with other people’s dog poo and takeaway cartons.The system works when I’m around because I make the effort. When I’m gone, the whole thing goes Pete TongRoisin doesn’t really deal with the bins. She says it’s a “man’s job”, so I talk to Ben more about this. However, he often misses the collection as he puts the rubbish out late, after the truck’s been. Then it sits in the big bins and starts to smell. In the summer, the smells and the flies were a big problem. Our neighbours once asked me if we could be more considerate and not fill the bins up after missing the collection, which is never my fault.I think it’s reasonable to want to keep the peace with our neighbours. They’re not being petty, they just want a tidy street. The system works when I’m around because I make the effort. When I’m away, the whole thing goes Pete Tong. Ben needs to step up and take the bins in on time.The defence: BenRubbish belongs in the bin, and bins belong in the street. Mo is making a fussover nothingMo loves to talk about this bin “system” like it’s a sacred law, but they’re bins; they belong in the street and they belong to the council. We don’t need to get into a tizz about all this.If the bins stay out a bit longer, I don’t see why that’s such a scandal. Every street has bins sitting around. Mo says the neighbours give him dirty looks, but who cares? He made himself the go-between with them, I didn’t. I don’t need to build my life around whether a couple in their 40s think I’ve pulled a wheelie bin back fast enough. If it bothers them so much, they can move the bins themselves.Mo and Roisin have lived together since uni, and I moved in a year ago. I am tidy and respectful, but I work in finance and don’t have the time to worry about the bins. If strangers chuck rubbish in our bin, who cares? That’s what bins are for. Better for it to be in there than dumped on the pavement.Mo acts like my behaviour is a personal attack, but the bins get emptied every two weeks anyway. When our neighbour said something to him about not letting our rubbish sit in the bins for weeks, Mo apologised. I wouldn’t have, because it’s not illegal. Mo cares too much what people think.They’re just bins. If they sit out for an extra day or two, life goes onI’m not deliberately sabotaging collections, but as the newest flatmate I’m not used to the schedule yet. If I walk past the bins and don’t put them back in our garden, it’s not deliberate – I’m just preoccupied. As Roisin refuses to touch the bin, the responsibility falls on me when Mo is away, and I just forget. If the rubbish waits until the next round, I don’t think it’s a very big deal.What Mo really cares about is appearances: he likes looking like a good boy to our neighbours and our landlord. Fair enough, that’s his thing, but I don’t think that should become such a burden. If I take the rubbish out a week late, I shouldn’t be made to feel bad – at least I’m taking it out.In my view, Mo is overreacting. He’s a good flatmate, but at the end of the day, they’re just bins. If they sit out for an extra day or two, life goes on.The jury of Guardian readersWhose argument will you bin?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We are all busy but that doesn’t mean we’re “too important” to put the bins out. Maybe a schedule would help? Mo needs to get his flatmates into a routine, so it’s not such a shock when he’s away and they have to put the bins out for themselves.Louise, 51If everyone behaved like Ben, our neighbourhoods would be strewn with bins. Mo’s request for occasional cover for bin duties is not unreasonable. Living in split maisonettes requires this type of cooperation and compromise, and is neighbourly and low effort.Ade, 38Ben is being a tad inconsiderate. Taking the bins out doesn’t take long enough for working in finance to be a valid excuse, and he could make more of an effort. Roisin should step up too.Olivia, 21Living with others means sharing the load even when it’s not convenient. The bin system contributes to a peaceful and harmonious relationship with the neighbours, and to general tidiness and hygiene. Ben needs to step up instead of just enjoying the benefits of Mo’s efforts.Catherine, 41It seems such a minor price to pay for good relations with close neighbours. I’d have loved to have heard from Roisin, too, as all three could do with a discussion about men’s and women’s jobs in the 21st century.

I’m with Loreto to discover the food and wine culture of Spain’s Burgos province, a high-altitude area ringed by distant mountains. In summer the days are hot, and at night temperatures plummet. To thrive in these extremes, the food, the wine, and even perhaps the people, are robust and straight-talking.I’m staying deep in wine country at the ruralPosada de Pradoray, built as a hunting lodge for the Duke of Lerma in 1601. The thick stone walls, dark polished wood and heavy doors leading to simple rooms with vineyard views suggest little has changed in this landscape for centuries. Burgos is part of the Ribera del Duero wine region which stretches for 71 miles following the Duero River through the provinces of Burgos, Segovia, Soria and Valladolid.Map of northern Spain including the Ribera del Duero wine regionSince the appellation was recognised in 1982 the region has seen huge changes, with the number of wineries increasing from nine to more than 300. Now, there’s awine routeto help explore villages, wineries, restaurants and visitor experiences across the region, with plenty of sampling. My hotel is just outside Aranda de Duero, the main town in the region (population 33,000), 62 miles east of Valladolid and 102 miles north of Madrid. From here I’m following the river on day trips to get a taste of what’s on offer.View image in fullscreenAilsa Sheldon at Bodegas PortiaBodegas Portiais built on the edge of the tiny town of Gumiel de Izán, eight miles (13km) north of Aranda. Designed by Norman Foster, it’s one of the new wave of wineries in the region, with a futuristic trefoil shape, like a spaceship that’s landed in these sun-scorched fields. It’s built partly underground to meld into the landscape but also in recognition of the area’s unique winemaking traditions.Later, I meet the mayor of Gumiel de Izán, Jesús Briones, at his home – a tour with Loreto opens many doors, she knows everyone. “You’ve seen the wine cathedral [as local people refer to Portia], now see the caves,” he says. Jesús invites us into his garage from which, between tins of paint and boxes of faded Christmas decorations, stone steps twist underground. A single bulb illuminates a rough hewn cave full of barrels, dating back hundreds of years. Traditionally, wine in this region was made and stored in deep, hand-dug caves where the temperatures are stable.Jesús’s basement isn’t unusual: underneath these streets is a warren of caves, some used, some forgotten. Down here glasses are eschewed in favour of aporrón, a glass jug with a long, narrow spout designed for sharing wine. To drink from it is a leap of faith, pouring wine above your mouth, avoiding speckling your face and clothes with crimson Tempranillo and without the porrón touching your lips. I manage it (mostly).View image in fullscreenWine cellars at Moradillo de Roa.Photograph: Maria Galan/AlamyGumiel de Izán has seen a recent uptick in visitors thanks to a National Geographic article that notedvisual similaritiesbetween the baroque facade of the town’s Iglesia de Santa Maria, and “the treasury” rock-cut tomb in Petra, Jordan. Gazing up at the intricate sandstone carvings from the village square, I’d say here’s definitely a resemblance, and it’s helped to put the town on the map. “Anything that brings visitors,” says Jesús. “We need reasons for young people to stay.”‘It’s a real treasure’: Petra lookalike church draws crowds to Spanish townRead moreAtNabalwinery a few miles along the road I meet one young person who’s done just that: Luz Briones studied translation but became fascinated by wine in her early 20s. She leads us through vineyards ranging from 30 years old to more than a century. “We believe in the power of time,” Luz says. “Time in vineyards, time in barrels, time in bottles.” Grapes have to work hard here, developing thick skins to cope with temperature fluctuations and creating rich, tannic wines. In the storeroom, Benedictine chanting is played to the maturing barrels, an acknowledgment of centuries of wine-making by monks. Luz says security guards report lights and music turning on when the building is empty and shows us a large stain that has appeared on the wall resembling, if you squint, a monk drinking wine. The angels’ share perhaps?In summer fields of lavender and sunflowers create a colourful patchwork with the green of the grapesWe travel downstream, the Duero snaking just out of sight, its presence marked by rippling valleys covered in vines, all benefiting from the river’s proximity. Early in the year the land looks barren, with spiky bare vines and cracked red earth, but in summer fields of lavender and sunflowers create a colourful patchwork with the green of the grapes. In the village of Moradillo de Roa, south of Aranda, we meet Paola González Ortiz carrying a porrón. She’s part of a young team offering tours of a tiny winery museum, demonstrating the heavy labour and huge weights once needed to crush grapes. The village is famed for its grassy hillocks full of wine cellar entrances, often compared to Tolkien’s The Shire. Ducking low, I follow Paola down winding steps into the hillside (being Hobbit height would help). As we share wine from the porrón, a little light filtering through the air vents, Paola says she hopes increased tourism, whether for food and wine or scenic lookalikes, will help create more year-round jobs here. Moradillo de Roa has 157 wine cellars, and a population of 162. To attract young people, the village has started hosting porrón singles nights in the town square.View image in fullscreenIglesia de Santa Maria in the village of Gumiel de Izán.Photograph: Blanca Saenz de Castillo/AlamyI end my tour back in Aranda, with a final wine cellar, this one beneathDon Carlos wine shop. Through a dynamic tasting, Cristina López Nuñez tells stories of wine and winemakers, and why the region needs both traditions and youthful innovation. “It’s like wine. Younger grapes have more energy but fewer stories like children,” she says. “The older grapes have less energy but much better stories, like older people. The old vines with deep roots give complexity, the younger vines with shallow roots are juicy. We need both.”At dusk, everything changes as the bars switch from coffee to wineWhen I emerge back above ground, the sleepy town has transformed. Before I saw only old men sipping coffee and smoking at wine-barrel tables, and a gaggle of children chasing a football past the imposing gothic churches. At dusk, everything changes as the bars switch from coffee to wine. “We never entertain at home,” says Loreto. “Why would we?”AtEl Lagar de Isilla, the bar fills with people of all ages in office attire, hi-vis jackets, or dressed for a night out. We feast on bechamel-topped salt cod, gildas with fat olives and anchovies, and octopus cooked with potatoes and sweet paprika. The wine is cheap and delicious, straight from the restaurant’s own vineyard, and the atmosphere is lively. Loreto is satisfied: “I told you, it’s about eating and drinking – and who you share it with.” I can drink to that.The trip was provided by theRibera del Duero Wine Route.

Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianRachel Williams says domestic violence is a ‘national emergency’. After she survived her ex’s final attack, her traumatised teenage son took his own life, and she began campaigning to end the terrible cycle of abuseByEmma RussellThu 16 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 03.28 EDTShareIt was a sunny Friday in August when Rachel Williams arrived at the hair salon where she worked in Newport,Wales. As she was shuffling clients around, she remembers “looking at the shop door or window and thinking something was obscuring the sunlight”. She quickly recognised her ex-husband Darren’s 6ft 7in frame, and instinctively ran towards him as he pulled a sawn-off shotgun out of his black duffel bag.She fought him for the gun and was soon on the floor beside a woman in her 90s called Connie, who was shouting: “Go on, get out of here, get out of here.” (“She was in the war, so made of steel.”) Rachel tried to pull a table across herself for protection but Darren kicked it away. Instead, she rolled into the foetal position, pulling her knees up under her chin. “He stood four feet away from me, told me he loved me, and pulled the trigger. My left leg took the first shot and I can remember it wasn’t a pain, it was a force.”Rachel could smell the gunpowder and looked down at her jeans where there was a gaping hole. “I remember looking and thinking, ‘Oh my God, he’s shot me.’ And then I felt a blast to the right of me, and that clearly missed my head.” She grabbed the gun with “supernatural strength”, and clung on as he stamped all over her head and punched her back. “My left ear had to be slit seven times to get rid of a huge cauliflower ear. I had a bruise from a black eye that travelled all the way down my neck and landed on my shoulder and collarbone. He battered me and then he was gone.”View image in fullscreenRachel in hospital after the shooting.Photograph: Courtesy of Rachel WilliamsThe hours that followed are a morphine-filled blur. The local vet came to help, followed by an ambulance and the police. Soon, she was at hospital getting treatment for her shattered shin and knee, surrounded by armed police to protect her. But by 7pm she was told that they had found Darren dead in a localwoodland; he had killed himself. “The relief,” she says. “I wasn’t even thinking about my leg.”Rachel met Darren in March 1993, through a neighbour, when she was a 21-year-old single mum to Josh, who was two. Darren was witty and made her laugh. It started with a coffee but quickly became serious and, in hindsight, she knows he “love-bombed” her.“When you work in the sector and you see the eight stages of domestic abuse or the homicide timeline, you can see how quickly perpetrators will escalate moving in,” says Rachel, who foundedSUTDA(Stand Up to Domestic Abuse) in January 2021, a decade after she was attacked. “Darren was living with me within 12 months, and not long after that I was pregnant with Jack. It’s all about that power and control and getting the victim to where they want them.”Every day you’re strategically thinking, as soon as you open your eyes, ‘How am I going to pacify my perpetrator today?’The honeymoon period didn’t last long before Darren’s abuse began. He used to say: “Today I’m going to be Daniel, which is the nice side of me,” says Rachel. “Almost a bit like Jekyll and Hyde.” He quickly started belittling Rachel with comments about her being a single mother when they met, saying things like: “I found you in the gutter.” After she gave birth to Jack, he bought her a car so she could run errands, and she remembers finding it odd when he said the reason was: “I don’t want blokes eyeballing you when you’re walking around with a pushchair.”The first time she remembers fearing for her life was after an argument when she was seven months pregnant. Darren, who was “huge” and “weighed about 18 stone”, turned physically violent. She can’t remember what had angered him, but he threw an apple at her, then followed her upstairs where she was cowering beside the wardrobe. “He lifted me off the floor by my throat and said he only let me go because my lips turned blue,” says Rachel.“People might think, ‘Why didn’t she leave then?’” she says. “But when you’ve got somebody who is one of the most manipulative people you will ever meet, falling to the floor and crying like a baby and begging for forgiveness, knowing all the stuff in his life, you just think you can fix them and try to work with them. I was already a single mum and I didn’t want to be a single parent of two children by two different fathers,” she adds, feeling that she had to try to make it work.View image in fullscreen‘Nobody was confirming this is a dangerous pattern of behaviour’ … Rachel with Darren.Photograph: Courtesy of Rachel WilliamsThe next 18 years were all about surviving within a cycle of abuse. “Every day you’re strategically thinking, as soon as you open your eyes, ‘How am I going to pacify my perpetrator today?’ It’s all about keeping a happy home harmonious, without any reason for an outburst. It is the walking on eggshells; you’re constantly assessing things.”Rachel would feel the tension rising before an assault, which could range from him spitting in her face to strangulation, punching the back of her head and ramming his head into hers to push her against the wall. One of his favourite things to do was to place his massive hands on her face and crush it. There were a couple of silent 999 calls, where she pressed 55 to transfer the call to the police without her speaking, leading them to her location. But when the police showed up, Darren would stand behind her as they asked if everything was all right. Next would come the remorse, which would last about a week. “There was always a bouquet of flowers and chocolates and apologies,” she says: he was playing with her head. Rachel and Darren got married on 29 December 2005.Darren, who was a bouncer, was injecting steroids and taking a combination of antidepressants and sleeping tablets that Rachel thinks probably exacerbated his temper, but alcohol and drugs weren’t what triggered the abuse, which was only directed at her. “Abuse is a choice; it is done with free will,” she says.View image in fullscreenRachel with her son Jack.Photograph: Courtesy of Rachel WilliamsHe often let his temper bubble up in public: “He was a law unto himself,” she says. Rachel’s sister saw Darren pin her up against the burger vanat Newport Docks where Rachel sometimes worked with her sister, after she arrived a little late from collecting bread rolls. “He flipped all the rolls in the air. He threw the great big diesel generator down the road. There was one guy who said to my sister: ‘That man is an animal and I will never come back here again,’” she says.Another time, her neighbour asked her friend Sue whether she’d heard from Rachel one day. “I heard that Darren was dragging that wheelie bin down the steps at 2am,” he told her. “Clearly, he thought I was in the wheelie bin,” says Rachel.But no one said anything to Darren, who was “a force to be reckoned with” and had “fingers in pies and I never knew what he was up to,” she says. “His bedtime reading was Donnie Brasco, Al Capone, the Krays.”It was about 7.30am on 9 July 2011 when Rachel finally reached her limit. She had got into an argument with Darren the night before, after he had arrived home in the early hours of the morning, and she had been on her way out of the house to style hair for a wedding. He strangled her downstairs by the kitchen door so hard she squealed “like a pig”. It woke up the children, who were 20 and 16 respectively. Josh, the eldest, came running down the stairs doing a silent 999 call, while Jack held a baseball bat.“When he saw the kids, he let go, then he started crying and everything else – they like to become the victim.” After a while the kids went to bed, but Darren dragged Rachel up the stairs and threatened to slit his own wrists. Jack came back into the room as Darren scrambled through a drawer of hunting knives, and watched him slash his skin superficially. That was the moment she knew – “I have got to get out of this,” says Rachel.On average, victims experience50 incidentsof abuse and takeseven failed attemptsto leave before they go for good. Luckily, Rachel had always worked: she cleaned the doctor’s surgery before her day started, she had a mobile hairdressing business, and did shifts at a salon. She didn’t have savings but knew she would cope, and had already thought about getting a flat. She has always been close to her mum, and had a small but close-knit circle of friends to rely on. “At the end of the day, it’s great having a network,” she says, “but ultimately it’s on the victim-slash-survivor that’s got to say, ‘Right, I’m going to do this.’” At the point of leaving, though, “you just have tunnel vision”.My son clearly felt shame from it. That’s the problem with domestic violence – it’s a ripple effectBut leaving still felt insurmountable. “At one point, I did think the only way out was suicide.” She drove down to Amroth Beach, “but something came over me where I just thought: I am not taking my life because of him.” Darren had always said to her: “There’s only one way out and that’s in a wooden box,” and she didn’t want to give him the satisfaction.A few days later, she had a solicitors appointment and filed for divorce. She went to the police station and gave a historical statement, in which she disclosed the most recent strangulation. Darren was charged with common assault. The sentence for that is no more than six months in prison, but more often than not, it is suspended or a fine. “This is why I pushed for non-fatal strangulation,” says Rachel, who petitioned to have it added to the Domestic Violence Act of 2021. “He may as well have slapped me in the face or spat.”Rachel wants the courts to do more when it comes to charging perpetrators: “If that was done to a stranger in the street, they would have probably had the five years it can carry,” she says. In the domestic abuse setting, strangulation is most often carried out as an act of “power and control. The perpetrator will grab you by the throat, put pressure on – you only need the pressure of a handshake to kill somebody.”Professor Catherine White, whose research was used as evidence to change the law regarding non-fatal strangulation, says it restricts oxygen to the brain and can cause internal bleeding so that victims can die a few days later. It is thought to be the second biggest cause of stroke inwomen under 40. And women who have been strangled, throttled or choked areseven timesmore likely to be a victim of homicide.Darren was given a restraining order that meant he wasn’t allowed to come within three miles of the marital home. However, he continued to use the gym nearby. He started stalking Rachel: sitting outside her place of work in his Land Rover and staring at her for half an hour. “I’d phone the police and say, ‘He’s outside again,’ and they’d ask if he was doing anything.” It made her feel like a nuisance. “Nobody was confirming this is a dangerous pattern of behaviour,” says Rachel.The day before the shooting, all the bail restrictions were lifted by a lay magistrate, even though he had made threats to kill, had a conviction for firearms, and was a serial perpetrator. The police themselves came to warn her, and offered to install a panic room in her house. They added two metal brackets and a metal bar to her doors in case he came to the home.View image in fullscreenRachel: ‘We have a criminal justice system that is broken, shattered. It needs to be started again.’Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The GuardianThe horror didn’t end with Darren shooting her in the salon that summer’s day. Once Rachel was discharged from hospital in September, her 16-year-old son Jack took his life. They had been very close: “He was like my shadow,” she says. But he had spiralled after his mother’s attempted murder and his father’s death. He had gone to the salon to apologise for his father’s actions, and was living with Darren’s family.He became overwhelmed. “Sixteen is a really impressionable age with his hormones and everything else,” she says. “He clearly felt shame from it.” That’s the problem with domestic violence, she adds: “It’s a ripple effect.”For the last decade, Rachel has campaigned tirelessly to end domestic abuse, which she describes as “a national emergency”. She hopes to set up The House that Jack Built, a children and young person’s refuge, in memory of her son. “We should be training everybody around domestic abuse and violence,” she says, teaching young boys and girls about what a healthy relationship is. She wants restraining orders to be taken seriously and see perpetrators face repercussions for their abuse. “We have a criminal justice system that is broken, shattered. It needs to be started again.”Rachel had to deal with the emotional torture of losing her son, as well as a tremendous amount of physical pain as a result of the abuse she faced. Her house had to be fitted with a commode and a new toilet seat to help during her recovery, but when her mum suggested putting in a stairlift as well, Rachel told her not to dare: “I will get up those stairs,” she said, “if I’ve got to go up on my ass.” Her mindset was: “I’m not staying like that.”Rachel’s attitude to dating was the same. She met her new husband Mike in November, the year she was shot, and he’s been the rock that she needed. “My attitude was, I’m not going to let someone ruin the rest of my life,” she says.In the UK,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123 and thedomestic abuse helplineis 0808 2000 247.

        "Content": "Composite: Guardian Design/AP/Getty Images/AlamyEconomic insecurity, race riots, incendiary media … Claude McKay was one of the few Black journalists covering a turbulent period that sounds all too familiar to us todayByYvonne SinghThu 16 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 11.49 EDTShareThere was no greater vantage point to see America burn than the Pennsylvania railroad. Working in the summer of 1919 as a dining car waiter, Claude McKay was so fearful that he had resorted to travelling with a revolver secreted in his starched white jacket. During this volatile time, which became known as the US’s Red Summer, a wave of racial violence engulfed the country.In a situation replicated across the western world, hundreds of thousands of first world war veterans had returned home and were now looking for work. Among them were Black troops who had fought for the allied powers and hoped that they would be awarded equal rights in return for their service. It was not to be.Competition for labour and jobs would reveal ugly prejudices and trigger a prolonged spell of rioting and lynching across the US. Between April and November 1919, hundreds of people – most of them Black Americans – were killed and thousands injured. McKay, a 28-year-old Jamaican immigrant and aspiring poet, was shaken by the violence. “It was the first time I had ever come face to face with such manifest, implacable hate of my race, and my feelings were indescribable,” he later said. “I had heard of prejudice in America but never dreamed of it being so intensely bitter.”The experience would prove formative to his writing. During the Red Summer riots, he wrote the impassioned sonnetIf We Must Die. It was published in 1919 by the New York-based leftist publication the Liberator, which had been founded by Max Eastman and his sister, Crystal. The powerful verse, acknowledged by one contemporary as “the Marseillaise of the American Negro”, concluded with the lines, “Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack / Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!” It established McKay, who was living in Harlem at the time, as a literary talent and after it was reprinted in the major US Black newspapers and magazines of the time, McKay was lauded as “a poet of his people”.The publication of If We Must Diemarked the start of a lifelong collaboration between McKay and the Eastman siblings: the two would not just edit, publish and promote him, they would also provide him with financial support. Publication, however, brought unwelcome attention from the Justice Department’s committee investigating African American radicalism and sedition, which viewed the poem as inflammatory.By the end of the summer, McKay had left his job on the railroad and started work in a factory in Manhattan, where he joined the revolutionary Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) labour union. It is widely thought that pressure from the Justice Department led to McKay’s decision to leave the US in September 1919 and travel to the UK. However, he later stated that the spur was the offer from some of his literary admirers of an all-expenses trip, as well as his childhood desire to visit his “true cultural homeland”.McKay discovered that reality did not match his ideal of “literary England”. He was disturbed to find that racial violence had followed him across the Atlantic. By the autumn of 1919, riots had taken place in London, Liverpool, Cardiff, Manchester and Hull. Five people were killed, dozens injured and at least 250 arrested. Further clashes took place in 1920 and 1921, triggered by competition for jobs and housing, but also by white hostility to mixed relationships. A Cardiff city police report stated: “There can be no doubt that the aggressors have been those belonging to the white race.”According to the historian Jacqueline Jenkinson, the UK riots of 1919 emerged from the scorched earth of war: “At a time of stress, when xenophobia had become almost a way of life after over four years of constant German and anti-alien propaganda, those deemed ‘foreign’ by virtue of dark skin pigmentation were identified as legitimate targets for postwar grievances.”International seamen were drawn to Britain’s ports by the imperial trade in coal and other goods. By the late 19th century, estimates the author Stephen Bourne, Britain’s non-white population was at least 10,000 in an overall population of 45 million, with the largest communities concentrated in ports such as London’s Docklands, Cardiff, Hull and Liverpool. Their presence had not gone unnoticed. In Cardiff, just before the outbreak of the first world war, a retired sea captain carried out a protracted campaign against foreign-born seamen in his news sheet the Maritime Review. One of his cartoons has John Bull – the personification of Englishness – dangling off the edge of a cliff. A character with unruly hair and earrings clings on to his ankles. “If I don’t kick this fellow off I’m done for,” says Bull.During the war, these mixed communities grew, as seaports became home to Africans, West Indians, Indians, Chinese, Malaysians and Arabs who had staffed British ships during the conflict. But postwar competition for jobs led to discrimination (unions would bar seamen of colour from staffing British merchant ships) and rioting on the docks, which spilled over into attacks on boarding lodges and businesses occupied by non-white citizens. Economic conditions were dire: the cost of basics, such as food and clothing, tripled between the start and end of the war. For the wageless, non-whites were a convenient scapegoat.Some of the worst rioting was in Liverpool, where mobs reached up to 10,000-strong and more than 700 non-white people were forced to seek police protection in Bridewell, the central lockup. After a rash of fights between sailors of all nationalities, the local Globe newspaper reported that a young Black man was pushed into the sea and a crowd of white dock-workers “threw bricks at him until he sank for the last time”. The Liverpool Echo supplied a few more details: the drowned man was Charles Wootton, a Royal Navy serviceman. A police detective had tried to rescue him, but as he climbed down a ship’s rope, a stone thrown from the middle of the crowd struck Wootton on the head and he sank beneath the water. There were no arrests.View image in fullscreenA black man addressing a crowd in the Tiger Bay district of Cardiff, during the 1919 race riots.Photograph: PDMcKay began to think that things were as bad in England as they were in the US. Difficulties finding accommodation in London led to him living in a “hideous little gutter street near the Angel”; pubs would often refuse him service; and he would regularly receive verbal and even physical abuse.McKay searched for a literary scene similar to that he had left in Harlem, and in time he came across a club for non-white soldiers in London’s Drury Lane. Here he met “a few coloured Americans, East Indians and Egyptians”, who would tell him about racism in the British army and on the streets of London during the Armistice. He enjoyed attending the spit-and-sawdust boxing matches staged nearby. He acquainted his new friends with US journals the Crisis, the Messenger and the Negro World. Hubert Harrison, the editor of the Negro World, who knew McKay from Harlem, asked him to contribute a series on London life. McKay wrote about the soldiers’ club, but incurred the wrath of its matron after describing her “patronising white maternal attitude towards her coloured charges”.With Drury Lane out of bounds, McKay sought another refuge. Frank Harris, the Irish editor of Pearson’s Magazine, had supplied him with several letters of introduction, including one to George Bernard Shaw who, after a memorable evening at his house in Adelphi Terrace, had helped McKay get a reader’s ticket for the British Museum. The other letters led him to the International Socialist Club (ISC) in London. There he met fellow leftwing intellectuals, including George Lansbury, editor of the Daily Herald. McKay found the ISC “full of excitement with its dogmatists and doctrinaires of radical left ideas: socialists, communists, anarchists, syndicalists, one-big-unionists and trade unionists, soap-boxers, poetasters, scribblers, editors of little radical sheets which flourish in London.”At this time, he had a fortuitous encounter with Sylvia Pankhurst, editor of the Workers’ Dreadnought, a leading weekly paper of the radical progressive left, whose offices were in Bow, in the heart of London’s East End. Pankhurst had established the Dreadnought in March 1914. The paper’s original title, the Woman’s Dreadnought, emphasised her suffragette credentials but in July 1917, Pankhurst took the eight-page newspaper in a new direction, with a title that reflected its radical content. Distributed in the East End, it boasted a weekly circulation of 20,000. With its mixture of news, global analysis, first-person accounts of working-class life (whether that be as a soldier or as a stevedore) and a smattering of poetry, the Dreadnought promoted working-class and feminist voices at a time when such forums were wanting. “I wanted the paper to be as far as possible written from life,” Pankhurst once stated. “No dry arguments, but a vivid presentment of things as they are, arguing always from the particular, with all its human features, to the general principle.”Sylvia Pankhurst already knew of McKay. She was good friends with the Eastmans, founders of the Liberator inNew York, and in September 1919, a month before they met in person, she had republished a series of his poems, including If We Must Die, in the Dreadnought under the title A Negro Poet, emphasising that McKay was a dining car waiter when he wrote them.McKay described Pankhurst as “a plain little Queen Victoria-sized woman with plenty of long unruly bronze-like hair … her eyes were fiery, even a little fanatic, with a glint of shrewdness … And in the labour movement she was always jabbing her hat pin into the hides of the smug and slack labour leaders … And wherever imperialism got drunk and went wild among native peoples, the Pankhurst paper would be on the job.”In a Dreadnought editorial published at the height of that summer’s riots on 7 June 1919, under the title Stabbing Negroes in the London Dock Area, Pankhurst had submitted “a few questions for the consideration of those who have been negro hunting”. These included: “Do you not know that capitalists, and especially British capitalists, have seized by force of arms the countries inhabited by black people and are ruling those countries and the black inhabitants for their own profit … Do you think you would be better employed in getting conditions made right for yourself and your fellow workers than in stabbing a black man?”Her words greatly impressed McKay, and in London he became familiar with Pankhurst’s Workers’ Socialist Federation (WSF) which regularly held meetings and fundraisers. McKay wrote that Pankhurst didn’t just talk about revolutionary Marxism, she lived by it, advocating and living alongside workers in the East End. Pankhurst was a “good agitator and fighter”, he declared, possessing the “magnetism to attract people to [the] organisation”. The pair found that they had much in common. McKay was an outspoken advocate of women’s rights and suffrage, a pacifist and an agnostic. The unlikely partnership of the 29-year-old fresh-faced Jamaican with the battle-hardened suffragette proved to be enduring.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Emmeline, Christabel and Sylvia Pankhurst at Waterloo station in 1911.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesIn April 1920, when Pankhurst offered McKay enough money for room and board in exchange for a full-time position as the paper’s labour correspondent, he jumped at the chance. One of his first tasks was to cover the volatile situation on London’s docks, interviewing sailors of all races to gauge the roots of their discontent. He covered strikes and trade union meetings, and he was assigned the task of aggregating articles from the foreign press, with a particular eye for any pieces that criticised the British imperial project. In his first cover essay for the paper, McKay argued that nationalist movements, particularly among subject peoples in Britain’s colonies, would lead to an embrace of communism, stating that “the British empire is the greatest obstacle to international socialism, and any of its subjugated parts succeeding in breaking away from it would be helping the cause of world communism”.McKay’s output was prolific. He published numerous essays, articles, book reviews and some of his most militant poems, often under pseudonyms. He had written under pen names in the US, concerned that putting his name to his radical verse would affect his employment prospects. Once in Britain, he continued the habit, particularly as the activities of the WSF were being scrutinised by Scotland Yard.Through McKay’s writing, the Dreadnought provided a Black perspective at a time when people of colour were being demonised in the mainstream media. After the first world war, the major London-based newspapers that served communities of colour – such as the African Times and Orient Review – were in rapid decline.On 6 April 1920, French troops retaliating against Germany’s violation of the Versailles Treaty occupied the major cities on the east bank of the Rhine. Approximately 2% of the 250,000 French troops in the Rhineland were from west Africa, but the idea of Black troops occupying part of a white European country was viewed as repugnant by some. During the occupation, French Moroccan soldiers (there was also a large contingent from Senegal) fired on a German crowd protesting against their presence in Frankfurt, killing several civilians. In covering the event, the Daily Herald drew attention to the race of the French troops; it was the only English newspaper to do so. On 9 April, it ran with the front-page headline: “Frankfurt runs with blood: French black troops use machine guns on civilians.”The next day, the Herald ran a series of front-page articles by the journalist ED Morel, reporting the hostilities in racial terms. Under the headline Black Scourge in Europe: Sexual Horror Let Loose by France on the Rhine, Morel alleged that Black troops, “primitive African barbarians”, had “become a terror and a horror unimaginable to the countryside, raping women and girls”. During the tirade, he claimed: “Apart from the barely restrainable bestiality of the black troops, syphilis is making terrible ravages where they are stationed.”The reports sparked global outrage, with protests in London and Sweden demanding that the French withdraw their “savage” soldiers. In the US, there was such fury at the conduct of these troops that, in June 1920, President Woodrow Wilson asked the American ambassador in Paris to investigate these stories. A subsequent report commissioned by the diplomat EL Dresel reported that nearly all the stories about “black horror” on the Rhine were untrue and praised the discipline of the Senegalese soldiers. Morel later admitted he had no evidence or reliable reports for his claims but continued to state that “sexually [the African race] are unrestrained and unrestrainable. That is perfectly well known.”View image in fullscreenClaude McKay and the German avant garde artist and poet Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven in Paris in 1921.Photograph: Everett Collection Historical/AlamyHis words incensed McKay, who dispatched a letter to the Herald. The Herald’s editor, George Lansbury, refused to publish it (he later cited matters of space); but Pankhurst published it in the Dreadnought under the heading A Black Man Replies. “Why all this obscene, maniacal outburst about the sex vitality of black men in a proletarian paper?” asked McKay. He challenged the assertion that Black troops were syphilitic, arguing that the disease was endemic among soldiers of all races. In his conclusion he drew a direct correlation between such articles and the racial violence plaguing British cities:“I feel that the ultimate result of your propaganda will be further strife and blood-spilling between whites and many members of my race, boycotted economically and socially … I have been told in Limehouse by white men, who ought to know, that this summer will be a recrudescence of the outbreaks that occurred last year. The negro-baiting bourbons of the United States will thank you, and the proletarian underworld will certainly gloat over the scoop of the Christian-socialist pacifist Daily Herald.”Like most of his comrades at the newspaper, McKay took an active role in distributing the tuppence-priced news sheet at workers’ rallies. At a Sinn Féin rally in Trafalgar Square in the summer of 1920, McKay donned a green necktie to sell the Dreadnought, along with Pankhurst’s pamphlet Rebel Ireland, and was welcomed with hearty handshakes as Black Murphy or Black Irish by the Sinn Féin members. His activities were watched intently by British intelligence. Articles he had written in the Dreadnought about Ireland had not escaped their radar.Pankhurst entrusted McKay with great responsibility on the paper. He was given considerable autonomy in his reportage, and his radical poetry was not subject to any censorship from Pankhurst. When Pankhurst was away on WSF work, McKay often acted as the managing editor. In the autumn of 1920, McKay wrote to a friend, complaining of overwork: “I have been kept so frightfully busy by Sylvia Pankhurst since she came back [from abroad]. She has been experiencing all sorts of domestic and business difficulties, due to her own erratic nature, and all the routine work of getting out the paper falls to me as consequence.”The two occasionally had disagreements. In the summer of 1920, McKay had published a flowery profile piece on Robert Smillie, charismatic leader of the miners’ federation, which Pankhurst admonished him for, stating the policy of the Dreadnought was not to praise official labour leaders but to criticise them. She also suppressed an article he had written about a strike at a large lumber mill near the Dreadnoughtoffices. McKay had written that William Lansbury, the owner, had employed non-union workers and the article stressed Lansbury’s family connections with the editor of the Daily Herald. Pankhurst had her reasons for killing the piece: years before, as a militant suffragette, she had avoided arrest because William Lansbury had smuggled her out of town hidden beneath wood stacks on the floor of his timber wagon. She also owed several debts to his relative George Lansbury, which included the costs of printing the Dreadnought. McKay ruefully concluded that “after all … there are items which the capitalist press does not consider fit to print for capitalist reasons and items which the radical press does not consider fit to print for radical reasons”.In July 1920, Pankhurst attended the Second World Congress of the Communist International in Russia. The Home Office had confiscated her passport, so inventive methods of travel involved stowing away on a freighter. While Pankhurst was away fraternising with Lenin, McKay did one of his regular stints as managing editor.During this time, he wrotethe narrative essayThe Yellow Peril and the Dockersunder the pseudonym Leon Lopez. At West India Docks in London’s East End, he described “scores of seamen, white, brown and black, waiting wistfully for an undermanned ship”. He outlined the precarious nature of the work and how the dockers’ wives and children were starving and clothed in rags. The article highlighted how capitalism pits those deemed “alien” against their fellows. In his final passage, McKay stated: “The country’s riches are not in the West End, in the palatial homes of the suburbs; they are stored in the East End, and the jobless should lead the attack on the bastilles, the bonded warehouses along the docks, to solve the question of unemployment.”McKay also commissioned the cover story in the 16 October 1920 issue by a Royal Navy sailor, written under a pseudonym. It illustrated the issues facing dock-workers – paltry wages, the rising costs of seamen’s clothing – and called for a formation of “a Red Navy to protect the interests of the working class”, exclaiming: “Are you going to see your class go under in the fight with the capitalist brutes who made millions out of your sacrifices during the war?”View image in fullscreenGrigory Zinoviev, Claude McKay and Nikolai Bukharin in 1923.Photograph: AlamyThe authorities viewed these articles as an incitement to class war. The WSF had long been a thorn in the side of the security services and, with fear of Bolshevism spreading, they seized on this as an excuse to shut down “the organ of the Communist party”. On 18 October 1920, the Dreadnought’s offices were raided. Pankhurst was recently returned from Russia, and her secretary ran up the stairs to warn McKay that the police were downstairs ransacking the main offices and questioning Pankhurst about her informant in the Royal Navy. He returned to his small office upstairs, retrieved the original article by “Hunter”, and, secreting it in his sock, managed to evade the scrutiny of the officers, eventually flushing it down the toilet. Pankhurst was arrested shortly after for inciting treason among the Royal Navy by advocating that its workers should go on strike.A young Finn named Erkki Veltheim, who was on staff at the paper and worked closely with McKay, helping him translate articles in the foreign press, was also arrested. The police discovered in his possession letters from Pankhurst to Lenin and other Bolshevik officials, and Veltheim (whose nickname at the paper was Comrade Vie) was revealed as a Bolshevik courier, who had entered Britain illegally. Veltheim was deported after six months’ imprisonment for alien non-registration. Pankhurst was prosecuted as the paper’s editor for sedition, and imprisoned for six months in Holloway. The Dreadnought folded in 1924 after a decade in print.Fearing that he might be arrested, McKay left England in early 1921, sailing for the US the same day that Pankhurst began serving her sentence. In New York, the Eastmans employed him as associate editor on the Liberator, making him the only Black editor on a white journal. McKay wrote: “I responded with my hand and my head and my heart … My experience with the Dreadnought in London was of great service to me now.”McKay’s most famous collection of poetry, Harlem Shadows,was published in the spring of 1922. Soon after, disappointed that Max Eastman did not take the anti-colonial struggle seriously enough, McKay left the Liberator for Russia. He was determined to see for himself Lenin’s “grand experiment”.In Russia, he addressed the Fourth Congress of the Communist International, alongside the Black Surinamese communist Otto Huiswoud, on the position and potential of Black workers in the international labour movement. The pair were the first Black people to discuss such issues before the Comintern, also speaking about the exploitation of Black troops by both Britain and France in the first world war.From 1919 to 1922, McKay had used his status as a journalist to highlight the issues facing Black workers in the US and Europe. By the end of 1922, he was suffering his own crisis of identity. McKay had borne the burden of speaking for his whole race. His activities were being monitored not only by the British police but also by the FBI, which, unbeknownst to him, had drawn up a document describing him as a “well-known radical” and was scrutinising his relationship with the revolutionary IWW and Pankhurst.Wary of being persecuted as a radical, McKay allowed himself to be gripped by what he called the “vagabond spirit” – to write poetry and see the world. To this end, he travelled to Berlin in May 1923, where he became a familiar figure in his flamboyant, chequered suits in the city’s cabaret bars. As hyperinflation gripped the country, McKay found that moneys his friends had sent him months previously had devalued overnight.Unable to survive in Germany, McKay left for France, where he would write some of his most important and memorable fiction – the bestseller Home to Harlem (1928), in which a former soldier tries to rebuild his fractured life after the first world war, and Banjo(1929),which was based largely on his experiences in Marseille in the summer of 1926. These works and his poetry would establish McKay as a leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance. But McKay lived an itinerant and largely threadbare existence, in exile in Europe and fearful of returning to the US because of his communist past.The secret deportations: how Britain betrayed the Chinese men who served the country in the warRead moreIn 1934, in his mid-40s, he returned to an economically broken US. Most depressingly for a writer of his stature, he was forced to lodge at Harlem’s YMCA and accept work at Greycourt, a camp for the destitute. By the time of his death in May 1948 of heart failure, he said he had grown disillusioned with all the “isms” (whether communism, capitalism, racism, nationalism or imperialism) and had always taken an independent path.It was only decades after McKay’s death that his fiction was recognised as offering unparalleled insights into historic multicultural communities, and the lives blighted by poverty and colonialism. The Black power activist Stokely Carmichael claimed that Winston Churchill used the words of If We Must Die, without attribution, to rally wartime England. McKay’s nomadic lifestyle meant his writing traversed continents, offering a rare Black perspective of the time, but it was in the Dreadnought’s offices in London, where he described the fog’s stifling embrace as a “heavy, suffocating shroud”, that he first reckoned with the revolutionary power of the pen.Adapted from Ink!

KTN News and Citizen TV later said the death toll had increased to four, with scores injured. After security forces fired shots, police used teargas to disperse thousands of mourners, the two broadcasters reported, leaving the stadium deserted.Earlier in the day, thousands of mourners briefly stormed Nairobi’s international airport, interrupting a ceremony for the president, William Ruto, and other officials to receive Odinga’s body with military honours. The incident prompted a two-hour suspension of airport operations.Crowds also flooded nearby roads and tried to breach parliament, where the government had originally scheduled the public viewing.Though mainly known as an opposition figure, Odinga became prime minister in 2008 and also struck a political pact with Ruto last year in a career marked by shifting alliances.View image in fullscreenOfficers inside Kasarani stadium, where security forces used teargas and opened fire to disperse crowds.Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPAHe commanded passionate devotion among supporters, especially in his Luo community based in western Kenya, many of whom believe he was denied the presidency by electoral fraud.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We appreciate that, we don’t take it for granted.”Wanjiru, a 21-year-old hairdresser, disappeared after a night out in Nanyuki, Kenya in 2012. Her body was found several weeks later in the grounds of the hotel where she was last seen.Last month, a Kenyan court issued a warrant for the arrest of a suspect in the case, named as Robert James Purkiss, a former British soldier, who has been charged by a Kenyan court with a single count of murder.In order for the suspect to face charges in Kenya, an extradition request will first have to be received and authorised by the UK courts.“I’m hoping that whatever we discussed, it will be put into consideration, and things will be fast-tracked, because there’s the extradition process that is ahead,” Njoki said.“I believe … his hands are tied. He can’t do much because he might prejudice the criminal matter. But again, if there is political will, things might go faster. So we’re just hoping that things will be taken seriously and they’ll keep us updated as the family, and ensure that justice is served.”Healey, who had urged the previous government to act in Wanjiru’s case while in opposition, also met the family in Kenya in April, becoming the first UK government minister to do so.“We appreciate it, because it’s the second time, he’s a senior official. It’s hard to meet such people, so I appreciate the support that he always gives, and being willing to meet us and to listen to our grievances,” Njoki said.“We don’t take it for granted, and I appreciate him because we are seeing things changing, and then even he’s the first minister to meet us for over 13 years.”During her five-day visit, Njoki, who is studying communications at the University of Nairobi, gave media interviews to raise the profile of the case, and also appeared on a panel at the House of Commons.She sat alongside speakers including Ben Keith, a barrister specialising in international law and extradition, and Tessa Gregory, the UK lawyer acting for Wanjiru’s family.Njoki said she hoped her advocacy work would not only bring justice for her aunt, but improve the lives of women in Kenya. “This is a way of changing things, just small steps,” she said. “It’s a sign of hope that everything is possible. Despite where you come from, your background doesn’t have to define you.”Healey said: “Six months since our first meeting in Kenya, I was pleased to welcome the niece of the late Agnes Wanjiru, Esther Njoki, to London, to reiterate our government’s steadfast support for her family’s long and painful fight for justice.“I want to pay tribute to Esther, who is an extraordinary spokesperson for her family, and for women who have suffered violence.”He added: “We reflected on the significant progress made in recent months, with the case file being handed to the director of public prosecutions in April and a charging decision being made last month“Our government will continue to do everything we can to support the Kenyan investigation, secure a resolution to this case and finally bring peace to Esther and her grieving family.”Explore more on these topicsKenyaMilitaryAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It argues in the document that biofuels – made from a wide variety of organic matter such as sugar cane in the case of ethanol – will displace fossil fuels and that they represent a benefit to the climate and environment.But this is disputed by green experts and campaigners, who point out thatbiofuel productionis resulting inincreased deforestation in many regions, leading to thereplacement of land that is rich in species with monocultures, and reducing the land available for food production. Astudy by the Transport and Environment thinktank, published this month, shows that at present “biofuels are responsible globally for 16% more CO2emissions than the fossil fuels they replace due to the indirect impacts of farming and deforestation”.The report found that:By 2030, biofuel crops would require land the size of France, which would make it equivalent to the sixth-largest country in terms of arable land use globallyA fifth of vegetable oil is used for cars rather than food.That 3,000 litres of water are needed to drive 100km on biofuels.That solar panels could create as much energy as biofuels while using just 3% as much land.The draft pledge stipulates that the increased volume of biofuels should come from environmentally sustainable sources.Andreas Sieber, an associate director of policy and campaigns at350.org, said: “So-called ‘sustainable fuels’ must never deflect from the central task: transitioning away from fossil fuels and scaling up renewables. While Brazil’s interest in biofuels may partly come from good intentions, presenting ‘sustainable fuels’ as an equal pillar to renewables is misguided. These fuels often exaggerate their climate benefits, worsen food insecurity, and drive biodiversity loss through monocultures of corn, soy and sugarcane. The transition away from fossil fuels must remain the overarching goal.“It’s particularly worrying to already see countries like Italy and Japan join this initiative and co-opt this narrative for industrial or political convenience. That’s not climate leadership, it’s a dangerous distraction.”Cian Delaney, a biofuels campaigner at T&E, said: “This pledge involves doubling the world’s supply of biofuels. It’s difficult to imagine a scenario where this doesn’t require more land clearance. Without any commitment from countries to meet the target without clearing more land, this will be devastating for the climate, ecosystems and food security.”The Guardian has also seen a draft of the agenda for the leaders’ summit, which Brazilis hosting in Belémon 6 and 7 November, before the start of the fortnight-longCop30 climate conferencein the same city on 10 November.The plans reflect a divided government, with an uneasy coalition headed by the president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, that includes people ranging from some of the world’s most ambitious environmentalists to diehard supporters of agribusiness.The opening day will focus on forests, including a Brazilian initiative, supported by the UK and other European governments, to establish a “Tropical Forests Forever Facility” that aims to raise $125bn (£93bn) to support standing forests. This will be followed by a forest-themed afternoon of speeches, possibly including a “presentation by a representative of Indigenous peoples”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is a contentious topic. The world agreed at Cop28 in Dubai to“transition away from fossil fuels”, but last year, Saudi Arabia blocked attempts to move forward with this goal. In preliminary discussions for Cop30, Saudi Arabia has again tried to remove this from the agenda. But the Brazilian environment minister, Marina Silva, has pushed for more action and the leak suggests this will be under discussion by leaders.The crucial issue ofhow to meet the Paris agreement goalof limiting global heating to 1.5C will be addressed at the end of the leaders’ summit, in a discussion of countries’plans on greenhouse gas emissions, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs).Lula will also call for stronger action on debt forgiveness for poor countries, in exchange for investments in environmental protection and clean energy.A spokesperson from Brazil’s foreign affairs ministry said: “Brazil is not proposing that countries quadruple biofuels. The proponents of the pledge (which include Japan, Italy, India, among others) are calling upon countries to support quadrupling production and use of sustainable fuels – a group of gaseous and liquid fuels that include e-fuels, biogases, biofuels, hydrogen and its derivatives.“The proposed fourfold increase is a global goal (countries are not expected to individually quadruple production). It is based on an IEA report released this week that said this production increase is both feasible and necessary to reduce emissions, particularly from hard-to-abate sectors. The IEA report is a sound, scientific document underpinning the proposed Belém 4x pledge. The word ‘sustainable’ is not used lightly, neither in the report nor in the pledge.“For a fuel to be sustainable, it must have low-GHG intensity over its lifecycle, measured in grams of CO2equivalent by megajoule of fuel (gCO2;MJ). It also needs to comply with a set of non-GHG criteria, such as biodiversity conservation, sustainable water management and compliance with social safeguards. These concerns are taken seriously and have been integrated into the design of the declaration itself.”Explore more on these topicsBiofuelsBrazilCop30Luiz Inácio Lula da SilvaGreenhouse gas emissionsTrees and forestsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s our Trinidadian maritime law and I think every fisherman and every human knows that,” she said.Burnley said her son was planning to return toTrinidad and Tobagoafter spending three months with family in Venezuela, just 6.8 miles (11km) away.Joseph’s grandmother Christine Clement also rejected claims of trafficking, calling the attack “wickedness”.At least 27 people have been killed so far in such attacks off the coast of Venezuela, which theTrump administrationsays are necessary to protect the United States from narcotics smuggled from Venezuela.Last month, fishers in Las Cuevastold the Guardianthat they were afraid of being caught in the crossfire amid Trump’s “war on drugs” in the region. Instead of their usual route, heading west toward Venezuela, fishers said they now head east, staying close to the coast of Trinidad.The Washington Post reported on Thursday that the US had since expanded its mission with elite special operations aviation unit helicopters conducting training exercises in the region.Trinidadian fishers fear getting caught in the crossfire amid Trump’s Caribbean ‘war on drugs’Read moreTrinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, had previously expressed strong support for a US strike on a Venezuela-based drug vessel,telling local journalistsshe had “no sympathy for traffickers” and that the US military should “kill them all violently”. She added that the military mission would reduce violence in the region and asked for divine protection for US personnel involved in the mission.But other Caribbean leaders have described theUS militaryactivity as a threat to the peace and security in the region.Antigua and Barbuda’s prime minister, Gaston Browne,made it clearthat his country had no interest in hosting foreign military installations, after Grenada’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed it was carefully reviewing a request from the US for the “temporary installation of radar equipment and associated technical personnel”.In response to US military buildup in the region,Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s president, ordered large-scale military exercises on Wednesday and said he wasmobilizing the military, police and a civilian militiato defend his country.Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoUS militaryTrump administrationDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroVenezuelaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It will also address several other far-reaching changes proposed by Noboa, including a reduction of seats in the legislative assembly, party funding and foreign military bases.View image in fullscreenA volcanic crater lake in San Cristóbal, Galápagos Islands.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe referendum will be the most controversial move yet by the president, who has already prompted alarm with several pieces of legislation that critics say undermine environmental safeguards and democratic checks and balances.A protected areas law, for example, purportedly enhances environmental sustainability and the management of conservation areas, but Indigenous groups say it is a ruse to bypass their right to free, prior and informed consent, while potentially opening up protected land to privatisation and extractive industries.A national solidarity law was ostensibly passed to strengthen the government’s authority and resources to tackle organised crime, but it has been used, say observers, to militarise public security and provide impunity for police and military killings carried out in the name of a war against gangs. A new intelligence law has given unprecedented surveillance powers to the administration, which can intercept communications without a court order. Meanwhile, a public integrity law, which claims to tame corruption, has become a tool to crack down on civil society.Social unrest has mounted steadily in Ecuador. The country has one of thehighest homicide ratesin the world. Rising prices of food and diesel have added to the tensions, prompting an ongoing national strike. Last month, an Indigenous land defender, Efraín Fueres, wasshot and killedby the army during a protest against the high cost of living, a lack of medicine in hospitals, the deterioration of schools and growing social insecurity.Demonstrators are also angry that at least 61 civil society leaders and organisations have had their bank accounts frozen, pending an “unjustified private enrichment” investigation by the public prosecutors office.The Guardian has seen a list of those facing persecution. More than half were Indigenous activists, several of them campaigning against mines. Another quarter were environmental defenders. The rest were academics, journalists, women’s rights activists and local politicians.Among those under scrutiny was the Pachamama Foundation, which released astatement sayingit would resist this attempted intimidation. “We categorically reject the criminalisation process that has been initiated,” thefoundation said.The accusations come at a time when Noboa’s administration has been criticised for pushing ahead with mining projects that had been blocked by public consultations, and accused of doing nothing to implement the 2023referendum decisionto halt oil production in block 43 of the Yasuni national park, an area of the Amazon rainforest famed for its ecological diversity. Instead, the president has subsumed the environment ministry inside the mining ministry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

All of this is being systematically trampled on by the government of President Daniel Noboa. The president does not want to respect the constitution or public consultation.”Acosta sees this as part of a global trend, led by the US president, Donald Trump: “What is happening in the United States is encouraging many governments in Latin America, and in Ecuador in particular, to mobilise extractivist forces that are destroying the ecological balance and affecting Indigenous communities.”Justices fear the rule of law is under threat; in recent months, the constitutional court has been the only brake on presidential power, successfully delaying several of Noboa’s moves to remove civil liberties or environmental protections. When the justicessuspendedsecurity legislation in August, Noboa denounced them as “enemies of the people” and organised protests outside the court.In the past decade, Ecuador’s highest court has also set a global example in its rulings in favour of the rights of nature,most famously in 2021when it declared mining permits in the Los Cedros cloud forest were unconstitutional because they threatened the biodiversity of a protected forest.The retired constitutional court judge Agustín Grijalva, who played a key role in the Los Cedros ruling, said his former colleagues were under intense pressure, which could get worse depending on the referendum outcome. “They want to reform or replace the constitution so they can impeach constitutional judges,” he said. “They will have their own court. And that is very dangerous for democracy and also for nature. It would put at risk all of the rulings of the past.”Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

The bill would also restore or grant citizenship descendants who were excluded under older citizenship laws.But Kat Lanteigne, whose adopted son was born in Zambia, said a new requirement that a Canadian child born abroad demonstrate a “substantial connection” toCanadatreats adopted children like immigrants. “It doesn’t treat our son like the Canadian citizen that he is,” she said.In 2009, changes were made to Canada’s citizenship laws that stopped the automatic transmission of citizenship by descent to foreign-born children if both of their Canadian parents were also born in a foreign country.The rule was struck down by an Ontario court in 2023 and Mark Carney’s Liberal government have proposed legislation that purports to fix elements of the law that were deemed to be unconstitutional.But Lanteigne said the proposed fix imposes a “connection test” that conflates children born outside Canada with children born outside Canada but adopted by Canadians within Canada.Government officials say as many as 2,000 children could be affected by the wording of the legislation.“We adopted our child from another country, but we actually adopted our child in the province of Ontario and in the country of Canada,” she said. “He doesn’t know any other nation except for his life in Canada.”Although elements of the bill have not yet been passed into law, Lanteigne says if her son were to move abroad and have children, he would, in theory, have to prove his “substantial connection” to Canada in order to pass citizenship on to any children. The connection test would not apply in similar circumstances to someone born in Canada.“Demanding an international adoptee, who has been adopted by Canadian families who live in Canada and granted citizenship by the Canadian government, go through a test that they really are Canadian is like asking them who their ‘real’ parents are. Not only is it deleterious and harmful to the international adoptee, it violates the international law that our country is signatory to,” she said. “It’s wholly unnecessary and inherently cruel.”The 1993 Hague convention on inter-country adoption says: “The [adopted] child shall enjoy in the receiving state, and in any other contracting state where the adoption is recognized, rights equivalent to those resulting from adoptions having this effect in each such state.”While all Canadian provinces and territories are in line with the convention, Lanteigne said Bill C-3 puts the federal government in breach.In early October, parliament’s standing committee on citizenship and immigration voted down an amendment from Liberal member Nathaniel Erskine-Smith that sought to fix the issue.Erskine-Smith told lawmakers “any inequality” between a child born in Canada and born abroad is “unconscionable”.The mood was at times tense at the committee after -Smith told experts he felt “absolutely misled” by their assessments of his amendments, neither of which passed. The first was withdrawn after Erskine-Smith was told the amendment logically “applied to no one” based on its wording and the second voted down by the committee despite the Liberals, which hold a minority of seats on the committee, all voting to support the amendment.Two conservative members on the committee raised concerns over the possibility that children adopted from abroad could be the victims of human trafficking.“Conflating child trafficking with the quality of our son’s citizenship status is dog-whistle politics which has no place in this discussion,” Lanteigne said in a letter addressed to the Tory lawmakers. “My Canadian son’s citizenship rights are not fodder for partisanship or xenophobic rhetoric.”In Canada, citizenship is granted to children from abroad atthe end of the adoption process – a protracted bureaucratic process that takes years.Erskine-Smith and Lanteigne pointed to laws in the UK which treat children adopted internationally as if they had been born in the UK to a British citizen parent, meaning they can pass on British citizenship to any children they have.“Our child is a 16th-generation Acadian whose ancestors built Acadia, served atVimy RidgeandDieppe, and his charter rights must be protected by our legislators,” said Lanteigne. “The fact that he was born in another nation should have no bearing on the quality and consideration of his citizenship status.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaChildrenAdoptionAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

That includes constructive and robust engagement at a variety of levels.”The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly pulled the charges against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, a teacher, last month. The CPS argued that the government had not provided sufficient evidence that China represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”.Starmerpublished the three witness statementssubmitted by a deputy national security adviser, Matthew Collins, to prosecutors on Wednesday after accusations he had interfered with the trial to protect the UK’s trading relationship with China.No 10 moves to end China spy row – but threat of further fallout lingersRead moreIn a letter to the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, on Thursday, the prime minister rejected Tory claims that Powell had a role in shaping the evidence that ultimately led the case to collapse.He wrote that while Powell attended a meeting about the case with senior Whitehall officials in September, “these discussions were based on the working assumption that the case would proceed – which was the desired outcome of the government – and focused on how to handle the implications”. The meeting, on 1 September, took place nearly a month after Collins submitted his final witness statement to the CPS on 4 August.View image in fullscreenJonathan Powell, the national security adviser.Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/APPowell last travelled to Beijing in mid-July where he met China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi. TheChinese government saidthey had discussed the UK government’s desire for “a consistent, lasting and mutually respectful relationship”.Phillipson is planning to travel to China later this year for talks on education, according to two people briefed on the discussions. Vallance’s trip next month, which wasfirst reported by PoliticsHome, is to hold a formal, in-person forum on science, innovation and technology for the first time since 2018. Virtual talks were held in 2021.The visits are the latest examples of high-level engagement between the UK and China which has stepped up since Labour entered power. Rishi Sunak’s administrationsought to pursue a similar approachbut was hamstrung by political instability and opposition from hawkish Tory backbenchers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bolger suffered kidney failure last year and had been undergoing dialysis.A former National party leader, he served as prime minister from 1990 until 1997.Politicians from across the political spectrum paid tribute to Bolger after the news of his death, describing him as a man with high ideals, dogged determination and a great warmth for people.Guaranteed Māori seats on New Zealand councils to be slashed by more than halfRead more“To those who worked alongside him, he was a principled and formidable colleague,” said the prime minister, Christopher Luxon. “To his political opponents, he was a worthy adversary who never allowed disagreement to become personal.”Labour’s leader,Chris Hipkins, said Bolger was “humble, dedicated [and] passionate”, and pointed to his ability later in life to acknowledge growing inequality.“He could see that the concentration of wealth around the world was unsustainable, that the growing marginalisation of large segments of our society was leading to us becoming more divided and that we could not continue to stand for that.”Bolger entered parliament in 1972 and became leader of the National party in 1986 before becoming prime minister in 1990 when the party took power. He retired from politics in 1998 and served as New Zealand’s ambassador to the United States from 1998 to 2002.During his premiership, he oversaw the infamous 1991 “mother of all budgets”, delivered by his finance minister, Ruth Richardson, which severely cut spending on welfare and health. The budget was so unpopular it nearly cost his government the next election.Bolger pursued privatisation and oversaw the deregulation of the labour market that resulted in major declines in union membership.Bolger later disavowed neoliberalism, tellingRNZ in 2017it had failed to produce economic growth and “what growth there has been has gone to the few at the top”.During his time in government, Bolger ushered in the “mixed member proportional” electoral system that New Zealand still uses today.His legacy on treaty settlements – a system set up in 1975 to remedy the Crown’s breaches of the country’s founding document, theTreaty of Waitangi– will be long lasting.Bolger’s government concluded the first settlements betweenMāoritribes and the government – for the impact of colonisation.In his book A View From the Top, Bolger reflected on the settlement process.“Something within me – perhaps it is my Irish heritage, which is that of a nation oppressed for centuries – demanded that I listen to the Māori story, speak with those who wanted to talk about the grievances and determine in due course what could be done.”Tukoroirangi Morgan, chair of the Waikato Tainui iwi or tribe, said Bolger left a legacy in the settlement space that would remain unsurpassed.“Jim modernised the whole process of reconciliation in an effort to bring Aotearoa-New Zealand closer together to reflect a more contemporary reality of our nation,” he said.Green MP Teanu Tuiono said Bolger believed in the treaty, historical justice and the collective responsibility to honour the treaty.“When people questioned him on why treaty settlements, he said: ‘Because it is the right thing to do.’”Bolger was a committed republican and did not take a knighthood after he left politics. Instead he was made a member of New Zealand’s highest order, the Order of New Zealand.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsNew ZealandMāoriNew Zealand politicsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

In rare earths, the administration would also set price floors and strategic stockpiles.Under Donald Trump, the US has shifted from subsidies to direct stakes in companies including Intel Corp, minerals miner Trilogy Metals and rare earths miner MP Materials.“We’re not going to come in and take stakes in non-strategic industries, but we’ve identified seven industries” to develop domestically, Bessent said. The government had to be “very careful not to overreach” and to ensure that investments were meeting its strategic goals, he added.Bessent spoke days after Beijing announced fresh controls on the export of rare earth technologies and items, leading Trump to threaten 100% tariff on goods from China starting on 1 November. China is the world’s leading producer of the minerals used to make magnets crucial to the auto, electronic and defence industries.US trade representative Jamieson Greer warned at a Wednesday press briefing that US plans for a tariff hike or other export controls were in the works.“China’s announcement [on export controls] is nothing more than a global supply chain power grab,” he said. “This move is not proportional retaliation. It is an exercise in economic coercion on every country in the world.”Bessent said US and Chinese officials were in touch to set up a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping, adding that it was the level of trust between the two leaders that had prevented a further escalation of the trade conflict.The US does not want to decouple from China, but would have to take action if Beijing proved to be an unreliable supplier, Bessent said, noting that Chinese officials recently told US auto companies that a slowdown in shipments of rare earth magnets was “probably something” to do with a holiday.“Not only is China fuelling Russia’s war [in Ukraine], but China’s actions have once again demonstrated the risk of being dependent on them, on rare earths and for that matter, anything,” Bessent said, adding, “If China wants to be an unreliable partner to the world, then the world will have to decouple.”With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificMiningInternational tradeGlobal economyTrump administrationUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Pick a spot.Choose any location, your back yard, balcony, local park or work window.3. Take 20 minutes.Quietly observe and record the birds you see and hear in that location.4. Submit your sightings.Log the species and numbers via the free Aussie bird count app or the BirdLife Australia website.The app offers an identification tool, allowing users to enter a bird’s size, colour and shape to get a list of possible candidates.Participants can count as many times as they would like during the week, as long as each count lasts 20 minutes and is submitted separately.Why take part in the Aussie Bird Count?Last year, more than 57,000 participants collectively tallied 4.1 million birds.The aggregated data is a powerful tool, especially sinceone in six Australian bird species is now under threat.After more than a decade of reports, the annual count enables BirdLife Australia to track long-term population shifts, identify which species are thriving and understand the impact of urban development on our diverse bird communities.It is a simple, meditative act that contributes to a collective goal.“It really is a grounding experience, I find it incredibly relaxing and the feedback we get from people is just that,” Dooley says.What is the power of a single survey?Every survey acts as a “pixel in a national snapshot”, Dooley says. “So the more pixels we have, the clearer the images.”The results of the count indicate some species thrive more than others.Last year therainbow lorikeet topped the eventas the most numerous bird recorded across the country – a position it’s held since the count began in 2014. It was followed by the noisy miner and the Australian magpie.Dooley says common, bold species continue to thrive, often to the detriment of smaller, more vulnerable birds. Aggressive species, such as noisy miners, crows, ravens and butcherbirds, are increasingly competing for urban real estate, pushing smaller birds out.“After 11 years of the bird count, we’re seeing that the common birds continue to do well: the rainbow lorikeet, noisy miner, magpie, red wattlebird, the little corella,” Dooley says.Despite coming in third, the magpie was recorded by more individual people than any other species, spotted by one in two participants who completed the count.However, the data also highlights worrying trends. “Bird count trends show a decline in the reporting rates of small garden birds – including silvereyes and willy wagtails in almost every city,” Dooley says.Explore more on these topicsBirdsAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Even the select group of environment and industry lobby groups who meet weekly with Watt to discuss EPBC reform are yet to see draft legislation.The Woodside case proves what we’ve long suspected: Australia’s ‘environment protection’ law does no such thingRead moreWatt has made two announcements: the introduction of “no-go” and “go” zones that either ban or accelerate development approvals; and this week he announced plans for a bilateral agreement with Western Australia to allow the mining state – which opposed Labor’s original “nature positive” agenda – to assess projects under federal laws. He is open to similar agreements with other states.But other contentious elements, such as the power of the proposed federal environment protection agency and design of national environmental standards, are either yet to be finalised or remain under wraps.Labor does not have a majority in the Senate, meaning it must strike a quick deal with either the Coalition or the Greens if it wants the laws passed this year.While Watt remains open to either option, senior figures in the Albanese government are understood to favour a deal with the opposition, whose leader, Sussan Ley, commissioned the Samuel review as environment minister in the Morrison government.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWatt has been privately encouraging business groups to lobby the Coalition to support the legislation, which would achieve industry’s desired outcome of sidelining the Greens and their push for a“climate trigger”to force decision-makers to factor in a project’s emissions during the assessment process.The shadow environment minister, Angie Bell, said she has had three “positive” meetings with Watt on the changes, with a fourth imminent, indicating the Ley-led Coalition is far more open to working with Labor than it was under Peter Dutton.The Coalition will wait to see the legislation before deciding a position but the prospect of a deal has increased after Watt this month ruled out a “climate trigger”, even after environmentalists warned the reform would not be credible without it.The major sticking point for the Coalition is likely to be the powers of the environment protection agency, which Bell said must be limited to compliance and enforcement of nature laws – not decision-making on projects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a deal for corporate profits, not a deal for nature or our climate,” she said.“No wonder the minister wants the legislation rammed through the Senate without proper scrutiny.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsMiningLabor partyanalysisShareReuse this content"

And unless governments begin to take reading and literary contribution seriously, that flourishing intellectual life is doomed to evaporate.”The novelist and critic James Bradley, whose work Deep Water was shortlisted for the 2025 Prime Minister’s Literary award for nonfiction, was on the advisory panel.“The NSW government’s new literature strategy will make a material difference to the lives of the state’s writers by investing in creators, strengthening the literary ecosystem and fostering a range of new partnerships with universities, cultural institutions and other organisations,” he said.“But it also helps ensure the benefits of reading and writing are available to everybody by investing in programs to improve literacy and promote reading in schools, supporting First Nations writers and publishing professionals and allowing readers of all ages to connect with writers through events in libraries and elsewhere.”The initiative comes after the Australian Society of Authors launched its latest defence against the onslaught of AI, confirming that Australian writers and illustrators could be eligible for compensation under a landmark US$1.5bn class action settlement against AI company Anthropic in the US.The lawsuit wasbrought by American writerswho allege the company downloaded copyrighted books from theshadow libraryLibGen to train its chatbot.The ASA chief executive, Lucy Hayward, said the association’s searchable list of works would enable Australian writers and illustrators to check whether their creations are among the 500,000 included in the class action. But Hayward said she feared some Australian authors could miss out, even though their books were included in the pirated books dataset, because of the narrow definition of the case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks that he may deliver Tomahawks, which would give Kyiv its longest-range weapon yet that would be capable of striking Moscow with accurate, destructive munitions.However, Trump’s conciliatory tone after the call with Putin left in question the likelihood of immediate assistance to Ukraine and reignited European fears of US capitulation to Moscow.Trump said Putin “didn’t like it” when he raised the possibility during their call of giving Ukraine Tomahawks – which have a range of up to 1,500 miles (2,415km) – but then appeared to cast doubt on whether Zelenskyy would actually get the American-made arm, saying the US could not “deplete” its own supply.“We need them too, so I don’t know what we can do about that,” Trump said.View image in fullscreenTwice over the weekend, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke by phone in what the Ukrainian president described as ‘productive’ talks.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APThe US president, fresh from brokering a peace deal in Gaza, has signalled he is eager to build on the momentum of that diplomatic victory by increasing pressure on Moscow to end Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its fourth year.On the eve of Zelenskyy’s visit, Trump said he was planning to meet Putin in the Hungarian capital on a date still to be determined in an effort to end the war. They previously met in Alaska in August, which did not produce a diplomatic breakthrough.In the past, Trump has set deadlines for Moscow and vowed to impose crippling sanctions on Russia’s economy, only to back down. He has frequently softened his stance after speaking to or meeting Putin.While supplying Tomahawks, the idea of which has already annoyed the Kremlin, would be symbolically significant, they are only available in relatively small numbers, estimated by some experts at 20 to 50 missiles.View image in fullscreenTomahawk cruise missiles are usually launched from ships or submarines, which Ukraine does not have.Photograph: US Navy/Getty ImagesTwice over the weekend, Trump and Zelenskyy spoke by phone in what the Ukrainian president described as “productive” talks – a stunning reversal from February’s White House dressing-down that had laid bare the rift between the two leaders.Tomahawks were first used in combat in 1991 and are normally launched from ships and submarines, which Ukraine does not have. They cost an estimated $1.3m (£1m) each and have a range that puts Moscow well within reach, as well as offering far greater destructive power than long-range drones.There is also a relatively new land-launched variant, the Typhon, more obviously suitable for Ukraine, but the launchers are in short supply. The US army is known only to have two, although another launcher, the X-Mav, which is considered more mobile than the Typhon, was demonstrated this week.Tomahawks graphicRob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute,said: “My understanding is that US doesn’t have a lot of Tomahawks. There are launchers that can launch them from the ground, but the military doesn’t have many of them.”Pavel Luzin, an independent Russian military analyst, said: “The Typhon system itself is new, still being produced for the US military. And it’s not just a launcher – it includes transport and reloading vehicles as well as a dedicated command post.”In recent weeks, theTrump administrationalso authorised the sharing of US intelligence to help Ukraine carry out precision strikes on Russia’s oil refineries using domestically produced drones and US-supplied Atacms missiles. These attacks have led to fuel shortages and a sharp rise in gasoline prices across Russia.Politicians and experts believe the cruise missiles could reinforce that strategy, though the missiles are generally considered most effective if launched in salvoes, which would be difficult with limited numbers.On Tuesday, Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, argued they could be particularly effective becauseRussia’s size makes air defence coverage difficult. The Institute for the Study of War estimates that there are 1,900 Russian military targets within range of the longer 1,500-mile plus Tomahawk variant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Russia will shrug it off,” said Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat.Still, the Kremlin has in recent days issued its strongest warnings to Trump since he assumed office – a striking shift in tone for Moscow, where many had expected Washington to help secure a Ukraine settlement favourable towards Russia.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Vladimir Putin met in Alaska in August, but the summit did not produce a diplomatic breakthrough.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersPutin last week warned the US against supplying Tomahawks, saying their transfer would mark a “qualitatively new stage of escalation”.On Thursday, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov struck a similar note, telling the state-run Radio Mayak that the delivery of the cruise missiles to Ukraine “could lead to a qualitatively new level of escalation in the conflict”, adding: “It would be a very serious new step in that direction.”A former senior Russian defence official said Moscow was less worried about the impact of Tomahawks on the battlefield than about what delivery of the weapons would symbolise.“Moscow doesn’t believe Tomahawks will dramatically change the situation on the ground,” they said, speaking on condition of anonymity.“But it would be the clearest sign yet that Putin is losing Trump – and that is deeply concerning for them. Their delivery would cross a red line, after which Trump could feel emboldened to expand US arms supplies to Ukraine.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyRussiaVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She has been held in Fresnes prison, south of Paris, for the last three years.Shortly after the killing, Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National attempted to make political capital out of the alleged murderer’s irregular migration status.

A church service at Oslo Cathedral was scheduled to follow his apology.The apology took place at the London Pub, one of two bars targeted in the2022 shootingthat killed two people and left nine seriously injured during Oslo’s Pride celebrations. A Norwegian of Iranian origin, who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for the killings.Like many religions around the world, the Church of Norway – an evangelical Lutheran church that is Norway’s largest faith community – had long marginalised LGBTQ+ people, refusing to allow them to become pastors or to marry in church. In the 1950s, the church’s bishopsdescribed gay peopleas a “social danger of global proportions”.View image in fullscreenOlav Fykse Tveit in the London Pub, Oslo, where he gave his speech of apology.Photograph: Javad Parsa/ReutersBut as Norwegian society became increasingly liberal, becoming the second in the world to allow same-sex registered partnerships in 1993 and in 2009 the first Scandinavian country to allow same-sex marriage, the church slowly followed.In 2007, the Church of Norway began ordaining gay pastors, and same-sex couples have been able tomarry in churchsince 2017. In 2023, Tveit participated in Oslo’s Pride parade in what was described as a first for the church.Thursday’s apology was met with a mixed reaction. The head of a network of Christian lesbians in Norway, Hanne Marie Pedersen-Eriksen, herself a gay pastor, described it as “an important reparation” and a moment that “finally marked the end of a dark chapter in the church’s history”.For Stephen Adom, the head of Norway’s Association for Gender and Sexual Diversity, the apology was “strong and important” but had come “too late for those among us who died of Aids … with hearts filled with anguish because the church considered the epidemic to be God’s punishment”.Globally, a handful of religious institutions have sought to make amends for their actions towards LGBTQ+ people. In 2023, the Church of England apologisedfor what it describedas its “shameful” treatment, though itcontinues to refuseto allow same-sex marriages in church.Similarly, the Methodist Church in Ireland last yearapologisedfor its “failures in pastoral support and care” to LGBTQ+ people and their families, but remained staunch in its belief that marriage could only be a union between a man and a woman.Earlier this year, the United Church of Canada offered an apology to two spirit and LGBTQIA+ communities, describing it as a reaffirmation of the church’s “commitment to radical hospitality and full inclusion” in all aspects of church life.“We have failed to celebrate and delight in all of your beautiful creation,” Rev Michael Blair, thegeneral secretary of the church, said. “We have wounded people instead of seeking wholeness.

They want wealth shared. People will not understand if that prosperity is reserved to an elite, or to the big cities.”View image in fullscreenPedro Sanchéz (R) with Salvador Illa at a Unesco conference in Barcelona in SeptemberPhotograph: Toni Albir/EPAAlongside Illa’s economic agenda is a policy of assuaging Junts and Puigdemont, who remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels after the unilateral independence referendum that was declared illegal by Spain’s constitutional court.Puigdemont is negotiating a return, using his ability to bring down Sánchez’s minority government in Madrid as leverage to seek political amnesties, the transfer of migration policy to Catalonia and commitments to pursue Catalan as an official European language.Although Sánchez and Illa said before the 2023 national election that they would oppose amnesties, the Spanish parliamentpassed just such a law in May last year, pardoning those involved in the referendum. Outstanding charges of misuse of public funds against Puigdemont and two others – and not covered by the amnesty law – are also being examined by the constitutional court.Illa was frank about the switch over amnesty, saying: “The circumstances changed after the election and we have to take account of that.“It is about trying to find a way out. This is politics, a pragmatic approach to reality. What we are trying to do is produce an atmosphere of calm and coexistence.”View image in fullscreenSupporters of the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont listen to a public address in Barcelona in August last year.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyThose who said the Socialists would only empower separatist politicians by making concessions to them had been proven wrong, Illa continued. “It has weakened the independence parties,” he said. “The problem was not that there are people that favour an independent Catalonia, the problem is about respecting the rule of law.”He said he would like to see Puigdemont back in Catalonia and active again in politics, and urged the constitutional court to try to settle the remaining issues as quickly as justice allowed. He had even travelled to Brussels to meet Puigdemont to prove – in his words – that dialogue was “the driving force in a democracy”.Illa ascribedthe nationalist surge in Cataloniathat fuelled support for the 2017 referendum –and Brexit in the UK – as populist responses to the financial crisis of 2008. “It was a period when people were offered by quick easy magical solutions to complex problems,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the meantime, the nationalgovernment has introduceda law allowing authorities to cap “disproportionate” rent prices in some areas, and from 2028 bans on AirBnB will be imposed in some cities.The best response, Illa added, was for “social democratic parties to stick to their policies, be bold and not to change our agenda or priorities [to those] of the far right”.Explore more on these topicsCataloniaSpainThe far rightPedro SánchezCarles PuigdemontEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The operation of a number of critically important facilities has been halted.”Ukraine’s state grid operator, Ukrenergo, introduced emergency power cuts in every region of the country after the attacks, it said in a statement on Thursday.Ukraine’s air force said the Russian barrage comprised 320 drones and 37 missiles, adding that 283 drones and five missiles were downed.Map showing range of Tomahawk missiles from Ukraine to RussiaIt said the attacks mainly targeted the Kharkiv region in the north, and the eastern Poltava region, where the country’s largest private energy provider DTEK said a gas production facility was shut down.Media reports earlier suggested about 60% of Ukrainian gas production had been halted in recent Russian strikes, and attacks on power stations had cut electricity supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in Ukraine.The latest strikes came as the Ukrainian military said North Korean troops based in Russia were operating drones across the border on reconnaissance missions – the first time Kyiv has reported a battlefield role for North Koreans in months.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aid agencies sayopening Rafah, which has been controlled by Israel since May last year, is critical for bringing sufficient humanitarian assistance into the territory.“We need more fuel to go intoGaza, we need more food, more medical equipment, medications, medics, doctors,” said Hanan Balkhy, the regional director for the WHO, echoing demands by international leaders for Israel to allow in a massive increase of aid.View image in fullscreenA ‘welcome back home’ sign is illuminated in Habima Square, Tel Aviv.Photograph: Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesIsrael accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement by failing to return the remains of deceased hostages. On Monday, Hamas returned the last 20 surviving hostages but handed back only nine of 28 deceased captives, saying it would need specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the rest from the ruins ofGaza.US advisers working on the implementation of Donald Trump’s ceasefire deal, and the Red Cross, have said there are significant practical difficulties in recovering remains of hostages amid the devastation caused by Israel’s offensive during the past 24 months.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said on Thursday he was determined to ensure Hamas handed back the remains of hostages still in Gaza, adding that the fight “is not over yet”. Speaking at a state ceremony for soldiers killed in the two-year conflict, Netanyahu said Israel would achieve all its war aims and that its enemies had “learned that anyone who lifts a hand against it will pay a heavy price”.A senior Hamas official accused Israel of breaking the ceasefire by killing at least 24 people in shootings since Friday, and said a list of such incidents had been handed over to mediators. “The occupying state is working day and night to undermine the agreement through its violations on the ground,” he said.1:17Gaza humanitarian aid trucks wait to cross intro strip – videoThe Israeli military did not immediately respond but has previously said some Palestinians have ignored warnings not to approach Israeli ceasefire positions and that troops “opened fire to remove the threat”.Regional diplomats and US officials have sought to minimise the significance of the accusations, emphasising thatHamasand Israel still appear committed to the ceasefire. Trump’s 20-point plan includes “full aid” reaching Gaza, wherea famine was declared in some areas in August, as well as the return of all the Israeli hostages, dead and alive.Pope Leo XIV denounced the use of hunger as a weapon of war during an address to a UN agency on Thursday, but did not name any specific conflict or region. Aid workers in Gaza described Israel’s continuing restrictions on aid entering Gaza as “collective punishment”.Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti assaulted by Israeli prison guards, son saysRead moreBalkhy warned that infectious diseases were “spiralling out of control” in Gaza, with only 13 of the Palestinian territory’s 36 hospitals even partially functioning. “Whether meningitis … diarrhoea, respiratory illnesses, we’re talking about a mammoth amount of work,” she said.A spokesperson for Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, suggested that Rafah would remain closed to aid in the future, although individual passage would be allowed. “It should be emphasised that humanitarian aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing. This was never agreed upon at any stage,” it said, adding that aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip through other crossingsUN officials said on Thursday that the ongoing delays had allowed them to clear more aid with Israeli officials in preparation for when crossings reopen.Stéphane Dujarric, a UN spokesperson, said a total of 200,000 metric tons of aid had been approved for entry into Gaza for when officials receive the green light to continue their work, and that the aid that was able to make it into the territory on Sunday, including more than a million nappies, was being quickly distributed to Palestinians by various UN agencies.View image in fullscreenTrucks carrying food aid and fuel, accompanied by a UN team, pass through the Kerem Shalom border crossing on Wednesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesRegional officials told the Guardian they expected the first days and weeks of the ceasefire to be “tense” and “scratchy”, with aid and the return of the remains of hostages among the key issues. Much of Trump’s plan, including many of the most difficult issues, has yet to be fully discussed by negotiating teams.On Monday, Israel freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israeli jails. This figure includes 1,700 Palestinians who were seized from Gaza during the war and held without charge.The ceasefire deal also requires Israel to return the bodies of 360 Palestinians. The Gaza health ministry said it had received 30 more bodies of Palestinians on Thursday, bringing the total to 120 since last Friday. Doctors at Nasser hospital said the bodiesshowed signs of torture and execution, including blindfolds, cuffed hands and bullet wounds in the head, according to doctors’ accounts.“Almost all of them had been blindfolded, and had been bound up, and they had gunshots between the eyes. Almost all of them had been executed,” said Dr Ahmed al-Farra, the head of Nasser hospital’s paediatric department in Khan Younis.Trump has said he would consider allowing Israeli forces to resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas failed to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal. “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word. If Israel could go in and knock the crap of them, they’d do that,” the US president was quoted on Wednesday as saying to CNN in a brief telephone call when asked what would happen if Hamas refused to disarm.In Israel, there have been fierce debates over the fate of the hostages. Arbel Yehud, who was held in captivity for nearly 500 days before being freed under a previous deal in January, said on Wednesday that all the hostages could have returned home “a long time ago”.Speaking at a press conference alongside families of newly freed hostages, including her partner, Ariel Cunio, who was released this week, Yehud said the deal brokered by Trump could have been struck earlier, in turn saving the lives of more hostages. “While we are here, fortunate to embrace our loved ones, there are dozens of families that never will,” said Yehud.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warHamasPalestineIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

You know, you can’t do it immediately. It’s a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,” Trump told reporters, before claiming he would soon convince China of the same thing.However, in a press briefing on Thursday Indian officials appeared to undermine the US president’s account, stating that there was “no telephonic conversation between PM Modi and US President Trump yesterday”.Trump’s demand that India stop buying Russian oil puts Modi in tight spotRead moreIndia, which maintains a strong relationship with the Kremlin, has become one of the biggest purchasers of Russian oil since the invasion ofUkraine.It has beena significant source of contention with Washington in recent monthssince Trump failed to secure a peace deal with Russia. In August, the US president imposed some of his highest tariffs on India to penalise its purchase of Russian oil as he accused Delhi of helping to finance Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. India is subject to additional 25% import tariffs, on top of a base of 25%.India has publicly stood firm, claiming it would not let the US dictate its energy needs or interfere in its relationship with Russia, which dates back to the cold war. Russia remains the largest supplier of arms to India.Earlier on Wednesday, the Indian government said discussions with the US over trade and tariffs were ongoing. A statement by the Indian ministry of external affairs said the priority was to “safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario” and that all policies were dictated by the imperative to diversify and secure India’s energy sources.India has reaped significant benefit from its purchase of cut-price Russian oil since the Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, becoming one of its top purchasers globally, second only to China.However, it has led to a severe deterioration in US-India relations. The White House has increasingly sought to accuse Delhi of bankrolling the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s actions against Ukraine, describing the conflict as “Modi’s war”.However, on Wednesday the US president spoke glowingly of Modi. “Modi is a great man.

He was one of three Sherpas to reach the final camp before the summit with Hillary and Tenzing.Kanchha never climbed to the summit of Everest himself as his wife considered it too risky, he said in an interview in March 2024. He also forbade his children from becoming mountaineers.He was well liked and widely respected in the climbing community, said Ang Tshering Sherpa of theNepalMountaineering Association, adding that Kanchha “was full of energy and even after retiring and in his old age, he was trekking to monasteries all over the Everest region for religious ceremonies”.View image in fullscreenThe 1953 Everest expedition.Photograph: Royal Geographical Society/GettyTenzingdied in 1986; Hillarydied in 2008.Kanchha was born in 1933 in the village of Namche in the Everest foothills, when most members of Nepal’s Sherpa community earned a living by farming potatoes and herding yaks.He spent his childhood and young adult years trading potatoes in neighbouring Tibet. When he and several friends later visited Darjeeling, India, he was persuaded to train for mountain climbing and began working with foreign trekkers.Kanchha began mountaineering when he was 19 and remained active in the expedition sector until the age of 50.In 1953, his father’s friendship with Norgay helped Kanchha secure a job as a high-altitude porter for Tenzing and Hillary when they made the world’s first summit of Everest.He was one of three Sherpas who reached the last camp below the summit, above the 7,900-metre South Col, and heard of the successful ascent on the radio. The three Sherpas were reunited with Tenzing and Hillary back at Camp 2 at about 6,400 metres.“We all gathered at Camp 2 but there was no alcohol so we celebrated with tea and snacks,” he said. “We then collected whatever we could and carried it to base camp.”View image in fullscreenIn an interview last year, Kanchha Sherpa expressed concerns about overcrowding and pollution on Everest.Photograph: Feng Wei Photography/GettyKanchha made other Everest climbs over the years, reaching various altitudes.In an interview with the Associated Press in March 2024, he expressed concerns about overcrowding and filth at the world’s highest peak. He urged people to respect the mountain, revered as the mother goddess Qomolangma among the Sherpas. Members of the community generally perform religious rituals before climbing the peak.“It would be better for the mountain to reduce the number of climbers,” he said. “Qomolangma is the biggest god for the Sherpas. But people smoke and eat meat and throw them on the mountain.”Kanchha is survived by his wife, four sons, two daughters and grandchildren.Explore more on these topicsMount EverestMountaineeringNepalSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Due to his employment with the state department and the Pentagon, Tellis had a top secret security clearance.Tellis is alleged to have entered the US state department and a defence department facility and to have “printed on government computers, or asked a colleague to print, classified documents on topics including US military aircraft capabilities”.The FBI has also accused Tellis of meeting Chinese officials on multiple occasions over the years and handing over documents in an envelope.Tellis has denied the charges. In a statement, his lawyers said: “Ashley J Tellis is a widely respected scholar and senior policy adviser. We will be vigorously contesting the allegations brought against him, specifically any insinuation of his operating on behalf of a foreign adversary.”Tellis had served in the US foreign service and is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington thinktank, where he had become a well-known strategic expert on US-India relations.View image in fullscreenDue in part to his work at the Pentagon, Tellis had top security clearance.Photograph: Daniel Slim/AFP/GettyIn India, where Tellis was born and was a regular commentator on foreign policy, news of his arrest ignited a political storm. “The forces working against India are beginning to unravel in ways few could have imagined,” said Amit Malviya, the head of the IT cell – a digital and social media arm – of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who had objected to Tellis’s critical writings on some BJP policies.Trump administration officials, including the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, have vowed to prosecute individuals who mishandle classified information.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The study found 60 fraud cases, ranging from £100 to £428,249.Most of the scams (85%) emerged from relationships built by the fraudsters on social media and dating sites. In one case, a firm failed to identify fraud when six payments totalling more than £131,000 were sent overseas.In almost half of the cases, the victims did not give the real reason for payments. In another fraud that went through, a victim made 15 international payments, worth £190,000, and claimed to be buying international property. But the staff handling the transactions did not seek documentation or question the use of multiple accounts in different names, said the report.The FCA report said some firms did not properly safeguard victims after the fraud emerged, even though there were clear signs they were vulnerable. “For example, one victim expressed suicidal thoughts and another received threats of violence from the fraudster,” it said.The watchdog said banks and payment providers could bring in measures to better protect customers, including improved monitoring systems, better training for staff and providing compassionate aftercare.‘I can’t meet, I’m on an oil rig’: the signs it might be a romance fraudRead moreSteve Smart, the FCA’s joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, described romance fraud as a “vicious crime”, adding: “All too often it is the vulnerable that fall victim. The impact – financially and personally – can be devastating.”Fraudsters typically try to identify peoplewho are lonely or isolated. They often claim to be working abroad, and are therefore unable to meet, and say they need money to fund a medical emergency.Santander has said it has seen almost £5.5m stolen through romance frauds since the start of the year. Michelle Pilsworth, the bank’s head of fraud, said the criminals increasingly ask for gift cards from victims.The consumer group Which? said banks and payment operators that fail to protect customers should have action taken against them.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeScamsBanco SantanderConsumer affairsCrimeBankingFinancial Conduct AuthoritynewsShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer wants to make carrying a digital ID mandatory for anyone wanting or needing to prove their right to work in the UK by the end of this parliament.That plan sparked cross-party opposition and a 2.9 million-signature petition calling for it to be dropped. But the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, this week complained of “scaremongering” and said digital IDs would not be used to track citizens and “there will be no pooling of people’s private information into a single, central dataset”.View image in fullscreenVeterans will be able to hold the credential in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login.Photograph: SuppliedMinisters hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security. Kendall said it “will help remove barriers, reduce red tape and make it easier for people to access the public services they need”.The Royal British Legion, the veterans’ charity that sells poppies, called the card “a positive development” and said it could improve access to services and benefits for the armed forces communities. But other veterans oppose it. Stephen Kent, the media director of Veterans Association UK, a small not-for-profit members’ group, said: “We don’t need it. It’s not for what Labour says it’s for …. A lot of veterans don’t like the idea of it [and that they] are using us as an experiment.”Veterans will be able hold the credential in a smartphone app calledGov.uk One Login. The government had previously said digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be held in an app called the Gov.uk Wallet. It now says it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more government-issued credentials become available digitally.‘Reverse Midas touch’: Starmer plan prompts collapse in support for digital IDsRead moreThe credential will be stored under encryption in the app in a similar way to a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet. Verification by face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it and the government says it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence and when more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app so there is no central database of all ID data creating what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.The Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party have all opposed the digital ID plan. Labour opponents include the MP Richard Burgon, who said it threatened “civil liberties and our data security and [creates] the risk of our data being handed over to US tech giants”.Kendall told parliament on Monday the government “absolutely will not” hand over control of any digital ID system containing information about people’s lives. Ministers have said they expect it to be built by the government’s in-house digital services department. Industry estimates suggest it could cost about £1bn to set up.Kendall also ruled out the system ever allowing the government to track location, consumer spending habits or social media activity. And she said that at no stage in the future would people be required by the police to produce the digital ID. MPs have voiced fears it could be weaponised by future governments.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyIdentity cardsBritish armyMilitaryUK civil libertiesAppsnewsShareReuse this content"

Her capacity for empathy, and compassion towards people, animals and those less fortunate, was immeasurable.“She was a protector, a voice for the voiceless and a beacon of love in a world that often forgets the importance of kindness.“Georgina will be forever remembered and loved for her funny, caring nature and being unapologetically herself.“Our lives have been changed irrevocably by her loss, and she is missed beyond measure, which is an absolute testament to the person she was. Beautiful, inside and out.”Birtwistle has also been charged with a further six counts of assault and one count of controlling and coercive behaviour in relation to three other women.At the brief hearing, he was bailed until his next court appearance. Magistrates imposed conditions on his bail, which stated he must not make contact with any of the other three alleged victims, must live at a specific address, and must surrender his passport at a police station.Birtwistle, who was not asked to enter a plea, is due to appear at Wolverhampton crown court on 13 November for a plea and case management hearing.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets.“The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.”The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the decision was a “national disgrace” and urged Starmer to reverse it.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Villa saidthe local safety advisory group had instructed the club that “no away fans will be permitted”.“The club are in continuous ­dialogue with Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local authorities throughout this ongoing process, with the safety of supporters attending the match and the safety of local residents at the forefront of any decision,” Villa said.There was significant unrest when Maccabi played Ajax on 7 ­November. A report by Dutch police into the ­disorder, which lasted two days, found that Maccabi fans had torn a Palestinian flag down from the facade of a local building and burned it, shouted “Fuck you, Palestine”and vandalised a taxi, among a series of incidents before the fixture. After the match, what were described by Amsterdam’s mayor as a series of “hit-and-run” assaults on Maccabi fans, led to five people being taken to hospital and a further 20 to 30 being slightly injured. Sixty-two people were arrested, mainly for ­public order offences.The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, posted on X: “Shameful decision! I call on the UK ­authorities to reverse this coward decision!” The Palestine Solidarity Campaign said the match should be cancelled, writing on X: “Israeli football teams shouldn’t play in international tournaments whilst it commits genocide and apartheid.”The Independent MP forBirmingham Perry Barr, Ayoub Khan, said: “I welcome the Safety Advisory Group’s decision. With so much hostility and ­uncertainty around the match, it was only right to take drastic measures.”Ajax were prevented last month from having fans at a Champions League match in Marseille after the French interior ministry banned “anyone claiming to be an Ajax Amsterdam supporter” from ­travelling between the French border and the southern city. Ajax said they had been informed the decision had been taken “on grounds of public safety and security”.The same week, the prefecture of Naples prevented the selling of tickets to Eintracht Frankfurt fans hoping to travel to their Champions League match against Napoli.Uefa said: “In all cases, the competent local authorities remain responsible for decisions related to the safety and security of matches taking place on their territory, such decisions being determined on the basis of thorough risk assessments, which vary from match to match and take into consideration previous circumstances.”Explore more on these topicsMaccabi Tel AvivAston VillaEuropa LeagueBirminghamnewsShareReuse this content"

It felt like a classic album, one that will take pride of place in record collections for years to come.”Fender, 31, grew up in North Shields, close to where the award ceremony was held this year, inNewcastle.He broke through quickly with his debut album Hypersonic Missiles in 2019, which topped the UK album chart, then consolidated its epic yet poignant sound on second album Seventeen Going Under (2021), and again with People Watching, released in February.It has taken him to even greater commercial heights, producing two Top 10 singles and prompting a series of stadium concerts.Accepting the award to the sound of Newcastle United chants in the crowd, Fender said: “We did not expect this at all … I want to say thank you, because I never did, to the person the song People Watching is about: Annie Orwin, who’s up there.”Fender has previously described Orwin, an actor, as “like a surrogate mother” to him, and the lyrics of the song People Watching reflect on his visits to see her in the care home where she eventually died in 2023. He performed the song at the ceremony.This year’s Mercury prize shortlist featured a number of commercially successful albums alongside somewhat lesser-known names.People Watching, Wolf Alice’s The Clearing and Pulp’s comeback album More all topped the UK album chart, while CMAT’s Euro-Country, FKA twigs’ Eusexua, Fontaines DC’s Romance and PinkPantheress’s Fancy That all reached the Top 3. Bookmakers had CMAT as the favourite, followed byFontaines DCand Pulp.Also nominated were Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon, rapper Pa Salieu, jazz-funk artist Emma-Jean Thackray, and Welsh jazz pianist Joe Webb.View image in fullscreenMartin Carthy on the Mercury prize’s red carpet.Photograph: JMEnternational/Getty ImagesThe prize also had its oldest ever nominee: English folk singerMartin Carthy, 84, recognised for his album Transform Me Then Into a Fish.Carthy’s career stretches back to the early 1960s London, where he influenced Bob Dylan, teaching him the standard Scarborough Fair. He later made recordings with his wife, Norma Waterson, and their daughter Eliza Carthy followed them into folk music, earning two Mercury prize nominations of her own in 1998 and 2003.Martin and Eliza performed a version of Scarborough Fair together, with sitar player Sheema Mukherjee, at the ceremony. Alon, Fender,FKA twigs, Pulp, Salieu, Thackray, Webb and Wolf Alice each also performed a song live.CMAT was also in attendance, but did not perform due to recent treatment to two wisdom teeth. “I was thinking about making jewellery from them,” she told BBC 6 Music. “I want to make the other nominees kiss my teeth for good luck, but not tell them it’s my good luck.”Wolf Alice became the first act to be nominated for each of their first four albums. Both they andPulphave one win from four nominations.In 2024, the Mercury prize seemed to be in a somewhat parlous state, after it failed to secure an event sponsor and had to make do with a scaled-back awards show without live performances.But it has returned strongly in 2025, relocating to Newcastle and using the city’s Utilita Arena as a venue. It also hosted an array of “Mercury fringe” events in the days prior to the award ceremony, with artist showcases, workshops and panel discussions.Guardian analysisof recent winners found that between 2014 and 2023, every winner hailed from London, with Leeds band English Teacher finally bringing a win from outside the capital in 2024.The move to Newcastle, which helps to counter a generally London-centric music industry, has therefore been praised. Ian Murray, minister for creative industries, media and arts, said the “symbolic step” was “hugely welcome … for too long other regions have had to play second fiddle to London, despite having world-class creative output in their own right”.View image in fullscreenSam Fender and band celebrate their win.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThe Mercury prize is voted for by a team of music industry figures: jazz musician and broadcaster Jamie Cullum; radio DJs Sian Eleri, Jamz Supernova, Mistajam, and Danielle Perry; journalists Phil Alexander, Will Hodgkinson and Sophie Williams; music consultant Lea Stonhill; and the chair of the judges, Jeff Smith, head of music at BBC Radio 2 and Radio 6 Music.The prize, founded in 1992, is described as a “celebration of the 12 albums of the year, recognising artistic achievement across a range of contemporary music genres”. The most nominated artists are Radiohead and Arctic Monkeys, each with five, while PJ Harvey is the only artist to have won it twice.Fender wins £25,000 prize money. The judges’ statement added that People Watching is “melody-rich and expansive, marrying heartland rock with the realities of everyday life and the importance of community. These are thoughtful songs with broad appeal, as cinematic as they are intimate.”Explore more on these topicsMercury prizeAwards and prizesSam FenderPulpCMATFontaines DCFKA twigsnewsShareReuse this content"

The posting typically lasts three years.A source told Reuters that there had been tension between the four-star commander and Hegseth as well as questions about whether he would be fired in the days leading up to the announcement.The New York Timesreportsthat an unnamed US official said that Holsey “had raised concerns about the mission and the attacks on the alleged drug boats”.In a statement shared on social media, Hegseth did not disclose the reason for Holsey’s plan “to retire at year’s end”.“On behalf of the Department of War,” Hegseth said, referring to his rebrand of the department’s name, “we extend our deepest gratitude to Admiral Alvin Holsey for his more than 37 years of distinguished service to our nation as he plans to retire at year’s end.”The post also noted that Holsey began his career “through the NROTC program at Morehouse College in 1988”. Morehouse is a private, historically Black college in Atlanta.In a statementsharedby the US southern command’s X account, Holsey said he planned to retire from the navy on 12 December after a career spanning nearly four decades.

When we asked them to rescind the order, it cut print entirely.”Rodenbush confirmed toNBC Newson Thursday that he was fired on Tuesday.Inrecent weeks, there had been disagreements between university leadership, IDS editors and Rodenbush over what content could appear in the print paper, according to theIndianapolis Star.“If you’re telling them that you can’t put this in the paper on campus, it’s the literal definition of censorship,” Rodenbush said in a meeting on 25 September with other IDS professional staff members, according to a recording obtained by the Star. “It cannot come from me, and it cannot come from you.”Rodenbush told NBC News that Indiana University had previously announced it would reduce the paper’s print frequency from weekly to seven per semester. He said that he was told the school wanted to focus on “special” print editions that were more profitable.But, he said, administrators went further and told him this fall that print editions could no longer include news content. The IDS’s website still publishes news.The next print issue was due to go out on Thursday, but the editors insteadreleased a digital copyonline, according to theirletter. The front page features the words “CENSORED” in large red letters, with a subhead that reads: “This is not about print. This is about a breach of editorial independence.”“We are alarmed, but not shocked, by this media School administration’s decision to terminate Jim based on his commitment to defending our First Amendment rights,” student editors-in-chief Mia Hilkowitz and Andrew Miller said in a statement to the Indianapolis Star.“All media school and IU students, faculty and staff should be scared by this blatant attack on someone standing up for what’s right.”Rodenbush told the same outlet that he “was terminated because I was unwilling to censor student media. 100%. I have no reason to believe otherwise.”In a statement on Thursday, an Indiana University spokesperson told the Guardian that the university “is committed to a vibrant and independent student media ecosystem”.“As part of the 2024 action plan for student media, the campus is shifting resources from print to digital media, prioritizing student experiences that are more consistent with today’s digital-first media environment while also addressing a longstanding structural deficit at the Indiana Daily Student,” the statement read.“Editorial control remains fully with IDS leadership, and the university will continue to work closely with them to ensure the strength, sustainability and independence of student media at IU.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bolton has been charged with sending diary entries to two unnamed individuals about his day-to-day activities when he was national security adviser, many of which contained highly classified information.The indictment marked the third time in recent weeks the justice department has secured criminal charges against one of Trump’s critics.In response to a question about the charges, Trump told reporters on Thursday that he was not aware of them but that Bolton was a “bad guy”.While Bolton parted on sour terms from the White House, the criminal investigation gained momentum during the Biden administration over disclosures that troubled the US intelligence community.The justice department pursues Espionage Act cases in the event of so-called “aggregating factors”: willful mishandling of classified information, vast quantities of classified information to support an inference of misconduct, disloyalty to the US and obstruction.“BOLTON took detailed notes documenting his day-to-day meetings, activities, and briefings. Frequently, BOLTON handwrote these notes on yellow notepads throughout his day at the White House complex or in other secure locations, and then later re-wrote his notes in a word processing document,” the indictment said.“The notes that BOLTON sent to Individuals 1 and 2 using his non-governmental personal email accounts and messaging account described in detail BOLTON’s daily activities as the National Security Advisor. Often, BOLTON’s notes described the secure setting or environment in which he learned the national defense and classified information that he was memorializing in his notes.”In a statement, Bolton said, “I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.”Bolton’s lawyer Abbe Lowell said his client had not engaged in wrongdoing.“These charges stem from portions of Ambassador Bolton’s personal diaries over his 45-year career – records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to theFBIas far back as 2021,” Lowell said in a statement. “Like many public officials throughout history, Ambassador Bolton kept diaries – that is not a crime.”The indictment said Bolton used personal email accounts and a group chat that existed during and after his time as national security adviser to share notes and diary entries that contained classified information to two people who did not have security clearances.“On or about September 24, 2019, fourteen days after he was no longer employed as the National Security Advisor, BOLTON left the messaging chat group with Individuals 1 and 2 that he had used to send them more than a thousand pages of notes memorializing his time as National Security Advisor,” the indictment said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They retrieved boxes of papers, computer files and other materials. Court filings related to the case later showed some of those materials with low-level classification markings.The emails and notes were sent by Bolton in order to produce a compendium of his time as national security adviser for his 2020 memoir, The Room Where It Happened, which angered Trump officials because of his critical behind-the-scenes look into the administration.Trump has dispensed with decades-long norms designed to insulate federal law enforcement from political pressures. In recent months, he has actively pushed attorney general Pam Bondi’s justice department to bring charges against his perceived adversaries includingformer FBI director James Comeyand New Yorkattorney general Letitia James, even driving out a prosecutor he deemed to be moving too slowly in doing so.Shortly before Bolton’s book was published, the previous Trump administrationsued to delay its releaseciting a classification review. The justice department also opened a criminal investigation into whether Bolton mishandled classified information by disclosing certain details in the book.The Biden justice department initially dropped the lawsuit and grand jury investigation in 2021. They later reopened the investigation as the US intelligence community learned more about Bolton’s emails through a foreign spy service, according to people familiar with the matter.Earlier this year, John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, conferred with Kash Patel, the FBI director, about the Bolton’s emails and how they appeared to have been transcriptions of classified material. The briefing appeared to spur renewed interest in investigating Bolton, the people said.Explore more on these topicsJohn BoltonTrump administrationUS national securityFBIDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The labor department, the treasury and the health department will on Thursday also release guidance on how employers can legally create the option.However,Republicanswho spoke at Trump’s announcement framed the benefit as a “recommendation”, indicating that employers will not be required to offer the coverage nor receive government subsidies for doing so. They also stressed that the benefit will be structured to give employers immense flexibility to determine what will or will not be covered.Without new incentives to offerIVFcoverage, it is unclear how many employers will ultimately support it.Trump, who has called himself the “fertilization president”, made support for infertility treatments a majorpart of his re-election campaign, especially after the nation erupted in outrage when the Alabama supreme courtdeemedembryos “extrauterine children”. Because IVF can lead to the creation of unused or discarded embryos, that decision temporarily forced many Alabama IVF providers tostop working.Yet in the months since taking office, the Trump administration has remained quiet on the issue. In February, hesignedanexecutive orderdirecting the administration’s domestic policy council to make recommendations to “aggressively” reduce the price tag of IVF, which often costs tens of thousands of dollars and is frequently not covered by insurance.A detailed report on the recommendations was supposed to be made public by May. No report ever emerged.IVF is life-changing for infertile families. But the Christian right says it’s not in ‘God’s plan’Read moreWhile IVF is extremely popular among Americans, the GOP’s deep ties to the anti-abortion movement have made it something of a political landmine among elected Republicans. The movement has long opposed IVF, as advocates believe that embryos are people.White House officials have in recent months discussed the possibility of supportingrestorative reproductive medicine (RRM), a constellation of therapies that purport to restore people’s “natural” fertility.Although RRM is popular among anti-abortion advocates and adherents of the “make America healthy again” movement, several major medical organizations say there is little quality evidence that RRM is more effective at helping people have babies than mainstream fertility medicine.Trump did not mention RRM in his Thursday address. When a reporter asked if he had any thoughts on anti-abortion activists’ opposition to IVF, Trump said: “I think this is very pro-life.”Pronatalist rhetoric, which holds that having children is important to a county’s wellbeing and that the state should incentivize people to procreate, dominated the press conference that followed Trump’s address. Robert F Kennedy, the health and human services secretary, highlighted the falling US birthrate, while Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, claimed that Kennedy and Trump are “great leaders” because they have big families.People who want more children but can’t have them, Oz added, are “under-babied”.“There’s gonna be a lot of Trump babies,” Oz said. “It turns out the fundamental creative force in society is about making babies.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpIVFUS politicsFertility problemsReproductionReproductive rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has fallen substantially from its peak ofover 9%in 2022 but remains uncomfortably ahead of the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%.The poll’s findings echo those of the Yale Budget Lab, whose economists have calculated that households will see an averageincreaseof $2,300 in costs a year due to Trump’s tariffs – an average of $191 per month. That research calculates overall price level increases and the effect the increases will have on average household income figures.A graph showing the inflation rate from 2016 to 2025.Many believe the 2024 presidential election was areferendumon Biden’s economy. Inflation soared in the years after the pandemic while wages struggled to keep up, leaving many Americans feeling like their paychecks were losing power. While the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, fought to present a new economic vision focused on costs, for many voters it was too late.But with just over a year until the midterm elections, Trump’s economy isn’t looking much brighter. A slight majority (54%) of Americans said they believed the economy was in a recession, five percentage points more than Harris’s Guardian polllast September. The majority of Americans (53%) also think the economy is getting worse, compared with 48% who said the same last year.Inflation was rated as the biggest risk to theUS economywhen those polled were asked to pick one issue from a list of threats, including immigration, US democracy and tariffs. Inflation was the top risk for Republicans (31%) and independents (33%), and it was the second biggest risk for Democrats (29%), behind tariffs.A bar chart showing what respondents perceived as biggest risk to the US economyBut the parties diverge over where they see the cracks. Immigration was the second biggest risk for Republicans, with 20% saying it was the biggest risk to the economy, compared with just 8% ofDemocratsand independents. Meanwhile, tariffs were a big risk for many Democrats (31%) and independents (24%).When asked about the driving force behind price increases, Republicans were far more likely (45%) to say they were standard yearly changes due to inflation, compared with 22% of Democrats and 27% of independents. Meanwhile, 55% of Democrats and 55% of independents said they thought price increases were driven by current economic policies set out by the government. About the same percentage of people across the political spectrum, slightly over 20%, said the changes were caused by businesses overcharging customers to boost profits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last September, when Biden was still president, independents were more aligned with Republicans on pessimism around the economy. The pessimism probably lent itself to votes for Trump: though independents weresplitbetween Trump and Biden in 2024, the group had favored Biden by 9% in the 2020 election, according to the Pew Research Center.But while dissatisfaction over the economy was a boon for Republicans last election, it may not translate to an easy pathway to the midterms for Democrats.The poll showed that the pessimism about the economy among independents, though shared with Democrats, doesn’t necessarily translate to support for the party.Among all those polled, optimism for the Democratic party (25%) has dropped since last September (37%), while pessimism (39%) has increased.Pessimism is slightly higher for Republicans (41%) compared with last year, while optimism for the Republican party has stayed the same since last year, just over 30%.Boosts to Republican optimism come from within the party: among Republicans, 60% said they were optimistic for their party, compared with 42% of Democrats who said the same about their own party.Pessimism among independents is higher for the Republican party this year (43%) compared with last year (33%), though it’s now about the same as those also pessimistic about the Democratic party (41%).But despite the decline in support for Democrats, economic policies coming from Democrats’ policies, including a federal ban on price gouging for food and grocery prices, expanding the child tax credit, and increasing tax rates on long-term capital gains for millionaires, are still popular among voters, and are far more popular than policies that Trump ran on and has implemented. The support for Democratic policies mirrorsresultsthat were seen last September.The ban on price gouging, which was proposed by Harris’s campaign, was still the most popular policy, with 45% of Americans saying it would strengthen the economy. Trump’s top policy, with 43% support, was eliminating taxes on social security – something his administration has yet to act on.Despite being the core of Trump’s economic agenda, mass deportation of migrants (24%), tax cuts (22%) and tariffs on foreign goods (22%) were some of the least popular policies.This survey was conducted online within the USbythe Harris Poll from 11 to 13 September2025, among a nationally representative sample of 2,093 USadults.Explore more on these topicsInflationTrump administrationDonald TrumpTrump tariffsTariffsDemocratsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

More than half – 53% – believe theeconomyis worsening, according to the latest surveyconducted by Harrisfor the Guardian. That’s just slightly better than the 58% who thought it was going downhill in late April, when financial markets were still reeling from the president’s “liberation day” tariffs. About 60% think the cost of living has gotten worse since the start of the year; 47% say the job market is worse.There is a partisan bias to responses, of course. Only 24% ofRepublicansthink the economy is deteriorating, compared with 60% of independents and 67% ofDemocrats. But there are ominous signs that the bad vibes are seeping into the bloodstream of the Maga base. Half of rural Americans, whovotedfor Trump by the stupendous margin of 69% to 29% last November, have become more pessimistic about the state of the economy since the start of the summer.Bad vibes are starting to pollute their aspirations. More than a third (38%) of rural Americans say they are more pessimistic about their ability to achieve the American dream than they were a few months ago, while only 25% are more optimistic. By contrast, urban Americans – who, according to Trump, should be cowering under their beds, desperately awaiting the national guard to rescue their cities from crime and squalor – have become more optimistic than pessimistic by a margin of 41% to 28%.75% of Americans report soaring prices as Trump claims inflation ‘over’Read morePessimism is also beating optimism by 38% to 26% among Americans with less than a four-year college degree, another bastion of the Maga base, who voted for the president by a margin of 56% to 42%. Americans with at least a bachelor’s degree are feeling sunnier: 43% report more optimism and only 26% more pessimism about their odds.The Guardian’s polling is consistent with other sources, such as the University of Michigan’sconsumer sentimentindex – which shows a sharp deterioration since the beginning of the year. It also poses somewhat of a conundrum, for American gloom is in tension with Americans’ immediate economic reality.Though it has slowed somewhat from last year, theUS economyis growing at a steady clip. While somewhat higher than last year, the unemployment rate still remains just slightly over 4%, near its historical lows.The sharpest contrast is that between Americans’ pessimism and the blistering performance of the stock market. Despite Trump’s destabilizing effect on financial markets, the S&P 500 is up by about 13% this year, driven by the surge in investment in and enthusiasm over artificial intelligence (AI). This is providing a healthy boost to household balance sheets. Still, 37% of respondents to the Guardian poll reported that their financial security was getting worse, while only 25% said it was getting better.Some commentators suggest the disconnect between a tech-driven stock market boom and Americans’ financial gloom might be due to the nature of the technology driving it. During the dotcom boom, the previous era of tech-powered financial extravagance, people were excited about all the new things the internet would bring about. Today the message from Silicon Valley to the great unwashed is that AI is coming for all our jobs, and perhaps human civilization itself.I would argue for more mundane explanations. To begin with, what prosperity we see is driven by a very narrow set of companies – seven, to be precise – which are investing hand over fist to develop ever more powerful AI models. Beyond these seven, business investment is weak. While unemployment has not risen, employment has barely grown in the last few months.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His erratic policymaking has delivered powerful blows to salient parts of the economy. China has responded to the barrage of American tariffs by cutting off access to rare earth minerals and sharply curtailing its purchases of soybeans from the US,hurting farmersacross the midwest. Moreover, Trump’s own Department of Laboris warningthat the crackdown on immigration is creating a labor crunch in the fields that threatens the food supply.Beyond the policies, Trump’s peculiar affinity for stoking indignation and resentment surely cannot help. Not a day passes that the president fails to convince his fellow citizens they are living through hell: foreign countries are abusing Americans by selling them cheap stuff. Migrant workers are bringing desolation to their communities. DEI. policies and liberal universities are brainwashing them. Democratic-run cities, meaning most of them, are cesspits of crime. And the economy is being destroyed by a recalcitrant Fed that doesn’t do the president’s bidding.One might expect a rational politician who promised to shut down the US border would take a victory lap and offer some happy talk about his success at slashing the number of immigrants toa historical low. (A sane politician might de-emphasize the fight against immigration: only 11% of Americans think immigration amounts to the biggest risk to the economy, according to the Guardian poll. That’s fewer even than the 12% who believe income inequality is the top threat.)That wouldn’t fit Trump’s style, though. He must keep ratcheting up the heat, repeatedly claiming the United States is under siege by murderous people from abroad. He is sending the national guard on to the streets of Democratic cities and threatening more military deployments on American soil. Given the mood in the air, one might forgive the average American for taking a grim view.Explore more on these topicsUS economyDonald TrumpInflationTrump administrationEconomicsUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Shares of Jefferies Financial Group were down 9% for the day.The sell-off knocked the wider market, with the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.7% and the Dow Jones down 0.6% in New York.The regional banking industry has been under scrutiny after First Brands, an auto parts supplier,filedfor chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September over creditor concerns.First Brands: why a maker of spark plugs and wiper blades has Wall Street worriedRead moreIn its bankruptcy filing, First Brands disclosed that it had at least $10bn to $50bn in liabilities against $1bn to $10bn in assets, the product of what appeared to be risky off-balance-sheet financing.Amid the bankruptcy, First Brands’ creditors filed an emergency court filing saying that $2.3bn of the company’s assets had “simply vanished”.Prosecutors at the justice department said they wereinvestigatingthe bankruptcy, and regional banks have faced intense scrutiny in light of what some worry were questionable lending practices.Jefferies, a regional bank, and UBS said they had hundreds of millions of dollars in exposure to First Brands. Shares in Jefferies have fallen 25% over the past month.In the aftermath, some experts have pointed out the bankruptcy shows cracks in the system that allows for “shadow banking” – when a borrower turns to private services outside the traditional banking system to get financing. In the case with First Brands, the company gave lenders unpaid invoices as a form of collateral.On a call with analysts on Tuesday, JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon,saidhis “antenna goes up when things like that happen”.“I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” he said. “Everyone should be forewarned on this.”Explore more on these topicsBankingBankruptcy and IVAsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

I probably shouldn’t say this but when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more. And so everyone should be forewarned at this point,” Dimon said.JP Morgan boss says more ‘cockroaches’ will emerge after private credit sector failuresRead moreGeorgieva said the IMF was being “very watchful”, but argued that “so far, not that many cockroaches” had been spotted.She said she was encouraged that countries across the globe had better policy frameworks than were in place before the global financial crisis of 2008, while “systemically significant economies” had accumulated massive reserves to cope with problems.But, she cautioned that many countries had exhausted their fiscal buffers, meaning they had little budget headroom to handle a financial crisis, while central banks were still battling inflation, and she urged vigilance over the non-bank sector.“In this environment, of course, the security blanket is covering us, but maybe we have a foot out in the cold. We have to be vigilant. What do we do? We watch it very carefully,” Georgieva said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will do this with respect and transparency.”Navratil, who replaced Laurent Freixe last month after he was fired forfailing to disclose a romantic relationship with a subordinate, announced an acceleration of his predecessor’s cost-saving plan to free up cash.The company, which owns consumer goods brands including Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, Nespresso coffee capsules and Purina cat food, will seek to make savings of 3bn Swiss francs (£2.8bn) by 2027, up from a previous target of 2.5bn francs.Freixe’s firing, which was followed two weeks later by the resignation of the chair, Paul Bulcke, destabilised a company that was already under pressure to bolster growth and reduce debt.“We will be bolder in investing at scale and driving innovation to deliver accelerated growth and value creation,” Navratil said. “We are fostering a culture that embraces a performance mindset, that does not accept losing market share, and where winning is rewarded.”Nestlé employed nearly 4,200 staff in the UK at the end of last year, according to company filings. Its UK head office is in Gatwick, and it has a production facility in York that makes KitKats.The company would not give details about the scale of job losses in individual countries, but said it wanted to increase efficiencies across the group, including automating more of its work processes.The cuts were announced as the company reported a 1.9% year-on-year fall in sales to 65.9bn francs in the first nine months of the year. It said this was primarily due to negative foreign exchange impacts of 5.4% and that, on an organic basis, sales grew by 3.3%.“We have been stepping up investment to achieve this, and the results are starting to come through,” Navratil said. “Now we must do more and move faster to accelerate our growth momentum.“As Nestlé moves forward, we will be rigorous in our approach to resource allocation, prioritising the opportunities and businesses with the highest potential returns.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In rare earths, the administration would also set price floors and strategic stockpiles.Under Donald Trump, the US has shifted from subsidies to direct stakes in companies including Intel Corp, minerals miner Trilogy Metals and rare earths miner MP Materials.“We’re not going to come in and take stakes in non-strategic industries, but we’ve identified seven industries” to develop domestically, Bessent said. The government had to be “very careful not to overreach” and to ensure that investments were meeting its strategic goals, he added.Bessent spoke days after Beijing announced fresh controls on the export of rare earth technologies and items, leading Trump to threaten 100% tariff on goods from China starting on 1 November. China is the world’s leading producer of the minerals used to make magnets crucial to the auto, electronic and defence industries.US trade representative Jamieson Greer warned at a Wednesday press briefing that US plans for a tariff hike or other export controls were in the works.“China’s announcement [on export controls] is nothing more than a global supply chain power grab,” he said. “This move is not proportional retaliation. It is an exercise in economic coercion on every country in the world.”Bessent said US and Chinese officials were in touch to set up a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping, adding that it was the level of trust between the two leaders that had prevented a further escalation of the trade conflict.The US does not want to decouple from China, but would have to take action if Beijing proved to be an unreliable supplier, Bessent said, noting that Chinese officials recently told US auto companies that a slowdown in shipments of rare earth magnets was “probably something” to do with a holiday.“Not only is China fuelling Russia’s war [in Ukraine], but China’s actions have once again demonstrated the risk of being dependent on them, on rare earths and for that matter, anything,” Bessent said, adding, “If China wants to be an unreliable partner to the world, then the world will have to decouple.”With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificMiningInternational tradeGlobal economyTrump administrationUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Under laboratory tests, they were assumed to be 75% less polluting.The researchers analysed data from the onboard fuel consumption meters of 800,000 cars registered in Europe between 2021 and 2023. They found real-world carbon dioxide emissions from PHEVs in 2023 were 4.9 times greater than those from standardised laboratory tests, having risen from being 3.5 times greater in 2021.“Real-world emissions are going up, while official emissions are going down,” said Sofía Navas Gohlke, a researcher at Transport and Environment and the co-author of the report. “This is the gap that is getting worse and it is a real problem. As a result, PHEVs pollute almost as much as petrol cars.”The researchers attributed most of the gap to overestimates of the “utility factor” – the ratio of miles travelled in electric mode to the total miles travelled – finding that 27% of driving was done in electric mode even though official estimates assumed 84%. The European Commission has announced two corrections to the utility factor ratio that will narrow the gap but not close it entirely, according to the analysis.Even when the cars were driven in electric mode, the analysis found that levels of pollution were well above official estimates. The researchers said this was because electric motors were not strong enough to operate alone, with their engines burning fossil fuels for almost one-third of the distance travelled in electric mode.Patrick Plötz, head of energy economics at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, who was not involved in the study, said it was a “very useful contribution” after years in which parts of the automotive industry argued there was too little data to accurately assess real-world emissions.“The results demonstrate, beyond any doubt, that the gap between official and real-world PHEV fuel consumption and CO2emissions is much, much larger than for gasoline or diesel cars,” said Plötz, who has publishedresearchon the topic. “Any policy changes with respect to PHEVs should be made with utmost care and in the light of that data.”Hybrid cars have been drawn back into the political debate as carmakers have pressed the EU to weaken CO2targets. A ban on new combustion engine cars in 2035 has been subject to heavy lobbying from the automotive industry and opposition from member states with large car industries.“There must not be a drastic cut in 2035,” the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said after a summit last week with the country’s struggling automobile industry, promising to do “everything in [his] power” to achieve that. Other senior German politicians have floated plug-in hybrids as one example of possible “flexibilities” they could introduce to the legislation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They added that drivers of PHEVs would also be paying about €500 more a year in running costs than would be assumed under laboratory tests.“The bold claims that manufacturers like to make about their plug-in hybrid vehicles are clearly way off the mark,” said Colin Walker, a transport analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.“Consumers are being duped into believing that in buying a PHEV, they are helping the environment and saving money,” he said. “In reality, PHEVs are little better than regular petrol and diesel cars when it comes to the fuel they consume, the CO2they produce and the money they cost to run.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsEuropean UnionMotoringEuropeEthical and green livingGreenhouse gas emissionsAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

But UNC is letting chaos reignThe NFL’s great tactician was meant to elevate North Carolina football. Instead, his rigid ways, fraying staff and tone-deafness have made the Tar Heels a cautionary taleAndrew LawrenceThu 16 Oct 2025 09.16 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 15.12 EDTShareIt used to be that there was no stronger brand in football than a “Bill Belichick-coached” outfit. For most of his nearly 50 years in the pros, the phrase connoted teams that prepared for every scenario, executed directions to perfection and met all the moments in between to secure victory time and again. But since the NFL turned its back on Belichick, who stepped down to the college ranks and took the head job atNorth Carolinaseemingly for appearances, the Belichick-coached team slogan has become less of a mark of excellence than a bright warning label for a program run amok.The concerns at this juncture, still short of midway through Belichick’s freshman season, are overwhelming. The misleading record, the stark images of home fans deserting a blowout loss to Clemson before half-time, the dramatic talent deficit – those were predictable outcomes for a septuagenarian taskmaster trying his hand at coaching college kids. But Belichick isn’t simply out of his element. He looks for all the world to be asleep at the wheel, too.Last week the Raleigh TV station WRALdropped a bombshellabout the program that was rife with the kind of tittle-tattle and fault-finding that typically comes outaftera coach is fired. The scathing report – which included off-the-record accounts from players, parents, coaches and administrators – paints the picture of a discordant program where Belichick recruits receive preferential treatment and parent concerns are ignored altogether. As evidence of the Tar Heels’ disunity, a number of WRAL’s sources pointed to Tar Heels selling their allotment of spare tickets for cash instead of sharing them with teammates in need.If you suspect that the NCAA’s eligibility enforcers might not look kindly on player-driven ticket scalping, even in the era where amateurs have been extended a measure of economic autonomy, well, you would be right. But ultimately it was cornerbacks coach Armond Hawkins who took the fall for facilitating these “improper benefits”; last Thursday the UNC athletics department placed him on indefinite leave while it “investigates other potential actions detrimental to the team and University”, according to a school statement. As those events were coming to light, our Oliver Connolly – who, you’ll recall, was among the first to break the Belichick-to-UNC news – reported that the coach hadinitiated buyout talkswith the school, and his assistants were scrambling for the exits in hopes of landing softly at college football playoff teams. “The rats are leaving the ship,” one unnamed coach said. A defensive assistant added: “What we’ve done to these kids is fucked up.”The palace intrigue at UNC has turned an otherwise dreary road game at Cal on Friday into the football equivalent of a Bravo TV series girls trip. When will the finger-pointing start? What will be the thing that there’s no coming back from? Who will be first to throw up their hands and huff,I’m so done!? Belichick and UNC athletics director Bubba Cunningham have each put out statements reasserting their commitment to the cause, but the PR boilerplate has proven no better than a colander against an unstinting tide of bad news.Lost amid the rumors of Belichick’s UNC demise was Hulu scrapping its plans for a series following the team, a cancellation that comes six months after NFL Films reportedly pulled the plug on North Carolina-focused Hard Knocks series. The fact that these TV productions are no longer sniffing around the Tar Heels program just makes you wonder how much of a horror show the Real Coaches of UNC has become, and how bad the lot is for the kids in the locker room on a scale of one toBishop Sycamore. “We just believe very much in the process,” Belichick said in a news conference this week while addressing the rumors around the program. “Like [hall of fame coach] Bill Walsh said, ‘The score will take care of itself.’ I’ve always believed that. You’ve just gotta keep working and grinding away and that’s exactly what we’re doing.”On some level you feel for the Tar Heels, who let the winningest coach in program historywalkto try their luck with the most accomplished coach in NFL history. In theory, the decision reeks of sense. That pro CV alone would be justification enough to hire another candidate sight unseen. But Cunningham and the school’s board of trustees should have known better than to sign Belichick to a five-year, $50m contract withoutreallyconsidering who exactly they were hiring. That’s not a shot atJordon Hudson, the omnipresent girlfriend and handler who wriggled her way to the center of all the coach’s affairs. That’s an indictment of Belichick – the gridiron monk who preached against the pitfalls of off-field distractions, only to wind up turning into the biggest one.View image in fullscreenNorth Carolina football coach Bill Belichick and his girlfriend Jordon Hudson look on during the first half of the game between the Tar Heels and the Duke Blue Devils at the Dean Smith Center in March.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty ImagesBelichick hasn’t been the same mastermind without Tom Brady, posting a 29-38 coaching record with no playoff appearances in his last four seasons in New England. During that time, his apparent knack for spotting and developing talent rapidly eroded. The most promising quarterback prospect of Belichick’s last hurrah, Mac Jones, is thriving under new management in San Francisco. When Brady bolted to Tampa expressly to win a seventh Super Bowl ring and put some distance between him and his longtime coach, it seemed like a picayune point. But since Brady took the Patriot Ways and won a championship in his first year with the Buccaneers, you can’t help wondering who the mastermind really was as Belichick fumbles through his last coaching days.Whoever the Tar Heel decision-maker was that reckoned Belichick, a notoriously dour man who speaks in mumbles, would have charisma left to schmooze boosters and coachkidsat 73 years of age clearly has no idea how big league football works. It’s one thing for a middle-aged Belichick to steer a locker room full of self-motivated adults who live in perpetual fear of losing their lucrativeNFLjobs; quite another for an advanced-aged Belichick to leave it to a bunch of teenagers to figure out how much they need to watch film, reach their fitness goals and, I guess, attend classes too.Belichick’s coaching staff was supposed to impose their winning NFL ways on a wild and wooly college game, but they’ve proven no better than a depressing mix of loyalist and family members. Belichick’s righthand man is UNC general manager Mike Lombardi, a longtime lackey who reportedly madea fundraising trip to Saudi Arabiaon the program’s behalf two weeks before the season – lifting the wider concerns about sports washing andprivate equity’s incursion into college athleticsto stratospheric new heights. No one on staff seems to appreciate that the difference between wins and losses at the college level are in recruiting. Belichick was supposed to be the coach who could actually make a credible case for playing football at a basketball school; he’d only need to flash one of his Super Bowl rings, they said.But in their haste to erect the NFL’s 33rd NFL franchise, UNC higher-ups appear to have completely overlooked Belichick’s long NFL history of PR reticence, managerial clashes and cheating allegations. (Maybe the basketball team was playing?) One of Belichick’s first moves as UNC coach was toban the Patriots from scouting his team. “It’s clear I’m not welcome there at their facility. So they’re not welcome at ours,” he said, even though he had just been back to Foxborough for Brady’s Patriots hall of fame induction ceremony. Belichickreportedlyalso banned UNC social media team from posting news about Carolina alums with New England, effectively stifling them from celebrating the former Tar Heel turned Pats quarterback Drake Maye. In the college game, coaches are held up as community role models for their young players especially – but Belichick teaches all the wrong lessons with his immaturity, pettiness and grudge-holding.Even if Belichick had landed at a perennial championship contender – Georgia or Alabama, say – one suspects the results would be much the same. Belichick may have built his entire personality around being the man in charge. But his last nine months in Chapel Hill have been a reminder that he’s cut players for far less alarming reasons and wouldn’t hesitate to fire himself if he were outside the situation, making the call.If indeed UNC and Belichick part ways prematurely, the divorce could get complicated and costly. PerWRAL, Belichick could give back $1m to get out of the contract or wait for the university to fire him without cause and collect $30m. And it’s not lost on North Carolina residents that most of this money will be coming from state coffers, as UNC is a public school. But if the athletics department were to find cause to let him go – for an NCAA rules violation or mistreating players or quiet quitting on the job, to name three examples seemingly in progress already – they likely wouldn’t owe him much more than a courtesy fight in arbitration. However the relationship ends, it seems highly unlikely that an NFL or major college football team would give Belichick another chance to run the whole show.It’s for the best. For more than a half century, Belichick has been a dutiful steward of the game and been richly rewarded for his service. But the time has come for both sides to admit the error, cut ties and move on. The longer this star-crossed marriage holds up, the harder it becomes to deny what’s actually brought UNC football to this new low: the collision between a great man’s hubris and the towering gullibility of an academic bastion.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsNFLUS sportsNew England PatriotsNorth CarolinafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first edition of the World Cup in 1930 was hosted in and won by Uruguay.Fifa president Gianni Infantinomet representativesfrom Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina at Trump Tower in New York last month for the first formal discussions about a proposal that was first raised informally by the Uruguayan Football Association at a Fifa Council meeting last March.Concacaf president opposes plans for 64-team Fifa World Cup in 2030Read moreThe delegation in New York was led by Conmbol president, Paraguayan Alejandro Dominguez, and also featured the Paraguay and Uruguay heads of state, as well as the presidents of their federations and Argentina’s.Multiple sources have told the Guardian however, that they have yet to gain the support of the other Conmebol members, who are concerned about the impact of World Cup expansion on their qualifying competition, the main source of revenue for many of the national associations.South American World Cup qualifying is currently an 18-game round-robin single-table competition, with all 10 countries playing each other home and away. The top six qualify automatically, with the seventh team entering inter-confederation play-offs featuring six teams from all over the world.Such is the strength in depth in South America that Brazil finished fifth in the competition that concluded last month, while regular World Cup attendees Chile finished bottom, reflecting a competitiveness that gives the qualifiers real value in terms of TV rights and sponsorship deals. Expanding the World Cup to 64 teams would result in eight or nine South American sides being given places, raising concerns about the future of the qualifying competition.There is also understood to be a strong belief among the other Conmebol members that Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina are pursuing expansion for their own ends and would be the sole beneficiaries. During last month’s meeting in New York they proposed staging the entire group stage of the 2030 World Cup, rather than awarding additional games to other countries in South America.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Uefa president, Aleksander Čeferin, has described it as a “bad idea” that would reduce the quality of the tournament and Concacaf president, Victor Montagliani, has said “it just doesn’t feel right.”The World Cup has grown significantly in recent decades, increasing from 16 to 24 teams in 1982, growing again to 32 in 1998 before becoming a 48-team competition next summer. A 64-team World Cup would feature 128 matches, double the number played at the most recent tournament in Qatar three years ago and 24 more than next year’s World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, which will be the first time it has been staged across three countries.Any decision to expand the World Cup would be taken by Fifa’s Council, but it was not discussed at their most recent meeting in Zurich on 2 October.Explore more on these topicsWorld CupFifaWorld Cup 2030Football politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

With several clubs’ playoff hopes already in peril, there are toasty seats across the leagueOliver ConnollyThu 16 Oct 2025 08.41 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 10.13 EDTShareThe Tennessee Titans’ firing Brian Callahan this week signaled the unofficial start of the coaching carousel.Six weeks into the season, a league built for parity is finding there is little to go around. Nearly half (14) of the league’s teams this season are two games over .500. Three others have winning records and another three (the Chiefs, Panthers and Commanders) are 3-3 with an upward trajectory.On the opposite end, six teams are 1-5, with their playoff hopes all but over in October. Only one of those teams (the Saints) has a rookie head coach. Callahan was the first coach to be dismissed, but there are toasty seats across the league.Mike McDaniel, Miami Dolphins2025 Record1-5Career Record29-28For a while, McDaniel looked like the future of coaching. He was different. He was fun. He was creative. But McDaniel’s schtick has run out of steam. The Dolphins have the longest postseason drought in the league, and that’s not changing this season.After being blown out by the Colts in week one, you can at least hand this to McDaniel: his team has fought. Even after losing Tyreek Hill for the season, the Dolphins’ offense has been productive. But after anotherinexplicable late-game collapse last weekagainst the Chargers, it feels like his time has run out. The on-field product has been poor. And the vibes in Miami seem as fractured as anywhere in the league.The on-field malaise has seeped off the field. In his postgame comments to the media last week, Tua Tagovailoa exposed problems in the locker room. He criticized players for missing or arriving late to player-only meetings, as well as the team’s weekly preparation. When playersstart publicly criticizing the culture, a coach is on borrowed time.Blame for this year’s debacle should go across the organization. It was owner Stephen Ross who decided to run it back with McDaniel and GM Chris Grier this season, despite little evidence that the two could field a playoff-caliber team. Grier has assembled another disheveled roster, patching together a lopsided defense. He placed all his chips on the defensive front, leavingthe weakest secondary in the leagueexposed. McDaniel’s offense has shown signs of life since week one, but Miami’s defense has been so uncompetitive that it’s almost meaningless.The Dolphins have a manageable schedule coming up. But wins over the Browns or Falcons are unlikely to move the needle. They will only delay the inevitable. Whether it’s in-season or at the end of the year, McDaniel will be out. To finally end the 25-year hunt for a playoff win, though, the Dolphins will need more sweeping changes.Hot Seat Meter10/10View image in fullscreenMiami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel speaks after an October defeat.Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APAaron Glenn, New York Jets2025 Record0-6Career Record0-6Coaches are rarely one-and-done in theNFL. Owners are too proud. Executives aren’t keen to admit that they hired a dud. If a coach is axed after one season, it’s typically because of an off-the-field scandal or because they commit the cardinal sin: they make the team look incompetent.The Jets fired Robert Saleh last season, a defensive-minded coach whose pitch for the head coaching gig was that he would improve the team’s culture. That didn’t work. So Woody Johnson pivoted to Aaron Glenn … a defensive-minded coach whose pitch was that he would establish a new culture. So far, it’s been a complete failure.Expectations were low for the Jets this offseason. Somehow, Glenn has driven them down. They are worse defensively than at any point under Saleh, sitting 28th in EPA/Play. The offense can churn out yards in the run game, but cannot get anything going through the air unless it’s garbage time.More importantly, Glenn looks in over his head. He isn’t a scheme guru; he’s a culture-builder. He was supposed to restore accountability and competency to the building. He would say what needed to be said, and he would be on top of the little details that can be the difference in one-score games. But he’s continually flubbed his lines. Heeffectively quit on his own quarterbackat the end of the first half against the Broncos in week six, thenlit up a reporterfor asking if the coach was pondering a quarterback switch. In all six games, he has bungled timeouts, struggled to grasp the basics of end-of-half situations and coached not to lose rather than trying to win. If that were all, Glenn would likely be given time. But it’s not. His own unit has fallen off a cliff – and he’s refused to make any staffing or schematic changes to stem the bleeding.The Jets are not a talented team. But with the current roster, they shouldn’t bewinless. There is talent along the offensive line, a handful of playmakers at the skill positions and quality starters at every level of the defense, though it’s hard to tell at this stage of the season.Glenn has taken every opportunity to point back to his time in Detroit, when he was working alongside Dan Campbell. Going from laughing stock to contender was a slow build. Campbell won only three games in his first season as Detroit’s head coach. But even when losing, the Lions never looked unprepared or incompetent. The Jets do.Glenn can afford to lose more games, so long as the Jets start to look competitive. That starts with a quarterback change or an overhaul of the defense. But with a tempestuous owner, Glenn cannot afford any more management calamities.Hot Seat Meter6/10Kevin Stefanski, Cleveland Browns2025 Record1-5Career Record41-49Stefanski is a two-time Coach of the Year who is fighting for his job, thanks largely to the failings of his front office and owner.The Browns are in rebuild mode, betting on their rookie class to carry them into a new era. They are stocked with picks for next year’s draft, where they will have a chance to maneuver the board to land whichever college quarterback they prefer.Perhaps Stefanski will show enough down the stretch that he will be kept around to see through the rebuild. He continues to oversee one of the NFL’s best defenses, and if the Browns can land a serviceable quarterback in the offseason, they could compete in the AFC North next season. Stefanski has proven that with solid quarterback play, he can piece together a good offense. But he was handed the roughest of assignments last offseason, asked to work it out with a creaking Joe Flacco – who has since been traded – or a pair of mid-round rookies at quarterback. That was always going to be a recipe for fewer than 20 points a game and a losing record.By the end of the year, Stefanski will probably be the fall guy for Cleveland’s deeper failings. The Browns will hand the franchise over to a new head coach to usher in a new era with a new quarterback. But Stefanski will land a job elsewhere. The mess in Cleveland is not on him.Hot Seat Meter8/10View image in fullscreenJohn Harbaugh’s Ravens have had the worst start in his 18-year tenure.Photograph: Nick Wass/APJohn Harbaugh, Baltimore Ravens2025 Record:1-5Career Record:173-109 (One Super Bowl win)The injury-riddled Ravens dropped to 1-5 after losing 17-3 at home to the Rams last week, marking the worst start to a season in John Harbaugh’s 18-year tenure with the franchise.Baltimore hit the bye at the lowest ebb of the Harbaugh era. If they can get the bulk of their starters back from injury after the break, most notably quarterback Lamar Jackson, they could still make a playoff run. But the odds of turning the season around are dwindling. Since the current playoff format started in 2020, only one team – Washington in 2020 – has started 1-5 and made the playoffs.Harbaugh has lived a charmed life in Baltimore. Even during the years when the Ravens have faltered, the blame has never fallen on the head coach. This year is different, though. Baltimore’s defense is a mess for the second season in a row. The group sits 30th in EPA/play, behind the likes of the Titans, Jets and Bengals. Last season, the Ravens were able to turn it around at the midpoint of the year, overhauling their approach and bringing in outside help to streamline what defensive coordinator Zach Orr was trying to do.Harbaugh chose to run it back with Orr this season after falling short in the postseason. But it’s been a dud. Even before injuries took over, the Ravens’ defense was out of sorts. They struggled to get lined up, couldn’t communicate and couldn’t impact opposing quarterbacks. Harbaugh often gets a pass for a unit’s failings because he’s viewed as a former special teams coach and is billed more as a CEO-style head coach. But Harbaugh’s branding is atouchmisleading. His background is in defense. He sits in every defensive meeting and makes the critical hires. It’s on him, as much as anyone, that the unit has struggled out of the gates two years in a row.With Jackson at the apex of his powers, the Ravens are operating on a year-to-year timeline. It’s championship or bust every season. But Harbaugh is now 4-7 in the postseason since he won the Super Bowl nearly 13 years ago. And he is facing an uphill struggle even to make the playoffs this campaign.The Ravens are not a rash franchise. And it’s tough to see who on the market would be a better fit for the Ravens than Harbaugh. But if the team fails to make the postseason, there aren’t many other levers to pull than changing the head coach.Hot Seat Meter4/10Brian Daboll, New York Giants2025 Record2-4Career Record20-36-1No coach’s career is teetering as much as Daboll’s. His future rests on the arm of one player: Jaxson Dart.Daboll went into the season with a singular mandate from Giants owner John Mara: find me a quarterback. After messing around with Russell Wilson for a few weeks, Daboll finally pivoted to the rookie. And the early returns have been strong. Dart has brought electricity to a previously moribund offense, piloting the Giants to two wins in three starts, including a win over the Eagles without go-to targets Malik Nabers or Darius Slayton.Dart embodies everything Daboll wants in a quarterback: big, strong, mobile and a little reckless. While the rookie has been up-and-down in his three starts, he has undeniably brought a new jolt to the franchise.This is a proof-of-concept year for Daboll. He entered the season with the warmest seat in the league. But he finally has his own hand-picked quarterback. The schedule for the Giants the rest of the way is tough; their next nine opponents all have a current record above .500.The win-loss column will matter. It’s hard to run back a coach with 40-plus losses in four seasons. But Mara values stability and isn’t prone to rash decisions. As much as the team’s record, keeping or firing Daboll will come down to the environment. If Dart continues to show promise, if the Giants can snag another pair of upset wins and if the chemistry between the head coach and quarterback remains strong, Daboll will be given another year.Hot Seat Meter5/10Explore more on these topicsNFLMiami DolphinsNew York JetsCleveland BrownsBaltimore RavensNew York GiantsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Formenton is playing in Switzerland, though it is unclear if he has an out clause to return to the NHL, which he has not played in since 2022 with Ottawa.“Each team is going to have to make its own decision,” commissioner Gary Bettman said Wednesday after the NHL’s Board of Governors meeting in New York. “They know the rules. And it’s up to them to decide whether or not, subject to those rules, they want to move forward.”Hart is resuming his career at the age of 27 with the Golden Knights after spending his first six seasons playing for Philadelphia. The Flyers last month ruled out bringing back Hart, whose camp communicated to general manager Daniel Briere that a fresh start was a better option.The players were charged in 2024 in connection with an incident in London, Ontario, in 2018. The judge overseeing the trial said the prosecution could not meet the onus of proof to convict them and that complainant’s allegations lacked the credibility needed to justify the charges.The league conducted its own investigation beginning in the spring of 2022 when the allegations came to light. When announcing the reinstatement timeline in September, the NHL called the events that transpired “deeply troubling and unacceptable” and that while they were not found to be criminal, said the players’ conduct did not meet the standard of moral integrity.The NHLPA at the time said the players cooperated with every investigation and considers the matter closed.Explore more on these topicsVegas Golden KnightsNHLRape and sexual assaultUS sportsShareReuse this content"

He was one of three Sherpas to reach the final camp before the summit with Hillary and Tenzing.Kanchha never climbed to the summit of Everest himself as his wife considered it too risky, he said in an interview in March 2024. He also forbade his children from becoming mountaineers.He was well liked and widely respected in the climbing community, said Ang Tshering Sherpa of theNepalMountaineering Association, adding that Kanchha “was full of energy and even after retiring and in his old age, he was trekking to monasteries all over the Everest region for religious ceremonies”.View image in fullscreenThe 1953 Everest expedition.Photograph: Royal Geographical Society/GettyTenzingdied in 1986; Hillarydied in 2008.Kanchha was born in 1933 in the village of Namche in the Everest foothills, when most members of Nepal’s Sherpa community earned a living by farming potatoes and herding yaks.He spent his childhood and young adult years trading potatoes in neighbouring Tibet. When he and several friends later visited Darjeeling, India, he was persuaded to train for mountain climbing and began working with foreign trekkers.Kanchha began mountaineering when he was 19 and remained active in the expedition sector until the age of 50.In 1953, his father’s friendship with Norgay helped Kanchha secure a job as a high-altitude porter for Tenzing and Hillary when they made the world’s first summit of Everest.He was one of three Sherpas who reached the last camp below the summit, above the 7,900-metre South Col, and heard of the successful ascent on the radio. The three Sherpas were reunited with Tenzing and Hillary back at Camp 2 at about 6,400 metres.“We all gathered at Camp 2 but there was no alcohol so we celebrated with tea and snacks,” he said. “We then collected whatever we could and carried it to base camp.”View image in fullscreenIn an interview last year, Kanchha Sherpa expressed concerns about overcrowding and pollution on Everest.Photograph: Feng Wei Photography/GettyKanchha made other Everest climbs over the years, reaching various altitudes.In an interview with the Associated Press in March 2024, he expressed concerns about overcrowding and filth at the world’s highest peak. He urged people to respect the mountain, revered as the mother goddess Qomolangma among the Sherpas. Members of the community generally perform religious rituals before climbing the peak.“It would be better for the mountain to reduce the number of climbers,” he said. “Qomolangma is the biggest god for the Sherpas. But people smoke and eat meat and throw them on the mountain.”Kanchha is survived by his wife, four sons, two daughters and grandchildren.Explore more on these topicsMount EverestMountaineeringNepalSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

News of his death caused an outpouring of grief across the world and thousands of people lined the streets for his funeral.His body was found in his home in Hyde after police received a call from a concerned neighbour, later revealed to have been his manager, Paul Speak, who alongside Hatton’s son and brother, was a pallbearer at his funeral.The former world champion had been open about his struggles with clinical depression and substance abuse, saying on one occasion that he “was coming off the rails” with his drink and drug use, describing himself previously as being “like a runaway train”.The police coroner’s officer Alison Catlow told the inquest Hatton was last seen by family members on Friday 12 September, when he seemed well and there was no cause for concern.The court heard that the next day Hatton did not appear at an event that he was scheduled to attend, and on the morning of Sunday 14 September Speak went to Hatton’s home in order to escort him toManchesterairport to fly to Dubai.When he didn’t get a response, Speak entered Hatton’s home, where he “found him unresponsive” . Speak called the emergency services, but Hatton was pronounced dead.The full inquest into Hatton’s death is scheduled to begin at Manchester south coroner court on 20 March 2026.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

So, a lot of times it goes your way, and tonight it went theirs.”Toronto had four runs and eight hits as Seattle swept the first two games in Canada.“I wasn’t really executing when they got the guys on base,” Kirby said. “They’re really aggressive when that happens.”Seattle’s pitchers were sixth in the AL with a 3.87 ERA and had a 3.29 ERA in the Division Series against Detroit. Ferguson expressed confidence they quickly will return to form.“If there’s one thing we’ve done since I’ve been here,” Ferguson said, “we bounce back together well as a team and we respond well when we kind of get smacked in the face a little bit.”Explore more on these topicsMLBSeattle MarinersToronto Blue JaysBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

And why has Wirtz started slowly at Liverpool?The world of soccer throws up no shortage of questions on a regular basis. In today’s column, Graham Ruthven endeavors to answer three of themGraham RuthvenThu 16 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTShareCould Italy really missanotherWorld Cup?By the time next summer’sWorld Cupkicks off, it’ll have been 12 years since Italy last played at the tournament they have won more times (four) than any other nation besides Brazil (five) and Germany (also four). The way things are going, theAzzurri’s 12-year wait for World Cup qualification could become a 16-year one at the very least.Italy are very much still in qualification contention. Gennaro Gattuso’s side are just two points behind Norway in Group I with theAzzurristill to host Erling Haaland and co. in their final group game. That could be a single-game shootout to decide which team makes it directly to the World Cup.That Italy have missed the last two World Cups is somewhat anomalous considering theAzzurriwon Euro 2020, but their qualification drought has prompted a lot of introspection. Italian soccer’s grassroots have been examined. While the country once produced superstars purely out of habit, now it is scrambling for difference-makers at the elite level.Moise Kean has recently emerged as one such difference-maker. The Fiorentina forward has scored four in his last three outings for the national team while Mateo Retegui has also registered nine goal contributions in wins over Estonia and Israel. Gattuso, who replaced Luciano Spalletti in June, has at least sparked some life into Italy’s attack.In Italy’s last World Cup triumph two decades ago, they had more icons than a Florence galleria – Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Del Piero, Andrea Pirlo, Francesco Totti and more. Italy are a long way from that level now, no matter how their 2026 World Cup qualification campaign finishes.Why isn’t it happening for Wirtz right now?Liverpool paid $155m (£116m) to sign Florian Wirtz this summer because they believed he was a sure bet. The 22-year-old was widely considered a generational talent and the Premier League champions saw an opportunity to add to their team from a position of strength, beating Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Real Madrid to Wirtz’s signing.View image in fullscreenFlorian Wirtz has yet to score or register an assist in the Premier League this season.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty ImagesSo far, though, the $155m man has been a disappointment. Wirtz has yet to register a single goal or assist in seven Premier League appearances and has even been dropped to the bench by Arne Slot for some matches. Slot says Wirtz is “adjusting” while Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann has also defended his player.According to Nagelsmann, it’s “not his fault if his teammates don’t convert” the chances being created by Wirtz, and he might have a point. Only Cody Gakpo (14) and Mohamed Salah (12) have created more chances than Wirtz (11) for Liverpool this season. His expected assists (xA) also ranks highly.In Liverpool’s last match before the international break away to Chelsea, Wirtz carved out a glorious opportunity for Salah, pirouetting to brilliantly set up the Egyptian for a shot inside the box only for the chance to be spurned. In the game against Galatasaray before that, Wirtz had the most shots of any Liverpool player and the second-most key passes.Nonetheless, anyone who has watched Wirtz for Liverpool this season hasn’t seen the same player who lit up the Bundesliga for Bayer Leverkusen. Wirtz might be contributing more than many are giving him credit for, but those contributions so far haven’t been worth $155m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fruit (possibly lemons), however, is undeniably beginning to appear. The USMNT is finally starting to look like a Pochettino team.View image in fullscreenMauricio Pochettino has the US playing as well as they have under his tenure as manager.Photograph: Omar Vega/Getty ImagesThe USMNT, at long last and just in time, have tangible momentum before World Cup 2026Read moreThe performance in the 1-1 draw against Ecuador wastheir best to dateunder the former Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham Hotspur boss. The US played with intensity. They handled the opposition press well. There was movement and quick decision-making in the final third and an eye-catching individual display by Folarin Balogun as the No 9, the USA’s most problematic of problem positions. Haji Wright also made a case for himself bybagging a bracein the 2-1 win over Australia.For a long time, it wasn’t clear Pochettino would ever get through to his players. The Marchdefeats to Panama and Canadaleft a stench so strong that Pochettino spent the next few months airing it out. He publicly questioned the attitude of his players, including his best player after Christian Pulisic skipped the Gold Cup to rest up this summer. Performances were poor. Some were worse than that.It was only last month that Alexi Lalas suggested US Soccer should fire Pochettino. That, of course, was Lalas being Lalas, but few would have argued the Argentine was justifying his $6m-a-year salary at that point. Something, however, has changed since then and the USMNT finally has something to build on. The dread around the 2026 World Cup on home soil has eased.

Reports suggest Sean Dyche is waiting to take over, but history shows Evangelos Marinakis sways like the wind, and victory against Chelsea could be enough to save Postecoglou’s job for now. Goals have been a mounting concern for a team that have been beaten in four of their last five league matches and failed to score in any of those defeats. Failure to find their shooting boots will ensure Forest go three consecutive top-flight games without a goal for the first time since 1999. It will be a tough task against a buoyant Chelsea team, who entered the international break having beaten Liverpool. Moisés Caicedo was instrumental in the win against the defending champions, scoring the opener, and the 23-year-old leads the league in tackles (28) and interceptions (18). Elliot Anderson, whose total of 55 turnovers is also a league-high tally, will have his work cut out for him in what may be his toughest midfield battle of the season.Yara El-ShabouryNottingham Forest vChelsea, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)2Brighton face fight to make Europe againTony Bloom knows that standing still is not an option in thePremier League. The Brighton owner has established his boyhood club as top-flight regulars since their promotion in 2017 thanks to a shrewd recruitment process that is the envy of most of their contemporaries. Bloom acknowledged this week that his aim of qualifying for Europe again has become much harder as Fabian Hürzeler’s side prepare to face Newcastle, who have an identical record after seven matches, at the Amex on Saturday. “Everything about the Premier League every year becomes more difficult,” said Bloom. “Hence we have to always look to improve and innovate because if you stand still, our competitors are fiercely competitive. They are looking to overtake one another and get stronger all the time. We have to do likewise and ideally we are going ahead even faster than the other teams.”Ed AaronsBrighton v Newcastle, Saturday 3pm3Burnley need to shore up fortificationsThis match between two promoted sides could be a defining early-season moment, with Burnley eager to fortify Turf Moor in their push for survival. Scott Parker’s side have shown flashes of quality and their unique home needs to be a solid foundation. So far, they have taken four points from three games at Turf Moor – including a crucial win against Sunderland – while conceding just two goals. In contrast, four of their five defeats and 80% of the goals they have shipped have come on the road. Meanwhile, Leeds have generated significant optimism under Daniel Farke, securing eight points from seven games. Their promising start could have been even better had it not been for small margins. Gabriel Gudmundsson’s own goal at Fulham and the poor defending that allowedBournemoutha stoppage-time equaliser left crucial points on the table. The trip to Burnley, where they will be hoping for consecutive Premier League away wins for the first time since 2022, is another high-stakes test.YE-SBurnley v Leeds, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenScott Parker (left) and Kyle Walker will be looking for a potentially crucial win against Leeds.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/Reuters4Glasner takes plaudits despite Everton lossCrystal Palace may havelost their unbeaten record to their bogey side Evertonbut Oliver Glasner kept on winning during the international break. As well as picking up the Premier League’s manager of the month award for September – the first Palace manager to win it since Tony Pulis in 2014 – he was named Austria’s coach of the year title at the 2025 Niki awards in Vienna before attending a special Westminster reception at the Speaker’s House on Wednesday evening that celebrated their FA Cup and Community Shield triumphs, as well as the work of the Palace for Life Foundation. It’s back to business against Bournemouth on Saturday and Glasner will be hoping that the defender Chris Richards, one of six members of Palace’s squad to have played every minute of the league campaign, will have recovered after featuring in the USA’s friendly win over Australia in Colorado on Wednesday.EACrystal Palace v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm5Fragile Rodri remains vital to CityThirteen months after suffering a near-season ending knee injury against Arsenal, Rodri’s medical problems remain a concern for the player and Pep Guardiola. The midfielder is vital to Manchester City’s cause. After coming off 22 minutes intothe 1-0 win at Brentfordwith a sore hamstring (and withdrawing from Spain’s international commitments in the break), will the 29-year-old be available for Everton’s visit? If he is, it may be unrealistic to expect him to complete the 90 minutes, something the Spaniard has done just twice this season. Questions remain over Rodri’s robustness in the long term.Jamie JacksonQuick GuidePickford aiming to 'build legacy' after extending Everton stayShowThe Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford intends to \"build a legacy\" after signing a new contract at the club.The England No 1 will take his stay to 12 years after extending his existing deal to 2029. \"I'm delighted to get it done – it's an extra two years, so four years in total,\" he said. \"It just shows the commitment I've made to Everton and also the faith the club has put into me as well.\"I'm over the moon and it gives me the opportunity to build a legacy for myself here, move forward and build this club to where we want to be.

Shad Forsythe eventually left his role as head of first-team performance at the Emirates to perform the same job for Borussia Dortmund and it was regarded as quite a coup whenSunderlandsecured the American’s services late this summer. As their French striker Wilson Isidor told L’Équipe: “The intensity in training is crazy now, we’re doing a lot more physical work.” Le Bris’s team have certainly made a robust start to the season, collecting 11 points from seven games, but they could still do with a home win against a Wolves side who are bottom, especially with tricky-looking fixtures at Chelsea and at home to Everton and Arsenal on the horizon.Louise Taylorskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are in pole position after Liverpool’s wobble but must be ruthless with their advantage. A trip to Fulham on Saturday evening will test them;a draw in this fixture last seasonwas the kind of result that left Mikel Arteta’s side unable to keep up with Liverpool. Champions have to be single-minded in these games. There will be some weary limbs after the international break. Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka have played twice for England, Martin Ødegaardis out for six weekswith a knee injury and Arteta has to think about hosting Atlético Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday. But there can be no excuses. Arsenal could be four points clear of Liverpool once the weekend is over.Jacob SteinbergFulham vArsenal, Saturday 5.30pm8Draw unlikely for injury-hit Spurs and VillaExpect goals atTottenham HotspurStadium on Sunday. None of the last 20 league meetings between Spurs and Aston Villa have ended level, a streak that stretches back to a 1-1 draw in 2012. Back in the present, Spurs sit third in the league after a seven-match unbeaten streak in all competitions but, yet again, Thomas Frank must contend with an extensive injury list. Yves Bissouma is the latest addition, having sustained an ankle injury on international duty with Mali. Aston Villa have historically troubled Spurs, winning four of their last six league meetings. Unai Emery’s men will rely on their threat from dead balls – 25% of their shots having come from corners – and the playmaking prowess of Morgan Rogers. The midfielder’s nine assists in 2025 lead the league and his consistency has seen him join an exclusive list: the former captains Gareth Barry and Gareth Southgate are the only other Villa players to feature in 10 or more consecutive England matches. It is a remarkable feat for Villa and a clear sign of their resurgence at the top level despite their wobbly start to the season.YE-STottenham vAston Villa, Sunday 2pm9United putting the onus on LiverpoolArne Slot may be more preoccupied with Ruben Amorim’s approach than Liverpool’s much-debated system as the Dutchman plots a way out of a rare losing streak. Manchester United’s2-2 draw at Anfield in January, another false dawn as it turned out, was built on an improved and impressive mentality,according to Amorim. Slot was less complimentary, claiming a combination of United’s low block and long-ball tactics were responsible for frustrating Liverpool that day. “In the last 15 minutes you could see, if they play over the ground, how good they are,” was one of his many barbed comments. United played 61 long passes in the corresponding fixture last season, 15.9% of their overall total of 383, while Liverpool played 47, 10.7% of their 438 total. Slot has raised the subject of United’s tactics several times since, usually when conceding the champions still have a problem against low blocks and long-ball teams. The admission invites Amorim to play the same way. The onus is on Liverpool to find the solutions their summer recruitment policy was designed for.Andy HunterLiverpool vManchester United, Sunday 4.30pm10Hammers’ lack of forward thinkingWest Ham’s striker shortage is back in the spotlight. Niclas Füllkrug has succumbed to injury again, leaving Callum Wilson as Nuno Espírito Santo’s only specialist option up front. It is not the best planning. Wilson, 33, has made one start since signing on a free transfer, and has been an unused substitute since Nuno was hired in place of Graham Potter last month. Alternatives, though, are thin on the ground. Nuno could be forced to ask Jarrod Bowen to shift into the middle againstBrentford, but the captain is far more effective on the right. Who else, though? Lucas Paquetá is an uncomfortable fit as a false 9. Callum Marshall made his Premier League debut by coming on for Füllkrug against Arsenal this month. There could be an opening for the 20-year-old Northern Ireland international.JSWest Hamv Brentford, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal711162Liverpool74153Tottenham Hotspur78144AFC Bournemouth73145Man City79136Crystal Palace74127Chelsea74118Everton72119Sunderland711110Man Utd7-21011Newcastle71912Brighton70913Aston Villa7-1914Fulham7-3815Leeds7-4816Brentford7-3717Nottm Forest7-7518Burnley7-8419West Ham7-10420Wolverhampton7-92Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendNottingham ForestChelseaBrighton & Hove AlbionNewcastle UnitedBurnleyLeeds UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets.“The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.”The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the decision was a “national disgrace” and urged Starmer to reverse it.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Villa saidthe local safety advisory group had instructed the club that “no away fans will be permitted”.“The club are in continuous ­dialogue with Maccabi Tel Aviv and the local authorities throughout this ongoing process, with the safety of supporters attending the match and the safety of local residents at the forefront of any decision,” Villa said.There was significant unrest when Maccabi played Ajax on 7 ­November. A report by Dutch police into the ­disorder, which lasted two days, found that Maccabi fans had torn a Palestinian flag down from the facade of a local building and burned it, shouted “Fuck you, Palestine”and vandalised a taxi, among a series of incidents before the fixture. After the match, what were described by Amsterdam’s mayor as a series of “hit-and-run” assaults on Maccabi fans, led to five people being taken to hospital and a further 20 to 30 being slightly injured. Sixty-two people were arrested, mainly for ­public order offences.The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, posted on X: “Shameful decision! I call on the UK ­authorities to reverse this coward decision!” The Palestine Solidarity Campaign said the match should be cancelled, writing on X: “Israeli football teams shouldn’t play in international tournaments whilst it commits genocide and apartheid.”The Independent MP forBirmingham Perry Barr, Ayoub Khan, said: “I welcome the Safety Advisory Group’s decision. With so much hostility and ­uncertainty around the match, it was only right to take drastic measures.”Ajax were prevented last month from having fans at a Champions League match in Marseille after the French interior ministry banned “anyone claiming to be an Ajax Amsterdam supporter” from ­travelling between the French border and the southern city. Ajax said they had been informed the decision had been taken “on grounds of public safety and security”.The same week, the prefecture of Naples prevented the selling of tickets to Eintracht Frankfurt fans hoping to travel to their Champions League match against Napoli.Uefa said: “In all cases, the competent local authorities remain responsible for decisions related to the safety and security of matches taking place on their territory, such decisions being determined on the basis of thorough risk assessments, which vary from match to match and take into consideration previous circumstances.”Explore more on these topicsMaccabi Tel AvivAston VillaEuropa LeagueBirminghamnewsShareReuse this content"

It was not pretty in the Estádio da Luz, but it was enough, just, with Arsenal’s lack of cutting edge remaining a major concern.“Really happy because we have won. It’s not easy to come here after losing the first game, so it was really important for us. At the same time, we need to be better,” Caldentey told Disney+. Asked what they need to be better at she said: “Almost everything. We need to be more consistent ­defensively and we have so much quality up front that we should score more goals.“It’s not one or two players, it’s all of us. Football is about momentum and sometimes it’s hard to change that dynamic.”The return to the city of theirheroic underdog triumph over Barcelonain the Champions League final in May, this time in Benfica’s home instead of Sporting CP’s José Alvalade Stadium, was shrouded in far less optimism this time round.Benfica v Arsenal: Women’s Champions League – liveRead moreThen, Arsenal fans had travelled with hopes tempered, given the scale of the task, but spirits high, after a stellar run to their second final. This time, the side that arrived in Lisbon was a more beleaguered one after a disappointing start to a season full of promise.The Gunners have dropped seven points in their opening six WSL games and went four games without a win, includinga 2-1 loss in their ­Champions League openeragainst Lyonnes, before Sunday’s less than convincing1-0 win over Brightonhalted that frustrating run.There were several changes to the team that earned the win on Sunday, including Lotte Wubben-Moy coming in for the 19-year-old centre-back Katie Reid, who has a groin injury.In the first half, the story was a familiar one, Arsenal dominated possession, accruing almost 70%, but failed to make that count, a cutting edge in the final third mysteriously missing with Benfica matching them with five shots and bettering them two on target to Arsenal’s none.It would take a bit of chaos in Benfica’s area to give Arsenal the lead after the break, Caldentey’s cross towards Mead in the middle pinballed off Beatriz Cameirão before Diana Gomes and Mead got touches in with the latter doing enough to send it rolling slowly over the line.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was the night injury-time goals from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær sealedUnited’s 2-1 comebackin the Champions League final against Bayern Munich at the Camp Nou. It was also the night the life of one United fan in Bulgaria, who has died this week at the age of 62, changed for ever.That supporter was born Marin Zdravkov Levidzhov in Svishtov, a town on the Danube with a population of 22,000. Growing up in communist Bulgaria adoring football, he dreamed of changing his name to …Manchester United. To claim the name of a football club from the capitalist west, however, was mission impossible. Had Marin tried to do so before the fall of the regime, he would almost certainly have ended up in jail.Ten years after the end of communism in Bulgaria – on that night in May 1999 – Marin’s idiosyncratic dream edged closer to reality. Watching the final from his modest home in Svishtov and with United trailing, Marin made a promise to himself: if United somehow turned the game around, he would do anything to change his name to that of the club he loved. Then the impossible happened.View image in fullscreenMarin fulfils his dream of visiting Old Trafford.Photograph: Family handoutThe next day, Marin visited a lawyer expressing his unusual request and so began a long, hard battle. Marin’s father, from whom he had inherited his love of United, was long gone and the 36-year-old was living with his mother, working all kinds of odd jobs, including as a construction worker on £15 a day. He was hardly making ends meet, yet his dream became an obsession. He quickly turned into the talk of the town, then became an international sensation, but 15 years full of legal battles and disheartening court decisions lay ahead.Marin’s wish was rejected initially for copyright reasons: he could not change his name to a trademark known around the globe. Then a local judge ruled partially in his favour, saying Marin could change his first name to Manchester but that he was not to use United as his official surname. “But I don’t want to be named after a city in England, I want to wear the name of my favourite football club,” Marin told the court. The struggle continued.When not in court, he was often looking after his cats. He had plenty of them in his back yard in Svishtov and loved them as much as the Red Devils. He named them all after United players: from Rio to Rooney, they were the most famous cats in town. Which was the favourite cat of Man U (as his close friends called him)? A kitty called Beckham.View image in fullscreenMarin bedecked in United gear.Photograph: Family handoutMarin managed another breakthrough in court: he was allowed to add United as an official nickname to his ID card. But still he wasn’t happy. “I won’t stop until my full name is Manchester United,” he vowed. His story soon led to commercial propositions – an offer to have fan merchandise produced under his new name – but despite his financial struggles, he rejected the opportunity because he did not want to profit from his favourite club. The Manchester United name was sacred to him.A documentary followed in 2011. The crew turned Marin’s dream of visiting Old Trafford into reality and there he even met Dimitar Berbatov, the Bulgaria striker playing for United at the time.Marin tattooed the United crest on his forehead three years later as a protest against the court decisions and in his last few years it became more and more difficult for him to continue his legal battle. Job opportunities were scarce and he lost his mother to Covid-19. But somehow, he found a way. Born as a Catholic, he got baptised in an orthodox church under the name Manchester United Zdravkov Levidzhov. “At least God will know me with my real name,” he used to say.This Monday, 13 October, his heart stopped beating. Perhaps now Manchester United’s restless soul could finally find peace.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe they found the right man after allByWhoScoredHarry PatersonThu 16 Oct 2025 11.56 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 18.50 EDTShareWhen Alexander Isak sealed his£125m British record transfer to Liverpool, Newcastle fans braced themselves for a period of turbulence. Losing their striker, who scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances, felt a decisive blow – until a 6ft 6in German began to win them over.Replacing a centre-forward is not as simple as matching goals with goals. Newcastle’s task was to replace a player ​around who​m the team’s attacking identity had been built. The answer was the 23-year-old Nick Woltemade, a young, promising forward from VFB Stuttgart, but untested at the very top level.Premier League clubs turn to hidden gambling partners to beat sponsorship banRead moreNewcastle were linked with a number of strikers in the summer. Benjamin Sesko’s explosive speed and ability to exploit high defensive lines seemed a natural replacement for Isak, but he hadhis heart set on Manchester United. Hugo Ekitike offered silky dribbling and flair akin to Isak’s technical ability, buthe chose the champions, Liverpool. Viktor Gyökeres could not stop scoring for Sporting andhe ended up at Arsenal.Woltemade seemed to be a compromise,a punt on potentialrather than a direct heir to Isak.The club-record £69m price taglooked hefty, particularly for a player who had been playing for SV Elversberg in Germany’s third tier two years earlier. Alan Shearer was unsure, warning in early September: “He’s probably had maybe seven or eight months of good football … it’s a big, big ask for him to go in and lead the line as Newcastle’s No 9.”His goal-per-game rate – 0.2 in the Bundesliga – hardly compared with Isak’s rate of 0.63 per game in thePremier Leagueand Woltemade’s style made him a curious choice. Whereas Isak thrives as a technical, poaching No 9, Woltemade’s game revolves around link-up play, dropping deep and facilitating others. For a club that had spent the past three seasons building its shape around a different style of attacker, this was a tactical gamble as much as a financial one.But what appeared to be a compromise is showing early signs of being the right solution. It took the towering forward 29 minutes of his debut to win over the sceptical fans at St James’ Parkby rising above Emmanuel Agbadou after some smart movement tohead home the winner against Wolves.He backed up that effort with three more goals, taking his tally to four in six Premier League and Champions League appearances. Just like that, the Isak hangover was gone, the noise of a summer of turmoil was drowned out by the chants from the Toon Army.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade scored his first goal and the winner for Germany this week against Northern Ireland.Photograph: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesThough his goals have been a welcome addition to a side that has started the season with the fifth-fewest goals in the Premier League (six), Woltemade’s real impact lies in how he is transforming Newcastle’s approach. He offers a new dimension to their traditionally direct style, blending the physical presence of the traditional No 9 with the technical qualities of a deep-lying playmaker.Unlike Isak, who thrived on stretching defences and getting in behind the last line of defence, Woltemade prefers to play between the lines, dropping into midfield zones to link play and help his team progress play. He gives his side another route out of a high press rather than a long ball and drags defenders out of position in tight areas. This, in turn, gives Newcastle greater positional fluidity as Anthony Gordon, Anthony Elanga and Jacob Murphy now push higher and narrower from the wing, using Woltemade’s movement to find gaps behind defenders.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But where there was once an emphasis on pace and movement behind the last line of defence to exploit Isak’s finishing ability there is now more controlled possession, using Woltemade’s link-up play to build attacks rather than relying solely on transitions.Despite the promise Woltemade brings, there are some teething problems to overcome. The data suggests growing pains of integrating their new focal point; Newcastle sit third from bottom in the Premier League for xG difference at -3.27, they have taken the ninth-fewest shots and are averaging 0.86 goals per game.The front line is still finding its rhythm. Woltemade’s movement patterns are not yet fully understood by his teammates and the fluid attacking triangles that once thrived between Lewis Hall, Joelinton and Gordon have been disrupted as roles have shifted. The team is still learning how to make the most of his hold-up play and his ability to link midfield to attack, with a tendency to be overly direct at times.Replacing Isak was never going to be simple and Eddie Howe is still ironing out some kinks, but Woltemade’s influence is already clear. He has big boots to fill, but he is proving that the club’s future does not just lie in just replacing Isak, it lies in evolving into a team capable of surprising opponents in new ways. Woltemade is more than capable of that.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedGuardian Sport NetworkPremier LeagueTransfer windowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I felt very strongly aboutthe supreme court ruling, politically and emotionally. It really hurt me, even though I’m a cisgender woman, and it still hurts me because it targets people within my community.I really feel part of the queer community because I grew up in a pretty small town in the Netherlands and didn’t have a lot of queer people in my circle or in school, and there wasn’t a lot of representation on TV. I never really felt a part of any community because I didn’t really know it was out there. Growing up and coming out and being in women’s football, which has a very accepting and open environment, and then moving to Manchester, I felt that I could be myself and I became much more in touch with the community. It has been a new, refreshing part of my life.‘People are welcoming’ – Goal Diggers FC hold inclusive tournament as FA ban on trans women startsRead moreAfter the supreme court ruling I wanted to spread solidarity, give them love and appreciation and cut through all the hate they were getting. The ruling made me put those colours on my wrist, but my feelings and thoughts had built up over the years to the point where I wanted to do something.The response was overwhelmingly positive. I got so many incredible responses from within the trans community – from trans fans from all clubs across the WSL, from trans people who love sports – but also from people across the world. I loved the allyship from other queer groups or straight cis people, supporting them and showing them love. I didn’t want to tell people what to do, because I don’t think that works, but I wanted to share my solidarity and I hoped it would connect people. It was very wholesome and if anyone was spreading hate in my mentions online I didn’t have to respond because people understood and would jump on it.That action on the pitch, and the response and impact it had, made me realise my voice is a lot louder than I thought. I underestimated how vital our support is for those who need a voice. I decided I wanted to help more, to give back to my community, and that I especially wanted to help women. It is trans women who are affected by the supreme court’s decision but it is an attack on women as a whole.So I started to look for ways to help and got in contact with the LGBT Foundation, which is based in Manchester. That’s how I became a patron for the foundation and I’m really happy to be able to champion its work.I became a patron of the organisation in September and on 3 October I announced on my Instagram the launch of a women’s programme calledLevelling the Playing Fieldwhich I’m helping to fundraise for.The foundation helps hundreds of women get vital care, gives them a safe space and runs workshops around sexual health, domestic violence, sobriety and more.View image in fullscreenKerstin Casparij: ‘I’ve been raised to greet people, whoever they are, wherever they come from, with kindness and an open heart.’Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesIn sport, especially in women’s football, we are good at inclusion and that is something we’ve prided ourselves on. I’ve been raised to greet people, whoever they are, wherever they come from, with kindness and an open heart. If I disagree with anyone, I’ve been taught to connect with them rather than push them away. We need more empathy in every area of society.That is really hard in today’s society but we have to do it. We need to ask questions such as: how can we connect? How can we make sure everybody feels included? How can everyone reap the many benefits from being involved in sport? In women’s football that is something we are really passionate about. No matter who comes to our games, how can we make sure everybody feels included and has a safe space?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Initially, they were quite worried, saying: “Oh, should you do that? Obviously, we love you and are very proud of you, but we don’t want you to get any abuse, any hate.”The hate is something that I’ve learned to filter, because I’ve accepted unfortunately it is going to happen. My partner, Ruth, and I had a video go viral recently and the comment section was just awful, but I’ve become a bit desensitised to it because those people aren’t important to me. That doesn’t make it acceptable for people to sit behind a keyboard and behave this way, and if social media platforms did more to tackle it, that would be a step in the right direction. But they can have their opinion and I don’t really care. I’m not trying to convince people; I’m trying to help people that need it.In my job, I’m used to abusive comments and messages, getting grief here and there, whereas for my partner it’s quite new so I worry more about how she is dealing with it.The audience for women’s football has grown significantly and there is a broader audience coming. That is great but it means the environment we’ve built for many years is changing a little bit. As players, we are very keen on keeping our values. We’ve put out statements against racism after games, for example, and it’s important to keep pushing and make clear that women’s football and football in general should not be a place for discrimination or hate. We are proud to be an environment that has grown a beautiful fan base because we are a welcoming sport.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free weekly email, Moving the Goalposts.

Around the walls, painted black up to halfway, are motivational slogans that have become common currency in training environments. “Go hard or go home,” one of them urges. “Hard work beats talent, when talent chooses not to work hard,” cautions another.Beneath the second of those messages, Gerard Deulofeu stands in conversation with Angel Aceña, Udinese’s rehab fitness coach. They are a team now, working towards a goal that never quite stands still. It is 8.30am and, as always, Deulofeu has been here for half an hour. There has been a session on one set of weights and shortly he will cross the room for another, checking a monitor for the latest notes of optimism. There is not another footballer in sight.Premier League clubs turn to hidden gambling partners to beat sponsorship banRead moreJust after 10.15am Deulofeu emerges from the dressing room area and sits down gingerly beside the Bluenergy Stadium pitch. There is a plaster on his right leg slightly above the knee; he has just undergone his monthly injection and nearly 33 months after he last played a game the consequences are nothing new. “For the first 24 hours it’s … urgh,” he says, wincing. At close quarters, the difference between the visible mass of his legs is pronounced.Deulofeu wants to create a miracle: for himself and for every player who, like him, is forced to handle the isolation and stifling uncertainty wreaked by devastating injury. “I know I’m trying something special,” says the 31-year-old. “Maybe it’s the most difficult recovery in history. If I manage to come back it’ll be more than 1,000 days. But I’m a guy who takes care of himself and I think I can do it. If there’s one guy to do it, it’s me.”View image in fullscreenGerard Deulofeu’s problems stem from an ACL injury and the picture worsened when surgery led to an infection.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianHe can remember everything about his 12 minutes on the pitch in Genoa, against Sampdoria, on 22 January 2023. Two months previously, he had torn an anterior cruciate ligament in a game against Napoli, close to tears as he departed, but appeared to have healed sufficiently while domestic football paused for the winter World Cup.“It was bad, but not too much,” he says. Coming on as a substitute in the 77th minute should have lifted a cloud. “But in every action I tried, a one-two or something like that, the knee just went. I had to ask to be taken off. The ACL was completely broken.”So far, that makes for a familiar story of ill fortune and occupational hazard. Many footballers return to long careers after ACL surgery; others are not so lucky. But Deulofeu went under the knife in Rome and, in the process, sustained an infection that darkened the picture immeasurably. It ravaged his cartilage and reduced his knee movements to bone against bone; the prospects for his long-term mobility looked bleak enough without football entering the picture.“It’s not like a usual injury,” he says. “As an old person it can happen that your knee is completely destroyed and now it happened to me because the infection was getting worse and worse.“I knew from those early months that I couldn’t be back quickly. In every MRI I had, the cartilage had deteriorated. I lost my muscle, my knee wouldn’t flex properly, there was a lot to recover and it was very slow.”Cell treatment, where cells are transplanted from a piece of healthy cartilage into the damaged area, was the only remaining glimmer of hope for his career. Deulofeu travelled back to Barcelona, where it all began when he joined La Masia in 2003, for the operation and was warned by the doctor that things might not work out. “I said: ‘No problem.’ I had only one chance.”That was nine months into his recovery, towards the end of 2023. The following June he felt well enough to start running, first on a treadmill then on the training pitch, but it was too much, too soon. He has not run since; he believes the cartilage is 90% healed, but wants to build more strength in the knee to reduce the chances of further setbacks. “I need to be able to train every day, not one day on and the next day off,” he says.Those early mornings, the solo workouts with Aceña and other medical staff, have to sustain him. So does the idea that he will turn out again in Italy’s top flight for Udinese, who terminated his contract in January, but have agreed to support his recovery and are keeping the door open for a return.“They’re waiting for me,” he says. “Giving me the time and passion to recover. I really appreciate that they have helped me and given me this opportunity to stay here, working in this amazing stadium.”He feels settled here in Friuli with his wife and three children; it was the perfect landing spot when, in October 2020, he trod the well-beaten path from Watford. There had never been doubts about Deulofeu’s ability: at his best he was an explosive runner, a clever creative force and inventive finisher. Everton, Sevilla and Milan were lured by a talent who produced staggering numbers for Barcelona B and Spain’s age-group teams. To some extent he delivered for them all, but it was in Udine, where he scored 13Serie Agoals in his last full season, that things really clicked.View image in fullscreenGerard Deulofeu celebrates with Lionel Messi after scoring for Barcelona in 2017. ‘Now that I’ve had to pause, I can see how big my career was and is,’ he says.Photograph: fotopress/Getty Images“Now that I’ve had to pause, I can see how big my career was and is,” he says. “I’m really proud. I came from Barcelona: people can see that and maybe say you could have been more successful, but you have to appreciate I already played for Barça, Milan, won the Europa League with Sevilla, played in the Champions League, played for the national team and scored, reached the FA Cup final with Watford. OK, of course it can be better, but that’s just ‘maybe, maybe’. What can I demand more from my career than all this?”It provokes the question: why try to continue? Why rise at the crack of dawn five days a week, the first step bringing pain every time, before working on a separate schedule to his peers with no resolution in sight? He has made his money, after all, and home life is ceaselessly rewarding. “Sometimes I’m thinking that,” he says. “Thoughts pop up that say: ‘Oh Gerard, finish, just finish because you already made a good career and have a family.’ But if I say to my wife that it’s too difficult and I don’t think I’ll be back, she says: ‘Let’s try, you’re going to do it.’“That’s my strength: those positive messages from my wife, and the fact my kids want to see me playing. So I’m trying, but there are days when the thoughts are bad.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The previous day, Udinese drew with Cagliari here and could certainly have done with Deulofeu’s wit in the final third. He limits his attendance at games: overexertion at the weekend would be unwise and, for one thing, climbing too many stairs remains a hindrance. “But I came here with my son a couple of weeks ago,” he says. “He was really young when I last played. We watched the match and he was just asking me: ‘When? When are you back?’ I’m trying, I’m trying.”View image in fullscreenGerard Deulofeu scores the goal against Wolves that took Watford to the FA Cup final in 2019.Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images/ReutersUdinese encourage him to mix with the first-team squad, much changed since he last played, and help those settling into the area. There are dinners and the occasional drink; sometimes he will watch training. But recovery, buying himself whatever time he can through every moment of rest, comes first. Usually, he will return home after four or five hours at the stadium and read books while using an oxygen machine. Then there is the benefit of moments usually taken away from elite sportspeople.“I can see my kids growing, it’s the most important thing,” he says. “You don’t see that when you’re travelling and playing every three days. That’s the good part of this.”Next Generation 2025: 60 of the best young talents in world footballRead moreDeulofeu says more than once he does not feel lonely; that this endless furrow is not significantly damaging his mental health. There is a sense he needs the routine after the bulk of a lifetime spent bound to training regimes. He cites his friend Santi Cazorla, who is playing for Real Oviedo at 40 despite almost two years out with an injury of similar gravity, as a constant source of support, but discipline comes naturally now.“I’ve learned that I’m the one who knows my body,” he says. “I feel comfortable taking care of this situation. I have my family and an emotional state I know is good. I know my habits and organisation in life are sound.“I have people sending me the right messages, and I’m happy. I’m a guy who loves waking up in the morning with good energy.“I couldn’t have done this 10 years ago. You need experience and to have the emotional part of your life under control. I’d have had to stop.”He understands that may still be the outcome, but also feels he has come too far not to see this through. “I’m preparing to get out on the training pitch again in a few months, and let’s see if I feel good out there. If I don’t, then maybe I have to take a decision. But I’m only 31 and I just want to try. I have time, the club is giving me time, so I don’t want to put a date on it.“I know that one day, if I’m playing out here again, this stadium is going to be completely full. I know how it’s going to be that day for this city and this club. It’s going to be a party.“They know how much I love this club and how I played when I was available. We want to make history together.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballUdineseSerie AinterviewsShareReuse this content"

And while two of those were in 50-over games, his overall returns stand at 556 runs at 111.2.Labuschagne played with ease and control all around the wicket on Thursday, hitting 18 boundaries and one big six off Lloyd Pope in the first two sessions.A week after Australia coach, Andrew McDonald, declared the 31-year-old was back near his best, Labuschagne certainly looked it in Adelaide.He drove the quicks down the ground and through the covers with confidence, and was back hitting spinners to the mid-on and mid-wicket boundaries.There is little doubt this was the Labuschagne whose meteoric rise saw him become the world’s No 1-ranked Test batter for large periods between late 2021 and early 2023.The right-hander got off the mark with a thick outside edge from Nathan McAndrew after having dust caught in his eye before he took strike.And while another ball dropped marginally in front of second slip when he was on 31, that was still played with soft hands in an innings where false shots were incredibly rare.View image in fullscreenSam Konstas is yet to make an impact for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield.Photograph: Graham Denholm/Getty ImagesLabuschagne brought up his century when he clipped Liam Scott to the boundary on the 129th ball he faced, earning congratulations from Test keeper Alex Carey.Carey eventually had Labuschagne caught behind late in the day, playing at a ball outside off-stump from Wes Agar (3-48).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The only question for selectors will be where to bat him.Labuschagne’s preferred position is No 3, where he is batting for Queensland and has spent most of his Test career.The likes of David Warner and Matthew Hayden have urged against moving Labuschagne to open, but Australia’s options to partner Usman Khawaja are limited.Sam Konstas is yet to fire a shot for NSW, while Marcus Harris and Cameron Bancroft are also yet to impress.Jake Weatherald did hit 94 for Tasmania against Western Australia on Thursday, with the left-hander the only other opener in real form.If Labuschagne was to open, it would allow Cameron Green to stay at No 3 and Beau Webster to remain in the side at No 6 if he overcomes an ankle injury.Putting Labuschagne back in at No 3 would likely force a squeeze on Webster, who hopes to be fit to return for Tasmania for the next Shield round this month.Khawaja hit a solid 46 for the Bulls on Thursday before he was caught behind off, while youngster Lachlan Hearne was unbeaten on 66 at the close.Explore more on these topicsAustralia cricket teamAshes 2025 - 26The AshesAustralia sportCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

They went on to record the third-highest partnership by any Australian pair at a Women’s World Cup.Earlier, during the sluggish fielding effort, Healy spilled the simplest of edges off Darcie Brown and also failed to grasp a difficult lofted one off Annabel Sutherland. Frustratingly, she also did take a clean catch off Brown but didn’t have it reviewed when the umpire rejected their appeal.The recalled Brown sent down the fastest deliveries at the World Cup so far but was still the Aussies’ most expensive bowler, going for 0-52 off her nine overs.Instead, the spinners thrived, led by King, whose spell could have been even productive if Beth Mooney hadn’t dropped one in the slips.Fellow spinners Georgia Wareham (2-22 off seven) and Ash Gardner (2-48 off nine) both chipped in, while Sutherland consolidated her position as the tournament’s leading wicket-taker with her 2-41, taking her tally to 13.Rubya Haider’s 44 and Mostary’s unbeaten 66 off 80 balls took Bangladesh to their record total against the Aussies, but the total was made to look easy meat by a side who had chased down 330 against India four days earlier.“It’s always nice when you’ve got the ‘Q’ next to your name in a World Cup,” said player-of-the-match King. “No doubt it doesn’t stop here.

The last remaining candidate is due to pull out on Friday because of an arcane election rule.Tim Mayer, a former FIA senior steward with 15 years in the role until he wassacked last November, was one of three candidates who had announced they would oppose Ben Sulayem, alongside the former racing driver Laura Villars and the Belgian journalist Virginie Philippot.George Russell stays at Mercedes next season but door not shut on pursuit of VerstappenRead moreNone of them, however, are able to meet the FIA requirements for the election process. Mayer is expected to formally announce the end of his campaign in Austin on Friday , the Guardian understands, where he will make clear the reasons behind it and his assessment of the current electoral process.The regulation in question requires any presidential candidate to submit six prospective vice-presidents, one from each of the FIA’s global regions.Extraordinarily, the person who has unwittingly found themselves at the heart of the issue is the Brazilian wife of the former F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, Fabiana Ecclestone, who is the only world council representative for South America and has already declared for Ben Sulayem.With no other representatives from South America, candidates cannot name a potential vice-president for the region and are thus ­ineligible to stand, leaving Ben Sulayem ­unopposed in December’s election.It is believed Mayer will nonetheless continue to campaign in order to demonstrate that he would have been a credible alternative.The governing body said: “The FIA presidential election is a structured and democratic process, to ensure fairness and integrity at every stage. Prospective candidates have had since the publication of the detailed information on 13 June to prepare their applications.”Recently Ben Sulayem has come under ­increased criticism surrounding the governance of the FIA, including ­accusations of a concentration of power in his hands and that of the senate and in limiting the efficacy of the ­ethics committee that would allow enquiries to be suppressed by the president.David Richards, the chair of Motorsport UK, noted he had “concerns about the erosion of accountability and good governance within the FIA”. While the former deputy president for sport Robert Reid, who resigned in April, cited his unhappiness with “critical decisions being made without due process” and a “fundamental breakdown in governance standards”.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

England struggled to chase a score against Bangladesh, South Africa struggled to chase a score against Bangladesh, and now the Aussies have come out and done inside 25 overs without losing a wicket. And that means their semi-final spot is locked up.It was a really poor performance by Bangladesh in the field, though. So many runs given away, dropped catches, missed stumpings. A shame, because while you wouldn’t call their batting performance dominant, it had a plan and some sense, and it gave them something to bowl at in the manner of their performances against England and South Africa.Rubya Haider got them off to a good start with her well paced 44, with Sharmin Akhter Supta riding shotgun. There was a very slow period through the middle when Alana King and then Georgia Wareham kept prising out wickets while giving away very few runs, but Sobhana Mostary was terrific, continuing to score with the tail, and ending up on 66 not out with the support of the No11 Trisna. It was the first ever Bangladesh 50 against Australia in this format.A score of 198 at least gave Bangladesh a chance, and it was their highest score against Australia. But they weren’t expecting to be chastened in the way that Healy did it today. That’s a shame for a team that continues to be competitive in parts of matches, but against the top side that was still a long way off.Share"

Ali Riley, now 37, captain of New Zealand and a veteran of five World Cup campaigns, looks back on witnessing that moment in person and says: “That made me want to be a strong woman that could show her abs in front of the entire world and be on the front page of a newspaper. I think about how uncool it was to be good at sports, back then, and that moment was pivotal for me to see those women do what they did and be celebrated for it.”On Sunday it will be Riley being celebrated at what is being billed as her farewell match at her home-town club Angel City, who named her as their first captain in 2022. She is retiring at the end of this season after a remarkable career that has included 163 international caps, four Olympic Games and spells with Rosengård, Bayern Munich and Chelsea, and Sunday is poised to be Angel City’s final home game of a season in which the playoffs appear to be beyond them. Her decision to retire comes after a year in which she has been through IVF, seen her childhoodLos Angeles home burn downand got married, all while attempting to rehabilitate from a chronic nerve injury, so being able to hang up her boots on her own terms, back in Angel City’s squad, may be her biggest achievement.View image in fullscreenBrandi Chastain’s celebration after winning the 1999 World Cup inspired Ali Riley.Photograph: Robert Beck/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images“I went into a 50-50, landed awkwardly, and I just felt burning down my whole left leg,” Riley says, of the initial injury to a muscle in her glutes, the obturator internus, in 2023, the complications from which led to her nerve injury. “I had never felt anything like that before, and for months I couldn’t walk. You get like these lightning strikes burning your leg. I called them ‘zingers’.“I had medical professionals saying to me: ‘It’s in your head, so if you meditate, you won’t feel it.’ That’s not correct, that did not help me. We were trying medication, injections, but the pain, it takes your breath away, like someone stabbing you. I went in the gym every day for seven months and saw no progress. And then we found a doctor in Salt Lake city who – I thank him – tried a different injection and eventually I got to where I am right now. I can use my leg to play soccer. For two hours I can be on the field and feel great. The rest of the day is still pretty tough. I can perform, I can train and I get to be with my team. But physically and emotionally, I can’t do this for longer than probably another couple of games, so I can’t keep living like this. I am retiring because I have to take care of myself.”Riley returned to Angel City’s matchday squad in August, crying tears of joy with her teammates and medical staff, but has not got beyond being an unused substitute, though the hope is for her make an appearance on Sunday. She wants more knowledge for people needing treatment for nerve injuries and more discussion in soccer around motherhood and supporting aspiring parents. “I did two rounds of IVF during my injury – it’s something we should be speaking about more,” she says. “There is a very short window and an egg retrieval can be very uncomfortable [so] I really hope that we get even more support.“It’s not something that anyone spoke to me about and doing IVF at age 37, it’s a lot harder than if you freeze your eggs earlier in your career. We’re seeing more players have kids and return to play, which is so important for that visibility. Right now it’s not possible for everyone. But women can do anything if we are given the support and the resources.”View image in fullscreenAli Riley (left) playing for New Zealand against the US, where she was born, in 2023.Photograph: Hannah Peters/Getty ImagesJust after her IVF, Riley’s heart broke when her parents’ house, where she had grown up in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, burned down in January’s destructive fires.Riley appears to feel immense sadness as she recalls seeing her neighbourhood burn, but has also a strong sense of perspective, grateful to have her loved ones safe and around her, as well as her memories. “I’m so lucky to have grown up in a place like the Palisades where I was so safe and I was able to be a kid and play outside until dark – it’s where I learned how to play soccer.” She says her parents are planning to rebuild. “I really try to turn everything into a positive,” she says, “and not think so much about my own or our own suffering but wanting to give back and still spread joy.”Three days later she was getting married, and she begins to well up and she speaks of her gratitude for her husband’s contribution to her comeback from injury.“I don’t know what I would do without Lucas because there were many, many days when I was depressed and he has really picked up everything that I used to have more energy for, and brought me so much joy. He’s really been the one to help me get out of the house, do the grocery shopping and make us dinner. I had lost myself a lot and I became definitely a shell of myself and I don’t ever want that to happen again.”Those low points will not be what she remembers most, though, when she reflects on her career of nearly two decades. Her international career with New Zealand,where her father is from, gives her the greatest pride, all the tiring economy-class journeys worth it when she helped her country earntheir first World Cup victory.It came on home soil on the opening night of the 2023 World Cup, against Norway, and Riley says it was the “best day and night of my whole life” as her teammates honoured their predecessors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I remember just sitting on the field while everyone else swarmed around the ball.

Her heart has continued to lie in California. “Being part of Angel City has been the best part of my career. To come home, I think it’s what so many athletes dream of. [My mantra was:] ‘I’m going to give everything I have, every day.’”Riley has plenty of media experience – not to mention, a cookbook – and indicates that will be part of her next chapter, although also she says: “I would love to have a Foundation one day. I would love to invest in, or own, a club one day. I want to be part of this insane growth of women’s sports, especially women’s football.“It feels like culture is changing, society is changing. We’re in a different era where we can say: ‘We’ve arrived.’ Yes, we need to fight for more investment. Yes, there are still trolls and a lot of men who might not see the power and how profitable women’s sports is. But the platforms are there and it’s more accessible, so I want to cover the game, celebrate how far we’ve come and to be able to do that through the lens of media.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballAngel City FCNew Zealand women's football teamUS sportsNWSLinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The tension between the music industry and some tech firms has already led to three major labels suing AI companies whose tools create music from user prompts.“Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished,” said Spotify. “We don’t. Musicians’ rights matter. Copyright is essential. If the music industry doesn’t lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation.”The issue of copyright – a legal right that prevents others from using your work without permission – has become abattleground between the creative industries and the tech sector, which has been using publicly available, copyright-protected data to build artificial intelligence tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT andAnthropic’s Claude.The three music majors aresuing two AI music startups, Udio and Suno, for alleged copyright infringement, amid similar lawsuits in other areas of the media and creative world. Both Udio and Suno have said their technology is designed to generate new musical output and does not reproduce specific artists’ work.The head of Universal Music Group, Sir Lucian Grainge, wrote in a memo to staff this week that Universal would seek an artist’s consent before licensing use of their voice or existing songs to an AI company.One of the most notorious musical deepfakes was published in 2023. Heart on My Sleeve,a song featuring AI-made vocals purporting to be Drake and the Weeknd, was pulled from streaming services after Universal, which represented both artists, criticised the song for “infringing content created with generative AI”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Stockholm-based company said the products would create new revenue streams for artists and songwriters, ensuring they are “properly compensated for uses of their work and transparently credited for their contributions”.Spotify is also partnering with Merlin, a digital rights company for independent record labels, and Believe, a French digital music label, as part of the AI collaboration. Spotify already uses AI to create playlists and a personalised DJ.The heads of the three majors welcomed the agreement, with the chair of Sony Music Group, Rob Stringer, saying that there must “direct licensing” of artists’ work before a new product is launched.

Rahman was found not only to have used AI to prepare his work, but “failed thereafter to undertake any proper checks on the accuracy”.The upper tribunal judge Mark Blundell said Rahman had even tried to hide the fact he had used AI and “wasted” the tribunal’s time. Blundell said he was considering reporting Rahman to the Bar Standards Board. The Guardian has contacted Rahman’s firm for comment.The matter came to light in the case of two Honduran sisters who claimed asylum on the basis that they were being targeted by a criminal gang in their home country. Rahman represented the sisters, aged 29 and 35. The case escalated to the upper tribunal.Blundell rejected Rahman’s arguments, adding that “nothing said by Mr Rahman orally or in writing establishes an error of law on the part of the judge and the appeal must be dismissed”.Then, in a rare ruling, Blundell went on to say in a postscript that there were “significant problems” within the grounds of appeal put before him.He said that 12 authorities were cited in the paperwork by Rahman, but when he came to read the grounds, he noticed that “some of those authorities did not exist and that others did not support the propositions of law for which they were cited in the grounds”.In his judgment, he listed 10 of these cases and set out “what was said by Mr Rahman about those actual or fictitious cases”.Blundell said: “Mr Rahman appeared to know nothing about any of the authorities he had cited in the grounds of appeal he had supposedly settled in July this year. He had apparently not intended to take me to any of those decisions in his submissions.“Some of the decisions did not exist. Not one decision supported the proposition of law set out in the grounds.”Blundell said the submissions made by Rahman – who said he had used “various websites” to conduct his research – were therefore misleading.Blundell said: “The most obvious explanation is … that the grounds of appeal were drafted in whole or in part by generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT.“I am bound to observe that one of the cases cited in Mr Rahman’s grounds … has recently been wrongly deployed by ChatGPT in support of similar arguments.”Rahman told the judge that the inaccuracies in the grounds were “as a result of his drafting style” and he accepted there might have been some “confusion and vagueness” in his submissions.Blundell said: “The problems which I have detailed above are not matters of drafting style. The authorities which were cited in the grounds either did not exist or did not support the grounds of which were advanced.”He added: “It is overwhelmingly likely, in my judgment, that Mr Rahman used generative artificial intelligence to formulate the grounds of appeal in this case, and that he attempted to hide that fact from me during the hearing.“Even if Mr Rahman thought, for whatever reason, that these cases did somehow support the arguments he wished to make, he cannot explain the entirely fictitious citations.“In my judgment, the only realistic possibility is that Mr Rahman relied significantly on Gen AI to formulate the grounds and sought to disguise that fact when the difficulties were explored with him at the hearing.”The judge’s ruling was made in September and published on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingJudiciarynewsShareReuse this content"

Coordinated by the European Newspaper Publishers’ Association, the aim is to push the European Commission to open an investigation against Google under the EU Digital Services Act.Thethreat posed by AI Overviews, which gives users information without them having to click through to the original source by summarising searches with a block of text at the top of the results page, is among the main concerns of European news outlets.FIEG said it was also worried about the more recent AI Mode, which takes information from multiple sources and presents them as a chatbot.The federation argues that the Google services “violate fundamental provisions of the digital services act, with detrimental effects on Italian users, consumers and businesses”.“Google is becoming a traffic killer,” FIEG said in a statement, adding that the products not only directly compete with content produced by publishing firms, but also “reduces their visibility and discoverability, and thus their advertising revenues”.“This has serious consequences for the economic sustainability and diversity of the media, with all the risks associated with a lack of transparency and the proliferation of disinformation in democratic debate,” the statement said.AI might be creating a ‘permanent underclass’ but it’s the makers of the tech bubble who are replaceable | Van BadhamRead moreA study published in July by the UK-based Authoritas analytics company claimed AI Overviews, launched by Google last year, causedup to 80% fewer clickthroughs. The research, which was submitted as part of a legal complaint to the UK’s competition watchdog about the impact of Google AI Overviews, also found that links to YouTube – owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet – were more prominent compared with the normal search result system.A second study by the Pew Research Center, a US thinktank, also showed a big hit to referral traffic from Google AI Overviews, with users only clicking a link under an AI summary once every 100 times.Google claimed the studies were inaccurate and based on flawed methodology.Google AI Overviews arrived in Italy in March. In September, the country became the first in the EU to approve a comprehensive law regulating the use of artificial intelligence, including limiting child access and imposing prison terms on those who use the technology to cause harm, such as generating deepfakes.Giorgia Meloni’s government described the legislation, which aligns with theEU’s landmark AI Act, as a decisive move in influencing how AI is used across Italy.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingItalyEuropeGoogleAlphabetNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

Under laboratory tests, they were assumed to be 75% less polluting.The researchers analysed data from the onboard fuel consumption meters of 800,000 cars registered in Europe between 2021 and 2023. They found real-world carbon dioxide emissions from PHEVs in 2023 were 4.9 times greater than those from standardised laboratory tests, having risen from being 3.5 times greater in 2021.“Real-world emissions are going up, while official emissions are going down,” said Sofía Navas Gohlke, a researcher at Transport and Environment and the co-author of the report. “This is the gap that is getting worse and it is a real problem. As a result, PHEVs pollute almost as much as petrol cars.”The researchers attributed most of the gap to overestimates of the “utility factor” – the ratio of miles travelled in electric mode to the total miles travelled – finding that 27% of driving was done in electric mode even though official estimates assumed 84%. The European Commission has announced two corrections to the utility factor ratio that will narrow the gap but not close it entirely, according to the analysis.Even when the cars were driven in electric mode, the analysis found that levels of pollution were well above official estimates. The researchers said this was because electric motors were not strong enough to operate alone, with their engines burning fossil fuels for almost one-third of the distance travelled in electric mode.Patrick Plötz, head of energy economics at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, who was not involved in the study, said it was a “very useful contribution” after years in which parts of the automotive industry argued there was too little data to accurately assess real-world emissions.“The results demonstrate, beyond any doubt, that the gap between official and real-world PHEV fuel consumption and CO2emissions is much, much larger than for gasoline or diesel cars,” said Plötz, who has publishedresearchon the topic. “Any policy changes with respect to PHEVs should be made with utmost care and in the light of that data.”Hybrid cars have been drawn back into the political debate as carmakers have pressed the EU to weaken CO2targets. A ban on new combustion engine cars in 2035 has been subject to heavy lobbying from the automotive industry and opposition from member states with large car industries.“There must not be a drastic cut in 2035,” the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said after a summit last week with the country’s struggling automobile industry, promising to do “everything in [his] power” to achieve that. Other senior German politicians have floated plug-in hybrids as one example of possible “flexibilities” they could introduce to the legislation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They added that drivers of PHEVs would also be paying about €500 more a year in running costs than would be assumed under laboratory tests.“The bold claims that manufacturers like to make about their plug-in hybrid vehicles are clearly way off the mark,” said Colin Walker, a transport analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.“Consumers are being duped into believing that in buying a PHEV, they are helping the environment and saving money,” he said. “In reality, PHEVs are little better than regular petrol and diesel cars when it comes to the fuel they consume, the CO2they produce and the money they cost to run.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsEuropean UnionMotoringEuropeEthical and green livingGreenhouse gas emissionsAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The pricier of the two portable gaming devices dropping on 16 October, the all-black ROG Xbox Ally X will cost you a cool £799 (€899/$999/A$1599) to sample its splendour. (The less powerful ROG Xbox Ally, which comes in white, will run you £499/€599/$599/A$999.) Thankfully, the pricier option has said splendour in spades.I’ve put the ROG Xbox Ally X through its paces for the last few weeks, playing indie darlings and massive role-playing games throughout my apartment. Though the price tag is certainly a shocker (the Steam Deck OLED, a direct competitor, costs £479/€569/$549/A$899 for its cheaper model), the power packed into this comparatively smaller frame (291 x 122 x 51mm) is like nothing the portable gaming market has seen before.That power, coupled with its ability to play Xbox games through cloud gaming or its Play Anywhere initiative (where purchases and process carry between Xbox andPCplatforms), and PC games across various storefronts, makes it incredibly appealing to both Xbox loyalists and portable gaming fans alike. Though the ROG Xbox Ally X had a few hiccups during my time with it, and some user interface issues that interfered with performance, most of them were easily rectified and quickly forgotten once I was deep into playing a game.View image in fullscreenPlayable at home or on the go … ROG Xbox Ally X.Photograph: ROGSetting up the ROG Xbox Ally XSetting up the ROG Xbox Ally X isn’t frictionless. Though the device will launch into a dedicated full-screen Xbox experience that mimics both the Xbox console and PC app, it’s still a handheld running the Windows 11 operating system, and it needs an update before you can get going. This took a little time, and with all the pop-up notifications and steps of the standard Windows experience, it feels a bit odd for a gaming handheld.For the first day, despite adding my Xbox account immediately, the device told me that I didn’t have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – the upper tier of Microsoft’s gaming subscription service – and my attempts to re-link my account were in vain. The next day, it randomly worked. It also struggled to connect to my home wifi after waking from sleep mode – though weirdly, this also rectified itself after the first 24 hours.Once I got my various accounts connected (since this is a Windows handheld, you can also download PC game launchers like Steam, EpicGamesStore, and Blizzard’s Battle.net), the ROG Xbox Ally X ran pretty well.In a user friendly touch, it boots straight into the familiar Xbox user interface, but pulls games from the other game launchers, to ensure you can jump right into whatever you were just playing, no matter where it’s hosted.Thiscanbe an issue, however, if you’re playing say a Steam game, then jump back to the Xbox dedicated launcher and try to start a game through another storefront. The ROG Xbox Ally X doesn’t automatically close the last game you had open, or even ask you if you want to close it, which obviously kneecaps performance. And there were also a few moments where it kind of hung, suspended, in the Xbox interface and didn’t respond to any of my inputs.There was also a moment where the handheld slogged through a download of a rather beefy RPG, repeatedly losing connection whenever it would go idle, forcing me to resume the process manually. But after a reboot, it sailed through the rest of the file download without a hitch.View image in fullscreenSwitching between applications … ROG Xbox Ally X.Photograph: ROGROG Xbox Ally performanceThe above issues can hopefully be solved with a simple user interface (UI) update, because when it’s not being a bit finicky, the ROG Xbox Ally X performs incredibly well. There’s a bit of sluggishness when trying to boot up at low battery levels (sub-15%), but Supergiant Games’ beloved roguelike sequel,Hades II, launches fast and plays perfectly with no discernible load times between areas. Meatier games such asAvowedand PC mainstays like Backyard Baseball run smooth as butter, with beautiful frame rates and very little load times.Though the ROG Xbox Ally X doesn’t have an OLED screen, I’d be surprised if anyone really misses it. Games look incredible on its 7-inch, 1080p display. The glimmers and glints of Hades II’s mostly stationary characters are a visual feast; I let out a soft gasp when the moon goddess Selene first appeared, her pearlescent gown shimmering blue and sea-foam green.Xbox and Asus cleverly routed some system resources towards higher frame rates, and it pays off when playing a game as visually busy and punishing as Hades II–at no point am I so overwhelmed by what’s playing out that I can’t make sense of the battle at hand and act accordingly.The speakers are also fantastic for immersion. At one point in Hades II, I walked past the goddess of the hunt, Artemis, who was sitting in a moonlit glade quietly singing to herself. As I moved, her song emanated only from the left speaker, telling me she was still there behind me, even though I could no longer see her. Those kinds of beautiful details really shine.As for looks, the ROG Xbox Ally X may be initially odd – it’s like someone cut an Xbox controller in half and then soldered a screen between its grips – but the matt black finish is incredibly sleek, and the adjustable LEDs that ring the joysticks offer just the right amount of gamer-style finish.View image in fullscreenPowerful hardware … ROG Xbox Ally X.Photograph: ROGGaming on the go, or on the couchDuring my time with the ROG Xbox Ally X, I’ve played it lying prone in bed, propped up on the couch, leaning on the counter while waiting for pasta water to boil, and at my desk during writing breaks. After10 minutes of hands-on timethis summer, I wasn’t sure if the rather large handheld would be comfortable for me during longer sessions. But actually, holding it is comfortable even after a couple of hours of playtime. At 715g, though heavier than the less powerful ROG Xbox Ally (670g) and Steam Deck OLED (640g), the weight difference is negligible, especially because the controller-inspired grips are incredibly ergonomic. The only time I felt uncomfortable was after sitting with it held up above me on the couch with no elbow or wrist support; then, my pinkies got a little sore from holding its weight.The battery life is great (coming in at 80Wh, more than the ROG Xbox Ally’s 60Wh), considering what’s under the hood. I could play Hades II for two hours straight with no issue, including a run that lasted 20 minutes at 22%, which only dropped the battery to 10%. Although parts of the handheld got a little warm during especially long play sessions, it was never excessively hot.ROG Xbox Ally X’s game libraryAs for games, the device cleverly leverages the Xbox Play Anywhere initiative, which reflects Microsoft’s recent push for you to access its games, including a library of 1,000 purchasable Xbox and Xbox Game Pass subscription games across multiple devices, such as on PC, Xbox consoles, and now ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, with your progress intact.As someone who once owned a Steam Deck, and who has had an Xbox Game Pass for years, the ROG Xbox Ally X is my platonic ideal for a handheld console. I prefer the way Xbox controllers feel in my hands, and this device mimics that. I enjoy dipping into the Xbox Game Pass library to try out a new game, and this device lets me take that on the go – and if it’s a Play Anywhere title, which most games are, I also don’t need to worry about having internet access to enjoy it.If you’ve got the funds and are in the market for a powerful gaming handheld that can not only play PC games from a digital store of your choosing, but also an impressive suite of Xbox games, the ROG Xbox Ally X would be a good end of year splurge.The ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X is out today, October 16; £479-£799/$599-$999Explore more on these topicsGamesXboxHandheldPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Democrats and others are right to warn against illegal and unauthorised use of forceThu 16 Oct 2025 13.49 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe drumbeat is growing louder. Covert operations are supposed to remain just that, but on Wednesday Donald Trump confirmed that hehad approved secret CIA actionsin Venezuela and suggested that he was considering strikes on its territory. These comments follow the administration’s extrajudicial killings at sea: attacks on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean that have left at least 27 dead – a frightening new precedentdenounced by UN experts as illegal. The US has already built up forces in the region, with about 6,500 troops now stationed there. “No to war in the Caribbean … No to regime change … No to coups d’état orchestrated by the CIA,” railed Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s dictator, after Mr Trump’s remarks.The US president’srepeated claimthat each boat strike saves 25,000 American lives is even more preposterous than it first sounds. The fentanyl that killed 48,000 people in the US last year did not come from Venezuela; most of it is from Mexico. But Mr Maduro’s regime looksincreasingly isolated. The US has designated Venezuela’sTren de Araguagang as a terrorist organisation that has “invaded” the US, claiming that Mr Maduro ispersonally responsible. It has used that posturing to justify deportations and toboast– against the evidence – that Mr Trump has cut violent crime in cities.This administration has proved unexpectedly active in Latin America, apparently the one sphere of foreign policy where the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is making the running. He has long sought to oust Mr Maduro for both ideological and material reasons. Other hawkish figures in the administration, such as Stephen Miller, share this view. Mr Trump initially licensedanother, simultaneous approach; his envoy Richard Grenell brokered agreements on deportation flights and energy contracts. Many believe that the hawks have prevailed, with reports that Mr Trump ordered Mr Grenellto end talks.That CIA operations and war planning are being aired so enthusiastically may suggest that the US hopesregime changewill come through Mr Maduro fleeing (unlikely), or that it still cherishes the long-held (and so far unevidenced) wish that military and security forces will turn on him. Others suspect that this is the latest example of Mr Trump’s blunt “or else” approach to foreign policy – designed to extract more from Mr Maduro.The US has a long and inglorious history of intervention in Latin America. But Mr Trump will be wary of angering Maga supporters with military action and of looking like a paper tiger if Mr Maduro endures again. The attempt to remove him in Mr Trump’s first term, with the US backing the then opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, proved a fiasco. Last week’s decision to award the Nobel peace prize toMaría Corina Machado– whose opposition movement is widely believed to have won last year’s elections, promptingstill more brutal repressionby the regime – is a symbolic boost for those standing against Mr Maduro, but is highlyunlikelyto be a turning point in itself. And if insiders depose him, Madurismo without Maduro might not be an improvement for Venezuelans.The Trump administration may convince itself that military action can be strictly delimited, given Mr Maduro’s restricted options. But Democrats andhuman rights groupsare right to warn it against illegal and unauthorised uses of force, endangering the lives of Venezuelans, increasing the insecurity they face, and risking escalation.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

At oral arguments in Louisiana v Callais on Wednesday, theUS supreme courtappeared ready to strike down section 2, effectively completing the gradual nullification of the Voting Rights Act that it has pursued for over a decade.The case stems from new congressional districting maps that were drawn inLouisianaafter the 2020 census, which found both that the state was eligible for six seats in theHouse of Representativesand that its population was about one-third Black. The state initially drew maps that featured only one majority-Black congressional district, rejecting seven more racially fair maps; voters sued, and federal courts ordered Louisiana to comply with the Voting Rights Act by drawing new maps in which Black voters would be a majority in a second district, thereby reflecting their share of the population and giving Black Louisianans an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their choice.But now, a group of people identifying themselves as “non-African-American voters” have sued to get those racially proportionate maps thrown out, arguing that enforcement of the VRA violates their own rights under the 14th and 15th amendments. They claim the maps drawn to remedy racial discrimination against Black people in fact constitute racial discrimination against non-Black (read: white) people. The court seems likely to side with them.If they do, it will mark the end of the Voting Rights Act, widely considered the crowning achievement of thecivil right movement, which the supreme court, under John Roberts, has been dismantling for years. In 2013’s Shelby county v Holder, the court struck down much of section 5, which had required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to get federal preclearance for changes to its voting laws.In subsequent cases, the court has repeatedly narrowed the conditions under which litigants can bring voting rights claims and expanded states’ leeway to make voting laws that would have previously been deemed discriminatory. Writing for the majority in Shelby, Chief Justice Roberts claimed that racial animus and inequality had diminished enough that such a regime was not necessary, and indeed violated the rights of states. As states imposed a slew of new voting restrictions in the aftermath, the gap between Black and white voter participation ratesgrew dramatically. It expanded twice as much in districts that had previously been subjected to the section 5 preclearance regime.On Wednesday, the court seemed determined to apply the same logic that it used in Shelby county to section 2, demanding that Janai Nelson, the head of the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, justify why section 2 should still be efficacious and should not be considered to have somehow expired. Justices Kavanaugh and Alito asserted that the racial gerrymander was justified if it was intended as a partisan gerrymander – that is, that the lawmakers’ stated or professed intentions was what mattered, and not the racially discriminatory impact of the gerrymander.Previous supreme court precedent, as well as ample evidence from the congressional record, has said that discriminatory impact, rather than intent, is sufficient to constitute illegal racial discrimination – but at oral argument, the Republicans on the court, along with those representing the litigants, did not seem to think that this should matter. As she rebutted these arguments in the guise of asking questions from the bench, one could hear the exhaustion in Ketanji Brown Jackson’s voice. The remedies, she sputtered, “are so tied up with race, because race is the initial problem!” Jackson has been the court’s most passionate and articulate advocate for the Reconstruction amendments and for the legacy of the civil rights movement, but she seemed to know that her colleagues were not listening to her.The case reflects two major trends of the Roberts court: hostility to racial justice claims brought by minorities, and a willingness to invert civil rights law and the Reconstruction amendments alike to create interpretations in which these legal traditions function to entrench, rather than challenge, historical hierarchies of race and gender. Louisiana’s attorney general – who has switched sides in the case since it was initially argued last year, joining an opposition to the Voting Rights Act – claimed that to assume that Black voters would vote differently than white voters – which inLouisiana, they overwhelmingly do – would be to unconstitutionally impose a racial stereotype. This facile fiction elicited exasperation from Justice Kagan.But the attorney general knew his audience. Roberts has long been an enemy of practices that attempt to remedy historical and ongoing racial discrimination, claiming that the law mandates that state and private actors alike take no interest in such projects and attempt facially race-blind policies in everything from voting rights enforcement to college admissions – no matter how racially discriminatory against Black Americans such practices prove to be in reality. “The way to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” he oncememorably said, “is to stop discriminating on the basis of race” – that is, to stop trying to account for or combat racism with official policy. The result will be that if the court rules in Louisiana’s favor, it will no longer be illegal, in practice, to racially gerrymander congressional districts to minimize and dilute Black voter power. But it will be illegal to use race to redistrict in such a way that restores Black voter power.It is apparently through this fanciful and motivated reasoning that Roberts and his colleagues have decided that any move to secure Black Americans’ voting rights and equality in fact violates the very constitutional amendments that were meant to secure their voting rights and equality. The Voting Rights Act does not violate the 15th amendment; it enforces it, and gave the United States, during the 60 years or so of its enactment, its only plausible claim to being a real democracy. To say that the VRA contradicts the 15th amendment is more than just bad reasoning. It is bad faith. But bad faith, increasingly, is what the supreme court operates under.If the supreme court rules in favor of the “non-African-American” voters and vacates what is left of the Voting Rights Act, as they are expected to, then a decision will probably come down sometime in June, just a few months before the November 2026 midterms. The resulting racial gerrymanders are expected to net Republicans19 House seats.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOpinionRaceUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsLouisianacommentShareReuse this content"

Thank you,Benjamin Netanyahu. Thank you,Jared Kushner. Let’s all pause, shall we, and have a moment of appreciation for these three wise men who have finally brought peace to the Middle East.Blessedare the peacemakers!And, of course, thank you to the Israeli military which, as a US taxpayer, I have done my part tohelp fund. To echoKushner: “Instead of replicating the barbarism of the enemy, [Israel] chose to be exceptional.”It took exceptional restraint, I’m sure, not to level every single building and destroy all the arable land in Gaza. Instead only about90% of homesare estimated to be damaged or destroyed. The school system has also been eradicated: according to Unesco-Unosat satellite damage assessments, more than 95% of school buildings require rehabilitation or reconstruction. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)has similarly said97% of tree crops, 95% of shrubs and 82% of annual crops are gone.It took exceptional humanity, I’m sure, not to kill every single child in Gaza. Instead a mere 20,000 children are dead, probably anunderestimate, and an unknown number are rotting under50m tonnesof debris. The toxic rubble is now home to thebiggest cohortof child amputees in the world.So, again: thank you, thank you, thank you.What do you reckon? Am I doing this right? Am I grateful enough? Because, judging by the coverage of this supposed “peace deal”, this is the sort of gratitude that is expected of Palestinians right now. We’re expected to be ever so appreciative that the Gaza strip hasn’t been completely nuked or entirely occupied. We’re expected to ignore the increasing number ofbrutal settler attacksin the West Bank, as if this was an issue completely unrelated to Gaza. Ignore the fact that Israel is still arbitrarily imprisoning Palestinians likeLayan Nasirwithout charge and without any evidence being presented against them. We’re expected to feel celebratory that the “war” is over. We’re expected to believe that this is what a path to peace looks like.The Guardian view on peace in Gaza: the relief is real, but Trump’s promise of a ‘golden age’ rings hollow | EditorialRead moreDon’t get me wrong, of course I am glad that the bombing has stopped in Gaza, and that a ceasefire is in place. I am ecstatic that more aid is now going into the strip, even though Israel, which has longweaponized food, keepsthreateningto throttle the amount of supplies let in.But I am not celebrating the end of the “war” because this was not a war.Childrenandtoddlersare not systematically shot in the head by snipers during a war.IVF centersandmaternity patientsdon’t tend to be targeted in wars. A place is not deliberatelyrendered uninhabitableduring a war. No, this was not a war. It was, as scores of human rights experts and international organizations have concluded,a genocide.Genocides don’t just happen overnight; dehumanization is normally a crucialpreparatorystep. And, conversely, humanization is an essential foundation for long-term peace, justice and accountability. There can be no real path to peace until the dehumanization of Palestinians stops. Until Israelis, and their allies, see Palestinians as equal human beings rather than “barbarians” and “human animals”. Until Israeli politicians such as Nissim Vaturi, deputy speaker of the Knesset, do not feel comfortable that every child born in Gaza today is “already a terrorist, from the moment of his birth”.Over the past two years, more people have been educating themselves aboutthe 100 years’ waron Palestine. Support for Israel is atrecord lowsin the US as people learn more aboutapartheid, settler violence and occupation. Palestinians have been humanized among many ordinary people who can’t quite swallow the idea that burning displaced civilians alive in supposed “safe zones” andexecuting healthcareworkers is just an unfortunate part of a normal war.Among world leaders, policymakersand the media, however, the dehumanization of Palestinians only seems to have ramped up. See, for example, a recent episode of Real Time With Bill Maher on HBO, where the CNN commentator and former Obama adviser Van Jones jokingly referred to “dead Gaza babies”. He’s now apologized for being “insensitive” but can you imagine a joke like that being made by a major media figure about dead Israeli hostages? Of course not, because Israelis are seen as human beings. It’s also worth noting that Jones’s fellow panelist, Thomas Friedman of the New York Times, didn’t push back at all about this “joke”. And why would he? This is a man who wrote a column comparing the Middle East to theanimal kingdomand Arabs toinsects.Van Jones, by the way, made that joke about dead Gaza babies while claiming that Iran and Qatar are running a disinformation campaign to manipulate young Americans into caring about Gaza. Ironically, however,hundreds of millions of dollarsare now being spent on a propaganda campaign trying to convince young Americans not to care about Palestinians. US marketing companies have been working on a “bot-based program” to amplify pro-Israel narratives on Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube and other platforms. Google has a$45m contractwith Netanyahu’s office to spread Israeli governmental talking points. AndDrop Site News reportedlast week that Jones himself, along with journalists at places such as the New York Times, are now “mentors in a fellowship founded for pro-Israel ‘information war’”. This is not what a path to peace looks like; this is what rehabilitating the image of a country that has committed genocide looks like.Life in Gaza may go from utter hell to mere nightmare. What happens now? | Hussein Agha and Robert MalleyRead moreAnd the genocide, I should note, hasn’t stopped. Yes there is a ceasefire, but already it is very clear that it is an Israeli-style ceasefire, along the lines of the “ceasefire” inLebanon, where Israel is still allowed to fire. On Tuesday, at least five Palestinianswere killedin an Israeli attack in Gaza City. Israel said its soldiers fired against “suspects” who were “crossing the yellow line”, which is the line to which Israel’s military pulled back under the ceasefire deal. Israel has a habit of shooting people who cross invisible lines; IDF soldiersare on recordsaying that they were ordered to shoot anyone entering what soldiers defined as no-go zones, regardless of whether they posed a threat. “There’s an imaginary line that they tell us all the Gazan people know it, and that they know they are not allowed to pass it,” one IDF soldier told Sky News in July. “But how can they know?”Again, I am thankful that the killing has slowed down. But let us not be naive here. Gaza has been rendered uninhabitable for a reason;settler attacksandhome demolitionsin the West Bank have ramped up for a reason. When people like the Israeli prime minister talk about “peace” in the region, the peace they appear to be referencing is the peace of finally being able to ignore the existence of Palestinians. A peace in which Palestinians have been expelled from their homeland.In May, for example, as Haaretz noted, the Israeli daily Maariv reported that Netanyahu told the Knesset foreign affairs and security committee: “We are destroying more and more homes. They have nowhere to return to. The only expected outcome will be the desire of Gazans to emigrate out of the Strip.” Netanyahu has made frequent references to the idea of mass populationtransfer from Gaza, the so-called “Trump plan”. This is the “peace” that Israel and the US seem to be working towards.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist and the author of Strong Female LeadExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warOpinionGazaIsraelUS foreign policyPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Women in Britain should know thatZoe WilliamsADF, a conservative Christian lobby group that counts among its allies JD Vance, has stated that its goal is to see abortion rights curtailed in BritainThu 16 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTShareNigel Farage’s obsession with free speech has become the mood music of his own party, the Conservatives andthe BBC, so it shouldn’t have been shocking or troubling to learn that he’d testified in the US Congress on 3 September on the subject of this elemental liberty, and how profoundly at risk it is in the UK.His position we could recite in our sleep – it hasn’t deviated, and remains nonsense on stilts. Free speech is only at risk in the UK insofar as 80-year-olds can now be arrested for opposing genocide with homemade placards, and that’s quite a big “only”. But in Nigel’s upside-down world he is remorselessly censored, and a leftist cabal is still calling the shots – and will only get stronger. The troubling element wasn’t what he said, but whoorchestratedhis appearance.TheAlliance Defending Freedom(ADF) is a conservative Christian lobby group whose allies include JD Vance and speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who used to work as an ADF lawyer. While their focus, brokering Farage’s appearance in Congress (the formal invitation came from the House judiciary committee) is on free speech, the legal challenges they bring, both in the US and internationally, tend to use the issue instrumentally as a way to gain allies in their battle against reproductive rights.ADF UK has given legal support to people who’ve been prosecuted for protesting outside abortion clinics, breaching the UK’s “buffer zones”, and to the midwife who wassuspended from her jobfor making anti-abortion statements on social media. It also uses the existence of legislation against this harassment as proof of a free-speech crisis in the country. The two issues are thus conjoined in a ratchet, where any victory in one becomes grist for the other.The buffer-zones debate works particularly well, appealing as it does to a progressive sense of fair-mindedness – come on, liberal, if you want to be allowed to call out a genocide, who are you to stop a Christian calling out a pregnant woman for murdering a baby? It’s an argument whose bad faith you can smell a mile off, but it’s enough to sow confusion and turn the wokerati against itself.When Farage was head of the Brexit party, it had no stance on abortion. The New York Timescould find no recordof his having done so, anyway, and knowing him as we all do, you can’t imagine it: it doesn’t chime at all with the smoking, pint-loving, British pound sterling and sovereignty guy, to be digging around in women’s business. Yet as if by magic, suddenly last November, he wanted to talk aboutrolling backthe abortion time limit “given that we can now save babies at 22 weeks” (the time limit is 24). By May this year, the current limit was “absolutely ludicrous” , according to Nigel. Although he did say to New York Times reporters that it was “bollocks” to say he had found a new interest in the topic of reproductive rights.ADF lawyers have told journalists explicitly that their goal, long term, is to see abortion rights curtailed in the UK – to which one’s every synapse screams, “in your dreams, you hubristic fantasists”. But we’ve seen how fast the current Labour leadership and the Conservatives scramble to meetReform UKhalfway.We have already seen how influenced by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 the Conservatives are: from seeing renewable energy as a way to future-proof the economy to now seeing it as a woke conspiracy we can’t afford. Five years ago, it would have been considered tawdry to be interested in the physiology of whoever was in the toilet cubicle next to you, and now it is a matter for the UK supreme court. Attitudes to migration were becoming steadily more positive from 2015. However, in 2023, theyflipped negative, and have since galvanised a hardcore of protesters whose aggression has since torched asylum hotels and left foreign-born carers scared to get out of their cars.Which politicians do you trust to stand up to what is basically authoritarian empire-building? Because the time to start supporting them is now, not five to midnight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its creation as a marketable entity in the 1960s by the late Queen Elizabeth II was meant to “modernise” the monarchy for the 20th century. It worked, but only up to a point. Her son Prince Andrew has long been its biggest liability,this week in troubleyet again due to his alleged behaviour within that ghoulish circle, the friends of Jeffrey Epstein.King Charles now has a decision to make as to how far he can allow his brother’s past behaviour to tarnish the family’s image. That image is the essence of royalty.Monarchyhas no other authentication. The constitutional position of head of state in a democracy is subject to the will of parliament, but also to the “will” of the people. It was the latter will that forced the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936 over marrying a divorcee. A royal personage cannot stand for re-election. He or she is acceptable to the generality of public opinion or they are nothing.When in 1969 the late queen was persuaded, reluctantly, by her husband, Philip, and her press secretary, William Heseltine, to allow a film to be made called Royal Family, it was a constitutional decision. Elizabeth was not to retreat like other postwar European monarchs at the time into an anonymous obscurity, to stick to their bicycles. She would refresh Britain’s semi-divine concept of monarchy as embodied in an “ordinary family”. It was portrayed as “the Firm”, a term that originated with Elizabeth’s father, George VI.It worked. The family looked lovely as their young children picnicked by a Scottish loch. The film was watched and admired by millions. But there was a lurking risk. One day the same children would be different. They would be tormented teenagers, rampaging twentysomethings and matrimonial casualties. They might be offered grand palaces and safe jobs, “representing” the monarch the length and breadth of the land. But then what? Would they all behave? It was like writing a play when you have already cast the actors. The children became instant global celebrities.Elizabeth was lucky in Charles and Anne, who on the whole were impeccable. She then experienced upsets. One was her annus horribilis of 1992, when offspring Charles, Andrew and Anne all broke with their partners. Diana, Princess of Wales andSquidgygatewere broadcast round the world and Windsor Castle was ablaze. Every aide and butler could sell their memoirs. In a Gallup poll that year, only26%of the British public thought the monarchy should continue as it was.Another crisis came in 1997 with the death of Diana and its initially woeful mishandling by the late queen. Her personal approval rating sank toan all-time lowof 57%. Charles’s fell to 40%. Serious questions were raised of the future of the crown. At such times monarchy has nowhere to turn for sustenance but to public opinion. Its image is dependent on the media and the reaction to how it performs its rituals.The so-called cycling monarchies such as Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium did not go down the same path as the late queen. They became figureheads, anthropomorphic thrones, legacies of history and tradition, but they hold office strictly at the declaration of elected parliaments. Such monarchs practise none of Britain’s nonsense about religious anointment. They head up no “family firm”. Their relatives, close and distant, can go about their normal lives and do normal jobs. The king of the Netherlands stilloccasionally pilots a KLM jet. When in 1990 King Baudouin of Belgium refused to sign an abortion bill he was curtly told to abdicate for the day.Prince Andrew was already beingeased out of the limelightbefore the publication ofVirginiaGiuffre’s memoir. The next move is for the future king, William, to plan a refashioned monarchy. He has already indicated his intention to live not in London but in a modest house in Windsor Park. He will presumably hand his Westminster estate to the government, and its gardens to the public. That would be all to the good.But above all, William should release his children. He should do away with the royal family brand, disband the Firm andtake to his bicycle. No more Andrews.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was about one year old and we were watching her bounce happily in her high chair, egg smeared across both cheeks as she shoved pieces of fritter into her mouth.I realised with pride it was true: she wascomfortable. My pride was followed quickly by unease. How long had it been since I could say I was comfortable with myself?My daughter is almost four now and I’ve thought of my father-in-law’s words many times since that day. She’s at a precious age, no longer a toddler and still just on the precipice of childhood proper. She interacts with the world without self-consciousness and has not yet learned that society may expect something different from her.How does the government justify its backdown on super reforms? | Fiona KatauskasRead moreWhen she expresses hunger and when she eats, she does so with joyful abandon. When she takes a mouthful of something delicious we can see a whole-body response: she closes her eyes, tilts her head back and dances her shoulders up and down.I find these moments most affecting when they happen in social settings with celebratory food. I’ve watched her so completely zero in on potato-on-a-stick at a football game that not even a big strong purple Wiggle appearing would have broken her focus. I’ve watched her happily dance back to a party table for her third, fourth, fifth slice of fairy bread. She is completely unburdened by self-surveillance.Many girls will learn, if not explicitly taught then by cultural osmosis, the notion they shouldn’t be outwardly hungry. Whether a girl’s hunger is literally for food or it’s yearning for something greater in her life – a high-powered career, an unabashed artistic practice, a passionate affair – she is often taught to not be so honest in her expression of it.Watching my daughter’s strong sense of self has forced me to reflect on my own adolescence through the early 2000s, when our wildly misogynistic pop culture filtered down to the schoolyard. I once overheard a high-school boyfriend say I looked ugly when I ate. Instead of dumping him, I simply stopped eating when we were together.Later, in my 20s, when Instagram brought with it thefirst wave of diet culturemasquerading as “wellness”, I was primed to try it all: juice cleanses, appetite-suppressing teas, “quitting” sugar. I once lied to a colleague that I was eating soup for lunch when I had, in fact, poured green juice into a bowl.These memories are horrifying to me now and thank God for that. Thank God that in my daughter’s world there is no morality ascribed to food, there is nogoodorbad,or that most disgusting of office kitchen diet-speak,naughty. There is just desire and pleasure and satiety.It might be a little trite to say that adults can learn from watching children interact with the world, and any parent knows the humbling and primal understanding of their child’s innocence and vulnerability. More surprising to me has been the realisation that by parenting I can alsounlearn insidious lessons once taught to me and then internalised.Watching from Australia while Donald Trump targets my home of Chicago with armed troops prompts deep questions | Miles HerbertRead moreOne way I have started actively practising this unlearning is by imagining myself repeating any self-loathing inner monologue out loud to my daughter. Especially as while I may have mostly escaped diet culture’s clutches,beauty cultureis a little harder to outrun.Darling, mummy is tired because she’s spent [redacted] hours comparing her face to celebrities shilling beauty products. Imagine telling her how much screen time I’ve devoted to Googling cosmetic solutions instead of, say, going outside or making art or experiencing even a single sensory pleasure. Absurd!I am determined to model self-respect and self-love, to build for my daughter a strong defence against the world which one day soon will come crashing in. Living as I always deserved to in the first place will show her that she deserves it too. This should apply to all of parenting, really: the responsibility and privilege of it is immense.My daughter has recently entered a phase of pickiness around dinners. Frustrating as it may be, and I won’t pretend I exhibit the greatest patience in these moments – not even close – I’m comforted that even this developmental phase is about exercising a level of autonomy and power in her small world. It’s something I hope she will always feel empowered to do.One night recently I placed dinner in front of her and she told me with a frown, “you don’t make it yummy”. I can’t take offence, even for a second. I’m buoyed that she hasn’t learned to protect anyone else’s feelings first. She knows only what she likes, and she likes it yummy.Léa Antigny is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionSocial mediaFamilyHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

The words of peace following the Gaza ceasefire ring hollowThu 16 Oct 2025 09.04 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 12.33 EDTShareLast Monday, when the US president, Donald Trump, addressed the Knesset alongside the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, my compatriot lawmaker Ayman Odeh and I raised a banner calling them to “Recognise Palestine”. We were brutallyexpelled by forcefrom the parliament’s plenum, revealing the fragile state of the supposed “only democracy in the Middle East”. How can Trump and Netanyahu speak of peace in the Middle East without recognition of the people deprived for decades of their basic liberties and rights under vicious occupation?Nowhere is the deceit more clear than in the occupied West Bank. There, the words of peace are but a weak and distant voice, but the horrifying sounds ofsettler violenceand terror still echo loudly. More than 30 occurrences of settler violence against Palestinians have beendocumentedsince the announcement of Trump’s 20-point plan at the end of September, including physical assaults, theft of agricultural produce and torching of vehicles and property.The rise of settler terrorism is not coincidental. This period marks the start of the harvest seasons. More than a vital economic event, it is an important social and national moment that exhibits endurance under occupation. Precisely for these reasons, year after year settlers target Palestiniansduring this precious time. During the 2024 harvest period, Yesh Din (an Israeli human rights group that collects and disseminates information regarding violations of Palestinians’ human rights in the West Bank)documented 113 separate incidentsof violence, harassment, harvest-thwarting or damage to olive trees and crops involving Israeli civilians and soldiers, which took place on lands belonging to 51 Palestinian villages, towns and communities.Yesh Din also found that “Israeli security forces appeared to have played a greater role in obstructing the olive harvest”. In about 70% of forceful prevention of access to lands, soldiers, border police officers and settlement civilian security coordinators (CSCs) were actually present. They either personally prevented Palestinians from accessing and harvesting in their own lands, or failed to stop settlers who harassed or assaulted them.This comes as no surprise, as the leader of the settlers’ political party,Bezalel Smotrich, was appointed as an additional minister in the Ministry of Defence in charge of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT). In Umm al-Khair, for example, a special COGAT unituprooted private olive treesof Palestinians, citing lack of permits, but ignored violations of an illegal nearby settler outpost. Last week, the Jerusalem district court ruled to halt all building work in the outpost, which was built on lands seized by Israel and unlawfully transferred to settlers.In the occupied West Bank, settler terrorism is nothing but a tool by the government to pursue de-facto annexation. Earlier this month, Smotrichled a marchof thousands of settlers in support of annexation of the West Bank. He was quoted as saying, “We are continuing to take hold with our feet of the Land of Israel with many pioneers, many heroes, and hundreds of thousands of settlers who live in this part of the land … we need to normalise it and make it eternal.”The settlers and their supporters in the Knesset are clear on their motives and intentions. Why, then, do political leaders in the west refrain from meaningful sanctions and diplomatic measures? Smotrich wassanctioned by the UKin June, but the effect of the sanction has been minimal. He may not be able to travel to the UK and tour the West End, but he still enjoys the ministerial power to grab lands in the West Bank. Even in the announcement of sanctions, the UK highlighted they take place “in his personal capacity” solely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve heard that before – the result was more bloodshed | Jason BurkeRead moreIf the UK government acknowledges the reality of settler violence and its grave implications on Palestinian life, why does it stillallow settlement produceto be sold in markets and shops in Britain? If Starmer is serious aboutrecognition of Palestineas a state, how come it allows the Israeli government to violate its sovereignty with such violent means? Or was the recognition an empty ploy to shut down dissenting voices in the UK, a hollow act only to be realised in the rebranding of some maps?A just peace must respect the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people for self-recognition, sovereignty and liberty from military occupation and siege. Only when every human being’s dignity between the river and sea is respected can we truly say peace has been achieved.True peace requires an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel: this is the sole formula that enjoys consensus among the international community, the Palestinian national movement and the Israeli peace camp.Trump may have inflicted pressure on Netanyahu to halt the genocide, but he probably only did so because the burden of his relationship with the pariah regime of Netanyahu had become too great. The mass protests across the globe for the liberation ofPalestine, and the unwavering anti-government demonstrations inside Israel, are the real forces behind this pressure.It is thanks to this enormous civil movement that a ceasefire has been signed, the hostages released and the people of Gaza can enjoy safeguard from annihilation. After the ceasefire agreement has been signed, it is vital to keep applying this pressure. The world has turned a blind eye to the atrocities in Gaza for too long; it must not repeat the same mistake in theWest Bank.Dr Ofer Cassif is a member of the Knesset, representing the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality (Hadash) since 2019Explore more on these topicsWest BankOpinionGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

They have a picture of what homelessness should look like, and my family and I don’t fit into it – I’m at university studying medicine now. But people like me hide in plain sight. They’re your neighbours until suddenly they’re not. They’re everywhere and nowhere, all at the same time.My family came to the UK after becoming refugees during the Iraq war, and were homeless, repeatedly, for years – moving from friends’ house to friends’ house, or B&B to B&B. Each new place meant a new school, a new set of friends and a new set of rules I had to get used to. Over time, I think my siblings and I became pretty immune to the anxiety you feel when starting again.I don’t remember all the places we stayed, though most of them were cold. In one, we lived above a party animal, blaring music so loud it would make my head thump as we tried to go to sleep. Others had rats – once my sister burst out of the bathroom screaming, in the middle of the night, because one had emerged when she lifted the toilet seat.In another place there were four of us in one room with all our belongings, while my siblings and I played human Tetris in bunkbeds. I remember reading to my younger brother there, doing my best to give him that normal family experience despite the chaos.Government figurespublished todayshow that there are now more than 132,000 households living in all forms of temporary accommodation in England, including more than 172,000 dependent children. It’s a record high –up 8.2% on 2024– surpassing the last record set earlier this year.The conditions in temporary accommodation are often well below the standard anyone should be expected to accept – it can be cramped, or cold or dangerous. Official data recently found that temporary accommodation in England may have contributed to the deaths of74 children in just five years.It wasn’t until I was much older, during the Covid pandemic – my GCSE year – that I realised what I’d experienced as a child hadn’t been normal.Usually when we moved schools, we just left, without telling them. But the pandemic meant my mum and dad lost their income from their jobs and things started to get even harder, so I’d had to apply for a bursary. That meant telling my school I was homeless.When I showed a teacher proof of our household income, her face just dropped. She couldn’t believe the number on the paper. She had to ask me again if I was sure of the amount, because she was struggling to believe that that figure had sustained my whole family. When I saw the look on her face, I realised this was not a normal way to live.Leaving all your friends behind and starting afresh year after year just wasn’t normal. No one spoke about it growing up, and I didn’t even understand what was going on. When we were put in a B&B, I had thought we were on holiday. Looking back, I realised it wasn’t a holiday, and it wasn’t through choice, but my parents were pretty good at acting as if it was.My family are now stably housed – we’re safe and happy.After my teacher found out about our situation, she put us on free school meals, which helped massively. I could actually think straight in lessons, I could stay after school for longer because I wasn’t hungry, and teachers stopped pestering me for not having textbooks. Now I’m studying medicine.But today’s figures are a reminder that I’m one of the lucky ones. Thousands are trapped in the same situation I experienced. The instability, the risk, the rats – and the cold.The worst thing is that we could stop this if we wanted to. We know what causes homelessness, which means we know how to end it. That means building more social homes, and it means creating a welfare system that allows people to live in dignity. That would have made all the difference for us – having an affordable, social home would have meant we could have stayed in one place, and had some stability. There are now more than1.3m householdsin England alone on waiting lists for a social home, and meanwhile the Guardian has just revealed thatLabour plans to slashalready-low affordable housing targets for developers.When the Labour government came to power,it promiseda strategy to end homelessness. Fifteen months later, we are yet to see it. The same goes for thechild povertystrategy.While we wait, more people are going through what my siblings and I did.I’m working with Crisis, the homelessness charity, to call on ministers to urgently deliver a strategy to end homelessness for everyone. Any meaningful plan for change must surely lead to the creation of a society where we can all thrive, because we all have access to a decent, affordable home.We moved from place to place, but none of them were home, because we didn’t feel comfortable living there.I hadn’t realised at the time, but you miss out on a lot, growing up in those circumstances. The milestones I imagine people my age would have cherished didn’t really exist. Looking back, it kind of felt as if everyone else was making small leaps on little stones to cross a river, while my family and I had to wade through, our shoes drenched.It wasn’t normal to grow up like that, and no one else should have to.Isra Sulevani is a fourth-year medical student and lived experience homelessness campaigner for CrisisDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Our ordeal has changed, but it’s far from overThu 16 Oct 2025 06.33 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 20.47 EDTShareThewar has ended, and it’s time for me to return to my coffee, my bread and my poetry. Yet I don’t know what it means to return to life, after death has lived within us down to the marrow. Death had us memorised by heart, reciting our names one by one with unwavering precision. We grew accustomed to it too, in all its forms and colours, until funerals became a daily ritual, much like a weather report we already know by heart. It rained death every day, and our homes scattered like dry leaves in an autumn wind.But another war has begun, of a different kind, more ruthless. The battles no longer take place only in the streets, but in every moment of life, in every step across the rubble, in every attempt to reclaim what remains of our daily spirit. The first chapter of this new war was the brutal anticipation of the roads leading to what remains of homes, or heaps of stones. With the destruction stretching as far as the eye can see, the roads guided us toward what is left of ourselves and our memory.Now, ifIsraelallows us to live, death will pour meaning into life. We must repair our dictionaries, reclaim our morning rituals, let the plates return to their tables and the road regain its usual calm on the way to school. And I must dust off my knees and ride the horse once more.Meanwhile, Salam, my uncle’s granddaughter, is discovering food for the very first time. She touches its colours and explores its flavours with her tiny senses. Having grown up on lentils alone, since the day she was born, she now finds fruit and vegetables available in Gaza’s markets with the ceasefire. When we handed her a banana, she didn’t know what to do with it and tried to eat it with the peel on. Then she tried an apple, and new words began slipping into her little food dictionary, as if each bite were opening a whole new world of life for her.In the Sabra neighbourhood where I live, neighbours are gradually returning, pitching tents on what were once homes. The streets are filled with tons of war remnants: unexploded hand grenades, or ones rigged to detonate if moved, half-burnt smoke bombs, explosives meant to demolish houses, mortar shells, aerial bombs and chemical residues left from partially burnt munitions.Dozens of children have been injured in the past two days from playing with or stumbling across these hazards. People return slowly, cautiously – but not everyone; the fear of Israel returning to the battlefield is present in every step. No one truly believes the annihilation has stopped, or that it has ended. The place is wrapped in denial and shock, as if memory can no longer hold all this pain. People need life, nothing more. Gaza, after all it has endured – pain, betrayal, neglect – deserves a real chance at living, a genuine one, not fragile ceasefires.In the same neighbourhood, armed groups that emerged during the war are multiplying. What is happening here is not the birth of a new order, but a vacuum filled with fear, opportunism and chaos. Local gangs are appearing in the shadows, armed and stripped of any moral restraint, and many believe they are not spontaneous forces, but tools exploited, or quietly tolerated, by Israel. This phenomenon does not aim only at control, but at dismantling Gaza’s social fabric after its buildings have been torn apart, leaving residents in a constant state of fear and uncertainty, where every step toward life feels fraught with danger.The annihilation may end, but the occupation continues as it did before 7 October 2023. The blockade remains, settlements expand and daily oppression persists. We return to our daily losses on the news, but in quieter, lower tones, as the poet and author Mahmoud Darwishsaid: “Our losses: from two martyrs up to eight, every single day, 10 wounded, 20 homes, 50 olive trees, in addition to the structural damage that will strike the poem, the play, and the unfinished painting.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This nation of nature lovers won’t stand for itThu 16 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 13.41 EDTShareCrucial to the government’s war on nature is the “cauldron principle”. If a species is to be blamed for “holding up development”, it must be one you might find in a witch’s cauldron. The culprits are never dormice, otters, water voles, nightingales, turtle doves or orchids, widely considered cute or beautiful. They are bats, newts, snails and spiders.Bats andnewts have been blamedbysuccessive governmentsfor nastily “standing in the way” of growth. In March, Keir Starmer claimed that “jumping spiders” had stopped “an entire new town”. He added: “I’ve not made that example up.” I think you can guess what comes next.The jumping spiders are among 200 rare invertebrate species living on theSwanscombe peninsulain Kent, officially protected for nature. It also harbours marsh harriers,bearded titsand several scarce plant species. It’s of tremendous importance to local people as a crucial green space. The nature reserve has done nothing to stopEbbsfleet Garden Cityfrom going ahead. What developers were seeking to build on the peninsula was not homes, but atheme park. Boris Johnson’s government, hardly a staunch defender of nature against developers, declared the peninsula asite of special scientific interest, for its wide range of plants, geological features, birds and invertebrates. But Starmer, making it up as he goes along, has reduced the issue to spiders v people.Last week, the Guardian revealed that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, boasted to corporate executives that she has “unblocked” a large housing development in Sussex being held up by “some snails … a protected species or something … microscopic snails that you cannot even see”. This bring us to another principle: as the war on nature proceeds, ministers sound evermore like Donald Trump. The very rare little whirlpool ramshorn snail, by no means microscopic, is an indicator of fresh water not affected by sewage pollution: now a scarce habitat in England.Reeves went on to say: “We’ve got a good relationship with the developer and he brought it to our attention.” What is this relationship? I asked the Treasury, but it pointedly failed to answer the question. What the issue in Sussex is about is excessive water abstraction. The regulator, Natural England, warned that demand from the new development could cut off the water that keeps crucial andhighly protected wetlandsalive. Collapsing groundwater supplies also severely threaten human wellbeing in south-east England. It proposed thatconditions should be metfor the development to go ahead. Reeves appears to have swept the conditions away. But that doesn’t sound like such a noble cause as stomping on snails for the sake of people, does it?Ignorance and philistinism rule. By mentioning only the cauldron species, ministers hope to distance us from nature on behalf of property companies. Like Trump, they don’t even try to disguise their loyalties. Reeves boasted that shehatched the planto rip down our nature protections over a “smoked salmon and scrambled eggs breakfast” with corporate lobbyists. Starmer told us that his resolve to kick down the planning rules is the result of his “conversations with leading CEOs”.View image in fullscreenThe rare little whirlpool ramshorn snail.Photograph: Nature Photographers Ltd/AlamyTheplanning and infrastructure billbeing rammed through parliament is a full-spectrum assault on nature protection, theworst in Englandin living memory. It was rushed out, without consultation or evidence, under an “urgent measures” procedure, a device usually reserved for a defence or public health emergency. In other words, the government has used another Trumpian gambit to get its way: emergency powers.The bill will enable developers to bulldoze precious wild places, as long as they pay into a fund that may create alternative habitats or green spaces somewhere else. Irreplaceble ecosystems will be sold for cash. This outrageous measure is even worse than it first appears: a closer reading of the bill shows that themoney could be divertedinto any form of government spending, from prisons to debt repayments. Alternatively, the payments could be used by Natural England to fund its administration and operations. You don’t need to be clairvoyant to see how that develops: as its funding is steadily privatised, the regulator comes to depend on developers for its survival.And it gets worse still. Clause 90 enables governments to use “Henry VIII powers” to change any act or law to meet the objectives of the bill without full parliamentary debate: another “emergency” measure that could threaten any remaining protections. Reform UK must be licking its lips.So why isn’t the country in uproar? Because the big nature groups – the RSPB, the National Trust and the Wildlife Trusts – with their combined membership of 7.5 million, are mute. They accepted a series ofgovernment amendmentsin return for agreeing not to campaign against the bill. They were well and truly conned:they thoughtthe amendments met their demands, but theydid no such thing. Now the government has published a truly horrifying set ofnew amendmentsto the bill, tearing down even more protections. Still, astonishingly, the big groups fail to stir: a striking contrast to the way they responded when Johnson and Liz Truss attempted similar assaults on nature. As Alexa Culver, a planning lawyer at RSK Wilding, and now the leading expert on the bill, remarks, “It’s an extraordinary capitulation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because the rushed bill is such an ill-considered mess, the government is nowproposing another one. If it goes ahead, it willsweep away our rightsunder the Aarhus convention to challenge destructive developments, without losing our homes to legal bills.England urgently needs new homes. But we also need to defend and enhance our remaining ecosystems, and ensure everyone has access to green space, crucial to our physical and mental health. That’s what the planning system is for: to reconcile the need for development with other public needs. But if you listen only to “leading CEOs”, you ensure the country becomes hospitable to capital but inhospitable to wildlife and people.If you expect voters to thank you for that, you’re in for a shock. We are anation of nature lovers. If and when the conservation groups at last wake up, we will defend our green spaces and treasured species, cauldron or otherwise, as staunchly as we defend the right of everyone to be well housed.

Which is why it is time to push backWed 15 Oct 2025 23.20 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 09.18 EDTShareBad news, baby. The New Yorker reports the rapid advance of AI in the workplace will create a “permanent underclass” of everyone not already hitched to the AI train.The prediction comes fromOpenAIemployee Leopold Aschenbrenner, who claims AI will “reach or exceed human capacity” by 2027. Once it develops capacity to innovate, AI superintelligence will supersede even a need for its own programmers … and then wipe out the jobs done by everyone else.Nate Soares, winner of “most sunshine in book title” and co-author of AI critique If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies suggests “people should not be banking on work in the long term”. Math tutors, cinematographers, brand strategists and journalists are quoted by the New Yorker, freaking out.The consolation here is that if you are among those panicking about being forced into the permanent underclass, you are already in it.Inherited wealth makes more billionaires than entrepreneurship, the opportunity gap is growing; if your family don’t have the readies to fund yourtech startup,media empireor eventualpresidential ambitions, it’s probably because they were in a tech-displaced underclass, too.My own family were agrarian stablehands before industrialisation drove them to work in the Glasgow shipyards. After industrial decline there, they migrated south into retail clerkery. My dad worked in betting shops that have been replaced by apps. My mum was an admin assistant whose tasks you can now run from an iPhone.In a world where techlords rule us by whim, Australia’s stance against deepfakes is reason to celebrate | Van BadhamRead moreSo if this column is replaced by the burps of a machine programmed to deliver cultural trend-based leftist snark, I’ll be following family tradition. Spinning jennies, combine harvesters, electrification, trains, cars, recording, computers and, presumably, the wheel – given visible lack of sedan chairs – have all devastated industries and with them, people.How well we cope with that devastation is the opportunity of the hour, and you don’t need a machine to conclude unionisation is the remedy.Pals, we’ve been here before.When automation hit the Japanese carmaking industry in the 1970s, its unions successfully fought for “cooperative modernisation”, with job security guarantees and lifelong retraining programs.With technological progress replacing many of their functions, throughout the 1980s Australian nurses fought attacks to reduce their status and instead bargained to enhance their productivitythrough tertiary training with the new technologies– a victory that improved both their work conditions and professional standing.We are already seeing industrial unionstake the fight to AI. TheWriters Guild of Americastrike in 2023 resulted in an agreement that determined writers wouldn’t be replaced by generative AI as source material, or be compelled to use it – but would be at liberty to use AI as a productivity tool at their own writerly discretion, compliant with company policies.The opportunity to stand up for our AI-threatened livelihoods is now, because – despite the relentless insistence of tech’s grifters, zealots and cheerleaders – AI is not industrially inevitable. At present, it’s not even sustainable.While AIdata centre construction skyrockets, there are costs emerging even beyond the energy and water required to power and maintain them. Harris “Kuppy” Kupperman from hedge fund Praetorian Capital calculates the physical depreciation of these centres may be as rapid as three years. “No one understands,” was the quote collected byFuturism, “how the financial math is supposed to work.”Not investors, with the majority of responders to a Bank of America survey admitting concern thatAI stocks were in a bubble. Notthe Bank of England, who’ve warned of a potential “sudden correction” in worldwide markets as it raised concerns about the soaring company valuations.Not MIT, whose own maths have revealed that 95% of corporate clients trialling AI pilots or initiatives find zero – or negligible – return, or Carnegie Mellon University, whoreleased a papershowing AI agents failed to completebasic office tasksabout 70% of the time. Not TechRepublic, reporting that55% of surveyed companies that sacked workers to replace them with automation now regret the decision. Analytics firm Orgvue also found thatlayoffs cost the companies $1.27 for every $1 saved by the sacking.The Guardian view on an AI bubble: capitalism still hasn’t evolved to protect itself | EditorialRead moreIt sure makes the claim by professional tech patsyNick Cleggthat paying copyright on AI’s stolen content through a model such as a local library can manage would “basically kill” the industry revealing.Not paying for a product you exploit to sell your product is theft; not paying for labour you employ is slavery. If your business model is theft and slavery, you’re not an industry. You’re a pirate. Perhaps this is techno-cynicism. Or perhaps, this week, OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, announced a ChatGPT upgradewith tits. Ahoy! It’s some comfort that those who would casually erase our jobs at least cater to our entertainment.For my amusement, I used AI to create and automate a “techbro bot” that generates social media posts as a techlord, informed by a dataset of public statements by same.My AI couldn’t quite manage the code, so I had to recruit a professional, but I stare at its vapid, techo-capitalist self-hype on the hour, and I marvel how indistinguishable, digitisable – and replaceable – the makers of this bubble really are.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)Technology sectorOpenAISam AltmanChatGPTcommentShareReuse this content"

This policy leap could trigger the rapid shift we needWed 15 Oct 2025 21.08 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 01.11 EDTShareAustralia’s sluggishelectric vehicle transitionhas begun to accelerate. In the first half of the yearmore than 72,000battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles were sold. That’s about 12% of all new cars, upalmost a quarterover the same period in 2024.Despite this momentum, progress is still too slow. EVs now dominate in countries including Norway (98.3%of new cars), Nepal (76%) and China (51%). Australia is lagging.If nothing is done, transport isprojected to beAustralia’s largest emissions source by 2030. Cutting emissions 62% to 70% by 2035 under the government’snew targetwill requirerapidly shiftingfrom combustion engine vehicles to EVs.This week the Electric Vehicle Councilcalled foran end to the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035 to speed up the shift. Setting a sunset date wouldalign Australiawith major trading partners.Despite the risk of pushback, a phase-out deserves serious public debate. Letting the market decide is leading to a slow transition. This policy leap could trigger the rapid shift we need.Why is a phase-out needed?At present, transport accounts for 22% of Australia’s total emissions. It’s also thefastest-growing source.EVs will be essential in cutting these emissions. Australia has to reach an EV market share for new cars ofat least 50%in the next decade to achieve its broader 2035 emissions target.Without tougher measures and a firm phase-out, that looks unlikely. The taskis sizeable. Despite growing momentum, EVs only make upabout 2%of the21.7m carson the road today.Several countrieshave already committed to banning or phasing out new petrol, gas or diesel cars.The UKhas mandated80% of new cars and 70% of vans be zero-emission by 2030 and 100% by 2035.Safeguards are essentialThe tussle over the EU’s legislated ban is worth examining.All cars and vans sold after 2035 in the EU arelegally requiredto produce zero emissions – other than an exemption for vehicles running under strict conditions on synthetic e-fuels made from captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen.Are we there yet? Everything you need to know about the electric vehicle revolution in AustraliaRead moreIt wasn’t easy to get these laws through. The bloc’s top car-making nation, Germany, threatened toblock the lawsunless e-fuels were allowed. The EU was forced to negotiatea compromiseopening aloopholefor combustion engines to persist under the guise of “climate-neutral fuel”.Even so, the EU’s hard-fought ban remains one of the world’s strongest measures to phase out fossil-fuel vehicles. Mostmajor carmakerssupport the ban and automakers such asVolkswagenhave already announced plans to end new petrol and diesel car sales well before 2035. Mercedes hasbeen the most vocalin opposing the ban.The mistake Brussels policymakers made was to move to ban fossil fuel cars without laying out clear transition pathways. When bans like this are proposed, powerful interests invested in the status quo will look for ways to weaken them.Ensuring these phase-outs work depends on preventing backsliding through safeguards such as clear interim targets to track progress, flexible review mechanisms, protections against loopholes, and support for equity and infrastructure.Politics and industry pressureAny move to ban or restrict a product will meet resistance. When the federal government rolled out itsnew vehicle efficiency standard, it metstrong pushback– even though the standards haveno binding sales targets or bansbut ratherset targetsfor exhaust emissions from new vehicles.The federal ministerChris Bowenhas repeatedlyemphasisedthat the transition must rely on levers such as efficiency standards, incentives and infrastructure rather than bans.Bowenhas statedAustralia “cannot wish away fossil fuels” anddismissed earlier proposalsto ban new combustion engine vehicles. His consistent opposition suggests he views bans as politically risky.Any such ban would probably be seized on bythe oppositionand even government MPs in car-dependent regional and outer metropolitan areas.Car dealers and industry lobby groups focused on legacy combustion engine cars are likely tooppose any legislationspeeding up the shift to EVs. But EV makers and charging companies would hail the ban.Rising EV sales show the community is increasingly supportive. But affordability, range of models and charger reliability remain concerns.How to build a banAny such ban in Australia would have to be legislated or regulated, not aspirational. It would have to come with robust targets for EV uptake and infrastructure expansion offering certainty to manufacturers and markets.It would have to be paired with steadily tightening fuel-efficiency standards and incentives, as well asfair road pricingandregistration reformsto ensure equity.EV drivers set to pay road user charges as record number of electric cars selling in AustraliaRead moreThe charging infrastructure rollout would have to be scaled up aggressively and with particular focus on filling in gaps in rural, regional and remote areas.Any ban would have to be equitable. This would mean extra support for lower-income and rural households, pragmatic trade-in schemes, and measures to preserve used-vehicle markets so people who can’t yet afford new EVs still have access to affordable transport.Importantly, the policy must guard against backsliding by limiting loopholes, undertaking regular reviews and building in transparency mechanisms.The car industry will need transition support such as workforce reskilling and incentives for local manufacturing to support the EV industry.Any ban should be part of awider strategyfocused on endingsubsidies and incentivesfor fossil fuel vehicles and potentially creating a cost-neutral“feebate” scheme, where levies on buyers of new high-emissions vehicles are used to offer rebates for zero or low-emission vehicles to offset higher prices.Examples include France’sBonus-Malusand New Zealand’sClean Car Discount.A question of resolveBanning petrol cars by 2035 isn’t radical – it’s necessary. Voluntary transitions and market forces will be too slow.Opponents will frame any ban as coercive and unfair. Europe’s experience suggests powerful interest groups will seek to delay or weaken any ban.A phase-out date cannot be a slogan – it must give certainty and set the direction for the entire transport system.For car-dependent Australia, a 2035 ban may sound like a tough ask. But without it, transport risks becoming an albatross around our necks. The question now is whether Australia has the discipline to match the ambition.Hussein Dia is a professor of transport technology and sustainability at Swinburne University of Technology.

How did you write it?EamonmccI was still learning about songwriting and by the time I got to Something/Anything? [1972, featuring I Saw the Light] I was slipping into formula – verse, chorus, bridge and so on, always about the girl or boy who broke your heart. I moved my hands about the keyboard and 20 minutes later that song was done. It’s partly why I went completely off the grid for my next album, A Wizard, a True Star [1973] – because I realised I couldn’t keep cranking out songs in 20 minutes about that one relationship in high school. The prettiest girl in school had suddenly taken a shine to me – I think because I had long hair, which was also the reason her dad made her break up with me, which messed me up pretty bad.Wikipedia says A Wizard,a True Star was “heavily informed by Rundgren’s hallucinogenic experiences”. Were you actually taking LSD?mjhmjhI didn’t smoke or drink anything until my first album [Runt, in 1970]. In my first band they’d smoke pot and the rehearsal would turn into a 30-minute giggling session. Then, when I was 21 I was living in [rhythm section] the Sales brothers’ house and their mom said “I can’t believe you’ve never had a drink” and got me drunk. Then my best friend who was studying to be a psychiatrist suggested I try psychoactives. I trusted him implicitly, so I did. I was taking drugs occasionally throughout the building of the studio. Not when we were doing the music – I had to run the sessions – but I remember lying on my back as high as a kite trying to do the wiring. Through psychoactives I discovered there was more going on in my head than that high school relationship.In your bookThe Individualistyou said thatwhen you were travelling aroundyou wrote a song but didn’t have a recorder, so kept replaying it in your head until you got back to the States. Which song was it?JanetDMI believe it was Lost Horizon. I was in a little hotel room in Kathmandu and a song started going round in my head. The only way I could remember it was to visualise a piano keyboard and practise the piano part on the imaginary keyboard, so when I got back I was able to play it. You never know when a song will hit you. I once woke up in the middle of the night with Bang the Drum All Day in my head. It wasn’t a song I’d normally have written, but I’ve realised that my subconscious doesn’t stop when I go to sleep.Did Levon Helm really chase you around the studio when the Band were makingStage Fright?tomcasagrandaThere may have been an episode. It was my first major project as an engineer and I was a smart-ass kid, like calling Garth [Hudson] “old man” thinking he was too old to stay awake, not realising he had narcolepsy. I wasn’t into that kind of music and not cognitive of the fact the Band were one of the biggest acts in the world. They suddenly had all the money, drugs, drink and sycophants available to them and it affected some of the guys. Levon got into opiates so while he may have chased me round the studio he spent as much time underneath a pile of curtains, dead to the world. In later years they all became my friends … except Robbie [Robertson], who was kind of a snob.When you produced Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell, did [composer] Jim Steinman mean it, or was it a parody of the ever earnest Bruce Springsteen?roxusrollusSteinman never admitted what a Springsteen fan he was, even though he took me to see him, but from my point of view it was a parody. Everyone they’d played stuff to had said the songs were too long and Meat Loaf was too weird, but I heard it in the context of Springsteen’s leather jackets/50s thing – but not a handsome guy from New Jersey, a big sweaty guy. It’s not that well known that Steinman had a keen sense of humour, so even in the most sincere moments Steinman is taking it purposely over the top. That album unleashed a force upon the world – the brand of excess. After that everything Steinman did was excessive.View image in fullscreenWith Meat Loaf during Musicourt ‘82 at Forest Hills in New York City.Photograph: Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty ImagesWhat wasLaura Nyrolike when you worked together – and why do you think she’s not held up alongside the likes of Joni Mitchell and Carole King?laurasnapesI met her just after Eli and the Thirteenth Confession [1968] and was in awe of her. She asked me to be her bandleader but I was busy with my own band, the Nazz. Over a decade later she’d built a house with a studio but couldn’t get an album started so called me in desperation. We worked on each song until she was satisfied, but I became uncomfortable because she had a girlfriend there offering opinions which meant more than mine. I withdrew, but she did finish the record [Mother’s Spiritual, 1984]. Her music was remarkably sophisticated and passionate, completely individual, but audiences don’t really want people who sound completely different to everybody else. Some artists exist to influence other artists, to go where others won’t and show them how.Todd Rundgren: ‘It’s hard to find sincerely musical artists nowadays. The music is just mediocre’Read moreYourDIY approach to recording albums was apparently a huge influence on Prince, andBebe Buellhas spoken of a young and star-struck Prince Rogers Nelsonwaiting to meet you backstage at a show. Do you have any recollection of this?TheManWithoutFearNo recollection whatsoever, which isn’t to say it didn’t happen. Prince took the play-every-instrument thing to another level. I wanted to write beyond what I could play and realised there are better players, whereas he tailored the songs to his capabilities as a player. So the drums are simple, certainly not like Stevie Wonder’s, who was a crazily funky drummer. I thought some of Prince’s stuff was great but some of the lyrics made no sense to me at all. I don’t know what the hell Purple Rain is. Is it some kind of pollution?View image in fullscreenRundgren poses for a portrait in Los Angeles, California, circa 1977.Photograph: Aaron Rapoport/Getty ImagesDid you keep the amusing letters that John Lennonsent you?kaipaheadI met him at a party in the period he was drinking with Harry Nilsson and misbehaving all over Hollywood. He looked like a bundle of rags in the corner and as a Beatles fan I was disappointed that he had nothing to say. Later I was being interviewed by NME and I said something along the lines of that you can’t be a revolutionary and preach one thing if you’re behaving in another way, and that became the headline. John wrote a letter ostensibly to me but as an open letter in NME. There was a kerfuffle. Then one day I got a call and it was John, saying: “I think we’re being used here, so let’s bury the hatchet.” I said: “Fine” and that was that.What do you think of theXTC album Skylarking, 39 yearsafter you produced it? Is it hard to divorce the record from the notoriously fraught recording sessions?Angrysince1967I don’t think Andy [Partridge] ever wanted a producer. He’d already steamrollered over the likes of Steve Lillywhite and Gus Dudgeon. When I did Skylarking, Gus sent me a letter of condolence. Everything came to a head when we recorded Earn Enough for Us, the only song on the entire album where they played together. It was great, but the next day Andy made Colin [Moulding] punch in every note of the bass part. I said “Oh God, for once you did something like XTC the band …” and Andy flipped out. I told him “I’m just trying to make the best record I can for you guys”, and he said “Then why do I feel like cleaving your head in with an axe?” Andy told anyone that would listen that it was the worst record they ever made, but I heard he has since confessed it’s one of their best.View image in fullscreenRundgren performs on the Midnight Special.Photograph: NBC/Universal/Getty ImagesWhen you produced theNew York Dolls’ debut did you realisethe record would prove so divisive – a well-known UK television presenter called them “mock rock”?willcantopherI don’t think that was inaccurate. Most people categorise them as punk rock simply because John Lydon cited them as the principle influence on the Sex Pistols. Technically the New York Dolls wanted to be the Rolling Stones: that album cover is straight from the Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? era. The more cynical rock critics like Lester Bangs liked them because it was the kind of music a rock critic could play – three chords. Even though the Dolls were New York celebrities in Max’s Kansas City every night they all lived out on Long Island, some of ’em with their moms.To say you’re prolific would be an understatement. I particularly like Liars, State and White Knight of your most recent catalogue. How do you rate these albums in your body of work?MonsieurMadeleineWith Liars I was getting my sea legs after the transition from the traditional record company model to the internet thing. State was essentially me trying to get up to date with techniques I’d kinda pioneered in the 70s but another generation had taken over, like electronic and drum’n’bass. White Knight was my first serious collaborative record, so I wasn’t continually stewing in my own juices. For my last album, Space, I got people to give me demos of songs they’d never finished, and we’d finish them together. I am working on a new record, which I’ll finish after the next touring leg, but playing live keeps me youthful. My body likes me to get out there for two and a half hours each night. It’s like an aerobic exercise, or a marathon.Todd Rundgrenplays Subscription Rooms, Stroud (26 October), Alexandra theatre, Birmingham (28) and London Palladium (29).Explore more on these topicsTodd RundgrenFilm & Music reader interviewPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It felt like a classic album, one that will take pride of place in record collections for years to come.”Fender, 31, grew up in North Shields, close to where the award ceremony was held this year, inNewcastle.He broke through quickly with his debut album Hypersonic Missiles in 2019, which topped the UK album chart, then consolidated its epic yet poignant sound on second album Seventeen Going Under (2021), and again with People Watching, released in February.It has taken him to even greater commercial heights, producing two Top 10 singles and prompting a series of stadium concerts.Accepting the award to the sound of Newcastle United chants in the crowd, Fender said: “We did not expect this at all … I want to say thank you, because I never did, to the person the song People Watching is about: Annie Orwin, who’s up there.”Fender has previously described Orwin, an actor, as “like a surrogate mother” to him, and the lyrics of the song People Watching reflect on his visits to see her in the care home where she eventually died in 2023. He performed the song at the ceremony.This year’s Mercury prize shortlist featured a number of commercially successful albums alongside somewhat lesser-known names.People Watching, Wolf Alice’s The Clearing and Pulp’s comeback album More all topped the UK album chart, while CMAT’s Euro-Country, FKA twigs’ Eusexua, Fontaines DC’s Romance and PinkPantheress’s Fancy That all reached the Top 3. Bookmakers had CMAT as the favourite, followed byFontaines DCand Pulp.Also nominated were Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon, rapper Pa Salieu, jazz-funk artist Emma-Jean Thackray, and Welsh jazz pianist Joe Webb.View image in fullscreenMartin Carthy on the Mercury prize’s red carpet.Photograph: JMEnternational/Getty ImagesThe prize also had its oldest ever nominee: English folk singerMartin Carthy, 84, recognised for his album Transform Me Then Into a Fish.Carthy’s career stretches back to the early 1960s London, where he influenced Bob Dylan, teaching him the standard Scarborough Fair. He later made recordings with his wife, Norma Waterson, and their daughter Eliza Carthy followed them into folk music, earning two Mercury prize nominations of her own in 1998 and 2003.Martin and Eliza performed a version of Scarborough Fair together, with sitar player Sheema Mukherjee, at the ceremony. Alon, Fender,FKA twigs, Pulp, Salieu, Thackray, Webb and Wolf Alice each also performed a song live.CMAT was also in attendance, but did not perform due to recent treatment to two wisdom teeth. “I was thinking about making jewellery from them,” she told BBC 6 Music. “I want to make the other nominees kiss my teeth for good luck, but not tell them it’s my good luck.”Wolf Alice became the first act to be nominated for each of their first four albums. Both they andPulphave one win from four nominations.In 2024, the Mercury prize seemed to be in a somewhat parlous state, after it failed to secure an event sponsor and had to make do with a scaled-back awards show without live performances.But it has returned strongly in 2025, relocating to Newcastle and using the city’s Utilita Arena as a venue. It also hosted an array of “Mercury fringe” events in the days prior to the award ceremony, with artist showcases, workshops and panel discussions.Guardian analysisof recent winners found that between 2014 and 2023, every winner hailed from London, with Leeds band English Teacher finally bringing a win from outside the capital in 2024.The move to Newcastle, which helps to counter a generally London-centric music industry, has therefore been praised. Ian Murray, minister for creative industries, media and arts, said the “symbolic step” was “hugely welcome … for too long other regions have had to play second fiddle to London, despite having world-class creative output in their own right”.View image in fullscreenSam Fender and band celebrate their win.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThe Mercury prize is voted for by a team of music industry figures: jazz musician and broadcaster Jamie Cullum; radio DJs Sian Eleri, Jamz Supernova, Mistajam, and Danielle Perry; journalists Phil Alexander, Will Hodgkinson and Sophie Williams; music consultant Lea Stonhill; and the chair of the judges, Jeff Smith, head of music at BBC Radio 2 and Radio 6 Music.The prize, founded in 1992, is described as a “celebration of the 12 albums of the year, recognising artistic achievement across a range of contemporary music genres”. The most nominated artists are Radiohead and Arctic Monkeys, each with five, while PJ Harvey is the only artist to have won it twice.Fender wins £25,000 prize money. The judges’ statement added that People Watching is “melody-rich and expansive, marrying heartland rock with the realities of everyday life and the importance of community. These are thoughtful songs with broad appeal, as cinematic as they are intimate.”Explore more on these topicsMercury prizeAwards and prizesSam FenderPulpCMATFontaines DCFKA twigsnewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Studiocanal/AllstarAs Manchester’s finest turns 60, withnew film Saipancoming soon, we rank the British comedy hero’s best big-screen performances, from Tropic Thunder and Mindhorn to Philomena and Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa. A-Ha!ByChris TryhornThu 16 Oct 2025 08.46 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 10.29 EDTShare20.The Wind in the Willows(1996)Steve Coogan entered the unofficial British comedy hall of fame at the tender age of 30, when he joined four of the Pythons and the likes of Stephen Fry and Victoria Wood in this largely forgotten version of the classic children’s tale. Bedecked in a long scarf and wearing rimless specs, he puts in a respectably twitchy turn as Mole alongside Eric Idle’s Rat and Terry Jones’s Toad.19.Night at the Museum films(2006-2014)In the comedy franchise about museum exhibits coming to life at night, Coogan plays Octavius, a miniature Roman general. Although it is, quite literally, a small part, Coogan makes the most of sharing the screen with Robin Williams, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson – “We may be small, but our hearts are large … metaphorically speaking!” he bellows at Stiller’s security guard.View image in fullscreenAs Octavius, with Owen Wilson’s Jedediah, in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Allstar18.Hamlet 2(2008)Sold for $10m at Sundance, this quirky high-school comedy in the tradition of Rushmore and Election was tipped to be the vehicle that would crack America for Coogan. Instead, it flopped badly and went straight to DVD in the UK. It’s not hard to see why: it’s a bizarre, misfiring story of a drama teacher with daddy issues who stages an ill-advised sequel to Hamlet. Coogan throws everything at it and squeezes out some laughs – the highlight being the Rock Me, Sexy Jesus song in which he prances about in a vest – but he just can’t make it all come together.17.Tropic Thunder(2008)Released in the same month as Hamlet 2, Ben Stiller’s ambitious but exhausting satire put Coogan alongside some bona fide Hollywood heavyweights: Stiller himself, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black and even Tom Cruise. As Damien Cockburn, the floundering British director of an over-budget Vietnam war movie, Coogan seems out of place in this bombastic, largely unfunny film, with his character making an explosive early exit.16.The Penguin Lessons(2024)Based on the memoir by Tom Michell (wholast week deniedhistoric sexual abuse allegations), this eccentric drama sees Coogan embracing late middle age as a depressed school teacher who rescues a penguin during the dark days of Argentina’s military dictatorship. His sombre, dignified performance saves this jarringly sentimental film, scripted by regular collaborator Jeff Pope, from cloying too badly.View image in fullscreenCoogan in The Penguin Lessons.Photograph: Sony Pictures/Everett/Shutterstock15.The Parole Officer(2001)Coogan oncesaid in an interview withthe Guardian that just thinking about this ludicrous Ealing-style caper makes him “squirm”. It certainly wasn’t a worthy vehicle for a TV comedian at the height of his powers, but it’s still quite a fun way to spend 90 minutes. Coogan’s poorly conceived character is a big part of the problem: he’s a mild-mannered, liberal probation officer who somehow organises a bank heist to expose a bent copper.14.Marie Antoinette(2006)Securing the prestigious “and” billing in the credits, Coogan plays the Austrian ambassador to the French court in Sofia Coppola’s divisive period drama. He doesn’t have much to do but advise the young queen (Kirsten Dunst) to hurry up and get pregnant, but he shows he can handle a fully straight role – his first on film – without ironising the dialogue or indulging in Partridgean mannerisms.13.Mindhorn(2016)In a sparkling cameo, Coogan dons tinted glasses and an ear stud as Pete Easterman, an arrogant TV actor who has had spin-off success as The Windjammer, while the career of one-time star Richard Thorncroft (Julian Barratt) has hit the skids. Receiving Thorncroft at his Isle of Man country club, Easterman spurns his proposal for a DVD release, reminding him, “You called me a stinking ham on Wogan, with the emotional range of a chair leg.”View image in fullscreenAs Pete Easterman in Mindhorn.Photograph: Netflix12.Northern Soul(2014)Alongside fellow northern luminaries Ricky Tomlinson, Lisa Stansfield and his old comedy partner John Thomson, Coogan lends his star power to this splendidly realised evocation of the Northern Soul dance movement in 1970s Lancashire. He plays the kind of teacher happy to write off his students as “mallet heads” and humiliate a boy by reading out the lyrics he has jotted down in a notebook (“Bloody hell, it’s a poem … that’s bobbins, that is”).11.Ruby Sparks(2012)Kicking off a superb run of films in 2012 and 2013, Coogan has a minor part in this clever fantasy about a writer (Paul Dano) who somehow brings a young woman (Zoe Kazan) into existence through his typewriter. Coogan joins an alpha supporting cast featuring Elliott Gould, Annette Bening and Antonio Banderas and impresses with his devilish turn as the sleazy, cynical author Langdon Tharp.10.Greed(2019)The muzzling of Michael Winterbottom: how Sony censored GreedRead moreCoogan plays the vulgar, bullying retail mogul Sir Richard McCreadie – all perma-tan and distractingly expensive teeth – in this heavy-handed but often hilarious satire. If only directorMichael Winterbottomhad stretched Coogan more and delved deeper into McCreadie’s curious relationships with his mother (Shirley Henderson) and ex-wife (Isla Fisher) rather than making predictable points about the iniquities of capitalism and the plight of garment workers and refugees.9.In the Loop(2009)In Armando Iannucci’s political satire, Coogan plays an irate constituent complaining to hapless minister Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) about a collapsing wall. The whiff of danger is essential to the character – at one point he roars, “I’m not going to let a bomb off, I work for the National Trust!”– but takes on a disturbing complexion today after the murders of MPs Jo Cox and David Amess.8.The Look of Love(2013)Coogan gives a nuanced, if oddly downbeat portrayal of Paul Raymond, the Soho strip club and porn tycoon who was once Britain’s richest man, in this entertaining but shallow film from Winterbottom that doesn’t quite make sense of Raymond’s multifaceted character: a highly driven, unconventional businessman, with a voracious appetite for sex, drink and drugs, who doted on his daughter (Imogen Poots) and was devastated by her death.The Look of Love: Steve Coogan and Michael Winterbottom on their biopic of Paul RaymondGuardian7.Stan & Ollie(2018)Coogan pays tribute to another comic son of the north-west, Stan Laurel, in this gentle portrait of Laurel and Oliver Hardy in the twilight of their careers. Coogan and co-star John C Reilly look the part and handle the physical comedy in various theatrical routines with a deft grace, but the film’s attempt to derive pathos from their fading legends falls a little flat.View image in fullscreenCoogan and John C Reilly in Stan & Ollie.Photograph: BBB Films/Allstar6.Coffee and Cigarettes(2003)In Jim Jarmusch’s anthology of vignettes, Coogan plays himself on screen for the first time and clearly relishes toying with assumptions about his personality and his ambitions to make it in Hollywood. Over the course of a deliciously poised 17-minute scene, he’s not afraid to come across as a libidinous, status-obsessed slimeball as he tries to brush off Alfred Molina’s screenplay proposal – and then comes to regret it.5.What Maisie Knew(2012)Coogan shines opposite Julianne Moore in this keenly observed modern-day adaptation of a Henry James novel about self-absorbed parents battling over their six-year-old daughter as their relationship falls apart. Deploying just the right kind of transatlantic accent, he plays oleaginous art dealer Beale, a man who whisks his daughter out of school early while on a work call and suggests going for “a double espresso”.4.A Cock and Bull Story(2005)In Michael Winterbottom’s suitably meta take on Laurence Sterne’s proto-postmodern work Tristram Shandy, Coogan plays himself working on a film of the novel, in which he is playing Shandy and the character’s father, Walter. We see him negotiating his way through an extramarital entanglement, dealing with an obnoxious tabloid reporter and sparring with co-star Rob Brydon. Their testy banter on this very funny film paved the way for their brilliant self-imitation games on four series of The Trip (also directed by Winterbottom and edited for the US into feature-length film versions).3.Philomena(2013)Steve Coogan and Martin Sixsmith on Philomena: ‘It’s got humanity without irony’GuardianWith an Oscar-nominated screenplay by Coogan and Jeff Pope, this powerful drama was a landmark in Coogan’s acting career. In the script and his performance as journalist Martin Sixsmith, he is at pains to restrain his natural instinct for comedy, allowing Judi Dench to get all the best lines as an Irish woman searching for the child she was forced to give up for adoption. The odd-couple dynamic between Coogan and Dench generates thoughtful reflections on morality and culpability, as Sixsmith’s indignation at the Catholic church is outflanked by Philomena’s pragmatic faith.2.Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa(2013)Steve Coogan on Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa: ‘He’s crass, but there’s a small amount of nobility’GuardianCan I just shock you? I like Alpha Papa. The only feature film in the sprawling Alanverse, it isn’t universally loved by fans and there is something a little odd about seeing Coogan’s most enduring creation given the big screen treatment, with a hostage taking plot contrived to provide the necessary 90-minute story arc. But if it’s judged harshly by some, it can only be because it doesn’t hit the matchless heights of Knowing Me Knowing You and I’m Alan Partridge. There is so much comedy gold and “radio gravy” here, from Alan singing along toRoachford’s Cuddly Toy over the opening creditsto the standoff on Cromer pier at the end.View image in fullscreenCoogan as Tony Wilson in 24 Hour Party People.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy1.24 Hour Party People(2002)After the fumble of The Parole Officer, Coogan got things back on track in Winterbottom’s free-wheeling, fourth-wall-busting love letter to Manchester and its music scene, brilliantly scripted by Frank Cottrell-Boyce. Coogan was perfectly cast as Mancunian Renaissance man Tony Wilson – Granada presenter, Factory Records boss, Haçienda owner and Madchester ringmaster – and brings just the right kind of maverick intellectual energy to the part. His scintillating performance at the head of a supremely talented cast holds the film together and injects a romantic nobility into this scabrous tale.Explore more on these topicsRankedSteve CooganPhilomenaIn the LoopMichael WinterbottomAlan PartridgeStan & OlliefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will he leave wearing a suit of Greek armour?Eddy FrankelThu 16 Oct 2025 07.45 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 17.27 EDTShareOn the face of things, Frieze is pretty awful. It represents the art world at its most brazenly commercial, its most avaricious and capitalistic. This is the market laid bare, with all of its champagne, ludicrous outfits and obscene excess on brazen display for anyone willing to fork out a wodge on a ticket. That’s what reviews of Frieze generally complain about, all the greedy capitalistic knives being stabbed into the heart of their beloved, pure art.But Frieze, and the more refined Frieze Masters, isn’t really about art. Sure, this art fair in Regent’s Park, London, is the biggest art fair in the UK, attracting all the best galleries and artists in the world. But Frieze isn’t about painting and sculpture and conceptualism – it’s about selling. Going to Frieze is all about mindset. If you come here looking for innovation, emotion and aesthetic brilliance, you’re going to be let down. But if you come here to experience the art world – to watch deals get done, to see the market in full flight – it’s genuinely a huge amount of fun.View image in fullscreenMid-grimace … Glen Pudvine at Xxijra Hii gallery.Photograph: Glen PudivineBe warned: by attending Frieze you are inevitably going to see a gargantuan amount of utterly pointless, totally anonymous, immediately forgettable painting. Abstract, figurative, geometric, whatever you want, there is an endless amount of it here, because it sells, and almost all of it sucks. You will see ceramics that look as if they were made by four-year-olds. You will also see some of the absolute best facelifts money can buy. Some of the people here are pulled so taut they’d rip if they sneezed.The fair is vast, maybe even interminable. The key is to follow your instincts. Look at everything but only stop and consider the stuff that hits you immediately. That’s what Frieze is for – flexing your art muscles and going with your gut.The fair is divided into sections: Focus, Artist-to-Artist, various curated/themed areas, and then the main fair. Focus is the place for young galleries, and it’s invariably where you will find the most interesting, experimental art.It kicks off this year with London-based painter Glen Pudvine at Xxijra Hii gallery, who has filled his mirrored booth with huge, nude self-portraits, capturing himself in ludicrous mid-grimace doing a kettlebell workout. They are stunningly painted: he puts more effort into capturing the folds of a scrotum than most artists put into faces. They’re funny images, silly even, yet also brilliantly unique takedowns of fragile masculinity.If you’ve never found whales sexy before then Luís Lázaro Matos’s pastels should turn your head. They reimagine Benny the Beluga, a whale that got stranded in the Thames in 2018, as a Speedo-wearing Mediterranean party animal living it up as a literal fish out of water.

Ana Segovia was selected by Mexican conceptualist Abraham Cruzvillegas, and her closeup paintings of cowboys’ crotches are all denim, leather and rampant sensuality.In the main bit of the fair, Gagosian’s solo presentation by Lauren Halsey is a rare moment of bold joy in an otherwise fairly safe and dour bit of the tent. The LA artist has created huge cast plaster murals of everyday black life – kids, cars, games, barbershops, gyms – in a sort of ancient Egyptian take on American street culture. It buzzes with the life-force of south central LA.The fair is absolutely filled with artists ripping off Huma Bhabha’s post-nuclear, pock-marked, sci-fi take on sculpture – there seems to be one every 15 metres – and when you finally get to an original at the David Zwirner booth you realise how much better she is than her imitators. The bust on display here is classic Bhabha, all grim, apocalyptic grossness.View image in fullscreenLose your head … a work called El otro protagonista de la noche by Enrique Lopez Llamas at the Llano stand.Photograph: Henry Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesI’d happily take home at least one of the two Celia Paul portraits at Victoria Miro, and the huge John Baldessari at Sprüth Magers would no doubt look great above the sofa. The super gruesome, cartoony Peter Saul drawings at Michael Werner are stunning, as are the works on paper by Turner prize-nominated (and likely winner)Nnena Kalu.At Frieze Masters, 10 minutes north, the experience is totally different. Mainly dedicated to work from before the year 2000, it’s endlessly more refined, quiet and elegant than its brash counterpart. Want an ancient Roman bust? A suit of Greek armour? A Marc Chagall? A Marcel Duchamp? A giant triceratops skull?! This is where you’ll get it.Elsewhere on show: an elephantine Giorgio de Chirico, a glimmering deep sea blue Yves Klein on paper, some eye melting op art by Victor Vasarely and Yoshio Sekine, loads of amazing Dutch flower paintings and a jaw-dropping display of wispy, perfect ancient Roman glass.Is Frieze this year better than last year? Is it worse? Neither, really. Frieze is Frieze. It’s hectic, overwhelming, filled with way too much art and way too many rich people. It’s beautiful, stupid, pompous, ridiculous and absolutely exhausting – it’s the art world at its worst, but also at its best. Let’s hope it never changes.Frieze and Frieze Masters are atRegent’s Park, London, until 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFrieze art fairArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now Sarnatska, 38, has several dramas under her belt and is emerging as one of Ukraine’s most powerful voices in the theatre.It is a dizzying transformation for a person who, though she had loved writing when she was young, associated the word “playwright” with distant figures such as Shakespeare, rather than anyone like herself.She attributes the sheer speed of her emergence to the war. “I think Russians will kill me, maybe after two years, maybe after three years, by drones, rockets or in the street,” she said. “So I don’t have time. I need to do everything right now and right here.”View image in fullscreenMilitary Mama was one of 15 plays selected for a programme called Theatre of Veterans.Photograph: Oleg PalchykHer first performed play, Military Mama, was written as part of a programme calledTheatre of Veterans. The scheme, co-founded by the dramatist Maksym Kurochkin, who himself fought in the eastern region of Luhansk in 2022, aims to transform soldiers and veterans from theatre novices to performed playwrights – bringing their battlefield experiences to the stage.Sarnatska was one of 15 selected for the scheme after an open call. Military Mama was a standout script and was produced on one of Kyiv’s main stages at the Left Bank theatre.It tells the story of an ordinary woman’s experience in the army, tackling motherhood, sexism in the military, relationship breakdown, mental health problems and desertion – unheroic subjects that, while not exactly taboo in Ukrainian society, are largely absent from official narratives.Her frankness as a writer and refusal to adopt a simplistic, morale-boosting position does not always go down well. A performance this month in the frontline city of Dnipro of her prize-winning play Balance, about the often horrific experiences of a battlefield medic, was attended by priests and officials from the city council who then complained to the theatre.“After the performance, the director came out to apologise for the swearing and the realism,” she said. “But it didn’t help, and the theatre representatives were summoned to the city administration and scolded for the performance because it was sad, not heroic, and contained bad language.”But her plays are also welcomed by theatregoers for their brute honesty about the realities of the frontline. Some audience members were in tears after a performance of Military Mama this summer in Kyiv, and the cast took part in a post-show discussion. One woman, whose husband was at the front, and another audience member, the father of a veteran, thanked the actors for helping them understand something of life in the trenches.It is a play in which “all soldiers can recognise themselves because it’s about very ordinary military life”, said Sarnatska. But it does not hold back on its criticism of civilian characters, who go about their lives oblivious to the horrors their compatriots are living, or dying, through.In some after-show discussions audience members have asked whether she hates civilians, she said. “Every time I’m asked that I stay silent,” she said. Instead, she lets the more emollient director take the question.View image in fullscreenActors perform Penelope, based on women waiting for their loved ones to come home, at the Lesya Ukrainka theatre in Lviv.Photograph: Ertuğrul SevimA new play, Penelope, based on women waiting for their loved ones to come home from the war, premiered this summer at the Lesya Ukrainka theatre in Lviv.It is partly inspired by Penelope, Odysseus’s long-suffering wife, who, in Homer’s Odyssey, waits for him to return from the Trojan war for 20 years. Its cast of seven women, as well as its director, Svitlana Fedeshova, all have partners who are serving.“I could write some heroic story, saying everything is OK,” she said of the play. “But I don’t want a situation where a woman who is waiting for her husband comes to the theatre and sees some kind of fairytale telling her everything is OK, and then she leaves, and she still waiting. That’s what I want to avoid.”Sarnatska – who was a sex worker for several years, including while she was studying for a degree in psychology – was working with NGOs as a social worker before Russia’s full-scale invasion, supporting female victims of violence and those with substance addictions; and campaigning for sex workers’ rights.View image in fullscreenAlina Sarnatska, centre, during a minute’s silence in Kyiv.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianSince her departure from military service, she has been working on her PhD, organising protests to improve soldiers’ rights, and working with a support network for wounded soldiers and their families. She is now undertaking a writing residency in Germany, where she has been working on a novel.Before being accepted for theTheatreof Veterans programme, she said she knew nothing about theatre or dramatists. “I knew Shakespeare was a dramatist, and that’s all.”But she posted prolifically on social media during her time as a combat medic, often writing pithy and memorable dialogues as part of her fundraising efforts for her unit. It was because of those dialogues that a friend urged her to apply for Theatre of Veterans.That said, she is still not much of a theatre fan herself. “I hate theatre,” she said. “OK, by now I have seen some interesting things. But it’s not something to do in my free time.” Her writing god is, in fact, the novelist Stephen King. “If you write a good story, it will work on the stage,” she said.A further play, Menstruation, is due to premiere at the end of the year atMolodyy theatrein Kyiv. It is about the experiences of sex workers as the tide of the 2022 invasion crashed around them – stories that have rarely been aired publicly in Ukraine.She has recently completed a play called Fat, set in the present day and the 1930s, that connects disordered eating in modern Ukraine withthe Holodomor, the human-made famine in which up to 3 million people died in 1932-33 – a result of Stalin’s brutally enforced grain quotas.Explore more on these topicsTheatreUkraineEuropeWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This time around, it’s jumping from one season to the next after only five episodes (which, granted, have come in bi-monthly instalments, not counting the abrupt season finale that was pushed back a week due to a blown deadline).They’ve finally gone there: South Park lets rip at Benjamin NetanyahuRead moreTonight’s episode, titled Twisted Christian, kicks off season 28. At South Park Elementary, PC Principal – the PC standing for Power Christian ever since his politically motivated conversion at the start of last season – attempts to put a stop to his students’ obsession with the “6-7” TikTok meme, not because it is insufferable or disruptive, but because he considers it “some satanic numerology shit”. Rather than seeking help from the school’s new guidance counsellor, Jesus Christ, he turns to the world’s top expert on the antichrist:billionaire Peter Thiel. (The show’s caricature of Thiel – sunken skeletal visage with bulging bug eyes – is up there with Kristi Noem’s from earlier this year in terms of viciousness.)Thiel dives into the lore of the antichrist, revealing that God’s punishment of Satan after the war in heaven was to shrink his butthole down to the size of a pinhole, “so that [he] could never have a butt baby … until along came MrDonald Trump, whose penis is so teeny-teeny-tiny it could actually fit in Satan’s asshole.” The size of Trump’s penis? Somewhere between 6-7cm. All of this is foretold in Revelation 6:7, natch.We’re also shown a scheming JD Vance, who seems to be the one pulling the strings rather than Satan or Trump. He is doing everything in his power to stop the birth of his boss’s unholy spawn, including giving his benefactor Thiel unlimited access to every government database while also convincing Trump to seek out an abortion.Donald Trump takes a back seat to other characters here, although several scenes are dedicated to his nether regions (including a couple of attempts at masturbation with the help of a pair of tweezers), making this by far the most explicit and outrageous episode since the last season premiere.View image in fullscreen‘A full-blown case of demonic possession’ … Cartman in South Park season 28, episode one: Twisted Christian.Photograph: ParamountMeanwhile, back in South Park, Jesus suffers a crisis of faith after spending time with PC Principal and other Maga Christians (“You need a way to bully people and you’re using the Bible to do it!”), while Eric Cartman’s unhealthy obsession with the “6-7” meme turns into a full-blown case of demonic possession, replete with violent projectile vomiting a la The Exorcist. It turns out he may have the key to stopping the apocalypse. Jesus eventually gives in to peer pressure and embraces a Christian bro lifestyle, while Cartman heads to DC, where a face-to-face with Trump is all but inevitable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Still releasing potent high-octane riffage, they retread their path through cancer scares and jazz detoursThu 16 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 11.49 EDTShareIn the Bay Area of mid-1980s California, a heavy metal scene was forming that was angrier, louder and much, much faster than anything that came before: thrash. Progenitors Metallica are the most well-known of its alumni, but this corner of the West Coast spawned dozens of other brilliant bands seemingly unbounded by tempo, or sometimes even melody.With their blistering, high-octane riffing and superb technical chops, one of the most formidable and resilient is Testament. Despite having enough lineup changes to rival the Fall, cancer scares and the 1990s grunge takeover that edged out cut-off denim for plaid shirts, Testament are still selling out tours, gnashing at the heels of the commercially dominating Big Four metal bands – Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax – and releasing new records with just as much vigour. The most recent, Para Bellum, came out last week.It all started in late 1983 when, fresh from high school, Eric Peterson and cousin Derrick Ramirez from Alameda near Oakland, formed Testament’s precursor, Legacy. The two guitarists played their first show above a record store with local punks Rebels and Infidels, but their next – while clad in priest collars – was supporting Slayer. “That was our first taste of a sold-out crowd,” says Peterson, as the band dial in from their homes across the US. “We were so nervous. We only had four songs.”Ramirez soon quit, so Peterson recruited local Berkeley teenager Alex Skolnick – one of the most accomplished guitarists in metal, who studied under the virtuoso Joe Satriani. “I was into Ozzy and Dio,” says Skolnick. “Eric told me: we have to speed it up!”Completing the lineup was Louie Clemente on drums, bassist Greg Christian and Steve “Zetro” Souza on vocals. They’d go drinking together at the epicentre of the Bay Area thrash underground, Ruthie’s Inn; Peterson and Skolnick would “have a couple kamikazes [cocktails], plough our way through the crowd and just pummel people,” says Peterson of the pair’s boisterous moshpit demeanour. “They wouldn’t know what happened – that was kind of the vibe.”Souza quit to join fellow thrashers Exodus, leaving a gap for a frontman. The band knew a kid called Chuck Billy, known to Peterson and Clemente as The Cheese for his ever-present grin, who they’d occasionally spot hovering by beer kegs at parties. “He was very quiet but had a kind of sinister laugh,” says Peterson.The problem was that Billy fronted a hard-rocking glam band called Guilt: the kind of music that thrash metal fans poured scorn on, and sometimes worse. “You had to fit in: if you came from a glam band, and you went in [Ruthie’s Inn] – especially at Exodus shows – I think you got beaten up,” Peterson says. But when Billy decided to audition for Testament, Peterson and Clemente checked out a Guilt gig in San Francisco. “The guys had their Paul Stanley hair, doing their cute moves,” says Peterson. “Then Chuck came out wearing a trench coat and started breaking beer bottles over his head. He looked glam, but he had this presence.”View image in fullscreen‘Forget trying to float a melody’ … Testament in 1988.Photograph: Gene AmboBilly got the job, and thus began his glam deprogramming. Out with the spandex – a decision Billy says he was “happy for, believe me, being a big guy” – and in with Reebok hi-tops. Eric coached Billy into learning how to snarl along with the frenetic, bouncing-ball pace of thrash. “Forget trying to float a melody,” says Billy. “You have to keep up the pace.”By 1986, thrash metal was peaking. It was the year of Slayer’s furious 29-minute stormer Reign in Blood, Metallica’s Master of Puppets and Megadeth’s Peace Sells… But Who’s Buying? Somehow, the riffs got faster yet more complex, technical mastery mixed in with the breakneck speed. And it was the year Testament auditioned for Megaforce, the influential label that released Metallica’s first records. But the night that label owners Jon and Marsha were in town, Metallica’s wildly inventive bassist Cliff Burton, then only 24, was killed in a tour bus crash.“Our audition the next day was very sombre,” says Billy. “Here we were about to have the biggest performance of our lives in this unusual situation.” But Megaforce signed, the band changed their name to Testament and, in 1987, released debut album The Legacy to acclaim. Crammed into a van, the band toured extensively, supporting all the thrash mainstays – except Metallica, with Billy wondering if this is because Peterson married their guitarist Kirk Hammett’s ex – then climbing to top billing themselves.But with constant touring and the pressures of recording a new album each year, this hectic schedule eventually frayed relations. “Five records in a row, this pressure-cooker environment,” says Skolnick. “We were very young. I was a teen on that first record. After back-to-back recording and touring, we needed some rest and a long break, which we never had.”By now it was 1992 and grunge had swept in, hitting pause on thrash metal’s mainstream moment. Newly on Atlantic, Testament were under pressure to release something radio-friendly, which resulted in their next record The Ritual. Now a fan favourite, it was such a departure at the time that Testament refused to play its songs live. The frazzled Skolnick left to pursue jazz, later enrolling at the New School of Jazz and Contemporary Music (his other combo, the Alex Skolnick Trio, has a new record out too). “Louie and Greg were horrified,” Peterson says. “Me and Chuck were like, ‘OK’. The first thing I thought was: we can get heavy [again].”But a “scuff” led to Clemente quitting while on the road, leaving Testament without a drummer at a sold-out final show on Skolnick’s farewell tour. “We were inviting people from the crowd,” says Peterson. “Chuck was like: does anybody know this song? People are jumping up and giving it a go. It was a weird night, man.”View image in fullscreenChuck Billy performing in 2015.Photograph: Mark Horton/Getty ImagesTestament continued in one form or another, recruiting other acclaimed and storied musicians such as Slayer’s Dave Lombardo; they down-tuned their instruments and got even heavier, with Billy perfecting his death-metal growl on 1999’s The Gathering. But in 2001, Billy was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, with a large tumour lodged in his chest.While undergoing treatment, Billy – who was raised Catholic but whose father was Native American Pomo – reconnected with his Indigenous roots. Along with chemotherapy, he contacted Native healers and medicine men with whom he shared mysterious spiritual experiences involving wolf dens, chanting, eagle feathers and astral travel, and who he credits with helping him to fully recover.A 2005 tour with the classic lineup reunited the band, where one gig “turned into five, five turned into 10,” says Billy. But they played only occasionally and remained “off in these other worlds,” adds Skolnick, who was then a full-time session player. Billy worked in transport – giving safety lectures, presumably not about smashing bottles over one’s head – while Peterson focused on his symphonic black metal band, Dragonlord, until a major 2008 tour offer with Motörhead, Heaven & Hell and Judas Priest was offered on the condition they record a new album.View image in fullscreenNo sign of slowing down … Testament in 2025.Photograph: Fred KowaloSo they did – and never stopped. A couple of decades later, Testament show no signs of slowing down, save for the occasional ballad; with new drummer Chris Dovas in tow, their latest album, Para Bellum introduces elements like icy, black metal-style tremolo riffing,with themes covering the CIA agent-mangling Havana syndrome and, naturally, AI.“Destruction’s coming by the terabyte,” growls Billy on single, Infanticide AI, “the future’s destined to replace the soul” – though Skolnick believes metal music is safe from these techno-dystopian torments. “There’s no way it’s going to sound like guys getting in a room hashing out a tune and radiating as humans,” he says.And through all their winding sonic travels, lineup changes, trials and tribulations, the sounds of each of the band’s eras radiate something distinctly human. “They’re all just different modes of us, you know?” says Peterson.Para Bellum is out now on Nuclear Blast RecordsExplore more on these topicsMetalPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The bruises on her face were fading, but she was tanned by the sun, and her cheeks and the bridge of her nose not far off from being actually burnt, so she must find some cream or ointment to deal with that. A broad-brimmed hat would help too.She spread a very little of the rose salve on her nose and lips, her cheekbones and forehead. Then she sat down and thought about Ionides.He’d been very helpful so far, but could she trust him any further? This part of the world was completely new to her, whereas Ionides was at home with the languages here, and the customs, and the modes of travel. Could she manage without his guidance? She could probably afford it. She still had most of the gold that Farder Coram had given her. Ionides hadn’t let her down yet, and besides, she liked him.The man at Marletto’s, this Mustafa Bey whom Bud Schlesinger had recommended. She didn’t know what to do. The alethiometer would have helped her decide, of course; even without the books, and without risking the sickness and disorientation of the new method, she’d have gained something from it; her knowledge of the symbols was much greater than it had been, and just to hold it would have given her thoughts something to focus on. And now it was gone.But she still had the glass, and the needle. If she didn’t find something safe to keep them in, though, she might not have them for long. The glass was merely a glass (she supposed), but the needle . . . She took it very carefully out of the pocket it was in, and laid it in the centre of a piece of scrap paper, which she folded over and over till the needle couldn’t slip out, and put it in a compartment of her rucksack.Then she thought of the old gentleman on the train, and the cards he’d given her. She took out the pack and shuffled it and spread the cards face down on the bed beside her. Now what could she do? The alethiometer worked by blending the meanings of three symbols. Should she pick three cards? Or just one? Or what?She chose one and turned it over. It showed a man behind a barricade trying to defend it from a group of soldiers, against a background of gunfire and bursting shells. She looked at it despondently for a minute or so, and gathered the cards together again.Ionides sprang to his feet as soon as he saw her come downstairs.‘Miss Silver! Now I am your guide and guardian for the journey to Marletto’s Café. May I ask if you are hoping to see the well-known and respected Mustafa Bey?’‘How did you know that?’‘It was a guess purely and entirely. A traveller of your consequence would of course wish to pay her respects to such an important gentleman, and Marletto’s is where he is to be found. It is as good as a headquarters for his multitude of enterprises.’She smiled – and it occurred to her that she couldn’t remember the last time a smile had come to her faceHe held open the hotel door and walked along beside her with the air of a senior courtier accompanying a princess. He looked no different from the ragged and none-too-clean individual who had first appeared outside her hotel room in Seleukeia, but he bore himself with such confidence and brio that Lyra felt herself to be acting a part too, and enjoying the attention of other passersby. Most of those who looked at her were disconcerted, of course, by her lack of a dæmon, but she remembered the woman she’d seen in Amsterdam, strolling along magnificently indifferent to the hostile stares of other people, and she remembered Farder Coram’s advice too, to bear herself like a queen.‘Mr Ionides,’ she said.‘I am all ears,’ he declared.‘From now on my name is Tatiana Iorekova. I am a queen of the witches of Novaya Zemlya. You are a magician from Prague, and you are in my service.’‘Ah! I completely understand. This is how I shall present you to Mustafa Bey, no?’‘That’s correct.’‘And what is my name?’‘Magister Parathanasius.’‘Parathanasius. A fine name, which I shall strive to deserve. How should I address you, Queen Tatiana?’‘Like that. Say Queen Tatiana, may I present His Excellency Mustafa Bey?’‘Not “Your Majesty”?’‘No. We witches live plainly and without ceremony. Ah! – Wait here.’ She had noticed something in the window of a dress shop, and went inside. After a minute she came out with a length of narrow scarlet ribbon.‘That for me or for you?’ said Ionides.She smiled, which surprised him, and it occurred to her that she couldn’t remember the last time a smile had come to her face. She tied the ribbon around her head, across the middle of her brow, and let the ends fall in front of her right ear.Ionides watched critically, and said, ‘You permit?’She nodded, and he adjusted the ribbon slightly.‘There. Very royal. What my name again?’‘Parathanasius. Magister. Like Maestro. Master Parathanasius.’‘From Prague.’‘That’s right.’He looked around. The street was busy; it was a late morning in a prosperous cosmopolitan city, and no one knew they were in the presence of a queen and a magician.‘All right, Queen Tatiana Iorekova,’ he said seriously. ‘You wanted me to guide you to Aleppo. Here we are, and you will soon pay me forty dollars–’‘Thirty.’‘As you say. When I take you to Mustafa Bey our contract will expire, not so?’‘That’s right.’‘And what then? The whole of Asia is open to you. What is your destination? Will you require a guide to accompany you there?’She had already made her mind up, but there were formalities and customs to observe.‘Master Parathanasius, this is not the right place nor the right time. A queen of the witches does not bargain in the street. When I have concluded my business with Mustafa Bey, you and I shall go to another smaller café and discuss the matters you raise over a glass of tea.’He nodded slowly. His expression was serious, his clothing ragged and dirty, the scar across his face white against the brown skin and the greying stubble. He looked like a beggar. But he stood upright, his body was lean and tense, and his eyes were alive with complicity and, deep inside, amusement.‘All right, we go to find Mustafa Bey,’ he said. ‘You come with me, Queen Tatiana, and my magic powers find the way.’He strode along beside her for all the world as if he really was a magician in the service of a queen. Lyra was pleased with her own bearing too. Like panthers, that was the way Farder Coram had described the way witches bore themselves. She found herself thinking something unexpected: she wanted Abdel Ionides to feel proud of her.He swept imperiously into the entrance of Marletto’s, stopping in mock astonishment only when a white-aproned waiter said a few words in French, sharply, and barred his way.‘Vous nous prenez pour des MENDIANTS?’ Ionides said in high indignation. ‘Écoutez, espèce d’imbécile. Voici sa majesté la reine Tatiana Iorekova, qui gouverne le royaume entier de Novaya Zemlya, et moi qui suis son sorcier particulier, le gardien de ses finances, le président de conseil de ses affaires d’état, le Maître Parathanasius!Queen Tatiana,’ he went on, turning to Lyra and switching in a moment from arrogant to emollient. ‘I apologise for the ignorance of this low-born rascal. Please forgive him, because now he knows who you are, he will hasten to bring you everything you desire, and conduct us without delay to a corner of this establishment which is fit to receive us. ‘And,’ he added to the waiter, ‘take word to His Excellency Mustafa Bey that Queen Tatiana Iorekova will receive him at once.’The waiter looked from Ionides to Lyra, from Queen Tatiana to Master Parathanasius. Ionides was bursting with angry pride, and Lyra held herself still and faced down the waiter with a gaze that came from the coldest fastnesses of the northern ice. Privately she was delighted.The waiter bowed nervously and led the way to a corner shaded by a potted palm whose leaves waved delicately in the breeze from a fan on the ceiling. Ionides held out a chair for her while the waiter hastened away.‘When you’ve presented him to me, you can go,’ Lyra said quietly. ‘I saw a fountain in the square as we came through. I’ll meet you there in about an hour.’‘You don’t need interpreter?’‘I’m sure I can manage. Here he comes.’Mustafa Bey was a large man in a physical sense, and an imposing one. His wealth was visible in the exquisitely cut cream linen suit, the hand-made shoes, the massive gold watch on his wrist, the golden signet ring on his little finger, the immaculately groomed grey hair; his power was manifest in the way he seemed to carry a field of magnetic force around him, compelling attention, demanding respect, knowing with utter certainty that his every wish would be not only fulfilled, but anticipated. His dæmon was a cheetah. If Lyra had not been a queen, she might even have been intimidated.Ionides inclined his head briefly and said, ‘Queen Tatiana, may I present His Excellency Mustafa Bey?’Lyra extended her right hand. The great merchant bent to kiss it, and Lyra responded with a smile.‘Please join me, Mustafa Bey,’ she said. ‘I know how busy you are. I would be grateful for a few minutes of your time.’She indicated a chair, and Mustafa Bey sat down. Ionides was giving an order to the waiter, who hurried away, and then Master Parathanasius bowed deeply to Lyra and withdrew. Mustafa Bey still had not said a word.‘I was advised to consult you,’ Queen Tatiana said, ‘by a learned scholar in Oxford, Doctor Sebastian Makepeace.’The merchant’s large and profoundly dark eyes widened a fraction of a millimetre. His expression changed from one unreadability to another.‘And there was a friend I last saw in Smyrna,’ she went on, ‘who said that the one source of all the information I would ever need on my journey was Mustafa Bey, whom I would find in this café. One such recommendation would have been enough to make me come here – two, and I had no choice. Mustafa Bey, I am glad to meet you. Will you take tea with me?’She could see the waiter hastening to her table with a loaded tray.‘I would be honoured,’ said the merchant. His voice was unexpectedly light and gentle.View image in fullscreen‘Mustafa Bey’s dæmon was a cheetah. If Lyra had not been a queen, she might even have been intimidated.’Illustration: Chris WormellThe tea was poured, the pastries were set out, the waiter bowed and left.Mustafa Bey was not going to start this conversation. He was a busy man, but he was clearly curious, and Lyra was aware that they were being watched by many eyes that were equally interested. She was glad she had not come to him as a petitioner, having to wait to be seen: this table gave her a little enclave in the middle of his territory, like an embassy, where she could command things, to which she could summon him, from which she could dictate the course of their encounter. It also meant that the initiative belonged to her: she must get on with it.‘As I mentioned, Mustafa Bey,’ she said, ‘I’m on a journey. I want to travel to the desert of Karamakan, and I would like to ask the advice of someone who knows the Silk Roads as well as anyone alive.’‘My advice would be a single word: Don’t.’‘I shall bear that in mind, but I won’t take it. I’m determined to go.’‘What do you think you will find there?’‘A red building that contains something of immense value.’‘And what is that? Do you know what is in this red building?’‘Yes, I believe I do.’‘And you still want to go there, and put your life in danger, and risk not being able to return?’‘Yes.’He sipped the hot tea. Despite his bulk, all his movements were delicate and graceful.‘I have never been to the red building myself,’ he said, ‘but I know the conditions under which it must be approached. The traveller by land, the dæmon by water. Do you?’‘Yes, I do.’‘And your dæmon?’‘The witches of the Arctic have the power of separation. At the moment, my dæmon is attending to an important piece of business somewhere else.’He nodded, and set a calming hand on the head of his cheetah-dæmon. ‘And what do you need to know about the journey between here and Karamakan?’‘How long does it take for a camel-train to go that far?’‘Six months, more or less.’‘And a traveller alone?’‘Less time, but more danger.’‘Danger from what, Mustafa Bey?’‘Bandits on the ground. And even more from birds in the air. There are no zeppelin routes across these lands for that reason. The birds are immense and ferocious. They command the air almost entirely. Do your people ever fly across Central Asia?’‘Very seldom.’‘With good reason. But, Queen Tatiana, you are not telling me the truth.’Lyra was aware of a deep soft growl, almost too quiet to hear. It was the merchant’s dæmon, whose black-rimmed eyes were staring at her throat.‘In what way?’ said Lyra. Her skin was prickling.‘You are not a witch. I have dealt with many witches – please do not interrupt me – and you are not one.’‘Could you tell at once?’‘No. I had to listen to you first. Now I am certain. Your name is Lyra Silvertongue.’The Rose Field: The Book of Dust Volume Three will be published in hardback, trade paperback, ebook and audiobook – narrated by Michael Sheen – on 23 October by David Fickling Books in association with Penguin Random House in the UK, featuring illustrations from Chris Wormell.

With a vibe that has more in common with an Alpine spa hotel than the poky rooms and grim corridors usually associated with housing for elderly people, the building – by architects Witherford Watson Mann – reinvents the almshouse for the modern era as a place of care, shelter and social connection.As a building type, the origins of almshouses extend back centuries, giving a semblance of dignity to the poor, the old, the sick and the marginalised. Sequestered from the outside world, with cellular dwellings arrayed around courtyards, they evoke a sense of pastoral benevolence.View image in fullscreenA sense of pastoral benevolence … the central courtyard.Photograph: Philip VileFor Witherford Watson Mann, the challenge was not only how to rethink the traditional almshouse form, but also how to look beyond the simple provision of housing, to conceive of it as the heart of a hosting network, a set of rooms to be shared with like-minded local organisations. The client, United St Saviour’s, a charity based in Southwark, London, is also a grant-making trust, supporting refugee groups and youth centres, as well as cultural organisations. The aim is that these will make use of the building’s communal spaces, so it feels like an integral part of local life, rather than some kind of secluded retirement enclave.Set in Bermondsey, in south-east London, among Victorian terraces and postwar blocks, Appleby Blue is on a site previously occupied by a disused care home. Its intended clientele are those over 65 who meet the charity’s definition of being in financial need and who have lived in the local borough of Southwark for more than three years. The scheme’s 57 bright, spacious flats for single people and couples are arranged around a central courtyard filled with shimmering ginkgo trees and tinkling pools.Appleby is a doughty, five storey block of mottled brown and blue brick with pale oak window frames expressively counterpointing the dark masonry. To the rear, deferring to the scale of the Victorian terraces, it steps down to a smaller, two storey volume topped with a roof garden populated with raised beds and sitting nooks. Dedicated to cultivating produce for use in the almshouse kitchen, it is maintained by a local gardening group, with residents also making horticultural contributions.View image in fullscreenDesigned for gossiping … the ‘civic room’.Photograph: Philip VileAt the building’s heart overlooking the ginkgo tree courtyard, is the double height garden room, designed to host an array of activities. Beyond the daily routines of eating, drinking, gossiping and watching the world go by, these might include coffee mornings, film nights, dance classes, markets, music performances, plays and making workshops.The human theatre of this “civic room” can be seen from the street through a timber and glass walkway that projects out along the main facade, like a huge shop window. “The idea was to build right in the heart of the community, in a busy place, with a very direct relationship to the high street, not to hide people away,” says project architect Stephen Witherford.A key move was to get rid of claustrophobic and disorienting internal corridors. Instead, access to individual flats is through glazed galleries that wrap around the south side of the main block. Furnished with robust oak benches, quarry tiled floors and planting boxes, the galleries act as informal inside-outside spaces in which to sit contemplatively or natter with neighbours, while savouring views of the Victorian terrace gardens and the hills of suburban London beyond. In warmer weather, the galleries can be opened up through large sliding screens.In its architecture and operation, Appleby Blue is a consciously extrovert presence and a retort to the prevalent notion that older people (especially poorer older people) should be shunted to the urban and sociocultural margins, with adverse consequences for their mental and physical health. By reimagining later living as a collective experience, it draws its residents together in a building that elevates the everyday.View image in fullscreenCultivating produce for the kitchen … the rooftop gardens.Photograph: Philip VileOn behalf of the Stirling prize jury, Ingrid Schroder, director of the Architectural Association School ofArchitecture, said: “Designing social housing for later life is too often reduced to a simple provision of service. Appleby Blue, however, is a provision of pure delight. Its architects have crafted high-quality spaces that are generous and thoughtful, blending function and community to create environments that truly care for their residents.”For all its admirable intentions, Appleby Blue is still a drop in a vast ocean of need. But in suggesting different ways of doing things, it does constitute an exemplar that has the potential to be replicated. And though it’s not all “rainbows and unicorns”, as Witherford admits, the residents take evident pleasure in their surroundings and relish being part of the almshouse community.Seeing off competition from larger, more “statement” projects – including the restoration of the Palace of Westminster’sElizabeth Tower– this is Witherford Watson Mann’s second Stirling prize. In 2013 the practice won for its imaginative remodelling of the ruined Apsley Castle in Warwickshire for the Landmark Trust. Restoring a fire ravaged stately home and designing social housing for older people might seem worlds apart yet both are underscored by a thoughtful sensitivity to context and the impetus to transform and transcend.Explore more on these topicsStirling prizeAwards and prizesArchitectureArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite the fact that some of the carefully packaged works were not correctly numbered, making “an exhaustive check” impossible, the delivery was signed off and the van and its crew went on their way.The following Monday, the pieces, which had been under video surveillance all weekend, were unpacked.“Once the unpacking had been done, by the CajaGranada foundation’s own staff, the works were moved to different parts of the exhibition room,” the foundation said in a statement. “Mid-morning that day, the exhibition’s curator and the foundation’s head of exhibitions noticed that one work was missing. The piece is a small gouache byPablo Picasso, called Still Life with Guitar.”The foundation said it had reported the painting’s disappearance to the Policía Nacional, adding: “We have also put ourselves at the disposal of those investigating, and we have complete faith that the case will be properly resolved.”Spanishmedia reportssuggested the van may have stopped overnight near Granada, and that the two people aboard may have taken turns guarding its precious cargo.Picasso’s fame – and the enormous sums his works command – have long made his art a target for thieves around the world.In February 2007, two Picasso paintings worth a total of €50m were stolen from the Parishome of the artist’s granddaughter. Two years later,a Picasso sketchbook worth more than €8mwas stolen from a Paris museum dedicated to the artist.Twelve Picasso paintings, valued at around £9m, were stolen from the French Riviera villa of another of his grandchildren, Marina Picasso, in 1989.Several other Picasso paintings have been stolen from galleries. In 1976, 118 works were stolen from a museum in the southern city of Avignon in one of France’s largest art thefts.In 1997, a gunman walked into a central London art gallery and stole Picasso’sTête de Femme, worth more than £500,000, before fleeing in a taxi. The work was later recovered.Explore more on these topicsArt theftPablo PicassoSpainExhibitionsGrenadaEuropeArtnewsShareReuse this content"

Now the entire audience will hear such descriptions, within a groundbreaking work that explores how blindness can redefine our responses to sensation, sound and storytelling.Devon Healey, a blind artist, is collaborating with Sir Wayne McGregor, among other choreographers, and the composer Max Richter in creating a new RoyalBalletcommission that will be premiered on 12 November, World Ballet Day, it will be announced on Thursday.In her art, Healey is guided by a desire to show how blindness and disability can offer an alternative form of perception for everyone. Her “immersive descriptive audio”, woven with the music, is at the centre of the performance on stage.“Making world-class ballet and opera for everyone” is a motto of the Royal Opera House. Under Kevin O’Hare, the Royal Ballet’s director, the company is focusing on “radical accessibility – inviting artists and audiences to experience ballet in transformative new ways”, he said.The new work is being choreographed by Tiler Peck, Bim Malcomson and Rebecca Myles Stewart, as well as McGregor, each collaborating with Healey.Robert Binet, the curator of this commission, said: “World Ballet Day was founded on the principle of access. After a decade, we’re pushing that concept further to consider how disabled perspectives can shape our art form, and invite audiences of all abilities and experiences to experience dance in new ways.”Having worked with Healey in Canada and Australia, he realised that sighted people who had experienced Healey’s descriptive audio felt it helped them understand dance, which can seem so abstract.In one duet, the Royal Ballet dancer Leo Dixon will partner Takashi Kikuchi, an amateur dancer who has been visually impaired since birth and who had long assumed that ballet was “mainly for sighted people”. But Kikuchi has realised that it actually “involves a lot of feeling and emotions” and taps into senses, “visual and non-visual”.Kikuchi’s personal story of once getting lost on his way home and relying on the sun to orient his way back had inspired a duet in which Dixon becomes the “warm breath of the sun around Kikuchi as they move together”, Malcomson said.Kikuchi recalled: “It was mid-afternoon and I had a feeling that the sun should be shining from the west. So, if I faced the sunshine, even though I wouldn’t see the sunlight itself, I could feel the heat … So I kept walking to the west …. It led me home. The sunshine was a good helper to me. The sun could be a good symbol. So the story emerged from there.”Healey, an assistant professor of disability studies at the University of Toronto, said: “Blindness and being blind invites a dynamic relationship with movement in a way that is similar to a professional dancer’s relationship with their body and movement.”In collaborating with the dancers, she was seeking to convey what “they’re experiencing in their body, something that’s just not accessible through sight”, she said. “I speak with the dancers to get a sense of how they’re feeling in their body, where their breath is, what they’re thinking about, how their muscles are feeling.“In collaboration with the choreographers [and] costume, lighting, set and sound designers, the perceptions and creativity of blindness are ever present as we, blind and sighted people, develop a rapport through our love of movement and dance. It is this creativity and love that I try to weave into the immersive descriptive audio. It is a collaboration of the senses guided by blindness.”She added: “Even though the sight of the dance, the beautiful visual feast, is there before the audience, there is so much that they’re not accessing or appreciating, and it is blindness that is inviting sighted and blind audience members alike into the unseen. What I hope is that, when audience members leave, they feel dance in a different way, and they’re also feeling the presence, and listening to the perceptions of, blindness in new and dynamic ways.”Richter’s recordings have amassed more than 3.5bn streams. Healey said the audio descriptions create a rapport between blindness and sight “through a soundscape, giving voice to that which does not always appear”. She added: “It is not merely a description of a performance. It is performance.”The Royal Ballet’s international partners for World Ballet Day include the National Ballet of Canada and the Australian Ballet. The companies will also offer access to behind-the-scenes footage, rehearsals and newly commissioned works – streamed live viaworldballetday.com.Explore more on these topicsRoyal BalletBlindness and visual impairmentDisabilityBalletDancenewsShareReuse this content"

While 2025’s nominations are the most diverse ever, with six regions of England represented as well as acts from Scotland, Wales and Ireland present, 2024’s shortlist saw just six regions or countries represented, and there were just four in 2023, when nine of the 12 nominations went to acts from London.Since 2010 only three winners did not come from London and, between 2014 and 2023, every winner came from the city, with Leeds band English Teacher’s win in 2024 stopping the trend. In the competition’s history, more winners have come from London than all the other winners combined, 17 coming from the capital.graph showing how London dominates the Mercury prizeIn 2020, of the 12 acts shortlisted for the prize only one came from outside southern England, the Newcastle based rock band Lanterns on the Lake. Vocalist Hazel Wilde said that, while the group had been thrilled to be nominated and excited that the ceremony would take place in their home city, they found it “surprising” they had been the only act from outside London five years ago and hoped the awards would evolve.CMAT, Pulp and PinkPantheress among Mercury prize shortlist light on new namesRead more“The Mercury prize has always been the alternative to the usual major-label backed or London-centric awards like the Brits,” Wilde said. “It’s all about the album. But I think people see it as slipping into that world a little bit – perhaps because those are the kind of artists who are able to survive in this climate.”There is also a lack of diversity in the countries represented. Only inaugural winners Primal Scream, 2004 winners Franz Ferdinand and 2014 winners Young Fathers, have come from outside England, with victorious acts yet to come from Wales or Ireland at all.View image in fullscreenGwenno was nominated for a Mercury prize in 2022.Photograph: Harold Cunningham/WireImageGwenno, a Cardiff-born singer who was nominated in 2022 and who has recorded albums in the Welsh and Cornish languages, said: “The UK is the most centralised political system in Europe and everything we do is influenced by that, sadly, including our music industry.“I’m really confident in the abilities of all the nations to produce incredible music, and our ability as music fans and people who want to celebrate great music to work alongside each other in a more progressive way in what I see as the final dust of Empire.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In an excerpt published by theNew York Times, Federline alleged their sons “would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep – ‘Oh, you’re awake?’ – with a knife in her hand. Then she’d turn around and pad off without explanation.”From Elton John at the piano to Stormzy at Glastonbury and Madonna snogging Britney: 41 era-defining music photosRead moreFederline told the New York Times he had not spoken to Spears in years, but said he learned about her alleged behaviour from their two sons.Federline also writes in the book about the conservatorship Spears was under between 2008 and 2021, which saw her father control her life and finances. The arrangement prompted Spears’ fans to form the #FreeBritney movement to have her independence restored.While the #FreeBritney movement may have “started from a good place”, Federline writes in the book, “All those people who put so much effort into that should now put the same energy into the ‘Save Britney’ movement. Because this is no longer about freedom. It’s about survival.”“This situation with Britney feels like it’s racing toward something irreversible,” he writes. “It’s become impossible to pretend everything’s OK. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we’re getting close to the 11th hour. Something bad is going to happen if things don’t change, and my biggest fear is that our sons will be left holding the pieces.”On Wednesday, Spears disputed Federline’s depiction in a statement on social media.“The constant gaslighting from ex-husband is extremely hurtful and exhausting,” the eight-time Grammy-winning artist wrote on X. “I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys.”She said she felt “demoralised by this situation” and that she had seldom seen her sons, who are now 19 and 20 years old, in recent years.“Relationships with teenage boys is complex,” she wrote. “They need to take responsibility for themselves. With one son only seeing me for 45 min in the past five years and the other with only four visits in the past five years. I have pride too. From now on I will let them know when I am available.”“Trust me, those white lies in that book, they are going straight to the bank and I am the only one who genuinely gets hurt here,” she added.She said she had been living a “sacred and private life” since she was released from the conservatorship.In an earlier statement, a spokesperson for the pop star told the New York Times, “With news from Kevin’s book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James and their wellbeing during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.”In Spears’ 2023 memoir, The Woman in Me, the pop star claimed that, during their custody battle, Federline “tried to convince everyone that I was completely out of control”.Explore more on these topicsBritney SpearsAutobiography and memoirnewsShareReuse this content"

In a video acceptance speech, the conductor said: “I was 10 years old when I started spending my pocket money on Gramophone magazine … this is an extraordinary honour.” Video tributes to Rattle from fellow musicians included Barbara Hannigan, Peter Hoare, Thomas Quasthoff, and composer John Adams, who said: “How can someone be one of the great conductors of our time and also just a plain wonderful mensch, a good guy who cares deeply … To have worked with him, to have heard him do my music with the intensity and passion that he’s given it – it’s been one of the great pleasures of my life.”Hannigan said: “You are such an inspiration to me and to so many musicians and audiences with your boundless curiosity, your kindness and the energy you bring to everything you do.”Widely regarded as the classical recording world’s ultimate accolade, the awards – presented with Presto Music – celebrate exceptional recordings and honour artists, ensembles and record labels. The recording of the year was awarded to the French conductor Raphaël Pichon and his choir and period-instrument orchestraPygmalionfor their recording of JS Bach’s Mass in B Minor on theHarmonia Mundilabel. Gramophone hailed the performance as one “that gleams at the cellular level, radiating outwards with devotional warmth; in short, it is alive”.View image in fullscreenMaría Dueñas, winner of young artist of the year, performs at the Gramophone awards 2025.Photograph: Jamie HodgskinRising starMaría Dueñas, 22, was named young artist of the year. The Spanish violinist, who won first prize at the Menuhin competition in 2021 and records for Deutsche Grammophon, also took the instrumental category for her album of Paganini’s 24 Caprices.Two world premiere recordings won awards. The first – not surprisingly – was in the contemporary category, with the award going to Sir George Benjamin’s live recording of his 2023 opera Picture a Day Like This, with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. The second, remarkably, was for music dating back at least 600 years but that has only seen the light of day this past year.The Krasiński Codex: Fifteenth-Century Music from Cracowwas awarded the early music recording of the year prize. The extraordinary recording is of music from a mid-1420s manuscript that narrowly avoided destruction in 1944 when the library of the Polish nobleman Wincenty Krasiński fell victim to Nazi arson. This particular manuscript, the Krasiński Codex, was one of the only documents saved from the fire, possibly by a musicologist working for the Third Reich who recognised its importance and stole it, saving it from oblivion.The codex was returned to Poland in 1948 and the music collected on it and now recorded for the first time – over 40 mostly polyphonic pieces – is a testament to the rich musical landscape of the late middle ages, and provides a unique picture of European musical culture at the time.Baritone Sir Thomas Allen was presented with the lifetime achievement award by Gerald Finley (himself a winner, in the opera category for his recording, withLise Davidsen, of Wagner’s Flying Dutchman). The celebrated British singer, who was born in County Durham in 1944, made his Covent Garden debut in 1971 and over the past five decades has performed in opera houses around the world in repertoire ranging from Mozart toBrittenand Strauss to Sondheim. He made his final stage appearance last summer, inGlyndebourne’s The Merry Widow.Accepting the award in person, Allen paid tribute to the many legendary singers he had worked with over his long career on stage: “I feel like a tiny, tiny prawn in a sea of greatness.” And he ended his acceptance speech with touching and heartfelt words of thanks to his longtime agent, Sue Spence, and his wife, Jeannie.Full details of the winners and their recordings are onGramophone’s website.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaSimon RattlenewsShareReuse this content"

The performances are excellent, the action is tense and the script is highly eruditeHannah J DaviesThu 16 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Oct 2025 00.04 EDTShareOver two high-stakes seasons, this drama about a US ambassador to the UK who finds herself moonlighting for the president and the entire state department has proved itself to be a rare beast: a political thriller that is frequently excellent, often erudite (a character once referred to another as “the Hecate of Highgate” instead of just calling her a stirrer), but which also requires the total and utter suspension of your disbelief. Question any of it for a second – as I did in the final episode of this third series, when the new US president asks the prime minister whether Chequers is his family’s ancestral seat – and it begins to crumble. But if you file it firmly within the category of spicy geopolitical soap? Boy oh boy, is it good.We pick up where season two left off, and the aftermath of a car bomb that badly injured Kate’s (Keri Russell) on/off husband, Hal (Rufus Sewell). Meanwhile, British PM Nicol Trowbridge (Rory Kinnear) is still apoplectic about the actions of Tory fixer Margaret Roylin (Celia Imrie), who proved to be not only an irritant with a direct line to the Daily Mail, but the mastermind of a false-flag operation that implicated Russia. Of course, what our canny diplomat Kate knows is that Roylin was acting on behalf of someone even more influential: US vice-president Grace Penn (Allison Janney), whose job Kate was eyeing up last season. Everyone has more pressing concerns, however: when he found out the truth about Penn, President Rayburn carked it in the final moments of season two, leaving Penn to step up and creating a vacancy for VP. Surely Kate is a shoo-in as Penn’s deputy, especially with this much collateral on her?View image in fullscreenCelia Imrie as Margaret Roylin in The Diplomat.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixOf course, with there being eight episodes to fill, Kate does not simply pack up her large collection of trouser suits and leg it to the White House to get down to some paperwork. Not least because Penn doesn’t choose her for VP – she picks noted manchild Hal instead. He takes the role but insists he’ll find something for Kate to do; rather than suggesting something in the vein of, say, Melania Trump’s Be Best anti-bullying campaign, he decides maybe she can lead on the reconstruction of Ukraine or maybe pull up a chair with Nato.What follows is an increasingly ludicrous tale, as Kate attempts to hang on to her ambassador role while also dropping into DC now and again for second lady duty. I suppose there isn’t really a show called The Diplomat if the lead character isn’t a diplomat any more, but it is so stressful watching her pinball between the two countries, standing up the director of the CIA because she’s forgotten to check Google Calendar. The whole thing is – as put-upon White House chief of staff Billie Appiah (Nana Mensah) puts it – “a cockamamie arrangement”, though you may prefer stronger terms. Kate does, at least, bag a boyfriend along the way, played by Poldark’s Aidan Turner, who says things like “in a day or so, [Hal’s] going to go back to Washington, and I’m going to take all your clothes off”. It isn’t the sexiest dialogue ever but saves on limited time, due to all of the above and a new military threat.View image in fullscreen‘Keri Russell does defeated, stressed and angry all at once again with mastery’ …Photograph: NetflixThere are, I’m glad to report, some excellent performances, not least from West Wing alums Janney and Bradley Whitford, who reconnect here with each other and with showrunner Debora Cahn. They are reunited as Penn and her husband, Todd, an “increasingly insignificant househusband married to a supernova” who stifles all of his frustration beneath a rictus grin, à la Succession’s Connor Roy. Keri Russell does defeated, stressed and angry all at once again with mastery, especially when she’s telling her lookalike decoy to buy a hairbrush. I struggle to care too much about the ongoing will they/won’t they dynamic between Kate’s right-hand man Stuart (Ato Essandoh) and CIA chief Eidra Park (Ali Ahn), but I am still glad to see them all there, like old friends (albeit the sort of friends who talk solely about political conspiracies and whether or not they should kiss). We also learn more about Kate and Hal’s marriage, and the ebb and flow of power between these two that helps to contextualise flippant lines from earlier in the series, like the time Kate absent-mindedly mentioned her other half had once been kidnapped by Hezbollah.The final two episodes see us hurtle towards a startlingly similar conclusion to last season, and there are moments where it begins to drag. But, on the whole, The Diplomat remains a treat. Keep that disbelief close, and it will feel more like a comedy in places. But keep it at bay, and – much like our own real-world politics – it is a nail-biter.The Diplomat is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Along with witchcraft and necromancy, Hekate is also associated with boundaries and crossroads, acting as protector and guide to lost travellers. In art, she is commonly depicted holding torches to show the way, and accompanied by a black dog or serpent.In Hekate the Witch, the poet Nikita Gill reimagines the life of this enigmatic goddess in verse. Born during a war between the old Titan rulers and new Gods of Olympia, Hekate is birthed alone by her Titan mother, Asteria, who tells her she is destined for greatness. The pair live alone in a dilapidated palace but are forced to flee when Zeus and Poseidon come to enslave them. Seeking refuge in the Underworld, Asteria is denied entry but Hekate, still a Godling, is admitted and taken into the care of Styx and Hades. There, she briefly meets her father, Perses, chained to a mountain after the Titan defeat, who predicts a future for his daughter in which “the dead will bow to you as you move in their wake”.Gill, who specialises in women-centric retellings of Greek and Hindu myths, is our propulsive and charismatic narrator. She depicts Hekate less as a sinister deity than a traumatised youngster looking for love and a sense of belonging, and whose divine powers alarm the Gods of Olympus. “The sound that swelled from their halls around my name was not laughter,” Hekate reflects. “But hushed whispers of fear.”Available via Simon & Schuster Audio, 6hr 9minFurther listeningI Want to Go Home But I’m Already ThereRóisín Lanigan, Penguin Audio, 8hr 53minRuby Campbell narrates this tale of a young couple, Áine and Elliot, who move into an affluent city neighbourhood full of bakeries and yoga studios.

With its 1970s small-town setting, high school cast, psychic kids and gnarly neighbourhood villain, it was close to pastiche and, like the very worst of King’s stories, it was also inelegantly overstuffed.Funnily enough the call came from inside the family home, as it was based on a short story from King’s son Joe Hill, over-extended into a film that was a surprise $161m hit. It was the story of the Grabber, a sadistic killer of young boys who would revel in elongating the ritual of their deaths. While sexual abuse was never mentioned, there was something inescapably queer-coded about the character and the historical touchpoints/moral panics he was clearly supposed to refer to, reinforced byEthan Hawkeplaying him with a certain swishy, effeminate flare (even before his appearance, the word fag had also been liberally used). But the film was too opaque to ever really admit that and even without that uneasiness, it was too busily plotted and too high on its exhaustingly grubby nastiness to work as anything more than an undiscerning sleepover nightmare fuel.Ballad of a Small Player review – Colin Farrell seeks redemption in Edward Berger’s high-stakes gambling yarnRead moreIts sequel arrives as former horror hit-makers Blumhouse are in desperate need of a win. This year they have struggled to make anything work, from Wolf Man to The Woman in the Yard to Drop to the total box office disaster of M3gan 2.0, and so a great deal rides on whether Black Phone 2 can prove whether a short story can become a movie that can spawn a franchise. There’s just one slight problem …The first film ended with our Final Boy Finn (Mason Thames) killing the Grabber, assisted and trained by the ghosts of those he had killed before (andhis psychic sister helping to track down his location – see, busy!). It’s forced writer-director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer C Robert Cargill to take the series and its killer to a new place, turning a flesh and blood villain into a supernatural one, a route that takes them via Elm Street with an ability to cross back into the real world facilitated by dreams. But unlike Freddy Krueger, the Grabber is markedly uninventive and entirely devoid of humour (this time Hawke also plays him without any of the same camp-ness, perhaps reading the room a little …). The mask remains effectively jarring but the film struggles to make him as frightening as he briefly was in the first, trapped by convoluted and often confusing rules.Finn and his annoyingly foul-mouthed sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw) encounter him again while snowed in at an alpine Christian camp for kids, the sequel also nodding toward Freddy’s one-time nemesis Jason Voorhees (both would make mincemeat of the Grabber). Gwen is guided there by a vision of her late mother and what might be their late tormenter’s first victims while Finn, still trying to process his anger and newfound ability to fight back, is following so he can protect her. The script is too ungainly in its contrived scene-setting, clumsily needing to get the siblings stranded at a place that will also add to backstories for both protagonist and antagonist, filling in details we didn’t really need or want to know about (as a mystery, it’s not all that interesting). In what also feels like a more calculated move to edge the film toward the same church-attending crowds that turned the Conjuring franchise into massive hits, Derrickson adds a religious element, with good now more closely associated with God and heaven while bad represents the devil and hell, faith the ultimate weapon against a monster like this.What all of this does is further over-stack a series that was already close to toppling over, adding unnecessary complications to what should be a simple Friday night engine (I often found myself too busy asking questions about the the hows and whys of what could or couldn’t happen to feel all that involved). It’s a low-lift effort for Hawke, whose face we never really see (it could, for all we know as viewers, be purely voice work) but he does have genuine presence that’s mostly missing elsewhere in the cast. The setting is at times atmospherically grand but the majority of the consistently un-scary set pieces are marred by a grainy 8mm texture to differentiate asleep and awake, an ineffective stylistic choice that feels too self-aware and constructed to mirror the horrifying unpredictability of being in an actual nightmare.At just under two hours, Black Phone 2, like M3gan 2.0 before it, is a needlessly long and hugely unconvincing argument for the birth of a new franchise. The next time it rings, I recommend not answering.Black Phone 2 is out in Australian cinemas on 16 October and in the US and UK on 17 OctoberExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsEthan HawkereviewsShareReuse this content"

Quite something, because of the competition. One of the great strengths of this rewarding production – the first to be staged by James Brining since he became artistic director – is its sharp characterisation. Every one of Chekhov’s frustrated figures, variously in search of love, validation and applause, is drawn here in bold lines, clear and precise.For Quentin to stand out in the role of Irina Arkadina, the egotistical repertory actor slumming it in the country for the summer, means pulling the focus from a richly realised ensemble. When she holds court, centre stage, it is as if she draws Lizzie Powell’s early-autumn lights towards her, glowing in the attention while the rest of the busy household becomes her attentive, obedient audience.“I care about myself,” she says, leaving a fractional pause before spitting out: “… passionately!”It is a funny, bold performance and starry only in the sense she is playing a star. In Mike Poulton’s light-footed translation, Quentin plays just one lost soul among many. She turns her insecurities into noise and fanfare, in contrast to the quiet despair of a boozy Masha (Tallulah Greive), a hangdog Medvedenko (Michael Dylan) or an apologetic Polina (Irene Allan) – all excellent.View image in fullscreenRewarding production … Harmony Rose-Bremner in The Seagull.Photograph: Mihaela BodlovicHer young lover Trigorin (Dyfan Dwyfor) keeps quiet and goes along for the ride, while her son Konstantin (Lorn Macdonald) is trapped in an Oedipal bind, unsure whether to upturn or embrace the old order. Such an attitude fails to impress aspirant actor Nina (Harmony Rose-Bremner) who chooses the urbane glamour of Trigorin and lives to regret it.With equally distinct performances from Forbes Masson as Dr Dorn, John Bett as Sorin and Steven McNicoll as Shamrayev, Brining’s production has a certainty that brings out Chekhov’s humour as much as his pathos. Played out amid the distressed grandeur of Colin Richmond’s set, the colour of straw as if drained of life, it loses some momentum in the closing confrontation between Konstantin and Nina, a relationship too deranged to be heartbreaking. Even so, this is a vibrant, flavoursome and sure-footed start to Brining’s tenure.AtRoyal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Lyceum theatreCaroline QuentinAnton ChekhovreviewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, he’s been consistently admired for his warm tone, effortless musical line and theatrical originality. His debut recital album continues that trend, but don’t expect the usual lineup of Handel arias or Dowland lute songs. On Refound, a collection of art songs with reinvention at its heart, his choices are eclectic, idiosyncratic even, but also profoundly satisfying.View image in fullscreenRefound by Hugh Cutting album artwork.Photograph: LinnConnections and parallels abound. Ravel’s reworkings of Greek folk song pair with Vaughan Williams’ Linden Lea, Dvořák’s Biblical Songs mirror Howells’ medieval carol setting, Come Sing and Dance. It’s Cutting’s plush yet flexible voice, however, that ties it all together. His handling of text, a willingness to go deep, and an impeccable musical sensitivity illuminate each song, from Piers Connor Kennedy’s wartime reflections to Tom Lehrer’s Poisoning Pigeons in the Park (sung here as a baritone).Audrey Hyland is a worthy partner throughout, whether cushioning the vocal line in French Melodies by Hahn and Bonis or bringing drama to Lieder by Wolf. Ending with the spoken word – a Schubert rarity for reciter and piano – is a surprise, but if Cutting has taught us anything by this point, it is to expect the unexpected.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The pricier of the two portable gaming devices dropping on 16 October, the all-black ROG Xbox Ally X will cost you a cool £799 (€899/$999/A$1599) to sample its splendour. (The less powerful ROG Xbox Ally, which comes in white, will run you £499/€599/$599/A$999.) Thankfully, the pricier option has said splendour in spades.I’ve put the ROG Xbox Ally X through its paces for the last few weeks, playing indie darlings and massive role-playing games throughout my apartment. Though the price tag is certainly a shocker (the Steam Deck OLED, a direct competitor, costs £479/€569/$549/A$899 for its cheaper model), the power packed into this comparatively smaller frame (291 x 122 x 51mm) is like nothing the portable gaming market has seen before.That power, coupled with its ability to play Xbox games through cloud gaming or its Play Anywhere initiative (where purchases and process carry between Xbox andPCplatforms), and PC games across various storefronts, makes it incredibly appealing to both Xbox loyalists and portable gaming fans alike. Though the ROG Xbox Ally X had a few hiccups during my time with it, and some user interface issues that interfered with performance, most of them were easily rectified and quickly forgotten once I was deep into playing a game.View image in fullscreenPlayable at home or on the go … ROG Xbox Ally X.Photograph: ROGSetting up the ROG Xbox Ally XSetting up the ROG Xbox Ally X isn’t frictionless. Though the device will launch into a dedicated full-screen Xbox experience that mimics both the Xbox console and PC app, it’s still a handheld running the Windows 11 operating system, and it needs an update before you can get going. This took a little time, and with all the pop-up notifications and steps of the standard Windows experience, it feels a bit odd for a gaming handheld.For the first day, despite adding my Xbox account immediately, the device told me that I didn’t have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – the upper tier of Microsoft’s gaming subscription service – and my attempts to re-link my account were in vain. The next day, it randomly worked. It also struggled to connect to my home wifi after waking from sleep mode – though weirdly, this also rectified itself after the first 24 hours.Once I got my various accounts connected (since this is a Windows handheld, you can also download PC game launchers like Steam, EpicGamesStore, and Blizzard’s Battle.net), the ROG Xbox Ally X ran pretty well.In a user friendly touch, it boots straight into the familiar Xbox user interface, but pulls games from the other game launchers, to ensure you can jump right into whatever you were just playing, no matter where it’s hosted.Thiscanbe an issue, however, if you’re playing say a Steam game, then jump back to the Xbox dedicated launcher and try to start a game through another storefront. The ROG Xbox Ally X doesn’t automatically close the last game you had open, or even ask you if you want to close it, which obviously kneecaps performance. And there were also a few moments where it kind of hung, suspended, in the Xbox interface and didn’t respond to any of my inputs.There was also a moment where the handheld slogged through a download of a rather beefy RPG, repeatedly losing connection whenever it would go idle, forcing me to resume the process manually. But after a reboot, it sailed through the rest of the file download without a hitch.View image in fullscreenSwitching between applications … ROG Xbox Ally X.Photograph: ROGROG Xbox Ally performanceThe above issues can hopefully be solved with a simple user interface (UI) update, because when it’s not being a bit finicky, the ROG Xbox Ally X performs incredibly well. There’s a bit of sluggishness when trying to boot up at low battery levels (sub-15%), but Supergiant Games’ beloved roguelike sequel,Hades II, launches fast and plays perfectly with no discernible load times between areas. Meatier games such asAvowedand PC mainstays like Backyard Baseball run smooth as butter, with beautiful frame rates and very little load times.Though the ROG Xbox Ally X doesn’t have an OLED screen, I’d be surprised if anyone really misses it. Games look incredible on its 7-inch, 1080p display. The glimmers and glints of Hades II’s mostly stationary characters are a visual feast; I let out a soft gasp when the moon goddess Selene first appeared, her pearlescent gown shimmering blue and sea-foam green.Xbox and Asus cleverly routed some system resources towards higher frame rates, and it pays off when playing a game as visually busy and punishing as Hades II–at no point am I so overwhelmed by what’s playing out that I can’t make sense of the battle at hand and act accordingly.The speakers are also fantastic for immersion. At one point in Hades II, I walked past the goddess of the hunt, Artemis, who was sitting in a moonlit glade quietly singing to herself. As I moved, her song emanated only from the left speaker, telling me she was still there behind me, even though I could no longer see her. Those kinds of beautiful details really shine.As for looks, the ROG Xbox Ally X may be initially odd – it’s like someone cut an Xbox controller in half and then soldered a screen between its grips – but the matt black finish is incredibly sleek, and the adjustable LEDs that ring the joysticks offer just the right amount of gamer-style finish.View image in fullscreenPowerful hardware … ROG Xbox Ally X.Photograph: ROGGaming on the go, or on the couchDuring my time with the ROG Xbox Ally X, I’ve played it lying prone in bed, propped up on the couch, leaning on the counter while waiting for pasta water to boil, and at my desk during writing breaks. After10 minutes of hands-on timethis summer, I wasn’t sure if the rather large handheld would be comfortable for me during longer sessions. But actually, holding it is comfortable even after a couple of hours of playtime. At 715g, though heavier than the less powerful ROG Xbox Ally (670g) and Steam Deck OLED (640g), the weight difference is negligible, especially because the controller-inspired grips are incredibly ergonomic. The only time I felt uncomfortable was after sitting with it held up above me on the couch with no elbow or wrist support; then, my pinkies got a little sore from holding its weight.The battery life is great (coming in at 80Wh, more than the ROG Xbox Ally’s 60Wh), considering what’s under the hood. I could play Hades II for two hours straight with no issue, including a run that lasted 20 minutes at 22%, which only dropped the battery to 10%. Although parts of the handheld got a little warm during especially long play sessions, it was never excessively hot.ROG Xbox Ally X’s game libraryAs for games, the device cleverly leverages the Xbox Play Anywhere initiative, which reflects Microsoft’s recent push for you to access its games, including a library of 1,000 purchasable Xbox and Xbox Game Pass subscription games across multiple devices, such as on PC, Xbox consoles, and now ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, with your progress intact.As someone who once owned a Steam Deck, and who has had an Xbox Game Pass for years, the ROG Xbox Ally X is my platonic ideal for a handheld console. I prefer the way Xbox controllers feel in my hands, and this device mimics that. I enjoy dipping into the Xbox Game Pass library to try out a new game, and this device lets me take that on the go – and if it’s a Play Anywhere title, which most games are, I also don’t need to worry about having internet access to enjoy it.If you’ve got the funds and are in the market for a powerful gaming handheld that can not only play PC games from a digital store of your choosing, but also an impressive suite of Xbox games, the ROG Xbox Ally X would be a good end of year splurge.The ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X is out today, October 16; £479-£799/$599-$999Explore more on these topicsGamesXboxHandheldPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m with Loreto to discover the food and wine culture of Spain’s Burgos province, a high-altitude area ringed by distant mountains. In summer the days are hot, and at night temperatures plummet. To thrive in these extremes, the food, the wine, and even perhaps the people, are robust and straight-talking.I’m staying deep in wine country at the ruralPosada de Pradoray, built as a hunting lodge for the Duke of Lerma in 1601. The thick stone walls, dark polished wood and heavy doors leading to simple rooms with vineyard views suggest little has changed in this landscape for centuries. Burgos is part of the Ribera del Duero wine region which stretches for 71 miles following the Duero River through the provinces of Burgos, Segovia, Soria and Valladolid.Map of northern Spain including the Ribera del Duero wine regionSince the appellation was recognised in 1982 the region has seen huge changes, with the number of wineries increasing from nine to more than 300. Now, there’s awine routeto help explore villages, wineries, restaurants and visitor experiences across the region, with plenty of sampling. My hotel is just outside Aranda de Duero, the main town in the region (population 33,000), 62 miles east of Valladolid and 102 miles north of Madrid. From here I’m following the river on day trips to get a taste of what’s on offer.View image in fullscreenAilsa Sheldon at Bodegas PortiaBodegas Portiais built on the edge of the tiny town of Gumiel de Izán, eight miles (13km) north of Aranda. Designed by Norman Foster, it’s one of the new wave of wineries in the region, with a futuristic trefoil shape, like a spaceship that’s landed in these sun-scorched fields. It’s built partly underground to meld into the landscape but also in recognition of the area’s unique winemaking traditions.Later, I meet the mayor of Gumiel de Izán, Jesús Briones, at his home – a tour with Loreto opens many doors, she knows everyone. “You’ve seen the wine cathedral [as local people refer to Portia], now see the caves,” he says. Jesús invites us into his garage from which, between tins of paint and boxes of faded Christmas decorations, stone steps twist underground. A single bulb illuminates a rough hewn cave full of barrels, dating back hundreds of years. Traditionally, wine in this region was made and stored in deep, hand-dug caves where the temperatures are stable.Jesús’s basement isn’t unusual: underneath these streets is a warren of caves, some used, some forgotten. Down here glasses are eschewed in favour of aporrón, a glass jug with a long, narrow spout designed for sharing wine. To drink from it is a leap of faith, pouring wine above your mouth, avoiding speckling your face and clothes with crimson Tempranillo and without the porrón touching your lips. I manage it (mostly).View image in fullscreenWine cellars at Moradillo de Roa.Photograph: Maria Galan/AlamyGumiel de Izán has seen a recent uptick in visitors thanks to a National Geographic article that notedvisual similaritiesbetween the baroque facade of the town’s Iglesia de Santa Maria, and “the treasury” rock-cut tomb in Petra, Jordan. Gazing up at the intricate sandstone carvings from the village square, I’d say here’s definitely a resemblance, and it’s helped to put the town on the map. “Anything that brings visitors,” says Jesús. “We need reasons for young people to stay.”‘It’s a real treasure’: Petra lookalike church draws crowds to Spanish townRead moreAtNabalwinery a few miles along the road I meet one young person who’s done just that: Luz Briones studied translation but became fascinated by wine in her early 20s. She leads us through vineyards ranging from 30 years old to more than a century. “We believe in the power of time,” Luz says. “Time in vineyards, time in barrels, time in bottles.” Grapes have to work hard here, developing thick skins to cope with temperature fluctuations and creating rich, tannic wines. In the storeroom, Benedictine chanting is played to the maturing barrels, an acknowledgment of centuries of wine-making by monks. Luz says security guards report lights and music turning on when the building is empty and shows us a large stain that has appeared on the wall resembling, if you squint, a monk drinking wine. The angels’ share perhaps?In summer fields of lavender and sunflowers create a colourful patchwork with the green of the grapesWe travel downstream, the Duero snaking just out of sight, its presence marked by rippling valleys covered in vines, all benefiting from the river’s proximity. Early in the year the land looks barren, with spiky bare vines and cracked red earth, but in summer fields of lavender and sunflowers create a colourful patchwork with the green of the grapes. In the village of Moradillo de Roa, south of Aranda, we meet Paola González Ortiz carrying a porrón. She’s part of a young team offering tours of a tiny winery museum, demonstrating the heavy labour and huge weights once needed to crush grapes. The village is famed for its grassy hillocks full of wine cellar entrances, often compared to Tolkien’s The Shire. Ducking low, I follow Paola down winding steps into the hillside (being Hobbit height would help). As we share wine from the porrón, a little light filtering through the air vents, Paola says she hopes increased tourism, whether for food and wine or scenic lookalikes, will help create more year-round jobs here. Moradillo de Roa has 157 wine cellars, and a population of 162. To attract young people, the village has started hosting porrón singles nights in the town square.View image in fullscreenIglesia de Santa Maria in the village of Gumiel de Izán.Photograph: Blanca Saenz de Castillo/AlamyI end my tour back in Aranda, with a final wine cellar, this one beneathDon Carlos wine shop. Through a dynamic tasting, Cristina López Nuñez tells stories of wine and winemakers, and why the region needs both traditions and youthful innovation. “It’s like wine. Younger grapes have more energy but fewer stories like children,” she says. “The older grapes have less energy but much better stories, like older people. The old vines with deep roots give complexity, the younger vines with shallow roots are juicy. We need both.”At dusk, everything changes as the bars switch from coffee to wineWhen I emerge back above ground, the sleepy town has transformed. Before I saw only old men sipping coffee and smoking at wine-barrel tables, and a gaggle of children chasing a football past the imposing gothic churches. At dusk, everything changes as the bars switch from coffee to wine. “We never entertain at home,” says Loreto. “Why would we?”AtEl Lagar de Isilla, the bar fills with people of all ages in office attire, hi-vis jackets, or dressed for a night out. We feast on bechamel-topped salt cod, gildas with fat olives and anchovies, and octopus cooked with potatoes and sweet paprika. The wine is cheap and delicious, straight from the restaurant’s own vineyard, and the atmosphere is lively. Loreto is satisfied: “I told you, it’s about eating and drinking – and who you share it with.” I can drink to that.The trip was provided by theRibera del Duero Wine Route.

Even before I was pouring wines in restaurants, taking orders and learning the table numbers, it was the first wine with which I became truly familiar. It was the black bottle with the white label that lined our supermarket shelves, and what people on the telly with expensive haircuts and thick resin bangles poured into large glasses.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Back then, Argentinian malbec was everywhere – and it still is. It has been a hero grape for Argentina since it was introduced to the country in 1868 by a French agronomist named Michel Pouget. Although vines have been cultivated in Argentina since the Spanish colonisation in the 1600s, originally to produce wine for mass, it was in 1853 that the president tasked Pouget with invigorating his nation’s winemaking.Pouget started a vine nursery in Mendoza, named Quinta Agronómica de Mendoza,where he cultivated the country’s first French grapes, including cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and, of course, malbec. Spanish and Italian immigrants brought with them their own native varieties, many of which took to the Argentinian climate, while the development of the cross-Andes Transandine railway allowed the export of wines to affluent Buenos Aires in one direction and an increase in immigrant workers from the big cities in the other.However, after a period of extreme economic instability in the 1980s, the Argentinian wine industry collapsed, with grape and wine prices dropping by 80% and domestic consumption plummeting. The story continues in a familiar way: the emphasis on quantity over quality contributed to Argentina developing a negative reputation as a bulk wine-producing country, a reputation it has shaken off only relatively recently.Malbec has played a huge part in the resurgence of Argentinian wine, but as a result it’s sometimes easy to forget about the country’s other wines. Bonarda, its second most-planted grape, is fruity and smooth, and often blended with other grapes to increase its complexity. Then there are other French varieties: cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon do well here, where high elevation brings a fresh yet ripe expression to both grapes. Elsewhere, criolla grande is also used as a blending grape or to produce inexpensive wine for the domestic market, but I am now seeing more single-variety bottles popping up, so maybe it’s a future “underrated gem” that’s ripe for a renaissance.As for Argentine whites, they tend to get overlooked altogether. There’s cereza, which, although a white variety, is pink-skinned (like pinot gris) and floral (like gewürztraminer); and chardonnay, which, when grown in cooler regions and at a high altitude, produces classy, mineral wines. And it would be remiss of me not to mention torrontés, a variety known for intense aromatics and grown throughout Argentina. It’s a cross betweenmuscat of alexandriaand mission grapes, which incidentally is the name given to the grape initially introduced to South America by Spain.Four Argentine wines that aren’t malbecDoña Paula Single Vineyard Gualtallary Chardonnay 2024£12.95 The Wine Society, 13%.

And then, in the case of one particular book, ordering another copy. Ten out, one in: not terrible.The book I (re)ordered wasBeaneaters and Bread Soup, by Lori de Mori and the photographer Jason Lowe. Gathered over decades of living just outside Florence, the book is a collection of wonderful, practical Tuscan recipes, and also tells a story of Tuscan food through portraits of photogenic local artisans: a chestnut grower, a bee keeper, a man who makes knives … I would mention more if I could find the book, which I suspect was borrowed and never returned – you know who you are! (Unless I have got this wrong and it is behind the bookcase.)One recipe I don’t need to wait for, though, is Lori’ssformato, which I have been making on and off for years. The word sformato means something taken out of a form, and it’s an umbrella term used to describe a great number of bakes. Lori’s consists of a layer of well-seasoned spinach covered with a duvet ofbesciamella(bechamel) seasoned with parmesan, and it inspired this week’s recipe, which is another good example of how so much cooking is simply repetitive behaviour seasoned with fresh thoughts.The fresh thoughts here are from a summer meal at a restaurant near Arezzo, where, as a vegetarian option, they baked leeks in individual terracotta dishes, poured over bechamel enriched with lots of cheese, then flashed the dishes under a grill. When I complimented the owner on the good idea, she mentioned that it works with spinach, too, and that you could also snuggle a few hard-boiled eggs into the vegetables for a more complete meal.One thing to note about this dish is that you want to cut the leeks into long lengths, then arrange them in a buttered dish – the effect is a bit like a cluster of standing logs or tree stumps. The leeks are then roasted alone to begin with, until very tender, and then the hard-boiled egg are added. If the bechamel is freshly made, the whole thing will need only five or so minutes in a hot oven, or under a grill.This is a dish that demands a salad, I think, with a vinegary dressing.Baked leek and egg gratinServes4 - 64 large leeks6 eggs50gbutter, plus extra for greasingOlive oil50g plain flour500mlwhole milkSalt and black pepperNutmeg, freshly grated, to taste50gparmesan, or cheddar or gruyereTrim the roots of the leeks, pull away and discard any damaged, tough or wayward leaves, then rinse the leeks in cold water as best you can without splitting them. Cut the leeks into 4cm-long logs and rinse again if any have dirt hidden in the exposed layers (again, make sure they don’t fall apart). Hard boil the eggs (I do this for eight minutes), then drain and peel.Arrange the leeks like standing logs in a buttered, roughly 25cm baking dish, packing them in quite closely. Spoon over five tablespoons of olive oil and six teaspoons of water, then cover the dish with foil and bake at 200C (180C)/390F/gas 6 for 30 minutes. Lift off the foil and bake for another 10 minutes, by which time the leeks should be tender and just a little golden. Pull the dish from the oven and keep warm.Melt the butter in a heavy-based pan, then, as soon as it starts to foam, whisk in the flour until it forms a paste and pull off the heat. Add a little of the milk, whisk to a smooth paste, then return the pan to the heat and add the remaining milk in a steady stream, whisking continuously, until it almost boils Season with salt, nutmeg and black pepper to taste, then lower the heat and simmer, stirring and whisking often, for about 10 minutes, until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in the cheese until melted and incorporated.Cut the hard-boiled eggs in half, then nestle them in between the baked leeks. Pour the bechamel over the top, then finish in a hot oven or under the grill until the top bubbles.Explore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodVegetablesEggsCheeseMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"
