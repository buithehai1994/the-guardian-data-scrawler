Everything is on the table in his conversation withVladimir Putinand [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy,” Hegseth told a press conference at the end of the meeting. “What he decides to allow and not allow is at the purview of the leader of the free world, of President Trump.”Trump unexpectedly announced on Wednesdayhe had spoken to Putinfor more than an hour and would begin peace talks with Russia and Ukraine, while Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine and the restoration of Crimea and other territories occupied by Moscow since 2014.On Thursday the US president repeated that he was convinced Putin “wants peace”. He also called for Russia’s return to the G7 group of industrialised nations, saying its expulsion was a mistake.Russia was suspended from the group – then the G8 – in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, and it announced its permanent withdrawal in 2017.Hegseth had also told allies the US was no longer “primarily focused” on European security.Map of UkraineThe Kremlin welcomed the developments on Ukraine, but the statements prompted a sharp push back from European politicians in public and private at theNatomeeting, who voiced concern that too much had been conceded by the US already and that Ukraine and Europe were at risk of being excluded from discussions.Zelenskyy warned world leaders “against trusting Putin’s claims of readiness to end the war” and said Kyiv could not accept as an independent country “any agreements without us”. He said he had been told by Trump on Wednesday, after the US president had spoken to Putin, that he wanted to speak to the Russian and Ukrainian leaders at the same time.1:05Zelenskyy says Ukraine won't accept any peace deal made by Trump and Putin alone – videoBut the Kremlin said Ukraine and Europe would be relegated to a parallel track in talks, and that Trump and Putin would meet in a few months, possibly in Saudi Arabia. “There will be a bilateral Russian-American track of this dialogue, and a track that will be related to Ukraine’s involvement,” said Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson.Hegseth was asked whether Europe should be prepared for the US to cut the 100,000 troop numbers it has deployed on the continent, and he appeared to link deployments to negotiations about Ukraine.“We have not said in any way we are abandoning our allies in Europe. There have been no decisions on troop levels, but that’s a discussion to be had by the commander-in-chief in these high-stakes negotiations,” Hegseth said.Russia did demand before the invasion in December 2021 that Nato cease all military activity in eastern Europe – and is still demanding that Ukraine cede further territory, reduce its army to a token level, and be prevented from joining the western military alliance in return for peace.About a sixth of Ukraine’s territory is occupied by Russia, including Crimea, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014, and large parts of the east and south that were mostly seized after the full-scale invasion in 2022. Kyiv’s leaders have signalled it may be willing to negotiate over territory, but Ukraine and its allies were formally committed to trying to restore its internationally recognised, pre-2014 borders.Map of Russian control in UkraineThose present at the Nato talks said Hegseth had come under pressure on Thursday from “a chorus of voices” to ensure Ukraine was properly represented in the peace discussions – while a day earlier at a Ukraine-related meeting he was told not to halt all US military aid to Ukraine.John Healey, the UK defence secretary, said Hegseth, a Fox News commentator, had sought to reassure allies that some degree of military aid would continue. “We know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are,” Hegseth said behind closed doors, according to Healey.The Kremlin also said it was impressed by the US positioning now that Trump had taken over the White House and that it believed there was “political will” on both sides to reach a negotiated settlement that was absent under Joe Biden.“The previous US administration held the view that everything needed to be done to keep the war going. The current administration, as far as we understand, adheres to the point of view that everything must be done to stop the war and for peace to prevail,” Peskov said.The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said Ukraine and Europe needed to be part of the peace discussions. “Any deal behind our backs will not work,” she said, and warned that too much had been conceded in public by the US.“Why are we giving them [Russia] everything that they want even before the negotiations have been started?” said Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister. “It’s appeasement. It has never worked.”The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, also complained that too much had been given away. “In my view it would have been better to speak about a possible Nato membership forUkraineor possible losses of territory at the negotiating table,” Pistorius said.The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister adept at smoothing over differences between Europe and Washington, said it was important Moscow understood that the west remained united, noting that Ukraine had never been promised that a peace deal would include Nato membership.The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, speaking in Berlin, said he believed the war must end but forcing a deal on Ukraine would not bring lasting peace. He said that while he supported Trump talking to Putin – and had done so himself in the past – the goal of such conversations was to make clear to the Russian leader “our expectations of a just peace in Ukraine and a return to a European security order in which borders cannot be changed by force”.He rejected “any solution that would lead to an uncoupling of European and American security”, saying that “only one person would profit from this – President Putin”.Closing the Nato meeting, Hegseth said he was committed to “make Nato great again” by demanding that other member countries lift their defence spending to 5% of GDP – which would require dramatic increases. The UK would have to more than double its existing spend of 2.33%.“The peace dividend has to end,” Hegseth said, though he refused to say if the US would increase its own defence spending from 3.4% of GDP. “3.4% is a very robust investment,” Hegseth said, but added: “Ultimately we have our own budgetary considerations.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS foreign policyPete HegsethDonald TrumpRussiaVladimir PutinEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

The number of people diagnosed with cancer has soared amid better awareness of symptoms, successful NHS initiatives to spot and treat cancer earlier, and a growing and ageing population.Macmillan, created 114 years ago, also plays a key role in NHS provision, funding 11,000 specialist cancer nurses and care workers, and providing specialist financial and emotional support to more than 130,000 people with cancer each year.The charity says the tough financial climate has forced it to make major cuts to its workforce and services to secure its “long-term financial sustainability”.In 2018, Macmillan’s board agreed to maintain spending on services despite flatlining income from donations. By regularly drawing on reserves over the next six years it was able to spend £100m more than it raised from the public and corporate sponsors.Although still one of the UK’s most successful fundraisers, by 2023 donations were failing to keep pace with rising costs and demand for cancer support. The last annual figures show its £232m income was dwarfed by £265m spending.Macmillan is also likely to face questions over its decision to axe its vital hardship grants scheme. It was introduced 100 years ago, when the charity – then the National Society for Cancer Relief – introduced handouts for medical fees, nursing care, clothing, artificial limbs and hot water bottles.The last annual figures show Macmillan distributed £17m via one-off £200 payments to low-income cancer patients to help them with transport costs for hospital visits or heating bills.The grants are means-tested – only households on very low incomes with savings of under £1,000 are eligible – and their value has shrunk in recent years from £350 to £200 as demand has soared.Macmillan says it will continue to support “the most vulnerable people with cancer” but has not specified how it will do so or who exactly would remain eligible for financial help in the future.The scheme is the UK’s only national cancer hardship fund, the Guardian found. Scrapping it will affect thousands of the country’s poorest cancer patients, at the same time as the UK experiences record levels of destitution and deep poverty.A breast cancer patient featured on Macmillan’s website, Laura, spoke of her “complete disbelief” when she was told she could get a £200 grant. “I cried so much but this time with happiness. I could pay my rent this month and be able to buy some oil for heating.”A second patient, Linda, diagnosed with breast and kidney cancer, said the grant enabled her to keep the heating on as she recovered from surgery. “Though I was signed off work on sick pay, it wasn’t enough to cover the higher costs of heating my home, so the grant really did make a difference.”Cuts to Macmillan’s helpline teams will see fewer phone operators and reductions in the level of specialist financial advice and emotional support they can give to callers.Sharp rise in cancer patients in England waiting months for treatmentRead moreMacmillan said that like many charities, it had felt the impact of the financial climate and had made changes to help refocus its resources, and to secure its long-term financial sustainability.The charity confirmed it had put 1,262 people at risk of redundancy, of whom 239 took voluntary redundancy and 174 were made redundant. A spokesperson said: “We had to make some very difficult decisions including reducing the size of our organisation by 26%.”Macmillan’s aim was to support more cancer patients, the spokesperson added. “To do that with less money and a smaller team, we must focus on developing the services which we can scale up to meet growing need. We’ve reviewed all of our services, including the grants we offer where demand far outweighs the funds we have, and made the difficult decision to close this offer.”The spokesperson added: “Throughout, we have tried to minimise disruption for people with cancer.” Macmillan was now in a “strong financial position to continue to offer vital support to people with cancer into the future”.Explore more on these topicsCharitiesCancerHealthVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

We already have so many,” Trump said. “You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.”“We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully, much more productive,” Trump said.While the US andRussiahave held massive stockpiles of weapons since the cold war, Trump predicted that China would catch up in their capability to exact nuclear devastation “within five or six years”.He said that if the weapons were ever called to use, “that’s going to be probably oblivion”.Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two countries once “we straighten it all out” in the Middle East and Ukraine.“One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi ofChina, President Putin of Russia. And I want to say: ‘Let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I think we’ll be able to.”Trump in his first term tried and failed to bring China into nuclear arms reduction talks when the US and Russia were negotiating an extension of a pact known as New Start.Russia suspended its participation in the treaty during the Biden administration, as the US and Russia continued on massive programs to extend the lifespans of or replace their cold war-era nuclear arsenals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite the scare, both returned to shore uninjured.Located about 1,600 miles (2,600km) south of Santiago, Chile’s capital, the Strait of Magellan is a major tourist attraction, known for adventure activities.Its frigid waters pose a challenge for sailors, swimmers and explorers who attempt to cross it in different ways.Although it’s summer in the southern hemisphere, temperatures in the region remain cool, with minimums dropping to 39F (4C) and highs rarely exceeding 68F (20C).While whale attacks on humans are extremely rare in Chilean waters, whale deaths from collisions with cargo ships have increased in recent years, and strandings have become a recurring issue in the last decade.Explore more on these topicsChileWhalesAmericasAnimalsMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

So far, Hamas has released 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages while Israel has freed about 730 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.Meanwhile, Israeli forces have pulled back to the periphery of the Gaza Strip. In the second phase of the ceasefire, the IDF is supposed to withdraw entirely from the territory and the remaining hostages are to be released along with hundreds more Palestinians held by Israel.Negotiations on the implementation of the second phase were due to begin last week, but so far Netanyahu has not empowered his negotiators to discuss that phase, which is intended to lead to the longer-term rebuilding of the territory.The prospect of a broader peace agreement was thrown into doubt by Trump’s shocking suggestion last week, welcomed by Netanyahu, that theUS would take possession of Gaza, and that its entire 2.2 million population would be transferred to neighbouring countries.The ceasefire deal, agreed only after nearly 46,000 Palestinians and 1,706 Israelis had died, looked in danger of collapse this week after the Hamas announcement on Monday that it would suspend hostage releases, drawing a rapid response from Trump. “As far as I’m concerned, if all of the hostages aren’t returned by Saturday 12 o’clock – I think it’s an appropriate time – I would say cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out,” the US president said on Monday night.Netanyahu and his government praised Trump’s hard line, but had been vague as to whether they would take his advice or stick to the agreed timetable.Egypt and Jordanhave said they will not accept the mass transfer of Palestinians from Gaza proposed by Trump. Egypt has called an emergency Arab summit on 27 February to discuss the situation and present a “comprehensive vision” for Gaza’s future. On avisit to Washington on Tuesday, Jordan’s King Abdullah also restated the consensus that Gaza should be rebuilt without the mass expulsion of its residents, and returned to Amman on Thursday to a hero’s welcome, with thousands lining the street in support of his stance.The flow of aid into Gaza has increased under the ceasefire but Israel has not allowed bulldozers and other construction equipment gathered on the Egyptian border with Gaza to cross into the Palestinian territory, saying that was not part of the ceasefire agreement.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaBenjamin NetanyahuUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Now a fast-growing business, it revealed plans last year to formally change its corporate structure.Musk and his own AI startup, xAI, and a consortium of investment firms want to acquire the non-profit’s controlling stake in the for-profit OpenAI subsidiary.OpenAI’s CEO,Sam Altman, quickly rejected the unsolicited bid in a post on social media and told questioners at a Paris summit on AI that the company is not for sale. The chair of OpenAI’s board, Bret Taylor, echoed those remarks at an event on Wednesday.Musk and Altman helped start OpenAI in 2015 and later competed over who should lead it before Musk resigned from the board in 2018. They have been in a long-running and bitter feud over the startup, with Musk suing, dropping his suit, and then suing again in 2024.Musk again criticized Altman’s management on Thursday during a video call to the World Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, describing it as akin to a non-profit aimed at saving the Amazon rainforest becoming a “lumber company that chops down the trees”. Altman has repeatedly countered that Musk’s legal challenges to OpenAI are motivated by his role as the founder of a competing startup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But due to a communication mix-up between the duty emergency registrar, Dr Rebecca McMillan, and nurses, the “life-saving” drug was not administered within the vital first hour of treatment, the inquest heard.Burns said her son only got the antibiotics after she warned Dr Luke Lake, the acting medical registrar on duty at the time, about the failure to administer the drug. In written evidence read to the court, she said: “I told him I didn’t think William had the antibiotics. Luke reassured me, that they had been written up earlier. I replied: ‘Yes, but they have not been given.’”Lake told the inquest he had realised earlier that the drug blunder had occurred after checking on Hewes’s chart. But questioning him, the family’s barrister, Neil Sheldon KC, said: “The reality is that Dr Burns did prompt you to question whether or not antibiotics had been given and it wasn’t something you queried independently.”Lake replied: “That’s not how I remember things. She may have chased. I can’t be crystal clear.”Earlier, McMillan recounted her distress when she realised at about 1.17am that the drug had not been administered by nurses as she requested.She said: “I do recall standing outside the resus room with [nurse Marianela Balatico] where she asked if I was OK and said that I looked really upset when I realised that antibiotics had not been given.“We had a conversation along the lines of we didn’t understand how this had happened. We were both upset when we realised that this hadn’t happened.”Fighting back tears, McMillan said one of the “learning points” from Hewes’s death was the need “to be clearer who I’m giving instruction to”. She added: “I obviously thought that my instructions had been clear enough. I have thought about that moment over and over.”The coroner, Mary Hassell, had relayed Balatico’s previous evidence to the court when the nurse admitted the instruction to give Hewes antibiotics had “slipped my mind” as she focused on relieving his symptoms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McMillan said she was concerned that she had to plead with Dr Mathuratha Sivasubramanian, the intensive care registrar responsible for admission, the court heard.Sivasubramanian advised continuing Hewes’s treatment in the emergency unit and waiting for further assessment before admitting him to intensive care.The coroner said: “It sounds like an argument.” McMillan replied: “She wasn’t behaving with the same urgency that I was conveying.”McMillan also said there was confusion between the three doctors over who was responsible for Hewes’s care. She said: “My worry is that I don’t think it was completely clear between the three of us who was keeping complete oversight and who had primacy for caring for William.”The inquest continues.Explore more on these topicsSepsisLondonHospitalsNHSEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

What I know about how the disciplinary system is supposed to work is, apology or not, that person should be removed from post while being investigated.”The assistant coroner Nicholas Rheinberg suggested to Young he appeared “incensed”. He replied: “100%.” He said: “I think that an apology letter shouldn’t even be offered in that situation. Why is that an acceptable outcome for that, especially with someone holding such a high rank?”Young said that when Beck told him about Mason’s behaviour towards her, which she considered“psychotic and possessive”, he encouraged her to report him.But he said: “She didn’t want to seem like that girl that was constantly putting in complaints. She was worried that she’d just be seen as causing drama. She loved the job – the biggest fear was being taken off the team. She was worrying they would just remove her from the situation rather than deal with the issue.”Bdr Braddon Haigh told the inquest that Beck had described the letter of apology from Webber as “pathetic”.“I saw it and briefly read it, and I just remember her saying it was pathetic, an easy win for him to write the letter,” he said.“That whole team clearly looked out for each other in a way that if someone comes with a service complaint it is just brushed under, write your letter, done and dusted. If she can’t come forward when there is solid evidence about a sergeant major what good is the system?”Webber appeared at the inquest on Wednesday and refused to answer questions about the alleged sexual assault.The hearing continues.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

In December, 66.4% of patients were treated within 62 days of urgent referral, up marginally from 64.5% in November.The target is to treat 85% of cancer patients within 62 days but this has not been met in any month since December 2015. Even if patients referred via screening or from their consultant are included, just under one-third of patients are still not treated on time.According to Cancer Research UK, the last time the NHS consistently met the target to treat 85% of cancer patients within two months of urgent referral was in 2013.Treatment starting within 62 days graphThe charity calculates that in 2024, 74,000 patients waited longer than 62 days to begin cancer treatment.One Cancer Voice, a coalition of more than 50 of the UK’s leading cancer charities, said the slow rate of improvement in treatment times was not good enough.The governmentrelaunched its cancer planin February but charities and experts said that without more funding it would fail.Cancer Research UK’s chief executive and One Cancer Voice representative, Michelle Mitchell, said: “The national cancer plan can be a turning point for cancer patients across England, but the UK government must invest in staff and equipment, alongside reforms, if it’s to hit all cancer waiting time targets by the end of this parliament. It’s the least that cancer patients deserve.”Treatment wait of more than 104 days graphThe NHS monthly data did show some improvements against cancer targets, with 78.1% of people receiving the all-clear or a definitive cancer diagnosis within 28 days of referral. The figures also revealed a 4% increase in urgent referrals of patients with suspected cancer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We cannot afford to celebrate the diagnosis of more cancer patients when so often these patients end up on huge waiting lists for treatment. Every four weeks of delay in treatment can increase the risk of death by 10% for some cancers.“While marginal improvements in the data are welcome, they cannot be allowed to mask the devastating crisis in cancer services. We need a monumental effort from the heart of government to turn this around.”NHS data also shows record numbers of patients waiting more than 12 hours in accident and emergency, while delays in discharging patients who were fit enough to leave hospital have also hit new highs.Prof Peter Johnson, the NHS national clinical director for cancer, said: “We know that too many people are waiting too long for cancer treatment, but thanks to the hard work of staff we have seen real improvement this year against all three standards – with a steady reduction in waiting times to start treatment and the faster diagnosis standard being met in eight of the last 10 months.“Although there is still much more to do to ensure patients receive a timely diagnosis and treatment, we are now seeing record numbers come forward for urgent checks – with suspected cancer referrals more than doubling in the last decade – and more people than ever are being diagnosed at an early stage, helping ensure that cancer survival has never been higher.”He added: “The NHS is fully committed to improving access to cancer care and last week we confirmed the faster diagnosis standard target is to be increased, to see around 100,000 more patients receive a diagnosis or the all-clear within four weeks next year.”Explore more on these topicsCancerNHSHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

And that has meant over the past 24 hours that some pronouncements by the British government have seemed at odds with reality.In the real world, we have just seen the US president make extraordinary concessionsin a call with the Russian president– no return to pre-2014 borders and a dismissal of Ukraine’s hopes of joining Nato.The response by British ministers is then to say that of course Trump is right to want peace inUkraine, but the priority is “putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position”.That makes very little sense just hours after Ukraine’s position was so undermined by Trump’s decision to engage with Putin directly on the terms of a possible peace deal.Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said there could be “no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine”. But that is what the US president has just done.1:05Zelenskyy says Ukraine won't accept any peace deal made by Trump and Putin alone – videoOfficials told journalists that Ukraine was definitely on a path to Nato membership – and that has been agreed by all Nato members including the US. “Nato has made a long-term commitment to Ukraine and its rightful place is in Nato,” Starmer’s spokesperson said.But again, just a few hours ago, the president had said that no longer applied. The words from his defence secretary are there in black and white. “The United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,” Pete Hegseth said.At a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels on Thursday, the UK’s John Healey and Hegseth were sat on the same table but merrily existing in parallel universes.Hegseth said the US no longer “primarily focused” on Europe’s security, an extraordinary moment which if it bears out may be the most consequential shift in US foreign policy since 1945. European leaders just smiled and pretended he had not said what he just said.Some might say this is nothing new. Leaders are adept at saying one thing in public and another in private. Sometimes it is necessary to continue to insist that black is white.There will be many European officials who agree privately that Nato membership for Ukraine is difficult, but are prepared to keep saying publicly that it is possible and insisting their US counterparts still agree that it is.And of course reality is being confronted behind the scenes in Brussels. There are now frantic efforts to make sure that Washington understands that no summit between Trump and Putin can go ahead and that the next step must be to fully involve Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIt is also true that the sound and fury that emits from the White House does not always translate into reality. Even Hegseth’s speech was considerably toned down from a draft briefed to the press in advance.EU failed to Trump-proof Europe and now faces humiliation over UkraineRead moreBut Trump is unique among many world leaders because he does not play by the rules of private versus public. He is fully prepared to just agree something in a phone call with Putin and then post about it on Truth Social.Speaking at his press conference, Hegseth said starkly that the terms Trump laid out to Putin were just the reality of the situation, and that he was not prepared to pretend that they were not.All of this is quietly having an effect in Europe. That plain talking on security guarantees – that the US will not send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine – means European nations must now start to talk in realistic terms about what that implies for them.Starmer has a finer line to tread than most. He knows that he must keep his distance from European leaders when it comes to Trump. Many of the US president’s advisers see him as a dangerous lefty, but Trump himself seems won over by Starmer’s charm offensive so far, which may protect Britain from the worst of his plans for tariffs on the EU.If he is able to successfully straddle loyalties on both sides of the Atlantic, Starmer can be a useful bridge from Europe to Washington. It may even put him in the best position to help Ukraine.

For the best part of a decade I’ve had very short hair. It’s convenient, easy to maintain and I genuinely like a slightly androgynous look – always have done. In the past year I’ve dyed it a variety of colours (purple, red and orange) as it grows out quickly. My short hair also reveals another aspect about me: I wear hearing aids. I don’t care about strangers knowing about my deafness. If folks can easily see my hearing aids, it means I don’t have to “out” myself to every new person I meet.It only concerns me at the moment as I would like to consider applying for a new job. Appearing “other” and deaf are not necessarily assets to have when entering this market. When I was previously job hunting I had longer hair and better hearing. The field I work in currently is quite conservative and male-dominated. Should I modify my appearance to fit in and be conventional, or will being true to myself work to my advantage in the long run?Eleanor says:Two things we know: appearances shouldn’t matter; your hair cut or colour is not an indication of talent and it’s downright illegal to treat your hearing aid as one. But appearances often do matter. Every aesthetic choice tells people how to read us, even the choice to avoid aesthetic choices.I want to find my ‘thing’. How can I work out what I want to do with my life? | Leading questionsRead moreI wish I could just say: “Be you! Whittle too much of yourself down and there won’t be any left.” But you’re right that standing out can cost you opportunities, or get you cast as the “alternative” one. Some places are so hidebound that the audacity of an interesting sock is enough to make you Seriously Counter-Cultural. I know a man who missed out on a job because he has a knuckle tattoo. Without knowing more about your field or career chances, I can’t just say, “Be the change you want to see” – as much as I wish we all would.I think the better question is where you want to draw the line. Most of us are not our complete selves at work. But that’s not always a bad thing. Sometimes a work mode lets you experience versions of yourself you don’t experience elsewhere, and leaving some parts of yourself behind is how you get that. Sometimes people are able to be more professional, more direct, less compelled to shrink away, or just more task-oriented, more absorbed in something. Many people have facets of themselves they only step into fully at work. That wouldn’t happen if we were all expected to be our full normal selves at work. Leaving the personal life or the jokes or the floppy T-shirts at home is strictly speaking a way of changing ourselves to fit in, but it’s a change that lets us access a version of ourselves we value being. Sometimes setting aside certain parts of yourself lets you more fully inhabit the others.At other times, though, setting aside parts of yourself just feels like capitulation. Deep values, hard-won parts of our personality or self-presentation: some stuff feels awful to set aside for other people’s sake, even if only temporarily.I think the question is: would growing your hair out and covering your hearing aids make you feel like a version of yourself, or less like yourself? Would it make you feel like you’re controlling the impression you make or being controlled by it?Nobody should expect that who you are at work represents all of who you are. You shouldn’t think that of yourself, either. It’s OK to make changes that will make your life easier. Equally, some changes don’t make life easier – they make it smaller. If that’s the kind of choice you’re being offered, then it isn’t you who needs to change.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsBody imageLeading questionsAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Get as much as you can for yourself. There’s always someone out there who’s stupider than you. Any attention is better than none. Promise people the Earth even if you know you can never deliver. Paint yourself orange and glue what’s left of your hair to your head. This is business as a macho willy waving contest. So much so you suspect The Donald is deeply insecure about the size of his own.But maybe we should have read between the lines better. For the real message is: “Always let someone else take the hit.” After all, it wasn’t Trump who was left out of pocket when his hotels and casinos six times filed for bankruptcy between 1991 and 2009 due to an inability to meet scheduled payments. It was his creditors. That’s a business style The Donald has taken into his presidency. After the Trump Plaza and the Trump Tower, we now have the Trump Toilet. To flush awayUkraine.Trump promised to deliverpeace to Ukraineon day one of his presidency, but it took him until now to come up with a plan. Not a lot of thinking appears to have gone on in the past three weeks. Almost as if The Donald had been winging it all along. Who would have guessed? How very unlike him.It was late on Tuesday night that Trump announced he had had aone-hour phone call with Vladimir Putin. For The Donald this was a “peace in our time” moment. His legendary negotiating tactics forcing the Russian president to his knees. Perhaps not. Because far from demanding the impossible to get as much as he could, Trump gave away almost everything in the first round of talks.Here was the deal. Ukraine was to have no say in the future of Ukraine. Russia would get to keep all the land it had annexed since 2014. Ukraine would never be part of Nato or subject to Nato protections. The US would play no part in maintaining the subsequent peace. This was geopolitics as a real-estate deal. Who cared about Crimea and the Donbass anyway? They weren’t great locations for golf courses and casinos like Gaza.Putin could barely contain himself. The negotiations had taken barely a couple of minutes. All he had had to do was say yes to everything. The remaining 58 minutes of the conversation were spent telling The Donald how brilliant he was.“You’re a genius,” said Vlad. “The world is going to be so much safer now you are in the White House. Together we’re going to carve up the world.”“A lot of people say that to me,” Trump replied. “You won’t believe how much peace I am going to bring. The bigliest amount of peace the world has ever seen. I tell you, everyone is going to be so grateful to me. Some are calling me the Messiah.”Over in the UK, you could hear the sense of despair in government circles. Not another mind-blowingly unhelpful intervention from the US president that some poor minister would simultaneously have to defend and disown? Labour’s insistence on doing nothing that might upset The Donald at all costs must be maintained at all costs. Whatever you do, don’t call the president stupid. Especially when he is being stupid.With the defence secretary, John Healey, away in Brussels, the poor person left to explain the government’s position on Ukraine to the Commons was the junior defence minister Maria Eagle. Understandably, she looked nervous and miserable throughout. This was so far above her pay grade. She looked down at her briefing notes and willed the 45 minutes of the urgent question tabled by the shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge, to race by.Maria began by insisting that Ukraine had a right to decide on its own peace terms.

Then came the obligatory praise for the US. Trump had been right to realise there was a war taking place that needed to come to an end. No one else had noticed the war was ongoing. It had been an act of strategic brilliance for The Donald to pick up the phone to Putin. She also wanted to congratulate the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, on being Pete Hegseth. No one could have been a better Pete Hegseth than Pete Hegseth. And when he said Ukraine should have no say in its own future, what he really meant was Ukraine should be cut into the loop.You sense there is a vein of ice-cold sadism running through Cartlidge. Why else would he have demanded this UQ? He had nothing different to say to Eagle. Every party defends Ukraine’s right to agree to the terms of any peace. He just wanted to see her squirm as she mangled her words of praise for the US. For once, James also breathed a sigh of relief he wasn’t in government. There but for the grace of God … No one cares about inconsistencies in Tory policy these days so no one raised an eyebrow when he said we should be backing Europe after months of saying we should cosy up to the US.There weren’t many MPs in the Commons for the UQ – though Rishi Sunak did make a rare guest appearance – but they all spoke with one voice. The US couldn’t dictate terms to Ukraine. Especially not the ones Trump had come up with. That was an admission that aggression always paid off. An incitement for Putin to have another go at taking Kyiv in a few years. This wasn’t a peace that could last. The Tory Julian Lewis was outraged that the US was calling the shots when it wasn’t even prepared to hang around to make the peace work. It was appeasement plain and simple.The longer it went on, the more unhappy Eagle became. Part of her was dying inside having to defend any part of this American intervention. Dealing with Trump is like wrangling a toddler. First it drains you of your self-worth. Then your will to live.Explore more on these topicsLabourThe politics sketchUkraineDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps a head-to-toe new season wardrobe from Zara? Enough knitwear to see you through several winters, or maybe a lifetime supply of socks from Marks & Spencer?Whatever you decide, you’d need to factor in the cost of a taxi to lug all those bags back from the shops. Or at least, once upon a time you would. These days, a grand is easy to spend on a single item – and it’s all thanks to the rise of the four-figure coat.View image in fullscreenA funnel-neck shearling coat, on sale at Cos for £1,190.Photograph: CosOuterwear with outsized prices have emerged as a firm fixture on the high street in recent years. Arket is selling abiscuit-coloured shearling coat for £1,299, while its sister brand Cos, which is also owned by the H&M Group, has afunnel-neck shearling coat for £1,190and a leather and wool coat for £1,000. At Whistles, a mid-length shearlingcoat costs £1,499.NowJohn Lewis, the British department store that prides itself on competitive pricing, and its “never knowingly undersold” pledge,has joined the trend. The forthcoming spring collection includes a gabardine cotton trenchcoat by S S Daley which retails at a steep £1,475.S S Daley is one of 49 new brands John Lewis is adding to its fashion roster for spring. Steven Stokey Daley, who launched his eponymous brand in 2020 is now backed by the pop star Harry Styles. His price points are more typical for a catwalk brand – about £500 for a jumper, or indeed a trench sneaking in at just under £1,500.If Daley is an exception at John Lewis, prices in general are rising on the high street. This correlates to price hikes in the luxury sector, too. A classic Chanel 2.55 flap bag cost £2,500 in 2019. It now retails for £8,850.View image in fullscreenA shearling coat on sale at Arket for £1,299.Photograph: ArketSome high street brands are attempting to recast themselves as mid-tier luxury labels. In 2022, Cos launched its diffusion line, Cos Atelier, during New York fashion week with prices typically double that of the main line, while last year Zara collaborated with Kate Moss on a capsule collection that included a leather jacket costing £699.Graeme Moran, the associate editor of the retail industry magazine Drapers, says four-figure coats are the next step in these brands changing how they are perceived. “Many of these retailers are, or at least would like to be, seen as more ‘luxe’ brands at the premium end of the UK high street and are keen to create an air of luxury online or in store. Sprinkling four-figure statement coats among their somewhat more affordable assortments certainly works to elevate the offering.”John Lewis has credited a bounceback in footfall and consumer confidence as the factor driving its mid- to premium-pricing strategy. While Daley, the designer behind John Lewis’s four-figure trench, prides himself on a commitment to craft and upcycling, with many of his pieces made in the UK, the same cannot be said for other high street brands. While shearling and leather typically demand higher prices, there is often a lack of transparency around sourcing and production.Jane Shepherdson, the former brand director of Topshop and the ex-CEO of Whistles, says high prices don’t always equate to higher quality. “Increased margins play a huge part but the sad thing is that none of it is actually going to the producers. It’s mainly lining the pockets of the people that own the companies.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I had no idea it had killed my fatherLaurence Marks was a 25-year-old journalist when he was asked to cover the biggest catastrophe in the City of London since the blitz. That day would change his life foreverLaurence MarksThu 13 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 07.08 ESTShareFriday 28 February 1975 was the day that changed my life. At half past eight that morning, I was sitting down to write a newspaper feature. At 9.35am, I was standing in the press enclosure outside Moorgate station.I was 25 years young, a freelance journalist who covered occasional news stories for a Fleet Street agency, but I had never been sent to report on one quite like the Moorgate train disaster. My brief was simple: find out what, who, when and how. We knew the “where”, and when I arrived there were just 10 journalists cordoned off next to the underground station entrance. Half an hour later came the first of the day’s many press conferences. I had my shorthand notebook at the ready.“Good morning. I am Brian Fisher, head of disaster planning for the City ofLondonpolice. At 08:46 today there was a major incident, when the three front carriages of an underground train telescoped into a short dead-end tunnel. The front two carriages were forced upwards on impact and the driver’s cab is embedded in the tunnel roof. We believe there may be up to 40 people trapped in the train …”I remained at Moorgate station, and at Barts hospital, interviewing the injured, until just after lunchtime and then filed my copy from a telephone box. I was told by the on-duty editor I had done well and should now go home and send in my invoice. I wanted to remain on the assignment, but I realised that this was turning into a major story and a more senior reporter would take over from me. What I had no idea of, as I was filing my copy, was that 60ft beneath the pavement at Moorgate station lay my own father. He was killed instantly as the train hit the concrete wall.View image in fullscreenThe scene of the Moorgate rail disaster.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesMy dad, a 68-year-old ex-copper, was on his way to work at Liverpool Street station that morning. Had he been able to find a parking space near Finsbury Park station, where he dropped off his wife (my stepmother), he would have taken the Piccadilly line from there, then changed on to the Central line to Liverpool Street. But there were no parking spaces, so he went to nearby Drayton Park station, to change at Moorgate station to Liverpool Street. The lack of parking spaces at Finsbury Park cost him his life.The Moorgate train crash was to become the biggest City of London disaster since the blitz: 43 people died and nearly 80 were seriously injured. By 4pm on the afternoon of the accident, more than 100 reporters, photographers and film crews from all over the world were squeezed in and around the narrow station entrance.My father, being Jewish, was the first victim to be buried, a day after his body was removed from inside the twisted second carriage. At the gates of the cemetery on that freezing cold Sunday morning were many reporters and film crews, and I was charged with asking them to respect my family’s and the mourners’ privacy – explaining that I, too, was a journalist and this really was a very heart-rending moment for me. They respected my wishes, and one, from the Sunday Times, must have noted my words and passed them back to his editor.Five days later I was recruited by the legendary Insight investigative section of the Sunday Times, under the leadership of Harry Evans. Why would such an august newspaper recruit a novice? Because it was Evans’s belief that the relatives of the deceased, the transport secretary, the coroner, the police – indeed, everyone involved in the disaster and its aftermath – was more likely to speak to a journalist whose father had been a victim.View image in fullscreenThe injured are carried out into ambulances.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyEvans’s hunch was correct. My grief opened the doors of offices and homes that would have otherwise closed in my face. I knew it was going to be challenging, though. Was it possible to separate my mourning from a deep investigation into the cause of the crash? It soon became apparent to me that confusing the personal and professional would prevent me from grasping this God-given opportunity properly. And so I found I was able to leave home each morning and leave behind me the photograph I had of my dad. He belonged in my council flat, and I belonged in the world of investigative reporting.For the next 50 weeks I interviewed every major player in the disaster, every family who lost a loved one, even some conspiracy theorists – yes, even half a century ago. I had access I couldn’t have believed. With the words, “This is Laurence Marks, Insight, the Sunday Times”, officials that were “unavailable”, “on holiday this week” or “in a meeting” suddenly arrived pretty damn quickly on the other end of the phone. Everyone, that is, except London Transport, who were intent on not becoming involved lest compensation claims started piling up on their desks. In the event, there was just a small handful of inquiries about claims, and, as far as I can recall, only one payout.I attended the coroner’s inquest six weeks after the disaster and for three days listened to all the evidence. Dr David Paul, the City of London coroner, offered the jury four possible conclusions as to the driver’s role in causing the crash: manslaughter; accidental death; suicide; and an open verdict. The jury returned accidental death, but in a private interview with Dr Paul weeks later, he confided in me that I should pursue the line of suicide. He felt that the evidence pointed to it, but without a note he couldn’t have led the jury in that direction.The interview I wanted beyond all others (as did every journalist) was with the driver’s widow, Helen Newson. I had written to her on more than one occasion and, unsurprisingly, never received a reply. But a week before my Moorgate storywent to print, I took a gamble. I drove over to the south-east London block of council flats where the Newson family lived, and delivered a handwritten note explaining how much I desperately wanted to talk to them, and that I would be sitting downstairs in my car.View image in fullscreenLeslie Newson, the driver of the train that crashed.Photograph: PAForty-five minutes later there was a tap on my window, and there stood a young woman saying that her mum would like to talk to me. As a journalist I received vital details nobody else had, but Mrs Newson could offer no more idea of what had overcome her husband than I could, and her pain was evident in her eyes. She kept apologising to me for her husband’s actions, and I kept telling her it wasn’t her fault and there was nothing she should be sorry for.When I wrote my Insight feature, it was headlined: “Was It Suicide?” The answer is, we shall never know. The driver didn’t leave a note, so there was no evidence. London Transport’s chief engineer told me the train that crashed was in perfect working order, and had the driver applied the brakes at any time it would have slowed down and stopped. The engineer added: “The driver stopped the train at every station quite normally that morning, except at Moorgate. He could have done and didn’t.”I spent days with the eminent pathologist Prof Keith Simpson, who took me through the postmortem performed on the driver. He concluded that there was simply no condition that could be discovered that would have prevented the driver from letting go of the “deadman’s handle” (the spring-loaded brake). Prof Simpson was unwavering in his professional opinion that the driver had not suffered a stroke, heart attack, gone blind, undergone an epileptic seizure or been electrocuted. He simply did not apply his brakes. What’s more, he increased the acceleration of the train as he shot into the daylight of Moorgate station.‘Perhaps,’ said one psychiatrist, ‘you’re using comedy to blank out the tragedy’When my feature was published, in certain quarters I was castigated for even suggesting that the drivermayhave taken his life and the lives of others. I felt it was now time for me to step aside and let the entire matter rest in peace. Yes, I had lost my father, but nothing I could now write – and I was offered appearances on TV, radio and even a publishing contract to write a book on the subject – would bring him back. My year-long investigation elevated me up the journalistic ladder and there I thought my future lay. I worked for national newspapers and the ITV current affairs programme This Week. I could be excused for believing that my career was on an upward trajectory and that perhaps I might even become a “front of camera” television reporter.But comedy stood in the way of that dream.For years I had been secretly writing comedy sketches and half-hour situation comedies – all rejected, but very encouragingly. In 1977, my co-writer, Maurice Gran, and I were commissioned to write the Frankie Howerd Variety Show, thus kicking off a career in television comedy, creating shows such as The New Statesman, Goodnight Sweetheart, Shine on Harvey Moon and Birds of a Feather. “Perhaps,” said one psychiatrist to me, “you are using comedy to blank out the tragedy that was the Moorgate train disaster.” Who was to gainsay her? Whatever the reason, my comedy career skyrocketed and Moorgate faded into the background of my life and imagination.View image in fullscreenFiremen working inside the wreckage.Photograph: PAI was the subject of a 2006 Channel 4 documentary entitled Me, My Dad, and Moorgate, which was more focused on my television career than on the disaster, after which those dusty old Moorgate files were placed in my university archive. It was in 2023 that Maurice tentatively suggested that I should blow the dust off the mountain of old research documents and perhaps write a drama about that life-changing day in February 1975. My initial reaction was: “Why would I want to relive the pain of losing my dad in a 65ft-long train carriage that was reduced to just 15ft?” Maurice and our manager put up a very good argument and, when I finally agreed, the next question was: for what medium would we write it? After significant discussion, we opted for radio.Maurice and I decided to tell the story of Friday 28 February 1975 in two parts: first from the point of view of the rescue operation outsidethe wreckage; and in our second play from insidethe front carriage, focusing on the last two survivors, who were trapped for 12 hours. Out came my considerable library, the cassette-recorded interviews, the shorthand notes, the papers and other documents I should never have been given in the first place. From these we put together the content of the two 45-minute plays, which will be broadcast on Radio 4 later this month.View image in fullscreenThe memorial to the 43 people killed in the crash, in Finsbury Square, close to Moorgate station.Photograph: Louis Berk/AlamyThe two plays were constructed and written in 2023, then revised last year when more information was brought to our notice from those who had read about the project on social media. Ambulance workers, doctors, firefighters, and London Transport engineers came out of the woodwork to tell me about their involvement. It was all treasured; it heightened our drama and transported me back 50 years to Moorgate station’s press enclosure.As I reflect today on the young me – the journalist who, it might be said, found his professional feet and lost his dad – I ask myself, would I have done it all again? Without question I would. I was ambitious and, furthermore, I cannot see how anything I did was wrong. In so many ways it served as a form of grief therapy. Each day I discovered a new fact, both about my dad’s life and what actually occurred on the train that morning.Whereas I felt better about my published piece and the process that led me to write it, this certainly wasn’t the case with Helen Newson, whose family were appalled at my suggestion that her husband, her daughters’ father, mayhave died by suicide. Other relatives of the deceased were divided; many thanked me for taking the trouble to discover just how their loved ones were killed, others were appalled that I was digging into their private pain.From the archive, 1 March 1975: Maverick train’s ride to deathRead moreHow do I feel about returning to the past? It was creepy revisiting the young me, hearing him interview such eminent players in the drama (now almost all dead), and reviewing my theory about what happened on that morning in 1975. Yet, had the train arrived as it usually did at Moorgate station, and had all the passengers, including my father, stepped from the carriages and gone about their daily business, I can say with some sureness that my life wouldn’t have turned out as it did.Moorgate will be broadcast onRadio 4 on 26 and 27 February, and willbe availableonBBC Sounds.Explore more on these topicsTrain crashesFamilyLondonRail industryNewspapersThe TimesNewspapers & magazinesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He would be unlikely to endorse the warty portrait of his political idol in Howard Brenton’sChurchill in Moscow. And now, in The Autobiography of a Cad, an egotistical, Shakespeare-quoting, wildly reproductive Old Etonian and Oxonian Tory looks back on a public life in memoirs that prove to be unreliable and self-serving.Some relief for the former prime minister is that Edward Fox-Ingleby becomes a broader portrait of privileged chancers in English public life. He gives a Sunak-like oration in a downpour, lounges on a Commons bench in the Rees-Mogg manner, suffers David Cameron and Liz Truss’s overconfidence about their political nous, leans towards the biographical inaccuracy of Jeffrey Archer and shares Prince Andrew’s appetite for shooting weekends (though not pizza).However, this adaptation by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman of a 1939 novel by the Scottish author AG Macdonell faces the problem that drama typically forces a protagonist towards a moment of shame or self-knowledge, neither of which these sorts possess. (Johnson’s autobiography Unleashed has the same problem.) At least in the play, there is counterpoint to the torrential self-justification. Hislop and Newman, as alumni of Private Eye, are well-placed to challenge Fox-Ingleby with satisfying satire of precisely how he keeps getting away with it, through manipulation of the British political and media establishments.View image in fullscreenConfidence trick … Rhiannon Neads, James Mack and Mitesh Soni.In the colossal title role – in effect, a two-hour interrupted monologue – James Mack can’t quite solve the mystery of how such a chap gets so much money and sex but suggests how the confidence trick might work.

She impresses as an alarming aunt and he as a college enemy who, in an Anthony Powell-ish way, haunts the rotter’s rise.Macdonell’s England, Their England – which Tom Stoppard identified as a key book in his happy Anglicisation as a Czech immigrant – gently sends up the best of the country, such as cricket.

Still, as long as I’m forced to share roads with unpredictable lumps of metal travelling at four times my speed, I choose to illuminate myself like a Christmas tree.Improved visibility isn’t the only perk – bike lights can also extend your riding hours in the dark winter months. But with hundreds of options and lots of confusing tech jargon, finding the right ones is no small feat. So I’ve tested a selection of bike lights and compiled a list of my favourites below.

I rack up thousands of miles every year, and when I’m not riding bikes, I’m writing about them. I’m a self-confessed gear junkie who’s always on the lookout for anything that might improve my riding experience, which, over the years, has seen me testing all manner ofcycling kit, equipment and tech.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I tested a total of 20 front and rear lights.’Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianSince becoming a parent, my leisure time is usually confined to a small window between 4am and 6am. This often means I’m riding in the dark, which puts me in an excellent position to test bike lights.I tested a total of 20 front and rear lights, both on unlit roads in the wee hours of the morning and after the sun had risen. This allowed me to assess suitability for riding in night-time conditions and in daylight. Decent battery life is crucial, so I ran the lights at full power until they died, making a note of how long they lasted. Once all of this was done, I whittled it down to seven favourites, including three top picks.I returned the bike lights where possible. Any that couldn’t be returned are being donated toRecyke y’bike, a charity local to me in the north-east that refurbishes used bikes and donates them to schools, community groups and people on very low incomes living in the area.The best front and rear bike lights in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Performs above and beyond its relatively modest price tag’: the Ravemen CR450.Bestfront bike light:Knog Blinder Pro 900View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mark PinderIf you’re looking for a one-stop-shop front light that’s bright, robust and easy to use, it doesn’t get much better than the Knog Blinder Pro. This aluminium option is built to take a beating, with USB-C charging, a generous run time, and six lighting modes.Why we love itIn the three months I’ve spent putting various front bike lights through their paces, I often found myself hankering for the Knog Blinder Pro 900. From the fuss-free mounting clip to the USB-C compatibility, everything about it just works. And while the maximum output of 900 lumens may be insufficient for racing through dark woodland, I found it to be more than enough for riding on unlit country lanes in the dead of night. The beam pattern provides a wide spread up to 100m, angled to avoid dazzling oncoming traffic.Knog Blinder demoOur writer testing the Knog Blinder Pro 900.The silicone finish on the one and only button means it’s easy to locate, even with a gloved hand, and the tactile click makes it easy to cycle through the various light modes, turn the device on and off and check the battery level. When turned off, the light will remember what mode it’s in.The Blinder’s clever fixed U-shaped mount secures the light in the perfect position and makes it a breeze to detach from the bike for charging.It’s a shame that …there’s no USB-C charging cable supplied.Light type:frontRechargeable battery:yes, USB-C cable (not supplied)Maximum output:900 lumensIP rating:IP67Modes:6Full-beam run time:2hrs£52.09 at Fawkes Cycles£54.90 at AmazonBest value front bike light:Ravemen CR450View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mark PinderLight, compact and affordable, this cylindrical light from Ravemen may not be the brightest of the bunch, but it’s long lasting, practical and perfect for urban cycling and commuting in the dark.Why we love itThe CR450 is a solid little light that performs above and beyond its relatively modest price tag. The rubber strap is easy to mount on most handlebars (those with super fancy aero bars may struggle), and there’s a handy release clip mechanism that allows the light to be quickly removed from the bike for charging.There’s also a remote switch that can be attached within thumb’s reach, allowing you to change through six light settings without taking your hands off the bar. Among those settings are a nice bright pulse flash for daytime visibility and a max power mode that casts out 450 lumens in a T-shaped anti-glare beam.Ravemen CR450 demoOur writer testing the Ravemen CR450.It’s a shame that …it only runs for approximately 1hr 30mins on max power, and there’s no side visibility.Light type: frontRechargeable battery:yes, USB-C cable (supplied)Maximum output:450 lumensIP rating:IPX6Modes:6Full-beam runtime:1hrs 30mins£32.99 at Merlin Cycles£36 at TredzBest rear bike light:Garmin Varia RTL515View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mark PinderI was sceptical of Garmin’s Varia rear light. A built-in radar? Seriously? Surely that was something I could live without. How wrong I was. In five years, it has rarely left my bike, and on the odd occasion that I have left it at home, I feel as if I’m missing a limb.Why we love itPeace of mind is valuable when cycling on busy roads and the Varia delivers it. The light itself is fantastic, offering visibility from the back and sides, but the real star of the show is the radar system that alerts you to approaching objects. The unit pairs wirelessly, either with aGarmin cycling computeror a smartphone. It then uses the display to show you vehicles approaching from behind, giving you a rough idea of their speed and proximity. It’s no substitute for having your wits about you, but it’s certainly a useful tool.The Varia sits on the seat post using a rubber band, a small plastic quarter-turn mount and one of three rubber bungs supplied to accommodate different seat post shapes and sizes. It can be removed from the mount quickly with a firm twist for charging. Battery life is good at about 16 hours in day-flash mode, and it can automatically switch light settings based on ambient light – handy for boosting visibility when vehicles approach.It’s a shame that …it’s a tad bulkier than standard rear lights and considerably more expensive too.Light type:rearRechargeable battery:yes, micro-USB cable (supplied)Maximum output:65 lumensIP rating:IPX7Modes:4Full-beam run time:6hrs£114.99 at Decathlon£169.99 at GarminThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Klubovy/Getty ImagesBookman Volume 800View image in fullscreenBest for:effortless operationI thought long and hard about whether to include the Volume 800 in my top picks. Its USP is that it has a chunky dial rather than a button for selecting light modes, a simple yet highly effective design element that I wish more brands would employ. The unit weighs next to nothing, looks great, and is excellent for seeing and being seen, with a good variety of modes to choose from.Bookman is still in its infancy, and there are a few issues that I’d like to see addressed. The quarter-turn twist-and-click mounting system, for instance, is great in theory, but I found it a bit loose, to the point that I had to keep recentering the light.It didn’t make the final cut because …the way the lens protrudes from the housing means that it throws light out at the sides.

If you experience an incident as a result of bad driving, the first thing the police will do is ask if you have footage.The Fly12 Sport combines a solid urban-commuting light with a powerful HD camera. Footage is recorded on a continuous loop, saved as multiple short segments and eventually automatically written over if it’s not needed. If an incident occurs, you can easily lock the recording segment so that it can’t be recorded over. There’s also a camera-only mode, with a maximum run time of seven hours.At 400 lumens on maximum power, the light is far from the brightest on the market, but it’s perfect for urban environments and partly lit streets. The flashing modes are bright enough for daytime riding, but side visibility is limited. Video is clear and crisp, recording up to 4K, which makes it easy to zoom in and pick out number plates.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive, and I was surprised there was no wireless file-transfer option, nor the option to view and edit video in theCycliqPlus appwithout an SD card reader.Light type:front;rechargeable battery:yes, USB-C cable (supplied);maximum output:400 lumens;IP rating:IP56;modes:5;full-beam run time:3hrs£299 at CycliqKnog Plus TwinpackView image in fullscreenBest for:urban commutesIf your main goal is to get from A to B on city streets, you probably don’t need a bells-and-whistles bike light that’s powerful enough to toast a slice of bread. What you want is a set of lights that are simple, easy to operate, affordable and sufficient to keep you visible to other road users. This twin pack from Knog, with the five modes, takes care of all of the above.They don’t look like conventional modern bike lights, mainly because they’re so light and small, but they’re surprisingly bright. There are two strap options to cater for different bikes, which means they’re a breeze to mount and operate.The cable-free design means the end of each unit slides off to reveal a USB connector that can be plugged directly into a laptop or a USB plug. Removing this part also converts the unit into a clippable light that can be easily fastened on to a piece of clothing or a bag. Run time is good at two hours on full power or a whopping 40 on eco-flash mode, and side visibility is excellent thanks to the wide beam pattern.It didn’t make the final cut because …the small rubber button is infuriatingly tricky to operate with gloves on.Light type:front and rear;rechargeable battery:yes, direct USB;maximum output:40 lumens front and 20 lumens rear;IP rating:IP67;modes:5;full-beam run time:2hrs£34.99 at Freewheel£26.49 at AmazonCateye ViZ450View image in fullscreenBest for:rear light visibilityIf you have any concerns about being visible from behind, day or night, attaching Cateye’s aptly named ViZ450 light to your seat post will soon put them to bed. This firework of a rear light spits out up to 450 lumens and has a transparent body that provides 300-degree visibility.The ViZ450 is the best light I tested for daytime visibility. It’s bright enough to spot from a long way off even in some of the more conservative flashing modes, and the side visibility is unrivalled.Some may argue that 450 lumens is excessive for a rear light. In most situations, that’s probably true, but it’s still nice to have the option of a high-visibility daytime mode. For example, I found it useful when riding into the low winter sun – a scenario in which I’m always acutely aware of how hard I might be to spot through the glare.It didn’t make the final cut because …battery life isn’t the best on the market for a rear light (I got 5hrs 10mins in constant mode), and the mounting-clip design is a bit fiddly.Light type:rear;rechargeable battery:yes, micro-USB cable (supplied);maximum output:450 lumens;IP rating:IPX4;modes:4;full-beam run time:5hrs£32.49 at CatEye Cycling£37 at Merlin CyclesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenThe Ravemen CR450 in action.What is a lumen?Lumens are a unit of measurement describing the amount of visible light emitted by a light source. It’s expressed as a number. The higher this number, the brighter the light.What type of bike light do I need?The best type of light depends on when and where you’re using it. For staying visible at night in urban environments, a relatively modest 200 lumens upfront and as little as 100 at the rear may be sufficient, but for seeing where you’re going in unlit woodland or country lanes, anywhere between 800 and 1,200+ lumens might be necessary.This chartfrom Halfords illustrates things nicely.Front v rearFront lights are designed to keep you visible, but most are bright enough to illuminate the route ahead to some extent. The UK law requires them to be white. Rear lights, on the other hand, are purely for visibility on the road; because of this, they’re usually not as bright as their handlebar-mounted counterparts, and the law requires them to be red.Mounting optionsMost front bike lights are made to be mounted on the handlebar, but designs vary. Most often, it’s some sort of rubber band or clamp mechanism, and it’s increasingly common for these to include a quick-release system.For people who use cycling computers, many light brands include a GoPro-style attachment that can be fitted to the underside of the bike’s computer mount. This allows the front light to sit neatly beneath the computer slap-bang in the middle of the “cockpit”.Rear lights tend to mount to the seat post, or, in some cases, the saddle rails. Many come with adaptable mounting systems to accommodate different shapes and sizes of seat post.Paddy Maddison is a freelance consumer journalist, outerwear enthusiast and exercise addict.

History has some answersNeal ShasoreWhatever stands in the tower’s footprint should be inspired by the community – and remind us that such a tragedy must never happen againThu 13 Feb 2025 09.48 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 09.52 ESTShareFor the past seven years, Grenfell Tower has been cloaked in white wrapping, protecting the fire-damaged fabric from further corrosion and the public from falling debris. This shroud covers a monumental cenotaph, a visceral reminder of the tragedy that claimed 72 lives and upended so many others. Now, the deputy prime minister has decided thatthe tower will be demolishedin time for the 10th anniversary of the fire in 2027. The justification is that the tower is structurally vulnerable, and – insipidly – because there is no consensus among the community groups and campaigns seeking reparative justice.Many of these groups have said theyfelt ignoredby the government’s decision, whilelocal residents remain divided. What is clear is that a top-down verdict from central government has obscured some of the careful thinking and deep engagement by various communities at a local level. As attention turns toward the construction of a permanent memorial, there are questions as to whether this can be handled with the appropriate sensitivity and proper consultation.Early signs, based on the government’s ruling, are that the system has not fundamentally been reformed. Decisions about a memorial to Grenfell will have a particular potency because the redevelopment of the site will be a measure of how the construction industry and regulatory regime have changed since the tragedy, from planning and procurement, design and construction, to management and maintenance.All of these processes should by now be practically inverted if we’ve achieved the shift needed: community-led, bottom-up planning; procurement based solely on quality, with clear and accountable contractual relationships; health, safety, accessibility and sustainability as primary considerations; a process of production that engages local skills and enhances the local economy; and – as the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission, made up of residents and survivors, advocates – a speedy transfer of ownership from government to an appropriate independent body. The government hascommitted to this, if that is the wish of the community, and an organisation will be set up to own and maintain it.Memorialisation and the design of monuments is a complicated process,as the continuing controversy around agreeing an appropriate site, form and purpose for theUK’s national Holocaust memorialdemonstrated. Theanti-monumentalismof the postwar years rejected themonolithic memorials that reflected the bombast and sublimity so favoured by despotic regimes. In London, this turn away from the grandiose has manifested in thefourth plinth commissions, but also more modestly and movingly in sites likeAltab Ali park, Whitechapel, where the racist murder of a young Bangladeshi textile worker in 1978 is commemorated by a decorative arch.Monuments to ordinary communities made extraordinary through disaster are as rare as they are difficult to design. But we can look to history for inspiration. Take the Victorian artist George Frederic Watts’s commitment to a Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice, situated in Postman’s Park, essentially a veranda designed by Ernest George with beautifully crafted ceramic tablets commemorating ordinary people who died selflessly saving the lives of others. More than half a century later, theLondoncounty council created a memorial to Londoners who had died during the blitz by creating an avenue of mature trees running between old County Hall and Waterloo Bridge on the South Bank.View image in fullscreenThe Memorial To Heroic Self-Sacrifice, by George Frederic Watts, in Postman’s Park in the City of London.Photograph: View Pictures/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesRuins and relics can also have their own potency: the medieval structure of Coventry Cathedral was badly damaged by a Luftwaffe raid. The architect Basil Spence retained what remained of the structure as a garden of remembrance, adjacent to his striking contemporary cathedral.The independent Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission, which is supported by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, has advanced the commissioning process byshortlisting a number of design teams, a refreshingly diverse list of practitioners in architecture and adjacent disciplines. Whoever is appointed, it will be daunting task and a weighty responsibility, with complex long-term considerations.Though the aspiration is that the official memorial will be permanent, it should also be able to evolve. The meaning and cultural memory of Grenfell will inevitably change, in ways we are unlikely to anticipate. The Victorians liked sturdy, fixed monuments – in our contemporary moment, this kind of heroic memorialisation simply does not cater to the diverse views and needs of the community or the public. The Monument in the City of London – it is easy to forget – commemorates the Great Fire of 1666, and its messages about the causes of the fire and the power relations that informed the City’s reconstruction represent avery specific historical contextnow largely forgotten.Further, even though the tower will be demolished, aspects of it should be preserved. When the architects Alison and Peter Smithson’s brutalist landmark housing scheme Robin Hood Gardens was finally consigned to the rubble heap, the V&A Museum was challenged to preserve a three-storey section in its collection. With appropriate supporting displays and interpretation, there could be a similar approach in keeping some of the fabric of Grenfell.Forensic Architecture, meanwhile, has not only sought to accurately record the tower’s structure and the technical failures it endured, but also developed “situated testimonies” in collaboration with residents, bereaved families and survivors.Angela Rayner defends handling of meeting with Grenfell survivors and familiesRead moreThe memorial provides an opportunity to commemorate the profound change that Grenfell has and must continue to have on how our cities and buildings are shaped. Academics like Liam Ross in Edinburgh have undertaken detailed research around what he terms “pyrotechnic cities”, the ways in which buildings and the urban condition have been shaped by fire and resulting regulatory or practical changes, including in North Kensington. Ross undertakes an “archaeology of fire”, observing the process of “concretising existing codes in new structures”. True memorialisation of disaster involves revising standards. Over the past three years, Ross and I have collaborated on designing ashort learning programmeaimed at arming professionals with deeper knowledge of fire and life safety, conceived as a memorial and a platform for change.There are already many memorials to Grenfell, driven by those most affected by the fire and on the frontline of campaigning. They remind us that memorialisation is not a passive or indeed singular act. Even if the tower were to remain, its potency as a symbol would depend on fundamental shifts in the way we think about our buildings and cities. A memorial should not and cannot be a “national” monument for gawping at, but a nodal point of a shared and renewed commitment to ensure such a tragedy never happens again.Neal Shasore is a historian of the built environment and heritage advocateDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sadly, not everyone agrees. That’s why, when I hear about an AI dream interpretation app, I’m seduced by the potential for a captive, preternaturally intelligent assistant to help me decipher the more baffling corners of my psyche.AI chatbots such as ChatGPT have a well-known tendency to riff and exaggerate with alarming confidence, but their verbose nature feels well-suited to the free form and highly associative task of dream analysis. Admittedly, tradinglittle understood fragments of our slumbering mindsto a tech startup in return for spiritual guidance sounds like the foreboding premise of a terrifying sci-fi horror movie. But the app’s fine print promises that dreams are stored “safely and privately”. Who am I to let an intuitive aversion to welcoming the machine into the last private vestiges of my consciousness get in the way of a good story?AI isn’t about unleashing our imaginations, it’s about outsourcing them. The real purpose is profitRead moreI download the app, punch in a recent, seemingly benign dream – I visit the supermarket to complain about a “defective condiment”, an apathetic checkout worker dismisses my concerns, and I brazenly spread stolen peanut butter on a piece of toast – and hit the “interpret” magic wand. “Dreaming ties all mankind together,” the app responds, spouting Jack Kerouac like a bad Tinder date, before proposing that my dream might allude to feelings of dissatisfaction and powerlessness, as well as a desire to assert myself. It’s convincing, if uninspired. A clear-eyed analysis of my dream scenario with none of the hallucinatory fervour I came here for.3:32You can make songs in seconds with Suno AI. We test if they're actually good – videoHoping to elicit deeper revelations, I goad the AI with some more troubling vignettes. In one, I’m ostensibly helping the police to catch a murderer, while secretly sending him flirtatious texts, seemingly playing them both. The app sees an inner conflict between morality and an attraction to danger. In another, I’m lost, manically careening through a hotel in search of my husband and baby; I pass a heaving dancefloor, a woman making strange, guttural noises, and an idyllic beach that, upon closer inspection, is just a mirage. Apparently, all this rich imagery amounts to a potential conflict between my own desires and societal expectations. Gentle food for thought, but hardly illuminating.To the developers’ credit, the AI is annoyingly even-keeled: it avoids absolutes, reminds me that dreams have multiple meanings and recommends therapy should my dreams begin to get the better of me.... my dreams cease entirely, giving the eerie sense that my subconscious is on strikeThe only thing that catches me off guard are the strange, AI-generated visuals; the hotel quest conjures a pair of dancing potatoes and the inexplicable phrase “PLE8T PABET”. In contrast, when I share this dream with an in-person community of dream enthusiasts, their insights are genuinely surprising, from noting my strong sense of purpose throughout the quest to observing how unease in a hotel setting evokes films such as The Shining and Lost in Translation.While the app doesn’t exactly shatter and rebuild my sense of self, it has some handy functionalities, such as the ability to identify and search recurring symbols in your dreams. (Try filtering years of handwritten journals for “mother”.) And it’s certainly convenient to grasp for my phone to catch fleeting, early-morning dream fragments, though I still find myself transcribing these digitised dreams back into my diary.Part of the pleasure of traversing my dreamscape is the ritual element of morning pages over a coffee. The warm glow of the screen kills the romance, especially as I invariably end up on another corner of my phone, spiritually further away from any potential revelations. Perhaps my dream practice is meant to be tactile and reflective, rather than efficient and gamified.Artificial intelligence – is it bad? Yes. But on the other hand it is also terrible | First Dog on the MoonRead moreDays later, while I’m pondering what might be lost to humanity should we collectively opt to train algorithms on these sacred messages from our psyches (and wondering what I might inadvertently reveal about myself in writing this article), I have a vivid, alarming dream. I’m standing in front of an audience, preparing to do a presentation on dreams, when a figure from my past interrupts and threatens to read from the dream journal I’ve carelessly left on my seat. Filled with rage, I force him to recite from his own dream diary, which he does in a silly goblin voice. “Don’t you like me any more? I thought you once loved me?” he presses. The AI interpretation confirms what I already know: my dreams are shy, demure and resolute that at least some of my private interior landscape should remain that way.In the coming days, my dreams cease entirely, giving the eerie sense that my subconscious is on strike, refusing to clock back on until I promise not to sell it out to AI. Unable to conceive of the drudgery of a life without dreams, I delete the app and any trace of my dream data with it. I uploaded my dreams to AI and all I got was the revelation that my subconscious is a tech-averse luddite.Tara Kenny is an arts and culture writer based in Naarm/MelbourneExplore more on these topicsSleepOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

But what, precisely, does Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, wish to see?His headline demand thatthe CMA should be “more agile”was meaningless – no politician, one suspects, has ever encouraged any regulator to be less nimble. Reynolds’ formal ministerial“strategic steer”was slightly better on specifics but not by much. It mostly rehearsed the government’s unconvincing but now-familiar refrain that there’s a role for regulators to play in encouraging growth and investment.The easy bit to decipher from the high-level signalling was that everybody wants the CMA to make its decisions faster. Sarah Cardell, the watchdog’s chief executive, listed “pace” as the first of her “four Ps” for the new era, and nobody will grumble about a commitment to reduce the target for dealing with straightforward merger cases from 35 working days to 25. The “process” bit of her agenda, designed to encourage direct dialogue with companies, is similarly inoffensive.The trickier ones are “predictability” and “proportionality”. What, for example, does taking “a proportionate approach to looking at global deals” mean? A natural reading is that the CMA has been prodded to ignore deals in the style of Microsoft’s bid for fellow US company Activision Blizzard, the Call of Duty developer, in 2023. Recall that the CMA’s initial refusal prompted a senior Microsoft executive to launch intoa wild rant about “our darkest day in our four decades in Britain”.Has the UK, without quite saying so out loud, decided it wants to avoid such aggro from US big tech in future? It rather looks that way. That seems to be the main conclusion from Thursday’s set-piece.The rest of it, though, raised more questions than answers, certainly when it comes to moving the growth dial. The real tension in this area is what happens if the “pro-growth” agenda collides with the “pro-competition” one when the CMA is considering whether to shake up a UK market. On that score, it is hard to say we learned anything.Look at one of the first inquiries launched under the new digital markets regime –into Google’s dominance of “search” advertising. The CMA diagnoses something akin to a £500-per-year Google tax for households and wonders whether the sum could be reduced by more effective competition. Google, one assumes, would hate some ofthe CMA’s early ideas, such as forcing it to make data available to other businesses, and may regard them as anti-growth or anti-innovation.Is the regulator’s appetite for such fights affected in any way by Reynolds’ signalling? Presumably not. All the usual commitments to uphold consumer interests remain, and the CMA’s actual remit isn’t being changed. So it’s hard to see how airy political signalling adds anything to the mix – it just invites suspicion of the CMA’s independent process.The other problem, of course, is that expecting regulators to produce growth is asking too much.As argued here previously, the government itself holds bigger growth levers, such as planning reform, the cost of energy, and the tax regime. Faster decision-making at the CMA may help at the margin – but, really, it’s small stuff.None of which clears up the mystery of why Bokkerink was invited to fall on his regulatory ballpoint pen, to be replaced by Doug Gurr, a former chief of Amazon UK. As a former senior partner of Boston Consulting Group, Bokkerink always seemed a business-friendly type. Maybe it was a clash of personalities. Maybe it indicated more change than was actually described on Thursday; if so, the government should be clearer about what it expects.Explore more on these topicsBusinessNils Pratley on financeCompetition and Markets AuthorityRegulatorscommentShareReuse this content"

Millions of lives are now at riskDevi SridharOn top of the human cost, the US’s soft power and influence is disappearing. Russia and China will fill the voidThu 13 Feb 2025 07.12 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 11.59 ESTShareAmid the daily troubling news coming from the United States are the ongoing and increasingly damaging efforts by President Donald Trump, supported by secretary of state Marco Rubio and Elon Musk, toshut downthe US Agency for International Development (USAid). Muskhas called it a “criminal organization” and said that it was “time for it to die”. The agency website is down, so little official information is available. But in the week since funding to the agency was frozen, and the majority of staff placed on leave, thousands of public health and development programmes worldwide have been thrown into turmoil, and now face an uncertain future.USAid is the main federal agency that works to provide foreign aid assistance to the poorest countries and people in the world. On Friday, a US judge prevented around2,000 USAid employeesfrom being placed on leave, and ordered the reinstatement of about 500 more. But Trump and Musk appear to want to move forward with a plan that would see its global workforce reduced from about 10,000 staff and contractors,to just over 600.It’s hard to overstate how disruptive this has already been tohumanitarian work worldwide: most programmes have just been shut overnight with staff laid off, drugs and food left in warehouses, and patients and others not able to access services. The people affected live in some of the most vulnerable countries like Ukraine, Jordan, Ethiopia, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Afghanistan.Although we don’t know the full extent of the damage, specific reports suggest that vital services have beenthrown into chaos. Some walk-in sexual health and HIV services in South Africashuttered overnight without notice, Ethiopia’s health ministry has reportedly laid off5,000 healthcare professionalswho were hired with US funding, and nearlyhalf a billion dollars worth of food aidoverseen by the agency and currently in ports, transit or storage is destined to spoil.USAid’s overall contribution is immense. It is the largest humanitarian operator globally – in 2023, the US provided 42% of all humanitarian assistance orabout $68bn(£55bn), of which USAid spendingmade up about $40bn. And yet at the same time, both foreign aid and USAid specifically make up a tiny fraction of federal government spending: less than 1%. Cutting back makes little difference to overall US government spending, but is massively destructive to programmes reliant on this funding to deliver theiron-the-ground work.What does that less than 1% of federal spending buy the US public? This argument has been re-hashed in presidency after presidency, and the answers are clear.Foreign aid can reduce instability, conflict and extreme poverty, which are major causes of mass displacement. Supporting programmes that keep more places safe and stable means fewer people needing to flee persecution, dire poverty or violence. With all the concerns over illegal immigration, reducing aid could make this challengeeven harder to manage. Foreign aid can support countries to grow economically and create new markets and opportunities. Think of places like India, which have managed to create a vibrant and growing middle class.In the world of global health, foreign aid is vital to support countries in managing health challenges, including outbreaks of infectious diseases. Just think back to the west AfricaEbola outbreak in 2014. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone struggled to contain Ebola spreading and were reliant on international partners to assist them. It was in the interest of all countries to help them given that the global spread of Ebola was imminent. In addition, the US builds vital soft power and influence in countries in which it provides help. Russia and China have learned this lesson – and will probably step into theaid vacuum left by the US.And beyond any of those “enlightened self-interest” arguments above is the simple fact that foreign aid helps other human beings who are struggling, including some of the poorest and most vulnerable in the world. It’s good to do because it’s simply good to do. Cutting programmes overnight means that women who might have lived are more likely to die in childbirth; those with HIV face not having access to clinics for lifesaving antiretroviral treatment; and hungry children no longer get nutritional supplements and food.Foreign aid shouldn’t be a partisan issue. The largest global health programme for a single disease, Pepfar, was launched by a Republican president, George W Bush, and is estimated to have prevented 25 million Aids deaths since its creation. I think back to apoll of Americansin 2016 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, where more than 60% of respondents said that the US was spending either the right amount or too little on global health, and only about 30% thought it was spending too much. It’s not clear that the US public actually supports these drastic cuts and freezes.Perhaps many now think that the US needs to worry more about its own domestic financial troubles than sending money overseas.A recent studyfound that the US economy is performing better than any of its peer countries, but performs worse on other metrics like health, happiness and social trust. “Wealthy but unhappy” is what the study’s authors found. Maybe the lesson here is that Americans need to reject Trump’s discourse and embrace being part of a global community and engaging with the world through agencies like USAid. That could lead to an America that is still wealthy, but just a bit more healthy and happy.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghExplore more on these topicsUSAidOpinionUS politicsUS foreign policyAidAids and HIVDonald TrumpElon MuskcommentShareReuse this content"

He sounded much better beforeAdrian ChilesSeven or eight years ago, Starmer was as close as most politicians get to sounding natural and sincere. It’s a shame he messed with thatThu 13 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTShareOur prime minister, it turns out, has hadmany years of voice coaching. Some of this work apparently happened during lockdown and may or may not have been in breach of the rulesthen in place. This has been the main talking point, which is a shame, because a far more interesting topic is voice coaching itself.I’ve had a fair amount of stick about the way I speak, so I don’t feel good about disparaging anyone’s voice. I’ll put it like this: Starmer’s voice isn’t his greatest asset. I wonder what response his voice coach could have got upon telling someone that the way he spoke was down to her. Embarrassed silence? It prompts the question: how bad can his voice have been before?Keir Starmer in 2017.The answer is, fascinatingly, not that bad at all. Listen to him seven or eight years ago. He may not have had a shot at playing Henry V for the Royal Shakespeare Company, but he sounded just fine – as close as most politicians get to coming across as natural and sincere. So why mess with that?If Starmer’s present speaking voice is the answer, then what on earth was the question? It surely can’t have been: how can we make this plainly passionate and clever man sound mannered, stilted and a trifle insincere? There must be someone on his team who now listens to him speak, nods approvingly and says: “Yep, this is just how we want him sounding. Good job, everyone.”What drives political advisers to mess around with something as fundamental as a person’s voice? It’s not like changing their hair or their clothes. It’s bigger than that – and much harder to pull off convincingly. Don’t tell me there was a focus group suggesting it would be better if he sounded like he does now.Yes, we all knowMargaret Thatcher was coached to lower her voiceand this was a stroke of genius, blah blah. But she, too, sounded better as she was in the first place. She ended up sounding plain weird. It may be that her electoral success came despite that, rather than because of it.Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Last year, it sparked another gold rush – and looming calamity for local authoritiesThu 13 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 06.56 ESTSharePerhaps only England could make its politician of the moment a woman who died more than a decade ago. Yet turn on Channel 4 and watch Margaret Thatcher: the drama. Radio 4 offers Margaret Thatcher: the play, while soon you can enjoy Thatcher: the opera. For those who can’t wait, there’s Thatcher: the news story, as the British media celebrates 50 years this week since she was crowned Tory leader.Such pieces are reliably more fascinated by how she looked (Shoulder pads! Handbag!Blondhalo!) than what she did. So let me tell you a story about one of Thatcher’s deeds that shapes how we live today. Rather than some dusty tale dug out of the archive, it’s unfolding right now. And you won’t have seen it in any other newspaper.At its heart is that flagship of Thatcherism: the right to buy. Her single biggest privatisation, it allowed tenants of homes built and owned by the public to buy them at a bargain price. Launched in 1980, the policy remains in force today – although its heyday was thought to be long past. Until, that is,Keir Starmerbecame prime minister.Among the first acts of Starmer’s government was to slash the discount available to council tenants wanting to buy their homes. In London, the cut is especially sharp: before the deadline of 21 November2024, the markdown could be as much as £136,400; now it is £16,000. It’s a good move, squeezing demand and all but choking Thatcher’s policy to death. It’s also a dramatic move – but just how dramatic is not public. To find out, I sent freedom of information requests to every London council.You may think you know what’s coming next. Perhaps you figure that, as the deadline loomed, there was a stream of interest. Wrong: there was no stream; there was a deluge.Of the 32 London boroughs, 27 responded. After analysing their results, I can reveal:Brent saw a more than 7,000% rise in right-to-buy (RTB) applications in November over the month before; in Lambeth and Camden, it was more than 2,000%, for Southwark, 1,500%.November’s flood of applications means Lewisham is dealing with more bids this financial year than it received in the previous four years put together, while Hackney is managing the equivalent of more than three years’ worth of would-be buyers.Islington got 922 RTB applications in November alone, where it would normally expect closer to 200 over an entire year.With months still left of this financial year, London authorities have together already received 3.5 times the RTB applications they got last year.Whether north or south of the river, inner city or outer suburb, the pattern is unmistakable and stark. Battered by years of cuts, besieged by the spending pressures local authorities now face, as I heard on phone call after phone call, there has been “an explosion” in applications; a “staggering” number of bids; “unprecedented” demand. Just look at this chart, and the map, showing right-to-buy applications over the course of this year. They basically flatline until November – then they rocket.Chart of right to buy applicationsMap of applicationsAt London’s largest council landlord, Southwark, where more than 1,300 bids flooded in over the first three weeks of November, they’re drafting in extra staff to handle the fraud checks and other formalities, so the team can swell to twice its usual size. Despite that and the legal deadlines, they told me they estimate it will take more than 19 weeks simply to get through the first stages.What these boroughs are describing is low-level chaos, and it is by no means confined to London. In other big cities, councils are facing the same thing: a blizzard of paperwork too large for staff to handle, a good proportion of dodgy or flawed bids, and no certainty at all about how many council homes are flogged off at the end of it all. Take as an example Lewisham where, over the past couple of years, about half of all RTB applications have resulted in sales. Apply that same ratio to bids received last November alone, and at a stroke the borough will lose almost as many council homes as the total it has built since 2020.Call it Thatcher’s hangover: the good times, if that’s what they were, wore off long ago and now all that’s left is a dusty thudding in the head and costs that never stop rising. Her most famous policy, right to buy, shows how the hangover never stops. Public money was spent on building those homes; public money was lost through giving them away cheap; and public money is now funnelled in housing benefit to the landlords who let them out.Last November’s gold rush exposes how cynical those homilies about a property-owning democracy always were. Property owning? For some, but for others try: property flipping, property renting, property accumulating – done on the cheap with taxpayers’ cash. While the private sector keeps raking it in, the public sector is deprived of rental income and forced into ever more desperate measures to house tenants. In my own London borough of Enfield, families with nowhere else to live arenow shipped offto ex-mining villages in County Durham.At Southwark, they reckon they’ve lost 16,000 homes over the decades through right to buy. About half of those are now rented out privately to tenants who might otherwise have got them from the council, with cheaper rents and more secure contracts. “By depriving councils of homes, right to buy takes away the security that allows kids to finish school or their parents to keep their jobs,” says Southwark council’s leader, Kieron Williams. “The rise in homelessness is more or less a direct result of right to buy.”Starmerism is a small and ever-shrinking puddle of ideas, but it retains an emphasis on building stuff: infrastructure, homes, new towns. Ministers talk big numbers about housebuilding, yet they refuse to set targets on council housebuilding. Starmer focuses on housing supply, about which the far more politically savvy Thatcher didn’t give a monkey’s. She cared only about demand – demand fromherpeople, her voters, who in turn rewarded her with three election victories. Without the aid of a focus group, Starmer’s team barely know who their people are. They won’t come out and argue for more council homes. At best, they’ll do the right thing, but by stealth, in the small print, where they’ll hope GB News never finds it.But you need more than this comedy of errors – shoving a terrible policy off-stage, sparking yet another huge selloff in the process and inducing another drop in council housing. You really need an alternative. At Wandsworth council, Aydin Dikerdem is the cabinet lead for housing. While not opposing right to buy, he talks about the need to build council homes, to expand notions of what the public realm can provide.“My mum and dad lived on a council estate, and my mum was a teacher. Today that would be totally utopian,” he says. “But it wasn’t a generation ago. Within a generation, we’ve lost a sense of public assets and public housing. But that means we can also get it back in a generation.”Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionHousingMargaret ThatcherCommunitiesKeir StarmerLabourConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

At least Chamberlain was trying to prevent a major European war, whereas Trump is acting in the middle of one. Trump’s “Munich” (synonymous in English with the 1938 deal in which Britain and France sold out Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany) comes on the eve of the big security conference in today’s Bavarian capital, where his emissaries will meet western allies. That Munich security conference must be the beginning of a decisive European response, learning from our own tragic history in order to avoid repeating it.The next step Trump proposes is in effect a new “Yalta” (referring to the February 1945 US-Soviet-UK summit in the Crimean resort of Yalta, which has become synonymous with superpowers deciding the fate of European countries over their heads). In this case, his proposal is that the US and Russia should decide the fate ofUkrainewith marginal if any involvement of Ukraine or other European countries. But this time the occupants of the White House and the Kremlin should meet first in Saudi Arabia, then in their respective capitals, while it seems the actual Yalta, in the Crimea, is to be ceded to Russia. For in the brave new world of Trump and Putin, might is right and territorial expansion is what great powers do, be it Russia to Ukraine, the US to Canada and Greenland – or China to Taiwan.All historical analogies have their limits and those with “Munich” and “Yalta” have been overused. But here, for once, they do feel apposite – so long as we highlight differences as well as similarities.For a few weeks after Trump’s election we had a faint hope that when it came to Ukraine his administration would follow its proclaimed motto of “peace through strength”, understanding that strength is the only language Putin comprehends. Now we see that Trump not only bullies his country’s friends but sucks up to his country’s enemies.This so-called strongman is actually a weak man when it comes to confronting the hostile authoritarians of this world. In just one day, he has made four large, unnecessary and damaging concessions. First, he has not just initiated exploratory talks with Putin via an intermediary, which would be defensible, but personally given the Russian dictator fulsome and sycophantic recognition as a world leader. “We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations,” he reported of their long phone call, in asocial media post. They discussed “the great benefit that we will someday have in working together. But first, as we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.” Imagine if in 1941, instead of entering the war against Nazi Germany on the side of Britain and other allied European nations, the president of the United States had rung up Hitler, reflected on “the Great History of our Nations”, and then talked about jointly ending “the War with Germany/Britain”.Second, he has offered the Russian leader a bilateral US-Russian negotiation over the heads of the Ukrainians, precisely the kind of new Yalta that Putin has always wanted. And then, third and fourth, he has declared that Ukraine will almost certainlyhave to concede territoryand that the US will not support its membership of Nato. Both those things have been said privately in Washington and other western capitals for some time, but publicly conceding them upfront is a masterclass in hownotto practise the “art of the deal”. (He did something similar in negotiations with the Taliban over Afghanistan, starting rather than ending with a timetable for US withdrawal.) Historians now have the notes and recollections of those close to Hitler, documenting his delight at the deal he exacted from Chamberlain. One day, we may have similar evidence of Putin’s private glee at the concessions made by Trump.This doesn’t mean there will be anything deserving the name of peace any time soon. The Kremlin’s first public readout from the Trump-Putin call was notably cautious, warning that it is “essential to settle the reasons for the conflict”. Probably Putin’s ideal scenario would be to keep talking peace with Trump, through a series of leisurely summits in Saudi Arabia, the US and Russia, while Russia continues to press forward on the battlefield, demolish Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and undermine its economy, society and political unity in other ways. (Asked about the involvement of Ukraine in the talks, Trump mentioned the need for a presidential election there, thus parroting a Russian attack line on the legitimacy of presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy.)There’s one huge difference between Europe at the time of the original Munich and Yalta, and Europe now. Today’s Europe is rich, free, democratic and a closely integrated community of partners and allies. Yes, as recent polling by the European Council on Foreign Relations again demonstrates, it’s alsodivided and confusedabout the best way forward for Ukraine. But with a sufficiently determined coalition of willing and capable countries, definitely including Britain, Europe can still enable Ukraine to stabilise the frontline, hold up economically and eventually get to negotiate from strength, not weakness. That’s why this weekend’s Munich security conference must be the beginning of a European riposte to Trump’s Munich.Timothy Garton Ash is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the scale of his surrender to Russian aggression has still shocked them. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin’s nearly three years of isolation by the west was broken by his 90-minute, “highly productive”conversationwith Mr Trump. Joe Biden called the Russian president a murderous dictator; Mr Trump praised Mr Putin’s mounting aggression towards Ukraineas “genius”, days before the full-scale invasion of 2022. Now, two great powers plan negotiations – without regard for Ukraine, Europe or even Mr Trump’s own Ukraine envoy.Forget territorial integrity. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, described a return to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders as“unrealistic”and “an illusory goal”. Forget Ukrainian membership of Nato: “I don’t think it’s practical … I’m OK with that,” Mr Trumpdeclared.Forget US support: it will be up to European countries and others to provide any deterrent force, the US defence secretarymade clear. European security is no longer the primary focus for the US, added Mr Hegseth – and that was the toned-down version.Mr Trump had alreadyaired the notionthat Ukraine “may be Russian some day”. Now he is not even feigning interest in Kyiv’s views. Mr Trump presumably believes that when the US turns off the tap, Ukraine and Europe will be forced to acquiesce in whatever he and Mr Putin have cooked up. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,told the Guardianthis week that “security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees”. Mr Trump has not only sidelined Mr Zelenskyy but further undermined him by pushing Russia’s narrative thatelections must be on the way.WhateverUkrainesays in public, it understood that Nato membership was never imminent and surely anticipated some territorial concessions, however bitter after so much sacrifice. But Mr Trump has given way to Russian demands before even reaching the negotiating table. This sounds more like the art of surrender than the art of the deal. Mr Putin, however, is in no rush. The last thing he wants is Nato members’ forces on the ground in Ukraine. Dragging out talks might allow funding for Kyiv to dry up and domestic grumbling in Ukraine to morph into political instability, while Russia makes further battlefield advances.The failure of Mr Trump’s talks with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un showed how his rhetoric can run up against reality. Some have suggested that his self-regard will prevent him from settling for a deal in whichRussiatoo obviously prevails. Perhaps he may yet latch on to a different exit if someone can find one that appeals to his vanity. Yet whatever the outcome, Mr Trump will surely declare it a triumph.For Ukraine, and others in the region, this is an existential war. For others – including the US – this has been about containing and degrading a hostile power, notwithstanding the sincere sympathy and grand statements about defending democracy. It is not only Ukraine that now hears the bell tolling. Despite fears that European domestic politics are tending away from staunch support for Kyiv, Thursday’s forceful responses to the US from European nations,including Britain, are welcome. They are right to insist that they, like Ukraine, must be part of any negotiations, to state their commitment to its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to stress their willingness to enhance support. Mr Trump is abandoning Ukraine. Others would be both wrong and reckless to follow suit.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Inequality, weak public investment and government cuts threaten prosperity. Labour must offer voters something differentThu 13 Feb 2025 13.57 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 18.11 ESTShareThe picture painted by official data for the UK economy in 2024 reveals a country broken by 14 years of Conservative party rule. True, the economygrew– somewhat unexpectedly – butGDP per headfell, showing prosperity didn’t reach most people. There are a few reasons for this decline but none suggests a healthy society. One is runaway wealth inequality, with gains hoarded at the top. Another is stark regional disparities, with some areas falling further behind despite national GDP rising. A third is rising immigration without enough job creation – more workers, but not enough well-paying positions.A growing economy means little if it doesn’t improve living standards. In 2024, it didn’t. This political reality has shaped recent years, and not in a good way. It’s worth recalling a Newcastle woman’s tart response to the political scientist Anand Menon in 2016 when he warned that Brexit would hit GDP:“That’s your bloody GDP, not ours.”That continuing frustration explains the current backlash against mainstream politicians. No wonder Sir Keir Starmer wants his party to be one ofdisruption.Thursday’s growth figures offer the prime minister a chance to break the mould of British politics. Unfortunately, he seems reluctant to act. What’s clear from the statistics is that, in 2024, government spending drove growth – boosted by rising wages, especially in the public sector – rather than business investment or net trade. Labour could challenge the status quo with a new economic vision centred on the state. Instead, unfortunately, the government promotes the idea that growth depends on government inaction in the face ofunfettered capitalism.Statistics often disguise the state’s role, framingpublic servicesas just another economic input rather than the engine of demand they are. This distortion makes the economy look more market-driven than reality, reinforcing neoliberal myths. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, unfortunately, seems more eager to conform to these narratives than challenge them. She plans to cutpublic sector net borrowingfrom March 2025 to meet fiscal rules – austerity by another name. The last time this happened, post-2010, it led to a decade of weak growth and stagnant wages. The justice secretary,Shabana Mahmood,gets it. This week, she called out austerity’s role in wrecking probation services. If she was trying to change the chancellor’s mind, she deserves thanks. Britain can’t afford years of cuts.One of John Maynard Keynes’sharpestinsights was what’s good for society isn’t always good for profits. That’s why theGreen Alliance, a thinktank, is right – injecting £3bn into discounting rail fares to boost passenger miles by 22% is smart economics. It’s a win for regional growth, for the climate and for cleaner air. The state has the power to make capitalism work for the public – if it chooses to use it. But Labour’s delay on releasing itsindustrial strategyis a worrying sign.The UK must move away from a debt-driven, low-wage, financialised economic model. Public investment in infrastructure – especially in underserved regions – and in skills and industry is needed to stimulate demand and create high-quality jobs. Raising wages and reducing inequality will ensure broad-based prosperity, not just asset bubbles. The belief that“markets know best”has prevented bold action on Britain’s yawning economic divides and the climate emergency. After 40 years of weakening the state and rewarding rentier capitalism, reform is urgent. Labour must build a system that delivers it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s why I quit the UK Foreign Office, 9 February). When we successfullytook the government to courtto stop arming Saudi Arabia, the key legal and moral questions were essentially the same. How could the UK government continue supplying arms in the face of overwhelming evidence of the most horrific crimes being committed against civilians?What Smith’s evidence shows is that the only way for the Foreign Office to keep doing this is to bully civil servants and diplomats into changing their reports, warning them not to leave any written evidence, or even asking them to “delete correspondence”. There has been a systematic effort to manipulate and suppress the truth.Sadly, what we see is not a “broken” export-licensing system but one working exactly as intended – as Smith says, it serves “to create a facade of legitimacy, while allowing the most egregious crimes against humanity to take place”.Thousands of campaigners across the UK have been vindicated, but it’s too late for tens of thousands of Palestinian and Yemeni people, who have been murdered with weapons and components exported from the UK. This has to be a wake-up call and lead to systemic change in our arms-export licensing system.Dr Sam Perlo-FreemanResearch coordinator, Campaign Against Arms TradeMark Smith’s brave and principled stand shows how compromised and weak British foreign policy has become. In a post-Brexit Trump world, our only “principles” appear to be to perform as a slavish support act to whatever the US government deems to be in its interest.Our erstwhile EU partners must despair, while a “transactional” US president fantasises about golf courses on Gaza’s ruins and graves. The callow attempts of politicians and civil servants to circumvent the clear prescriptions of international law and morality deserve general condemnation. We need to call out this complicity with genocide.Paul BennettLondonAs a concerned citizen who worked in the Foreign Office many years ago, I wish to congratulate Mark Smith for his honesty and courage in resigning on moral issues. I have worked abroad for most of my adult life, including in Lebanon, and am greatly concerned by, and identify with, the Palestinian cause.He rightly calls the war against Palestinians genocide, and clearly shows the complicity of the British government. I second his call for other civil servants in the Foreign Office to press the government to end this indefensible policy.Helen JonesBristolMark Smith has learned that the UK government doesn’t care about Palestinians, or the war crimes committed against them. What the government does care about is money. The UK makes a nice profit from selling arms toIsrael. Additionally, by going along with the genocide in Gaza, it can maintain good relations with its top trading partner, the US. The government doesn’t care about fairness, justice or honesty. Mr  Smith’s problem is that he has a conscience.Laura HarlingEl Dorado Hills, California, USHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As a hearing-aid user, I have found that only the RSC at Stratford-upon-Avon offers an exemplary service when it comes to captioned performances (which I have to say has transformed my enjoyment of Shakespeare). Too many theatres offer nothing at all. Well done to Tim Rice for highlighting this issue, but please don’t stop at musicals.Alan GentCheadle, CheshireHear, hear to Tim Rice’s suggestion that musicals have surtitles – and not just musicals. I should like to go to more theatre performances, but, being hard of hearing, miss out unless there are surtitles. My experience is that the loop systems that link to hearing aids are poor or don’t work in most theatres and cinemas, and it’s potluck if one’s seat is in a position to receive a signal. I’ve taken to watching streamed plays at home as they have subtitles unavailable when the same play is streamed to a cinema.Dr Kirstine OswaldHillhead, MidlothianTim Rice is right about the use of surtitles in stage musicals. I would go further and suggest that they can be integrated into the production. A good instance of this was Michael Tippett’s opera-cum-musical New Year, composed when he was in his 80s. Its production style attracted a new, young audience who thought the composer amazingly with-it. Among them was the Beatle Paul McCartney, who requested a meeting with the composer, which I arranged; they got on like a house on fire.Meirion BowenLondonTim Rice is concerned that audiences are often unable to appreciate lyrics in musicals. Are surtitles the answer? I wonder if sound engineering is part of the problem. Where did the idea come from that louder is better for the music? No wonder audiences can’t make out the lyrics when they’re overwhelmed by the music. Tone the music down and we’ll remember the lyrics for ever.Elaine YeoEnfield, LondonDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, pleaseclick hereto upload it.

He was speaking in relation to Abdoulaye Doucouré’s provocative celebrations in front of the Liverpool support. Liverpool’s loss of control before the final whistle, however, was not normal for an Arne Slot team, though it also fuelled the anger that exploded on their final trip across Stanley Park.There was comfort amidthe mayhemof the last Merseyside derby at Goodison for Liverpool in the form of a seven-point lead over striker-less Arsenal at the top of the Premier League. There were also questions to be asked of Liverpool’s second successive below-par performance at the home of their oldest rivals. The visitors at least departed with a valuable point on this occasion but deserved no more, however much the manner ofJames Tarkowski’s 98th-minute equaliserstung.The great escapism: Everton’s Corner Flag Guy and football’s lasting capacity for joy | Max RushdenRead moreDavid Moyes’s Everton repeated what Sean Dyche’s Everton did to Liverpool in thecorresponding fixture last seasonin terms of refusing to let their rivals settle in possession, cutting off their passing lanes and bombarding their penalty area at the earliest opportunity. Liverpool suffered again, losing composure in their feet long before losing it in their heads. Alexis Mac Allister’s and Mohamed Salah’s goals followed rare moments of controlled, patient approach work by Slot’s team. The style that has underpinned Liverpool’s march on the Premier League title needs to be rediscovered before four key games in 11 days against Wolves, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Newcastle.Liverpool had only six attempts on Jordan Pickford’s goal on Wednesday, with four on target. It was their lowest tally in a Premier League game this season and the fewest since having four against Manchester City in April 2023. Everton had 10 attempts, three on target, and that with an attack featuring only one fit striker in Beto and options that pale in comparison with the resources at Slot’s disposal.The lack of composure in the Liverpool performance, from the off, was exacerbated by the 64 long balls they played. It was their joint-highest total of the season and played to the strengths of anEvertondefence featuring the towering trio of Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite and Jake O’Brien. Ryan Gravenberch’s usually telling influence was nullified and the Liverpool midfielder was withdrawn in the 61st minute.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah’s goal followed one of Liverpool’s few cohesive passages of play.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/Shutterstock‘We all know we could have played better,” Van Dijk said. “But you play against a team who we all know this is their game of the season. We’ve seen it over the years. Coming here is always difficult and the way they play they make it uncomfortable for you – long balls, second-ball fights, balls that just fall in the right position – and you have to be ready to work your socks off. At times we matched it quite good and other times we couldn’t do it. Overall I think we definitely could have done better but you are still playing against a team who has strength in the way they played and we have to adapt to that.”Liverpool and Everton unite to condemn racist abuse of Abdoulaye DoucouréRead moreLiverpool’s temperament was stretched by the referee, Michael Oliver, before Doucouré provided the tipping point. Both teams, however, had legitimate reasons to lament the official’s inconsistent display. Both teams should also be thankful that red cards were not shown before the final whistle, as they might have been in the hands of a weaker referee swayed by their antics.Slot’s cool demeanour evaporated in the heat of his first Merseyside derby. He cut an agitated figure throughout a contest in which Liverpool conceded 20 fouls, another season high. He had analysed last season’s Goodison derby, pinpointed the number of cheap fouls that Liverpool conceded as a factor in their defeat and appealed for cool heads, but his advice on how to avoid a repeat went ignored. Oliver was not entirely responsible for that.But Van Dijk said: “I think the ref, and I told the ref, didn’t have it under the control we wanted. Some fouls were easily given and some weren’t. In the end these moments are decisive and for Doucouré to provoke the fans triggers [us] and that is absolutely normal. For Curt [Curtis Jones] to get a red, and everyone is jumping on it, in that case is a normal thing. I tried to stay calmer and get everyone away because I know how much we need everyone on Sunday but when the ref gives the manager and assistant coach a red as well that’s a bit strange.“Conceding a goal in the last seconds of a game, or even after added time of a game, is very difficult. I think it was already over time, that was my view, and in my opinion it was a foul on Ibou [Konaté]. That hurt and should hurt for each one of us but it is the reality. You have two things you can do: you can dwell on it and stay angry about it or you can take it on board, start the recovery and be ready for Wolves because that will be a difficult test again. I think that’s the best thing to do.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolEvertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But not even the greatest script-writers could have predicted how the most remarkable game in the competition’s 30-year history would unfold.Wigan, the people’s club, keep their doors wide open in pursuit of perfectionRead moreThe biggest opening-night crowd was in attendance at the Brick Community Stadium. Not a single one of the 21,748 people here would have expected to watch the lowest-scoring game Super League has ever seen. And that does not even skim the surface when it comes to the records that were set here on a gripping, engrossing and ultimately bizarre evening.There have been thousands of Super League fixtures since the competition launched in 1996. Not a single one has finished 0-0 after 80 minutes. Only two have gone to the end without there being a try scored: Salford’s 5-2 win over Harlequins in 2007, and Warrington’s 4-0 victory against Hull FC in 2022. The last 0-0? All the way back in 1993.But here, at the end of regulation time, two great rivals could not be separated. The cynics may suggest that Wigan’s and Leigh’s attacks are yet to click, and they both misfired on the night. But you could just as equally argue that defensively, two sides who will be in the mix for the Super League title this year were fantastic from minute one to minute 82: when Gareth O’Brien finally snapped the deadlock in dramatic fashion.View image in fullscreenLeigh’s Gareth O’Brien lets fly to land the decisive drop goal after 80 minutes of no score.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PALeigh have not won at the home of their neighbours since 1983. But O’Brien ended that run two minutes into golden point extra time as he held his nerve when others faltered, kicking a wonderful long-range drop goal to ensure the Leopards started 2025 with a win that reaffirms their credentials as one of the fancied teams, while the reigning champions and quadruple winners start with a defeat.“Wigan are the only club we haven’t beaten since coming back up to Super League. Our first win here in 42 years. It’s a wonderful achievement,” said Leigh’s coach, Adrian Lam.“It had a playoff feel to it with the intensity. Our fans will be tearing Leigh up tonight given how long they’ve had to wait for this. I’m delighted for them.”With Buffer on hand to bring the players out as the hype starts to roll up for the Warriors’ game against Warrington in Las Vegas next month, the intensity from both sides mirrored the excitement delivered by the pre-match entertainment. But it was apparent from an early stage that points would be in short supply, with stunning last-ditch defensive efforts denying both sides.View image in fullscreenThe players take to the pitch after being introduced by Michael Buffer.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAIt looked as though things would click into gear after half-time when Liam Farrell was sent to the sin-bin for kicking the ball away. Within a minute, Wigan thought they had scored against the run of play when Jai Field touched down, but there was a ball steal in the buildup. Leigh then failed to take advantage of the 10 minutes without Farrell on the field and incredibly the score remained 0-0.Chances came and went in the frenetic final few moments, with each side rejecting the chance to kick a winning drop goal. And when Adam Keighran was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle with seconds remaining, it left the door ajar for Leigh heading into the golden point overtime period.Super League 2025: team-by-team guide to the new seasonRead moreWigan turned down a drop goal attempt on their first chance with possession and when Leigh broke downfield a minute later, O’Brien – who famously kicked the drop goal that kept Salford in Super League in the 2016 Million Pound Game – produced the goods to seal the most remarkable victory, and remarkable scoreline, Super League has perhaps ever seen.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It was tough to lose but it was a high-quality game, very intense and I thought both teams played to a really high level,” Wigan’s coach, Matt Peet, said. “There will be things we’ll look back at, plays we could have made at certain times of the game.

However in her final training session before competing she felt a tightness in the hamstring, which a scan subsequently revealed was more serious than it initially appeared.‘Women’s sport is in a good place’: Keely Hodgkinson hails Spoty’s four in a rowRead more“I won’t lie – when I got the news, I shed a tear,” said Hodgkinson. “I’ve worked so hard for this moment and was in the best shape of my life. I’m absolutely gutted that I won’t be able to race for the fans, especially after so many have bought tickets to see me try and break the world record.”Hodgkinson still hopes to compete in the world indoor championships in China in five weeks’ time, however a statement from her management group, Forte, admitted there were “questions about her ability to compete again this winter”.In the meantime, she will attend the Keely Klassic to cheer on other British stars, including the 1500m Olympic bronze medallist Georgia Bell and the world indoor pole vault champion Molly Caudery.“This event was never just about me – it was always about showcasing British talent, creating something new for the sport, and bringing more energy and entertainment to athletics,” said Hodgkinson, who had set up the event herself with the help of Forte. “That’s something I’m committed to for the long term.“I’ll be in Birmingham on Saturday doing everything I can to make sure it’s an amazing night for the athletes and the fans. I want to help create a real festival atmosphere, engage with as many young people as possible, and hopefully inspire the next generation to fall in love with track and field.”Hodgkinson’s absence will, however, spare the blushes of theBBCwhich before her injury had already decided not to show her world record attempt on its main terrestrial channels.Instead it had chosen to show Mr Malcolm’s List, a film it aired as recently as October 2024, and a repeat of Flog It! on BBC Two instead - with the Keely Klassic event relegated to its iPlayer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 51-year-old was placed under formal investigation in France last Wednesday, in relation to a case surrounding a Paris-based media company, for alleged complicity in vote-buying, interference with the freedom to vote and complicity in abuse of power, as part of a wider case involving the businessman Arnaud Lagardère. Khelaifi denies wrongdoing.QSI sold a 12.5% stake in PSG to Arctos Sports Partners, an American investment group, in December 2023. That deal was framed as a means of bolstering the club’s ability to compete at European level and the ­Guardian understands QSI would entertain lessening its involvement as part of a wider move to focus on projects outside France.Khelaifi, whose other roles include the influential position of European Club Association chairman, is being investigated in connection with a complex case involving Lagardère Group, which had longstanding business interests in sport. It surrounds an internal power struggle in 2018 between the wealthy board members Vincent Bolloré and Bernard Arnault. The latter was a supporter of Arnaud Lagardère. The PSG chairman’s proximity owed to his role on the board of Qatar Investment Authority, whose subsidiary Qatar Holding LLC was the main shareholder of Lagardère Group.QIA had originally sided with resolutions tabled by Bolloré’s Amber Capital investment fund in the dispute. It is claimed that, five days after the Lagardère Group board held its first vote on the matter, QIA switched position and voted for governance resolutions put forward by Lagardère. He and his allies are alleged to have called contacts, including Khelaifi, before that change of heart.The investigation comes two and a half years after Khelaifi was cleared of corruption in a caseregarding World Cup media rights. He was also cleared in February 2023 after a corruption investigation into Qatar’s bid for the 2017 World Athletics Championships.Part of a QIA statement in reaction to the Lagardère case read: “Mr al-Khelaifi had no substantive role in this matter nor made any decisions in this regard. Day-to-day matters involving companies into which QIA has made an investment are handled by its executives, not by members of QIA’s board such as Nasser al-Khelaifi … Accordingly [al-Khelaifi] was not in any position to influence, or to take any action on behalf of, QIA involving the company Lagardère.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the new season beginning next month, the British driver said he relished the chance to take on the Dutchman and was confident with the right machinery he could stamp his authority on a challenge for the title.Norris, who was second behind Verstappen last season, taking four wins, was speaking at the unveiling of hisMcLarenteam’s new challenger for 2025, the MCL39. At Silverstone, where he drove the car for the first time during a promotional filming day, the 25-year-old insisted he would face down Verstappen’s uncompromising style.“I need to get my elbows out, need to show him that I am not going to willingly give him any positions,” he said. “But I am also going to be a smart driver.”‘Best feelings of my life’: Lewis Hamilton makes test debut for new team FerrariRead moreLast year McLaren challenged Verstappen and Red Bull after upgrades deployed at the Miami GP proved to be enormously effective and whereNorris took his debut F1 win.He fought Verstappen for the title but was unable to overcome the points advantage the Dutchman had amassed early in the season.The two went wheel to wheel with one another repeatedly, notably in Austria, Austin and Mexico, with the Dutchman firm in his approach, including controversially forcing Norris off track. However the British driver has also admitted that he made mistakes.“There’s some things where I just didn’t do a good enough job,” he said. “I wasn’t simply quite at the level that I need to be to race against Max, but when we’re talking about that, we’re talking about probably going up against one of the hardest attacking-defence guys you can ever go up against.”Norris, who is entering his seventh season in F1 this year, was nonetheless confident in the lessons learned from 2024 he knew what it would take to challenge Verstappen.“You have to be a smart driver to go up against Max, so I look forward to it,” he said. “I like those moments when you have to make those quick decisions, and it’s always a lot harder when you’re in the car than when you re-watch it after and you think: ‘why the hell have I done that, what an idiot’.”“At the same time, I don’t need to go out and prove something to him. I don’t need to take any unnecessary risks, and I don’t need to go down trying. I don’t think you have to do anything special to try and beat Max. You have to be smart and also think of the long game sometimes.”View image in fullscreenLando Norris is held aloft by the McLaren team after his maiden F1 win in Miami last year.Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APNorris and his teammate, the Australian Oscar Piastri, did return consistently strong results last season ensuring McLaren took theirfirst constructors’ championship for 26 years.The team principal, Andrea Stella, who has been instrumental in returning McLaren to the sharp end of the grid, was confident the British driver was ready to fight for the title if they deliver a competitive car.“He definitely has all the qualities, the skills, the mindset to become a world champion,” he said. “I have seen Lando growing through [last] season at a very fast rate. He was already an incredible driver and he showed it immediately in Miami as soon as he had the car to win in, he delivered. He has been a very consistent driver, look at the number of podiums and points scored, he scored as much as Max from Miami onwards.”Last season with Norris in position to challenge Verstappen in the latter stages, McLaren did employ team orders on Piastri to favour the British driver but Stella reiterated the team would open the season once more on a level playing field, allowing them to race.“I look forward to having this kind of challenge, it means we are doing well as a team, the drivers are doing well, and the car is competitive and we did a good job,” he said. “In terms of how we will manage that, we start with equal opportunities with our racing principles and good talks with our drivers.”McLaren will reveal the new season’s livery, alongside the other nine teams, at the F1 75 showcase event to be held in London next Tuesday. Testing will take place in Bahrain on 26-28 February with the season opener in Melbourne on 16 March.Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisMcLarenFormula OneMotor sportMax VerstappenRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

Many, for example, still envisage the perfect No 10 to be an impish genius and, ideally,Welsh. Those who do not quite fit the mould – particularly those taking over from a recently departed legend – have to work doubly hard to shift entrenched perceptions.Dan Biggar, Wales’s most-capped fly-half, was instructive on the subject in his thought-provoking autobiography, The Biggar Picture. “Throughout my career I’d constantly had to silence the critics. I was too slow. I stood too deep. I was petulant, aggressive and one-dimensional. I kicked too much and ran too little. I was, in short, not your typical Welsh fly-half. Where Barry John would paint you a picture, I’d draw you a diagram.”Was England’s win a watershed moment for Borthwick or a fleeting slice of joy?Read moreThere were times, he said, when his famous red No 10 jersey resembled both suit of armour and straitjacket. “It can imbue you with Herculean strength or weigh you down with crippling anxiety.” An observation well worth keeping in mind when considering the new breed of young pretenders jostling for position in theSix Nationsthis season.Take Sam Prendergast for Ireland. A mere 22 years old, he at least has the advantage of looking like his esteemed predecessor,Johnny Sexton. Tall, calm and adept at looping round to offer another midfield attacking option, he has clearly been taking lessons from the former Ireland captain. “He’s been a master of control,” Ronan O’Gara said approvingly, having watched him give an assured performanceagainst Scotland on Sundayin his first Test away from home.Quick GuideRFU executives' bonuses deemed 'appropriate'ShowAn independent review has concluded that a scheme which saw the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, and other executives receive sizeable bonuses was \"an appropriate renumeration structure\".The report, commissioned by the RFU and carried out by law firm Freshfields, said: \"In our view the LTiP was an appropriate remuneration structure for the RFU to introduce in 2021, given the RFU's objectives at that time\".The bonus scheme – long-term incentive plan (LTiP) – was set up to persuade executives to remain at Twickenham during the post-pandemic era.But a special general meeting of the RFU will take place on 27 March, at which Sweeney will face calls for his removal from rebel clubs angered by the bonus and pay outcry that has engulfed Twickenham since last November.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Some, on the other hand, would still be minded to select Munster’s Jack Crowley ahead of Prendergast if it was their decision. Crowley was excellent, along with the rest of the Irish bench, when hecame on against England in Dublin. It is quite possible the two 10s will compete for the same jersey for years, the latest instalment of that particular shamrock-embossed soap opera. Ollie Campbell v Tony Ward, David Humphreys v O’Gara, O’Gara v Sexton … it is an age-old storyline.Times, though, are subtly changing. Rugby is a 23-man sport these days and possessing the composure to finish off tight games is becoming ever more critical. And how the game is speeding up, physically and tactically, makes it helpful to have two, or even three, playmakers on the pitch. Hence why England were happy to pick Marcus Smith at 15 against France, despite the Harlequin not being a natural full-back.But does that still matter to the same degree? Increasingly pivotal, at the top level, is finding the right collective blend. It has little to do with whether Fin Smith is a better player individually than Marcus Smith.Or vice versa. It is absolutely about what makes the team tick most effectively and maximises the talent they possess.And against France last Saturdayany backline student with eyes could see England looked more balanced and composed with Fin Smith at 10 than has latterly been the case.View image in fullscreen‘It can imbue you with Herculean strength or weigh you down with crippling anxiety,’ Dan Biggar wrote of the Wales No 10 jersey.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThis is hardly what Marcus Smith – or his agent – will want to hear. But, equally, it need not be the beginning of the end for his Test career. He simply has to get his head around the fact that, in future, his role is likely to be different and potentially involve a double-digit number beginning with a two on his back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And the last thing tiring defenders want to see is a fresh-legged Smith twisting them one way and then the other. A couple of quick long passes out the back, allied to eager, intelligent support, and he could be a truly devastating second-half threat, with Fin Smith calmly pulling the tactical strings from set pieces and starter plays.There is just one snag. England also need to pick their best starting XV, currently George Furbank when he recovers from injury. Not only is he a smart footballer but he has a cricketer’s hands and an established rapport with Fin Smith and their Northampton teammates Tommy Freeman and Ollie Sleightholme. In time it would be no surprise to see someone such as George Hendy, another Saint, whistled up. Not because any of them are better than Marcus Smith but because, early on in tight games against the best opposition, a specialist full-back is non-negotiable.Which potentially frees him up to be a rugby revolutionary: a new breed of world-class game-breaker, a pinch hitter with a licence to thrill. If he can work hard on his passing and box kicking so that, if needed, he is also able to pop up at scrum-half, so much the better. England may even then be able, if required, to name a seven-one bench. And while Smith might still look like a diminutive fly-half from central casting he could become the catalyst who transforms global perceptions.Shirt numbers – even double-digit ones starting with a two – are less important than the match-turning impact you make.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2025Six NationsRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How drought and a youth exodus threaten Mexico’s prized cocoaRead moreThe decline has resulted in an increase in the price of cocoa, which is produced from the beans of the cacao tree and is the main ingredient in chocolate.A new report found that “climate change, due primarily to burning oil, coal and methane gas, is causing hotter temperatures to become more frequent” in places such as theIvory Coast, Ghana, Cameroon and Nigeria.The study, by the independent research groupClimate Central, found the trend was particularly marked in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the two biggest cacao producers.Using data from 44 cacao-producing areas in west Africa and computer models, the researchers compared today’s temperatures with a counterfactual of a world not affected by global heating.The researchers looked at the likelihood of these regions facing temperatures in excess of 32C (89.6 F) – above levels considered optimum for cacao trees.The report calculated that over the last decade, global heating had added an extra three weeks of temperatures exceeding 32C in Ivory Coast andGhanaduring the main growing season between October and March.Last year, the hottest year globally on record, they found global heating drove temperatures above 32C on at least 42 days across two thirds of the areas analysed.Researchers said “excessive heat can contribute to a reduction in the quantity and quality of the harvest”.Many other factors were potentially harming cacao trees and boosting prices, they noted, including mealybug infestations, rainfall patterns, smuggling and illegal mining.Christian Aid published separate research this week on the vulnerability of chocolate and cacao farmers to weather changes driven by global heating.The UK charity said conditions in west Africa had changed dramatically due to extreme rainfall and spoiled crops during the dry season in 2023 and the drought in 2024.“Growing cocoa is a vital livelihood for many of the poorest people around the world and human-caused climate change is putting that under serious threat,” said Osai Ojigho, the director of Christian Aid’s policy and public campaigns.Failed harvests had helped drive a significant rise in cocoa prices since late 2023 on the London and New York markets where the commodity is traded.New York cocoa prices were more than $10,000 a tonne on Wednesday, below a peak of more than $12,500 in mid-December. New York prices have largely hovered between $2,000 and $3,000 a tonne for decades.In January, the Swiss chocolate maker, Lindt & Sprüngli, said it would raise prices again this year to offset rising cocoa costs.Narcisa Pricope, a professor at Mississippi State University, said the crop faced an “existential threat” largely because of increasingly dry conditions in cacao-producing regions.Pricope was part of recent research from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification that found more thanthree-quarters of the Earth’s landmasshad become drier over the past 30 years.The emissions of greenhouse gases were the biggest cause of this aridity, she said, but practices that degraded soils and nature also played an important role.“Collective action against aridity isn’t just about saving chocolate – it’s about preserving the planet’s capacity to sustain life,” she said.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisWest African food and drinkFoodAfricaResearchIvory CoastGhananewsShareReuse this content"

Thiscould shrink wildlife refuges and national monuments, which are protected lands designated by the president. Trump slashed the size of two vast national monuments in Utah when last in office.“Today marks the beginning of an exciting chapter for the department of the interior,” said Doug Burgum, interior secretary, at the unveiling of theseven-page directivelast week.“We are committed to working collaboratively to unlock America’s full potential in energy dominance and economic development to make life more affordable for every American family while showing the world the power of America’s natural resources and innovation.”But critics argue that endangered species will be steamrolled under this agenda, and the Endangered Species Act imperilled. The legislation has helped safeguard more than 1,700 species and their habitats,preventing 99%of those listed from going extinct, most famously the bald eagle.View image in fullscreenThe Sacramento River in the north delta, California. Trump has attacked California’s water policies, including protections for the delta smelt.Photograph: Mette Lampcov/The GuardianHowever, a lack of resources has stymied many listed species from a full recovery and opponents of the act claim that it has unduly blocked economic development. Trump recentlyrailed against protections afforded to the delta smelt, a small, unassuming creature in California that the president called an “essentially worthless fish”.The last Trump administration demanded economic considerations be weighed when deciding upon endangered species listings, contrary to the text of the act. It listed just 25 species for protection during its first term, the lowest of any administration, and refused petitions to protect species such as wolverines and hellbender salamanders.“Burgum and Trump are strapping dynamite to basic rules that protect our natural world,” says Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity.[The God squad] has the power of life and death over a speciesPatrick Parenteau“Even as imperilled species dwindle and vanish across America, this order will fan the flames of the extinction crisis. If it’s fully implemented, Burgum’s order threatens to leave future generations with a greatly impoverished, hotter planet. It’s monumentally shortsighted,” he says.A ‘God squad’ to decide protections for speciesOne of Trump’s first executive orders after returning to the White House in January shows, though, that he is prepared to further escalate an overhaul of endangered species laws, experts say. The order,which declared a national energy emergencyeven amid a record glut of oil and gas drilling, calls for the endangered species committee, a group nicknamed the “God squad”, to meet at least quarterly.View image in fullscreenPresident Donald Trump speaks to reporters accompanied by interior secretary Doug Burgum and Burgum’s wife, Kathryn Burgum, onboard Air Force One where Trump signed a proclamation declaring 9 February Gulf of America Day.Photograph: Ben Curtis/APThis committee, which would be led by Burgum, five other senior officials from different government agencies and a representative from an affected state, has rarely been used but has the power to override the Endangered Species Act even if it results in the extinction of a species, hence its existential nickname.“It has the power of life and death over a species,” says Patrick Parenteau, an environmental law expert at Vermont Law School who was involved in writing the legislative language for the God squad in the late 1970s. “It can allow a project to go ahead and expatriate a species from the face of the Earth.”The committee can only be convened through a stringent set of conditions, including a requirement that an exemption to the act can only be taken due to some sort of national emergency. The panel has never decided to kill off a species without some other ameliorating settlement in place, Parenteau said, with the body last meeting in 1992 to decide the fate of the spotted owl, menaced by logging in the Pacific north-west.“They have never actually pulled that lever of extinction, until now,” says Parenteau. “Invoking a fictional energy emergency is not grounds for short-changing the consultation process, there’s no way of meeting those requirements legally. This is about throwing shit against the wall to see what sticks, while distracting us from all the other endangered species rules Trump is repealing.”View image in fullscreenA wild eastern screech owl using camouflage to protect its home and ambush its prey, in Florida, US.Photograph: Media Drum World/AlamyEven if the squad isn’t able to sweep aside wildlife protections, environmental groups fear a broader assault is under way against the protections of species in several states that will find strong support from the Trump administration.The Republican-led states of Montana and Wyoming both unsuccessfully asked the federal government, during Joe Biden’s term, toremove protectionsfrom grizzly bears, while Republican members of Congress have backed abill similarly strippinggrey wolves from the endangered species list.“Grey wolves are threatening the livelihoods of our ranchers and farmers with attacks on livestock because our agriculture community has their hands tied by out-of-date policies and progressive legal activism,” Lauren Boebert, a Republican congresswoman, has said.If Trump wins the election, US parks and wildlife will face a new age of miningRead moreSuch moves may succeed with Trump in the White House, but species could also die out because of neglect from the federal government, Parenteau says. Programmes to recover species are chronically underfunded and private landowners, who host many of the last individuals of certain species, are unlikely to be incentivised in the coming term to safeguard those animals.“Without the Endangered Species Act, many species would go extinct,” says Parenteau. “But if the act isn’t being implemented and enforced, of course those species won’t recover. Weakening that law is a recipe for extinction. Extinction is a process not a destination but a lot of species will reach a point of no return under Trump.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe age of extinctionDonald TrumpConservationEndangered speciesBiodiversityFossil fuelsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, farmers and miners are draining the peatlands, releasing so much CO2that if they were a country, they would be the fourth biggest polluter in the world after China, the US and India.The first global assessment found that only 17% of the peatlands were within protected areas. This contrasted starkly with other valuable ecosystems such as tropical forests, where 38% were protected, and mangroves (42%).Protection was even lower than the 17% average in the three nations with the most peatlands: Canada, Russia and Indonesia. The US and Brazil completed the top five nations, which contained almost three-quarters of all peatlands, and had higher proportions in protected areas. But the researchers cautioned that protected status on a map did not always translate to strong protection on the ground.Top 10 peatland nations by area - only 17% of global peatlands are in protected areasThe scientists said conserving and restoring peatlands was essential to keeping global heating below internationally agreed targets and limiting the damage to lives and livelihoods.Almost a quarter of peatlands are under heavy pressure from human activities.However, action to defend peatlands was a cost-effective way of tackling the climate crisis, the researchers said, and a quarter were within Indigenous peoples’ lands, which have been shown to sufferless environmental degradationthan elsewhere.Peatlands were “ultra-high-value ecosystems”, said Dr Kemen Austin at the Wildlife Conservation Society, who ledthe study– but levels of protection were “dangerously low”. Peatlands not only store carbon, but also trap water, helping to prevent floods and droughts, and harbour many mosses and flowers, birds, fish and butterflies. “Their value for people, both locally and at the global scale, is just enormous,” she said.“The carbon in peatlands took hundreds to thousands of years to accumulate and cannot be replaced on timescales relevant to climate change action,” Austin said. “That’s why peatlands are sometimes referred to as a carbon bomb, because once you ignite that bomb, those emissions are going to continue, and we’re not getting that carbon back.”However, because peatlands are a very carbon-dense ecosystem, “the bang for the buck is really high when we think about protecting them”, she said.Peatlands, also called bogs, fens, swamps, mires and muskeg, are wetlands where dead plant matter accumulates and decomposition is slow due to the material being waterlogged. However, draining or disturbing peatlands for farming, mining or roads and other infrastructure exposes the carbon to the air and leads to CO2being released into the atmosphere. In total, the carbon stored in peatlands is equivalent to more than half a century’s worth of current global emissions.Global map of peatlands under threat from human encroachmentThe study,published in the journal Conservation Letters, analysed the proportion of peatlands that were in various types of protected areas. While 17% were in some kind of protected area, only about half of that was considered strictly protected. In the Republic of the Congo, almost 90% of peatlands fell within protected areas, but less than 1% had strict protection.In the UK, which ranked 12th in the world by area of peatland, 41% fell in protected areas. Along with Indonesia, the UK was one of the few countries to have a comprehensive peatland strategy to support its national climate plans, the researchers said. However, about80% of the bogsin the UK were already degraded by draining, overgrazing andburning.Bog ugly, but totally magnificent: peatlands are finally getting the respect they deserve | Sophie YeoRead moreThe researchers said expanding protected areas was important for safeguarding peatlands but that the management and financing of existing protected areas had to improve as many were poorly funded. Environmental regulations that protected land from damaging exploitation would also help, as would improving the land rights of Indigenous peoples, especially where peatland protection was being linked to the selling of carbon credits.There are also important opportunities in 2025 to add peatland protection and restoration to national climate and biodiversity plans that countries must submit to UN bodies.Prof Chris Evans, at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said the study was important: “Peatlands are often overlooked, not helped by the fact that they are typically flat, wet, often inaccessible, not always picturesque and, unlike forests, the gigatonnes of carbon they hold are hiding below the surface.”He said even peatland now being farmed could be improved byreducing the depth of drainage, a measure that had the potential to reduce global emissions by about 2% while keeping the land in agricultural use.Prof Heiko Balzter, at the University of Leicesterin the UK, said: “There is a risk we might lose the peatland carbon sink.” He said theheatwaves and droughts being worsened by global heatingitself also threatened the viability of peatlands: “That is one more reason to protect them quickly.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisConservationGreenhouse gas emissionsBiodiversityResearch publishingPeer review and scientific publishingnewsShareReuse this content"

The government has pledged to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060. But experts fear those targets will remain out of reach as long asit keeps approving new coal productionand prioritising coal-fired power.“Coal-fired power generation could decline, yet the coal industry continues to expect growth, setting the stage for an increasingly unsustainable conflict between coal investments and the need to decarbonise the power system,” the report said. It found China had shown an “unprecedented pace” of renewables production in 2024, adding 356GW of wind and solar capacity. The figure was almost equal to the US total for the same year, and about 4.5 times that of the EU.Despite solar and wind soaring, and helping drive China’s ailing economy in 2023-2024, its usage inexplicably dropped off in the later part of the year, CREA said.View image in fullscreenCoal waits to be transported at Guoyuan Port container terminal in Chongqing, China, on 12 January 2025.Photograph: Costfoto/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock“The record decline in solar output and the unexpected drop in wind utilisation was not explained by weather conditions, indicating rising curtailment – much of which may be unreported,” it said. Qi Qin, lead author of the report and China analyst at CREA, said curtailments were driven largely by long-term power purchase agreements that set minimum quotas for coal power bought by local governments.“China started to do [these agreements] in 2020 for energy security, to ensure there will be enough power throughout the year at reasonable price,” said Qin.“More solar and wind should be integrated into the power grid, but the fact is it wasn’t [because of these agreements].”China’s rate of approvals for new coal energy was also of concern, the report said.In 2024 China also approved 66.7GW of new coal-fired capacity, started construction on 94.5GW of new coal power projects – the most in one year since 2015 – and resumed construction on 3.3GW of suspended construction projects. One gigawatt is the equivalent of a large coal power plant. The report said China accounted for 93% of global construction starts for coal power in 2024.The approvals, while lower than previous years, sped up in the latter half of 2024, dampening hopes thatan earlier slowdown– just 9GW worth of power plants were given permits in the first half of 2024 – signalled China was turning a corner.The amount of actual coal power capacity brought online in 2024 – about 30GW – was far below the government’s target of 80GW, but Qin said the new construction signalled China would more than make up for it over the next two to three years, with a “substantial” number of new plants on track to start production.Qin said some of the figures in their analysis were positive “but it’s not good enough”.“China knows that it has two carbon goals, and it knows they have to stop increasing coal consumption by 2025. With the abundance of renewables, China has the capacity to move even faster.”The concurrent growth in clean energy production and continued pursuit of coal-fired power created a “conflicting dynamic” and worked against a principle of winding down the fossil fuel industry as renewables came onboard, including by limiting the full integration and use of the new renewable power, CREA said.“Coal and clean energy are increasingly competing for space in China’s power system,” it said. “Despite record-breaking clean energy additions, Chinas power sector remains structurally misaligned with its decarbonisation goals. The parallel expansion of coal and renewables risks undermining China’s clean energy transition.”Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificSolar powerCoalEnergyFossil fuelsRenewable energyShareReuse this content"

The result of that consultation will ultimately decide whether such projects are allowed to take place.It can now be revealed there are more oil and gas projects whose futures hang in the balance. In an exchange with the Green MP Carla Denyer, the energy minister Michael Shanks was forced to admit that 13 oil and gas fields currently at consent phase are subject to the recentcourt ruling.A number of Labour MPs told the Guardian earlier this month that they believed there would be significant resistance in the party if the guidance ultimately led to the drilling being allowed to go ahead at Rosebank.But Shanks told parliament this week that the impact of the court ruling was likely to extend beyond Rosebank and Jackdaw. He said “existing licences will be honoured, and we will not remove licences from fields that already have a licence.“However, consents – the point at which extraction takes place – must take into account climate tests, and not least the compatibility test laid down by the supreme court. Any applications now or in future must take account of that.”A source at the Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero said licences that were at “consent level” would be subject to this consultation which is being helmed by Miliband.The result of that consultation may preclude the development of new oil and gas projects in the North Sea, the source said, but would depend how far along they were in their application phase. Government datashows there are 13licences at that stage.The guidance will cover how companies can account for “scope three emissions” – those caused by burning fossil fuels. It comes after a landmark case last year which set a precedent that these emissions have to be accounted for in planning applications.This guidance is under consultation but it is expected to set out how scope three emissions can be recorded and accounted for, and if they can be mitigated.Climate experts including Tessa Khan at Uplift, who brought the successful case against Rosebank, have argued that no scope three emissions are acceptable and that allowing new oil and gas fields would breach the UK’s climate goals.Alexander Kirk, a fossil fuels campaigner at Global Witness, said the consultation should result in the cancellation of all the new licences in the pipeline. He added: “What the vast majority of people in the UK want is energy that’s cheap and clean, like wind and solar.Fossil fuelsare dirty, expensive, and we know that they’re turbo-charging climate breakdown.“If this government wants to stay true to its climate promises, it must cancel all new licences. From the LA wildfiresto devastating floods closer to home – from Leicestershire to Valencia–our climate is reaching boiling point. Our politicians must do what they can to prevent further damage and that means keeping oil and gas in the ground.”A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “Fields with a licence but not yet consented may be awaiting additional guidance before determining whether to proceed with their developments – this depends where they are in the regulatory process.“However, this is a commercial matter for the relevant companies.”Explore more on these topicsOilGreen politicsEnergyFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

Rayner is said to have replied: “I’ll deal with it in my own time.”It is understood that Rayner has no recollection of being shown the image but does not dispute being told that people were making personal comments about her.There is no suggestion that she knew about the specific racist or homophobic comments before they were published by the Mail on Sunday at the weekend.A Labour party spokesperson said: “As soon as this group was brought to our attention, a thorough investigation was immediately launched and this process is ongoing in line with the Labour party’s rules and procedures.“Swift action will always be taken where individuals are found to have breached the high standards expected of them as Labour party members.”The Guardian has learned that senior Labour figures were told several times by at least three councillors about theoffensive messages, dating back to at least 2022.Labour sources said no formal complaint was ever made about the WhatsApp group, calledTrigger Me Timbers, and that concerns were raised as part of wider frustrations about Gwynne and his perceived meddling in the local party.Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, was told by Gerald Cooney, the then-leader of Tameside council, that Gwynne had made unflattering remarks about Rayner but is not thought to have been given more detail.However, the fact that the concerns about unprofessional remarks by a senior politician were escalated several times raises questions about whether Labour could have investigated sooner.Gwynne was sacked as a health minister and suspended from the party along with the Burnley MP, Oliver Ryan, after racist, sexist and homophobic posts came to light on Saturday.Keir Starmer dismissed him as a minister as soon as he became aware of the comments, it is understood.Elevenlocal councillors have also been suspended, including Gwynne’s wife, Allison Gwynne, and his senior caseworker, Claire Reid, who sits on Labour’s national policy forum. Reid set up the Trigger Me Timbers group in January 2019.Gwynne, the MP for Gorton and Denton in Greater Manchester, shared a tweet about Rayner claiming for Apple AirPods on expenses which contained a lewd comment.Rayner was told about the post by a local councillor in her constituency of Ashton-under-Lyne in 2022, it is understood.The councillor is said to have told the MP that a “derogatory” comment had been made about her by Gwynne on a WhatsApp group of local party figures. The councillor said he was concerned the actions of Gwynne and those close to him “could potentially stop us getting into government”.Rayner is said to have replied: “We will deal with this at the right time.”A second councillor, who was outraged by the comments being made in the group, later showed the deputy leader the offensive post about her. Rayner is said to have replied: “I’ll deal with it in my own time.”The Guardian revealed this week that two senior Labour party officials had been told about the offensive posts, with the first warning “well over a year ago” to Liam Didsbury, then the party’s regional director for north-westEngland.In texts revealed this week, Gwynne said he hoped a 72-year-old who didn’t vote Labour “croaked it” before the next election, and that he had “positive visions” of a local cycling campaigner being “mown down” by a lorry, adding: “We couldn’t be that lucky!”Gwynne, who was shadow communities secretary for three years under Corbyn’s leadership, also described someone as having a name that sounded “too militaristic and too Jewish”, asking if he was “in Mossad”, the Israeli intelligence agency.The texts show that he described a constituent as “an illiterate retard” and a fellow councillor as a “fat middle aged useless thicket”.Gwynne said on Saturday: “I deeply regret my badly misjudged comments and apologise for any offence I’ve caused. I’ve served the Labour party all my life and it was a huge honour to be appointed a minister by Keir Starmer.“I entirely understand the decisions the PM and the party have taken and, while very sad to have been suspended, will support them in any way I can.”Explore more on these topicsLabourGreater ManchesterAngela RaynerNorth of EnglandEnglandLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

The labourers had to use dangerous gangplanks to unload Welsh coal imported on the island.The Postal Museum commissioned the research, which was supported byDr Anyaa Anim-Addo, an academic adviser, and it is part of a new exhibition about the postal industry’s connections with the slavery economy.Joanna Espin, a senior curator at the museum, said the research showed how the global postal service and its connected companies were “a tool of empire” rather than just a communication source.She said: “By ‘steaming’ its ships outside the British empire where slavery hadn’t been abolished, the RMSPC was able to exploit slave labour on the island. It is a complex story but we’re trying to show the choices made by the business and the way that the company benefited by exploiting enslaved labour.”The exhibition features postcards, letters, paintings and clothing from the era, alongside correspondence between UK plantation owners and Caribbean managers discovered in the museum’s archives.Letters from two enslaved women who secured freedom through manumission and protested against working conditions also feature in the exhibition, which is called Voices of Resistance: Slavery and Post in the Caribbean andopens in April.The exhibition has been created with Dollar fo’ Dollar, a St Thomas-based organisation, which researches and raises awareness of the island’s coal workers.Ayesha Morris, of Dollar fo’ Dollar, said her organisation wanted to “spread awareness of the memories of those who, basket by basket, fuelled steamships coming into the St Thomas harbour for about a century, who courageously fought for better wages and working conditions”.RMSPC, which wasfounded in Liverpool, was one of the most significant British companies of the Victorian era. It collapsed after what one writer called one of “the greatest frauds in history”.At the company’s 1920 annual general meeting, its leadership boasted that RMSPC was “carrying ocean trades in practically all parts of the world”, and a few years later the company’s ships carried 1.4 million passengers, transported nearly 14m tonnes of cargo and employed more than 35,000 people on its vessels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trouble flared at a meeting in May last year when Pease, a former RAF squadron leader, was called on to give his ward councillor’s report, according to the investigation.Darling began reading a long list of prepared questions to Pease with the conversation becoming heated because Darling was asking them “in a raised voice and provoking manner” and not allowing time to answer.Pease then stood up, pointed his finger on the table and called Darling “a prat … before going towards the door to exit the room”.According to Darling’s wife, Pease said: “Why are you sticking your nose in”, “you can carry on running your own little fiefdom without me” and, finally, “I’m not listening to that prat” before heading to the door.The report says there is a dispute about who started it “and who assaulted who”.Pease accused Darling of “grabbing him round the neck, head-butting his nose resulting in blood on his shirt with cuts and bruises on his collarbone and arms”.Darling denied this saying Pease “punched him first”. He suffered a bruised finger.According to the meeting’s chair, Hazel Bullock, it was Darling who “set upon” Pease who reciprocated “with both men being locked in a very physical exchange of attempted punches and hair pulling”.Another councillor said Darling went towards Pease in a “rugby-type tackle” and it “was like a wrestling match”.Another said there was “lot of pushing and shoving” and both parties were as responsible as the other. One witness said: “Darling flung his arm around CP’s neck and punched him three times in the face.” Another said the men were just “ragging each other around”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They include Bullock saying “for goodness sake have some dignity David stop” and another person saying “no, hey Colin, Colin, Colin stop it.”One witness is heard shouting: “David you will end up having a stroke doing that, sit down.”The investigator, Ellie Dewar, says in the report: “The majority of evidence supports a view that councillor Darling initiated the physical altercation by grabbing hold of councillor Pease’s neck. This led to punches being thrown. In my view councillor Pease has acted in reasonable and proportionate self-defence in trying to get his attacker off him.”The report says it will be for members of the council’s standards committee, meeting on Monday, to decide if code of conduct provisions have been breached.Both men have been approached for comment. Pease told the Guardian he would save his comment for Monday’s meeting.Explore more on these topicsNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

People with his eloquence and intellectual range are all too rare – he will be sadly and widely missed.”Sir Paul Nurse, the Nobel laureate who will become president of the Royal Society for the second time later this year, called Radford “an excellent writer”, adding: “We will all miss him.”Radford was born in New Zealand in 1940 and educated at Sacred Heart college in Auckland. He joined the New Zealand Herald as a reporter at the age of 16 and moved to the UK in 1961. After a brief spell as a Whitehall information officer, he spent the rest of his career in newspapers, joining the Guardian as a subeditor in 1973. He worked as the letters editor, arts editor and literary editor before becoming the science editor in 1992.Claire Armitstead, a former literary editor at the Guardian, said: “Tim was the best sort of journalist: infinitely inquisitive and excited by the hugeness and variety of the universe, and indulgent of those who lacked his ability to comprehend it.”Radford won Association of British Science Writers awards four times and received a lifetime achievement award in 2004, the first year it ran. The following year the award went to Sir David Attenborough.Beyond his journalism, Radford was a revered mentor to many up-and-coming writers. On being invited to do some media training, he bashed out25 commandmentsfor aspiring journalists. The rules remain required reading today. One urges writers to imagine a little sign on their desk that declares: “Nobody has to read this crap.”He offered more bespoke advice, too. When one journalist confessed to feeling paralysed by the responsibility of the job, he responded: “My experience of journalism is if you’re not hounded by fear, panic and a profound sense of inadequacy, then you’re doing it wrong. Complacency doesn’t get good stories written, ever.”He stressed the importance of simple words, clear ideas and short sentences, while not forgetting a sense of irreverence. In a demonstration of the latter, he reported on the Blair government’s long-awaited response to the risk of an asteroid clattering into the Earth:a new information centre to be built in Leicester.“He could talk as easily to Nobel laureates as he could undergraduates, and he could make any subject, however obscure, seem fascinating,” said Chris Mihill, a former medical correspondent at the Guardian. “He was a wonderful raconteur and could completely capture an audience, yet he always ended on a self-deprecating note. Then on the way out he would casually tell you why Shakespeare prefigured Wittgenstein by about 400 years.”Radford wrote three books: The Crisis of Life on Earth, The Address Book, and The Consolations of Physics. Will Francis, his agent at Janklow & Nesbit, said: “From age 16, leaping from a launch on to the gangway of a heaving cruise ship as it came into Auckland’s harbour to interview Robert Mitchum, to patrician science journalist, father figure to a whole generation of writers, Tim never lost his extraordinary combination of perspicacity and intellectual humility. As he said: ‘You begin any journalism with the understanding that it’s very easy to get things wrong.’”Alok Jha, the science and technology editor for the Economist, said: “Tim was the best of us, and such enormous fun. He not only knew about everything – from cosmic inflation to Neanderthal culture – but he effortlessly wove those strands of knowledge into magical, captivating stories. He was inexhaustible in his kindness, mentorship and support for many generations of writers and scientists who have wanted to help the world understand complex ideas.”Radford is survived by two children, a granddaughter and a great-granddaughter.Explore more on these topicsThe GuardianNew ZealandNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

He was given a seat in the House of Lords in order to become the government’s top law officer in July.He has now become a lightning rod for criticism from the Conservatives, who haveaccused him of potential conflicts of interest, and from some inside the Labour tent who see him as a blocker of legislative progress. He is subject to daily attacks in sections of the media over everything from his legal advice in government to his past client roster and the political views he has expressed on podcasts.Many government figures – including some at the Home Office and Foreign Office, departments that have worked closely with Hermer on drafting legislation – are baffled by the attacks and the implicit suggestion that the government should be less concerned about following the law. Senior ministers and advisers told the Guardian that rather than impeding it, the attorney general had helped fix poorly drafted legislation.Areas where Hermer is accused of slowing things down include the border security bill and theHillsborough law to establish a duty of candour for public officials. His critics, said to include members of the cabinet, say he is obsessed with process and that he dresses up political opinions as objective legal fact.Even those who have witnessed Hermer’s input lead to delays are surprised by the vitriol directed against him by government figures quoted anonymously in the press.“He has quite a strict approach – he doesn’t want ministers to take powers to be able to do things without parliament’s consent. But that’s obviously part of our commitment to good government,” said a senior source who has witnessed some of the tensions.Another senior government figure said the attacks against Hermer were “deeply unfair”, adding: “If you were a member of the cabinet who wanted to know how to deliver on this government’s missions while also navigating the law, you couldn’t ask for someone with more ability.”Insiders believe Hermer has become a sort of cipher for the prime minister and his approach. This week Maurice Glasman, the Blue Labour founder who has found new relevance through his friendship with the US vice-president, JD Vance,called Hermer“an arrogant, progressive fool who thinks that law is a replacement for politics”.It’s a criticism that Starmer – who hates this sort of vicious briefing – will have certainly heard levelled against himself. “I think there is some proxy work going on – having a go at the big man by having a go at [Hermer],” a well-connected seniorLabourfigure said. “They are very, very similar in many ways. There are some people who think, politically, we need to be more Blue Labour. And there’s a different strain which says: ‘This is government by lawyers for lawyers.’”Charles Falconer, the Labour peer who was Starmer’s shadow attorney general until 2021, said Hermer had become “a pawn” and “means of attacking the government for being lily-livered on various things”. He said Starmer had appointed him because “he wanted the best”.“The picture that is being painted of him as a madly progressive lawyer is inaccurate. He is essentially pragmatic and mainstream and will undoubtedly be trying to procure success for team Labour,” Falconer said. “If you’re going to take a tough line on immigration it is important to be doing it within the law – and [Starmer] wanted someone who would help him take as tough a line as possible.”Besides the claims about him slowing down legislation, Hermer has also faced criticism over foreign policy decisions, includinghanding sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritiusandsuspending some arms sales to Israel, to which his advice is said to have contributed.“He has been presented as anti-Israel,” one government source said. “That is not true at all. He speaks Hebrew, has a deep commitment to Jewish life and has family in the Israel Defense Forces.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has also come under scrutiny for defending thedisgraced human rights lawyer Phil Shinerwhile he was under investigation by the solicitors’ watchdog.Accusations of conflicts of interest – prosecuted chiefly by Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary – have so far come to nothing. The Guardian has seen a letter sent to a Tory MP by the prime minister’s independent ethics adviser this week saying there was no basis for an investigation. The Lords standards commissioner has also dismissed a complaint.Observers say that because of his political inexperience Hermer has not been nimble enough in responding to these attacks. He has now begun engaging in the more personal side of politics, including by informally meeting Labour MPs, particularly from the 2024 intake, for coffee.His critics will undoubtedly find new avenues to pursue, but Hermer’s allies say that far from buckling under the pressure, he will serve for as long as the prime minister wants him to. Eventually Starmer is likely to face a choice: back the attorney general against his internal detractors, or replace him.Asked by a Tory MP if he had “faith in [Hermer’s] motives” at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Starmer gave an impassioned defence.“Everybody’s entitled to legal representation in this country: that means that lawyers don’t necessarily agree with their clients. The Conservative party used to believe in that principle,” Starmer said. “If they now disagree with that principle they should go and see the victims of very serious crime, including sexual crime, and tell them that … victims will be cross-examined by perpetrators.”It would seem that, for now at least, Hermer isn’t going anywhere.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The basilica, at its heart, functioned as a kind of town hall, in which important political and judicial decisions were made.View image in fullscreenAn illustration of the first London forum, the Roman capital’s social and administrative hub.Illustration: Peter MarsdenIntriguingly, archaeologists believe the excavated section contains the tribunal, a designated part of the basilica where important officials would have sat on a raised stage to adjudicate on the main issues affecting the capital of the new Roman outpost.The structure was short-lived, however, being replaced in about AD100 by a much bigger forum built on the same site.Describing the find as “one of the most significant discoveries made in the city in recent years”, Sophie Jackson, the director of development at Mola, the Museum of LondonArchaeology, said: “It’s like discovering the speaker’s chair and chamber of the House of Commons, 2,000 years into the future. The levels of preservation of the basilica have far exceeded our expectations, and we have possibly the most important part of the building.View image in fullscreenArtist’s impression of a forum previously unearthed in Leicester.Photograph: Mike Codd/Leicester Museums and Galleries“Excitingly, we’ve only just scratched the surface of this site’s potential through our initial investigations.”The remains were discovered in 2023 as part of the redevelopment of an office building at 85 Gracechurch Street, next to the entrance to the historic Leadenhall market at the heart of the City of London.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To capitalise on this extraordinary discovery we have helped shape a new public display of the archaeological remains, offering a brand new visitor experience in the City.”Explore more on these topicsRoman BritainArchaeologyLondonHeritageEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The deal is expected to be completed by the end of 2025.Steve Madden said buying Kurt Geiger was “one of the great accomplishments” of his career, adding: “The brand is doing better and better every year, and the opportunity to collaborate with them is thrilling. I get goosebumps just thinking about it.”Madden, who started his footwear brand in 1990, served 31 months in prison for his involvement in securities fraud and money laundering related to his dealings with Stratton Oakmont, which underwrote his company’s flotation.

Tice promised to “scrap net stupid zero” if the party won the next general election.But Lowe, who owns Ravenswell Farm in Cheltenham, recently installed solar panels and battery storage systems on his land.Lowe’s Cotswolds farm hosts the training ground for the leading racehorse trainer Fergal O’Brien. His mechanical installations company Lowe & Oliver furnished the racing centre with renewable energy systems in order to save O’Brien money on electricity bills.Solar panels could cut fuel-poor UK families’ energy bills by 24%, says studyRead moreIn apost on the company’s websitecelebrating the successful installations, it wrote: ‘“Not surprisingly, the activities and operation of the premises use large amounts of electricity, and with tariffs rocketing … A solar-panel installation was seen as the most efficient option to bring down costs in the long term.”Lowe & Oliver added that “to maximise the self-consumption of the solar PV electricity generated on site, battery storage was also specified,” so they installed three batteries to store solar energy.The racing firm is expected to generate a third of its electricity from these panels, Lowe & Oliver said.Lowe told the Guardian he was “proud to be involved in a wide range of businesses, which gives me proper insight into how jobs are created and how wealth is generated”, adding: “If more MPs had such real life experience, the country wouldn’t be in such a sorry mess.“My view? Clean energy is incredibly important, but it should be generated in a responsible way that does not bankrupt the country and deindustrialise our economy – particularly at a time when China, India and others are charging through coal. Fracking and nuclear are key, and the failure to properly explore those options is a humiliation for the British establishment.

Employees of daycare centres, hospitals, sanitation facilities and public swimming pools had joined the work stoppage calling for higher pay and longer holidays. About 1,500 people were reportedly at the scene.Among those hurt were children, and some of the victims had critical injuries. Media images showed the damaged car and several bodies lying on the ground, which was strewn with shoes and stained with blood.Munich mapAt the height of a campaign for the 23 February election that has been dominated byfears around security and immigration, fuelling far-right support, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, condemned the car ramming as “terrible” and pledged a “no-tolerance” policy.“This assailant cannot expect any leniency,” he told reporters. “He must be punished and then leave the country.”Opposition leader Friedrich Merz said on X that as chancellor he would “impose law and order decisively”. “The security of people in Germany will be the top priority for us,” he said. “Everyone must feel safe again in our country. Something has got to change in Germany.”View image in fullscreenThe scene in Munich.Photograph: vifogra/Paul/EPAAlice Weidel, co-leader of the anti-immigration Alternative für Deutschland party (AfD), called the incident “awful” and countered that Merz’s party colleagues in Bavaria were to blame for a “failure of state” by not deporting the suspect. While listing the most recent attacks, she said on X: “Should this continue for ever? An about-face on migration, now!”The Bavarian capital had already begun implementing tighter security measures before the Munich Security Conference, starting on Friday, which will be attended by top officials from around the world including the US vice-president, JD Vance, and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Authorities said they did not believe the car ramming was connected to the conference.The news website Spiegel said the suspect, identified only as Farhad N, had arrived in Germany seeking asylum in December 2016 and cited sources saying he had posted Islamist content on social media before the incident.Bavaria’s state interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, said the suspect was known to police in connection with theft and drug offences, but later corrected the information, saying he had no criminal record and was living legally in Germany. Police said the man had worked in retail security and served as a witness in cases they were investigating.Police confirmed they had fired one shot while making the arrest but it was unclear whether the suspect was injured. “As reported, the secured person is the driver of the car,” police said on X. “Speculation is swirling about further people being involved. We cannot confirm that at this time.”The Munich-based Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported that one woman had died but authorities did not immediately comment.View image in fullscreenMembers of the emergency services at the scene.Photograph: Michaela Stache/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Munich mayor, Dieter Reiter, told the daily newspaperBild: “The police chief just informed me that a vehicle drove into a group of people and unfortunately many were injured, including children. I am deeply shocked. My thoughts are with those hurt.”Two months ago a car ramming at aChristmas market in the eastern German city of Magdeburgkilled six people. Police arrested a Saudi doctor who had frequently expressed far-right sympathies on social media.The Munich incident came as an Afghan man with suspected Islamist sympathies went on trial on charges of murder and attempted murder after a stabbing attack targeting a political rally last May in the western city of Mannheim. The defendant, identified by prosecutors as Sulaiman A, is accused of stabbing and seriously injuring six people, including a 29-year-old police officer who died of his injuries, during the attack on an anti-Islam demonstration.In August, a 26-year-old Syrian asylum seeker with Islamist sympathies allegedly carried outa stabbing rampage at a festival in the western city of Solingenthat left three dead and eight wounded.Last month a 28-year-old Afghan man was arrested aftera knife attack on children in a park in the southern city of Aschaffenburg, killing a two-year-old Moroccan boy and a 41-year-old German man who tried to intervene.Scholz noted the difficulty of deporting Afghan nationals because Germany does not have diplomatic relations with the ruling Taliban. But he stressed his centre-left-led government had taken measures to ensure more suspects accused of violent crimes could be returned to the war-ravaged country.During the election campaign, the centre-right and far right in particular have accused Scholz’s government of failing to stop immigrant crime, while Scholz has argued that the conservatives’ counterproposals would violate national and EU law.In the aftermath of the Aschaffenburg attack, the election frontrunner, Merz of the conservative CDU/CSU alliance, pressed for hardline measures to turn back irregular migrants at the border. In what was widely criticised as a breach of a post-Nazi taboo,Merz said he was willing to accept the support of the far-right AfDto get the proposals through parliament.The anti-Muslim AfD, which is under investigation as a suspected extremist organisation, is second in opinion polls at about 21%, behind the CDU/CSU on about 30%. All the mainstream parties have ruled out including the AfD in a governing coalition.View image in fullscreenA pram in the road after the attack.Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/ReutersSandra Demmelhuber, a journalist who had been reporting on the trade union strike in Munich, described shocked witnesses at the scene. “There is a person lying in the street and a young man was taken away by police,” she posted on X. “People are sitting crying and shaking on the ground. Details are still unclear.”Another witness told local media that the Mini struck a woman with a child. “The mother and child were lying under the car.”Claudia Weber, of the Verdi union, described the scene as “incomprehensible”. “We are completely shocked and are afraid for our colleagues who were at the march,” she said. “We heard that the car intentionally crashed into the demonstration. We hope no one will die.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not the guy with the backpacks when they cross the Rio Grande.”During her news conference, Sheinbaum also mentioned Mexico’s spat with Google Map’sdecision to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, apparently at the behest of Trump, noting that the government had exchanged correspondence with the tech giant.“If necessary, we will file a civil suit,” she said. “Even President Trump isn’t proposing that the entire Gulf of Mexico be called the ‘Gulf of America’, but only their continental shelf. So Google is wrong.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoUS-Mexico borderDrugs tradeOrganised crimeUS crimeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The video was set to an electronic version of “Hava Nagila”, a Jewish folk song that is typically played at celebratory cultural events, and ended with the slogan: “Enough is enough. Join the fight against antisemitism.”Other stars depicted included Sacha Baron Cohen, Jack Black, Natalie Portman, Adam Levine, Ben Stiller and Lenny Kravitz.“It has been brought to my attention by family members and friends, that an AI-generated video featuring my likeness, in response to an antisemitic view, has been circulating online and gaining traction,” Johansson saidin a statement to People.“I am a Jewish woman who has no tolerance for antisemitism or hate speech of any kind. But I also firmly believe that the potential for hate speech multiplied by AI is a far greater threat than any one person who takes accountability for it. We must call out the misuse of AI, no matter its messaging, or we risk losing a hold on reality.”West, now known as Ye, repeatedly referred to himself as a “Nazi” and praised Hitler on X before deactivating his account.He also appeared in an advert during the Super Bowl directing people to his website, which started selling only one product – T-shirts with swastikas on them. The site was later taken down by Shopify due to policy violations, while Fox Television Stations CEO, Jack Abernethy, alsocondemned the ad in a note to staff.Johansson has been one of the most vocal celebrities against the use of non-consensual AI. Last year shethreatened legal action against OpenAIafter the company used a voice resembling her own in its new ChatGPT product – nine months after she said she turned down the company’s request to voice their AI system.OpenAI eventually removed the heavily promoted voice option from ChatGPT after a widespread reaction.Johansson said she had been “a very public victim of AI, but the truth is that the threat of AI affects each and every one of us”.She added: “There is a 1,000-foot wave coming regarding AI that several progressive countries, not including the United States, have responded to in a responsible manner. It is terrifying that the US government is paralysed when it comes to passing legislation that protects all of its citizens against the imminent dangers of AI.”The actor urged elected officials to take legislative action against AI abuses, calling it a “bipartisan issue that enormously affects the immediate future of humanity at large”.Her comments come as the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority said fake adverts featuring celebritiesremain the most common type of scam advertsappearing online.The AI video was created by Ori Bejerano, who describes himself as a generative AI expert on hisInstagram bio.

It was voted through on Thursday as part of measures to improve flood and landslide protection.Une Bastholm, a Green member of parliament, described the proposal as “a historic attack on Norwegian nature” when it was unveiled last week.Environment campaigners say they believe the proposal will lead to an “endless stream” of new battles over river development. They criticised the government, who they said rushed it through without proper public consultation or environmental impact assessments.Norwegian firm lobbying to open Rosebank oilfield halves green investmentsRead moreTruls Gulowsen, head of the Norwegian Society for theConservationof Nature, said: “We will fight for every single protected watercourse, for every river, every waterfall and every lake. We will not give up what we have won through more than a hundred years of watercourse struggle because of an ill-considered and irresponsible hasty decision.”Norway, a Nordic country known for its dramatic fjords and pristine nature, has protected nearly 400 waterways with plans that keep them from being dammed by large power plants. Its rivers and the species in them have separately comeunder threatfrom intensive farming and the climate crisis.Campaigners protested outside the Norwegian parliament on Tuesday and presented a petition opposing hydropower development in protected waterways that they said gathered 25,000 signatures.Supporters of the proposal claim critics have “hyped up” the dangers to nature. The criteria for approval remains unchanged and companies seeking to build hydropower dams would still face strict assessments before being granted a permit.The proposal was voted through on Thursday by the Conservative party, the Progress party, the Labour party and the Centre party. The Christian Democrats withdrew their support, citing uncertainty over the wording.Pål Mugaas, a spokesperson for Norske Lakseelver (Norwegian Salmon Rivers), said: “It’s a sad day for the wild salmon and all the other species in what was supposed to be permanently protected rivers.”Disputes over renewable energy have rocked Norwegian politics in recent months. The government collapsed at the end of January in a row over adopting the EU’s latest clean energy package.The Norwegian electricity grid is among the cleanest on the planet – a result of its hydropower dams – and the country is a net power exporter that has long enjoyed cheap bills.Merethe Dotterud Leiren, a political scientist at the Cicero Centre for International Climate Research, said: “This situation makes it politically harder to defend investments in renewables.”Norway’s clean energy conflicts have so far centred on wind turbines. The refusal to dismantle a wind farm that was found to have violated the rights of indigenous Sámi reindeer herders in 2021 has attracted the support of climate campaigners around the world, including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.Leiren said: “In general, Norwegians are more positive to hydropower than windpower. However, there are basically no places left to build large hydroelectric power plants without building in protected nature.”Fornybar Norge, the Norwegian renewable energy lobby group, said in a statement last week that it supported the proposal to loosen river protections.It said: “This will, among other things, be relevant for projects that have a significant flood-reducing effect. At the same time, it is good that the decision is not a free pass for the construction of new facilities in protected watercourses.”The Norwegian Water Resources andEnergyDirectorate (NVE) has previously said there is little power to be gained from exploiting rivers without significant interventions into nature.Kjetil Lund, the NVE director, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK on Tuesday: “There is barely any great potential for development in protected waterways, unless you want to exploit the most beautiful, most valuable nature we have.”Explore more on these topicsNorwayHydropowerEnergyEuropeRenewable energyConservationFishnewsShareReuse this content"

After their meeting, Sharif said the two countries were in “complete agreement” on establishing a Russian base “and there are no obstacles”.The Red Sea is one of the world’s most strategically important waterways, connecting the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean. About 12% of global trade passes through it.Sudan first floated the idea of allowing Russia to have a naval facility on its coast in 2017 during a trip to Sochi by Omar al-Bashir, the then president, who was ousted in a 2019 coup. A deal was eventually signed in 2020 that reportedly permitted Russia to keep up to four navy ships, including nuclear-powered ones, inSudanfor a period of 25 years.At the time, a draft agreementsaidthe bases were for logistical purposes and were “defensive and not aimed against other countries”.After the meeting with Lavrov, Sharif said a new deal was not required as “there was a deal signed [in 2020] and there is no disagreement”, adding that it only had to be ratified by both sides.Sudan’s military and civilian leaders dragged their feet on moving ahead with the deal due to lingering differences over its terms. The civil war that started in April 2023 between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces further complicated relations between Russia and Sudan, as the Russian-backed Wagner group threw its weight behind the RSF while the Kremlin appeared to back the Sudanese army.“Russia was playing both sides,” said Samuel Ramani, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank and the author of a book on Moscow’s engagements with Africa. Since thedeathof Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner mercenary group’s leader, the Kremlin had “incrementally” deepened ties with the Sudanese army, Ramani added.Last April, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Mikhail Bogdanov, visited Sudan and pledged “uncapped” support for its army. Russia has also backed Sudan at the UN security council, where it vetoed a resolution calling for a ceasefire for humanitarian reasons, a move the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy,calleda disgrace.3:08‘Shame on Putin’: David Lammy condemns Russia’s UN veto on Sudan ceasefire resolution – videoSudan’s army has won a string of battles against the RSF in recent months and isincreasingly confidentof a decisive victory over the paramilitary group, whose leaders the US has accused of genocide. In January the US imposed sanctions on Sudan’s army leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, for “choosing war over good-faith negotiation”.Aid organisations have said Sudan is the scene of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with the largest internally displaced population and fears thatfaminehas broken out in parts of the country.The announcement comes weeks after Moscow’s ally in the Middle East, Bashar al-Assad, was overthrown in an armed rebellion in Syria, casting doubt on the future of Russia’s Tartus naval base in the eastern Mediterranean.Explore more on these topicsRussiaSudanAfricaEuropeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But an appeals court on Thursday overturned “the contested judgment in its entirety”. The judge, Rafal Kaniok, cited doubts over the impartiality of the presiding judge who delivered the sentence in 2023.Supporters of Wydrzyńska – including from herAbortionDream Team nonprofit organisation, which helps women carry out abortions – gathered in the court.“For me, this is not a victory,” Wydrzyńska told AFP after the ruling. “The only outcome I would consider a victory today would have been if this court had said: ‘Yes, you are innocent.’”The price of choice – the fight over abortion in Poland | photo essayRead moreA handful of anti-abortion activists were also present outside the building, reciting Catholic prayers.Currently, women can get an abortion in hospital only if the pregnancy results from sexual assault or incest or poses a direct threat to the life or health of the mother. Abortion assistance is punishable by up to three years in jail.A network of abortion rights groups, Abortion Without Borders, said that it dealt with an “overwhelming number of inquiries from people seeking abortion support” inPolandor abroad. In 2024, the network “supported 47,000 people in accessing abortion care”, it said in a report released last month.“Abortion in Poland is a daily reality,” it added, estimating that up to 150,000 abortions were carried out each year in the predominantly Catholic country.But according to official numbers, only about 780 of those were performed in Polish hospitals in the first 10 months of 2024.In August, the prime minister conceded there was “simply no majority” to deliver on his party’s pledge to allow abortion until the 12th week of pregnancy in the current parliamentary term. One of his senior lawmakers announced last month that work on relaxing the rules, some of Europe’s strictest, would resume only after the presidential election scheduled for May.Four bills to loosen the abortion law had been debated in a parliamentary committee, but even if they got the green light from lawmakers, Poland’s conservative president, Andrzej Duda, has indicated he will veto them.Explore more on these topicsPolandDonald TuskAbortionWomenHealthEuropeReproductive rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Those where more than 50% of residents are from a “non-western” backgrounds are labelled a “parallel society”, formerly referred to as a “ghetto”.If, in addition to unfavourable socioeconomic conditions, a neighbourhood has also had an immigrant population of more than 50% for the last five years, it is labelled a “transformation area”, formerly known as a “hard ghetto”.This requires the public housing association to propose a plan to cut social housing by 40% – including by selling properties, demolition or conversion and terminating the lease of the former tenants – by 2030.The European court of justice (ECJ) said in a statement on Thursday that Tamara Ćapeta, an advocate general, had found in a non-binding legal opinion that “the division between ‘western’ and ‘non-western’ immigrants and their descendants is based on ethnic origin.”How Denmark’s ‘ghetto list’ is ripping apart migrant communitiesRead moreThe statement added: “She considers that, although ‘non-westerners’ are an ethnically diverse group, what unites that group is not a commonality of factors that form ‘ethnicity’ within that group, but rather the perception by the Danish legislature that this group does not possess the characteristics of the other group, the ‘westerners’.”The ECJ follows the advice of its advocates general most of the time.Although tenants whose leases were terminated were not selected on the basis of their non-western origin, “they nevertheless suffer direct discrimination on the basis of the ethnic criterion,” Ćapeta found, according to the statement.She said the legislation put tenants in a vulnerable position in terms of housing that led to worse treatment than those in neighbourhoods where the majority of the population was of “western” origin.“The ethnic criterion used by Danish legislation stigmatises the ethnic group whose structural disadvantage in their ability to integrate into Danish society was recognised, thus curtailing rather than enhancing their chances to integrate into that society,” the statement said.The case was referred to the ECJ by Denmark’s eastern high court after tenants on the Mjølnerparken estate in Copenhagen and Schackenborgvænge estate in Slagelse challenged the legality of development plans based on Danish social housing law.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If the court reaches the same conclusion as the advocate general, the Parallel Societies Act could be in violation of EU law,” she said.“In that case, the state must correct the situation to ensure that citizens are not discriminated against and amend the law to comply with EU regulations. This case is both important and a matter of principle, as it could have implications for everyone who has been subjected to the same treatment.”The “parallel societies” law, formerly known as the ghetto law, came into force in July 2018, but Denmark has had regulations targeting so-called “ghetto areas” since 2010.The Danish minister of social affairs and housing, Sophie Hæstorp Andersen, said she had noted the advocate general’s proposal, but would not take action until the ECJ made a final decision, which is expected in the spring.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkCourt of justice of the European UnionEuropean UnionEuropeMigrationRacenewsShareReuse this content"

It was made publicon 7 Februaryas part of the ongoing investigation into the implosion and OceanGate, the company that developed the Titan.0:20Recording captures suspected sound of Titan submersible's implosion – audioOn 18 June 2023, the Titan submersible was on a tourist expedition to explore the wreck of the Titanic, the “unsinkable” British luxury passenger liner that sank on its maiden voyage from England to New York, resting in deep, frigid waters south-east of Newfoundland, Canada, after hitting an iceberg in April 1912. The catastrophe killed around 1,500 passengers and crew and spared around 700 of those onboard.The Titan was descending towards the wreck when it experienced a “catastrophic implosion” several hundred miles south-east of Newfoundland. The implosion was caused by a sudden inward collapse due to the intense ocean pressure on the cylindrical craft, investigators said.A dramatic search and rescue mission was launched and after several days, the US Coast Guard confirmed that all five passengers onboard were killed in the incident.Presumed human remains, believed to be the victims’, and wreckage were recovered.Those killedwereStockton Rush, the OceanGate CEO; Hamish Harding, a British explorer; Shahzada Dawood, a British businessman, and his 19-year-old son Suleman; and Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French diver and renowned Titanic expert who had made previous dives to the wreck.The coastguard and the US National Transportation Safety Board held around two weeks of hearings into the implosion, in which multipleformer employeesandexpertstestified.During the hearings, it was revealed that one of the last messages from the crew of the submersible was“all good here”.Ex-OceanGate employee calls Titan disaster ‘inevitable’ as first video shownRead moreAdditionally, the former operations director of OceanGatetestifiedthat he believed that such a tragedy was “inevitable” due to the disregard for safety standards in the design and use of the submersible.The coastguard alsoreleased the first imagesand videos of the remains of the submersible. They showed the Titan’s broken tail cone and fragments of the vessel scattered on the ocean floor.OceanGate has come under intense scrutiny. It was revealed that in 2018 industry leaders in the submersible vessel field warned Rush ofpossible “catastrophic” problems related to the Titan’s development.A lawsuit has also beenfiledby a family member of one of the victims, accusing OceanGate and its CEO of negligence.Explore more on these topicsTitanic sub incidentThe TitanicnewsShareReuse this content"

This technology is fast enough for them to adopt that they could misuse it and do real harm.”In reference to the head of the al-Qaida terrorist group who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks in 2001, he said: “I’m always worried about the Osama bin Laden scenario, where you have some truly evil person who takes over some aspect of our modern life and uses it to harm innocent people.”Schmidt agreed with the US export controls introduced by the former US president Joe Biden, which restricted the sale of the microchips that power the most advanced AI system to 18 countries to slow adversaries’ progress on AI research.He urged government oversight on private tech companies that are developing AI models, but added that over-regulation could stifle innovation. “It’s really important that governments understand what we’re doing and keep their eye on us,” he said.“My experience with the tech leaders is that they do have an understanding of the impact they’re having, but they might make a different values judgment than the government would make.”Google owner drops promise not to use AI for weaponsRead moreSchmidt was speaking from Paris, where the two-day AI Action summit finished on Tuesday with theUS and UK refusing to sign an agreementon “inclusive” AI.The declaration was signed by 57 countries, including India and China, the EU and the African Union.The UK declined to back the joint communique because it failed to provide enough “practical clarity” or address “harder questions” about national safety.The US vice-president, JD Vance, has said that regulation would “kill a transformative industry just as it’s taking off”.Schmidt said Europe’s more restricted approach meant “that the AI revolution, which is the most important revolution in my opinion since electricity, is not going to be invented in Europe”.Separately, Schmidt, who was head of Google when the company bought Android, which now makes the most-used mobile phone operating system in the world, said he supported initiatives to keep phones out of schools.“The situation with children is particularly disturbing to me,” he said. “I think smartphones with a kid can be safe, they just need to be moderated … we can all agree that children should be protected from the bad of the online world.”Schmidt has also supported proposals for a ban on social media for children under 16. He said: “Why would we run such a large, uncontrolled experiment on the most important people in the world, which is the next generation?”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Eric SchmidtGoogleShareReuse this content"

X-Ray Eyes (2024)The most recentLCD Soundsystemsingle sounded remarkably like a callback to their earliest releases: a minimal backing of rhythm track and synth – playing a riff that recalls their debut single, Losing My Edge – plus a spoken-word vocal that’s alternately creepily stalker-ish and drily funny.19. Movement (2005)The Fall were clearly a major influence on LCD, but never more so than on James Murphy’s scathing, Mark-E-Smith-esque assault on what an excitable 00s music press called the “New Rock Revolution”, complete with a lyrical quote from Telephone Thing (“I’m tapped!”). Suicide-style electronics and raging guitar complete the picture.18. Get Innocuous! (2007)As Murphy has often pointed out, he never intended to have a career as an artist, just as a producer. Get Innocuous! wrestles with the reality of unexpected success to a mesmerising accompaniment, with the vocalist Nancy Whang in the role of cheerleader: “You can normalise – don’t it make you feel alive?”17. Call the Police (2017)Seven minutes of relentless, hypnotic new-wave-inspired pounding, Robert-Fripp-ish guitar – and an inexplicably satisfying tick-tocking vintage drum machine sound – buoys a horrified response to the rise of Donald Trump. The lyrics featuring an all-too-familiar cast of frightened old guys, “trigger kids and fakers and some questionable views”.16. You Wanted a Hit (2010)View image in fullscreenMesmerising … Nancy Whang and LCD Soundsystem.Photograph: Leandro Justen/BFA/ShutterstockAmong the reasons LCD broke up was record company pressure to repeat their past successes, as addressed by You Wanted a Hit: “Leave us on our own … we won’t be your babies any more.” Fittingly, the sound would be commercial were it not disrupted by slashing guitar and jarringly electronic effects; the Soulwax remix, meanwhile, streamlines it perfectly for the dancefloor.15. Never as Tired as When I’m Waking Up (2005)A lot of LCD’s eponymous debut album is concerned with the night before, but this feels very much like the morning (or afternoon) after. It suddenly lurches into life, tender but fuzzy-headed, with a melody that carries a faint hint of the Beatles circa the White Album. The result is beautiful: an underrated gem.14. How Do You Sleep? (2017)No reference point in LCD’s music is ever accidental – Murphy is an unabashed music nerd – including pilfering the title of John Lennon’s notorious attack on Paul McCartney. Amid booming drums, swirling synths and explosions of raw analogue bleeping, Murphy sounds genuinely anguished at the collapse of the friendship at the heart of DFA Records.13. Yeah (Crass Version) (2004)By Murphy’s account, Yeah had a difficult, lengthy gestation. His frustration seeped into the lyrics (“I’m getting tired of listening, knowing that this shit’s gotta run”), but the end result was worth it: seething, chaotic punk-funk that gradually shifts its sound from disco to squealing acid house, as if providing a potted history of dance music.12. Oh Baby (2017)If you were going to announce you were back, six years after a grand farewell gig at Madison Square Garden, the opening track of American Dream was a hugely appealing way to do it: Suicide’s Dream Baby Dream recast as dubby, Balearic pop, the blissed-out mood at odds with Murphy’s pleading vocal.View image in fullscreenUnabashed music nerd … James Murphy.Photograph: Xavi Torrent/WireImage11. All I Want (2010)You could easily dismiss All I Want as record-collection rock: it’s equal parts David Bowie’s Heroes and Brian Eno’s Here Come the Warm Jets. But if bemoaning clear reference points is your thing, LCD probably aren’t the band for you. And besides: who cares when the results are exceptional?10. Dance Yrself Clean (2010)It’s all about the moment, three minutes in, when what initially appears to be a subdued, sparse electronic lament explodes. The whole thing gets louder, as if you have suddenly cranked the volume control, an idea so simple and thrilling you wonder why more people don’t do it.9. Home (2010)The final track on what was supposed to be LCD’s final album is a lovely thing, with warm electronic arpeggios and electric piano, clip-clopping percussion and a lyric that seems to plot their progress from unlikely solo project to the camaraderie of a band: “You’re surrounded, it won’t get any better, and so – goodnight.”8. New York, I Love You But You’re Bringing Me Down (2007)The anti Empire State of Mind. A song that sounds, unexpectedly, like a lost 40s standard, it laments the passing of the city’s scuzzier and more exciting days – “you’re safer and you’re wasting my time” – yet sounds begrudgingly enthralled despite the gentrification: “You’re still the one pool where I’d happily drown.”7. Tonite (2017)Murphy’s lyrics can occasionally approach music journalism, as on this funny, incisive examination of 21st-century pop’s penchant for carpe diem messaging. Is it actually expressing a fear of ageing, death or the future? Its cleverness wouldn’t matter without a killer tune, which Tonite has, along with a filthy, squelchy synth riff.6. Someone Great (2007)This is LCD’s take on the cocktail of euphoria and melancholy at the heart of a lot of great disco and house music. The rhythm is propulsive, the glockenspiel-assisted melody is bright, but the mood is suffused with sighing sadness and the lyrics contemplate grief. A punch is duly packed.5. North American Scum (2007)A marvellously conflicted examination of the US (less fun than Berlin, apparently) and foreign perceptions of its inhabitants (“I know you wouldn’t touch us with a 10ft pole”), with a hint of Talking Heads in its lyrical and musical DNA. Its brand of funk is agitated, its bassline is a monster.View image in fullscreenMurphy and Pat Mahoney performing at Glastonbury festival in 2024.Photograph: Joe Maher/Getty Images4. I Can Change (2010)A homage to early 80s synth pop – you would be forgiven for thinking you were listening to Yazoo when the intro kicks in – but rather than focus on that sound’s neon hues, I Can Change digs deep into its yearning, lovelorn quality. For all the promise in the title, you suspect the troubled relationship isn’t going to work out.3. Losing My Edge (2002)Allegedly inspired by a meeting with a young Pharrell Williams and made on a toy synthesiser attached to an ancient beatbox, LCD’s fantastic debut single was satire of and a love letter to hip record-collector snobbery, packed with snarky wit and riven with an affecting insecurity. It’s also funky as hell.2. Daft Punk Is Playing at My House (2005)A fantasy of the French house duo performing at a house party like a local punk band, you could read this track as an analogy for Murphy’s MDMA-fuelled transformation from uptight punk to dance fanatic. Either way, it’s punchy, writhing and as improbably exciting as the scenario it describes.1. All My Friends (2007)When LCD Soundsystem appeared with Losing My Edge – smart, sarky, thoroughly meta – the last thing you would have expected them to make was a moving paean to lasting friendship and time passing. But that’s what All My Friends is. It might have been inspired by the loneliness of touring, but anyone can see themselves reflected in its desire to reconnect and peel back the years. The message is: don’t worry about tomorrow; come and party tonight. As the music shifts slowly from melancholy to euphoria – underpinned by a piano line that owes something to the Velvet Underground’s I’m Waiting for the Man – it’s a very tough invitation to refuse.Explore more on these topicsRankedLCD SoundsystemPop and rockDance musicElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Who were you most star-struck by?McScootikinsHarrison Ford! I was star-struck when Harrison Ford came to visit because I’d made Indy [Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]. Spielberg played a big joke on him. There was a biography out of him that he really hated, so Steven went out and bought about 300 copies, so that when Harrison came to visit and walked on to set, the security guard, the gaffers, the camera equipment people,everybodywas reading that biography.I remember when we were told that Michael Jackson was going to visit. The cast and crew were so excited. We didn’t know what time he was arriving, so we were constantly looking over our shoulder. Sure enough, when he walked on to the set, everybody just stopped what they were doing – even the guy making the coffee. He was very shy. I think we made him nervous because there were so many people. Then we took those photos that you see on the internet. We were so giddy that he was there. He gave us tickets to watch him perform in Los Angeles, and gave us all a jacket, which some of us still have. Somehow I lost mine, which I’m very mad at myself for.How do you believe your childhood inHo Chi Minh City, and your subsequent flight from Vietnam, affected your career in film?FedUpWithEverything2View image in fullscreenGoonies never say die! … Quan, centre, in The Goonies.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarFirst, it gave me a global perspective. Second, it gave me this huge sense of gratitude; this appreciation that I get to do what I love. I feel so lucky to be an actor and to be able to make movies that entertain people all over the world. My first movie was Temple of Doom, which was so beloved. I followed that with The Goonies – again another iconic movie. I feel so lucky to be a part of those and to have so many fans come up to me on the street and say how growing up watching those movies had a huge impact on their life.You were arguably typecast in the early stages of your career, as wereother actors of Asian heritage. Will Hollywood ever properly embrace colour-blind casting?MoreorLesPaulWhen I started my career, it was a very different time. My latest movie, Love Hurts, is a big-budget movie with an Asian lead. That alone is a testament to how much everything has changed and to Hollywood’s willingness to tell diverse stories. I’m very optimistic. When I read for Love Hurts, there was no description for my character. Open casting is something I applaud Hollywood for. Ouroboros in Loki was another incredible character I played that had no specific ethnicity, but Marvel thought I’d be good for it. So things are looking really good.What goes through your mind when you stand up to receive an Oscar?richpelleyView image in fullscreen‘It was the one of the greatest feelings I’ve ever had in my life’ … Quan with his Oscar for best supporting actor in Everything Everywhere All at Once.Photograph: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagicWhen my name was read out, I was so overwhelmed with emotion, my mind was a blur. I couldn’t believe it was happening. I had a dream for 40 years and when I was handed that Oscar, that dream became a reality. It was the one of the greatest feelings I’ve ever had in my life and something I wish everyone would get to experience. Not necessarily win an Oscar, but whatever your Oscar moment is, I wish everybody could feel that. It was incredible.What does your wife make of your return to the spotlight?EveningEdition25For years, even when I didn’t believe in myself, she said: “Trust me.” So now I think she would like to say: “I told you!” She really believed in me, so I’m glad I didn’t disappoint her. The best part is seeing how happy she is for me. She has really made this entire journey even more special.Youalways looks so dapper on the red carpet. What’s your secret?hittheroadjackI have a lot of help. My wife has great taste, as does my stylist, Chloe. When I was nominated for an Oscar, Giorgio Armani reached out and said: ‘We would love to make you a tux.’ I was like: ‘What?’ I remember going into the Armani store, getting measured, and a month later, going back to try it on. I realised: this is what a made-to-order tux looks like. I love it. I wish I could take credit, but really the credit belongs to the people who help me look good.View image in fullscreenTestament to how much everything has changed’ … Quan as Marvin Gable in Love Hurts.Photograph: Allen Fraser/Universal PicturesDid you really promise your mum that you wouldn’t swear when filming The Goonies?TopTrampFuck, yeah! It’s true. But not any more! I did say: “S-H-I-T,” but you’ve got to give me some credit. At least I can spell!In retrospect, should you have contained your excitement a bitwhen you introduced Joe Biden [at an event]?MrSOBaldrickAbsolutely not! He was the president of the United States. I thought I was going to be cool and say the line: “Ladies and Gentlemen, here is the president of the United States.” That is one sentence that I never thought I would get to say. But by the time it got to it, I was jumping up and down with excitement. I don’t think I would’ve done it any other way.Love Hurts review – Everything Everywhere all over againRead moreWhat type of movies would you like to make more of?RedAmazonaOh my gosh. There’s a long list of movies I want to make and film-makers I want to work with. I grew up in the 80s watching big commercial movies such as the Back to the Future trilogy and Jaws, all those incredible, fun, really cool movies that had an impact on people’s lives. I would love to be a part of more of those movies. I’d love to play a bad guy. I got a little taste of that when playing Marvin Gable [in Love Hurts]. It’s a lot of fun to be a bad guy. It takes me out of my comfort zone. How often do I get asked about Goonies 2? That is the question I’ve been asked the most over the last four decades – which is incredible. Any other of the Goonies – Sean, Josh or Jeff – will tell you the same thing, which is incredible. Aren’t I a bit old to be a Goonie? No!

Stacked with Trump loyalists, the new board terminated the center’s president, Deborah Rutter, and installed Trump as chair. The board then named Richard Grenell, who served as ambassador to Germany during the firstTrump administration, as interim president.In response, several stars have disassociated from the center.Issa Rae, creator and star of Insecure, announced on her Instagram story on Thursday that she was cancelling her upcoming one-night-only show at the Kennedy Center. The sold-out show, An Evening with Issa Rae, was scheduled at the venue in March.“Unfortunately, due to what I believe to be an infringement on the values of an institution that has faithfully celebrated artists of all backgrounds through all mediums, I’ve decided to cancel my appearance at this venue,” Rae wrote.Kennedy Center board votes to elect Trump as new chairRead moreOn Wednesday, the renowned soprano Reneé Fleming said she would step down from her role as artistic adviser to the center. Though her statement did not mention Trump, she praised its ousted chair David M Rubenstein and Rutter, and said: “Out of respect, I think it right to depart as well.“I’ve treasured the bipartisan support for this institution as a beacon of America at our best,” she said. “I hope the Kennedy Center continues to flourish and serve the passionate and diverse audience in our nation’s capital and across the country.”The creator of Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy,Shonda Rhimes, alsoresignedfrom her position as treasurer while the singer-songwriter Ben Folds revealed that he would also be stepping down as artistic adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra.“Given developments at the Kennedy Center, effective today I am resigning as artistic advisor to the NSO,” hewrotein an Instagram statement. “Not for me.”When Trump wasasked by presslast week why he wanted to be chair he said it was because they didn’t need “woke” at the Kennedy Center. “Some of the shows were terrible, they were a disgrace,” he said.

She doesn’t reveal her real name – the space where it should be on her Instagram bio is instead filled by the word “NO” – nor her age: she once told the Guardian she was “20,000” years old. She first attracted attention with a SoundCloud page, filled with snippets of music she had given shrugging, prosaic titles: A Child Was Sad So I Made This in Front of Her to Make Her Laugh; Sounds From Friday Evening. Said snippets have long been deleted, but a fragmentary, demo-like quality has clung to her releases ever since: the 12 short tracks on her 2022 mixtape Shiloh: Lost for Words played out in a mass of muffled synth tones and distorted samples.View image in fullscreenArtwork for John Glacier’s Like A Ribbon.Photograph: Publicity imageMore than one critic has compared the effect of her vocal style – occasional bursts of brisk lyricism separated by sections in which she incants the same phrases over and over, as if in a stoned daze – to overhearing someone’s scattered voice memos. On Like a Ribbon, even her most pugilistic lines – “I’m the hottest in the game”; “I don’t give a fuck, let the people talk”; “now they’re calling me a bitch – best believe it” – are delivered in an oddly blank tone, as if she’s muttering them to herself, unaware that anyone’s listening. Elsewhere, her lyrics have a stream-of consciousness effect, a splurge of words written to try to work out how she feels – or perhaps just because she likes the way they sound together: “Like a satellite in the dark / In the night / Whereabouts in the clouds like a kite / Floating in the winds let the birds float by,” runs a characteristic line on opener Satellites.The album’s sound, meanwhile, ranges in style from booming electronics to shaky, lo-fi piano samples – the latter on the Sampha-featuring Ocean Steppin’ – but its cornerstone sound is an electric guitar, artlessly played, as if picking through the pattern that opens the album or the vaguely Pixies-like riff on Money Shows for the first time. It’s the kind of idiosyncratic approach around which cult followings are built, and one is duly building around Glacier: she’s now signed to Young, home of the xx and FKA twigs; a succession of fashion designers have called upon her services as a model. You can see why: Like a Ribbon is entirely enthralling.John Glacier: Ocean Steppin’ ft Sampha – videoIts 30 minutes are so packed with ideas, it’s quite hard to take in on one listen, and so rewards repeat plays. There are big, nagging earworms: the echoing, glacial riff that runs through Emotions is hugely addictive, so is Nevasure’s beautiful synth pattern. The beats boast the influence not just of hip-hop, but UK garage, grime and drum’n’bass, and invariably wrap around the rest of the music in unexpected ways, their accents never landing where you automatically assume they will. They’re part of a teeming mass of mysterious sounds: the glitching, incomprehensible voices that interrupt Satellites; the murky pool of slowed-down samples beneath Steady As I Am; the solitary distressing scream that suddenly appears out of nowhere towards the end of Don’t Cover Me. Heaven’s Sent ends the album with a recording of a perplexing phone conversation over a fragile acoustic guitar figure. As a conclusion it feels both enigmatic and premature, meaning your immediate reaction is to play the whole thing again.John Glacier: the Hackney rapper mingling catharsis and mysteryRead moreIn the middle of Nevasure – a song that, like a lot of the album, deals with feelings of uncertainty – Glacier opens a verse with the words “Since I came to Earth …” It fits: the contents of Like a Ribbon seem pretty alien to anything else that’s currently happening in UK rap. If you were looking elsewhere for context, abstract US hip-hop collective Surf Gang appear on Dancing in the Rain; you could also file it somewhere in the region of Mica Levi or the weirder moments on Earl Sweatshirt’s Sick! But ultimately, Like a Ribbon really doesn’t sound much like anything else. As with her lyrics and their offhand delivery, it’s all genuinely intriguing: you could spend an awful lot of time trying to unpick what’s happening here and never really get to the bottom of it. But reaching conclusions doesn’t really matter: it’s clearly an album about the journey rather than the destination. John Glacier has constructed her own peculiar, alluring world: getting lost in it is a completely fascinating and engrossing experience.This week Alexis listened toDivorce – AntarcticaThe opening track from Divorce’s forthcoming debut album: a pattering drum machine rhythm track, wobbly lo-fi guitar, beautiful vocal harmonies, a lovely song.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekRapExperimental musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

There are notable exceptions of course, most recentlyDaniel Barenboim’s version with the Berlin Staatskapelle, there’s even a version conducted by Yevgeny Svetlanov with the USSR Symphony Orchestra and British singers, while two of John Barbirolli’s three recordings were made with the New York Philharmonic and the Orchestra of RAI in Rome. But here we have a British conductor,Nicholas Collon, recording Gerontius with a Finnish orchestra and a mixed chorus of Finnish and British singers, in a performance taken from a concert in Helsinki last April.View image in fullscreenElgar: The Dream of Gerontius album art.Photograph: OndineIt’s a very distinguished addition to the pantheon of Gerontius recordings, conducted by Collon with acute sensitivity to the tiniest nuances in Elgar’s score. Timings may suggest that overall it is one of the faster versions on record, but nothing about it feels rushed or overpressed; both the solo sections and the great choral set pieces have just the right spaciousness, and all the necessary dramatic bite when required in sections like the Demons chorus, while the exchanges between Gerontius and the Angel in the second part of the oratorio are never made too overtly operatic nor too piously formal.The impressive Gerontius is the young Scottish tenorJohn Findon, with the right heroic edge to his tone in his moments of extremity but a softer, more lyrical core in moments of reflection. Both the mezzo and baritone parts are taken by singers who have regularly sung the work in concert but never recorded it before. Christine Rice is a fabulously sympathetic Angel and, praise indeed, as good as any on disc since Janet Baker, whileRoderick Williamsmay lack the ideal weight and darkness of tone for the Priest and the Angel of the Agony, but more than compensates for that in the way in which typically he shapes and point every phrase so purposefully; his contribution is as thoughtful as every other element in Collon’s performance.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

The tiredness etched on their faces is not from late nights partying or long days networking. It looks more like the weight of the world on their shoulders.Anya Stasenko and Slava Leontyev are ceramics artists from the frontline Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. They have been married for decades and work together, making beautifully intricate painted porcelain beasts no bigger than your fist. When Russian troops invaded in 2022, rather than fleeing, the couple stayed in Kharkiv. Leontyev was a weapons instructor in the Ukrainian special forces, a weapons instructor who trained civilian volunteers. Then he picked up a camera and shot a documentary,Porcelain War. When the film premiered at Sundance in January 2024, the couple flew to the US, expecting to stay for a month.View image in fullscreenThe artists at work in their studio.Photograph: Picturehouse 2024Then, to everyone’s surprise, Porcelain War won the festival’s top documentary prize. The couple have spent the past year in the US raising awareness forUkraine. “We never planned to be here such a long time and we really need to get back as soon possible,” says Leontyev. They are based in Denver, but spend most of their time travelling with the film.Do they ever feel a sense of guilt about being away from Ukraine so long? Leontyev shakes his head. “I never felt guilty, but I really miss people.” He talks about his unease when he started making the documentary while still serving. “When I picked up my camera, someone had to pick up a rifle in my place, literally. I cannot explain. I felt … not guilty, but something was wrong.”View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian soldier with one of the artists’ creations.Photograph: ©Picturehouse 2024One day, Leontyev asked his unit commander for her honest opinion. “She said to me: ‘Your camera is a powerful weapon. More impactful than a rifle.’ It was only possible to make this movie because my unit completely supported us.” So far, the unit has had no fatalities. “It is a miracle,” he says.We are talking without an interpreter. Last January, Stasenko and Leontyev arrived in the US unable to speak English. In a year, they have gone from zero to conversational. Leontyev is apologetic. “Our English is not so perfect,” he grins. “The grammar is absent!”At this point, a little scrap of fur pokes its head up from his wife’s lap. It’s Frodo, the couple’s terrier, another star of the film. Frodo is barking at an aeroplane. “He thinks every aeroplane is a military aeroplane. He chases them away,” says Leontyev, looking at his wife. They smile at each other.Watch a trailer for the film.Stasenko and Leontyev have known each other since childhood. There is a photograph in Porcelain War of Stasenko pushing her future husband down the street in an old-fashioned pram (she is a few years older than him). They got together at art school in the 1980s in what was still Soviet Ukraine. In 1991, they were students when the Soviet Union collapsed. “It was interesting – and a hungry time,” says Leontyev.“It’s normal for students to be hungry!” his wife points out. She wonders whether living through that moment prepared them for the war. “It was a beautiful time. It did not look like the war. But our generation, we have this experience of broken rules all around. We understand that all around may fly away in a moment.”Oscars nominations 2025: the full listRead moreThey eventually settled in Crimea, close to their friend Andrey Stefanov, a painter who is the cinematographer on Porcelain War. Then, in 2014, Russia invaded Crimea and they returned to Kharkiv. At this point, Leontyev started military training. “Weknew,” he says. “Since the annexation of Crimea, weknewwhat kind of war would come to us.”The couple fill their film with the beauty of Ukraine’s landscape. We also watch Stasenko paint – an act of resistance in the face of an aggressor aiming to obliterate a nation’s identity. In his voiceover, Leontyev compares porcelain to Ukraine: “Easy to break, impossible to destroy.”Porcelain War review – beautifully rendered portrait of Ukraine’s artist-warriorsRead morePorcelain War takes us tothe Bakhmut frontlinein footage shot by the civilian soldiers in Leontyev’s unit, using bodycams and drones shipped from the US with medical supplies by a Ukrainian hairdresser in New Jersey. The drones track bombs falling on Russian targets. They are operated by people who once had regular jobs, but now look death in the face every day. There is an IT analyst, a furniture salesman, a dairy farmer. Watching it, you can’t help but wonder: could I do that? Do I have what it takes?Leontyev says the message is about resistance – ordinary people defending democracy. It shows the best of Ukrainians, he says. “In dark times, kind people shine. All these people joined as volunteers. They are not only defending their families; they came because they felt responsibility in the face of history. This battle is between totalitarianism and democracy. It’s not the frontline between Ukraine and Russia. It’s the frontline of the whole world.”Porcelain War has been nominated for best documentary at the Oscars; the couple’s stay in the US has been prolonged once again. A win would make the world their audience, up there on stage to accept the award, wouldn’t it? They nod. But Leontyev is modest about the achievement. “I never thought we’d be nominated. I don’t feel like it’s mine. Behind the film is the bravery of every Ukrainian soldier and the resilience of every Ukrainian civilian. It’s the nomination of every Ukrainian.”Explore more on these topicsOscarsUkraineDocumentary filmsAwards and prizesSundance film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is generally no need to buy a fresh phone just because new models have been released, as hardware updates are broadly iterative, adding small bits to an already accomplished package. But if you do want a replacement handset, whether new or refurbished, here are the best devices of the current crop of Apple smartphones.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Many other smartphones are available besides the iPhone, but if you’re an Apple user and don’t fancyswitching to Android, you still have a couple of choices. Whether your priority is the longest battery life, the best camera, the biggest screen or simply the optimal balance of features and price, there’s more to choose from in the Apple ecosystem than you may expect, especially after the iPhone 16 models were released in September 2024.At a glanceBest iPhone for most people:iPhone 16From £799 at AppleBest value iPhone:iPhone SEFrom £429 at AppleBest iPhone for camera:iPhone 16 ProFrom £999 at AppleBest iPhone for screen:iPhone 16 Pro MaxFrom £1,199 at AppleThe best iPhones you can buy in 2025The Apple iPhone 16 Plus with the iPhone 16.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianBest iPhone for most people:iPhone 16View image in fullscreenThe iPhone 16 includes some of the first Apple Intelligence AI features, such as writing, proofing and summarising tools.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe base model iPhone 16 has almost all the features that make Apple’s latest smartphones great, but it’s significantly cheaper than the 16 Pro models.It has Apple’s modern yet familiar aluminium and glass iPhone design and Face ID but has a rearranged camera cluster on the back. It sticks with the same 6.1in OLED screen as its predecessors, which looks good but lacks an always-on mode. It’s also still stuck at a relatively slow 60Hz refresh rate, which can make scrolling and motion more jarring than on models with faster screens.The latest A18 chip is rapid and enables Apple’s Intelligence features (AI tools). The battery lasts about two days of general use, or at least a day of heavy use, and the phone charges with USB-C. It also supports MagSafe and Qi/Qi2 wireless charging and accessories. It starts with a decent 128GB of storage, although larger models are available if you don’t want to store your photos and videos in the cloud.The iPhone 16 is light and fairly compact for a modern smartphone, and its IP68 rating means it’s water-resistant to depths of six metres for up to 30 minutes – more than safe enough for any accidental dunks. It gains the useful Action button from 2023’siPhone 15 Pro, which replaces the mute switch and can be used to mute the phone or for various other functions, such as turning on the torch or launching apps. The new Camera Control button is great for quickly opening the camera, even if zooming, changing settings and shooting photos with the button is fiddly in the camera app.The dual camera on the back is good, comprising a main 48MP camera and an improved 12MP ultrawide camera, which now has a macro photography mode for fun closeup shots. It also has Apple’s photographic styles features for those who want to customise how the camera captures photos (rich contrast, vibrant, warm) and get creative with tone and colour palette. The main camera can do a 2x in-sensor zoom, which works well in bright light, but the lack of a real telephoto camera holds the 16 back. The 12MP selfie camera is the same as other iPhones.The iPhone runs the recently released iOS 18.3, which includessupport for RCS messaging with Androidand adds more of Apple’s new AI features. They include a selection of AI writing tools that are built into the keyboard, which allow you to proof, rewrite and summarise text, create tables and lists, transcribe audio from calls and recordings, among other small features.An AI object remover in photos can help improve your shots, while theImage Playgroundtool can generate images for you from descriptions or photos, including cartoon versions of real people. The Genmoji tool in the keyboard can create custom emoji stickers too.Siri has a new design and can now pass queries to ChatGPT for more advanced answers. Apple’s notification summary tool has been tweaked too: it now summarises stacks of notifications with stylised italics and has paused summarising news and media notificationsafter a backlash.Apple’svisual intelligence featureallows users to point their camera at an object, text or information, such as URLs, calendar entries or phone numbers, to use them or find out more about them, including sending images to ChatGPT or Google for information.From £799 at AppleFrom £739 at John LewisWhy should you buy it?The iPhone 16 provides the standard iPhone experience at a cheaper price and in the most pocketable size, offering good battery life and access to new and future AI features.Buy if:you want the default, good iPhone experience todayDon’t buy if:you want optical zoom on your cameraRead ourfulliPhone 16 review: more buttons and speed for Apple’s standard phoneScreen:6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED)Processor:Apple A18Storage:128, 256 or 512GBCamera:48MP main + 12MP UW; 12MP front-facingDimensions:147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm (HWD)Weight:170gBattery and size upgrade:iPhone 16 PlusView image in fullscreenThough somewhat bulky to fit in a pocket, the iPhone 16 Plus has great battery life and a 6.7in screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The ObserverFor an extra £100, the iPhone 16 Plus matches the specs, camera and features of the base model but adds a bigger 6.7in screen and long battery life, which can last up to three days of general use. It still has the same pitfalls as the vanilla iPhone 16, such as a 60Hz display and no optical zoom camera, while its size makes it more difficult to use one-handed and somewhat bulky in a pocket.From £899 at Apple£849 at John LewisReadour fulliPhone 16 Plus review: Apple’s battery beastScreen:6.7in Super Retina XDR (OLED)Processor:Apple A18Storage:128, 256 or 512GBCamera:48MP main + 12MP UW; 12MP front-facingDimensions:160.9 x 77.8 x 7.8mm (HWD)Weight:199gBest value iPhone:iPhone SE (2022)View image in fullscreenA dated design hides more modern parts for a great-value option in the iPhone SE.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe iPhone SE is something of a throwback. It takes the classic pre-2017 design of the iPhone – complete with a Touch ID home button and chunky bezels – and puts a more modern chip at its heart.The third-generation iPhone SE was released in 2022 and is still the best-value new iPhone, with 5G and the A15 Bionic chip used in the2021 iPhone 13. The 4.7in screen is small and dim by modern standards, despite the phone feeling quite chunky. It lacks Face ID and other modern iPhone features, such as Apple Intelligence, and has only 64GB of storage at its base price. The single camera on the back is a bit weak, too.From £429 at Apple£479 at John LewisWhy should you buy it?The iPhone SE (2022) is the cheapest iPhone you can buy new.Buy if:you want the best-value iPhone, but don’t want to buy a refurbished modelDon’t buy if:you want a modern iPhone experience or high-quality cameraRead ourfullApple iPhone SE 2022 review: dated design but bargain priceScreen:4.7in Retina HD (LCD)Processor:Apple A15 BionicStorage:64, 128 or 256GBCamera:12MP rear; 7MP front-facingDimensions:138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3mm (HWD)Weight:144gBest iPhone for camera:iPhone 16 ProView image in fullscreenThe iPhone 16 Pro has a ‘crisp, bright and slick’ display.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe iPhone 16 Pro is Apple’s best phone. It’s the step-up option to the basic iPhone 16: the same good bits, but a slightly larger (6.3in) screen, despite being squeezed into a similarly sized titanium and glass body. The display is crisp, bright and slick, with a faster 120Hz refresh rate to keep scrolling and animations smooth. The screen also supports the handy always-on feature, showing the time and notifications when not in use.The 16 Pro also has a slightly more powerful A18 Pro chip and starts with 128GB of storage, with greater space available – up to 1TB – for those who need it. The battery lasts a good 40 hours of general use, meaning it will go through the heaviest of days, and most will need to charge it only every other day.It has the same two extra Action and Camera Control buttons as the regular model, but the camera on the back is better. The 48MP main camera and 48MP ultrawide camera are great and the extra 12MP 5x telephoto camera meaningfully closes the distances to objects. Combined, they shoot great photos across various lighting conditions and scenarios.From £999 at Apple£949 at John LewisWhy should you buy it?This is Apple’s best phone, with its most powerful camera, top performance and a high-quality big-enough screen in a device that’s still easy to fit in a pocket.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It takes everything great from the smaller iPhone 16 Pro and adds a bright, crisp and smooth 6.9in display. Watching movies on it feels more like using a small tablet than a phone.The 16 Pro Max also has a big battery, lasting about 55 hours of general use between charges, so it needs charging every third day. That means it will manage even the heaviest all-day use, and is ideal if you want to game for hours.However, Apple’s superphone is so big that it is hard to handle, needing two hands to wield.

If it’s past its best, a replacement costs£65 to £109 from Apple, or cheaper through third parties, and will give your iPhone a new lease of life. To speed things up, check you have enough free storage and clear out any unused apps or content, off-loading photos and videos to the cloud and deleting music. Aim for at least 2GB of free space.If your phone is worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. The latest software, version iOS 18, supports devices back to 2018’siPhone XS/XR, so anything older should be replaced soon – though some older models may still receiveoccasional security updatesfrom Apple.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished phonesis better for the planet and your wallet. The iPhone makes for an excellent refurbished phone, typically staying responsive for years and being supported with software updates for about seven years from release, or longer in some circumstances. That means you can use an older model for several years before it will need replacing.There are broadly two types of refurbished iPhone available: those refurbished andsold directly by Applethat come, essentially, as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or condition – but cost less.Quick GuideA buyer’s guide to refurbished phonesShowSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chainsCeXandGameand online stores such asmusicMagpieandEnvirofone. Marketplaces likeAmazonandeBayand refurb specialistBack Marketalso have a wide range. And some phone operators, includingO2,giffgaff,EEandVodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:Grade A– virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.Grade B– in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.Grade C– in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.Grade D– also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:Battery health– batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?Charging port– check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.Buttons– do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.Fingerprint scanner– is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.Network locks– check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.Unauthorised parts– not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.Check it isn’t stolen– check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against adatabase of stolen devicesthrough a service such asCheckMENDor similar.Warranty– what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Do not buyAny model older than an iPhone 13, because you won’t get many years of software support before you’ll have to replace it.An iPhone 13 mini unless it has a new battery. It had a relatively short battery life to start with and needed more frequent charging than larger iPhones, so its battery wears out faster.How I testedQuick GuideHow I testedShowWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us  evaluate a phone,  measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.We use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.The findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Why should you trust me?I have been reviewing consumer electronics for 16 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert.

Who would have thought Nick Cave’s feelings about ankle boots – “a bit of a disaster” – could have been make or break between him and his wife, Susie?With that in mind, we spoke to a few Guardian writers about their experiences. Did it foretell something about the relationship that would go on to blossom? Or did it require that future partner to look past what was on the outside?For me, it was a bit of both. When I first laid eyes on the person who would become my partner and the father of my child, he was wearing a Christmas jumper. It had all of the typical hallmarks: it was red, covered in snowflakes and accessorised by a hungover man. He was feeling fragile, he told me later, but you wouldn’t have known it. The ardour of his festive cheer then – heartfelt and charming – lives on, for the most part, to this day. The Christmas jumper is​, thankfully, gone. But the spirit of the person inside it, fun and kind – even in the face of, shall we say, adversity – isn’t.Dressed to impressAfter my over-a-decade-long relationship ended, my wardrobe was lacking in first-date attire. I wore a long, pale-blue Dôen dress that I’d had for years to dinner with a man travelling from Scotland to meet me – elegant, I thought, yet able to accommodate a sizeable meal. As it turned out, I hardly ate a bite. Many months later, I wore the same dress to meet his mother. On closer inspection, it turned out to be – rather unsubtly – covered from head to toe in thistle print.Leah Harper, assistant features editorDisco daysRemember what I was wearing the night I met my future wife? Are you having a laugh? It was over 20 years ago – I’d be hard pushed to recall what I was wearing yesterday. She can’t remember, either – look, we were very drunk, OK? Although given it was at an indie disco (yes, I was DJing and shedidrequest a record), I’d bet on some variation of scuffed Converse, skinny jeans and band T-shirt. Not exactly a Jasper Conran trouser suit, but at least proof that what you’re wearing isn’t the only thing that matters.Tim Jonze, associate culture editorView image in fullscreenFuzzy love … Jenny Stevens in her beloved (and not beloved) Shrimps coat.Photograph: Courtesy of Jenny StevensLove the lady, hate the coatI was wearing an amazing Shrimps coat, with a check pattern with a giant furry collar and cuffs. Our first date was in the pandemic, so it was a walk around the local park. I still love the coat but my boyfriend has since admitted he hates it. Lol.Jenny Stevens, deputy features editor‘Like a cartoon cat burglar’As all men on dating apps do, my now-partner rounded his height upwards to the nearest whole number, 6’2”. However, even with this rounding, I had a height advantage. My boyfriend chose to address this by artificially boosting his own height by repeatedly folding a sock and placing the wad under his heels, leading to what he called “a tip-toe ‘sneaking’ motion when walking, like a cartoon cat-burglar”. Three years later, a height gap of nearer four inches (I had rounded down) has been no barrier to our relationship – other than arguments about who should paint the ceiling.Frances Perraudin, deputy national editorA dress to rememberWhen I first met my boyfriend, we were both 19. We didn’t get together then, but I became lodged in his mind, in part, he told me later, because of what I was wearing: a cotton burgundy floral dress. It was incredibly cheap,reducedH&M – £15 down to £8. It was shift-shaped, with no give, and sat above the knee. I wore that dress a lot that summer, when we hung out as friends, and in the summers since. In fact I held on to it for about 12 years, which works out at about 21p per wear. But every time I wore it, he noticed it. Two children later, there is no way I could wear it, let alone find it, but I hope I haven’t lost it for good.Morwenna Ferrier, fashion and lifestyle editorskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the relationship progressed, it became the butt of our jokes, and we called it his Vegas jacket. I cannot think of a single item of clothing that so inaccurately conveys his character. He could not be less of a sparkly blazer kind of guy. His prized outfits are his “inside clothes” – Adidas jersey joggers and hoodie. Always black. Not a jazzy sheen in sight. I’ve asked him what that blazer was about, was it a (slightly misjudged) attempt to woo me? “Dunno,” he retorts. “Fashion was different back then.” Lucky for him, I saw past the shiny lapel and fell for the man on the inside … who prefers a hoodie.Abigail Radnor, lifestyle editor, Saturday MagazineBack in blackI am sure on our first date I wore an old favourite black sleeveless Uniqlo dress because it was the day after the hottest day that year and still unbearably warm. But when I went to confirm that with my boyfriend, now, eight years later, he was adamant I was wearing a long black dress with a vintage AC/DC T-shirt. A shirt I distinctly remember him mentioning, a few years ago, that he didn’t like.

Never mind, eh? Not many geckos or frogs do the quiz, so nobody was offended much.

An occasion for love, romance and same-day flower deliveries. There are plenty ofdelightful storiesabout wonderful 14 February experiences: sweet gestures, thoughtful words, serendipitous encounters.But sometimes it doesn’t go quite to plan. Guardian readers shared tales of their worst Valentine’s Day with us. If you’re feeling down this 14 February, just think – at least you’re not dating someone wanted by Interpol.Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.The lost fingertipTwenty years ago, my husband, 1.5-year-old son and I were living in California. My husband, very sweetly, decided to make me a Valentine’s Day lunch, including a ham sandwich. With a flourish of the knife, he opened the plastic packaging of the ham. He also took off the top of one of his fingers. There was a lot of blood, so I ran around finding things to wrap the hand in. It was clear he had to go to [the emergency department], but where was the top of the finger? We weren’t quick enough, and the dog ate it. The rest of the day was spent at the hospital.Fiona, 58, British ColumbiaFourth time’s the charmOne Valentine’s Day in college, I was dumped over Zoom by my long-distance boyfriend. On the call, I opened the package he’d sent me. It was a dating advice book.After being dumped at 58, I realized I was not equipped for the griefRead moreThree years later, a different partner and I had booked a trip over Valentine’s Day. The day we were meant to leave, he told me he had cancelled the reservation. When I asked what he wanted to do instead, he said: “Stop seeing each other.”Two Valentine’s Days later, my long-distance girlfriend and I were supposed to call each other and cook a meal at the same time. I got a surprise delivery of ice-cream and she cancelled our call. We broke up.Eventually, my wife broke my curse, and we have enjoyed many uneventful Valentine’s Days together since.Elyse, 28, MissouriThe one that got cancelledIn second grade, the teacher got mad at us because we were so excited to pass our Valentine’s cards to each other. She told us that Valentine’s Day was cancelled, and she proceeded to rip up all our cards in front of the class. Very traumatic for seven-year-olds.Michael, 75, ArizonaA healthy giftOn our first Valentine’s after six months of dating, he gave me a box of protein bars and a pizza cutter.JM, Illinois‘Is this from you?’On Valentine’s Day 2021, I was sat with my husband of nearly 20 years – my partner and father of my children – watching David Niven in A Matter of Life and Death. I had just found a heart-shaped crisp in the bowl and was feeding it to him lovingly when his phone pinged. Up came an image of a Valentine’s card and the words: “Is this from you?” He had sent a Valentine’s card to his 23-year-old colleague, a young woman who had not been born when we first got together. The day did not end well. Our divorce will be finalized in the next few months.Sarah, 54, Lytham St AnnesQuestioned by InterpolI had been dating a colleague slightly senior to me, and quite a bit older. He invited me to Madrid for Valentine’s weekend, and I booked a lovely hotel. We flew in on Friday evening. On Saturday, while sightseeing, we were stopped by two members of Interpol. They questioned my partner at length and demanded to see his passport. My Spanish was rudimentary at best, but from what I could glean, they thought he was a drug dealer. Later that afternoon, we went to a large art exhibition, and realized we were being followed.That evening, we went to dinner and I made a comment about maybe introducing him to my parents. But we had a heated discussion which continued through the following morning on to the plane, where we finally split up.It turned out he had a second driver’s license with a different name in his wallet, so who knows who he even was.AnonymousTough loveBack in the 1970s, I was working in a public library – my first job after leaving library school. I thought I knew it all, and was not popular with my fellow workers. There was one girl I rather fancied, and on Valentine’s Day she called me and said she would like to go on a lunch date with me. In eager anticipation, I waited on the library steps for her to turn up. And waited. And waited. I kept seeing my colleagues in the background laughing. Eventually I realized they had organized this “date” to bring me down a peg.Iain, 77, Guisboroughskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I had the romantic idea of flying over on Valentine’s Day, which fell on a Friday, to surprise her. I waited on the lawn outside the hospital where she worked, dreaming of her delight. She was surprised, but not in a good way. She made some excuse about being tired after her shift, which was understandable. I felt like a douche. Later that day, when her mood was still weird, I pressed her and found out that she had arranged for her ex-girlfriend to come and stay with her that weekend.AnonymousNudie noodlesMy partner said he was going to cook a meal for me: a starter and a pudding, the works! I arrived home from work around 6.30pm, and was surprised to see the kitchen exactly as I left it. No sign of shopping or cooking. And no sign of him.I went upstairs and into our bedroom, and he was sat up naked in bed, eating a pot noodle. He said there was one in the kitchen for me. Apparently, on his way to do the shopping, he had met up with a pal, and they spent the day in the pub.Rachel, 63, BlackfordThat’s not the toilet …My then boyfriend and I were three years into our relationship and living together. His favorite band was playing in the city on Valentine’s night. Rather than stay in with me or get me a ticket too, he went to see the concert and left me at home on my own.I enjoyed the peace and quiet. That is, until I woke up to find him drunkenly urinating in the dirty clothes hamper in the corner of the room. I marched him off to sleep on the couch. He didn’t remember a thing the next morning. That was our last Valentine’s Day together.AnonymousThere goes the stripper poleI’ve ended up in the ER on Valentine’s Day twice so far. The first time, I was at a friend’s house attending a singles-only party. This friend had a stripper pole mounted in her living room. At one point, I swung around it on my way to the kitchen for another drink. I didn’t so much swing as continue straight along, with the pole in tow. I hit my head on the corner of the coffee table, and ripped my ear in half.‘We joke that she did a long con’: couples on meeting their partner through friendsRead moreThe second time, I was in a long-distance relationship and was attempting to use one of those mould kits so I could send her a copy of my privates. I was naked, except for a ring around my parts to keep everything firm. I was using an immersion blender to mix the mould material. It thickened too fast and jammed the blender. I neglected to unplug the blender before clearing the blade with my thumb. I managed to wrap my hand in a towel, pull some clothes on, and have my roomie take me to the hospital for stitches. I didn’t realize until after I got home that I still had the ring on.Will, CaliforniaAll’s well that ends wellMy husband and I were preparing to go out to dinner. While he was in the shower, I went to put a sweet Valentine’s Day card on his desk. On his computer was an email he had just sent to a woman he was having an affair with. When confronted about it, he lied. That was the end of Valentine’s Day, and the end of our marriage.I am now remarried to a much nicer, younger, more handsome and more nurturing man, so every Valentine’s Day, I want to send my ex a thank you note!Margaret, 55, CaliforniaExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyValentine's DayDatingRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She strongly believes that we should be training people in this country to do the jobs that we need to run the country better. She said her family had come here as part of the Windrush generation because they’d been specifically asked for; that was what the country needed at the time. She objected to people coming to the UK who haven’t been invited.JoyannaWhy can’t British people do the jobs that need to be filled? My feeling is, it’s because they don’t want to. They are not made to want to. The welfare state has a lot to answer for – “You don’t have to work, it’s all right, we can dole you out some money.” I think that’s where it all went wrong.BenjaminI’m in favour of people from Europe being able to come here. I don’t want people risking their lives on small boats and then being stuck in an asylum centre, not allowed to work or contribute. It doesn’t make sense to keep people in limbo for years. In an ideal world, legal routes for migration should be administered so people don’t have to risk life and limb.JoyannaAsylum seekers come through different countries before they come here.

We both disagree with the death penalty, and feel a life sentence should mean spending longer than 14 years in prison.BenjaminThe subject of drink-driving came up. I think the sentences for that should be higher; she agreed. I don’t think people should be in prison at all for non-violent, drug-related crimes. I come at it from the point of view: it’s not society’s job to punish people, it’s just to keep others from harm.View image in fullscreenFor aftersBenjaminShe didn’t outright say she didn’t believe in the climate crisis, but was very interested in why I thought climate change was happening. I’m not a scientist, but from all I’ve read, there are climate disasters happening all over the world. As I told her, I can’t say for sure, but I trust the people who say it is happening. She did get me to agree with her that climate activists were potentially counterproductive, turning people against their cause. I see that. But at the same time, if they prove to be right, we’re going to look like idiots for not listening toCassandraand instead slinging Cassandra in jail.JoyannaI said I didn’t understand a word of it. I have never understood it. I never understood the ozone layer; I’ve never found anybody who could explain it to me. I don’t understand what humankind is doing to make all this difference.

How can you fill your home with timeless treasures and your wardrobe with “pre-loved” clothes? Here, secondhand specialists share the secrets to sourcing vintage, bartering for a bargain – and avoiding overshopping.Embrace a sense of nostalgiaView image in fullscreenEstelle Bilson’s retro workspace.Photograph: Estelle Bilson/70s House ManchesterVintage interiors offer “an invisible link to your history”, says Estelle Bilson, a broadcaster, designer and author whose book70s Housewas inspired by her time-capsule terrace in Manchester. “There are pieces here that remind me of my parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles,” she says, referencing theMad Men line: “Nostalgia is a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone.” Bilson’s father was an antiques dealer, “so a lot of my early memories are of my dad restoring furniture. I started going to auctions when I was four and I was told to sit on my hands in case I bid on anything. I don’t remember my parents ever buying new furniture.”Help the planet by buying pre-loved“By choosing secondhand, you are saving something from landfill,” says Bilson. When she goes to car boot sales, she is reminded that, most of the time, “we don’t actually need to make anything new. There are enough plates, drinking glasses and cutlery to go around.”Find your eraView image in fullscreenLaura Budds, who runs furniture and clothes shops in Norfolk.Most people are looking for mid‑century modern furniture, says Laura Budds, who ownsNorfolk Retro, a vintage furniture shop in Norwich, andNR Closet, the secondhand clothing shop next door.“Unfortunately, the supply has dwindled over the last few years. A lot of it has been shipped off to Japan and elsewhere, so it is less accessible price-wise now.” Try not to fixate on unaffordable trends, she says. “The definition of vintage is only 20 years, so we’ve started to creep into the 80s and 90s, or even beyond. Ikea from the early 2000s can be really sought-after.” Budds describes her interior style as “vintage meets modern” and recommends looking for “anything that will work in a modern interior, from any era. Not heavy Victorian pieces, but light, small pieces.”Know your budget – and stick to itView image in fullscreenDanny Sebastian enjoys the fun of the fair.Photograph: BBC StudiosAlways do research into how much something should cost, advises Danny Sebastian, the market trader turned antique dealer andBargain Huntpresenter. Whether you are attending an auction or a fair, or buying on eBay, know your upper limit and don’t go above it, “or else it can soon run away with you. You can fall in love with something and buy it for £180 and go down the road and see one for £90.” He also warns that using last-second bidding apps on eBay can lead you to go over budget.Shop from sources you can affordIf money is no object, “places likeVinteriorandPamonoare good for finding what you want quickly”, says Bilson. “Items have been restored and they have couriers in place, so you don’t have to pick things up – you may pay a premium for that.” For mid-price purchases, “there are dedicated vintage shops or centres, such asPear Mill in StockportandBygone Times in Eccleston, where things are sold by independent dealers who have done the leg work: they’ve sourced it, cleaned it and often restored it,” says Bilson.Sebastian says: “The best place to get a bargain has got to be at the big antiques fairs up and down the country.” He recommends Newark, Swinderby, Ardingly, Kempton Park and Shepton Mallet.Finding a bargain can offer the biggest thrillView image in fullscreenBargain-hunting at a car boot sale.Photograph: Connect Images/Frank and Helena/Getty Images“I will dredge the likes of Facebook Marketplace, eBay and car boot sales,” says Bilson. “For me, it’s not the styling or the owning it; it is finding it that I get a buzz from. If I can find something that is worth £200 for £1 at a car boot sale, I get a bigger thrill from that than paying £150 at a vintage centre.”What is her best recent bargain? “A pair of Anglo American sunglasses. I picked them up, thinking they were unusual, but didn’t know anything about them; I often buy on gut instinct. The seller wanted £5. I offered £3 and she said no, so I paid £5. I walked away, looked them up and they are really rare – from the 1970s and worth about £1,000. That is when I get really excited.”Budds advises caution when using Facebook Marketplace: “Anything that is good is gone within minutes and you need to be on the seller’s doorstep ready to pick it up straight away. When you get there, it is often not quite in the condition that you thought it was going to be, which is fine if you’re just buying it for yourself and you’ve got the time to do it up, but it’s not always cost-effective if you are selling it on.”(Almost) always haggle – but do it politely“I haggle for everything,” says Bilson. “You’ve got to be very polite and strong: you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. So if you go in with: ‘I really love this,’ it becomes a game. Never say: ‘What’s your best offer?’ Start instead with: ‘Can I make you an offer?’” Only pretend to walk away, which Bilson frequently does, if you can bear to live without it. “If I really want it, I will stump up the cash.”Sebastian says: “Don’t feel too shy to barter. It is expected, but always with a smile on your face and always courteously. Eight times out of 10, they will come down. Unless, of course, it’s exceedingly cheap. If it’s cheap, snap it up, because somebody else might come along. I play every trick in the book. Some people give me the deal to get rid of me.”Charity shops can be pricey, but it is all for a good causeView image in fullscreenNot the place to haggle.Photograph: Flake/Alamy“Charity shops aren’t the place to barter,” says Jen Graham, AKA@charityshopgirlcsg, who lives in Sandbach, Cheshire, and is renowned for trawling the country’s “chazzers”. “Lots of charity shops have their prices for reasons: they have rent and bills to pay, like any high-street shop. I have been there when people have tried to haggle and it makes the volunteers working there uncomfortable,” she says. Graham is an ambassador forAir Ambulanceand explains that £5 spent in one of their shops puts cannulas on an aircraft.Bilson says: “The smaller independents, like a local cat charity, tend to be quite good for bargains, rather than branches of big-name charities.”View items in person before you commit“Auction descriptions are very brief, so you do need to go there and view it yourself, pull the drawers out and make sure it is what you want,” says Budds. If you can’t see an item in person, you can request a report in advance, says Sebastian. “Then you are buying on the auctioneer’s word. If you get it home and they didn’t say it was full of scratches and whatnot, it can go back.” With Facebook Marketplace, don’t be afraid to walk away if the quality isn’t good enough, says Bilson: “Don’t feel you have to buy something.”Attend auctions in personView image in fullscreenBeing in the room gives you a better sense of which way the wind is blowing.Photograph: Farlap/Alamy“Try to be there bidding on the day and not do it remotely,” says Budds. “That is all part of the fun – and you are likely to be able to get a better price. You can judge the room and how things are going.”Sebastian says: “Get there early, look at the items, check the merchandise. Find a nice spot to sit, relax and enjoy it. There’s nothing to be fearful of.” One thing to bear in mind, he adds, is that there are buyers’ fees on top of the winning bid: “Very rarely do you pay the hammer price. There is always commission, which can range from 20% to 30%, and VAT.”Go armed with measurements“Always know your dimensions,” says Budds. “If you’ve found something for a decent price, you need to be able to snap it up there and then.” If you go home to measure, she says, chances are it won’t be there when you return. The same goes for clothing measurements, as you can’t always try on vintage garments – and sizes vary wildly through the eras, as Graham points out.Be wise to reproductionsIn the past five years, “fast interiors has grown as quickly as fast fashion”, says Budds. “You can pick up things that are pretty much exact replicas for a fraction of the price, which takes the value out of those vintage things.”Some reproductions that were made in the 90s are now considered vintage, says Bilson: “I’ve got some Harry Bertoia bar stools in my kitchen and they are not the original 60s ones, but they are functional and the aesthetic I want. If you want the look, you can pick up a vintage one that’s been made 30 years ago, as opposed to 60 years ago, more affordably.“What I don’t like is when people try to pass off something as older than it actually is.”Check for pests and flawsView image in fullscreenBe on the lookout for telltale woodworm dust.Photograph: cstock/Alamy“Look out for woodworm holes and dust on wooden furniture, because it could infest your entire house,” says Bilson. “Same for clothing and rugs: once you’ve got moths in your home, it is a nightmare. I would avoid buying mattresses, because there are a lot of issues with bedbugs now. Do your due diligence and if you’re at all worried, get it fumigated. Vintage plastics can get a bit brittle, so give it a good look over.” If you are not sure about the item’s condition, says Bilson, “don’t risk it”.Know your restoration limits“Think about the level of work that you are willing to put in,” says Budds. “You can make a lot of things look so much better by yourself, but you need to consider the material it is made of.“If it is a 70s sideboard, chances are it probably has a thin veneer on the top; you’re not going to be able to bring that back to perfect condition if it has water marks and lots of scratches. If it is a bit older and it is solid wood, you will be able to give it a good sand and oil to bring it back to its former glory.”Budds does all her own restorations: “But I’ve learned over time that some things definitely need a professional, so be aware of your own limitations.” Re-upholstery is one such skill – and it can carry a significant cost, says Bilson: “Get a good, trusted upholsterer, and you’re winning. Vintage frames are really good with new seating, because they were built to last; modern furniture, not so much.”Think about how you will get purchases homeView image in fullscreenThere are some purchases you can’t transport on the bus.Photograph: SolStock/Getty Images“If you buy something from an antiques centre that doesn’t deliver, it is going to be quite a hassle to get it home,” says Budds. “Always work out your delivery options.”Choose timeless piecesWhether it’s furniture or fashion, buy items that will stand the test of time. “Invest in solid pieces that will take you through all the seasons, whether that is a really good trenchcoat or a 100% wool blazer that you know is going to last,” says Graham. “Brands like Windsmoor, Viyella and Eastex have made beautiful coats that in 20 years will still be exactly the same.” If you are choosing a sideboard for your living room, think about where else it could go when you feel like a change, says Budds. “Don’t buy something that is only going to have one use or position in your house.”Don’t buy something just because it is a bargain“I am a hoarder by nature,” says Bilson. “Once you get the bug, there is a huge danger to overbuy, especially at car boot sales. I’ll buy loads of one thing and then realise I’ve got 50 of them. You get caught up in the dopamine hit and euphoria of buying things cheaply.” When you are tempted, she advises considering a purchase carefully: “Do I want it in my house? No. Do I have time to restore it and sell it? No. Then you have to leave it for somebody else to find, which takes great restraint.” Budds avoids buying clothes on Vinted for this reason: “Secondhand is only good if you’re still buying consciously. If you’re only buying it because it’s cheap, then we’re not really solving much.”Have a ‘one in, one out’ ruleView image in fullscreenTry to keep on top of your wardrobe.Photograph: Kanawa_Studio/Getty Images“If you buy a really nice jumper, sell or donate one from your wardrobe that you haven’t worn for a couple of months, or that doesn’t make you feel great,” says Graham. If you are donating to a charity shop, consider whether you would buy it, says Graham: “Make sure it is clean and fold your stuff up into bags; even sort it out into categories like ladieswear, menswear, bric-a-brac. Remember that charity shops are not places for you to get rid of your rubbish.”Look for spelling mistakes when searching online“You can sometimes find good stuff by searching for spelling mistakes,” says Graham. “Gucci where someone accidentally put an extra ‘C’ or one less ‘C’. I once found Louis Vuitton where the seller had put ‘Lewis’.” Bilson has been known to just search “shelves” on Facebook Marketplace and sift through every Ikea Kallax in her quest for treasure. “I’ve got a Guzzini 1970s lamp and that was just listed as ‘lamp’. It takes longer, but the rewards are greater.”Hang on to anything that might be fashionable again one dayIt is always worthkeeping thingsif you have space, says Bilson. “For the kitchen I fitted recently, I used some amazing 60s track lighting made by Nokia that I bought eight years ago. It had been living in my loft, waiting for its moment to shine.”Remember: the early bird catches the wormIf you are going to a car boot sale or a fair, set your alarm to beat other bargain hunters.“I love a car boot sale, but I don’t love how early they are,” says Graham. “You have to get there early to get the good stuff.” Likewise, look out for eBay auctions that end in the middle of the night, she says. Vintage may be timeless but if you snooze, you definitely lose.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Paragon of Black Country respectability, a “real-life Roy of the Rovers” (so said Terry Venables), the late Manchester United midfielder’s myth is as surely set as his bronze quiff. InBest and Edwards, his remarkable book about footballing fame and tragedy, Gordon Burn quotes the Austrian philosopher Robert Musil: “There is nothing as invisible as a monument.” Despitethe statue’s prominent site on the edge of Dudley’s market square, only ageing Man United pilgrims and curious travellers pause to admire it.View image in fullscreenA 1950s sweetshop in the open-air Black Country Living Museum in Dudley.Photograph: Neil McAllister/AlamyDudley’s town centre in winter drizzle is hard to appreciate, but at its edges are fine buildings: a neo-Georgian town hall and turreted former police station; a handsome Eros who has shot his arrow; the deco-influenced Fountain Arcade, dated 1925; a “sports bar”, called the Old Glasshouse, which occupies a Victorian fire station.The pint of mild and ham cob at the Bottle & Glass has me almost teary with delightA tram line is being built to connect to Wednesbury, whence to Birmingham. Canals already do this. I set off to find an entry point, my route taking me past asculpture(reels of film) dedicated to the film director James Whale – his 1931 Frankenstein established horror as a viable commercial genre and the idea of the monster as a monobrowed blockhead. Maybe the bolts through his neck were industrial Dudley’s contribution.Noise levels dip as soon as I step on to the towpath, behind a wall of chaotic shrubbery. More than 500 miles of canals crisscross the West Midlands, built to link up factories and get goods to market. Dudley had coal and limestone mining, iron, steel, engineering, glass cutting, textiles and leatherworking. The town made cranes, chains, anchors (including the 15-ton centre anchor for RMS Titanic), nails, fire grates, anvils, vices. Much has gone, but I hear clangs and bangs as I amble.View image in fullscreenShri Venkateswara (Balaji) Temple in Dudley.Photograph: Kalki/AlamySpotting a snack bar behind a palisade fence, I detour and find myself inside theShri Venkateswara (Balaji) Temple; its impressive granitegopura(pyramidal tower) takes inspiration from a mother temple in Tirupati, south India. The onsite canteen serves delicious dosas.I always expect to dislike theme parks, but theBlack Country Living Museumcatches me in just the right mood. The 1968 house is close enough to my childhood to prompt memory sensations. The vintage chocolate bars in the corner shop, just for show, likewise. The pint of mild and ham cob at the Bottle & Glass – bare benches, bay window, open fire – has me almost teary with delight. The assemblage of periods and outlets feels political: a localist mini-universe, preserved to provoke. The Living Museum’s timeline is 1712-1968: the Industrial Revolution’s outer limits. I exit, stepping back into 2025, in a hazy, wondering dreamlike state, thinking someone should send Beckham, or Ronaldo, to fetch that ball.Things to see and do:Himley Hall and Park,Dudley Time Trail,Duncan Edwards’s grave.Enniskillen, County FermanaghView image in fullscreenWall murals on the exterior of Pat’s Bar at Enniskillen.Photograph: Jackie Ellis/AlamyEnniskillen – the Island of Kathleen, Queen of the Fomorians, supernatural raiders from the sea – is at the confluence of Lower and Upper Lough Erne. North and south lie countless islands, and an amphibious ecology of rushes and reeds, waterfowl and waders. For my visit, the Atlantic was sending in great waves of rain to top it all up. The steep streets were waterfalls.Enniskillen was founded in 1612 by a charter issued by the earthly invader James VI and I. Cambridge-educated Captain William Cole was awarded agrant of land, upon which he planted a church, school, jail/court and houses for burgesses. He built bridges and refurbished and added a tower to Enniskillen Castle – which had been the medieval seat of the Maguire (Mag Uidhir) chieftains of Fermanagh. A market house and “diamond” (town square) – a common feature of Plantation towns – were placed at the centre.The signage conjures ghosts and old ways. Wall murals celebrate former inhabitants, including Oscar WildeEnniskillen’s streets have their previous functions displayed on ceramic plaques. Queen Street was formerly Barracks Street and Brewery Lane. Belmore Street was Gaol Street. Hospital Lane became Preaching Lane, which later became Wesley Street. Eden Street was Pudding Lane, after the offal from slaughterhouses. The signage, by artistEleanor Wheeler, conjures ghosts and old ways.Wall muralscelebrate former inhabitants, including Oscar Wilde, who attended the Portora Royal school.

There’s a powerful appetite for the past here.The Workhouse, which opened in 1844, has been preserved as a reminder of the famine period and its aftermath, doubling as heritage centre and business hub. “With the building, its stories, its voices and its people, we see beauty and sorrow walk hand in hand,” says historian Catherine Scott, who had the site listed in 2009 when she heard it was scheduled for demolition.The high street is two big churches, shops, banks, cafes and plenty of bars. Among the pubs,Blakes of the Hollowstands out for its bright red paintwork and Victorian interior, with beautiful tiles on the floor (replicas of those in the Catholic church) and tiny wood-panelled snugs – including one where women used to drink separately. Novelist John McGahern said: “If Irish pubs were churches, Blakes (of) the Hollow would be the cathedral of them all.”Near the top of the town is the impressive Renaissance-style town hall; the Continuity IRAexploded a bomb herein 2003. At the foot of town is the run-down, largely unused Clinton Centre, on the site of the 1987Remembrance Day IRA bombing– by the town’s cenotaph – that caused 12 deaths. The Erne curls into town a few paces away from here. By the East Bridge you remember, again, it’s an island town. The rain is now a shimmering river in spate.

Gareth Southgate’s successful stints – winning the League Cup final as a player, and beating Manchester Cityby eight goals to oneas manager – linking the Boro to the national team’s destiny, sealed this status. Google searches prioritise the team and local news media conflate it with the town.The discovery of iron ore turned Middlesbrough into a foundry town – Sydney Harbour Bridge was built right hereMiddlesbrough is a port but not on the coast, a railway town but not on the mainline, a Victorian creation but not one wrapped in aspic and conservation orders. If it’s in the middle, between the religious centres of Durham and Whitby (a Benedictine priory once stood at Middlesbrough), or the Esk and the Wear rivers, it’s also at the farthest edge of its historic county: Yorkshire. “North Riding” evokes dales, moors, the safe Tory seat of Richmond, real ale; Teesside is its dark, ripped-out workers’ heart.Hardly bigger than a village when the church of St Hilda’s was consecrated in 1840, Middlesbrough grew on the back of the Stockton & Darlington Railway. This was extended to the staithes at Port Middlesbrough, from which Durham coal was exported far and wide. Wharves were built, workshops constructed and lifting engines installed.View image in fullscreenThe Tees Transporter Bridge, which opened in 1911.Photograph: Philip Silverman/Getty ImagesAs Middlesbrough grew, its boundaries expanded south of the railway. The older northern area is sometimes known as “Over the Border” – an impression reinforced by the A66. Much has been demolished, including St Hilda’s (captured by Lowry in 1959) and the oldest pub, the Ship Inn. Somewhat stranded survivors are the small Italianate-style 1846 town hall,Queen’s Terraceand the French baroque formerNational and Provincial Bank.The discovery of major iron ore deposits in the Cleveland Hills in the mid-19th century turned Middlesbrough into a foundry town – and a giant of heavy engineering. TheTees Transporter Bridge, opened in 1911, is the longest existing transporter bridge in the world. Sydney Harbour Bridge was built right here by Dorman Long & Co Ltd. Middlesbrough Ironopolis FC won the Northern League three times in its five-year history. More than 30 pubs slaked the collective thirst; they are gone or lie inruins.Middlesbrough grew from 25 people in 1801 to over 90,000 by 1900. There was barely room to breathe. It has been called a “town famous for its asthmatic qualities”. Locals have reappropriated the put-down nickname “Smoggies”, proud of their working history. But the “burgh” in the “middle” is also between blast furnaces and green hills, a would-be city with rural views. Pig iron. Soft hearts. Strong heads. A down-to-earth dignity characterises people who can still harbour anostalgia for the future.Things to see and do:Dorman Museum,MIMA,North York Moors national park.Chris Moss’s visits were supported by theWest Midlands Growth CompanyandVisit Ireland.Explore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysWhere tourists seldom treadShort breaksDay tripsEngland holidaysNorthern Ireland holidaysCultural tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, he waited for the world to change around him,” the foreign policy source said, referring to Trump’s election and his administration’s radically different foreign policy outlook.The call between the two leaders took place just hours after the US defence secretary told officials in Brussels that Ukraine would need toabandon its ambitions of joining Natoand accept territorial losses, in effect conceding to some of Russia’s demands even before negotiations began.Map showing Russian control in UkraineViewed as a whole, the rapidly unfolding events will probably be seen in Moscow as the culmination of Putin’s months-long diplomaticoverturesto Trump, during which he lauded the president’s braveness and intelligence and echoed some of his favourite narratives, including unfounded claims that the 2020 US election was stolen from Trump.“Now, Putin’s main focus is Trump – everyone else is irrelevant,” the foreign policy source said. “His next move is to secure a closed-door meeting with Trump, where he can further press his case,” the source added, saying they believed the two leaders could soon meet for a summit in Saudi Arabia.0:48'I don't think it's practical': Trump on Nato membership for Ukraine – videoThe mood in Moscow’s political circles was buoyant on Thursday morning. Several pro-Kremlin observers pointed to the timing of the call between the two leaders, noting that Trump only informed Volodymyr Zelenskyy afterwards, in effect imposing the terms of the conversation on the Ukrainian president.“Zelenskyy had repeatedly urged Trump to speak with him first before engaging with Putin. Instead, Trump did the exact opposite,” gloated Sergei Markov, a popular Russian commentator.Many also celebrated Putin’s invitation for the US president to visit Moscow, which the Kremlin later hinted was for the 9 May Victory Day parade.The once-unthinkable image of a US leader seated beside Putin, watching Russian soldiers who fought in Ukraine march across Red Square in the country’s grandest display of power, no longer feels so far-fetched. If it came to pass, it would deal a devastating blow to the west’s three-year effort to diplomatically isolate the Russian president.“The promise to exchange visits is a victory for Putin. Any dictatorship sees a visit from the US president as the highest form of international legitimacy, almost a magical ritual that lifts a diplomatic curse,” said Alexander Baunov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace thinktank.Russian officials were quick to highlight Europe’s complete exclusion from the peace talks, as European leaders struggled to come to terms with being sidelined.“Frigid spinster Europe is mad with jealousy and rage,” said the former president Russian Dmitry Medvedev. “It’s been shown its real place; its time is over.”Summing up the day, the state TV host Evgeny Popovdeclaredon Wednesday that Trump was in effect doing Moscow’s job by tearing the western world apart. “We wanted to chainsaw the western world into pieces, but he decided to cut through it himself,” Popov cheered.In a tangible sign of optimism from Moscow’s business community, the Moscow exchange surged more than 6% on Thursday, while the rouble climbed to its strongest level since the summer. Shares of big Russian companies, including Gazprom and Rostelecom, jumped by more than 8%, as businesses anticipated that a potential peace deal could reverse some of the thousands of sanctions imposed on the country.“Investors dreamed about this scenario but did not really believe it was possible,” the Cifa Broker chief analyst, Ovanes Oganisyan,toldthe business newspaper Kommersant.Still, observers in and outside Moscow believe negotiations could be drawn out and fraught with uncertainty, with Russian success far from guaranteed. In its readout on Wednesday, the Kremlin struck a sober tone while maintaining a maximalist stance, with Putin saying he had “mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict”.In Kremlin parlance, this signals that Putin is likely to push for greater territorial control in Ukraine beyond what Russia now holds, as well as demand regime change in Kyiv – conditions that even a Trump administration may struggle to accept.Few believe Putin would ever agree to the prospect of tens of thousands of European peacekeeping troops on Russia’s border, a scenario proposed by Hegseth on Wednesday.“The positions of the parties differ significantly and, at this moment, seem incompatible,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a prominent Russian political analyst and the founder of R Politik, a political analysis company.“For Putin, a real solution means a Ukraine that is ‘friendly’ to Russia – deprived of military capability, which has a rewritten constitution and guarantees non-membership in Nato.”Stanovaya said Putin was “fully prepared” for the talks to collapse and to press ahead with the fighting, confident in his battlefield superiority and bolstered by Trump’s reluctance to supply Ukraine with additional weapons. “From the Kremlin’s perspective, there is nothing the west can do that would reverse Russia’s territorial gains and prevent Ukraine’s collapse in the long run,” she said.There were also grumblings about the phone call and the possibility of peace talks from Russia’s far-right camp, which has gained significant influence over the course of the war. “Trump will ‘allow’ Russia to take what it has conquered – but no more, of course. Meanwhile, he’ll offer Ukraine some guarantees,” said the prominent Russian ultranationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin on his Telegram channel.“He’ll plant himself right in the middle ofourUkraine. Let me remind you, all of Ukraine is ours. All of Ukraine is Russian land,” Prilepin said.Putin has largely embraced Russia’s fiercely pro-war faction, though he has, at times,purgedthose who have criticised his leadership for being too lenient in prosecuting the war.Still, for now, optimism in Moscow prevails. “At times, many in the elites questioned whether it was wise for Putin to start the war or not settle for peace earlier,” said a well-connected businessman in Moscow. “Now, few are asking that question – his gamble is starting to pay off.”Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinRussiaUkraineDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

In an area known as one of Kingston’s inner-city crime hotspots, it was founded as a haven for children caught up in gang violence.Inside, boys in smart khaki uniforms and girls in yellow shirts and pleated burgundy skirts sit chatting in groups. The classrooms are adorned with images of Jamaican heroes, such as Marcus Garvey and past prime ministers – a reminder to the children, says the principal, Robert Dixon, of what they might one day accomplish.But outside the school walls, the stark reality of crime and poverty is clear. Modest if colourful painted houses are secured by burglar bars; others are crudely built with zinc sheets and bits of wood.Along the road are makeshift speed bumps, constructed by locals to prevent drive-by shootings. Some streets detour into an intricate maze of alleys sandwiched by zinc-sheet walls. Originally created as shortcuts, such “chappies” or “trappies” are often used by people running from the police.On a recent afternoon, a line of army vehicles had pulled up not too far from the school by a barrier of drums, tyres and tree branches.Two soldiers in moss-green combat uniforms and bulletproof jackets stood at the entrance of a house, rifles held across their chests, as angry neighbours shouted and filmed them with their mobiles.View image in fullscreenRobert Dixon, principal of Operation Restoration Christian School, teaches in Trench Town, Kingston, Jamaica.Photograph: Anthony Lugg/The Guardian“We heard someone shouting, ‘Murder, murder!’ inside,” cried one woman who said her uncle was one of two men who lived there. “We are not seeing my uncle so we are not sure if he is alive or dead,” she said.The incident came amid a crackdown launched last month by Jamaican authorities after a spike in homicides. Late in January, there was a fresh wave of unrest after thefatal police shootingof the powerful gang boss Othneil “Thickman” Lobban. States of emergency were declared in parts of the country, giving the police additional powers to conduct searches and arrest suspects.Jamaica has one of the highesthomicide ratesin the region, and in recent years it has struggled with a surge in gang-related violence.But official figures show a13% drop in murdersin January compared with the same month last year, reflecting a downwards trend in homicide rates over the past two years. Meanwhile, the number of people fatally shot by security forces in January rose from 13 in 2024 to 28 this year.Experts say that the figures reflect an anti-crime strategy that needs to be broadened to address problems rooted in a complex combination of social, political and economic factors. Dr Herbert Gayle, an anthropologist of gang violence at the University of the West Indies, warned that the police were under unsustainable pressure, which risked creating a situation in which officers are “war-ready”.“War-ready people suffer from fear. And if they are suffering from the ‘fear factor’, they may harm people unnecessarily,” he said. To address the root causes of violent crime, many of which are related to money, a range of ministries need to be involved, not just the security forces. And education, he added, should be one of the priorities.View image in fullscreenArmy vehicles sit near a makeshift barricade on a street in the Trench Town neighbourhood of Kingston.Photograph: Anthony Lugg/The GuardianThe experiences of students at the Operation Restoration school illustrate the scale of the challenge. The school – founded by Lorna Stanley, who was later recognised for her contributions to the community with a Jamaica Order of Distinction – supports pupils aged 12 to 17 struggling with numeracy and literacy. But while the children are full of potential, the challenge, said Dixon, is that they are battling past traumas.One 14-year-old girl whose parent was shot dead when they were just an infant, said that the sight of guns was an everyday part of life, adding: “Most of the time, we’re afraid. Most of the time, we just accept it because it’s normal.”She said: “I want to see more joy, less gun violence, less killing. I want to see less of those gangs that call themselves different names in my community.”Dixon said he had seen how the power of education can turn “wayward boys and girls into law-abiding, productive citizens, with some becoming agents of change within their communities”.But he warned that it was an uphill battle for children who are often caught in a cycle of crime. “I have children who saw their parents killed in front of them, so there is also an intergenerational element, it’s like the trauma is passed down. These children have learned to respond to conflict with immediate threats or violence.”Diana Thorburn, an expert from the Jamaican thinktankCaribbean Policy Research Institute, said that schools alone cannot tackle the instability of the home environment that many children return to every day or the governance of communities, which are often controlled by powerful criminal overlords, known as dons, she said.“Improving primary education is essential. But there’s only so far that that can go when you consider the other factors that contribute to outcomes. Many of these communities are ungoverned spaces. The state can’t go in there. The state doesn’t even know how many people are in there. They are not paying for electricity. They are not paying for water. Some of them don’t even have papers, such as birth certificates.“The political structures of those communities, the governance structures of those communities, the fact that those communities are fundamentally insecure and that they serve as safe havens for gangs – that is the root of the problem.”View image in fullscreenA mural at Operation Restoration Christian School in Trench Town.Photograph: Anthony Lugg/The GuardianAny kind of solution for such communities should start with basics such as regularising land ownership so people have a legal claim to where they live, Thorburn said.Jamaica’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, has called for aglobal war on gangs. The threats facing Jamaica, he said, were transnational and required greater international coordination.Holness has pledged to rid communities of the gangs, which he said were responsible for more than 70% of murders in Jamaica, and the gang bosses who often take on leadership roles in communities.Bukele-mania: El Salvador strongman’s crime clampdown excites regional rightRead moreAppealing to communities to stop supporting gangs, hesaidin a statement: “There is a sense, and we have seen it displayed publicly, that somehow the gangs are protectors of the community or are your friends. The gangs are not your protectors, they are not your friends, they are using you.“The plan of the government is not to target and harm communities in pursuit of the gangs. The strategy of the government is to separate gangs and criminals from the community and law-abiding citizens.”Gayle stressed that any strategy to remove gangs should also focus on removing the “system or the pool from which they are recruited”.He said:“You can remove a person who is taking care of a hundred young people and helping a hundred children to go to school. But if the state does not take on those hundred children what do you think will happen?“So we can remove dons now and we may even see quick impact, but in months - usually between 18 and 24 months – as gangs readjust, we see a spike back in the murders. And you know what the trend is eventually? Going up, going up, going up.”Explore more on these topicsJamaicaAmericasCaribbeanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was produced in partnership with thePulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Networkand theMarkup, now a part ofCalMatters, and co-published with theGuardianand the19th.When a young woman in Denver met up with a smiling cardiologist she matched with on the dating app Hinge, she had no way of knowing that the company behind the app had already received reports from two other women who had accused him of rape.She met the 34-year-old doctor with green eyes and thinning hair at Highland Tap & Burger, a sports bar in a trendy neighborhood. It went well enough that she accepted an invitation to go back to his apartment. As she emerged from his bathroom, he handed her a tequila soda.What transpired over the next 24 hours, according to court testimony, reads like every person’s dating app nightmare.After sipping the drink, the woman started to lose control. Her memory blurred. She fell to the ground, and the man started to film her. He put her in a headlock, kissing her forehead; she struggled to free herself but managed to grab her things and leave. He followed her out the door, holding her shoes and trying to force her back inside, but she was able to call an Uber, vomiting in the car on the way home.She woke up at home, soaking wet on her bathroom floor, the key to her house still in her door. She continued vomiting for hours. When she came to, she reported the assault to Hinge.Hinge is one of more than a dozen dating apps owned by Match Group. The $8.5bn global conglomerate also owns brands likeTinder(the world’s most popular dating app), OKCupid and Plenty of Fish. Match Group controls half of the world’s online dating market, operates in 190 countries and facilitates meetups for millions of people.Match Group’sofficial safety policystates that when a user is reported for assault, “all accounts found that are associated with that user will be banned from our platforms”.So why, on the night of 25 January 2023, was Stephen Matthews still on the app? Just four days before, Match Group had been alerted when another woman reported him for rape. A little more than a week later, he was reported for rape again. This time, the survivor went to the police.None of these women knew that the company had known about his violent behavior for years. He was first reported on 28 September 2020. By then, Match Group’s safety policy was already in place.Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested – the only thing that got him off the apps. At least 15 women would eventually report that Matthews had raped or drugged them. Nearly every one of them had met him on dating apps run by Match Group.View image in fullscreen‘Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested – the only thing that got him off the apps.’Photograph: Anson ChanOn 25 October,a Denver judge sentenced Matthews to 158 years to life in prisonafter a jury convicted him of 35 counts related to drugging and sexually assaulting eight women, drugging two women and assaulting one more for a total of 11 women. Attorneys for the women said much of that violence could have been prevented.“It is shocking that for years after receiving reports of sexual assault, Hinge continued to allow Stephen Matthews access to its platforms and actively facilitated his abuse,” said Laura Wolf, the attorney representing the woman whose police report led to the arrest. Following best practices for reporting on sexual assault, theDatingApps Reporting Project is honoring survivors’ requests for anonymity. Matthews’s attorney, Douglas Cohen, declined to comment. A letter that the Dating Apps Reporting Project sent directly to Matthews in jail went unanswered.Match Group’s reach is so massive – its mission is “to spark meaningful connections for every single person worldwide” – that peopleare more likely to meet through its appsthan out at the bars, at church or through friends.But Matthews’s case shows that even as these apps have made it easier for people to connect with a seemingly endless pool of potential lovers, they have also made it easier for people who commit sexual abuse to reach a seemingly endless number of potential targets.In 2022, a team of researchers at Brigham Young University published ananalysisof hundreds of sexual assaults in Utah. They found that attacks facilitated by dating apps happened faster and were more violent than when the perpetrator met the victim through other means. They also found that perpetrators who used dating apps were more likely to target vulnerable people. Almost 60% of sexual assault survivors self-reported a mental illness.Match Group has known since at least 2016 which users have been reported for drugging, assaulting or raping their dates, according to internal company documents. Since 2019, Match Group’s central database has recorded every user reported for rape and assault across its entire suite of apps; by 2022, the system, known as Sentinel, was collecting hundreds of troubling incidents every week, company insiders say.Match Group promisedin 2020that it would release what’s known as a transparency report – a public document that would reveal data on harm occurring on and off its platforms. If the public were aware of the scale of rape and assault on Match Group apps, they would be able to accurately assess their risk. As of February 2025, the report has not been released.Instead, as people continued to get hurt, the company dithered over what damning information should be hidden. “Do we publish only where we are required by law?” reads a slide in a 2021 presentation shown multiple times to Match Group employees as well as to external safety partners. “Do we push back on how much we are required to reveal, or do we try to go beyond what is required?”View image in fullscreenScreenshot of an 8 April 2021 Match Group presentation about the company’s transparency-reporting strategy.Photograph: MarkupNo online space is risk-free. But while Match Group has long possessed the tools, financial resources and investigative procedures necessary to make it harder for bad actors to resurface, internal documents show the company resisted efforts to spread them across its apps, in part because safety protocols could stall corporate growth.“The obsession with metrics and having to stick with them is frustrating and potentially dangerous,” one employee wrote in 2021 after the company learned that the investigative news non-profit ProPublica was planning a story. “This is not the way we were meant to work and people’s lives are at risk.”View image in fullscreenScreenshot of a 2021 document with a Match Group employee’s feedback.Photograph: MarkupThe same person asked their superiors: “‘How much would you personally pay to stop just one person being sexually assaulted by a date, one child being trafficked or one vulnerable person being driven to suicide by a predator?’ I feel that if I asked members of our staff that question individually, they would put a high value of their own money on it – but as a group nobody is ready to hear that yet.”Since 2021, Match Group has publicly promised to improve the safety of their products and to share data, but company insiders say safety has not improved. A brief hiring spree sparked by congressional and media scrutiny has been largely scaled back, according to former employees. In 2024, the remaining employees from the central trust-and-safety team Match Group had set up in response to increased scrutiny were let go and their jobs outsourced to overseas contractors. Facing pressure from Wall Street, Match Group removed its CEO, Bernard Kim, in early February 2025 as he struggled to cut costs and end the steady decline in subscribers to Match Group’s most powerful app,Tinder.Members of Congress have repeatedly requested data from Match Group on sexual harm. In February 2020, 11 members ofCongress wroteto then CEO Shar Dubey asking for details on how the company responds to reports of sexual violence. In July 2023, two Democrats, the then representative Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and the representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois followed up after we inquired on the status of their efforts. The company has still not provided the data.In September 2024, the House of Representativespassed a billthat would have required consumers to be notified if they had interacted with a user on a dating app who had been banned for defrauding consumers of money or personal financial information. But the bill stopped short of addressing the issue of sexual assault on the apps, and it died in the Senate.Our review of hundreds of pages of internal company documents, along with thousands of pages of court records, securities filings and analyst reports, coupled with dozens of interviews with current and former employees and survivors of sexual violence found that women who report being raped get no traction, while accused rapists like Stephen Matthews keep swiping – and assaulting.Our own testing on Match Group apps showed that as of February 2025, not much had changed. Banned Tinder users, including those reported for sexual assault, would easily rejoin or move to another Match Group dating app, all while keeping most of their key personal information exactly the same.The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent Match Group a four-page letter detailing our findings. The company responded with a short statement. The statement did not dispute that Match Group had carefully documented the extent of harm on company apps for years without sharing that information with the public. It also defended the company’s efforts to make platforms safe.“We recognize our role in fostering safer communities and promoting authentic and respectful connections worldwide,” the statement provided by Kayla Whaling, senior director of communications, read. “We will always work to invest in and improve our systems, and search for ways to help our users stay safe, both online and when they connect in real life.”The company said it vigorously combats violence. “We take every report of misconduct seriously, and vigilantly remove and block accounts that have violated our rules regarding this behavior,” its statement read.Our own testing found otherwise.Starting in April 2024, the Dating Apps Reporting Project created a series of Tinder accounts that we subsequently reported for sexual assault. Soon after, Tinder banned the accounts, and we started investigating how easy it would be for a banned user to create new accounts.Repeatedly, we found that users, soon after being banned, could create new Tinder accounts with the exact same name, birthday and profile photos used on their banned accounts. Users banned from Tinder were also able to sign up for Hinge, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish without changing those personal details.To get around the Tinder ban, we used techniques commonly suggested by online guides and forums that don’t require much technical knowledge to understand. We were able to verify three techniques that allowed banned Match Group users to repeatedly bypass being flagged when creating new accounts.In its statement, Match Group cast itself as an industry leader in deploying technology to promote safety, including “harassment-preventing AI tools, ID verification for profiles, and a portal that helps us better support and communicate with law enforcement investigating crimes. … Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences. We are committed to doing the work to make dating safer on our platforms and beyond.”28 September 2020 – the date Denver cardiologist Stephen Matthews raped a woman who reported him to Hinge – is also the date Tracey Breeden was brought on as Match Group’s head of safety and social advocacy.Breeden was a flashy hire. “With Tracey coming on board, we are reaffirming our commitment not just to be safety leaders in the dating space, but across the entire tech sector,” then CEO Shar Dubey said.Sporting a trademark black leather jacket and short, slick-backed hair, Breeden had gone by the nickname “Tornado” during her 15-year career in law enforcement. What made her attractive to Match Group was her most recent job at Uber: she had helped the global ride-hailing company revive its reputation after a series of scandals, from persistent reports of harassment of female employees to allegations that it was ignoring sexual assault that occurred during Uber rides.Breeden spearheaded a safety report in 2019 that told the public what Uber knew about nearly every problem, including nationwide reports of intoxicated drivers, traffic fatalities and incidents of sexual violence. The report became a key metric of success for the company.In hiring Breeden, Match Group hoped to replicate this success across its portfolio of apps. “Corporations,” she said in a press release announcing her arrival, “have a responsibility to help ensure safe experiences for their users”.Breeden’s team garnered public attention for their new safety measures, including partnerships with NGOs, optional AI-assisted photo verification and a law-enforcement portal where police and prosecutors could request data.She also fostered a partnership with Garbo, a startup that offered low-cost background checks.It launched on Tinder in 2022.Experts point out that background checks are not always reliable as they pull from outdated databases, andresearchsuggests that most people who commit sexual abuse do not encounter the criminal justice system. For example, Matthews had no criminal record.During this time, Match Group invested $100m in safety, the company said, and boasted about Breeden’s “central safety team”.Her team of veteran safety professionals referred to themselves as “the Avengers”, even donning superhero costumes at company events.View image in fullscreenAn Avengers Zoom background, displayed at a Match Group company event.Photograph: MarkupBut Michael Lawrie called this “safety theater”.Lawrie worked for Match Group for nearly a decade, shaping and leading a safety team for one of the company’s smaller brands, OKCupid. Sometimes working 80-hour weeks, he spent hours, even days, sniffing out savvy users who tried to thwart bans by creating multiple accounts.Over a 30-year career in content moderation, Lawrie said, he saw many users like Stephen Matthews. “You’re dealing with one repeat offender. I’ve dealt with God knows how many repeat offenders,” he said.A yellow Post-it note on the side of Lawrie’s work computer had listed out some of his responsibilities: “Rape flags. … Investigate miscreants.”These days, Lawrie is trying to start an advocacy organization for content moderators and other frontline safety workers. But, he said, he’s done with dating apps.“I don’t think they’re safe enough at the moment,” he said. “They’re going to get worse. … I’m hoping dating sites vanish.”Lawrie said he was initially excited about Breeden’s hire. He said she spent her first few months on the job talking to each brand’s safety team and told him that she was “very impressed” by the work OKCupid was doing.View image in fullscreenMichael Lawrie, former head of user safety and advocacy at OKCupid.Photograph: Courtesy of Michael LawrieLeaders from each of Match Group’s biggest apps provided their self-described strengths and weaknesses to Breeden’s team, according to an internal spreadsheet. At Hinge, these weaknesses included a “very rudimentary warning system with no targeted comms and no follow through” and “no way to find” the original profile “of a bad actor who has created multiple profiles”.Breeden was confronted with an existential problem. “Our current ban categories won’t allow us to answer the public’s biggest question: Am I likely to be harmed on my date?” reads a slide in a presentation drafted by her team in April 2021. While each of Match Group’s apps had a system of reporting and banning violent users, the information was disorganized, and none of the apps talked to each other.View image in fullscreenA slide from a 2021 Match Group presentation.Photograph: MarkupLawrie hoped Breeden would improve safety at the company. But he quickly grew frustrated that neither she nor Match Group leadership listened to his pleas for what they really needed to make platforms safer: to hire trained – and expensive – investigators and integrate powerful moderation tools across all the apps.OKCupid already had those tools. Lawrie was using them every day.One of those was the Sentinel system, which had been up and running across Match Group’s apps for at least five years before Breeden arrived. It worked like this: when a user was banned for something serious – like sexual assault – a case was created in Sentinel with the phone number and email address associated with their account. In interviews, multiple current and former employees described how those reports circulated through each of Match Group’s apps. The system was designed to ban anyone who used that information. It also grabbed the original profile’s IP addresses, photos and birthdate.View image in fullscreenAn example of a banned user in Sentinel, with sensitive information redacted by the Markup.Photograph: MarkupSuch a system seems robust at first glance – but none of the Match Group’s apps required users to provide photo identification (the kind needed to buy alcohol or board an airplane), so once a person was kicked out, they would easily start a new account with different contact information. A quick search yielded scores of online forums with clear steps and suggestions for how to rejoin the apps. In addition, internal company documents showed that information on IP addresses, photos and birthdate were not used to ban a user if they appeared on another Match dating app.Lawrie’s team at OKCupid knew Sentinel could only do so much.So his team deployed other tools to fix its shortcomings, including one that could automatically ban a profile that was linked to a phone number, photo or URL that had been previously banned – even if the user made an account with a different email or IP address. This tool was designed to be proactive rather than reactive, so that the profiles of alleged perpetrators like Matthews would not resurface after they had been reported.Internal company documents from 2019 and 2020 show thousands of reports of “serious physical assault”, abuse and violence on OKCupid that were deemed serious enough to get users banned from all of Match Group’s apps. This is among the information the company kept from the public.Breeden and Match Group leadership praised Lawrie and his team at OKCupid, he said, for their thorough investigative work and for handling some of the company’s most difficult cases. Yet, he said, Match Group never built out a skilled, experienced investigative unit at other brands like the one he headed up at OKCupid. Under Breeden’s leadership, he said, they faced pressure to speed up investigations and train outsourced labor to use complicated moderation tools.In 2021, a week after adamning articlerevealed that content moderators with little training were asked to rapidly deal with violent sexual content across Match Group’s brands, then CEO Dubey sent out an all-staff email addressing the controversy. She CC’d Breeden, acknowledging that the brand’s safety teams were not all on equal footing.As Match Group prepared internally for the story to break, Lawrie was asked to write a report for Breeden outlining his team’s accomplishments “to make sure when Tracey describes and acknowledges what you are doing individually to celebrate the good work that you are doing”.Lawrie used that report to protest.“Most professionals aren’t judged on how many cases they can hurry through in an hour,” he wrote. The way Match Group expected its trust-and-safety and support teams to work “basically diminishes their skills and makes them production-line workers”.Breeden declined to comment for this story, citing a nondisclosure agreement.Lawrie left the company in 2022 and said most of his small team that had been ferreting out malicious users also left due to a negative workplace environment. He said much of their work was outsourced to contractors with little training and severe quotas.He now cautions anyone using a dating app to understand that the apps are not in the business of protecting users.“You’re on your own pretty much,” he said.As Lawrie was getting pushed out of Match Group, Matthews kept appearing on the company’s apps.One crisp fall evening in 2022, one of the Denver cardiologist’s old medical school classmates was on Hinge when her phone screen filled up with a familiar face.Matthews was being promoted on the app as a Standout, a popular profile that Hinge’s algorithm thinks another user will like. To match with a Standout, users must send the person a rose. They get one free rose a week, but they cost $3.99 a pop after that. His classmate did not send Matthews a rose.View image in fullscreenDespite having been reported for rape to Hinge, Stephen Matthews’s profile was promoted on the app as a Standout, as indicated by the rose icon in the bottom-right corner.Photograph: Pulitzer Center/MarkupBy this point, Matthews had already been reported for rape at least once to Hinge. Court documents show that he had already allegedly sexually assaulted nine women and drugged 10. Not only did the apps allow him back on, they featured Matthews’s profile.As the Covid-19 pandemic dragged on, people got tired of forking money over for dating apps. Match Group still made a hefty profit, but its growth flatlined. Its stock cratered, losing nearly half its value between October 2021 and April 2022. That month, an analyst from JP Morganwrote thatthe firm had received more messages about “the underperformance of MTCH shares in recent weeks than any other topic”.In May 2022, Match ousted Dubey as CEO and installed Bernard Kim, a former executive at the gaming company Zynga that had popularized viral games like FarmVille.While Dubey spoke frequently about trust and safety and worked closely with Breeden, Kim hardly mentioned safety when he began his time at Match Group, instead emphasizing the need for continued rapid expansion to drive long-term shareholder value.Lawrie said that Kim, with his background in gaming rather than dating apps, had no interest in love. “He just wants to make money. He’s just there to increase profits,” Lawrie said. “If he’s looking at a bottom line, then it’s easier to have a lawsuit than it is to provide safety. I know which one he’s gonna pick.” Match Group declined to make Kim available for an interview. Messages sent to Kim directly went unreturned.While the tension between growth and safety exists across the tech sector, it is especially high at dating-app companies where executives have to worry about constant churn – users leaving the apps when they are no longer looking for dates. Every time Match Group delivers on its promise, it loses customers.In February 2024, six dating-app usersfiled what they hope will be certified as a class-action lawsuit. They argue Match Group uses “addictive” features to encourage compulsive use while not leading to any real increase in off-app relationships. “The app is designed specifically to hook them, and to keep them paying subscription fees – not to help them find love,” attorney Ryan Clarkson said. Match Group filed to dismiss the lawsuit in September, noting in its quarterly report that it “will defend vigorously” against the allegations.Despite Kim’s efforts, Match Group’s stock price continued to drop, and during that time, so did any mention of trust and safety. In more than a year of quarterly investor calls, Kim only referenced safety efforts once.Employees who pushed for these initiatives were forced out or laid off, including Breeden – a leader who was so convinced of her own invincibility that she showed up to an event wielding a Captain America shield.View image in fullscreenShar Dubey (left), then CEO of Match Group, speaking with Tracey Breeden (right).Photograph: Pulitzer Center/MarkupMatch Group fired its power hire in October 2022. Layoffs hit her team over the next several months. In February 2024, the remaining critical investigators and law enforcement liaisons on Breeden’s central safety team were shown the door.Lawrie said group chats of former Match Group employees have been gossiping about the cutbacks.“You’re not going to see them taking safety seriously ever again,” he said, adding that the only thing he thinks might change that is legislation.Four months before Matthews was arrested, a post on a Facebook group in Denver blew up, right around Christmas.Among posts warning other women about potentially harmful men,over and over again women furiously detailed negative experiences they or their friends had had with Matthews.Some women described him as “sketchy”. Others called him “terrible” and “not safe”. Multiple women told a similar, dark story: that they had been offered drinks, blacked out and were sexually assaulted.The thread reached 150 comments. Two women wrote the same thing: that they had been waiting for someone to post about the cardiologist.The flood of Facebook comments mirrored details in the police reports released the following year. Nearly all of the 16 women included in the district attorney’s initial complaints had been offered tequila. Eight recalled playing Jenga. Six mentioned a hot tub.As these stories circulated in this small corner of the internet in December 2022, the Denver cardiologist stayed on Match Group apps.Those fortunate enough to know about the Facebook group – and who had the foresight to check for Matthews on it – would be saved from a bad date or worse. But the fact that he could still log in to Tinder and Hinge left him with a pool of thousands of unsuspecting women whom he could – and would – continue to match with.The Dating Apps Reporting Project is aware of four additional women who have accused Matthews of drugging and/or raping them who were not part of the criminal complaint. Each of these women met Matthews on a Match Group app during a single year between the summers of 2020 and 2021.During the years Matthews was on their apps, Match Group hired and fired Breeden. It made loud promises on sexual violence, announced initiatives and product lines and promised a transparency report. But it was not straight with the public, which meant the women matching with Matthews on Match Group apps were not aware of the risk they faced.Match Group’s partnership with Garbo, the background-check company, also fell apart in the summer of 2023. “It’s become clear that most online platforms aren’t legitimately committed to trust and safety for their users,” Garbo wrote in asearing blog post.After spending so much energy talking about monetization, gamification and growth, Kim began to publicly acknowledge this problem. Speaking at the Citibank conference in the fall of 2023, he said the company was investing in new features to make sure “women have a good experience while they’re in the product. They feel safe. They feel secure. Etc.”The “etc” does not seem to include increased transparency about safety. Instead, in May 2023, Tinder released a “female-focused package”, a curated list of “high-quality profiles”. It is unclear how Tinder determines these high-quality matches. Hinge’s Standout feature, which is similar, had previously promoted Matthews.In fact, under Kim’s leadership, all mentions of a transparency report disappeared from the company’s annual impact report. Ironically, this was around the same time that new legislation in Europe required tech companiesto disclose reportsof “non-consensual behavior” and other issues. Match Group will be required to submit a transparency report to the European Union on the scope of harm on their platforms later this month. Lawmakers in India and Australia are also demanding transparency.This is exactly the situation Breeden and her team pondered three years ago. “What if publishing in one jurisdiction sparks a requirement in another?” read a slide in the same internal presentation where Match Group’s trust-and-safety leaders wondered whether they should “push back on how much [they] are required to reveal”.After Match Group published a disappointing earnings report in February 2025 that fell below analysts’ expectations, it also announced that Kim would be replaced by the former Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. Tinder’s revenue, sales and subscribers had all gone down.As Match Group struggles to reverse its decline, it’s also aware that its reputation is in the spotlight. Earnings calls and shareholder letters over the first three quarters of 2024 indicate that the company knows it is a business imperative to make women feel safer on its platforms. Match Group brought in a new vice-president of trust and safety whose job partly focuses on complying with increased global transparency requirements. The company is experimenting with requiring faces in photos and rolled out a “Share My Date” feature so you can be tracked while meeting up with an online stranger. On Tinder, it orchestrated a “major ecosystem cleanup” geared toward identifying fake profiles and getting scammers off the app.But neither the cleanup nor tracking a date from your phone would have stopped Matthews – a man who never sought to hide his identity, who assaulted his dates in his own home – from finding and harming women.Four years after Matthews’s first documented assault, he walked into a wood-paneled courtroom in Denver and was sentenced to 158 years to life in prison. “I will sentence. I cannot heal,” the judge, Eric Johnson, told the room filled with survivors and family members.“Countless women have suffered and will continue to suffer,” said Laura Wolf, the attorney who represented the woman whose police report triggered Matthews’s arrest. “Hinge and other dating platforms have taken no steps to ensure the safety of the product they are selling, matching unsuspecting women to known predators without pause or concern.”Match Group didn’t make it easy for the Denver prosecutors to convict Matthews. A search warrant was issued for Hinge in July 2023. Two months later, prosecutors were still empty-handed – with the judge in the case asking at a hearing whether he needed to start “dragging people in to get stuff done”. It wasn’t until February 2024 that the Denver district attorney’s office said they had finally received documents returned by Match Group.Matthews will likely never leave prison. Match Group executives currently face no charges. But the company knew about Matthews, and it knows about thousands of other abusive users. It has the data that could help people avoid dangerous situations, but it hasn’t shared it, leaving millions of people in the dark.Lawmakers around the world are starting to ask for answers from the most powerful force in modern dating. In June, Colorado passed a law, triggered by the Matthews case, that forces dating-app companies to tell the state attorney generalwhich safety measures they are taking to protect users. Although the law leaves room for the possibility of additional transparency in the future, it does not currently require the company to tell the state, or the public, how many people are raped or assaulted after using its platform. In the US, the surface has only been scratched. In most states, there’s little that requires Match Group to share information with users – or with Congress.The reality is that if Stephen Matthews were released today, he could get right back on a dating app. Match Group knows this – and now so do you.Stephanie Wolf contributed reporting. Statistical journalist Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett ledthe Markup’s testing of Match Group apps.Methodology: How we tested Match Group’s dating appsThe Markup created more than 50 accounts across Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish to test how Match Group treats reports of sexual assault and whether users banned from Tinder after a reported sexual assault could return to Match Group apps by creating new accounts. We conducted experiments in April and May of 2024 and again in January and February of 2025. The results were similar across both rounds of testing.To start, the Markup tested whether and how quickly Tinder would ban users who had been reported for in-person behavior. We found that Tinder consistently banned reported users within two days of receiving a report.Next, we tested whether a banned Tinder user could use their exact same basic account information to sign up for other Match Group dating apps: Hinge, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish. Hinge and OKCupid prevented us from creating accounts, but Plenty of Fish allowed us to create new accounts. Within 48 hours, the Plenty of Fish accounts were taken down.Our next tests focused on identifying what type of changes would allow banned users to rejoin Tinder or to create new accounts on other Match Group apps. To simulate what a typical user would try, the Markup utilized online guides and forums to identify commonly suggested techniques to get around a ban from a Match Group app.We then tried a combination of these suggestions, especially those that self-identified banned users claimed to have had success with. Across several rounds of testing, we found multiple ways to successfully create new Match Group accounts that bypassed the ban. Each method involved simple changes in how we signed up and the information we provided during the process.When attempting to rejoin or to create a new account on another Match Group app, we used the normal sign-up processes users go through and used the same phone number as the original banned account. During multiple tests, we successfully created new accounts without needing to change the user’s name, birthday or profile photos.The Markup did not test any methods that required significant technical knowledge and utilized only information that would be easily accessible to someone who did a cursory search of how to get around a ban. For example, the Markup did not test whether changing a profile photo’s metadata could alter the results. The Markup’s test accounts created for these experiments purposefully did not like, match with or message any real Match Group users.Natasha Uzcátegui-LiggettInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

A new one every week. Before, you might see between zero and 10 to a dozen in an average year.”It is an effort that has been supported by the building of new illegal roads which, in the area east of Tko’a, have been bulldozed into the hills. “The Bedouin here are the weakest and most vulnerable of the Palestinian communities and they are being displaced as communities and made homeless,” Mizrachi said.A short drive south brings you to Minya and a massive open landfill site on the edge of the desert hills where, a kilometre or so from the dump, Bedouin are still trying to remain on their land.Middle EastIn one small encampment, Jameel and Mujahid Shalalda have managed to hang on, despite a campaign of violence since a group of young extremist settlers arrived nearby in December.The shacks of the settlers known as the Flock of Abraham are visible in the near distance, their cars moving across a nearby hill.The Guardian is shown a video of recent attacks: settlers attempting to frighten the Bedouin flocks, setting fire to a building, stealing equipment and setting a dog on the Bedouin children.“There are two tribes here. We’ve been here for 52 years,” said Jameel. “The settlers arrived three months ago. Every day and every night we are afraid what they will do. There was another family here, but they were frightened into leaving. But we have nowhere else to go.“They’ve destroyed structures in our camp and even though we have been to the police they do nothing.”Yehuda Shaul of Ofek, the Israeli Centre for Public Affairs, said: “We are talking about thousands and thousands of dunums of land.” A dunum is equivalent to a quarter of an acre.“What’s happening around Tko’a is what is happening elsewhere,” said Shaul. “New areas being cleansed by settler violence.”Shaul said that in the 12 months before 7 October 2023 “we saw something like 100 Palestinians displaced” but in the months after the Hamas attack it was 1,400. He added that the acceleration of settler activity in the Tko’a area was being accommodated by the current Israeli political climate.“Three and a half years ago there were around 240,000 dunums Palestinians could not access because of settler violence,” he said. “Today that figure is close to 800,000. That’s 12% of the West Bank.”What was important now, Shaul said, was how Israeli settlers who had long behaved with impunity in Area C were now shifting their tactics to new parts of the West Bank with the aim of completely fragmenting the territory intended for a future Palestinian state.“Now the settlers have become increasingly emboldened, the language being used is about the ‘battle over open space’, avoiding talking about Area B or C,” he said. “Because saying that, in their view, reinforces the Oslo paradigm which they reject.“It’s now not good enough that Palestinians are contained in Areas A and B. Now the goal is that they must be contained in the built-up areas. The open spaces – they say – are ours. They are trying to put the last nail in the coffin [of a meaningful Palestinian state.]”Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

A short driving distance away from the borders of Luxembourg, Belgium, France and the Netherlands, Trier is often described as being “in the heart of Europe”.“When I walk the dog,” Gregor said, “I see old people looking for food in rubbish bins. It hurts me. Twenty years ago, I never saw anything like this.”Gregor, who has two sons in their 20s, worked in the financial industry for about 40 years until he lost his job last summer. He is looking for a new job, but in Luxembourg, not Germany, because “the pension system is much more attractive there, the roads are better, public transport is free”.He will be among millions of Germans heading to the polls on 23 February to vote in a snap general election, after the coalition of the Social Democrats (SDP), Free Democratic party (FDP) and Greenscollapsed in November.Gregor was one of hundreds of citizens who shared with the Guardian how they felt about the chaotic political and economic situation in Europe’s largest economy.View image in fullscreenGerman interior minister Nancy Faeser on a visit to the Miniatur Wunderland model railway attraction in Hamburg on Wednesday.Photograph: Gregor Fischer/EPAWhile most people agreed Germany’s malaise was primarily to be blamed on a lack of sorely needed investment in the country’s ailing transport, energy, housing, education and health infrastructure, opinions on how such investments should be financed diverged enormously.Having supported left-leaning parties in the past, Gregor will likely vote for the liberal but fiscally conservative FDP – the party many voters blame for the coalition government’s downfall, as its leadership refused to embrace more public borrowing in accordance with the German “debt brake”, enshrined in Germany’s constitution after the 2008 global financial crisis.The controversial law prohibited the federal government from running more than a very modest budget deficit after 2016, and has required the country’s state governments to balance their budgets since 2020.“You can see that we lost prosperity over the last decade when you travel in Germany, when you look at the infrastructure,” Gregor said. “Since last summer’s [Euro 2024] football tournament, everyone knows that we have aproblem with our trains. They are unreliable. When I was younger, trains were punctual, efficient, affordable. Then there is our inability to adapt our economy, fix our productivity problem and regain our [competitive edge]. [The former chancellor Angela] Merkel has not capitalised on the good years. We haven’t invested enough, and this is the result.”What we need to do is: work longer, work harderLike various other people from states in what used to beWest Germany, Gregor opposes the funding of new investment with more public debt.“Higher European and German debt will not solve our problems. We have to strengthen our economy, stabilise our society, and to do that we have to introduce reforms, for instance to our unemployment welfare system,” he said.“A lot of people want to work part-time, but then they will not have enough for their pensions.What we need to do is: work longer, work harder.”During the years of Merkel’s chancellorship – a period widely considered synonymous with economic success, security and political stability for the most part – large swathes of German society, Gregor feels, moved further to the left as Merkel had been increasingly embracing centre-left ideas, which included her decisions to abandon nuclear power, to expand the welfare state and to open the borders to more than a million asylum seekers at the height of the European refugee crisis in 2015.Now thatcheap gas from Russiahas dried up and German industry has suffered, resulting in Germanyfacing a third consecutive year of recession, the mood has shifted in many parts of the country.Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s SPD, ​the traditional centre-left force, has collapsed to just over 15% in the polls. The centre-right CDU/CSU alliance is comfortably in the lead with about 30%, while the anti-immigration, Eurosceptic, far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has risen to more than 20%, making it the second strongest party.Although Gregor worries about immigration and “open borders” and feels Germany is “importing problems”, he fears the AfD is “going to destroy our society”.View image in fullscreenAnti-AfD protesters in Heidenheim, Germany, on Sunday.Photograph: Angelika Warmuth/Reuters“There is a radicalisation on the left and right,” he said. “Die AfD and [far-left] BSW [Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance] are pro-Putin, fighting against democracy, and against Europe. [It’s because] we have severe problems, with the war in Ukraine, and a weak economy.”While Gregor hopes parties from the political centre will eventually act, he believes politicians and voters, in particularly the western part of Germany, are still too comfortable to address the issues driving other voters to political extremes. “The pain,” he said, “isn’t sharp enough yet.”On the other side of the country, in Dresden, in the former East German state of Saxony – where the AfD has celebrated staggering electoral victories for years – lives 32-year-old Franziska Roeber, a university research associate.“The collapse of the coalition brings a lot of uncertainty with it,” she said. “Especially with conservative parties becoming more conservative and rightwing parties gaining more traction, the coalition was – at least on the surface – some kind of political bulwark against those ideas. Now that’s gone.”Roeber will likely vote for the main far-left party, Die Linke, or the Greens, citinghealthcare, the climate crisis, social benefits and increased support for students as the issues that will decide her vote.She was, however, among many who predicted the “unconvincing” performance of Scholz’s administration, marred by infighting, would pave the way for the CDU/CSU’s return to power.I think this is a real turning point in Germany and very, very scary“Many people think [the SPD and the Greens] betrayed their values, but they’ve also pushed through legislation that wasn’t well received by [other parts of] the population, such as the Heating Act, which phases out oil heating systems that a lot of people still use,” Roeber said, adding the policy had “hit many people really hard”, and cost her own parents about €15,000 (£12,500) for the installation of a new gas heating system.Many voters were turning to the conservatives “out of sheer frustration”, she said, while other communities, especially in rural areas of eastern Germany, felt “forgotten and left in the dust” by German politics, turning to the AfD in protest. “I think this is a real turning point in Germany. The thought that a majority of the population might go for rightwing parties is really, really scary.”Lyn Faltin, 39, from Munich,who describes herself as working class,was among many who expressed dismay over the Greens’ and SPD’s performance while in power and pointed to an identity crisis among leftwing parties.“I will vote Green, as I always do, but with much less enthusiasm than ever before,” she said. “I wish the Greens and SPD would fight for what they are supposed to fight for, the planet and the working class, invest in education, but they don’t do that. They are so very focused on not upsetting anyone that they lost all courage to bring change. Climate change is somehow not an issue in the campaign. It’s all about limiting immigration, which is not a problem.”While scores of people expressed concern about increasingly rightwing rhetoric regarding immigration in German politics, even fromScholz himself, others welcomed this shift, with a number of people pointing to recent terrorist attacks such as themass stabbingby a Syrian asylum seeker in the western city of Solingen last summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many people don’t want solutions, they want a return to the old status quo of blissful ignorance, but the prospect ofFriedrich Merz’s almost-certain chancellorship, as a figurehead of regression, is hardly inspiring.”View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz on the campaign trail this week.Photograph: Michael Kappeler/APLucia, 44, an environmental project manager from Frankfurt, said: “As the government is self-obsessed with embarrassing internal power struggles, I fear that the German people are looking for strong ‘father figures’ and turn to the AfD for guidance. As a member of the small German POC [people of colour] community, I literally feel people’s hatred towards foreigners growing.”Over the past two years, Lucia was attacked three times by strangers in the street, she said, and a Turkish friend was pushed off her bicycle. “Frankfurt is the city of money, very international. But I have a close friend, a hairdresser. People tell her what they feel. And for the past two years, she’s been saying the rightwing parties are getting stronger, because people are afraid.’”There is a pervading sense of ‘nothing works’Many people agreed the debt brake was one of the main barriers for the government to properly address the numerous issues the country is facing, including the state of Germany’s military.Various people cited security fears amid global geopolitical turmoil as a main reason why they wanted the government to ignore constitutional borrowing constraints going forward, such as Julian, 36, a researcher for the Catholic church from Bavaria.Among the issues that were most important to him were “the promised restrengthening of the armed forces”, “a forceful defence of Ukraine”, “a strong Europe” and “the need to address climate change”. He was planning to vote Greens, he said, as they had repeatedly called for the removal of the debt brake.“What will happen to Europe if Ukraine should fall?” he asked. “There is a pervading sense of ‘nothing works’ in the public discourse here. We are stifled by nimbyism and our own bureaucracy. Our tech industry is a joke, as are our armed forces. Inflation runs rampant and now even the car manufacturers are hitting very troubled waters.”Many others commented on the dire outlook of the German automotive industry, a major economic pillar..“TheGerman carmakers’ arrogance and failureto make necessary changes is quite similar to that of Detroit in the US in the 70s,” said Ania Bothe, an architect from Berlin and usually an SPD voter, who was finding it “difficult” to decide how to vote this time. “Back then, [Detroit automakers] wanted to keep producing their huge US limousines, but the rest of the world did not want to buy these any longer.”Various people disagreed that it was a lack of investment in future-facing energy and new technology that was crippling the German economy, and blamedcostly environmental and energy policiesby the “elitist” Greens for the economic downturn instead.I will vote AfD, to send a warning shotDavid, a retired airline pilotand previously a CDU voter, from a small Bavarian town, held the Greens’ “ideology” responsible for “the most dysfunctional, incompetent government” he felt he had ever lived under.“I will be voting for the AfD,” he said. “I’d like to send a warning shot with my small vote, because I want the other parties to engage with some of their ideas.” While there was a “fairly extreme element of the party”, David said – for example he did not agree with its stance on Russia – its opposition to immigration appealed to him.David said food prices were high, wages were stagnant, the healthcare system was failing, and unregulated immigration was “out of control”. “I have the feeling that the politicians don’t understand the citizens, [and] how frustrated they are, like me. I wouldn’t vote for Trump, but I don’t think it’s wrong to say: Germany first.”Angelika Surkamer, a 59-year-old travel manager from the picturesque city of Paderborn in North Rhine-Westphalia, is voting Green for the first time as she agrees with the party’s energy policies and considers the climate crisis “the major problem”.She said: “Things were not going well under Scholz, but will not get any better under Merz. I am afraid that we as a nation will get weaker, making the EU weaker, and this with an erratic US government on one side and Putin on the other. Nobody will care about climate or ecological issues, ignoring the signs of our time. Personally, I feel more insecure than ever.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)Olaf ScholzThe far rightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In one case, electricity transformers already delivered had to be put into storage because of the stop-work order, leaving a community without reliable electricity.“It was a shock that USAid was frozen for helping those communities that the US had helped to survive. [Before], US help was omnipresent,” said Mirza Dinnayi, a prominent Yazidi human rights activists who runs the House of Co-Existence (HOC) multicultural community center in Sinjar.He said that USAid, which provided the vast majority of humanitarian funding to the area, had been was a “pillar of stabilisation and normalisation”.“They had a crucial role in his first administration for recognising the Yazidi genocide and supporting US aid to helpIraq,” said Dinnayi. “Minority rights and religious freedoms were supported in the first administration. I’m wondering why the second administration is not aware about that.”View image in fullscreenYazidis women hold pictures of their missing relatives on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the genocide.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianCharities supporting Christian minorities, such as Catholic Relief Services (CRS), have also been directly affected by the work stoppage, including their programs in Iraq’s Nineveh Plains area and among Christian communities, according to people familiar with their work in the area. CRS, a top recipient of funds from USAid, is facing up to 50% layoffs this year and has begun shutting down programs that account for half of the organization’s $1.5bn budget, according to anemail obtained by the National Catholic Reporter.“I see a lot of harm in the abrupt way that this assistance has stopped,” said a former USAid employee in Iraq.Meanwhile in Washington, a coterie of conservatives – many with former ties to Pence and USAid – have now allied with Elon Musk’s effort to take down the agency.One of them is Max Primorac, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation’s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, who authoredProject 2025’s chapter on USAid recommending a blueprint to downsize the agency. He isset to testifybefore the House foreign affairs committee on Thursday at a hearing titled the “USAid betrayal”.Primorac did not respond to a request for an interview sent through the Heritage Foundation.View image in fullscreenYazidi people head towards the Syrian border in 2014.Photograph: Rodi Said/ReutersPrimorac is one of a number of prominent conservatives who supported Pence’s initiative to support religious minorities but have now gone on record backing the aid freeze. Others include Pence himself, Vice-President JD Vance, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and Pete Marocco, the Trump ally and USAid skeptic who nonethelessprotected funding to religious initiatives under Pence. Marocco even reportedly led operations with his Patriot Group International to exfiltrate Yazidis in 2016.From late 2018 to early 2019, Primorac traveled to Erbil and northern Iraq as Pence’s special envoy, “overseeing a multi-agency genocide recovery effort to assist religious minority returns”, according to his current biography on the Heritage Foundation’s website.Colleagues said he arrived with a dim view of USAid but that he came to support at least some of the efforts the agency was making in the field.Trump ally Peter Marocco behind evisceration of USAid: ‘He’s a destroyer’Read more“He had a couple of visits to areas where we worked and I think that changed him a bit in a positive way,” said a USAid employee.Now, the person said, “for someone who really believed in his mission supporting religious minorities, he does not seem to be paying attention or advocating for a way forward.”Primorac later boasted that he had led a “$400m counter-genocide program … to spur the return of Iraqi Christians to their ancient homeland” and excoriated the Biden administration for turning its back on Iraq’s “traumatised” Christians.“Under the Trump administration, I led acounter-genocideprogram in Iraq to help Christian and Yazidi victims recover fromIS’s campaign of extermination,” he wrote in another article for Newsweek. “We provided these traumatized religious minorities with humanitarian aid, [and] psycho-social help.”Now he has become one of the leading voices calling for the agency’s dissolution, authoring a recent Fox News editorial “how USAid went woke and destroyed itself”. An advance copy of his testimony to the House set for Thursday did not reference his work in Iraq.Former colleagues say they share some of Primorac’s criticisms of USAid but were perplexed by his full-scale repudiation of their work, the programs he previously cooperated with.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community gather for humanitarian aid at the Syria-Iraq border in 2014.Photograph: Khalid Mohammed/AP“If we are going to achieve meaningful reform in the foreign assistance system, we need honest dialogue, and it’s important for me to acknowledge that I share some of his critiques about USAid,” said a person who leads a major USAid-funded project in Iraq.“I only wish that [Primorac] would approach the conversation in a similar way, acknowledging all of the great work that USAid has achieved – especially in Iraq.”The change reflects how top Republicans are hedging their views under the Trump administration and a campaign led by Musk to eviscerate the agency, which he has called “criminal” and “corrupt”.Current and former USAid members in the field said that they have heard nothing from their former supporters in the US, and have in effect been cut out of systems that would give crucial information on budgets and projects meant to support communities.“It’s quite puzzling, to be honest,” said one former USAid employee in Iraq.Meanwhile, the onslaught in Washington has continued. At the International Religious Freedom Summit last week, Vance denounced USAid for promoting “atheism” while boasting of “bringing relief to Yazidis, Christians and other faith communities facing genocidal terror from Isis” in the past.“It was perplexing to hear the vice-president champion these initiatives while, at the same time, funds for efforts like these are literally being turned off,”wrote Adam Nicholas Phillips, the lead administration official at USAid working on faith-based partnerships during the Biden administration.“Maybe the attacks on USAid are just misinformed and will be righted. Maybe there is a bold plan to invest in foreign assistance. I take administration officials at their word and I’m praying these decisions are reversed with haste.”Explore more on these topicsIraqUSAidMike PenceSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaIslamic StateUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

By the time he reached hospital, snake venom had already started breaking down his skin and muscle. The flesh around the bite was necrotising, or dying.The only treatment to stop the damage was antivenom and a vial was given to Kamidikolo, 60, a handyman fromLwanga, southernUganda. But it was too late to stop the damage to the finger and arm where he was bitten.In sub-SaharanAfrica, patients face a “wild west” of antivenoms, with many badly made and poorly regulated in an area where there is a shortage of reliable medicine, experts say. Some antivenoms are about as useful as injecting water.The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) bought samples of antivenoms in three countries and had them tested, and found that more than 70 vials of some of the antivenoms would be needed to treat some bites effectively.One antivenom company has been accused of fraudulent research. Some antivenoms made to treat Indian snakebites end up in African where they do not work – a trade that experts called unethical.View image in fullscreenThea Litscha-Koen, founder of the Eswatini Antivenom Foundation.Photograph: Claudia Ramos/TBIJA major issue for doctors, researchers and patients is that antivenom is not held to the same regulations that apply to many other drugs.The first snakebite antivenom was made in the mid-1890s and the method has changed little since: snakes are “milked” for their venom, which is injected into horses or sheep and the antibodies that their immune systems then produce are extracted via the animals’ blood.There areno requirementsin sub-Saharan Africa for antivenoms to be tested in clinical human trials to prove they are safe or effective.“It’s a cowboy show out there,” says Thea Litscha-Koen, who founded the Eswatini Antivenom Foundation, which raises funds to treat victims. “Some of them are selling stuff that, honestly, you may as well just pour down the drain.”A bite from a venomous snake can kill or cause life-changing injuries. “It can be horrific,” says Litscha-Koen, “I will send you pictures that make your eyes water.”Some snakes have “cytotoxic” venom, which damages and kills cells. Victims say it feels as if you are being injected with acid. A cytotoxic wound can cover the chest and arm, or an entire leg, and take months to heal, Litscha-Koen says.Other species, such as west Africa’s carpet viper, stop blood from clotting. Then there is the black mamba, whose neurotoxic venom strangles nerve signals from the brain and shuts down a human body.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that5.4 million people are bittenby snakes each year, causing between 80,000 and 140,000 deaths.In 2023, anestimated 20,000 peopledied from snakebites in sub-Saharan Africa. In the same year in Australia, where antivenom is of a high quality and free, two people died.View image in fullscreenA black mamba, a highly venomous African snake, has a neurotoxic venom that shuts down a human body.Photograph: Survivalphotos/Alamy“It’s a poor man’s disease,” Litscha-Koen says. “That’s the cruel truth.” Victims typically live in remote, often rural areas, in south Asia and Africa. Farmers and children are most at risk and a snakebite usually has devastating economic consequences for entire families.Six months on, Kamidikolo, who had a skin graft on the arm where he was bitten, still relies on painkillers and sleeping pills. The father of five children under 10, who made his living from fixing, building and digging, can no longer work and so his children no longer go to school.With an effective dose of antivenom, properly administered, the chances of survival and recovery are very high. But for people like Kamidikolo, the odds are against them.On the third floor of a glass-panelled office block in Valencia, Spain, Prof Juan Calvete runs a laboratory analysing venoms and antivenoms. He holds a vial in his hand, peering at the label. The antivenom was bought in east Africa for the TBIJ’s investigation, and lists the venom of Indian snakes it could be used to treat. The label is partly written in Bengali with the price in Indian rupees.You can do two things [after the wrong antivenom]: say goodbye to your mother and find an ice-cream you like because it will be the last thing you eatProf Juan CalveteVenom’s effects vary from species to species, and even within the same species depending on where the serpent lives and what it eats. An antivenom formulated to work in one region won’t necessarily be effective somewhere else.Calvete explains what would happen if you were bitten by a highly venomous African snake such as a black mamba and given an antivenom for Indian snakebites, such as the one he is holding.“You can do two things,” he says. “One, is to take the phone and say goodbye to your mother. And the other, if you have an ice-cream shop nearby and you find the flavour that you like, take it. Because it will be the last thing that you eat.”Calvete’s lab at the Valencia Institute of Biomedicine is the sole provider of official assessments on antivenom quality for the WHO.View image in fullscreenProf Juan Calvete runs a laboratory at the Valencia Institute of Biomedicine analysing venoms and antivenoms.Photograph: Paul Eccles/TBIJFor the TBIJ’s investigation, Calvete tested two more Indian antivenoms bought in Uganda and Nigeria – both had low capacity to work against sub-Saharan African snake venom.“Giving a patient this antivenom will be almost like injecting distilled water in the body,” he says.Calvete’s team tested five antivenoms bought in Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda. Each came as a fine powder, which was weighed and diluted to examine ingredients. The team tested how well each product would bind to the venoms of widely found African snakes: the puff adder, black-necked spitting cobra, black mamba and the west African carpet viper. The binding capacity of an antivenom shows how much of the venom it will “stick” to per unit. The first step in neutralising the toxins in the venom is for the antivenom to bind to them. If it does not stick, it won’t work.Two of the antivenoms were manufactured for use in India not Africa, and showed a low capacity to work against the venom of sub-Saharan African snakes. Meanwhile, another antivenom was found to contain a tenth of the active ingredient of its competitors. The two other antivenoms made for sub-Saharan Africa performed better, although Calvete noted that even the best antivenoms available in the region “could and should be better”.Dr David Williams, a snakebite expert at the WHO, said even those ordering in antivenoms for national health ministries don’t always understand how they work.“Nobody tells them what species of snake they are meant to be looking for,” he says. “They buy the cheapest product they can possibly find. It’s not until it ends up in the doctor’s hands that somebody works out that it is not for the snakes that come from our country.”View image in fullscreenA black spitting cobra. An antivenom intended for one snake species may not work on the venom from another snake.Photograph: imageBroker.com/AlamyAntivenoms don’t have to be labelled specifying how much key ingredient is in each vial. There are no legal grounds on which to challenge manufacturers’ claims about the bites they can treat and dosage required.Calvete described the current regulations as a tragedy: “You need to change the rules.”The implications for patients are severe. “Time is life,” says Calvete. “The probability that you get out of the hospital with all your limbs is much higher if you don’t have to be treated with vial after vial.”Dr Abdul-Subulr Yakubu leads the cardiology unit at Ghana’s Tamale teaching hospital, but regularly treats snakebites. He often finds himself having to give a patient several times the recommended dose of antivenoms.“We are not sure if we have to give large volumes because it’s not very effective,” Yakubu says. After all, there are many other factors that can complicate treating a snakebite. Many snakebite patients who go to hospital have been to local healers first, delaying their treatment and sometimes introducing infections. Some come in too late for antivenom to work. Others don’t know what kind of snake has bitten them, making it harder to give the best treatment.There are other issues too – shortages of medication increases the death toll from snakebites across Africa. Dr Nicholas Amani Hamman, medical director of Nigeria’s Snakebite hospital and research centre recalls watching a four-year-old boy die last year, while waiting for a second dose of antivenom that didn’t arrive in time.A few hours’ drive north, Prof Abdulrazaq Habib at the Nigerian Snakebite Research and Intervention Centre, knows that when antivenom is out of stock and he writes a prescription for patients to take to a pharmacy, it is a gamble.View image in fullscreenA snake is ‘milked’ for venom at Watamu Snake Farm in Kenya. Experts believe more high-quality local antivenoms should be manufactured in Africa.Photograph: Paul Eccles/TBIJHe says a patient might have to “go back to his village and then sell a goat, or a sheep” to afford treatment. Even then, there is no guarantee they’ll get the right one. Habib has seen everything from genuine medicines that don’t work for the snakes in the region, to fake products, to asthma medication sold as antivenom because the bottles look similar.A reporter sent to a pharmacy in north-western Nigeria was offered antivenoms suitable for Indian snakes and a rabies vaccine. Neither would have helped against a snakebite. Very little antivenom is manufactured in Africa. It’s estimated the continent receives as little as2.5% of the antivenomit needs. It depends on imports, and lax practices have thrived.Among tropical diseases, snakebites are the most neglected. Most countries in the world have agreed to a UN goal of halving global mortality and disability from snakebites by 2030. However, in the past five years snakebites have received $83m in funding for research and development, compared with$1.65bnin similar funding for Ebola, which has killed far fewer people.Biting back: the clinic treating snakebite victims in Guinea – in picturesRead moreBut there are promising developments. Eswatini has managed to secure funding to produce an antivenom for local snakes. During the most recent snakebite season from September 2023 to May 2024, Eswatini recorded no deaths for the first time in its history.Habib believes there is enormous potential to make antivenom in Africa. Producing high-quality local antivenoms, he says, should be the aim. Governments need to step up, he says, pointing to poor planning that led to antivenom shortages in Nigeria at the peak of snakebite season.“I’m not saying it’s easy, but doing nothing is not an option.”This is an edited version of an investigation by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism.

Photograph: Lionel Flusin/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesInspired by Che Guevara, Jean Ziegler has spent the past 60 years exposing how Switzerland enabled global wrongdoing. His enemies accuse him of treasonByAtossa Araxia AbrahamianThu 13 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 08.33 ESTShareIn early 1964, Jean Ziegler, a young Swiss politician, received a phone call from a man claiming to represent Ernesto “Che” Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary and minister of industry. Che would be in Geneva in March for a UN conference on trade policy, and some comrades had suggested Jean might be his chauffeur during his stay. Was Ziegler available for the gig?Today, in his tenth decade of life, Ziegler is Switzerland’s most notorious public intellectual. That’s because, over the course of writing about 30 books, serving for close to three decades in the Swiss parliament, and relentlessly crusading for leftwing causes in his free time, Ziegler has made a career of unsparing criticism of his home country and its outsize influence on the rest of the world. In the 1960s, though, he was just another eager young leftist, waiting for his chance to change the world.Ziegler, like Che, was born into a family of upper-middle-class professionals. And, like Che’s, his travels around the world had radicalised him against what he perceived to be a capitalist, imperialist and racist system. Everywhere he went, he saw its ravages: in the Belgian Congo, whose hungry children haunted him long after he went home; in Algeria’s bloody wars of independence against the colonial French; and in annexed Cyprus, where the British had deprived citizens of their right to self-determination for decades.Ziegler heard the echoes of oppression closer to home, too, in the deracinated commodity exchanges through which speculators bet on the price of food and fuel; and in the bank vaults mere steps from his home, where kleptocrats siphoned away their countries’ natural resources.For centuries, the Swiss had prided themselves on keeping blood and money apart: of keeping its bank vaults isolated from the upheavals of the outside world. In Ziegler, they spawned an iconoclastic figure who forced them to reckon with the moral cost.“Blood may not run down the walls of the UBS headquarters,” he told me one afternoon in June 2021. “But it’s as if it did: the relative wellbeing of Swiss people is financed by death, fear and famine. This is Ali Baba’s cave: the world’s haven. That’s unique to Switzerland.”I always had a hunch that there was something strange about the place where I grew up, the Swiss city of Geneva, though its location doesn’t tell the whole story. Geneva hosts the United Nations, the World Health Organization and hundreds more international organisations and NGOs, which employ thousands of diplomats, consuls, expatriate workers and their families. There are more multinational companies there than I can count. Nearly half of Geneva’s population has a non-Swiss nationality. Without outsiders, the city would be nothing.I am, and will always be, a part of this world apart – a place defined by a certain placelessness. I went to international schools, where the history we were taught had little to do with the battles that had been fought steps from the playground. My parents’ jobs at the UN – my father was an economist at the organisation’s Conference on Trade and Development, and my mother, a conference interpreter for its secretariat – compounded the feeling of being a little elsewhere. My classmates seemed to move every few years, which made it feel like I was always moving, too, without my ever actually leaving.But there was another, less obvious reason for my unease with Geneva. It had to do with the rules: who made them, who followed them, and the places and people to whom they didn’t apply. So much of Geneva’s wealth comes from that spectral economy it plays ghostly host to, swaddled in security, neutrality, secrecy laws and tax exemptions.The canton of Geneva has only about half a million residents, with barely 200,000 living in the city proper, but more than one-third of the world’s grain is traded from desks here. More than half the bags of coffee in the world pass “through” Switzerland, most of them via firms in and around Geneva, in much the same fashion. The country didn’t get its first Starbucks until 2001; a few months later, the company began purchasing its coffee through a Swiss affiliate.Geneva has long been a hub for oil – if you can call it a hub when the barrels never actually turn up there. Until a few years ago, between 50% and 60% of Russian crude was traded from Switzerland, mostly Geneva, according to the research nonprofit Public Eye. When the Swiss parliament reluctantly voted to join the EU’s sanctions regime against Russia after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, some of that business decamped to Dubai.Switzerland is landlocked. That is no impediment to its being home to some of the biggest shipping companies in the world, which charter and manage vessels from Geneva while shrouding their beneficial (de facto) owners in layers of corporate secrecy. This way of positioning itself in the world is Geneva’s greatest contribution to the way we all live now: in an age of exceptions, in which the where and when don’t matter as much as who, how much and why. It’s a world where wealth travels in abstract form: numbers on a screen, trades on a terminal. It’s a world in which borders are drawn not just around places but also around people and things.Ziegler saw this early and exposed it often, risking his livelihood (and certainly his popularity with his compatriots) relentlessly.Imet Ziegler at his home in the small village of Russin, a few miles outside Geneva. He was wearing grey sweatpants and a stained white shirt when he greeted me at the door, and offered me whisky, more whisky and wine before conceding to pour me a glass of water while I waited on an upholstered yellow couch by the terrace door. The house was spacious and unfussy. It hung over a steep vineyard with a view of the lake. Every surface in the living room was piled with books, potted flowers or photographs of his family. “I hope you don’t mind that I’m barefoot,” he said. “I took a tumble recently,” he added, pointing to his bandaged forehead, “and it’s more comfortable this way.”Ziegler began his political life as a conservative; he was an active member of a student group formed in 1819 to promote Swiss national unity. He moved to Berne to read law, and then studied sociology in Paris at the Sorbonne in the mid-1950s. Between lectures, Ziegler befriended Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, and over the course of smoke-filled, wine-drenched evenings in Sartre’s mother’s flat the couple turned him on to Marxism and encouraged him to report on the Algerian war for their magazine, Les Temps Modernes.De Beauvoir took it upon herself to edit Ziegler’s awkward Swiss-German-French into more polished and literary prose. She also urged him to ditch his given name, Hans, and become Jean, which she judged a more dignified byline. It was Jean that Ziegler went by when he joined the French Communist party, and as Jean that he was expelled over his support for Algerian independence. But it was as Hans that he provided material support to the causes he loved: carrying suitcases of cash over the French-Swiss border for the Front de Libération National to deposit in Geneva, and “losing” his passport (with the aim of lending it to a comrade) a few too many times to pass himself off as innocently absent-minded.In 1961, Ziegler responded to a classified ad seeking French speakers to accompany a British civil servant on a mission to what is today the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country had just become independent, but a coup backed by Belgium (which wanted to keep mining concessions) and the United States (which wanted to squash communism) deposed the elected president, Patrice Lumumba, and installed Mobutu Sese Seko in his stead. Mobutu was your archetypal kleptocrat: a ruthless, fiercely anti-communist megalomaniac hellbent on enriching himself and his cronies while the Congolese people suffered. He nationalised industry but put the country’s resources in the hands of friends and family, leaving ordinary citizens little to show for their country’s vast mineral wealth.View image in fullscreenCongolese troops capturing prisoners in 1964.Photograph: APZiegler was staying in a gated hotel in what is now Kinshasa, ensconced behind high walls snared with barbed wire, where every day hungry local children would gather and beg for leftover food. One day, Ziegler watched as the compound’s guards violently dispersed the children and sent them away bruised and bleeding. It broke his heart to see them treated that way. His voice cracked as he recalled the incident as though it had happened just yesterday.When Ziegler learned that Mobutu had siphoned off unthinkable sums of money from his country and deposited them in Swiss banks, the political started to feel personal – intensely personal. “I saw children in terrible, terrible conditions there,” he told me. “And knowing that Mobutu, who came to Geneva with this blood money that caused so much death in his country, was enabled by the Swiss oligarchy – that’s what motivated me.”By the time Ziegler met Che and his associates in Geneva, in their berets and olive-green uniforms, he was all in. Over the next two weeks, he ingratiated himself with the Cubans, driving them to Mont Blanc, translating what Spanish he could, and making himself available at all hours of the day. The revolutionaries brought the jungle with them to the staid city, sleeping in shared rooms in hammocks, drinking, smoking and staying up all night arguing. Ziegler joined in, and on their last evening he gathered up the courage to ask Che to take him back to Cuba so he could join the revolution.It was a clear night, and from their room on the eighth floor of the Hotel InterContinental, they could see the lake, illuminated then as now with fluorescent signs for luxury watches.Che gestured out over the water. “Here is where you were born, and here lives the monster’s brain,” Ziegler remembers him saying. “It is here,” he continued, “that you must fight.” It was probably just a throwaway line intended to dissuade a scrawny dilettante from getting himself killed. But Ziegler took it to heart. He knew there was something about the way Switzerland operated that made it uniquely useful to the forces of capitalism: not as a lead actor, but as an enabler working from behind the scenes.Some years later, Ziegler would use the term “secondary imperialism” to define his country’s modus operandi. This was not the first-order French, British or, later, American imperialism, with boots on the ground and armies on call. It was a more discreet kind of influence that intervened in its wake: a cabal of multinational firms and financiers who kept poor countries dependent on western (mostly American) goods, guns and money.The Swiss enabled these practices by offering access to favourable regulations and financing, and a reputable, orderly and neutral business environment: good rules, good laws. It was, in a sense, the mercenary trade by another name. The Swiss weren’t sending bodies abroad to fight someone else’s war of conquest, as they had in centuries past. But, in Ziegler’s reading, they were providing a launching pad for a modern corollary. “Once I saw what was going on,” he told me, “I couldn’t not denounce it.”His book, Switzerland: The Awful Truth, was published in 1976. Ziegler’s thesis, which he stands by to this day, is that Switzerland’s role in the world is that of accomplice – handmaiden, of sorts – to capitalism.“In Switzerland, the handling of money has a quasi-sacramental character,” Ziegler wrote. “Holding money, accepting it, counting it, hoarding it, speculating and receiving, are all activities which, since the first influx of Protestant refugees to Geneva in the 16th century, have been invested with an almost metaphysical majesty.”Ziegler then laid into Swiss banks and pharmaceutical companies, trade groups and multinationals, implicating the firms and the individuals behind them in everything from drug trafficking to human rights abuses abroad. “It is hard to imagine a human activity that is not financed by a [financial institution] in Geneva, Zurich, Basel or Lugano,” he wrote.View image in fullscreenJean Ziegler speaks at a rally in Berne in 1971.Photograph: ullstein bild Dtl./ullstein bild/Getty ImagesThe transgressors included the banks that welcomed suitcases of cash from dictatorships in Portugal and the Dominican Republic; the real estate agencies that helped Gulf sheikhs and Guatemalan colonels buy lakeside apartments in which to hide; and subsidiaries of the American firms Dow Chemical and Honeywell, which oversaw the international sales of napalm and landmines.The claims Ziegler made in this and subsequent books landed him nine defamation lawsuits in five jurisdictions over the course of the following decades (Swiss defamation law is more liberal, for plaintiffs, than its US counterpart). All told, he has been assessed damages of 6.6m Swiss francs (CHF), equivalent to almost £5.8m, penalties that have essentially bankrupted him, at least on paper.Ziegler has done more than point fingers at morally unscrupulous industries. He identifies his country’s famed political neutrality as a massive money-making asset in itself, a structural advantage in commerce and diplomacy that allows the Swiss elite to create safe spaces for capital and capitalists to thrive, no matter where they come from or what they believe. From there, the Swiss sweeten the deal with special concessions that go beyond what its European neighbours might offer: today, that might include a tax deduction for research and development costs in the pharmaceutical industry; special warehouses that are designated as outside customs territory, where wealthy people can store high-value objects such as art and wine; a tendency not to hold firms based in Switzerland accountable for pollution and labour abuses abroad; and, of course, the country’s strict laws against disclosing bank information.Plenty of countries mobilise their capacities as recognised nation states – the ability to wage war (or not), collect taxes (or not), pass laws (or not) and police their borders (selectively) – as means to bring in money. But Ziegler’s argument has always been that his country punches far above its weight, to everyone’s detriment. That, he writes, makes it “a defensive association, not a nation state in the usual sense”.The result is that, while maintaining the facade of an ultra-populist, referendum-driven direct democracy, the Swiss government is utterly beholden to global capital. It is also remarkably nimble. When voters decided in a 2019 national referendum to overhaul their country’s tax system and do away with preferential tax rates for multinationals, individual cantons took matters into their own hands and cut taxes locally: in Basel, corporate tax rates fell from 20% to 13%, while Geneva’s tax increases were essentially symbolic, growing from a baseline of 11.6% to 13.9%.As Ziegler likes to put it: the Swiss have “fences” to render wealth untouchable. The word he employs is telling. In French, as in English,receleurand fence are double entendres that can refer either to a physical barrier or to a recipient of stolen goods. The fence is both the border and the banker, the moat and the middleman.View image in fullscreenZiegler in 1981.Photograph: ullstein bild Dtl./ullstein bild/Getty ImagesThe fence – not the cuckoo clock, not fondue, certainly not brotherly love – is the nation’s contribution to the world we live in. If you know where to look, you will see little Switzerlands anywhere you go.An enduring assumption about taxes in Switzerland (and its fellow tax havens) is that the country lowered rates in order to attract business. That narrative has it backward: in the early 20th century, France and Germany began to impose progressive income and inheritance taxes on their populations for the first time – taxing greater wealth at higher rates – while Switzerland did not. News got out through a deliberate advertising campaign targeting the rich: the University of Lausanne historian Sébastien Guex writes that the banks printed “brochures, circulars, personalised letters, and advertising in newspapers, and sent representatives who approached their clientele in person”. It worked: according to Guex, half Switzerland’s gross domestic product arrived in Swiss banks following these efforts.Switzerland adopted a strategy of active obstruction, whether by adopting federal policies that precluded negotiations with other governments that might have held tax cheats accountable, by letting the Swiss banks “self-regulate”, or simply by refusing to crack down on the practice. The Swiss also benefited from a federal system that encouraged cantons to compete not only with foreign entities but with one another – and to provide clients with plenty of options.In 1934, Switzerland adopted its now infamous bank secrecy legislation. The line you’re likely to hear about its origins – one that even Ziegler is wont to repeat – is that it was conceived to shield foreigners from persecution for taking money out of their home countries. Some German Jews, sensing trouble brewing, did so, and Germany had begun to punish such capital flight with the death penalty. But the historian Peter Hug discovered that this explanation was revisionist propaganda constructed in the 1960s by Credit Suisse. In fact, the secrecy law was the result of an existential scandal.In 1932, the French police were tipped off about a secret meeting in an apartment on the Champs-Élysées, during which the head of Basel’s commercial bank was giving tax advice – of an unquestionably shady variety – to members of French high society. It transpired that the Basel bank’s 2,000 or so tax-averse French clients included bishops, generals, newspaper publishers, a dozen senators, a minister, the wife of a famous perfumer and the industrialist Armand Peugeot. Their wealth, all of it undeclared, amounted to no less than one-fifth of Swiss GDP.The bankers returned hundreds of millions of francs to the French, realising that such incidents would cause clients to lose confidence and take their business elsewhere. Less than two years later, the Swiss parliament made disclosing the owner of a numbered account a federal crime, thus sealing their nascent banking industry from sight for the greater part of the next century. Under the new law, you didn’t need a victim to bring a criminal complaint; in the absence of a plaintiff, charges could be brought by the state itself.View image in fullscreenSafe-deposit boxes in a Union of Swiss Banks facility.Photograph: Pierre Vauthey/Sygma/Getty ImagesIn 2014, 47 of the world’s governments entered a deal requiring automatic exchanges of clients’ account information. Under international pressure, Switzerland finally joined in, but it had already won. Over the course of the 20th century, the country anticipated and accommodated the increasingly footloose nature of wealth by transforming itself from a (non)state into a kind of black hole straddling globalisation and regulation. The cash, gold, bonds and other securities that found their way to Berne or Geneva enjoyed the advantages of being both somewhere safe and nowhere visible at the same time. The fact that tax evasion – that is, deliberately making false declarations about wealth or income – is prosecuted in Switzerland as a civil, not a criminal, offence could not have hurt either. And as unrest spread throughout Europe, the Swiss bankers could always depend on their biggest commercial asset: their political neutrality.Switzerland’s wiles and neutral status meant that it was able to ride out the second world war with relatively few disruptions. But that calm came at a steep moral cost that Ziegler remembers first-hand and has spent much of his career coming to grips with. His book The Swiss, the Gold, and the Dead offers a damning portrait of the Swiss banking establishment’s complicity with the Nazis.There’s always a price to pay for breaking with national character. Ziegler is 90 years old, and he’s still paying. In 1990, he was sued by six different parties for allegedly defamatory statements in his book Switzerland Washes Whiter, in which he accused Swiss banks of taking money from drug dealers and other criminals.Ziegler wound up losing his parliamentary immunity – which shields elected officials from certain types of prosecution – and being ordered to pay hundreds of thousands of francs in fines. For years, security guards were stationed near his house. “The threats are very precise,” he told the Los Angeles Times. “They always say something like, ‘Yesterday your son was here, you were there.’ It’s a kind of psychological destabilisation.” Ziegler’s wife, Erica, an art historian, holds the deed to their house so that it can’t be taken from them, he told me, and his book royalties are still being garnished.In 1998, Ziegler was called to testify before the US Congress on the role of Swiss banks during the second world war. “The ordinary Swiss people were deeply hostile to the mass murderers in Berlin. They hated Adolf Hitler and refused any dealings whatsoever with him and his cronies,” he said. “Unfortunately, this was not the case for some of the members of the ruling class, namely the directors of the Swiss National Bank, board members of commercial banks and some members of the Swiss government.”For his remarks, a group of conservatives in Switzerland accused him of criminal treason, arguing that his “malicious lies, fabrications, calumny and boundless exaggerations” threatened state security. The charge claimed he was “provoking or assisting activities against the security of the state by foreign organisations or their agents”.It struck me that after a lifetime of observing the mechanics of capitalism, Ziegler still seemed spellbound by the ingenuity, cynicism and malevolence of its enablers. “The fact that this tiny country of only 42,000 sq km, of which only 60% is habitable, with a population of fewer than 10 million, is such a powerful offshore centre – that 27% of the world’s offshore fortunes are managed in or from Switzerland – it’s just astonishing,” he told me. His moral outrage seemed compounded with wonder. I could relate.I asked Ziegler if it had all been worth it, and if he felt he’d made a dent in the system he had spent so long fighting. After all, bank secrecy was not what it used to be; money laundering, while by no means eradicated, is at least now a criminal offence; and Swiss banks are on the defensive.The prominence of these types of stories is proof that leftwing activists like Ziegler have influenced public debates about justice, fairness and inequality, and that awareness of the globe’s hidden havens is growing. But it’s not yet clear what impact these campaigns will have on actual wealth inequality and on the world’s poor.Ziegler, for one, thinks his country will abide by the letter, but not the spirit, of the law.This is an edited extract fromThe Hidden Globe: How Wealth Hacks the World, published on 20 February by Picador.

After their meeting, Sharif said the two countries were in “complete agreement” on establishing a Russian base “and there are no obstacles”.The Red Sea is one of the world’s most strategically important waterways, connecting the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean. About 12% of global trade passes through it.Sudan first floated the idea of allowing Russia to have a naval facility on its coast in 2017 during a trip to Sochi by Omar al-Bashir, the then president, who was ousted in a 2019 coup. A deal was eventually signed in 2020 that reportedly permitted Russia to keep up to four navy ships, including nuclear-powered ones, inSudanfor a period of 25 years.At the time, a draft agreementsaidthe bases were for logistical purposes and were “defensive and not aimed against other countries”.After the meeting with Lavrov, Sharif said a new deal was not required as “there was a deal signed [in 2020] and there is no disagreement”, adding that it only had to be ratified by both sides.Sudan’s military and civilian leaders dragged their feet on moving ahead with the deal due to lingering differences over its terms. The civil war that started in April 2023 between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces further complicated relations between Russia and Sudan, as the Russian-backed Wagner group threw its weight behind the RSF while the Kremlin appeared to back the Sudanese army.“Russia was playing both sides,” said Samuel Ramani, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank and the author of a book on Moscow’s engagements with Africa. Since thedeathof Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner mercenary group’s leader, the Kremlin had “incrementally” deepened ties with the Sudanese army, Ramani added.Last April, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Mikhail Bogdanov, visited Sudan and pledged “uncapped” support for its army. Russia has also backed Sudan at the UN security council, where it vetoed a resolution calling for a ceasefire for humanitarian reasons, a move the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy,calleda disgrace.3:08‘Shame on Putin’: David Lammy condemns Russia’s UN veto on Sudan ceasefire resolution – videoSudan’s army has won a string of battles against the RSF in recent months and isincreasingly confidentof a decisive victory over the paramilitary group, whose leaders the US has accused of genocide. In January the US imposed sanctions on Sudan’s army leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, for “choosing war over good-faith negotiation”.Aid organisations have said Sudan is the scene of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with the largest internally displaced population and fears thatfaminehas broken out in parts of the country.The announcement comes weeks after Moscow’s ally in the Middle East, Bashar al-Assad, was overthrown in an armed rebellion in Syria, casting doubt on the future of Russia’s Tartus naval base in the eastern Mediterranean.Explore more on these topicsRussiaSudanAfricaEuropeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

How drought and a youth exodus threaten Mexico’s prized cocoaRead moreThe decline has resulted in an increase in the price of cocoa, which is produced from the beans of the cacao tree and is the main ingredient in chocolate.A new report found that “climate change, due primarily to burning oil, coal and methane gas, is causing hotter temperatures to become more frequent” in places such as theIvory Coast, Ghana, Cameroon and Nigeria.The study, by the independent research groupClimate Central, found the trend was particularly marked in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the two biggest cacao producers.Using data from 44 cacao-producing areas in west Africa and computer models, the researchers compared today’s temperatures with a counterfactual of a world not affected by global heating.The researchers looked at the likelihood of these regions facing temperatures in excess of 32C (89.6 F) – above levels considered optimum for cacao trees.The report calculated that over the last decade, global heating had added an extra three weeks of temperatures exceeding 32C in Ivory Coast andGhanaduring the main growing season between October and March.Last year, the hottest year globally on record, they found global heating drove temperatures above 32C on at least 42 days across two thirds of the areas analysed.Researchers said “excessive heat can contribute to a reduction in the quantity and quality of the harvest”.Many other factors were potentially harming cacao trees and boosting prices, they noted, including mealybug infestations, rainfall patterns, smuggling and illegal mining.Christian Aid published separate research this week on the vulnerability of chocolate and cacao farmers to weather changes driven by global heating.The UK charity said conditions in west Africa had changed dramatically due to extreme rainfall and spoiled crops during the dry season in 2023 and the drought in 2024.“Growing cocoa is a vital livelihood for many of the poorest people around the world and human-caused climate change is putting that under serious threat,” said Osai Ojigho, the director of Christian Aid’s policy and public campaigns.Failed harvests had helped drive a significant rise in cocoa prices since late 2023 on the London and New York markets where the commodity is traded.New York cocoa prices were more than $10,000 a tonne on Wednesday, below a peak of more than $12,500 in mid-December. New York prices have largely hovered between $2,000 and $3,000 a tonne for decades.In January, the Swiss chocolate maker, Lindt & Sprüngli, said it would raise prices again this year to offset rising cocoa costs.Narcisa Pricope, a professor at Mississippi State University, said the crop faced an “existential threat” largely because of increasingly dry conditions in cacao-producing regions.Pricope was part of recent research from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification that found more thanthree-quarters of the Earth’s landmasshad become drier over the past 30 years.The emissions of greenhouse gases were the biggest cause of this aridity, she said, but practices that degraded soils and nature also played an important role.“Collective action against aridity isn’t just about saving chocolate – it’s about preserving the planet’s capacity to sustain life,” she said.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisWest African food and drinkFoodAfricaResearchIvory CoastGhananewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not the guy with the backpacks when they cross the Rio Grande.”During her news conference, Sheinbaum also mentioned Mexico’s spat with Google Map’sdecision to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, apparently at the behest of Trump, noting that the government had exchanged correspondence with the tech giant.“If necessary, we will file a civil suit,” she said. “Even President Trump isn’t proposing that the entire Gulf of Mexico be called the ‘Gulf of America’, but only their continental shelf.

Despite the scare, both returned to shore uninjured.Located about 1,600 miles (2,600km) south of Santiago, Chile’s capital, the Strait of Magellan is a major tourist attraction, known for adventure activities.Its frigid waters pose a challenge for sailors, swimmers and explorers who attempt to cross it in different ways.Although it’s summer in the southern hemisphere, temperatures in the region remain cool, with minimums dropping to 39F (4C) and highs rarely exceeding 68F (20C).While whale attacks on humans are extremely rare in Chilean waters, whale deaths from collisions with cargo ships have increased in recent years, and strandings have become a recurring issue in the last decade.Explore more on these topicsChileWhalesAmericasAnimalsMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

The labourers had to use dangerous gangplanks to unload Welsh coal imported on the island.The Postal Museum commissioned the research, which was supported byDr Anyaa Anim-Addo, an academic adviser, and it is part of a new exhibition about the postal industry’s connections with the slavery economy.Joanna Espin, a senior curator at the museum, said the research showed how the global postal service and its connected companies were “a tool of empire” rather than just a communication source.She said: “By ‘steaming’ its ships outside the British empire where slavery hadn’t been abolished, the RMSPC was able to exploit slave labour on the island. It is a complex story but we’re trying to show the choices made by the business and the way that the company benefited by exploiting enslaved labour.”The exhibition features postcards, letters, paintings and clothing from the era, alongside correspondence between UK plantation owners and Caribbean managers discovered in the museum’s archives.Letters from two enslaved women who secured freedom through manumission and protested against working conditions also feature in the exhibition, which is called Voices of Resistance: Slavery and Post in the Caribbean andopens in April.The exhibition has been created with Dollar fo’ Dollar, a St Thomas-based organisation, which researches and raises awareness of the island’s coal workers.Ayesha Morris, of Dollar fo’ Dollar, said her organisation wanted to “spread awareness of the memories of those who, basket by basket, fuelled steamships coming into the St Thomas harbour for about a century, who courageously fought for better wages and working conditions”.RMSPC, which wasfounded in Liverpool, was one of the most significant British companies of the Victorian era. It collapsed after what one writer called one of “the greatest frauds in history”.At the company’s 1920 annual general meeting, its leadership boasted that RMSPC was “carrying ocean trades in practically all parts of the world”, and a few years later the company’s ships carried 1.4 million passengers, transported nearly 14m tonnes of cargo and employed more than 35,000 people on its vessels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We regard this action as unsafe. We have made that clear. We have made it public as well as in private.”Australia’s defence department on Thursday also released information about three Chinese ships it had been monitoring in the Coral Sea, to Australia’s north, for several days.The flare incident is the latest contested run-in between military craft from the two countries, followinga similar aircraft encounter in the same area last yearand a highly controversial report ofa Chinese ship deploying sonar in close proximity to Australian navy diversin 2023.The latest incident, on 11 February, involved an Australian P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft conducting a “routine maritime surveillance patrol in the South China Sea” when it encountered a PLA-AF J-16 fighter aircraft, a statement from the defence department on Thursday afternoon said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“The PLA-AF aircraft released flares in close proximity to the RAAF P-8A aircraft. This was an unsafe and unprofessional manoeuvre that posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel,” the department said.AP excoriates White House barring of reporters as ‘alarming precedent’Read moreThe statement went on to say there were no injuries and no damage was sustained to the aircraft. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said if any flares had hit the Australian plane, it would have “had the potential for significant damage”.He told Sky News “a number of interactions” occurred between the two craft.“What’s important though is that the proximity of the J-16 was so close that there’s no way you could have been able to ensure that the flares did not hit the P-8,” he said.“We have made representations about our concerns to the Chinese government both yesterday and today here in Canberra, but also in Beijing.”But China defended its pilot’s actions. Guo Jiakun, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told a press conference overnight its military was provoked.“TheAustralian militaryaircraft deliberately intruded into China’s airspace over Xisha Qundao [the Xisha islands] without China’s permission. Such a move violated China’s sovereignty and undermined China’s national security. The Chinese side took legitimate, lawful, professional and restrained measures to expel the airplane.“China has lodged serious protests with Australia and urged it to stop infringing on China’s sovereignty and making provocations and stop disrupting peace and stability in the South China Sea.”Australia’s minister for education, Jason Clare, however, said on Friday that this account was “wrong”.“I know this is contested, but this is international air space. The actions of that Chinese pilot were wrong. When you fire off flares within 30 metres of another aircraft, it’s very, very dangerous, people could have got hurt, and that’s why we’ve made an official complaint to the Chinese government about this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mitsubishi was unlikely to participate, reports said.“Going forward, the three companies will collaborate within the framework of a strategic partnership aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles,” the trio said in a statement.The key China market and the car industry in general have been upended by the rapid rise of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers such as BYD. Nissan andHonda, like other carmarkers, are facing the prospect of tariffs in the US, another major market.Nissan is pushing ahead with a restructuring plan, announced in November, that includescutting 9,000 jobs and reducing global capacity by 20%. It has yet to disclose details such as which locations will be affected.The announcement will cause uncertainty for the company’s 130,000-strong workforce. However, it is thought the UK factory inSunderlandis unlikely to be affected.Before announcing the merger discussions in December, Nissan and Honda had been holding separate talks on a technology collaboration, which they could outline the scope of later on Thursday.Nissan is now open to working with new partners, with Taiwan’s Foxconn seen as one candidate, Reuters reported last week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were cascading delays across the network.Matt Longland, the chief executive of Sydney Trains, said 350 drivers and guards hadn’t turned up to work on Friday morning – including a “big uptick” in sick leave at rates not seen since the height of Covid.Disruptions were likely to worsen throughout the afternoon and evening, he said, while urging staff rostered on from 2pm to turn up for work.Longland said buses were shuttling travellers from Central station to the airport but he suggested, as an alternative, catching the Metro to Sydenham and then taking a taxi or Uber. The Metro is operated separately and was unaffected by industrial action.In response to the government refusing the one-off bonus – which had not been aired by the government or unions in nine months of negotiations but which the RTBU assumed would carry over from a previous agreement – the union ramped up work stoppages which had already been planned for Friday.Mookhey said the union was “gaslighting Sydney” and the suggestion the government had issued a staff lockout was false.“I’m so sorry that Sydney has woken up to a sneak strike in support of a wild claim. This turn of events could easily have been avoided had the union engaged in good faith negotiations,” he said.“I have seen some of the communications from the union. I do want to say that I think the union is gaslighting Sydney. What they’re saying to the public, what they’re saying to the government and what they’re saying to the courts is clearly very different to what they’re saying to their own members.”The 2023 bonus was included as a one-off payment to cover missed back pay, the government said.The acting transport minister, John Graham, said the government would lodge applications with the Fair Work Commission on Friday afternoon to attempt to quash any action before both parties were due to return to the commission for negotiations on Monday.At the centre of the latest disagreement is a demand for a $4,500 bonus payment for every rail worker – a sweetener that rail unions secured when negotiating its last pay deal with the previous Coalition government.A NSW government spokesperson said the unions had requested the bonus “at the last hour” of extensive negotiations on Thursday night. Mookhey said the unions had not raised continuing the payment once in their log of claims during months of negotiations.“After extensive negotiations over the last few days the unions at the last hour asked for a $4,500 bonus payment for every rail worker. This was never part of our offer, nor was it in the union’s counteroffer,” the spokesperson said on Friday morning.“As a result, the union has instructed drivers not to show up to work today.”But Toby Warnes, the secretary of the RTBU,called that claim “completely untrue”.Warnes said the bonus payment was “an existing entitlement contained within the last enterprise agreement” struck with the previous Coalition government – and “nothing new at all”.“Claims from the NSW government that rail workers threw an extra payment into the mix are completely untrue.”The RTBU claimed the NSW government had not raised the bonus payment or attempted to remove it from the new deal during months of negotiations.The government, however, insisted the bonus payment in the previous 2023 agreement was a one-off initiative – and not automatically continued into the next deal.Former coalition transport minister David Elliott, who was minister when the bonus was negotiated, confirmed the government’s understanding, telling 2GB radio on Friday the payment was a one-off for back pay.Warnes on Friday defended leaked communications reportedly from an RTBU convenor on Thursday night telling members “let’s fuck the network up”.The union boss said he didn’t authorise the message or tell workers not to go to work. Warnes said members were frustrated. “You’ve got a government that’s treated [them] very poorly for the past five months,” he said.The RTBU warned on Thursday night that trains would run 23km/hr slower than usual in areas where the speed limit was over 80km/hr, as part of protected industrial action.Warnes told a press conference on Friday morning that delays across the network were “entirely attributable to the government issuing, last Friday, 5,000 individual lockout notices to train crew workers” across the state.The notices were intended to take effect Wednesday, he said, and postponed by the government at midnight in efforts to reach an agreement – then took effect again overnight on Thursday “after negotiations fell over”.“So we have workers who are either showing up today and risking not getting paid by the government, or we have workers who have chosen not to attend work today because of those lockout notices,” Warnes said.“No one can predict the level of disruption that this is going to cause.”The claims about a “lockout” were disputed, with the government understood to be encouraging employees to turn up to work on Friday to minimise the disruptions.The NSW government spokesperson said “we have a fair and reasonable pay offer on the table”.“We can’t say yes to rail unions and no to nurses.”They said the government was looking at “all our options including urgent legal action”.Friday’s actions were the latest wave of disruptions in what has been a nine-month period in which combined rail unions and the state government have failed to agree on a new pay deal. The government has repeatedly sought to quash various work stoppages through legal interventions.The unions’ initial demands were for a 32% pay rise over four years. The government’s most recent offer was 15% over four years – a base 13% figure plus a 1% rise from efficiency gains and 1% in superannuation.Talks on the new enterprise agreement continue ahead of the next Fair Work Commission hearing on Monday,Transportfor NSW said in a media release.They said on Thursday that train union member drivers might operate trains at reduced speeds “however a normal train timetable will continue to operate”.“While we expect minimal disruption, the consequences of industrial action can be unpredictable.”–with Australian Associated PressExplore more on these topicsSydneyNew South WalesTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

The warning zone extended from Wallal Downs to Dampier, including Port Hedland, Karratha and Dampier, and inland to Marble Bar.Schools have been closed in the region with authorities expected to shut roads, including the Great Northern Highway, and set up a South Hedland evacuation centre.In the early hours of Friday morning, a cyclone emergency warning was issued for Pardoo Roadhouse to Whim Creek and inland to west of Marble Bar.“Shelter indoors now,” the warning said. “There is a threat to lives and homes.

Shortly after the announcement, Sabsabi admitted to being shocked at being chosen, telling the Guardian: “I felt that, in this time and in this space, this wouldn’t happen because of who I am.”Khaled Sabsabi never thought he’d be Australia’s pick for the Venice Biennale - podcastRead moreThe selection wasnot without its critics, however, amid a febrile political climate in which Anthony Albanese’s Labor government has been condemned by the opposition for what some have deemed an insufficient response toa spate of antisemitic attacksin recent months.It appears that Australia’s federal arts body Creative Australia, who picked Sabsabi alongside curator Michael Dagostino, have responded to political pressure to drop the artist. In a statement they said: “The board of Creative Australia has made the unanimous decision not to proceed with the artistic team chosen for theVenice Biennale2026. Creative Australia is an advocate for freedom of artistic expression and is not an adjudicator on the interpretation of art. However, the board believes a prolonged and divisive debate about the 2026 selection outcome poses an unacceptable risk to public support for Australia’s artistic community and could undermine our goal of bringing Australians together through art and creativity.”The decision comes after the issue made its way to the Australian Senate. During question time, Liberal senator Claire Chandler raised Sabsabi’s selection, saying: “With such appalling antisemitism in our country, why is the Albanese government allowing the person who highlights a terrorist leader in his artwork to represent Australia on the international stage?”Yet some critics have taken a more nuanced view of Sabsabi’s artworks. Describing You, the video installation using fractured images of Nasrallah, theMuseum Of Contemporary Art’s websitestates: “Sabsabi’s use of the multiplying image is purposefully ambiguous. It plays on western fears of cultural difference … and suggests the all-pervasiveness of the public news media, and its ability to deify or vilify through the intensive repetition of imagery on our television screens.” The title Thank You Very Much also plays with ambiguity: the work includes a clip of George W Bush, US president during the attacks, saying the phrase during a press conference.Sabsabi is no stranger to provocation and political statements. He has previously made work critical of Islamic State, and in 2009 embossed the letters Fuck Off We’re Full on a gallery wall. In 2022, he was one of 20 artists to withdraw from the Sydney festival over its sponsorship deal with the Israaeli embassy, saying that his works are “tied by blood to Palestine, the Palestinian cause and their right to self-determination and their right to return to their lands”.Speaking from his garage studio in Sydney, Sabsabi last week told the Guardian how thrilled he had been to be selected. “It’s an honour because the majority of my work and my passion and commitment over the years has been about ideas of representation, ideas of identity and looking at breaking stereotypes, especially within the Australian context of Muslims and Arabs,” he said.His work, which encompasses painting, moving image and scent art, draws from Sufism, the refugee crisis and Arab identity. But it is especially entwined with Sabsabi’s experience of having to flee Tripoli as a child: “Having the trauma of the civil war … this affects who I am and what I make.” he said.Creative Australia will now embark on selecting another artist to represent the country. Last year, Bigambul-Kamilaroi artist Archie Moorewon the Golden Lion at the biennalefor his exhibitionkith and kin– becoming the first Australian to win the prize.Explore more on these topicsVenice BiennalenewsShareReuse this content"

Common values cannot secure loans for military aid. And the US president does not care who controls the blood-soaked soils of eastUkraine, so long as he can access the rare earth minerals that lie beneath.The peace Trump will negotiate is not about justice. There is no deeper moral or morality here except for who “got it done”, and Trump has signaled that he is ready to pressure Ukraine and Europe to provide concessions to enticeRussiato sign on the dotted line.All that’s left for him is to hash out a price.“I’m just here to try and get peace,” Trump said in the Oval Office, where he riffs out policy daily. “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed.”It is difficult to put into words what an about-face this is for US support forUkraine, which for years was built on helping the country defend itself, though not win the war.The Biden administration helped manage the symptoms of Russian aggression. Now, Trump says he’s going to provide the cure. But it is an unwelcome one: stop resisting.Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, the adage in the Oval Office had been “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”. Biden officials regularly said in public that Ukraine itself would decide when it was ready to negotiate.But that was before the US election. It wasn’t the issue of Ukrainian manpower or the supply of weapons that ultimately brought us to this point; it was the price of eggs in Pennsylvania. The Biden administration’s biggest betrayal of Ukraine may have been to lose the US elections, effectively surrendering Ukraine’s second front to “America first”.“We’re the thing that’s holding it back, and frankly, we’ll go as long as we have to go, because we’re not going to let the other happen,” said Trump, in what may be the only silver lining of his remarks on Monday, indicating he wouldn’t allow Ukraine to collapse completely. “But President Putin wants that peace now, and that’s good, and he didn’t want to have peace with Biden.”Some Ukrainian and Russian observers may believe the US president has a deeper plan here, perhaps to consolidate Europe and then pressure Russia as a united front while sinking the oil price. Butjudging by his actions in Gaza, or in the United States, there is likely to be no deeper plan.Assigning Steve Witkoff, his go-to dealmaker who negotiated the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal, rather than the hawkish Gen Keith Kellogg, indicates that the process will be maximally unsentimental.Just another real estate deal.Now, much ofEuropeis wondering whether Trump is about to deliver them a fait accompli on their eastern flank, seeking to commit European troops with no Nato protection to Ukraine in a security agreement negotiated exclusively between Moscow and Washington.“What’s left to negotiate?” read one text message from a European official, who called it a “surrender”.In fact, that was just Trump’s opening offer.Russia has indicated it wants him to go further. In a communique, the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, said he wanted the deal to address the “origins of the conflict”, which he has previously said include Ukraine’s pro-western stance and the Nato expansions of the 2000s and 1990s.He may seek to turn back the clock, said another European official, and demand that US forces stationed in the Baltics, Poland and other former communist countries return, raising concerns about further Russian land grabs without American troops there to guarantee their defense.‘I feel angry and betrayed’: Ukrainians react to Donald Trump’s call to PutinRead moreSuch an outcome seemed even more possible on Thursday, when Trump’s defence secretary,Pete Hegseth, told his Nato counterparts that a reduction of US troop levels in Europecould be part of any deal.In effect, Trump is negotiating with Europe, not Russia. Europe has issued its counteroffer: treat us as a partner and give us a seat at the table.“We shouldn’t take anything off the table before the negotiations have even started,” said Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, before the Nato meeting on Thursday. “It is clear that any deal behind our backs will not work. You need the Europeans, you need the Ukrainians.”That depends what Trump plans to do next, as Hegseth made clear. “Everything is on the table,” he said. “In his conversations withVladimir Putinand Zelenskyy, what he decides to allow or not allow is at the purview of the leader of the free world: President Trump.”The question is who is in that free world now, and what is the price of entry.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropeRussiaUkraineVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyanalysisShareReuse this content"

And that has meant over the past 24 hours that some pronouncements by the British government have seemed at odds with reality.In the real world, we have just seen the US president make extraordinary concessionsin a call with the Russian president– no return to pre-2014 borders and a dismissal of Ukraine’s hopes of joining Nato.The response by British ministers is then to say that of course Trump is right to want peace inUkraine, but the priority is “putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position”.That makes very little sense just hours after Ukraine’s position was so undermined by Trump’s decision to engage with Putin directly on the terms of a possible peace deal.Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said there could be “no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine”. But that is what the US president has just done.1:05Zelenskyy says Ukraine won't accept any peace deal made by Trump and Putin alone – videoOfficials told journalists that Ukraine was definitely on a path to Nato membership – and that has been agreed by all Nato members including the US. “Nato has made a long-term commitment to Ukraine and its rightful place is in Nato,” Starmer’s spokesperson said.But again, just a few hours ago, the president had said that no longer applied. The words from his defence secretary are there in black and white. “The United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,” Pete Hegseth said.At a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels on Thursday, the UK’s John Healey and Hegseth were sat on the same table but merrily existing in parallel universes.Hegseth said the US no longer “primarily focused” on Europe’s security, an extraordinary moment which if it bears out may be the most consequential shift in US foreign policy since 1945. European leaders just smiled and pretended he had not said what he just said.Some might say this is nothing new. Leaders are adept at saying one thing in public and another in private. Sometimes it is necessary to continue to insist that black is white.There will be many European officials who agree privately that Nato membership for Ukraine is difficult, but are prepared to keep saying publicly that it is possible and insisting their US counterparts still agree that it is.And of course reality is being confronted behind the scenes in Brussels. There are now frantic efforts to make sure that Washington understands that no summit between Trump and Putin can go ahead and that the next step must be to fully involve Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even Hegseth’s speech was considerably toned down from a draft briefed to the press in advance.EU failed to Trump-proof Europe and now faces humiliation over UkraineRead moreBut Trump is unique among many world leaders because he does not play by the rules of private versus public. He is fully prepared to just agree something in a phone call with Putin and then post about it on Truth Social.Speaking at his press conference, Hegseth said starkly that the terms Trump laid out to Putin were just the reality of the situation, and that he was not prepared to pretend that they were not.All of this is quietly having an effect in Europe. That plain talking on security guarantees – that the US will not send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine – means European nations must now start to talk in realistic terms about what that implies for them.Starmer has a finer line to tread than most. He knows that he must keep his distance from European leaders when it comes to Trump. Many of the US president’s advisers see him as a dangerous lefty, but Trump himself seems won over by Starmer’s charm offensive so far, which may protect Britain from the worst of his plans for tariffs on the EU.If he is able to successfully straddle loyalties on both sides of the Atlantic, Starmer can be a useful bridge from Europe to Washington. It may even put him in the best position to help Ukraine. But it is never a comfortable position to be in.Explore more on these topicsUkraineForeign policyEuropeUS foreign policyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Everything is on the table in his conversation withVladimir Putinand [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy,” Hegseth told a press conference at the end of the meeting. “What he decides to allow and not allow is at the purview of the leader of the free world, of President Trump.”Trump unexpectedly announced on Wednesdayhe had spoken to Putinfor more than an hour and would begin peace talks with Russia and Ukraine, while Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine and the restoration of Crimea and other territories occupied by Moscow since 2014.On Thursday the US president repeated that he was convinced Putin “wants peace”. He also called for Russia’s return to the G7 group of industrialised nations, saying its expulsion was a mistake.Russia was suspended from the group – then the G8 – in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, and it announced its permanent withdrawal in 2017.Hegseth had also told allies the US was no longer “primarily focused” on European security.Map of UkraineThe Kremlin welcomed the developments on Ukraine, but the statements prompted a sharp push back from European politicians in public and private at theNatomeeting, who voiced concern that too much had been conceded by the US already and that Ukraine and Europe were at risk of being excluded from discussions.Zelenskyy warned world leaders “against trusting Putin’s claims of readiness to end the war” and said Kyiv could not accept as an independent country “any agreements without us”. He said he had been told by Trump on Wednesday, after the US president had spoken to Putin, that he wanted to speak to the Russian and Ukrainian leaders at the same time.1:05Zelenskyy says Ukraine won't accept any peace deal made by Trump and Putin alone – videoBut the Kremlin said Ukraine and Europe would be relegated to a parallel track in talks, and that Trump and Putin would meet in a few months, possibly in Saudi Arabia. “There will be a bilateral Russian-American track of this dialogue, and a track that will be related to Ukraine’s involvement,” said Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson.Hegseth was asked whether Europe should be prepared for the US to cut the 100,000 troop numbers it has deployed on the continent, and he appeared to link deployments to negotiations about Ukraine.“We have not said in any way we are abandoning our allies in Europe. There have been no decisions on troop levels, but that’s a discussion to be had by the commander-in-chief in these high-stakes negotiations,” Hegseth said.Russia did demand before the invasion in December 2021 that Nato cease all military activity in eastern Europe – and is still demanding that Ukraine cede further territory, reduce its army to a token level, and be prevented from joining the western military alliance in return for peace.About a sixth of Ukraine’s territory is occupied by Russia, including Crimea, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014, and large parts of the east and south that were mostly seized after the full-scale invasion in 2022. Kyiv’s leaders have signalled it may be willing to negotiate over territory, but Ukraine and its allies were formally committed to trying to restore its internationally recognised, pre-2014 borders.Map of Russian control in UkraineThose present at the Nato talks said Hegseth had come under pressure on Thursday from “a chorus of voices” to ensure Ukraine was properly represented in the peace discussions – while a day earlier at a Ukraine-related meeting he was told not to halt all US military aid to Ukraine.John Healey, the UK defence secretary, said Hegseth, a Fox News commentator, had sought to reassure allies that some degree of military aid would continue. “We know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are,” Hegseth said behind closed doors, according to Healey.The Kremlin also said it was impressed by the US positioning now that Trump had taken over the White House and that it believed there was “political will” on both sides to reach a negotiated settlement that was absent under Joe Biden.“The previous US administration held the view that everything needed to be done to keep the war going. The current administration, as far as we understand, adheres to the point of view that everything must be done to stop the war and for peace to prevail,” Peskov said.The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said Ukraine and Europe needed to be part of the peace discussions. “Any deal behind our backs will not work,” she said, and warned that too much had been conceded in public by the US.“Why are we giving them [Russia] everything that they want even before the negotiations have been started?” said Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister. “It’s appeasement. It has never worked.”The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, also complained that too much had been given away. “In my view it would have been better to speak about a possible Nato membership forUkraineor possible losses of territory at the negotiating table,” Pistorius said.The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister adept at smoothing over differences between Europe and Washington, said it was important Moscow understood that the west remained united, noting that Ukraine had never been promised that a peace deal would include Nato membership.The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, speaking in Berlin, said he believed the war must end but forcing a deal on Ukraine would not bring lasting peace. He said that while he supported Trump talking to Putin – and had done so himself in the past – the goal of such conversations was to make clear to the Russian leader “our expectations of a just peace in Ukraine and a return to a European security order in which borders cannot be changed by force”.He rejected “any solution that would lead to an uncoupling of European and American security”, saying that “only one person would profit from this – President Putin”.Closing the Nato meeting, Hegseth said he was committed to “make Nato great again” by demanding that other member countries lift their defence spending to 5% of GDP – which would require dramatic increases. The UK would have to more than double its existing spend of 2.33%.“The peace dividend has to end,” Hegseth said, though he refused to say if the US would increase its own defence spending from 3.4% of GDP. “3.4% is a very robust investment,” Hegseth said, but added: “Ultimately we have our own budgetary considerations.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS foreign policyPete HegsethDonald TrumpRussiaVladimir PutinEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2022, the transatlantic security establishment gathered in the knowledge that Putin was days from launching his attack on Kyiv. In February 2024, the opposition leader Alexei Navalny died in disputed circumstances in a Russian jail and this year Russia’s leader is on the brink of opening talks withDonald Trumpthat many analysts predict will end with Russia not just gaining Ukrainian territory but dismembering Ukraine as a sovereign independent state.For Europe it is a humiliation. And yet little that Trump or his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,said on Wednesdayabout their approach to a ceasefire including the US’s refusal to commit further resources to Ukraine could have come as a shock. Indeed Europe largely has only itself to blame.Since the Nato meeting in Newport, Wales, in 2014 that set the target of defence spending reaching 2% of GDP,Europecollectively has had numerous wake-up calls, commissioned strategic reviews, studies of collective defence capability, and generalised warnings from across the Atlantic. Hardly a year went by without the French president, Emmanuel Macron, or the Nato secretary general reaching ever deeper into the lexicon of doom about the alliance’s brain-dead status.After the shock of Trump’s first term, and the dawning realisation that he might return, the EU bureaucracy spoke of the need to Trump-proof Europe – yet with the steam train coming down the track the EU bureaucracy settled for one more strategic discussion and never reacted with the speed and decisiveness required. There was a collective failure of imagination.Trump’s senseless capitulation to Putin is a betrayal of Ukraine – and terrible dealmaking | Timothy Garton AshRead moreAs Europe now faces the challenge of being able to put a peacekeeping force into the field, the former MI6 chief Alex Younger admits Europe simply does not have the capabilities to operate without the US. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said as muchin his Guardian interviewwhen he said European security guarantees without the help of the US were worthless.There are many rational explanations for this shortfall, notably the belated recognition about the scale of the Russian threat. From 1999 to 2021 the European allies of Nato increased their deterrence investment by 23.9%. In the same period the US increased its figure by 65.7%,Russiaby 292% and China by 592%.Two months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the EU responded withthe portentous Versailles declarationstating: “Russia’s war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history. At our meeting in Versailles, we discussed how the EU can live up to its responsibilities in this new reality, protecting our citizens, values, democracies, and our European model.”1:05Zelenskyy says Ukraine won't accept any peace deal made by Trump and Putin alone – videoThe European Defence Agency was given until May 2022 to spell out the gaps in defence capabilities, and the leaders said they looked forward to the publication of theEuropean Strategic Compass“to provide guidance for action across these security and defence dimensions to make the European Union a stronger and more capable security provider”. If European Commission photocopiers could win wars, Moscow would long ago have surrendered.In a valedictory speech as the EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell said he had tried to make the EU effectively speak the “language of power” and close the gap between “Sunday’s speeches and Monday’s actions”. To be fair he developed theEuropean Peace Facility, and the Strategic Compass published in March 2022 listed 80 specific actions nation states needed to take.But as Nick Witney from the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank wrote at the time, “everyone agrees that [defence] integration is essential, but everyone wants someone else to go first”. He claimed the document was full of process-heavy gradualism, revealing the EU’s inability to intrude on national defence strategies.When Olaf Scholzannounced his €100bn investmentin German defence, the first two systems he bought were American – F-35s and Chinook helicopters. European defence capacity did not exist. Germany for historical reasons has resisted joint debt, and the German deficit is the proximate cause of the upcoming German election. There is little sign that the probable next German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is going to shift on this issue, making new forms of financing EU defence spending hard to agree.Even now there is debate about reforming EU finance rules to release extra defence spending.A group of 19 European countriesrecently co-signeda letter to the president of the European Council and the head of the European Investment Bank, urging them to relax restrictions on financing excluded activities – such as the production of ammunition, weapons, and military equipment – and to explore the possibility of issuing defence bonds.Nathalie Tocci, the head of the Italian thinktank Istituto Affari Internazionali and a past adviser to previous EU foreign affairs chiefs, has never disguised her frustration at the inability of countries to shift position. At a recent Council on Foreign Relations discussion she said: “Conversations about money and capabilities matter but so does the parallel conversation about people and psychology, We have looked atUkraineas indeed the good fight, but we still don’t feel it is our fight. Until and unless we do, we will keep on having these conversations about trade-offs, and if we spend a little bit more we can keep Trump happy, but it is not going to be sufficient.”Explore more on these topicsEuropeEuropean UnionNatoDonald TrumpUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

So far, Hamas has released 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages while Israel has freed about 730 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.Meanwhile, Israeli forces have pulled back to the periphery of the Gaza Strip. In the second phase of the ceasefire, the IDF is supposed to withdraw entirely from the territory and the remaining hostages are to be released along with hundreds more Palestinians held by Israel.Negotiations on the implementation of the second phase were due to begin last week, but so far Netanyahu has not empowered his negotiators to discuss that phase, which is intended to lead to the longer-term rebuilding of the territory.The prospect of a broader peace agreement was thrown into doubt by Trump’s shocking suggestion last week, welcomed by Netanyahu, that theUS would take possession of Gaza, and that its entire 2.2 million population would be transferred to neighbouring countries.The ceasefire deal, agreed only after nearly 46,000 Palestinians and 1,706 Israelis had died, looked in danger of collapse this week after the Hamas announcement on Monday that it would suspend hostage releases, drawing a rapid response from Trump. “As far as I’m concerned, if all of the hostages aren’t returned by Saturday 12 o’clock – I think it’s an appropriate time – I would say cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out,” the US president said on Monday night.Netanyahu and his government praised Trump’s hard line, but had been vague as to whether they would take his advice or stick to the agreed timetable.Egypt and Jordanhave said they will not accept the mass transfer of Palestinians from Gaza proposed by Trump. Egypt has called an emergency Arab summit on 27 February to discuss the situation and present a “comprehensive vision” for Gaza’s future. On avisit to Washington on Tuesday, Jordan’s King Abdullah also restated the consensus that Gaza should be rebuilt without the mass expulsion of its residents, and returned to Amman on Thursday to a hero’s welcome, with thousands lining the street in support of his stance.The flow of aid into Gaza has increased under the ceasefire but Israel has not allowed bulldozers and other construction equipment gathered on the Egyptian border with Gaza to cross into the Palestinian territory, saying that was not part of the ceasefire agreement.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaBenjamin NetanyahuUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was transferred to Kerman after her initial arrest.The UK Foreign Office did not issue a statement about the development, which came just as the new Iranian ambassador to the UK, Seyyed Ali Mousavi, was due to arrive.The UK and other European powers are under pressure from Iran to distance themselves from the recent economic sanctions reimposed on Iran by the US that may be a precursor to opening talks on Iran’s nuclear programme – but which could also hinder further talks.Iran securedthe Italian release of an Iranian exporter,Mohammad Abedini, wanted by the US for allegedly supplying goods used in a drone attack on US soldiers in Jordan. Abedini had been apprehended in Milan on a US warrant. Three days later Iran arrested Italian reporter Cecilia Sala in Tehran, who was in the country on a journalist’s visa.Washington had been seeking Abedini and another Iranian national’s arrest for allegedly supplying drone parts that the White House says were used in last year’s attack.After Sala had spent three weeks in an Iranian jail, the government of Giorgia Meloni released Abedini, leading to Sala’s release.Separately, German authorities have announced that the body of Jamshid Sharmahd, an Iranian-German political activistwho was executed in an Iranian prison in Novemberlast year, has been transferred to Germany and undergone an autopsy.The German foreign ministry said the transfer was the result of intensive diplomatic efforts. It is understood the negotiations over the body’s return was one reasonGermanyurged the Munich Security Conference not to issue an invitation to Iran’s crown prince Reza Pahlavi. The invitation was reinstated.The security atmosphere is tense in Iran with law enforcement officers stationed outside the University of Tehran after a call for a rally to protest against the 14-year detention ofMir Hossein Mousavi, a 2009 presidential candidate, and his wife, Zahra Rahnavard.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaGermanyItalyMir Hossein MousavinewsShareReuse this content"

Jewish people say no to ethnic cleansing!”The ad follows Trump’s proposal to “take over Gaza” and leave 2 million Palestinians who have survived Israel’s deadly onslaught against the narrow strip with “no alternative” but to leave their homes.Trump has called on Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries to take in Palestinians – a proposal that has been met with widespreadcriticismfrom Arab countries and other allies while being condemned as an ethnic-cleansing plan.Cody Edgerly, director of the In Our Name Campaign and one of the organizers of the ad, said it came at “a critical time as political redlines that were once thought immovable are rapidly shifting as the Trump-Netanyahu alliance takes hold again”.He said it had been “heartening to witness such a rapid outpouring of support from across the denominational and political spectrum”, adding: “Our message to Palestinians is that you are not alone, our attention has not wavered, and we are committed to fighting with every breath we have to stop ethnic cleansing in Gaza.”Trump’s proposal – which hasevokedthe painful legacy of the 1948 Nakba, during which hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forcibly displaced from their homes by Zionist paramilitaries – was described as an “insidious plan” by rabbi Toba Spitzer.In a news release accompanying the ad, Spitzer, senior rabbi of congregation Dorshei Tzedek in Newton, Massachusetts, said: “It is vitally important that we in the American Jewish community add our voices to all those refusing to entertain this insidious plan. Hitler’s dream of making Germany ‘Judenrein,’ ‘cleansed of Jews,’ led to the slaughter of our people.”“We know as well as anyone the violence that these kinds of fantasies can lead to. It is time to make the ceasefire permanent, bring all of the hostages home, and join in efforts to rebuild Gaza for the sake of and with the people who live there,” Spitzer added.Peter Beinart, editor-at-large of Jewish Currents, who also signed the ad, said: “It is utterly horrifying to see the degree to which people who enjoy great legitimacy and respect in our community are willing to support something that would be considered one of the greatest crimes of the 21st century.”Rabbi Yosef Berman of the New Synagogue Project in Washington DC said Trump “seems to believe he is God with authority to rule, own, and dominate our country and the world”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump’s desire to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza is morally abhorrent. Jewish leaders reject Trump’s attempts to wring profit from displacement and suffering and must act to stop this heinous crime,” Berman added.Since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October in 2023, killing approximately 1,200 Israelis while taking 251 people hostage, Israel launched a deadly war on Gaza. Over the last 16 months, Israeli forces have killed at least 48,200 Palestinians while forcibly displacing 2 million survivors across the narrow strip amid shortages in food, medical supplies and fuel due to Israeli aid restrictions.In an interview with Fox News’s Bret Baier at the weekend, Trump said he would “own” Gaza and said it would be a “real estate development for the future”. Asked whether Palestinians would have the right to return, Trump said: “No, they wouldn’t.”“In the meantime, I would own this,” Trump – a former real estate developer – added,saying: “Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land.

In one case, electricity transformers already delivered had to be put into storage because of the stop-work order, leaving a community without reliable electricity.“It was a shock that USAid was frozen for helping those communities that the US had helped to survive. [Before], US help was omnipresent,” said Mirza Dinnayi, a prominent Yazidi human rights activists who runs the House of Co-Existence (HOC) multicultural community center in Sinjar.He said that USAid, which provided the vast majority of humanitarian funding to the area, had been was a “pillar of stabilisation and normalisation”.“They had a crucial role in his first administration for recognising the Yazidi genocide and supporting US aid to helpIraq,” said Dinnayi. “Minority rights and religious freedoms were supported in the first administration. I’m wondering why the second administration is not aware about that.”View image in fullscreenYazidis women hold pictures of their missing relatives on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the genocide.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianCharities supporting Christian minorities, such as Catholic Relief Services (CRS), have also been directly affected by the work stoppage, including their programs in Iraq’s Nineveh Plains area and among Christian communities, according to people familiar with their work in the area. CRS, a top recipient of funds from USAid, is facing up to 50% layoffs this year and has begun shutting down programs that account for half of the organization’s $1.5bn budget, according to anemail obtained by the National Catholic Reporter.“I see a lot of harm in the abrupt way that this assistance has stopped,” said a former USAid employee in Iraq.Meanwhile in Washington, a coterie of conservatives – many with former ties to Pence and USAid – have now allied with Elon Musk’s effort to take down the agency.One of them is Max Primorac, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation’s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, who authoredProject 2025’s chapter on USAid recommending a blueprint to downsize the agency. He isset to testifybefore the House foreign affairs committee on Thursday at a hearing titled the “USAid betrayal”.Primorac did not respond to a request for an interview sent through the Heritage Foundation.View image in fullscreenYazidi people head towards the Syrian border in 2014.Photograph: Rodi Said/ReutersPrimorac is one of a number of prominent conservatives who supported Pence’s initiative to support religious minorities but have now gone on record backing the aid freeze. Others include Pence himself, Vice-President JD Vance, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and Pete Marocco, the Trump ally and USAid skeptic who nonethelessprotected funding to religious initiatives under Pence. Marocco even reportedly led operations with his Patriot Group International to exfiltrate Yazidis in 2016.From late 2018 to early 2019, Primorac traveled to Erbil and northern Iraq as Pence’s special envoy, “overseeing a multi-agency genocide recovery effort to assist religious minority returns”, according to his current biography on the Heritage Foundation’s website.Colleagues said he arrived with a dim view of USAid but that he came to support at least some of the efforts the agency was making in the field.Trump ally Peter Marocco behind evisceration of USAid: ‘He’s a destroyer’Read more“He had a couple of visits to areas where we worked and I think that changed him a bit in a positive way,” said a USAid employee.Now, the person said, “for someone who really believed in his mission supporting religious minorities, he does not seem to be paying attention or advocating for a way forward.”Primorac later boasted that he had led a “$400m counter-genocide program … to spur the return of Iraqi Christians to their ancient homeland” and excoriated the Biden administration for turning its back on Iraq’s “traumatised” Christians.“Under the Trump administration, I led acounter-genocideprogram in Iraq to help Christian and Yazidi victims recover fromIS’s campaign of extermination,” he wrote in another article for Newsweek. “We provided these traumatized religious minorities with humanitarian aid, [and] psycho-social help.”Now he has become one of the leading voices calling for the agency’s dissolution, authoring a recent Fox News editorial “how USAid went woke and destroyed itself”. An advance copy of his testimony to the House set for Thursday did not reference his work in Iraq.Former colleagues say they share some of Primorac’s criticisms of USAid but were perplexed by his full-scale repudiation of their work, the programs he previously cooperated with.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community gather for humanitarian aid at the Syria-Iraq border in 2014.Photograph: Khalid Mohammed/AP“If we are going to achieve meaningful reform in the foreign assistance system, we need honest dialogue, and it’s important for me to acknowledge that I share some of his critiques about USAid,” said a person who leads a major USAid-funded project in Iraq.“I only wish that [Primorac] would approach the conversation in a similar way, acknowledging all of the great work that USAid has achieved – especially in Iraq.”The change reflects how top Republicans are hedging their views under the Trump administration and a campaign led by Musk to eviscerate the agency, which he has called “criminal” and “corrupt”.Current and former USAid members in the field said that they have heard nothing from their former supporters in the US, and have in effect been cut out of systems that would give crucial information on budgets and projects meant to support communities.“It’s quite puzzling, to be honest,” said one former USAid employee in Iraq.Meanwhile, the onslaught in Washington has continued. At the International Religious Freedom Summit last week, Vance denounced USAid for promoting “atheism” while boasting of “bringing relief to Yazidis, Christians and other faith communities facing genocidal terror from Isis” in the past.“It was perplexing to hear the vice-president champion these initiatives while, at the same time, funds for efforts like these are literally being turned off,”wrote Adam Nicholas Phillips, the lead administration official at USAid working on faith-based partnerships during the Biden administration.“Maybe the attacks on USAid are just misinformed and will be righted. Maybe there is a bold plan to invest in foreign assistance. I take administration officials at their word and I’m praying these decisions are reversed with haste.”Explore more on these topicsIraqUSAidMike PenceSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaIslamic StateUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

A new one every week. Before, you might see between zero and 10 to a dozen in an average year.”It is an effort that has been supported by the building of new illegal roads which, in the area east of Tko’a, have been bulldozed into the hills. “The Bedouin here are the weakest and most vulnerable of the Palestinian communities and they are being displaced as communities and made homeless,” Mizrachi said.A short drive south brings you to Minya and a massive open landfill site on the edge of the desert hills where, a kilometre or so from the dump, Bedouin are still trying to remain on their land.Middle EastIn one small encampment, Jameel and Mujahid Shalalda have managed to hang on, despite a campaign of violence since a group of young extremist settlers arrived nearby in December.The shacks of the settlers known as the Flock of Abraham are visible in the near distance, their cars moving across a nearby hill.The Guardian is shown a video of recent attacks: settlers attempting to frighten the Bedouin flocks, setting fire to a building, stealing equipment and setting a dog on the Bedouin children.“There are two tribes here. We’ve been here for 52 years,” said Jameel. “The settlers arrived three months ago. Every day and every night we are afraid what they will do. There was another family here, but they were frightened into leaving. But we have nowhere else to go.“They’ve destroyed structures in our camp and even though we have been to the police they do nothing.”Yehuda Shaul of Ofek, the Israeli Centre for Public Affairs, said: “We are talking about thousands and thousands of dunums of land.” A dunum is equivalent to a quarter of an acre.“What’s happening around Tko’a is what is happening elsewhere,” said Shaul. “New areas being cleansed by settler violence.”Shaul said that in the 12 months before 7 October 2023 “we saw something like 100 Palestinians displaced” but in the months after the Hamas attack it was 1,400. He added that the acceleration of settler activity in the Tko’a area was being accommodated by the current Israeli political climate.“Three and a half years ago there were around 240,000 dunums Palestinians could not access because of settler violence,” he said. “Today that figure is close to 800,000. That’s 12% of the West Bank.”What was important now, Shaul said, was how Israeli settlers who had long behaved with impunity in Area C were now shifting their tactics to new parts of the West Bank with the aim of completely fragmenting the territory intended for a future Palestinian state.“Now the settlers have become increasingly emboldened, the language being used is about the ‘battle over open space’, avoiding talking about Area B or C,” he said. “Because saying that, in their view, reinforces the Oslo paradigm which they reject.“It’s now not good enough that Palestinians are contained in Areas A and B. Now the goal is that they must be contained in the built-up areas. The open spaces – they say – are ours. They are trying to put the last nail in the coffin [of a meaningful Palestinian state.]”Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

He went on: “We took the decision … that we wouldn’t breathlessly chase every headline that was coming out over the last month.“I think that’s the right decision.”Trump has announced a series of tariffs throughout the first few weeks of his presidency, includingearlier this week imposing a 25% levy on steel imports.Having announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico,he later suspended these for 30 days following negotiations.Canada and Mexico have readied retaliatory tariffs should the duties come into effect, as has the EU, which Trump has repeatedly threatened,while China has already taken retaliatory stepsto a 10% tariff on its exports to the US.McFadden would not be drawn on whether the UK planned to retaliate, saying it was “premature” to talk about the possibility.He said: “How mature would it be for me to walk into a studio five minutes after some announcements and say ‘yeah, we’re going to retaliate’?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The number of people diagnosed with cancer has soared amid better awareness of symptoms, successful NHS initiatives to spot and treat cancer earlier, and a growing and ageing population.Macmillan, created 114 years ago, also plays a key role in NHS provision, funding 11,000 specialist cancer nurses and care workers, and providing specialist financial and emotional support to more than 130,000 people with cancer each year.The charity says the tough financial climate has forced it to make major cuts to its workforce and services to secure its “long-term financial sustainability”.In 2018, Macmillan’s board agreed to maintain spending on services despite flatlining income from donations. By regularly drawing on reserves over the next six years it was able to spend £100m more than it raised from the public and corporate sponsors.Although still one of the UK’s most successful fundraisers, by 2023 donations were failing to keep pace with rising costs and demand for cancer support. The last annual figures show its £232m income was dwarfed by £265m spending.Macmillan is also likely to face questions over its decision to axe its vital hardship grants scheme. It was introduced 100 years ago, when the charity – then the National Society for Cancer Relief – introduced handouts for medical fees, nursing care, clothing, artificial limbs and hot water bottles.The last annual figures show Macmillan distributed £17m via one-off £200 payments to low-income cancer patients to help them with transport costs for hospital visits or heating bills.The grants are means-tested – only households on very low incomes with savings of under £1,000 are eligible – and their value has shrunk in recent years from £350 to £200 as demand has soared.Macmillan says it will continue to support “the most vulnerable people with cancer” but has not specified how it will do so or who exactly would remain eligible for financial help in the future.The scheme is the UK’s only national cancer hardship fund, the Guardian found. Scrapping it will affect thousands of the country’s poorest cancer patients, at the same time as the UK experiences record levels of destitution and deep poverty.A breast cancer patient featured on Macmillan’s website, Laura, spoke of her “complete disbelief” when she was told she could get a £200 grant. “I cried so much but this time with happiness. I could pay my rent this month and be able to buy some oil for heating.”A second patient, Linda, diagnosed with breast and kidney cancer, said the grant enabled her to keep the heating on as she recovered from surgery. “Though I was signed off work on sick pay, it wasn’t enough to cover the higher costs of heating my home, so the grant really did make a difference.”Cuts to Macmillan’s helpline teams will see fewer phone operators and reductions in the level of specialist financial advice and emotional support they can give to callers.Sharp rise in cancer patients in England waiting months for treatmentRead moreMacmillan said that like many charities, it had felt the impact of the financial climate and had made changes to help refocus its resources, and to secure its long-term financial sustainability.The charity confirmed it had put 1,262 people at risk of redundancy, of whom 239 took voluntary redundancy and 174 were made redundant. A spokesperson said: “We had to make some very difficult decisions including reducing the size of our organisation by 26%.”Macmillan’s aim was to support more cancer patients, the spokesperson added. “To do that with less money and a smaller team, we must focus on developing the services which we can scale up to meet growing need. We’ve reviewed all of our services, including the grants we offer where demand far outweighs the funds we have, and made the difficult decision to close this offer.”The spokesperson added: “Throughout, we have tried to minimise disruption for people with cancer.” Macmillan was now in a “strong financial position to continue to offer vital support to people with cancer into the future”.Explore more on these topicsCharitiesCancerHealthVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Trouble flared at a meeting in May last year when Pease, a former RAF squadron leader, was called on to give his ward councillor’s report, according to the investigation.Darling began reading a long list of prepared questions to Pease with the conversation becoming heated because Darling was asking them “in a raised voice and provoking manner” and not allowing time to answer.Pease then stood up, pointed his finger on the table and called Darling “a prat … before going towards the door to exit the room”.According to Darling’s wife, Pease said: “Why are you sticking your nose in”, “you can carry on running your own little fiefdom without me” and, finally, “I’m not listening to that prat” before heading to the door.The report says there is a dispute about who started it “and who assaulted who”.Pease accused Darling of “grabbing him round the neck, head-butting his nose resulting in blood on his shirt with cuts and bruises on his collarbone and arms”.Darling denied this saying Pease “punched him first”. He suffered a bruised finger.According to the meeting’s chair, Hazel Bullock, it was Darling who “set upon” Pease who reciprocated “with both men being locked in a very physical exchange of attempted punches and hair pulling”.Another councillor said Darling went towards Pease in a “rugby-type tackle” and it “was like a wrestling match”.Another said there was “lot of pushing and shoving” and both parties were as responsible as the other. One witness said: “Darling flung his arm around CP’s neck and punched him three times in the face.” Another said the men were just “ragging each other around”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They include Bullock saying “for goodness sake have some dignity David stop” and another person saying “no, hey Colin, Colin, Colin stop it.”One witness is heard shouting: “David you will end up having a stroke doing that, sit down.”The investigator, Ellie Dewar, says in the report: “The majority of evidence supports a view that councillor Darling initiated the physical altercation by grabbing hold of councillor Pease’s neck. This led to punches being thrown. In my view councillor Pease has acted in reasonable and proportionate self-defence in trying to get his attacker off him.”The report says it will be for members of the council’s standards committee, meeting on Monday, to decide if code of conduct provisions have been breached.Both men have been approached for comment. Pease told the Guardian he would save his comment for Monday’s meeting.Explore more on these topicsNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But due to a communication mix-up between the duty emergency registrar, Dr Rebecca McMillan, and nurses, the “life-saving” drug was not administered within the vital first hour of treatment, the inquest heard.Burns said her son only got the antibiotics after she warned Dr Luke Lake, the acting medical registrar on duty at the time, about the failure to administer the drug. In written evidence read to the court, she said: “I told him I didn’t think William had the antibiotics. Luke reassured me, that they had been written up earlier. I replied: ‘Yes, but they have not been given.’”Lake told the inquest he had realised earlier that the drug blunder had occurred after checking on Hewes’s chart. But questioning him, the family’s barrister, Neil Sheldon KC, said: “The reality is that Dr Burns did prompt you to question whether or not antibiotics had been given and it wasn’t something you queried independently.”Lake replied: “That’s not how I remember things. She may have chased. I can’t be crystal clear.”Earlier, McMillan recounted her distress when she realised at about 1.17am that the drug had not been administered by nurses as she requested.She said: “I do recall standing outside the resus room with [nurse Marianela Balatico] where she asked if I was OK and said that I looked really upset when I realised that antibiotics had not been given.“We had a conversation along the lines of we didn’t understand how this had happened. We were both upset when we realised that this hadn’t happened.”Fighting back tears, McMillan said one of the “learning points” from Hewes’s death was the need “to be clearer who I’m giving instruction to”. She added: “I obviously thought that my instructions had been clear enough. I have thought about that moment over and over.”The coroner, Mary Hassell, had relayed Balatico’s previous evidence to the court when the nurse admitted the instruction to give Hewes antibiotics had “slipped my mind” as she focused on relieving his symptoms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McMillan said she was concerned that she had to plead with Dr Mathuratha Sivasubramanian, the intensive care registrar responsible for admission, the court heard.Sivasubramanian advised continuing Hewes’s treatment in the emergency unit and waiting for further assessment before admitting him to intensive care.The coroner said: “It sounds like an argument.” McMillan replied: “She wasn’t behaving with the same urgency that I was conveying.”McMillan also said there was confusion between the three doctors over who was responsible for Hewes’s care. She said: “My worry is that I don’t think it was completely clear between the three of us who was keeping complete oversight and who had primacy for caring for William.”The inquest continues.Explore more on these topicsSepsisLondonHospitalsNHSEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

What I know about how the disciplinary system is supposed to work is, apology or not, that person should be removed from post while being investigated.”The assistant coroner Nicholas Rheinberg suggested to Young he appeared “incensed”. He replied: “100%.” He said: “I think that an apology letter shouldn’t even be offered in that situation. Why is that an acceptable outcome for that, especially with someone holding such a high rank?”Young said that when Beck told him about Mason’s behaviour towards her, which she considered“psychotic and possessive”, he encouraged her to report him.But he said: “She didn’t want to seem like that girl that was constantly putting in complaints. She was worried that she’d just be seen as causing drama. She loved the job – the biggest fear was being taken off the team. She was worrying they would just remove her from the situation rather than deal with the issue.”Bdr Braddon Haigh told the inquest that Beck had described the letter of apology from Webber as “pathetic”.“I saw it and briefly read it, and I just remember her saying it was pathetic, an easy win for him to write the letter,” he said.“That whole team clearly looked out for each other in a way that if someone comes with a service complaint it is just brushed under, write your letter, done and dusted. If she can’t come forward when there is solid evidence about a sergeant major what good is the system?”Webber appeared at the inquest on Wednesday and refused to answer questions about the alleged sexual assault.The hearing continues.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

He now appears to be intent on changing that and flying in the face of current protocols, also announcing the potential for more cooperation with the federal government from the New York police department.“We also discussed ways to embed more NYPD detectives into federal task forces, focusing on these violent gangs and criminal activity,” Adams said of his meeting with Homan.Murad Awawdeh, director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said that the mayor was trying to do “an end run” around local laws, making himself complicit with Trump’s “detention to deportation pipeline” in exchange for favors.“This is a deal made with the devil to try to roll back our city’s longstanding sanctuary laws and policies – policies that allow all New Yorkers to live freely while improving everyone’s public safety. History will not look kindly on his betrayal of our communities,” he said, adding that the mayor could expect opposition to his “legally dubious” move from ordinary New Yorkers and city lawmakers.Adams had said before the meeting that he intended to bring up the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) move on Wednesday to claw back more than $80m it had previously paid the city to help defray the cost of sheltering more homeless migrants.He is under strong pressure increasingly to cooperate with the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, in what appears to be a carrot-and-stick approach – with money being withdrawn but at the same time the Department of Justice (DoJ) intervening with federal prosecutors in Manhattan and ordering them to drop a criminal corruption case against Adams.The mayor has been struggling amid a sprawling federal corruption investigation that hascost himkey lieutenants and resulted in the mayor himselfbeing indictedlast September,accused ofaccepting bribes and illegal campaign contributions.On Monday, the DoJ ordered federal prosecutorsto dropthe indictment against Adams, in astunning intervention, saying it wasrestricting himfrom immigration enforcement.This last move from Washington prompted the Manhattan US attorney in charge of the caseto resignon Thursday, reportedlyalong withtwo other top officials.US justice department official seeks dismissal of charges against Eric AdamsRead moreNews that Adams was weighing whether to allow Ice to re-establish an office at the city’snotoriousRikers Island jail first emerged after that first meeting with Homan in December.Homan at the timetold the New York PostAdams has done “a complete 180” on immigration policy in terms of being willing to cooperate with the federal government.Proponents of the idea say having an Ice facility at the jail would make it easier for federal agents to deport people held there before they can be released on to the streets.Prior to Thursday’s meeting, Adams had recently enraged immigration advocates after aleaked memorevealed guidance appearing to make it easier for Ice officers to go into what had previously been designated as sensitive locations, such as schools, migrant shelters, churches and hospitals – only to have to walk back some of the policy language later after an outcry.“We will not put a frontline worker in harm’s way and subject to arrest by federal officers simply by doing their job,” said the city’s corporation counsel, Muriel Goode-Trufant, whoissuedthe video and flowchart with new guidelines that she said apply to many city agencies.Under current law, signed by the former mayorBill de Blasio, New York City police and corrections officers do not usually cooperate with Ice enforcement, and Ice is prohibited from many locations except when they have a warrant signed by a judge that alleges a serious crime has been committed.“I cannot have any city employee that will get in the way of [Ice] carrying out their job as a federal authority. That would be irresponsible for me,” Adams said last Sunday in aninterviewon the WABC Latino-issues program Tiempo.Adams went out of his way tomeet Trumpafter the election and establish a warm relationship with the Republican now president and his team, in an unlikely alliance.Advocates say Adams’s stance on sanctuary laws seems weak at best.Awawdeh said Adams’s “dangerous” policy on Ice access to sensitive locations “will further force families into the shadows and leave countless New Yorkers vulnerable to detention and deportation simply for accessing basic services”. He called on Adams to reverse the policy completely or face a lawsuit.View image in fullscreenPeople protest against Donald Trump’s anti-immigration policies in New York.Photograph: Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty ImagesMany New Yorkers are living in fear after recent Ice raids thathave reportedlyscooped up at least 100 residents.It is far from clearhow manyconvicted criminals have been arrested so farduring high-profileIce raids. And, at Rikers Island, the vast majority of those held at the jail have not been convicted of their charges. In August 2023, 87% of its approximately 6,000 detainees were there pre-trial, according to a city comptrollerreport.“As the Trump administration’s goals of causing panic and fear while carrying out harmful detention is happening in New York and around our country, we are more concerned than ever about the mayor’s persistent claims that he will seek to roll back laws our communities have long relied on to feel safe,” said Yasmine Farhang, director of advocacy at the city-based Immigrant Defense Project (IDP).The Ice New York field office did not respond to requests for comment.“Reestablishing the Ice ERO [enforcement and removal operations] unit at Rikers would allow ERO NYC officers to take direct custody of foreign-born criminal offenders without the need to re-apprehend these criminals at large in the community,” Todd Lyons, assistant director of field operations,wroteon his LinkedIn page in December.Discussions of reopening Ice at Rikers stand as “one more example of the city trying to use city resources to further Ice’s agenda”, said Rosa Cohen-Cruz, director of immigration policy for the Bronx Defenders advocacy group.View image in fullscreenEric Adams with Trump’s ‘border czar’ Tom Homan in New York in December.Photograph: Michael Appleton/Mayoral Photography Office via APCohen-Cruz pointed to research such as a 2022studyby the University of Texas at Austin, showing that sanctuary city policies increase community safety because immigrants are more willing to engage with government, political systems and important local services.Cohen-Cruz said that since most held at Rikers are either awaiting trial or charged with misdemeanors, Ice interactions could delay or deny their due-process rights.“It really does impact communities and create distrust between communities and state and local actors,” she said. “We want to make sure that immigrants know they can interact with the government and not fear that their information will be shared with Ice,” she said.The IDP and Bronx Defenders are calling on the city council to passa new lawgiving individuals the right to sue if they believe immigration detention violates their rights.The Associated Press contributed reportingThis article was amended on 13 February 2025 to clarify that current city law would prohibit Ice from opening an office at the Rikers Island jail.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkEric AdamsDonald TrumpUS immigrationUS prisonsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Stacked with Trump loyalists, the new board terminated the center’s president, Deborah Rutter, and installed Trump as chair. The board then named Richard Grenell, who served as ambassador to Germany during the firstTrump administration, as interim president.In response, several stars have disassociated from the center.Issa Rae, creator and star of Insecure, announced on her Instagram story on Thursday that she was cancelling her upcoming one-night-only show at the Kennedy Center. The sold-out show, An Evening with Issa Rae, was scheduled at the venue in March.“Unfortunately, due to what I believe to be an infringement on the values of an institution that has faithfully celebrated artists of all backgrounds through all mediums, I’ve decided to cancel my appearance at this venue,” Rae wrote.Kennedy Center board votes to elect Trump as new chairRead moreOn Wednesday, the renowned soprano Reneé Fleming said she would step down from her role as artistic adviser to the center. Though her statement did not mention Trump, she praised its ousted chair David M Rubenstein and Rutter, and said: “Out of respect, I think it right to depart as well.“I’ve treasured the bipartisan support for this institution as a beacon of America at our best,” she said. “I hope the Kennedy Center continues to flourish and serve the passionate and diverse audience in our nation’s capital and across the country.”The creator of Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy,Shonda Rhimes, alsoresignedfrom her position as treasurer while the singer-songwriter Ben Folds revealed that he would also be stepping down as artistic adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra.“Given developments at the Kennedy Center, effective today I am resigning as artistic advisor to the NSO,” hewrotein an Instagram statement. “Not for me.”When Trump wasasked by presslast week why he wanted to be chair he said it was because they didn’t need “woke” at the Kennedy Center. “Some of the shows were terrible, they were a disgrace,” he said.

Hewas first arrested in Greece in 2017at the request of the United States after he wascharged by a US juryin a 21-count indictment.Thecharges againsthim included money laundering, conspiracy to commit money laundering, operating an unlicensed money service business and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions, among others.Vinnik was first extradited to France from Greece, where he received a five-year prison sentence for money laundering. He was then sent back to Greece and extradited tothe United States in 2022to face US charges.The justice departmentdescribedBTC-e, which was active from around 2011 to 2017, as a “significant cybercrime and online money laundering entity that allowed its users to trade in bitcoin with high levels of anonymity and developed a customer base heavily reliant on criminal activity”.Prosecutors say that BTC-e processed over $9 bn worth of transactions and served over 1 million users globally, including numerous customers in the US.US prosecutorssaidthat the exchange was one of the “primary ways by which cyber criminals around the world transferred, laundered, and stored the criminal proceeds of their illegal activities” and accused Vinnik of operating the company with the intent to “promote” unlawful activities. Prosecutors said that he wasresponsiblefor more than $120m in losses.It wasreported in 2023that Vinnik’s lawyers were trying to include him in any potential US-Russia prisoner swap involving detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.Vinnik, who is a nonviolent offender, is forfeiting tens of millions of dollars in assets in the exchange, according to theNew York Times.His sentencing was scheduled to take place in June.Vinnik’s release comes two days after Russian authorities released Pennsylvaniaschool teacher Marc Fogel.Fogel had been held inRussiasince 2021. He was sentenced to 14 years behind bars on drug-trafficking charges after Russian officials discovered less than an ounce of marijuana in his luggage at a Moscow airport.Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the release of Fogel could be an “important part” of ending the Ukraine war and that theUS gave up “not much”to secure Fogel’s release.He told reporters: “We were treated very nicely by Russia, actually. I hope that’s the beginning of a relationship where we can end that war.”Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser,said in a statementon Tuesday that the US and Russia “negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsRussiaBitcoinCryptocurrenciesnewsShareReuse this content"

Now a fast-growing business, it revealed plans last year to formally change its corporate structure.Musk and his own AI startup, xAI, and a consortium of investment firms want to acquire the non-profit’s controlling stake in the for-profit OpenAI subsidiary.OpenAI’s CEO,Sam Altman, quickly rejected the unsolicited bid in a post on social media and told questioners at a Paris summit on AI that the company is not for sale. The chair of OpenAI’s board, Bret Taylor, echoed those remarks at an event on Wednesday.Musk and Altman helped start OpenAI in 2015 and later competed over who should lead it before Musk resigned from the board in 2018. They have been in a long-running and bitter feud over the startup, with Musk suing, dropping his suit, and then suing again in 2024.Musk again criticized Altman’s management on Thursday during a video call to the World Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, describing it as akin to a non-profit aimed at saving the Amazon rainforest becoming a “lumber company that chops down the trees”. Altman has repeatedly countered that Musk’s legal challenges to OpenAI are motivated by his role as the founder of a competing startup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, Trump signed a presidential memorandum ordering the development of a comprehensive plan to address what the White House described as “longstanding imbalances” in the global economy.Americans could face “some short-term disturbance” if the US imposes higher tariffs on foreign goods, Trump acknowledged. “Prices could go up somewhat short-term,” he said. “But prices will also go down.”“What will go up is jobs,” claimed Trump. “The jobs will go up tremendously.”The US commerce department, now led by the billionaireHoward Lutnick, will conduct studies and report back to the president at the start of April. No exemptions will be offered from any “reciprocal” duties introduced under the new plan, Trump suggested.Inflation picks up speed after Trump promised to ‘rapidly’ bring down pricesRead moreIt is the latest bid by Trump to strain Washington’s trade ties with countries across the world – allies and rivals alike – to obtain political and economic concessions.A press notice circulated by theTrump administrationpromised it would take action to “put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security”.US officials pointed to a series of examples of tariffs and other trade barriers that they said demonstrated how other countries were not treating the US fairly. They pointed to the European Union’s 10% tariff on cars, alongside the 2.5% US tariff on cars, and claimed that shellfish from 48 states cannot be exported to the EU, while the bloc “can export all the shellfish it wants to America”.They also cited a 100% tariff imposed by India on US motorcycles, while the US only charges 2.4%, and an 18% duty in Brazil on US ethanol, while the US charges 2.5%.Trump is due to meet Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, later on Thursday. Addressing reporters, he argued the EU was “very nasty”, adding: “They don’t treat us right on trade.”He also suggested that the US could hit the so-called Brics alliance – which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – with 100% tariffs, if it sought to undermine the US dollar.Trump also called for Russia’s return to the G7 group of industrialised nations, saying it had been a mistake for Moscow to be expelled.Russia was suspended from the group – then known as the G8 – in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea, and announced its permanent withdrawal in 2017.While the president and his allies believe that higher taxes on imports will help “make America great again”, they have also claimed the mere threat of higher tariffs from the world’s largest economy can prompt nations to bend to Trump’s will.Trump had trailed this announcement for days, at first promising news on Tuesday or Wednesday, before claiming early on Thursday that he would announce reciprocal tariffs – “THE BIG ONE”, he wrote on social media – later in the day. In the event, no specific new tariffs were announced.The administration has so far threatened more tariffs than it has introduced.Duties on Colombia were shelvedwhen it agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported immigrants; duties on Canada and Mexico have beenrepeatedly delayed; andmodified duties on steel and aluminum, announced earlier this week, will not be enforced until next month.Why Trump blinked before imposing his ‘beautiful’ tariffs on Canada and MexicoRead moreAnadditional 10% tariff on goods from Chinais, for now, the only threatened trade attack actually enforced since Trump returned to the White House. On Friday, it emerged that a key component of this – removing the longstanding duty-free status of low-cost packages –had been delayed.Trump’s fixation with tariffs hasalarmed economists, who have warned their imposition may derail his repeated promises to rapidly bring down prices for millions of Americans.Inflation is already proving stubborn. In January, as Trump returned to office, it ticked up to an annualized rate of 3%. Egg prices have beensoaring in recent months, as many US consumers continue to grapple with the elevated cost of living.Trump said he would not commission any studies into how his mooted tariffs could affect prices for Americans. “There’s nothing to study,” he said. “It’s going to go well.”Asked whether the Trump administration’s plan to align US tariffs with those imposed by other countries risked raising prices for US consumers, Lutnick – standing alongside the president – sought to shift responsibility onto other countries. “​If they drop their tariffs, prices for Americans are going down​,”​ he said.Trump has frequently highlighted the US’s trade deficit with the world – the fact that the value of its imports greatly exceeds that of its exports – as evidence of unfairness.“Closed markets” overseas reduce US exports, while “open markets at home result in significant imports”, the White House notice said, arguing that this had undercut the US’s ability to compete.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS politicsUS economyInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.”Starbucks has a long history of inclusivity and diversity initiatives. The company began several programs in 2018 after thehigh-profile arrestof two Black men at a store in Philadelphia, includingclosing 8,000 US storesfor a day for employees to undergo racial-bias training.The federal lawsuit comes at a time when the Trump administration is pressuring governmental agencies to slash their DEI initiatives, and corporations across the country are following Trump’s example.The Starbucks spokesperson confirmed that there have been no changes to the company’s programming or benefits.“Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time,” it said.Explore more on these topicsStarbucksMissouriUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Mitsubishi was unlikely to participate, reports said.“Going forward, the three companies will collaborate within the framework of a strategic partnership aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles,” the trio said in a statement.The key China market and the car industry in general have been upended by the rapid rise of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers such as BYD. Nissan andHonda, like other carmarkers, are facing the prospect of tariffs in the US, another major market.Nissan is pushing ahead with a restructuring plan, announced in November, that includescutting 9,000 jobs and reducing global capacity by 20%. It has yet to disclose details such as which locations will be affected.The announcement will cause uncertainty for the company’s 130,000-strong workforce. However, it is thought the UK factory inSunderlandis unlikely to be affected.Before announcing the merger discussions in December, Nissan and Honda had been holding separate talks on a technology collaboration, which they could outline the scope of later on Thursday.Nissan is now open to working with new partners, with Taiwan’s Foxconn seen as one candidate, Reuters reported last week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most likely Tesla model was the Cybertruck, the company’s electric pickup, given Musk’s claims that the vehicle is bulletproof.However, a spokesperson for the department said the document was incorrect, and should have been a generic entry reading “electric vehicle manufacturer”. The department said the order was on hold.Nevertheless, the listing raises the possibility of more conflicts of interest for Musk, who is one of the biggest beneficiaries of US government contracts through the companies he controls.Musk’s stake in Tesla accounts for the bulk ofhis $383bn wealth, but his rocket company, SpaceX, is the most important contractor providing space launch services to the US government.Yet Trump has also put Musk in charge of the so-called department of government efficiency, or Doge, its name deriving from an internet dog meme. Musk has set about gutting government departments that he has accused – without providing substantiated evidence – of huge amounts of fraud and waste. Doge’s efforts have beencriticised as illegal by many experts, who have said it is part of a string of actions by the Trump administration that appear to disregard the US constitution.Musk appeared to confirm the procurement plans on Thursday in a post on X, the social network he also owns, although he suggested that the sum the company could receive may be lower. Other contractors could be involved in upgrading vehicles, depending on the level of protection required.Musk wrote: “I’m pretty sure Tesla isn’t getting $400m. No one mentioned it to me, at least.”Musk was asked about the possibility of conflicts of interest on Tuesday, before the revelation of the proposed armoured vehicle spending. Speaking to reporters in the White House’s Oval Office, he dismissed those concerns, claiming that his actions in cutting government spending were transparent.“All of our actions are fully public,” Musk said when asked about conflicts of interest. “So if you see anything like, ‘Elon, there may be a conflict there,’ it’s not like people are going to be shy about it. They are going to say it immediately.”The Department of State forecast document suggested the Tesla contract would be awarded at the end of September. It listed the procurement as in the “planning” phase.The government spokesperson said the previous administration under Joe Biden had put out a request for armoured electric vehicles, but only one unnamed company had responded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the spokesperson said the solicitation was on hold and there were no plans to issue it.The department website contains two versions of the forecast document.

That was a month after Trump’s election, but before he took office.However,another versionshowed the entry was “modified” on Wednesday evening, apparently after the procurement was first reported by Drop Site News, an independent outlet. That entry was identical to the previous version except that the reference to “Tesla” was removed. Instead, it said the department would procure “armoured electric vehicles”, without referencing a brand name.The US government regularly procures armoured vehicles. The same procurement document contained entries for an “armoured sedan” and “armoured EV (not sedan)” made by unnamed manufacturers, plus “armoured BMW X5/X7”. Those contracts were valued at $50m, $40m and $40m respectively.Tesla was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsTeslaTrump administrationElon MuskUS foreign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward.”Rodgers joined the Jets in 2023 with many believing his veteran experience could take a talented young team to the next level. But his campaign ended on the first drive of the first game of the seasonwhen he tore his achillestendon. The 41-year-old returned for 2024 but the Jets slumped to a 5-12 record, fired their head coach,were dogged by reportsthat owner Woody Johnson’s teenage son Brick had a say in team decisions and missed the playoffs for a 14th successive season. Rodgers’s QBR of 48.1ranked him 25thamong qualified NFL quarterbacks.In his farewell statement to Rodgers, Johnson said Rodgers “embodied” the Jets, a description that could be read a number of different ways, given the team’s record over the last decade.“I personally want to thank Aaron for his time at theNew York Jets,” Johnson said in a statement. “His arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From day one, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans, and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here. He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next.”Rodgers’s struggles with the Jets were a stark contrast to his career with the Green Bay Packers, where he won a Super Bowl and built a reputation as one of the most talented quarterbacks inNFLhistory.The future is murky for both Rodgers and the Jets. Rodgers is far removed from the quarterback who was once the most feared in theNFL, and he has indicated he may choose to retire. The Jets are left with the 35-year-old Tyrod Taylor as the only quarterback on their roster with any significant experience as a starter. They are unlikely to find a solution with the No 7 pick in this year’s draft, which is not considered a strong class for quarterbacks.Explore more on these topicsAaron RodgersNew York JetsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Don’t expect them to put it outLee EscobedoGiving up on their best player was bad enough, but Dallas’ handling of the aftermath has been woeful and left fans fumingThu 13 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 06.02 ESTShareTheDallas Mavericksare on fire.Luka Dončić, now a Los Angeles Laker,is never coming back, that much is certain. Not after the organization, led by team governor Patrick Dumont and general manager Nico Harrison, has spent the last 10 days post-trade disparaging hisability, weight, and work ethic. And the front office’s disconnect is starkly illustrated by their apparent failure to grasp the profound civic and cultural significance of Dončić in Dallas.Dončić’s trade to the Lakers has been described asthe most shocking, and perhaps worst, in NBA history. Harrison, a mostly unknown name in hoops circles before the trade (even in Dallas), is now public enemy No 1 for Mavs fans.Even the most dysfunctional franchises know not to trade a 25-year-old megastar, fresh off a finals run, who speaks to fans in multiple languages and bought a house in the city where he had played his entire career. Just two years ago,Harrison decided to loseKristaps Porziņģis for a bag of chips and, even worse, Jalen Brunson for nothing. Harrison was seen as an upgrade over former general manager Donnie Nelson, who the base felt failed to build properly around Dončić. Mavs fans were at first fairly apologetic for Harrison’s missteps, blaming then owner Mark Cuban. But this month, whenHarrison took full responsibilityfor sending Dončić to the Lakers, it was apparent the former Nike executive was a shoe salesman out of his element. The trade destroyed Mavericks culture, the team’s relationship with their fans, any chance of a return to the NBA finals. Most significantly, it ended the Dončić-era in Dallas. The Mavs were praised for their seamless handoff from a hall of famer, Dirk Nowitzki, to a future one in Dončić. That link between the past and a bright future is gone.It would be silly to suggest things were perfect when Dončić was still a Maverick. Cuban had well-chronicled issues when he ran the team. He was often too involved and trusted the wrong people (for example,Haralabos Voulgaris,Chandler ParsonsandJason Lutin). And he deserves some blame for the current mess: he was the one who hired Harrison in 2021. He also chose to sell 72.3% of the team to Miriam Adelson, the fifth-richest woman in America, and her family for $3.5bn in 2023. Adelson, one of thecountry’s most controversial figures, is an ardent lobbyist for Israel, an enemy of Palestine and a top financial donor to Donald Trump. Adelson, the mother-in-law of Dumont, is wildly unpopular among large sections of the Mavericks fanbase because of the Dončić trade but also due to rumors she intends to tank the team as leverage tomove the franchise to Las Vegas, where Adelson has ties, to build a casino complex and stadium.The Luka Dončić-Anthony Davis trade is shocking, franchise-altering and bizarreRead moreSo, yes, Cuban does not get a free pass. But one thing is for sure: he would have never traded Dončić, once saying: “If I had to choose between my wife and keeping Luka on the Mavs, catch me at my lawyer’s office prepping for a divorce.”That’s because for all his faults, he understood what the team, Nowitzki and Dončic meant toDallas. At his heart, he’s a fan, a part of #MFFL, the hashtag that denotes loyalty to the team for ever. The same sentiment etched in stone at the Nowitzki statue outside.But instead of Cuban, we have Adelson, Dumont and Harrison, who have set the Dallas sports world ablaze with a single trade. The PR efforts and explanations aren’t working either. Every press conference, interview andTim MacMahon ESPN monologueonly stirs up fans, who have shown their fury in chants,tweets,video montagesandprotests outside the American Airlines Center.If you wanted to give the Mavericks ownership and front office a backhanded compliment, they have achieved something impressive. In an NFL city, they’ve managed to steal attention away from the Cowboys, America’s Team and the most valuable sports franchise in the world. But for all the wrong reasons.But while Dallas is a football city, Dončic helped turn the tide somewhat with his on-the-court joie de vivre. It’s why Dallas made excuses and didn’t riot when the team lost Brunson for nothing, only to watch him become a megastar in New York. At least they had the Slovenian wunderkind who, as long as he was on the floor, gave them a chance to win any game, against any opponent, on any night. Now he is gone in a trade that saw Harrison only deal with one other team, rather than seeing what he could get from the wider market. No wonder all they got back was a first-round draft pick, Max Christie, a player with good two-way potential but nowhere near Dončic’s talent, and Anthony Davis. Davis is a fine player – like Dončić a future hall of famer – but he is 31 and even more injury prone than the Slovenian. In his first gam for the Mavs, Davis was great – recording a 26 points and 16 rebounds – but he picked up an injury and willmost likely be out for a month. So much for trading Dončić because of fitness issues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ramifications of the trade will also haunt Mavs fans for the foreseeable future, as trauma usually does. Considering the future, Harrison gave up draft capital control between 2027 and 2030 for players brought in to fit around Dončic. The real poverty era will start in 2027, when Davis, Kyrie Irving and Klay Thompson are all over 34, past their prime, and the team can’t depend on the draft to replenish top talent.The organization’s attempt at censorship has only widened the wounds. During Monday night’s game, the Mavs showed fans on the jumbotron for the first time since the trade. Until then, they feared what fans would do when the cameras were on. During a karaoke montage, a fan mouthed “Fire Nico.”He was kicked out minutes later. Two other fanswere kicked outafter calling for Harrison’s firing and Cuban told them to “sit the fuck down”. The second incident was caught on camera and widely shared on social media. For many fans it was the perfect visual metaphor for the team’s descent into a draconian state, one where the minority owner feels comfortable enough to cuss out fans for voicing dissent (for his part, Cuban said he did not swear until the fans shouted and pointed at him, and he did not ask for them to be removed). Dumont was not spared either. When he returned to his seat after half-time, he was booed mercilessly. Harrison has been absent from his regular seats at the Mavericks but obviously though he could find some peace watching local college team SMU play Pitt. Hewas duly booed by SMU fans.Harrison was fortunate enough to inherit Dončić, Brunson and Porziņģis when he took over. None of them remain. He fumbled all three, letting them go for a pittance in return. Nelson’s 2018 draft masterpiece – landing both Dončić (in a deal with Atlanta) and Brunson (with the 33rd pick!) – should be a contender for the bestNBAdraft ever. Instead, it has become a tragic tale of squandered potential thanks to Harrison’s mismanagement. Once a mecca for Mavs fans to express their jubilation, the AAC has become an empty, oppressive shell. Fans who have expressed discontent have been thrown out. Arena employees aren’t allowing shirts, signs or imagery criticizing the team through the entrance. The one metric Mavs fans always pointed to in their defense against being a poorly run franchise – Dončić – is gone.Dallas fans’ anger will continue to burn until the franchise acknowledges their pain, a move unlikely ever to come. After all, if ownership hasn’t cared about pushback over funding Trump orsupporting the Israeli governmentduring a genocide, why would it give two damns about Mavericks fans?Explore more on these topicsDallas MavericksNBADallasBasketballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

He was speaking in relation to Abdoulaye Doucouré’s provocative celebrations in front of the Liverpool support. Liverpool’s loss of control before the final whistle, however, was not normal for an Arne Slot team, though it also fuelled the anger that exploded on their final trip across Stanley Park.There was comfort amidthe mayhemof the last Merseyside derby at Goodison for Liverpool in the form of a seven-point lead over striker-less Arsenal at the top of the Premier League. There were also questions to be asked of Liverpool’s second successive below-par performance at the home of their oldest rivals. The visitors at least departed with a valuable point on this occasion but deserved no more, however much the manner ofJames Tarkowski’s 98th-minute equaliserstung.The great escapism: Everton’s Corner Flag Guy and football’s lasting capacity for joy | Max RushdenRead moreDavid Moyes’s Everton repeated what Sean Dyche’s Everton did to Liverpool in thecorresponding fixture last seasonin terms of refusing to let their rivals settle in possession, cutting off their passing lanes and bombarding their penalty area at the earliest opportunity. Liverpool suffered again, losing composure in their feet long before losing it in their heads. Alexis Mac Allister’s and Mohamed Salah’s goals followed rare moments of controlled, patient approach work by Slot’s team. The style that has underpinned Liverpool’s march on the Premier League title needs to be rediscovered before four key games in 11 days against Wolves, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Newcastle.Liverpool had only six attempts on Jordan Pickford’s goal on Wednesday, with four on target. It was their lowest tally in a Premier League game this season and the fewest since having four against Manchester City in April 2023. Everton had 10 attempts, three on target, and that with an attack featuring only one fit striker in Beto and options that pale in comparison with the resources at Slot’s disposal.The lack of composure in the Liverpool performance, from the off, was exacerbated by the 64 long balls they played. It was their joint-highest total of the season and played to the strengths of anEvertondefence featuring the towering trio of Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite and Jake O’Brien. Ryan Gravenberch’s usually telling influence was nullified and the Liverpool midfielder was withdrawn in the 61st minute.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah’s goal followed one of Liverpool’s few cohesive passages of play.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/Shutterstock‘We all know we could have played better,” Van Dijk said. “But you play against a team who we all know this is their game of the season. We’ve seen it over the years. Coming here is always difficult and the way they play they make it uncomfortable for you – long balls, second-ball fights, balls that just fall in the right position – and you have to be ready to work your socks off. At times we matched it quite good and other times we couldn’t do it. Overall I think we definitely could have done better but you are still playing against a team who has strength in the way they played and we have to adapt to that.”Liverpool and Everton unite to condemn racist abuse of Abdoulaye DoucouréRead moreLiverpool’s temperament was stretched by the referee, Michael Oliver, before Doucouré provided the tipping point. Both teams, however, had legitimate reasons to lament the official’s inconsistent display. Both teams should also be thankful that red cards were not shown before the final whistle, as they might have been in the hands of a weaker referee swayed by their antics.Slot’s cool demeanour evaporated in the heat of his first Merseyside derby. He cut an agitated figure throughout a contest in which Liverpool conceded 20 fouls, another season high. He had analysed last season’s Goodison derby, pinpointed the number of cheap fouls that Liverpool conceded as a factor in their defeat and appealed for cool heads, but his advice on how to avoid a repeat went ignored. Oliver was not entirely responsible for that.But Van Dijk said: “I think the ref, and I told the ref, didn’t have it under the control we wanted. Some fouls were easily given and some weren’t. In the end these moments are decisive and for Doucouré to provoke the fans triggers [us] and that is absolutely normal. For Curt [Curtis Jones] to get a red, and everyone is jumping on it, in that case is a normal thing. I tried to stay calmer and get everyone away because I know how much we need everyone on Sunday but when the ref gives the manager and assistant coach a red as well that’s a bit strange.“Conceding a goal in the last seconds of a game, or even after added time of a game, is very difficult. I think it was already over time, that was my view, and in my opinion it was a foul on Ibou [Konaté]. That hurt and should hurt for each one of us but it is the reality. You have two things you can do: you can dwell on it and stay angry about it or you can take it on board, start the recovery and be ready for Wolves because that will be a difficult test again. I think that’s the best thing to do.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolEvertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The whole place smells like movie-theater popcorn, sticky spilled soda, and, vaguely, sweat. The cheerleaders jumping up and down on the court, attempting to amp up the somewhat sleepy crowd, look like they could pass for middle schoolers. This is, in unmistakable and almost caricatured fashion, a college campus. But there’s a certain player on the floor, with an oversized bulbous bun atop her head, who is sparkling a little differently than everyone around her. She moves so fluidly, gets to her spots on the floor with such ease. It’s, frankly, just so very clear that she is operating in a different echelon than her peers. Even if you didn’t tell me JuJu Watkins was a budding superstar, I’d know it.A college coach returned to work a week after giving birth. Was it too soon?Read moreThis year in particular, JuJu (government name: Judea Skies) Watkins’ stardom is markedly transitioning from bud to full bloom. You’d be hard-pressed to find a stretch of road in Los Angeles without the USC sophomore’s image on a Nike billboard, or a commercial block during a national NBA broadcast withouther State Farm ad spot. With Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese having moved onto the WNBA last year, she’s arguably the biggest remaining name in college basketball, men’s or women’s, and her resumé is already impressive: Gatorade National Player of the Year, McDonald’s All-American Game MVP, Unanimous First-Team All American, WBCA Freshman of the Year, the list goes on and on.When Watkins, from the south Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, declared in fall 2022 that she would be attending her hometown USC, it was a seismic moment in college sports. The Trojans’ women’s basketball program had fallen out of favor with recruits, and out of relevancy, since winning back-to-back national championships during the mid-80s. They hadn’t even reached the Sweet Sixteen since 1994. But Watkins wasn’t afraid of the challenge to revive the legacy established by players like Cheryl Miller and Lisa Leslie, and her arrival immediately proved impactful. The first female high school athlete to sign a deal with Nike lived up to every bit of the hype and did so immediately. She finished second in the nation in points per game (27.1) her first season, behind only Clark, while leading the Trojans to the Pac-12 tournament title and theirfirst Elite Eight appearance in 30 years. Seemingly overnight, USC’s reputation as a college basketball powerhouse and destination for high-school talent had been restored.View image in fullscreenJuJu Watkins helped the Trojans to their first Elite Eight appearance in 30 years during her first season at USC.Photograph: Steph Chambers/Getty ImagesWatkins’ off-court persona is almost disarmingly unassuming; she’s incredibly soft-spoken and carries herself with the calm and aura of someone well beyond her 19 years. We bond over shared music taste: she loves Steve Lacy, Faye Webster and Clairo (she lists Terrapin as her favorite song, a deep cut sure to impress even the most discerning of music snobs).A self-described “introvert”, living in the immense spotlight she’s accumulated over the past couple of years has come with a sharp learning curve. “I think one of the crazier things is just being home and going to places you go to all the time, and slowly realizing that people are starting to notice you more. It’s a blessing and a curse, but it’s cool,” she says, as we chat during her bus ride to a game in Wisconsin, of what has been the biggest adjustment to her newfound notoriety. “The luxury of living in LA is people encounter like, you know, I wouldn’t sayfamous, but people like that all the time,” she says. “So I think for me it’s more chill, compared to when we travel to other places. I walk around with my headphones on, going to class like a regular student.”She’s decidedlynota regular student, though she is still in college (I joke that she’s living a Hannah Montana existence, which elicits a chuckle), but Watkins doesn’t seem fazed by the life disruption, understanding that it’s a package deal with both following her own dreams, and helping to further the growth of the sport she loves. “I just live my life,” she shrugs. “I have crazy experiences, but I think it’s honestly cool, it’s just a testament to where women’s basketball is going, and I think it helps grow the sport.”View image in fullscreenWatkins has blossomed into one of LA’s brightest and most recognizable young sports stars.Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesAnd the sport is growing exponentially. I ask her what she makes of all the national attention women’s basketball has gotten over the last year or so, with the rise of Clark, Reese and a host of other young talent elevating the profile of the WNBA. “It’s definitely well-deserved, I think. A long time coming for women’s sports and women’s basketball specifically,” she says. “I’m just grateful to be in this space at this time. Because honestly, I think timing is everything. And to be in college basketball now ... it’s just super different. In a good way.”I ask Watkins, who says she started to take basketball “seriously” at the ripe old age of 12, how she keeps her feet on solid ground when it feels like she’s surrounded by a storm of attention and flashbulbs at all times. “I’m grateful to have my family. I think they definitely keep me grounded,” she says. “And then, I think, just kind of having my own space. I’m introverted, so whenever the world kind of feels like it’s going crazy, I’ll just go to my couch and watch my show”–that show is currently Severance, she says–“and just kind of tune everything out. But ‘grounded’ is super easy for me, because it’s just how I was raised.”On Thursday night, Watkins and the sixth-ranked Trojans will host the UCLA Bruins,the No 1 team in the countryfor 12 straight weeks and the last undefeated team in major college basketball. Thehype around the game, the first of two highly anticipated matchups between the crosstown rivals, is a true testament to the turnaround that Watkins’ presence in the Los Angeles basketball scene has spearheaded. Between her generational talent and her impressively down-to-earth attitude, Watkins is destined for a skyward ascension. College superstardom is just the beginning.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It will also seemingly open up a direct line of competition between the organization and MLS, years after the two ended their strategic partnership that saw many MLS reserve teams playing in USL leagues.Again in the margins at Dortmund, Gio Reyna in danger of being an ‘eternal prospect’Read moreSpeaking to the Guardian, though, USL president and chief soccer officer Paul McDonough insisted that the league’s incoming creation is purely for its own ambitions.“I don’t think of it as a threat to the MLS,” he said. “I think we’re just gonna go and do our business.”With roots in the Wild West of late-80s American soccer, the USL has undergone numerous shifts in identity and strategy. For the last 25 years, though, it has mostly administered lower-division leagues. On the men’s side, it comprises 38 professional teams in the USL Championship and League One, with a further 128 semi-pro or amateur teams playing regionally in League Two. Clubs in these leagues operate differently from MLS clubs in that they are independent, which McDonough says enables them to have drastically different business models depending on their location and ambition. Some clubs, like Orange County SC, focus on player development. Others, like Louisville City, aim to give fans as professional an experience as possible. Last year marked a major milestone, with the USL Championship final being broadcast on CBS and drawing a league-record viewership of 431,000.Among the main reasons cited by McDonough for starting a new D-I competition is the USL’s belief that the United States is big enough geographically to sustain more professional teams. Europe, he pointed out, contains over 400 professional Division men’s I teams in an area comparable in size to the United States, which only has the 30 served by MLS. There are obvious differences there: Europe’s 400 top-flight teams play in in separate countries’ league systems, and the population of the continent is more than double that of the United States. However, McDonough is focused more on how such a saturation of pro teams creates a soccer culture and would “grow the game” in the Unites States.“This is about us and it’s about us building a higher tier because we wanna be in certain communities,” he said. “Why can’t it be in middle America and smaller communities, why can’t Division I teams be there and be successful?”The other reason for the new league is internal: The USL has ambitions to complete a unified league structure that covers nearly every level of American pro and semi-pro soccer. This too would bring the league in line with national European circuits, but with another key difference: McDonough says there are no immediate plans to institute a system of promotion and relegation into the USL portfolio,which would be a first in modern US soccer history.“We’ve always stated our ambition to get there, but it’s a little bit more complicated in this ecosystem,” he said. “If the opportunity arises for us to do it, then we’ll do it.”Asked whether D-I status would open the possibility of USL teams competing in the Concacaf Champions Cup, McDonough said “I hope so…I don’t want us to be excluded from any opportunities if it’s good for [the clubs] and they can grow to help grow the game in this country.”This won’t be the USL’s first go at starting a league that shares D-I status. Last year saw the launch of the women’s USL Super League that shares D-I status with the NWSL but differentiates itself in part by playing a fall-to-spring schedule like most European leagues. A USL spokesperson said the organization has no current plans to switch its men’s competitions to a fall-to-spring schedule.The composition of the new league is still up in the air; current USL team owners were only informed of plans for the new competition on Wednesday night, with a public statement is set to be released on Thursday morning. The USL expects certain existing teams, especially those in the Championship, to make the step up, but will also soon be in conversations with multiple potential new owners. According to the United States Soccer Federation’s D-I standards, those owners must meet certain financial criteria: A principal owner with at least a 35% stake in the team whose net worth is at least $40m, and/or a group of owners whose combined net worth is at least $70m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the chance for new investors to snap up MLS teams may be dwindling as two decades of rapid expansion comes to a close – the league boasts 30 teams, and has not firmly committed to adding any more. An entry in a new USL D-I league is also likely to be significantly cheaper than the $500m paid by the most recent MLS entrant San Diego.Among many other requirements, USSF standards dictate that the USL’s new league must have at least 12 teams to begin play in D-I, and must expand to at least 14 by year three of its existence. These teams will need to come from across the country, with at least 75% of them serving metro areas of at least 1m people. In addition, every team in the league must play in a stadium that seats at least 15,000 people.McDonough said the league made the USSF aware of its plans, and got a receptive response.“I think US Soccer is in a mode right now where they want soccer to grow in this country, and I think if we execute it well, they don’t have a problem with it,” he said. “Now we have to go out and we have to implement it.”US Soccer told the Guardian in a statement that “We welcome innovation and growth to the landscape of American soccer, and we look forward to learning more.”Explore more on these topicsUSL ChampionshipUS sportsMLSnewsShareReuse this content"

With the new season beginning next month, the British driver said he relished the chance to take on the Dutchman and was confident with the right machinery he could stamp his authority on a challenge for the title.Norris, who was second behind Verstappen last season, taking four wins, was speaking at the unveiling of hisMcLarenteam’s new challenger for 2025, the MCL39. At Silverstone, where he drove the car for the first time during a promotional filming day, the 25-year-old insisted he would face down Verstappen’s uncompromising style.“I need to get my elbows out, need to show him that I am not going to willingly give him any positions,” he said. “But I am also going to be a smart driver.”‘Best feelings of my life’: Lewis Hamilton makes test debut for new team FerrariRead moreLast year McLaren challenged Verstappen and Red Bull after upgrades deployed at the Miami GP proved to be enormously effective and whereNorris took his debut F1 win.He fought Verstappen for the title but was unable to overcome the points advantage the Dutchman had amassed early in the season.The two went wheel to wheel with one another repeatedly, notably in Austria, Austin and Mexico, with the Dutchman firm in his approach, including controversially forcing Norris off track. However the British driver has also admitted that he made mistakes.“There’s some things where I just didn’t do a good enough job,” he said. “I wasn’t simply quite at the level that I need to be to race against Max, but when we’re talking about that, we’re talking about probably going up against one of the hardest attacking-defence guys you can ever go up against.”Norris, who is entering his seventh season in F1 this year, was nonetheless confident in the lessons learned from 2024 he knew what it would take to challenge Verstappen.“You have to be a smart driver to go up against Max, so I look forward to it,” he said. “I like those moments when you have to make those quick decisions, and it’s always a lot harder when you’re in the car than when you re-watch it after and you think: ‘why the hell have I done that, what an idiot’.”“At the same time, I don’t need to go out and prove something to him. I don’t need to take any unnecessary risks, and I don’t need to go down trying. I don’t think you have to do anything special to try and beat Max. You have to be smart and also think of the long game sometimes.”View image in fullscreenLando Norris is held aloft by the McLaren team after his maiden F1 win in Miami last year.Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APNorris and his teammate, the Australian Oscar Piastri, did return consistently strong results last season ensuring McLaren took theirfirst constructors’ championship for 26 years.The team principal, Andrea Stella, who has been instrumental in returning McLaren to the sharp end of the grid, was confident the British driver was ready to fight for the title if they deliver a competitive car.“He definitely has all the qualities, the skills, the mindset to become a world champion,” he said. “I have seen Lando growing through [last] season at a very fast rate. He was already an incredible driver and he showed it immediately in Miami as soon as he had the car to win in, he delivered. He has been a very consistent driver, look at the number of podiums and points scored, he scored as much as Max from Miami onwards.”Last season with Norris in position to challenge Verstappen in the latter stages, McLaren did employ team orders on Piastri to favour the British driver but Stella reiterated the team would open the season once more on a level playing field, allowing them to race.“I look forward to having this kind of challenge, it means we are doing well as a team, the drivers are doing well, and the car is competitive and we did a good job,” he said. “In terms of how we will manage that, we start with equal opportunities with our racing principles and good talks with our drivers.”McLaren will reveal the new season’s livery, alongside the other nine teams, at the F1 75 showcase event to be held in London next Tuesday. Testing will take place in Bahrain on 26-28 February with the season opener in Melbourne on 16 March.Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisMcLarenFormula OneMotor sportMax VerstappenRed BullnewsShareReuse this content"

Either way, he was healthy and happy for the first time in a while, after his half-season loan to Nottingham Forest had been a bust. He was still only 21 but seemed to have matured. He had just gotten engaged. The beef with US national team coach Gregg Berhalter was behind him –that whole sordid dealwhen Gio’s parents sparked a civil war within American soccer with ugly allegations against Berhalter around the 2022 World Cup.He had dazzled, finally reemerging as the Reyna of old, at the Concacaf Nations League Finals in March, where he was named player of the tournament after guiding the US to a third straight title. He seemed perfectly positioned to make his mark on the Copa América. Instead the tournamentturned into a debacle for the US. Reyna played plenty, but the host country eventually faced a group-stage elimination-cum-humiliation.Nine months later, Reyna is back to the same place where he has spent so much of his five years as a first-team professional: playing marginal minutes atBorussia Dortmund. At a big club, but not quite big-time. Almost breaking through but never exactly getting the timing or the opportunities right. Threatening to become, as the Dutch call it, an “eternal prospect.”Dortmund’s season is spiralling out of control after own goals on and off pitch | Andy BrassellRead moreRemember the 2020-21 season, when Reyna, who turned 18 that year, formed an effervescent foursome of forwards with a few other hot prospects? Those colleagues: Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland and Jadon Sancho. That feels like a long time ago.On Saturday, Reyna substituted into Dortmund’s dreary 2-1 loss to Stuttgart in the 85th minute, just before Julian Ryerson was sent off and reduced the home side to 10 men. Reyna had six touches in the late chaos as he and his teammatesdesperately tried to arrest their downward spiral. This came a week after his previous appearance, when he played all of four minutes and communed with the ball only four times after coming on in the 88th minute at Heidenheim. He has made just one Bundesliga start this season and logged 175 minutes – on a team that has faceplanted to 11th place with a what-is-gong-on-here goal difference of +1.On Tuesday, in Dortmund’s 3-0 dismantling of Sporting in the first leg of theirChampions Leagueknockout phase playoffs, Reyna didn’t play at all. He was seen jogging along the sideline and joining in on the goal celebrations of others.Time is a flat circle, it seems. A flash of brilliance. An injury. A dearth of playing time. And on and on. But the connective tissue in his still-pretty-young career has been less untapped potential than plain bad luck. If there were some advanced metric that correlated talent to misfortune, Reyna might be one of the world’s leading players in the category – enough that we might call this new stat xGio.Over the course of the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons alone, Reynamissed 386 days to 10 different injuries– more than a year in all. The start of his 2023-24 season was derailed by a hairline fracture in his fibula that cost him the first month of the season. This season, a groin strain ruled him out from early September through late November, a 13-game stretch. It’s become something of a tradition: spending the fall, and the crucial opening months of the new campaign, beset by injuries.The upshot is as predictable as the cadence of muscle problems – because other than the break in his shin, Reyna’s injuries tend to be hamstring or groin issues. By the time Reyna is back to full fitness, he is buried deep down the depth chart in all of the various attacking positions he can play, since Dortmund develop wingers and attacking midfielders on an industrial scale. If he has a role at all, it’s most often been as a super sub. The most minutes Reyna has played for Dortmund since his high mark of 2,698 minutes in 2020-21 is a mere 1,016 minutes, back in 2022-23.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the five years and a few weeks since Reyna made hisBundesligadebut, Dortmund have made six managerial changes – tellingly appointing Edin Terzić ad interim once and permanently twice. Judging from his first two matches in charge, Niko Kovač, the new man in charge, isn’t inclined to lean heavily on Reyna just yet.It’s the same kind of unfortunate timing that fairly ruined Reyna’s first World Cup. In all that time he was out injured, Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah established themselves as Berhalter’s nailed-down starters on the wings. Meanwhile, the midfield trio of Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah and Tyler Adams became so coherent and incontrovertible that it earned a collective nickname, MMA. Midfields with a moniker don’t get broken up. Reyna was left out of the lineup for the business end of that cycle. His frustration at the World Cup turned to petulance, which unleashed all that drama.Coaches tend to come around to Reyna eventually. Kovač may yet. But until such a time, Reyna appears to be the wrong man at the wrong place and the wrong time, having to start over.

This season, the Dutch side’s home ground De Kuip has seen its bestChampions Leaguenights in decades and that trend continued as Milan, who included former Feyenoord hero Santiago Giménez in their lineup, were beaten 1-0. This was Feyenoord’s first knockout stage win at this level since defeating Coleraine in the 1974-75 European Cup. Igor Paixão’s early goal against Milan owed much to poor goalkeeping from Mike Maignan but the Brazilian was forever in the vanguard of his team’s attacks. Will Bosschaart be in charge for the second leg? Erik ten Hag has been linked with the vacancy.Borussia DortmundAnother club finding success under fresh management were Dortmund, though Niko Kovač, once of Bayern Munich, and recently sacked by Wolfsburg, has many miles on the clock. Sporting, themselves on a third manager of the season, were given a 3-0 home pounding by a team belying their Bundesliga form. Pascal Gross, beloved at Brighton, less productive in Westphalia, scored his first Dortmund goal on a night when Serhou Guirassy scored and supplied an assist, with Julian Brandt also setting up two goals. Gio Reynahad to sit out the night on the bench. As was the case last season, the Champions League continues to be BVB’s shelter from Bundesliga disappointments.Again in the margins at Dortmund, Gio Reyna in danger of being an ‘eternal prospect’Read moreClub BruggeIf the competition’s expansion was supposed to allow more light on to the continent’s lesser leagues then the Belgian club have helped fulfill that promise. Atalanta were beaten 2-1 in Bruges, and if last season’s Europa League winners have every right to complain about the penalty for Brugge’s second goal, Nicky Hayen’s team had fought for every ball to get to that point. They can play, too. As the likes of Celtic, Aston Villa, Juventus and Manchester City found out in the group stage, Brugge are no pushovers. Brugge may, though, fear a second leg in Bergamo. Atalanta wereenraged by that late penalty, awarded after Isak Hien barely grazed Gustaf Nilsson’s nose with his trailing arm.View image in fullscreenLife isn’t getting much better for Manchester City.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHeading downManchester CitySo much is coming back to haunt City at the moment, not least Real Madrid, who wereexultant 3-2 winners in Manchesteron Tuesday night. Oh, for a recording of the conversations between Pep Guardiola and right-hand man Juanma Lillo as things fall apart. The song remains the same at City: Erling Haaland gaveone of his best performancesbut still didn’t touch the ball enough as those around him continued to creak with age and overwork. Injury struck Jack Grealish and Manuel Akanji when both had been playing well. A recurrent theme of the season is talent City once shed coming good elsewhere and Brahim Díaz, never remotely a first-team prospect in Manchester, grabbed Real’s equaliser and performed that rather unnecessarynon-celebration celebration. Panic and doom have set in at the Etihad: City spent $223m in January and yet Guardiola didn’t trust any new signing to start.MilanConsidering the amount of business Milan did in January, it’s understandable that Sérgio Conceição’s team looked less than cohesive in Rotterdam. Kyle Walker, already sounding like a team leader, spoke afterwards: “If we don’t score goals it’s because we have to attack better as a team, we have to attack and defend all together.” A trio of Christian Pulisic, Rafael Leao and João Félix behind Giménez has potential to be thrilling but also infuriating. Pulisic lasted just 60 minutes, and Leao and Félix lived up their mercurial reputations. “Matches definitely become easier if you win duels,” said an unimpressed Conceição. Much better must come at San Siro.BrestThe darlings of the group stage were granted the worst possible knockout draw in the form of Paris Saint-Germain, who were easy 3-0 winners at Brest. PSG’s domestic supremacy was transferred to the continental stage as two-goal Ousmane Dembélé took his scoring feats to 18 in his last 10 appearances. Brest’s Éric Roy, who has emerged as one of the coaches of the season, entered the world of Gallic existentialism when explaining his team’s defeat: “If I can’t fault my team much in terms of spirit and desire to do things, we lacked realism. From that point on, you can’t exist against a great team.” Too many risks were taken with an attacking style Roy all but admitted would not have been used in Ligue 1. “It seems like mission impossible,” he said of the second leg.A good week forWeston McKennie (Juventus)As for goals of the week, look no further than McKennie’sthump from the edge of the penalty areathat started the scoring for Juve in their 2-1 defeat of PSV. A new Juve are taking shape and McKennie was playing in a high-press behind Randal Kolo Muani, the PSG loanee. Meanwhile, Timothy Weah was at full-back opposite Englishman Lloyd Kelly. Thiago Motta took a while to warm to McKennie but he has become a first-choice pick. The American modestly described his goal as “lucky,” adding: “My role is not important, I work for the team.”Anatomy of a Tifo: City’s Madrid jibe makes confused super club look small | Barney RonayRead moreVinícius Júnior (Real Madrid)When will clubs learn?City fans’ tifo mocking Vinilosing out to Rodri in the Ballon d’Or appeared only to inspire the player who could actually play a part in the game. As City’s midfield continued to collapse without Rodri, Vinícius was not at his best – Rodrygo probably played better – but was still decisive. His shot was blocked for Díaz’s equaliser, and his reading of Ederson’s charge set up Jude Bellingham for that tapped-in winner. “Whenever the opposing fans do things like that they give me more strength,” he said. City fans were left to “Stop Crying Your Heart Out” as the Oasis-inspired banner had said.Michael Olise (Bayern Munich)Rivalling McKennie’s goal for spectacle wasOlise’s effort on half-time at Celtic Park. Those who watched Olise in his Crystal Palace days will know the type, the cut inside and the thrash of the left foot. Olise is building a body of work for Bayern, and that goal, coming after a half in which Bayern weathered the expected Celtic storm but could not find a way through, will help him. The standards he must reach are high – those of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribéry – but he may well have the talent to get there. His fifth goal in this season’s Champions League already outstrips compatriot Ribéry’s campaign-best of four.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueFeyenoordReal MadridClub BruggeManchester CityJuventusBayern MunichfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 51-year-old was placed under formal investigation in France last Wednesday, in relation to a case surrounding a Paris-based media company, for alleged complicity in vote-buying, interference with the freedom to vote and complicity in abuse of power, as part of a wider case involving the businessman Arnaud Lagardère. Khelaifi denies wrongdoing.QSI sold a 12.5% stake in PSG to Arctos Sports Partners, an American investment group, in December 2023. That deal was framed as a means of bolstering the club’s ability to compete at European level and the ­Guardian understands QSI would entertain lessening its involvement as part of a wider move to focus on projects outside France.Khelaifi, whose other roles include the influential position of European Club Association chairman, is being investigated in connection with a complex case involving Lagardère Group, which had longstanding business interests in sport. It surrounds an internal power struggle in 2018 between the wealthy board members Vincent Bolloré and Bernard Arnault. The latter was a supporter of Arnaud Lagardère. The PSG chairman’s proximity owed to his role on the board of Qatar Investment Authority, whose subsidiary Qatar Holding LLC was the main shareholder of Lagardère Group.QIA had originally sided with resolutions tabled by Bolloré’s Amber Capital investment fund in the dispute. It is claimed that, five days after the Lagardère Group board held its first vote on the matter, QIA switched position and voted for governance resolutions put forward by Lagardère. He and his allies are alleged to have called contacts, including Khelaifi, before that change of heart.The investigation comes two and a half years after Khelaifi was cleared of corruption in a caseregarding World Cup media rights. He was also cleared in February 2023 after a corruption investigation into Qatar’s bid for the 2017 World Athletics Championships.Part of a QIA statement in reaction to the Lagardère case read: “Mr al-Khelaifi had no substantive role in this matter nor made any decisions in this regard. Day-to-day matters involving companies into which QIA has made an investment are handled by its executives, not by members of QIA’s board such as Nasser al-Khelaifi … Accordingly [al-Khelaifi] was not in any position to influence, or to take any action on behalf of, QIA involving the company Lagardère.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

SCR rules are operating in shadow form and the league had said it hoped to approve the measures before the end of this season.Premier League seeks power to access club premises during investigationsRead moreAt a shareholders’ meeting in London on Thursday, clubs expressed near-unanimous support for SCR but agreed the system should continue in trial form for now.Thismeans PSR will probably continuefor another full year despite the furore among supporters and clubs last season after a series of rulings led to Everton and Nottingham Forestbeing docked points.The change in pace comes as the league faces a number of legal challenges related to its rulebook. Manchester City havestarted a second legal actionagainst rules related to associated party transactions, and the Professional Footballers’ Association has warned of possible litigation if there were not greater consultation on SCR plans and related proposals on “anchoring” that would tie the amount top clubs could spend to revenues earned by the division’s last-placed side.Clubs were understood not to have raised the issue of potential legal fees in the shareholders’ meeting, but concern had previously been aired after the league revealed legal costs of £45m over the course of last season, a sum reported to have been six times greater than the proposed budget.As part of the SCR process, the league is to draft a collective position on how best to ensure financial sustainability among its clubs. This process is new and will be seen as a direct response to theproposed Independent Football Regulator, whose primary duty is to “promote financial stability” in English football. With legislation continuing to pass through the House of Lords, Conservative peers have recently argued a focus on sustainability may limit the ability of Premier League clubs to compete with their European rivals.The league, the Football Association and the referees’ body the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd (PGMOL) confirmed that semi-automated offside technologywill be trialledin English football during the fifth round of the FA Cup next month.As first reported by the Guardian, the system will be tested in the Cup with the hope of introducing it in league matches before the end of the season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

AfterWednesday’s 2-0 win at West Brom– without Eustace – Rovers are fifth with 14 games remaining. A return to the Premier League after 13 years remains a tantalising prospect.Championship: Argyle ride Cup fever to rout Millwall as Eustace joins DerbyRead moreMany were bemused at his decision to speak to Derby, not least at Ewood Park. Rovers said they were “extremely disappointed by Eustace’s request to hold discussions with another club at such a crucial stage of the season, but this has now been reluctantly granted”. In a statement on Thursday morning confirming their parting of ways, Rovers did not conceal their disdain for Derby’s approach, failing to mention the rival club by name.One of the biggest reasons for his move is simple: to be closer to his family in the Midlands. It is not difficult to see why Derby is appealing in that respect, particularly as Eustace has a connection to the club where he finished his playing career in 2015.Some may question Eustace’s commitment and loyalty, qualities the 45-year-old has demanded from his players since his appointment on a two-and-a-half-year contract. That Eustace has spent the past year living in a Blackburn hotel suggests he never envisaged staying long term, and no doubt made a potential return to the family home all the more inviting.Yet it seems bizarre that Rovers’ entire season could be derailed by Derby’s activation of the coach’s £500,000 release clause. Even in the Championship, players are hard to sign and sell but managers remain relatively cheap to sack and hire, something Eustace knows too well after he wasinexplicably replaced by Wayne Rooney at Birminghamin October 2023.View image in fullscreenMakhtar Gueye’s goal helped Blackburn to beat West Brom and move them fifth in the Championship but changing coach now risks all their hard work.Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/ShutterstockQuestions remain over the Rovers board and Venky’s, the club’s controversial owner, that has not had anyone at an Ewood Park game in more than a decade and remains under financial scrutiny in India with ongoing court battles. In September 2023 the Indian government seized assets worth £7.3m relating to the parent company of Venky’s purchase of a large house in Lancashire.Much has been made of Venky’s lack of spending on the first team, and a lack of transfer funds was another critical reason for Eustace’s departure. The manager spoke to the Blackburn board before opening talks with Derby, reportedly demanding guarantees over summer transfer budgets, and his move suggests no agreement was made. Investment has long been a problem at Rovers. Managers and fans have grown frustrated, particularly as money from significant player sales has been used to plug recent annual losses (more than £20m in 2023).Of the 48 clubs to playChampionshipfootball in the past 10 years, Blackburn are 45th in terms of expenditure on permanent transfers (and costs relating to free transfers), according to Transfermarkt. During that period, only Swansea have made more profit on selling players, with the figure close to £100m. Blackburn’s sales include Adam Wharton to Crystal Palace for £18m (a boyhood fan born in Blackburn), Adam Armstrong to Southampton for £15m, Sammie Szmodics (last season’s Championship top scorer) to Ipswich for £10m, Jordan Rhodes to Middlesbrough for £9m, Rudy Gestede to Aston Villa for £6m, Grant Hanley to Newcastle for £5.5m, Shane Duffy to Brighton for £4m, the academy product David Raya to Brentford for £3m (and a subsequent £3m sell-on clause when Raya joined Arsenal), Tom Cairney to Fulham for £3m and the Belgium international Thomas Kaminski to Luton for £2.5m.View image in fullscreenOf the 48 clubs to play Championship football in the past 10 years, Blackburn are 45th in terms of expenditure on permanent transfers.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThe only players Rovers have signed for more than £1.5m in that period are Sam Gallagher (sold in a cut-price deal to Stoke last summer), Ben Brereton Díaz (who joined Villarreal in 2023 on a free transfer), Armstrong and Szmodics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBrereton Díaz is one of a number of big names lost after bungled contract negotiations. Joe Rothwell (to Bournemouth), the then club captain Darragh Lenihan (to Middlesbrough) and Amari’i Bell (to Luton) have left for nothing in recent years. Rovers have not renewed a first-team contract since 2023 and regardless of whether they are promoted, this will be another summer of uncertainty. Thirteen of the 26 first-team players are out of contract or due to return to parent clubs.Along with contract debacles, there have been other embarrassing incidents. The Orlando City and US forward Duncan McGuire’s transfer to Rovers last year broke down owing to an “administrative error” in which the clubpressed the wrong buttonas they attempted to submit paperwork to the English Football League’s transfer system.After promotion-chasing seasons tailed off in recent years, Blackburn made six signings in January – a “significant investment”, according to the board (although three are loans and two deals until the end of the season). The captures of Augustus Kargbo from Cesana and Emmanuel Dennis on loan from Nottingham Forest appear astute business.For all the furore over Eustace’s departure, Rovers’ squad is well-stocked, largely injury-free and seems motivated to perform (if Wednesday at West Brom is anything to go by). “I’ve just spoken to Danny Batth, who I had at Sunderland, and he was talking about how the [Blackburn] team were galvanised by what has happened this week,” said West Brom’s coach, Tony Mowbray, who managed Blackburn from 2017-22. “Danny said it made the players really stick together and that they were really up for the game.”The dream of the Premier League is tangible and regardless of Blackburn’s problems, their league position should attract a high calibre of candidate. Steve Cooper, Gary O’Neil, Rob Edwards and the former Rovers players Lee Carsley and Damien Duff – who would be a gamble despiteguiding Shelbourne to a historic League of Ireland titlelast year – have been heavily linked. All eyes are on the Blackburn board. Their next appointment is a big one.Explore more on these topicsBlackburn RoversChampionshipDerby CountyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Confirmation thatKai Havertz is expectedto miss the rest of the season came 24 hours after Arsenal’s players returned from a warm-weather training camp in Dubai, with scans revealing the Germany striker had a torn hamstring.Having flown to the United Arab Emirates last week in an attempt to refresh his weary squad, Arteta has lost a third senior attacker to the same injury, Havertz joining Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli – who could be out for a month after limping out of the defeat by Newcastle in the Carabao Cup semi-final – on the sidelines. Gabriel Jesus is out until next season with ananterior cruciate ligament injury.Mikel Arteta must refocus Arsenal’s mammoth task after chastening exit | Ed AaronsRead moreArsenal said in a statement on Thursday that Havertz would have surgery “in the coming days” and his rehabilitation was “expected to extend into pre-season preparations”. Arteta has not hidden his disappointment that they were unable to bring in reinforcements in the January transfer window and could be forgiven for wondering what else could possibly have gone wrong in a season he had hoped would prove to see his side coming of age.Yet as the manager comes to terms with having only three fit senior forwards – Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and Ethan Nwaneri – available to face Leicester on Saturday, he must have contemplated whether he could have done things differently. It was interesting to note that neither of his two major summer signings, Riccardo Calafiori and Mikel Merino, started the5-1 thrashing of Manchester Cityin Arsenal’s most recent Premier League game, with Myles Lewis-Skelly excelling at left-back and Declan Rice thriving in the left midfield role. Although Calafiori and Merino have contributed on occasions, they have yet to establish themselves as first choices even as the injury list has mounted.A few days before Arsenal confirmed the signing of Merino from Real Sociedad at the end of August, Arteta admitted he was concerned about the lack of depth in his squad. “We don’t have 23 outfield players and normally you have to be equipped like that,” he said. “We know we’re not going to get there. We have to trust some academy players and make sure that we look after the ones that we have to be robust and play a lot of minutes. So far looking good, I’m happy.”He could not have foreseen the extent of Arsenal’s injuries, which began when Martin Ødegaard was ruled out for two months after returning from international duty in early September, but Arteta may be regretting the decision to allow Eddie Nketiah to join Crystal Palace three days after Merino’s arrival. He had already sanctioned the sale of Emile Smith Rowe, which combined with Nketiah’s departure brought in almost £60m for the two academy products, and allowed Reiss Nelson to join him at Fulham on loan. In what turned out to be Edu’s last signing before hissurprise departureas sporting director in November, Arsenal ended the transfer window with a late loan swoop for Sterling, who was unwanted at Chelsea.View image in fullscreenRaheem Sterling in action against Spurs last month. The out-of-form loan signing may be required to step up in the season’s run-inPhotograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe out-of-sorts England forward will get a chance to add to a paltry 216 Premier League minutes, Sterling having been substituted on all three of his starts. Arteta said last week that Sterling and Trossard were capable of playing through the middle and has earmarked Nwaneri as a future No 9 given the teenager’s ruthlessness in front of goal that has brought him seven goals in a breakthrough campaign.It would speak volumes about where Arsenal find themselves if a side with ambitions of overhauling Liverpool and becoming champions for the first time since Arsène Wenger’s Invincibles in 2004 were to rely on a 17-year-old who is not allowed to change in the first-team dressing room under the Premier League’s safeguarding regulations.The injuries to Havertz and Martinelli will increase the scrutiny on Arsenal’s decision to promote Edu’s deputy, Jason Ayto, to step into the breach. Despite thebotched attempt to sign Ollie Watkinsfor about £40m, Ayto is understood to remain in contention for the permanent role along with the club’s former midfielderTomas Rosicky and several other candidates. Arteta said last week there could be news “relatively quickly”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the meantime, Arteta must conjure up a plan that could even include a role for Nathan Butler-Oyedeji, a 22-year-old academy product yet to score a league goal after loans at Accrington and Cheltenham.He made his Arsenal debut in the Champions League against Dinamo Zagreb in January and has scored eight goals in 13 appearances for the under-21s this season. The winger Charles Sagoe Jr has returned from a loan with Shrewsbury and could be an option in a wide role having started in the Carabao Cup last season.But as Arteta pointed out when his sidesurrendered a 2-0 leadat home to Aston Villa last month on the same day that Darwin Núñez came off the bench to score two late goals for Liverpool at Brentford, there are moments that can define a season and Arsenal’s may have passed.Explore more on these topicsArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After almost every game, the Brighton head coach is asked about the performance of Carlos Baleba in central midfield and the answer is always similar.“We all know that Carlos has an impact on our game because of his physicality and his quality in possession and he proved it in an impressive way,” Hürzeler said after the Cameroon international returned from injury to inspire thecomeback victory over Chelseain the FA Cup on Saturday night. “He played very mature and we are happy to have him back.”From Bournemouth to Brighton, the Premier League’s middle class is booming | Jonathan WilsonRead moreIn Baleba’s absence, Brighton werethrashed 7-0 by Nottingham Foresta week earlier and showed how reliant they have become on the 21-year-old, who was signed from Lille as a replacement for Moisés Caicedo in August 2023. Baleba, having shown glimpses of his immense talent last season under Hürzeler’s predecessor, Roberto De Zerbi, has taken his game to another level and that has not gone unnoticed elsewhere. Brighton fended off several inquiries in January and are expecting a flurry of interest this summer from some of the Premier League’s big hitters and beyond. The price tag could exceed the £115m Chelsea paid for Caicedo.Enzo Maresca’s side are in town again on Friday night, meaning Baleba will have another chance to shine against opponents who provided himwith a first Premier League goalin September. That may not have been celebrated with the trademark backflip that Baleba has been performing since he was a winger at the prestigious École de Football des Brasseries in Douala, Cameroon, given that Brighton were 3-1 down (they went on to lose 4-2). But he was able to demonstrate the acrobatic skills in December against Fulham, albeit in another defeat.“I don’t need to train for it, it’s in my blood,” Baleba told Onze magazine shortly after he had joined Lille in January 2022. “I’ve been doing somersaults since I was little. After my first goal, I’m going to do a direct somersault.”View image in fullscreenCarlos Baleba celebrates scoring against Wolves with his trademark somersault.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAThe French side won the race to sign him ahead of Rennes and Atalanta after Baleba had emerged as one of the most promising young players at EF Brasseries, which has produced a string of Cameroon internationals including Samuel Eto’o, Geremi, Rigobert Song and Vincent Aboubakar since its creation in 1989. His father played professionally in South Africa before returning to Douala to become a coach at the club, although it was what Hürzeler describes as an “intrinsic motivation to always get better” that inspired Baleba as a young player.“I lived in a hut made of planks, with my father and mother,” he has said. “In front of my door, there were truck tyres. I used them to work on my agility. I was determined to become a professional. When I watched Champions League matches on TV, I said to myself: ‘I want to play against them, rub shoulders with these players and then, I want to overtake them.’ When I go on the pitch, my mindset is to tear everything apart and destroy everything in my path. I want to be the best.”On his arrival at Lille, Baleba played for the reserves in France’s third tier and was not allowed a mobile phone in an attempt to keep him focused. “If his parents wanted to speak to him they would have to call someone from the club and they would bring the phone to him,” says the Cameroonian journalist Njie Enow. “The goal was to keep him grounded to ensure that he wasn’t distracted. He’s had a really meteoric rise but has also had his fair share of tragedy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Baleba made only 21 appearances in Ligue 1 before being bought by Brighton for up to €30m amid interest from Liverpool and other suitors. Whereas Caicedo was loaned to the Belgian club Beerschot after arriving from Ecuador, Baleba was thrown into the deep end by De Zerbi and excelled on his first start – a2-2 draw against Liverpoolin October 2023. Brighton’s chief executive, Paul Barber, believes that mastering English and having a supportive network have been the key factors in Baleba’s rapid progress.“With Carlos, you’ve got a young guy who’s living a very different life to what he was used to in Cameroon,” he says. “He’s got some people around him that can support him and he can trust them. Making sure his language skills were up to the right level was very important because so many young players that come from different parts of the world, it’s not actually settling into the UK or playing football in a different country that’s the problem; it’s language. And if you can’t communicate, you can’t settle, you can’t tell someone that you’re sad, or you can’t tell someone that you are struggling.”Enow says: “A guy like Baleba needs trust and confidence and the people around him have created an environment where he is able to thrive. For us in Cameroon it’s really exciting because we have a crop of younger players coming up and I think Baleba will be the face of the next generation.”Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionCameroon football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Needless to say, Football Daily is of the opinion that Rio enjoys a heated post-match stramash as much as the next football fan and was probably only saying what he thought his bosses would want to hear. The same bosses, presumably, who quickly posted an almost four-minute long clip of these “scenes nobody wants to see” on their YouTube channel, because they knew perfectly well that everybody who hadn’t been watching them unfold in real time would be desperate to watch them later.Following an evening of vigorous, uncompromising thud and blunder in the last ever Merseyside derby to be staged at Goodison Park, the spoils were shared when the Clampetts of Everton dragged their more highfalutin neighbours down to their leveland drew 2-2through a combination of experience and a late, late James Tarkowski strike that was violently leathered past Alisson and threatened to rip the net clean off its moorings in the eighth of five minutes of added time. Cue pandemonium that included, but was not restricted to, widespread “limbs”, “scenes” and a pitch invasion in the corner of the ground where Tarkowski, his teammates anda triumphant corner flag-waving fanled celebrations that had spilled over from the Gwladys Street End. It would have taken an extremely brave referee to chalk off the home side’s equaliser but despite the best attempts of the Stockley Park curtain-twitchers located in comparative safety 212 miles away, they could find no reason to imperil Michael Oliver and the goal was allowed to stand. On a landmark night in the history of Merseyside derbies it was almost certainly the right decision, even if Liverpool’s manager, players and fans were almost unanimous – and quite possibly correct – in their insistence that it wasalmost certainly the wrong decision.Following the entertaining post-match melee that prompted Rio to clutch his pearls like a Victorian dowager and retreat to his designated fainting couch, Abdoulaye Doucouré and Curtis Jones were given their marching orders after instigating a brawl, the former incurring the latter’s wrath by enthusiastically goading the Liverpool fans assembled into the away end. Along with his assistant, Arne Slot was also shown a red for comments he made to Michael Oliver. Having had a number well and truly done on him by his wily counterpart in the adjacent technical area, the hitherto unflappable Dutchman must now serve a touchline ban for using “offensive, insulting or abusive language”. Sadly, his dismissal meant Slot wasn’t allowed to attend post-match media duties, so we didn’t get to listen to his views on the travesty of footballing justice he felt had just unfolded. On the plus side, given the laissez-faire attitude towards effing and jeffing on live television to which he will have long been accustomed as a native of the Netherlands, TNT viewers of a nervous disposition were at least spared the kind of profanity that “nobody” likes to hear.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEIt’s Bigger Vase’s playoff round (plus Tin Pot’s too!) so join Rob Smyth from 7.30pm GMT for clockwatch updates on all the action.QUOTE OF THE DAY“[We] would like to apologise to the club’s fans and supporters, and to the fans of football for the post-match incident involving our U-21 player.

The 58-year-old said the procedure was to treat a heart condition he has known about since he was 11 years old.“Three weeks ago I had open heart surgery to replace my aortic valve and repair my aortic root,” Black wrote on Instagram. “My ‘incompetent’ bicuspid aortic valve was discovered when I was 11 years old and for the last 47 years I have been looked after by the cardiac team at Southampton General Hospital.“At my annual check up last summer it was clear that things had deteriorated despite me having no obvious symptoms. It was a shock but deep down I knew this day would come even though I never allowed my heart disease to define me and prevent me from pursuing my athletic career.”Despite the heart problem, Black had a hugely successful athletics career, coming second in the men’s 400m at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 behind the USA superstar Michael Johnson. He also won gold for Great Britain in the 4x400m relays at the world championships at Tokyo 1991 and Athens 1997.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However in her final training session before competing she felt a tightness in the hamstring, which a scan subsequently revealed was more serious than it initially appeared.‘Women’s sport is in a good place’: Keely Hodgkinson hails Spoty’s four in a rowRead more“I won’t lie – when I got the news, I shed a tear,” said Hodgkinson. “I’ve worked so hard for this moment and was in the best shape of my life. I’m absolutely gutted that I won’t be able to race for the fans, especially after so many have bought tickets to see me try and break the world record.”Hodgkinson still hopes to compete in the world indoor championships in China in five weeks’ time, however a statement from her management group, Forte, admitted there were “questions about her ability to compete again this winter”.In the meantime, she will attend the Keely Klassic to cheer on other British stars, including the 1500m Olympic bronze medallist Georgia Bell and the world indoor pole vault champion Molly Caudery.“This event was never just about me – it was always about showcasing British talent, creating something new for the sport, and bringing more energy and entertainment to athletics,” said Hodgkinson, who had set up the event herself with the help of Forte. “That’s something I’m committed to for the long term.“I’ll be in Birmingham on Saturday doing everything I can to make sure it’s an amazing night for the athletes and the fans. I want to help create a real festival atmosphere, engage with as many young people as possible, and hopefully inspire the next generation to fall in love with track and field.”Hodgkinson’s absence will, however, spare the blushes of theBBCwhich before her injury had already decided not to show her world record attempt on its main terrestrial channels.Instead it had chosen to show Mr Malcolm’s List, a film it aired as recently as October 2024, and a repeat of Flog It! on BBC Two instead - with the Keely Klassic event relegated to its iPlayer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve still got a lot of hard work now. But if the tournament grows, and cricket grows across the country, then it’ll be almost a no brainer for us.”However, the sport’s governing body insisted that it would retain control of the governance of the competition and the calendar, despite the influx of wealthy and powerful investors into the game.“We didn’t want to sell the competition, because it’s really important that the structure of the game, and how the season is structured, is retained and owned by the ECB and our members,” the organisation’s chief executive, Richard Gould, said. “And there has to be a two-thirds majority in the ECB articles for any change to the County Championship, T20 Blast or any domestic cricket project.”“What we’ve got to work through with the counties is, what’s the most effective and efficient English summer now?The Hundredhas been here for a while. Obviously, it’s not going away. So what does the rest of the English summer look like?”View image in fullscreenA Hundred crowd at the Oval in 2021. The tournament has been aimed at families.Photograph: John Walton/PAA number of investors are understood to prefer the Hundred to become a Twenty20 competition in line with other tournaments overseas once the current TV deal runs out in 2028. However, this possibility was downplayed by the ECB.“At this point in time, we haven’t had a huge amount of clamour for changing the format,” said Banerjee. “They just want to see a successful tournament that continues to grow. That’s what they’ve bought into.”The ECB also denied suggestions that the Hundred might be staged earlier in the day to appeal to the Indian market, especially as games in the T20 World Cup in the West Indies started at 10.30am last year because of Indian TV demands.“What the investors are looking to do is things that can be successful with audiences in this country,” added Banerjee. “And the aspects of the Hundred that have worked well in terms of addressing and reaching out to a new market – the fact that it finishes at 9.30pm, so families can attend – is part of what’s appealed to investors.”Under the terms of the sale – one that promises grassroots initiatives around £50m – even the 11 counties without a team in the Hundred stand to gain somewhere between £20m and £27m each.Meanwhile, in a letter to cricket supporters, the ECB chair, Richard Thompson, said the auction would lead to benefits for the game at all levels. “This investment isn’t just about financial strength or growth of The Hundred itself,” he wrote. “It’s given us a golden opportunity to safeguard the future of cricket in England and Wales at all levels.“This means vital support for county cricket, growing the women’s game, and inspiring even more children – and people of all ages – to pick up a bat and ball.”Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketECBnewsShareReuse this content"

This technology is fast enough for them to adopt that they could misuse it and do real harm.”In reference to the head of the al-Qaida terrorist group who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks in 2001, he said: “I’m always worried about the Osama bin Laden scenario, where you have some truly evil person who takes over some aspect of our modern life and uses it to harm innocent people.”Schmidt agreed with the US export controls introduced by the former US president Joe Biden, which restricted the sale of the microchips that power the most advanced AI system to 18 countries to slow adversaries’ progress on AI research.He urged government oversight on private tech companies that are developing AI models, but added that over-regulation could stifle innovation. “It’s really important that governments understand what we’re doing and keep their eye on us,” he said.“My experience with the tech leaders is that they do have an understanding of the impact they’re having, but they might make a different values judgment than the government would make.”Google owner drops promise not to use AI for weaponsRead moreSchmidt was speaking from Paris, where the two-day AI Action summit finished on Tuesday with theUS and UK refusing to sign an agreementon “inclusive” AI.The declaration was signed by 57 countries, including India and China, the EU and the African Union.The UK declined to back the joint communique because it failed to provide enough “practical clarity” or address “harder questions” about national safety.The US vice-president, JD Vance, has said that regulation would “kill a transformative industry just as it’s taking off”.Schmidt said Europe’s more restricted approach meant “that the AI revolution, which is the most important revolution in my opinion since electricity, is not going to be invented in Europe”.Separately, Schmidt, who was head of Google when the company bought Android, which now makes the most-used mobile phone operating system in the world, said he supported initiatives to keep phones out of schools.“The situation with children is particularly disturbing to me,” he said. “I think smartphones with a kid can be safe, they just need to be moderated … we can all agree that children should be protected from the bad of the online world.”Schmidt has also supported proposals for a ban on social media for children under 16. He said: “Why would we run such a large, uncontrolled experiment on the most important people in the world, which is the next generation?”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Eric SchmidtGoogleShareReuse this content"

It was produced in partnership with thePulitzer Center’s AI Accountability Networkand theMarkup, now a part ofCalMatters, and co-published with theGuardianand the19th.When a young woman in Denver met up with a smiling cardiologist she matched with on the dating app Hinge, she had no way of knowing that the company behind the app had already received reports from two other women who had accused him of rape.She met the 34-year-old doctor with green eyes and thinning hair at Highland Tap & Burger, a sports bar in a trendy neighborhood. It went well enough that she accepted an invitation to go back to his apartment. As she emerged from his bathroom, he handed her a tequila soda.What transpired over the next 24 hours, according to court testimony, reads like every person’s dating app nightmare.After sipping the drink, the woman started to lose control. Her memory blurred. She fell to the ground, and the man started to film her. He put her in a headlock, kissing her forehead; she struggled to free herself but managed to grab her things and leave. He followed her out the door, holding her shoes and trying to force her back inside, but she was able to call an Uber, vomiting in the car on the way home.She woke up at home, soaking wet on her bathroom floor, the key to her house still in her door. She continued vomiting for hours. When she came to, she reported the assault to Hinge.Hinge is one of more than a dozen dating apps owned by Match Group. The $8.5bn global conglomerate also owns brands likeTinder(the world’s most popular dating app), OKCupid and Plenty of Fish. Match Group controls half of the world’s online dating market, operates in 190 countries and facilitates meetups for millions of people.Match Group’sofficial safety policystates that when a user is reported for assault, “all accounts found that are associated with that user will be banned from our platforms”.So why, on the night of 25 January 2023, was Stephen Matthews still on the app? Just four days before, Match Group had been alerted when another woman reported him for rape. A little more than a week later, he was reported for rape again. This time, the survivor went to the police.None of these women knew that the company had known about his violent behavior for years. He was first reported on 28 September 2020. By then, Match Group’s safety policy was already in place.Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested – the only thing that got him off the apps. At least 15 women would eventually report that Matthews had raped or drugged them. Nearly every one of them had met him on dating apps run by Match Group.View image in fullscreen‘Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested – the only thing that got him off the apps.’Photograph: Anson ChanOn 25 October,a Denver judge sentenced Matthews to 158 years to life in prisonafter a jury convicted him of 35 counts related to drugging and sexually assaulting eight women, drugging two women and assaulting one more for a total of 11 women. Attorneys for the women said much of that violence could have been prevented.“It is shocking that for years after receiving reports of sexual assault, Hinge continued to allow Stephen Matthews access to its platforms and actively facilitated his abuse,” said Laura Wolf, the attorney representing the woman whose police report led to the arrest. Following best practices for reporting on sexual assault, theDatingApps Reporting Project is honoring survivors’ requests for anonymity. Matthews’s attorney, Douglas Cohen, declined to comment. A letter that the Dating Apps Reporting Project sent directly to Matthews in jail went unanswered.Match Group’s reach is so massive – its mission is “to spark meaningful connections for every single person worldwide” – that peopleare more likely to meet through its appsthan out at the bars, at church or through friends.But Matthews’s case shows that even as these apps have made it easier for people to connect with a seemingly endless pool of potential lovers, they have also made it easier for people who commit sexual abuse to reach a seemingly endless number of potential targets.In 2022, a team of researchers at Brigham Young University published ananalysisof hundreds of sexual assaults in Utah. They found that attacks facilitated by dating apps happened faster and were more violent than when the perpetrator met the victim through other means. They also found that perpetrators who used dating apps were more likely to target vulnerable people. Almost 60% of sexual assault survivors self-reported a mental illness.Match Group has known since at least 2016 which users have been reported for drugging, assaulting or raping their dates, according to internal company documents. Since 2019, Match Group’s central database has recorded every user reported for rape and assault across its entire suite of apps; by 2022, the system, known as Sentinel, was collecting hundreds of troubling incidents every week, company insiders say.Match Group promisedin 2020that it would release what’s known as a transparency report – a public document that would reveal data on harm occurring on and off its platforms. If the public were aware of the scale of rape and assault on Match Group apps, they would be able to accurately assess their risk. As of February 2025, the report has not been released.Instead, as people continued to get hurt, the company dithered over what damning information should be hidden. “Do we publish only where we are required by law?” reads a slide in a 2021 presentation shown multiple times to Match Group employees as well as to external safety partners. “Do we push back on how much we are required to reveal, or do we try to go beyond what is required?”View image in fullscreenScreenshot of an 8 April 2021 Match Group presentation about the company’s transparency-reporting strategy.Photograph: MarkupNo online space is risk-free. But while Match Group has long possessed the tools, financial resources and investigative procedures necessary to make it harder for bad actors to resurface, internal documents show the company resisted efforts to spread them across its apps, in part because safety protocols could stall corporate growth.“The obsession with metrics and having to stick with them is frustrating and potentially dangerous,” one employee wrote in 2021 after the company learned that the investigative news non-profit ProPublica was planning a story. “This is not the way we were meant to work and people’s lives are at risk.”View image in fullscreenScreenshot of a 2021 document with a Match Group employee’s feedback.Photograph: MarkupThe same person asked their superiors: “‘How much would you personally pay to stop just one person being sexually assaulted by a date, one child being trafficked or one vulnerable person being driven to suicide by a predator?’ I feel that if I asked members of our staff that question individually, they would put a high value of their own money on it – but as a group nobody is ready to hear that yet.”Since 2021, Match Group has publicly promised to improve the safety of their products and to share data, but company insiders say safety has not improved. A brief hiring spree sparked by congressional and media scrutiny has been largely scaled back, according to former employees. In 2024, the remaining employees from the central trust-and-safety team Match Group had set up in response to increased scrutiny were let go and their jobs outsourced to overseas contractors. Facing pressure from Wall Street, Match Group removed its CEO, Bernard Kim, in early February 2025 as he struggled to cut costs and end the steady decline in subscribers to Match Group’s most powerful app,Tinder.Members of Congress have repeatedly requested data from Match Group on sexual harm. In February 2020, 11 members ofCongress wroteto then CEO Shar Dubey asking for details on how the company responds to reports of sexual violence. In July 2023, two Democrats, the then representative Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and the representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois followed up after we inquired on the status of their efforts. The company has still not provided the data.In September 2024, the House of Representativespassed a billthat would have required consumers to be notified if they had interacted with a user on a dating app who had been banned for defrauding consumers of money or personal financial information. But the bill stopped short of addressing the issue of sexual assault on the apps, and it died in the Senate.Our review of hundreds of pages of internal company documents, along with thousands of pages of court records, securities filings and analyst reports, coupled with dozens of interviews with current and former employees and survivors of sexual violence found that women who report being raped get no traction, while accused rapists like Stephen Matthews keep swiping – and assaulting.Our own testing on Match Group apps showed that as of February 2025, not much had changed. Banned Tinder users, including those reported for sexual assault, would easily rejoin or move to another Match Group dating app, all while keeping most of their key personal information exactly the same.The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent Match Group a four-page letter detailing our findings. The company responded with a short statement. The statement did not dispute that Match Group had carefully documented the extent of harm on company apps for years without sharing that information with the public. It also defended the company’s efforts to make platforms safe.“We recognize our role in fostering safer communities and promoting authentic and respectful connections worldwide,” the statement provided by Kayla Whaling, senior director of communications, read. “We will always work to invest in and improve our systems, and search for ways to help our users stay safe, both online and when they connect in real life.”The company said it vigorously combats violence. “We take every report of misconduct seriously, and vigilantly remove and block accounts that have violated our rules regarding this behavior,” its statement read.Our own testing found otherwise.Starting in April 2024, the Dating Apps Reporting Project created a series of Tinder accounts that we subsequently reported for sexual assault. Soon after, Tinder banned the accounts, and we started investigating how easy it would be for a banned user to create new accounts.Repeatedly, we found that users, soon after being banned, could create new Tinder accounts with the exact same name, birthday and profile photos used on their banned accounts. Users banned from Tinder were also able to sign up for Hinge, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish without changing those personal details.To get around the Tinder ban, we used techniques commonly suggested by online guides and forums that don’t require much technical knowledge to understand. We were able to verify three techniques that allowed banned Match Group users to repeatedly bypass being flagged when creating new accounts.In its statement, Match Group cast itself as an industry leader in deploying technology to promote safety, including “harassment-preventing AI tools, ID verification for profiles, and a portal that helps us better support and communicate with law enforcement investigating crimes. … Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences. We are committed to doing the work to make dating safer on our platforms and beyond.”28 September 2020 – the date Denver cardiologist Stephen Matthews raped a woman who reported him to Hinge – is also the date Tracey Breeden was brought on as Match Group’s head of safety and social advocacy.Breeden was a flashy hire. “With Tracey coming on board, we are reaffirming our commitment not just to be safety leaders in the dating space, but across the entire tech sector,” then CEO Shar Dubey said.Sporting a trademark black leather jacket and short, slick-backed hair, Breeden had gone by the nickname “Tornado” during her 15-year career in law enforcement. What made her attractive to Match Group was her most recent job at Uber: she had helped the global ride-hailing company revive its reputation after a series of scandals, from persistent reports of harassment of female employees to allegations that it was ignoring sexual assault that occurred during Uber rides.Breeden spearheaded a safety report in 2019 that told the public what Uber knew about nearly every problem, including nationwide reports of intoxicated drivers, traffic fatalities and incidents of sexual violence. The report became a key metric of success for the company.In hiring Breeden, Match Group hoped to replicate this success across its portfolio of apps. “Corporations,” she said in a press release announcing her arrival, “have a responsibility to help ensure safe experiences for their users”.Breeden’s team garnered public attention for their new safety measures, including partnerships with NGOs, optional AI-assisted photo verification and a law-enforcement portal where police and prosecutors could request data.She also fostered a partnership with Garbo, a startup that offered low-cost background checks.It launched on Tinder in 2022.Experts point out that background checks are not always reliable as they pull from outdated databases, andresearchsuggests that most people who commit sexual abuse do not encounter the criminal justice system. For example, Matthews had no criminal record.During this time, Match Group invested $100m in safety, the company said, and boasted about Breeden’s “central safety team”.Her team of veteran safety professionals referred to themselves as “the Avengers”, even donning superhero costumes at company events.View image in fullscreenAn Avengers Zoom background, displayed at a Match Group company event.Photograph: MarkupBut Michael Lawrie called this “safety theater”.Lawrie worked for Match Group for nearly a decade, shaping and leading a safety team for one of the company’s smaller brands, OKCupid. Sometimes working 80-hour weeks, he spent hours, even days, sniffing out savvy users who tried to thwart bans by creating multiple accounts.Over a 30-year career in content moderation, Lawrie said, he saw many users like Stephen Matthews. “You’re dealing with one repeat offender. I’ve dealt with God knows how many repeat offenders,” he said.A yellow Post-it note on the side of Lawrie’s work computer had listed out some of his responsibilities: “Rape flags. … Investigate miscreants.”These days, Lawrie is trying to start an advocacy organization for content moderators and other frontline safety workers. But, he said, he’s done with dating apps.“I don’t think they’re safe enough at the moment,” he said. “They’re going to get worse. … I’m hoping dating sites vanish.”Lawrie said he was initially excited about Breeden’s hire. He said she spent her first few months on the job talking to each brand’s safety team and told him that she was “very impressed” by the work OKCupid was doing.View image in fullscreenMichael Lawrie, former head of user safety and advocacy at OKCupid.Photograph: Courtesy of Michael LawrieLeaders from each of Match Group’s biggest apps provided their self-described strengths and weaknesses to Breeden’s team, according to an internal spreadsheet. At Hinge, these weaknesses included a “very rudimentary warning system with no targeted comms and no follow through” and “no way to find” the original profile “of a bad actor who has created multiple profiles”.Breeden was confronted with an existential problem. “Our current ban categories won’t allow us to answer the public’s biggest question: Am I likely to be harmed on my date?” reads a slide in a presentation drafted by her team in April 2021. While each of Match Group’s apps had a system of reporting and banning violent users, the information was disorganized, and none of the apps talked to each other.View image in fullscreenA slide from a 2021 Match Group presentation.Photograph: MarkupLawrie hoped Breeden would improve safety at the company. But he quickly grew frustrated that neither she nor Match Group leadership listened to his pleas for what they really needed to make platforms safer: to hire trained – and expensive – investigators and integrate powerful moderation tools across all the apps.OKCupid already had those tools. Lawrie was using them every day.One of those was the Sentinel system, which had been up and running across Match Group’s apps for at least five years before Breeden arrived. It worked like this: when a user was banned for something serious – like sexual assault – a case was created in Sentinel with the phone number and email address associated with their account. In interviews, multiple current and former employees described how those reports circulated through each of Match Group’s apps. The system was designed to ban anyone who used that information. It also grabbed the original profile’s IP addresses, photos and birthdate.View image in fullscreenAn example of a banned user in Sentinel, with sensitive information redacted by the Markup.Photograph: MarkupSuch a system seems robust at first glance – but none of the Match Group’s apps required users to provide photo identification (the kind needed to buy alcohol or board an airplane), so once a person was kicked out, they would easily start a new account with different contact information. A quick search yielded scores of online forums with clear steps and suggestions for how to rejoin the apps. In addition, internal company documents showed that information on IP addresses, photos and birthdate were not used to ban a user if they appeared on another Match dating app.Lawrie’s team at OKCupid knew Sentinel could only do so much.So his team deployed other tools to fix its shortcomings, including one that could automatically ban a profile that was linked to a phone number, photo or URL that had been previously banned – even if the user made an account with a different email or IP address. This tool was designed to be proactive rather than reactive, so that the profiles of alleged perpetrators like Matthews would not resurface after they had been reported.Internal company documents from 2019 and 2020 show thousands of reports of “serious physical assault”, abuse and violence on OKCupid that were deemed serious enough to get users banned from all of Match Group’s apps. This is among the information the company kept from the public.Breeden and Match Group leadership praised Lawrie and his team at OKCupid, he said, for their thorough investigative work and for handling some of the company’s most difficult cases. Yet, he said, Match Group never built out a skilled, experienced investigative unit at other brands like the one he headed up at OKCupid. Under Breeden’s leadership, he said, they faced pressure to speed up investigations and train outsourced labor to use complicated moderation tools.In 2021, a week after adamning articlerevealed that content moderators with little training were asked to rapidly deal with violent sexual content across Match Group’s brands, then CEO Dubey sent out an all-staff email addressing the controversy. She CC’d Breeden, acknowledging that the brand’s safety teams were not all on equal footing.As Match Group prepared internally for the story to break, Lawrie was asked to write a report for Breeden outlining his team’s accomplishments “to make sure when Tracey describes and acknowledges what you are doing individually to celebrate the good work that you are doing”.Lawrie used that report to protest.“Most professionals aren’t judged on how many cases they can hurry through in an hour,” he wrote. The way Match Group expected its trust-and-safety and support teams to work “basically diminishes their skills and makes them production-line workers”.Breeden declined to comment for this story, citing a nondisclosure agreement.Lawrie left the company in 2022 and said most of his small team that had been ferreting out malicious users also left due to a negative workplace environment. He said much of their work was outsourced to contractors with little training and severe quotas.He now cautions anyone using a dating app to understand that the apps are not in the business of protecting users.“You’re on your own pretty much,” he said.As Lawrie was getting pushed out of Match Group, Matthews kept appearing on the company’s apps.One crisp fall evening in 2022, one of the Denver cardiologist’s old medical school classmates was on Hinge when her phone screen filled up with a familiar face.Matthews was being promoted on the app as a Standout, a popular profile that Hinge’s algorithm thinks another user will like. To match with a Standout, users must send the person a rose. They get one free rose a week, but they cost $3.99 a pop after that. His classmate did not send Matthews a rose.View image in fullscreenDespite having been reported for rape to Hinge, Stephen Matthews’s profile was promoted on the app as a Standout, as indicated by the rose icon in the bottom-right corner.Photograph: Pulitzer Center/MarkupBy this point, Matthews had already been reported for rape at least once to Hinge. Court documents show that he had already allegedly sexually assaulted nine women and drugged 10. Not only did the apps allow him back on, they featured Matthews’s profile.As the Covid-19 pandemic dragged on, people got tired of forking money over for dating apps. Match Group still made a hefty profit, but its growth flatlined. Its stock cratered, losing nearly half its value between October 2021 and April 2022. That month, an analyst from JP Morganwrote thatthe firm had received more messages about “the underperformance of MTCH shares in recent weeks than any other topic”.In May 2022, Match ousted Dubey as CEO and installed Bernard Kim, a former executive at the gaming company Zynga that had popularized viral games like FarmVille.While Dubey spoke frequently about trust and safety and worked closely with Breeden, Kim hardly mentioned safety when he began his time at Match Group, instead emphasizing the need for continued rapid expansion to drive long-term shareholder value.Lawrie said that Kim, with his background in gaming rather than dating apps, had no interest in love. “He just wants to make money. He’s just there to increase profits,” Lawrie said. “If he’s looking at a bottom line, then it’s easier to have a lawsuit than it is to provide safety. I know which one he’s gonna pick.” Match Group declined to make Kim available for an interview. Messages sent to Kim directly went unreturned.While the tension between growth and safety exists across the tech sector, it is especially high at dating-app companies where executives have to worry about constant churn – users leaving the apps when they are no longer looking for dates. Every time Match Group delivers on its promise, it loses customers.In February 2024, six dating-app usersfiled what they hope will be certified as a class-action lawsuit. They argue Match Group uses “addictive” features to encourage compulsive use while not leading to any real increase in off-app relationships. “The app is designed specifically to hook them, and to keep them paying subscription fees – not to help them find love,” attorney Ryan Clarkson said. Match Group filed to dismiss the lawsuit in September, noting in its quarterly report that it “will defend vigorously” against the allegations.Despite Kim’s efforts, Match Group’s stock price continued to drop, and during that time, so did any mention of trust and safety. In more than a year of quarterly investor calls, Kim only referenced safety efforts once.Employees who pushed for these initiatives were forced out or laid off, including Breeden – a leader who was so convinced of her own invincibility that she showed up to an event wielding a Captain America shield.View image in fullscreenShar Dubey (left), then CEO of Match Group, speaking with Tracey Breeden (right).Photograph: Pulitzer Center/MarkupMatch Group fired its power hire in October 2022. Layoffs hit her team over the next several months. In February 2024, the remaining critical investigators and law enforcement liaisons on Breeden’s central safety team were shown the door.Lawrie said group chats of former Match Group employees have been gossiping about the cutbacks.“You’re not going to see them taking safety seriously ever again,” he said, adding that the only thing he thinks might change that is legislation.Four months before Matthews was arrested, a post on a Facebook group in Denver blew up, right around Christmas.Among posts warning other women about potentially harmful men,over and over again women furiously detailed negative experiences they or their friends had had with Matthews.Some women described him as “sketchy”. Others called him “terrible” and “not safe”. Multiple women told a similar, dark story: that they had been offered drinks, blacked out and were sexually assaulted.The thread reached 150 comments. Two women wrote the same thing: that they had been waiting for someone to post about the cardiologist.The flood of Facebook comments mirrored details in the police reports released the following year. Nearly all of the 16 women included in the district attorney’s initial complaints had been offered tequila. Eight recalled playing Jenga. Six mentioned a hot tub.As these stories circulated in this small corner of the internet in December 2022, the Denver cardiologist stayed on Match Group apps.Those fortunate enough to know about the Facebook group – and who had the foresight to check for Matthews on it – would be saved from a bad date or worse. But the fact that he could still log in to Tinder and Hinge left him with a pool of thousands of unsuspecting women whom he could – and would – continue to match with.The Dating Apps Reporting Project is aware of four additional women who have accused Matthews of drugging and/or raping them who were not part of the criminal complaint. Each of these women met Matthews on a Match Group app during a single year between the summers of 2020 and 2021.During the years Matthews was on their apps, Match Group hired and fired Breeden. It made loud promises on sexual violence, announced initiatives and product lines and promised a transparency report. But it was not straight with the public, which meant the women matching with Matthews on Match Group apps were not aware of the risk they faced.Match Group’s partnership with Garbo, the background-check company, also fell apart in the summer of 2023. “It’s become clear that most online platforms aren’t legitimately committed to trust and safety for their users,” Garbo wrote in asearing blog post.After spending so much energy talking about monetization, gamification and growth, Kim began to publicly acknowledge this problem. Speaking at the Citibank conference in the fall of 2023, he said the company was investing in new features to make sure “women have a good experience while they’re in the product. They feel safe. They feel secure. Etc.”The “etc” does not seem to include increased transparency about safety. Instead, in May 2023, Tinder released a “female-focused package”, a curated list of “high-quality profiles”. It is unclear how Tinder determines these high-quality matches. Hinge’s Standout feature, which is similar, had previously promoted Matthews.In fact, under Kim’s leadership, all mentions of a transparency report disappeared from the company’s annual impact report. Ironically, this was around the same time that new legislation in Europe required tech companiesto disclose reportsof “non-consensual behavior” and other issues. Match Group will be required to submit a transparency report to the European Union on the scope of harm on their platforms later this month. Lawmakers in India and Australia are also demanding transparency.This is exactly the situation Breeden and her team pondered three years ago. “What if publishing in one jurisdiction sparks a requirement in another?” read a slide in the same internal presentation where Match Group’s trust-and-safety leaders wondered whether they should “push back on how much [they] are required to reveal”.After Match Group published a disappointing earnings report in February 2025 that fell below analysts’ expectations, it also announced that Kim would be replaced by the former Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. Tinder’s revenue, sales and subscribers had all gone down.As Match Group struggles to reverse its decline, it’s also aware that its reputation is in the spotlight. Earnings calls and shareholder letters over the first three quarters of 2024 indicate that the company knows it is a business imperative to make women feel safer on its platforms. Match Group brought in a new vice-president of trust and safety whose job partly focuses on complying with increased global transparency requirements. The company is experimenting with requiring faces in photos and rolled out a “Share My Date” feature so you can be tracked while meeting up with an online stranger. On Tinder, it orchestrated a “major ecosystem cleanup” geared toward identifying fake profiles and getting scammers off the app.But neither the cleanup nor tracking a date from your phone would have stopped Matthews – a man who never sought to hide his identity, who assaulted his dates in his own home – from finding and harming women.Four years after Matthews’s first documented assault, he walked into a wood-paneled courtroom in Denver and was sentenced to 158 years to life in prison. “I will sentence. I cannot heal,” the judge, Eric Johnson, told the room filled with survivors and family members.“Countless women have suffered and will continue to suffer,” said Laura Wolf, the attorney who represented the woman whose police report triggered Matthews’s arrest. “Hinge and other dating platforms have taken no steps to ensure the safety of the product they are selling, matching unsuspecting women to known predators without pause or concern.”Match Group didn’t make it easy for the Denver prosecutors to convict Matthews. A search warrant was issued for Hinge in July 2023. Two months later, prosecutors were still empty-handed – with the judge in the case asking at a hearing whether he needed to start “dragging people in to get stuff done”. It wasn’t until February 2024 that the Denver district attorney’s office said they had finally received documents returned by Match Group.Matthews will likely never leave prison. Match Group executives currently face no charges. But the company knew about Matthews, and it knows about thousands of other abusive users. It has the data that could help people avoid dangerous situations, but it hasn’t shared it, leaving millions of people in the dark.Lawmakers around the world are starting to ask for answers from the most powerful force in modern dating. In June, Colorado passed a law, triggered by the Matthews case, that forces dating-app companies to tell the state attorney generalwhich safety measures they are taking to protect users. Although the law leaves room for the possibility of additional transparency in the future, it does not currently require the company to tell the state, or the public, how many people are raped or assaulted after using its platform. In the US, the surface has only been scratched. In most states, there’s little that requires Match Group to share information with users – or with Congress.The reality is that if Stephen Matthews were released today, he could get right back on a dating app. Match Group knows this – and now so do you.Stephanie Wolf contributed reporting. Statistical journalist Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett ledthe Markup’s testing of Match Group apps.Methodology: How we tested Match Group’s dating appsThe Markup created more than 50 accounts across Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish to test how Match Group treats reports of sexual assault and whether users banned from Tinder after a reported sexual assault could return to Match Group apps by creating new accounts. We conducted experiments in April and May of 2024 and again in January and February of 2025. The results were similar across both rounds of testing.To start, the Markup tested whether and how quickly Tinder would ban users who had been reported for in-person behavior. We found that Tinder consistently banned reported users within two days of receiving a report.Next, we tested whether a banned Tinder user could use their exact same basic account information to sign up for other Match Group dating apps: Hinge, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish. Hinge and OKCupid prevented us from creating accounts, but Plenty of Fish allowed us to create new accounts. Within 48 hours, the Plenty of Fish accounts were taken down.Our next tests focused on identifying what type of changes would allow banned users to rejoin Tinder or to create new accounts on other Match Group apps. To simulate what a typical user would try, the Markup utilized online guides and forums to identify commonly suggested techniques to get around a ban from a Match Group app.We then tried a combination of these suggestions, especially those that self-identified banned users claimed to have had success with. Across several rounds of testing, we found multiple ways to successfully create new Match Group accounts that bypassed the ban. Each method involved simple changes in how we signed up and the information we provided during the process.When attempting to rejoin or to create a new account on another Match Group app, we used the normal sign-up processes users go through and used the same phone number as the original banned account. During multiple tests, we successfully created new accounts without needing to change the user’s name, birthday or profile photos.The Markup did not test any methods that required significant technical knowledge and utilized only information that would be easily accessible to someone who did a cursory search of how to get around a ban. For example, the Markup did not test whether changing a profile photo’s metadata could alter the results. The Markup’s test accounts created for these experiments purposefully did not like, match with or message any real Match Group users.Natasha Uzcátegui-LiggettInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

The most likely Tesla model was the Cybertruck, the company’s electric pickup, given Musk’s claims that the vehicle is bulletproof.However, a spokesperson for the department said the document was incorrect, and should have been a generic entry reading “electric vehicle manufacturer”. The department said the order was on hold.Nevertheless, the listing raises the possibility of more conflicts of interest for Musk, who is one of the biggest beneficiaries of US government contracts through the companies he controls.Musk’s stake in Tesla accounts for the bulk ofhis $383bn wealth, but his rocket company, SpaceX, is the most important contractor providing space launch services to the US government.Yet Trump has also put Musk in charge of the so-called department of government efficiency, or Doge, its name deriving from an internet dog meme. Musk has set about gutting government departments that he has accused – without providing substantiated evidence – of huge amounts of fraud and waste. Doge’s efforts have beencriticised as illegal by many experts, who have said it is part of a string of actions by the Trump administration that appear to disregard the US constitution.Musk appeared to confirm the procurement plans on Thursday in a post on X, the social network he also owns, although he suggested that the sum the company could receive may be lower. Other contractors could be involved in upgrading vehicles, depending on the level of protection required.Musk wrote: “I’m pretty sure Tesla isn’t getting $400m. No one mentioned it to me, at least.”Musk was asked about the possibility of conflicts of interest on Tuesday, before the revelation of the proposed armoured vehicle spending. Speaking to reporters in the White House’s Oval Office, he dismissed those concerns, claiming that his actions in cutting government spending were transparent.“All of our actions are fully public,” Musk said when asked about conflicts of interest. “So if you see anything like, ‘Elon, there may be a conflict there,’ it’s not like people are going to be shy about it. They are going to say it immediately.”The Department of State forecast document suggested the Tesla contract would be awarded at the end of September. It listed the procurement as in the “planning” phase.The government spokesperson said the previous administration under Joe Biden had put out a request for armoured electric vehicles, but only one unnamed company had responded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the spokesperson said the solicitation was on hold and there were no plans to issue it.The department website contains two versions of the forecast document. Thefirstshowed the Tesla planned procurement, entered on 13 December 2024, according to the document. That was a month after Trump’s election, but before he took office.However,another versionshowed the entry was “modified” on Wednesday evening, apparently after the procurement was first reported by Drop Site News, an independent outlet. That entry was identical to the previous version except that the reference to “Tesla” was removed. Instead, it said the department would procure “armoured electric vehicles”, without referencing a brand name.The US government regularly procures armoured vehicles. The same procurement document contained entries for an “armoured sedan” and “armoured EV (not sedan)” made by unnamed manufacturers, plus “armoured BMW X5/X7”. Those contracts were valued at $50m, $40m and $40m respectively.Tesla was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsTeslaTrump administrationElon MuskUS foreign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The video was set to an electronic version of “Hava Nagila”, a Jewish folk song that is typically played at celebratory cultural events, and ended with the slogan: “Enough is enough. Join the fight against antisemitism.”Other stars depicted included Sacha Baron Cohen, Jack Black, Natalie Portman, Adam Levine, Ben Stiller and Lenny Kravitz.“It has been brought to my attention by family members and friends, that an AI-generated video featuring my likeness, in response to an antisemitic view, has been circulating online and gaining traction,” Johansson saidin a statement to People.“I am a Jewish woman who has no tolerance for antisemitism or hate speech of any kind. But I also firmly believe that the potential for hate speech multiplied by AI is a far greater threat than any one person who takes accountability for it. We must call out the misuse of AI, no matter its messaging, or we risk losing a hold on reality.”West, now known as Ye, repeatedly referred to himself as a “Nazi” and praised Hitler on X before deactivating his account.He also appeared in an advert during the Super Bowl directing people to his website, which started selling only one product – T-shirts with swastikas on them. The site was later taken down by Shopify due to policy violations, while Fox Television Stations CEO, Jack Abernethy, alsocondemned the ad in a note to staff.Johansson has been one of the most vocal celebrities against the use of non-consensual AI. Last year shethreatened legal action against OpenAIafter the company used a voice resembling her own in its new ChatGPT product – nine months after she said she turned down the company’s request to voice their AI system.OpenAI eventually removed the heavily promoted voice option from ChatGPT after a widespread reaction.Johansson said she had been “a very public victim of AI, but the truth is that the threat of AI affects each and every one of us”.She added: “There is a 1,000-foot wave coming regarding AI that several progressive countries, not including the United States, have responded to in a responsible manner. It is terrifying that the US government is paralysed when it comes to passing legislation that protects all of its citizens against the imminent dangers of AI.”The actor urged elected officials to take legislative action against AI abuses, calling it a “bipartisan issue that enormously affects the immediate future of humanity at large”.Her comments come as the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority said fake adverts featuring celebritiesremain the most common type of scam advertsappearing online.The AI video was created by Ori Bejerano, who describes himself as a generative AI expert on hisInstagram bio. His original post included a notice that said the content was “digitally created or altered with AI to seem real”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Scarlett JohanssonKanye WestPiracyIntellectual propertyFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It sticks with the same 6.1in OLED screen as its predecessors, which looks good but lacks an always-on mode. It’s also still stuck at a relatively slow 60Hz refresh rate, which can make scrolling and motion more jarring than on models with faster screens.The latest A18 chip is rapid and enables Apple’s Intelligence features (AI tools). The battery lasts about two days of general use, or at least a day of heavy use, and the phone charges with USB-C. It also supports MagSafe and Qi/Qi2 wireless charging and accessories. It starts with a decent 128GB of storage, although larger models are available if you don’t want to store your photos and videos in the cloud.The iPhone 16 is light and fairly compact for a modern smartphone, and its IP68 rating means it’s water-resistant to depths of six metres for up to 30 minutes – more than safe enough for any accidental dunks. It gains the useful Action button from 2023’siPhone 15 Pro, which replaces the mute switch and can be used to mute the phone or for various other functions, such as turning on the torch or launching apps. The new Camera Control button is great for quickly opening the camera, even if zooming, changing settings and shooting photos with the button is fiddly in the camera app.The dual camera on the back is good, comprising a main 48MP camera and an improved 12MP ultrawide camera, which now has a macro photography mode for fun closeup shots. It also has Apple’s photographic styles features for those who want to customise how the camera captures photos (rich contrast, vibrant, warm) and get creative with tone and colour palette. The main camera can do a 2x in-sensor zoom, which works well in bright light, but the lack of a real telephoto camera holds the 16 back. The 12MP selfie camera is the same as other iPhones.The iPhone runs the recently released iOS 18.3, which includessupport for RCS messaging with Androidand adds more of Apple’s new AI features.

The Genmoji tool in the keyboard can create custom emoji stickers too.Siri has a new design and can now pass queries to ChatGPT for more advanced answers. Apple’s notification summary tool has been tweaked too: it now summarises stacks of notifications with stylised italics and has paused summarising news and media notificationsafter a backlash.Apple’svisual intelligence featureallows users to point their camera at an object, text or information, such as URLs, calendar entries or phone numbers, to use them or find out more about them, including sending images to ChatGPT or Google for information.From £799 at AppleFrom £739 at John LewisWhy should you buy it?The iPhone 16 provides the standard iPhone experience at a cheaper price and in the most pocketable size, offering good battery life and access to new and future AI features.Buy if:you want the default, good iPhone experience todayDon’t buy if:you want optical zoom on your cameraRead ourfulliPhone 16 review: more buttons and speed for Apple’s standard phoneScreen:6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED)Processor:Apple A18Storage:128, 256 or 512GBCamera:48MP main + 12MP UW; 12MP front-facingDimensions:147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm (HWD)Weight:170gBattery and size upgrade:iPhone 16 PlusView image in fullscreenThough somewhat bulky to fit in a pocket, the iPhone 16 Plus has great battery life and a 6.7in screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The ObserverFor an extra £100, the iPhone 16 Plus matches the specs, camera and features of the base model but adds a bigger 6.7in screen and long battery life, which can last up to three days of general use.

The 4.7in screen is small and dim by modern standards, despite the phone feeling quite chunky.

The display is crisp, bright and slick, with a faster 120Hz refresh rate to keep scrolling and animations smooth. The screen also supports the handy always-on feature, showing the time and notifications when not in use.The 16 Pro also has a slightly more powerful A18 Pro chip and starts with 128GB of storage, with greater space available – up to 1TB – for those who need it. The battery lasts a good 40 hours of general use, meaning it will go through the heaviest of days, and most will need to charge it only every other day.It has the same two extra Action and Camera Control buttons as the regular model, but the camera on the back is better.

To speed things up, check you have enough free storage and clear out any unused apps or content, off-loading photos and videos to the cloud and deleting music. Aim for at least 2GB of free space.If your phone is worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. The latest software, version iOS 18, supports devices back to 2018’siPhone XS/XR, so anything older should be replaced soon – though some older models may still receiveoccasional security updatesfrom Apple.What to look out for in a refurbBuying refurbished phonesis better for the planet and your wallet. The iPhone makes for an excellent refurbished phone, typically staying responsive for years and being supported with software updates for about seven years from release, or longer in some circumstances. That means you can use an older model for several years before it will need replacing.There are broadly two types of refurbished iPhone available: those refurbished andsold directly by Applethat come, essentially, as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or condition – but cost less.Quick GuideA buyer’s guide to refurbished phonesShowSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chainsCeXandGameand online stores such asmusicMagpieandEnvirofone. Marketplaces likeAmazonandeBayand refurb specialistBack Marketalso have a wide range. And some phone operators, includingO2,giffgaff,EEandVodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:Grade A– virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.Grade B– in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.Grade C– in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.Grade D– also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:Battery health– batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?Charging port– check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.Buttons– do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.Fingerprint scanner– is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.Network locks– check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.Unauthorised parts– not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.Check it isn’t stolen– check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against adatabase of stolen devicesthrough a service such asCheckMENDor similar.Warranty– what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Do not buyAny model older than an iPhone 13, because you won’t get many years of software support before you’ll have to replace it.An iPhone 13 mini unless it has a new battery. It had a relatively short battery life to start with and needed more frequent charging than larger iPhones, so its battery wears out faster.How I testedQuick GuideHow I testedShowWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us  evaluate a phone,  measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.We use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.The findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Why should you trust me?I have been reviewing consumer electronics for 16 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert.

Now a fast-growing business, it revealed plans last year to formally change its corporate structure.Musk and his own AI startup, xAI, and a consortium of investment firms want to acquire the non-profit’s controlling stake in the for-profit OpenAI subsidiary.OpenAI’s CEO,Sam Altman, quickly rejected the unsolicited bid in a post on social media and told questioners at a Paris summit on AI that the company is not for sale. The chair of OpenAI’s board, Bret Taylor, echoed those remarks at an event on Wednesday.Musk and Altman helped start OpenAI in 2015 and later competed over who should lead it before Musk resigned from the board in 2018. They have been in a long-running and bitter feud over the startup, with Musk suing, dropping his suit, and then suing again in 2024.Musk again criticized Altman’s management on Thursday during a video call to the World Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, describing it as akin to a non-profit aimed at saving the Amazon rainforest becoming a “lumber company that chops down the trees”. Altman has repeatedly countered that Musk’s legal challenges to OpenAI are motivated by his role as the founder of a competing startup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Who am I again? What am I here to do? Who are all these people? It’s been a golden time for fantasy lately and having inhaledDragon’s Dogma 2,Metaphor: ReFantazio, both seasons ofHouse of the Dragonand all of Rebecca Yarros’s Fourth Wing novels in less than a year, I’m starting to blur the finer details of one kingdom with another.Avowed’s fantasy universe comes ready-made, from developer Obsidian’s other Pillars of Eternity games. The lore is dense, the in-game text plentiful and characters verbose, but thankfully The Living Lands is fascinating to look at and the realm of Eora full of political tension and cool monsters. I remember precious few names or historical details, but I will remember several of my experiences in this game – the view from the rickety path hugging the walls of an underground cavern big enough for a mad priest to have built as gigantic automaton inside, and the skin-crawling secret I discovered in the basement of a companion’s family home. The look is Annihilation-meets-Oblivion, with fungal and floral detail embroidering the structures and peoples you encounter, and and ever-present tension between the organic and the corruptive.The Living Lands is being ravaged by a disturbing plague that sends people mad, before they are consumed by mushroom-like growths. You, an envoy from a distant centre of empire, have been sent to investigate. You are a godlike, touched by the immortals, and you are guided through this strange place by a divine voice in your head and a range of native companions, whose chatter I found genuinely edifying. There’s a lot of choice and self-direction in Avowed, and it’s a game that always respects your intelligence. Characters are interestingly (if densely) written and there are plenty of ways to respond to them. It’s a lot less patronising than the cringeworthily Whedon-esque good guy/bad guy/joker responses that other games force out of you.I expected a brisk 20-hour adventure in the vein of Obsidian’s sci-fi comedy The Outer Worlds, but reader, this isnot that. This game is immense. I took my time in the opening area of Dawnshore, having a fine old time probing into spider-webbed caverns (there are lots of those, this is not a game for the arachnophobic) and combing through ornate, abandoned ruins and climbing lighthouses looking for loot. (This was partly because I stalled on the main quest, having forgotten a vital piece of information that popped up once in a text tutorial for about five seconds.) Only after 15 hours in this pleasant coastal land did I meet one of the central antagonists, an impressively frightening warlord in intricate armour and a mask with smouldering eyes. I then found myself in a dense and rotting jungle-swamp full of surprisingly cheerful necromancers, and it was evenbiggerthan Dawnshore. When I arrived at a third new location after around 30 hours I realised that I very much did not have the measure of this world at all.Unfortunately Avowed would be better if itwere20 hours long. I always had fun striking out from town and getting lost, coming across interesting things to do exactly as you would in Skyrim or Fallout. But there are two sticky problems that suck the fun out of it over time. The first is common to a lot of open-world games: when you arrive in a new place, all the quests and fights are a little too hard. After a few hours’ questing, exploring and upgrading your weapons and armour, it hits a brief sweet spot where everything feels challenging but conquerable. Then you empower yourself to such an extent everything gets too easy, and it starts to feel like a box-ticking exercise. This pattern repeated itself over my time with the game, eroding my patience.The second issue is that Avowed’s combat just isn’t as fun as it thinks it is, and there’sso much of it. There are an impressive number of weapons and techniques available to you – grimoires and wands for spells, giant two-handed axes, bows and pistols, maces and shields. No matter what you choose, though, it feels imprecise and tedious, and your chances of success are determined by invisible numbers rather than skill. Try to take on enemies above your level and it will barely matter how well you dodge out of the path of a greatsword or how cleverly you combine your magic effects to freeze and shatter undead skeletons. What matters is the quality of your gear, which must be continually and laboriously upgraded with a warehouse’s worth of random materials that you find in every chest and lockbox. I got very sick of smashing R2 to fire magic projectiles or hack away at tree-monsters with my sword, chipping away determinedly at their hit points. My companions never felt especially helpful in battles, either.All the variety and texture that can be found in the fiction here is lacking in the combat and the loot. There are unique swords and trinkets at the ends of the most interesting quests, but the fun of exploring is tempered by the realisation that outside of the views and the characters, you’ll rarely find anything that interesting. If you come across a powerful enemy, you may well be underpowered for the fight. If you find a tantalising glowing chest in a cavern, there’s a strong chance it’ll be full of pennies, chunks of iron and a few pelts.Avowed started out as Obsidian’s answer to Bethesda’s Elder Scrolls series, and it did remind me a lot of Oblivion and Skyrim in the exciting moments where I stumbled across something unexpected in the wilds. But it also shares those games’ tendency towards repetition, and the weightless feel of their fighting. My first 15 or so hours in The Living Lands felt rich with potential, but I got fed up with it long before the end.Avowed is released on 18 February; £59.99skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As an adventurer and fan of ethically produced dairy products, you are determined to attend the fabled event, arriving at the dock on a small boat with only a few gold coins and a dream. This is the backdrop to the worst role-playing adventure I have ever experienced – and, entirely coincidentally, the only one I have ever designed.The game creation package RPG Maker has been around since 1992, the first version launching on the Japanese PC-98 computer. Since then, development has been passed from veteran software publisher ASCII to Enterbrain and then Chiyoda-based Gotcha GotchaGames, and dozens of instalments have appeared. Although it has become increasingly complex over the years, RPG Maker remains a remarkably intuitive way to make adventure games with no development experience at all.The package comes with thousands of pre-made maps, buildings, characters and items, which creators can use and modify; but you can also start from scratch, crafting your own assets to make unique games. Your projects can be shared with the RPG Maker community and several acclaimed indie games have been built with the program, including To The Moon, Corpse Party and Omori. I can tell you that Artisan Cheese Quest will not be joining them.View image in fullscreenAn exclusive screenshot of Artisan Cheese Quest on RPG Maker.Photograph: NIS AmericaTo be fair, the game only took me and my 19-year-old son Zac about two hours to make, using thePlayStation 5version of RPG Maker (launching on 21 February). At first we chose the Swamp location from the huge variety of pre-made maps, which mostly offer traditional fantasy and sci-fi options. Then we selected a character – a cute little anime-style warrior. From here you start the actual process of making a game that offers challenging things to do. Everything that takes place in the world is called an Event, and to create one you need to construct a set of conditions using a very simple visual programming language.If you’ve ever tried Scratch, the popular coding tool used in schools throughout the world, you’ll be right at home. Say you want to hide a magic key in a treasure chest: you place the chest on the map, then use the menu system to place a key inside it. Add a locked door then place a condition on that door: if the player has the key, the door opens, if they don’t, they get a fail message.With the same system, you can add branching dialogue with characters, plan enemy patrol paths and eventually craft a combat system – everything is controlled via a series of if/then commands. During lockdown, Zac and I used Scratch to make a very simple maze game where you guided a mouse towards a block of cheese, so we decided to stick with our established game design expertise here. We built a tavern, attached the tavern interior to a building on the main landscape map, added characters to provide hints and hid an artisan cheese festival pass in a treasure chest on a small island. We didn’t use any original assets but we did write all the dialogue and the story – i.e. find the pass, open the tavern door, eat cheese. Please keep us in mind for this year’s Bafta games award for best narrative.View image in fullscreenRPG Maker on PlayStation 5.Photograph: NIS AmericaMost importantly, the process was enormous fun. You’re able to select background music and sound effects, and going for wildly inappropriate options had us crying with laughter: we put very dramatic combat music in the most innocuous areas; our treasure chest screamed when you opened it; villagers randomly barked and growled. And however basic the final result is, you still get that thrill at having made something that functions and looks a lot like an actual game. As you get used to the system, your ambitions grow: we later added a zombie who wanders around the map complaining about his lactose intolerance.I’m not going to lie – although the system is intuitive, it getsextremelydemanding when you start thinking about creating multi-stage boss encounters or designing a levelling up system for your character. If you’re not used to working with lengthy routines and sub-routines and game mechanics that all mess with each other, you’ve a long road ahead. True, any time we weren’t sure how to make something work, the game’s online community helped: there are hundreds of videos on YouTube and lots of helpful people on Reddit. But I feel we’re some way from making anything even slightly resembling a commercial game.Perhaps at some point in the future, Artisan Cheese Quest will be one of the finest fromage-based fantasy role-playing adventures available onPlayStation5. For now, we’re just going to keep adding stupid sound effects until it stops being funny.

But a quieter fightback to Trump 2.0 is growingJon AllsopThere’s no sign of the mass protests of his first term – but Democrats are building a less flashy politics of oppositionThu 13 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 11.54 ESTShareIn January 2017, the day after Donald Trump was first inaugurated as US president, hundreds of thousands ofprotesters descended on Washingtonfor a “Women’s March” that was actually a broader-based vessel for popular rage. Not that the atmosphere was uniformly angry: Icovered the marchfor a US radio network and found pockets of joy among the crowd. “It’s really exciting,” a teenager from New York told me. “It’s democracy in action.”The march, and parallel events around the country, was emblematic of what came to be known as the#Resistance, a loud liberal movement in opposition to Trump that took the form not only of mass protests, but court fights, adversarial media coverage (and increased consumption thereof) and grassroots organising. The movement made cult figures (not to mention merchandise) of figures seen as standing up for institutions, from the Trump-probing special counsel Robert Mueller to the supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Now though, as Trump’s second term is under way,a consensushas formedthat the#Resistance is dead. Almost as soon as Trump won in November, media leadersswore off the term, andliberal newsconsumersappearedtotune out. Titans of tech and culture who criticised Trump last time around either openly backed him or grovelled at his feet; even staunch Democrats suggested that theywould find areasof common ground with his new administration. Protests around the inauguration were much smaller. Ross Barkanargued recentlyin the New York Times Magazine that the era of “hyperpolitics” – or politics as an all-consuming social battleground – is now over.Why? The principal answer might simply be fatigue. Trump is an exhausting figure, and American politics has now revolved around him for nearly a decade. And hopes that the burst of first-term energy against him would exile him from public life proved forlorn.You may not like Trump. But his attempts to seize the Fed contain a lesson for liberals | Leah DowneyRead moreThe opposition to Trump also appears rudderless. The institutional Democratic party might technically have a new leader –Ken Martin, a little-known apparatchik– but for now, it lacks towering political talents. Many supporters doubtless feel disillusioned after watching Joe Biden cast the last election in existential terms, then fail to do everything in his power to ensure that the Democrats won it, before welcoming Trump back withwarm words and a cuppa.And, if the Democrats are palpably diminished, there is a sense that Trump stands astride the political landscape as a colossus. In 2016,he won the electoral collegebut lost the popular vote bynearly 3 million, making room for the conclusion that his win was a fluke or somehow illegitimate. This time, the country knew the threat he posed, and he won decisively anyway. Trump and his allies have seized on that fact to claim a huge mandate.As the influential New York Times columnist Ezra Kleinhas noted, Trump’s victory has percolated down into US culture. Big tech firms and other industries may have submitted to Trump’s will this time out of fear that he would otherwise use the power of the state against them. But it seems equally likely that they are using the clarity of his victory as a permission slip to distance themselves from pesky liberal imperatives (diversity! Workers’ rights!) that they never liked, while seizing on areas of interest alignment and ideological affinity. For all his populist rhetoric, Trump has always been a slasher of tax and red tape at heart.The vibes, as the saying goes, have shifted since 2017. Trump has proved to be a lasting reflection of deep currents in American public opinion, not an accident. Peppy Obama-era liberalism is discredited. The #Resistance really does appear to be dead.Get rid of the hashtag and capital letter, however, and a small “r” resistance to Trump is still visible, as theWashington Post’s Perry Bacon JrandNew York magazine’s Rebecca Traisterhave argued. In-person protestsare kicking back into gear– albeit still on a smaller scale – as are Democratic blocking moves in Congress. There’s evidence that liberalsare tuning back into the news.None of this matches the mass energy and ubiquitous liberal iconography of 2017. But the less flashy work that undergirded the #Resistance – civil society groups suing to block Trump’s policies; local-level organising – is very much in evidence again this time. The Women’s March was a headline-grabbing show of force, but the courts were the most important brake on Trump in the early days of his first term. That’s already been the case again.And Trump is more vulnerable than he might appear to be, for two main reasons. First, if it was an overreaction to think that his 2017 win was an aberration, it’s also an overreaction to see him as an electoral Goliath now; he won the popular vote last yearonly narrowlyand with a plurality, not a majority. Second, he might be enjoying a honeymoon, but his radical and chaotic early moves in office are already likely eating up his political and cultural capital.In part, this is by design. Trump and his allies want to overwhelm their opponents, as has been well documented. But I think they also want to provoke them. Trumpism as a political project is about conquest, yes, but it’s also about conflict – it needs resistance in order to thrive. It is a politics that will keep on pushing until opponents can’t not fight back.The past few weeks might have heralded the death of a specific brand or aesthetic of oppositional politics. But the underpinning idea is alive. It might not feel exciting any more, but democracy is still in action.Jon Allsop is a freelance journalist.

Millions of lives are now at riskDevi SridharOn top of the human cost, the US’s soft power and influence is disappearing. Russia and China will fill the voidThu 13 Feb 2025 07.12 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 11.59 ESTShareAmid the daily troubling news coming from the United States are the ongoing and increasingly damaging efforts by President Donald Trump, supported by secretary of state Marco Rubio and Elon Musk, toshut downthe US Agency for International Development (USAid). Muskhas called it a “criminal organization” and said that it was “time for it to die”. The agency website is down, so little official information is available. But in the week since funding to the agency was frozen, and the majority of staff placed on leave, thousands of public health and development programmes worldwide have been thrown into turmoil, and now face an uncertain future.USAid is the main federal agency that works to provide foreign aid assistance to the poorest countries and people in the world. On Friday, a US judge prevented around2,000 USAid employeesfrom being placed on leave, and ordered the reinstatement of about 500 more. But Trump and Musk appear to want to move forward with a plan that would see its global workforce reduced from about 10,000 staff and contractors,to just over 600.It’s hard to overstate how disruptive this has already been tohumanitarian work worldwide: most programmes have just been shut overnight with staff laid off, drugs and food left in warehouses, and patients and others not able to access services. The people affected live in some of the most vulnerable countries like Ukraine, Jordan, Ethiopia, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Afghanistan.Although we don’t know the full extent of the damage, specific reports suggest that vital services have beenthrown into chaos. Some walk-in sexual health and HIV services in South Africashuttered overnight without notice, Ethiopia’s health ministry has reportedly laid off5,000 healthcare professionalswho were hired with US funding, and nearlyhalf a billion dollars worth of food aidoverseen by the agency and currently in ports, transit or storage is destined to spoil.USAid’s overall contribution is immense. It is the largest humanitarian operator globally – in 2023, the US provided 42% of all humanitarian assistance orabout $68bn(£55bn), of which USAid spendingmade up about $40bn. And yet at the same time, both foreign aid and USAid specifically make up a tiny fraction of federal government spending: less than 1%. Cutting back makes little difference to overall US government spending, but is massively destructive to programmes reliant on this funding to deliver theiron-the-ground work.What does that less than 1% of federal spending buy the US public? This argument has been re-hashed in presidency after presidency, and the answers are clear.Foreign aid can reduce instability, conflict and extreme poverty, which are major causes of mass displacement. Supporting programmes that keep more places safe and stable means fewer people needing to flee persecution, dire poverty or violence. With all the concerns over illegal immigration, reducing aid could make this challengeeven harder to manage. Foreign aid can support countries to grow economically and create new markets and opportunities. Think of places like India, which have managed to create a vibrant and growing middle class.In the world of global health, foreign aid is vital to support countries in managing health challenges, including outbreaks of infectious diseases. Just think back to the west AfricaEbola outbreak in 2014. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone struggled to contain Ebola spreading and were reliant on international partners to assist them. It was in the interest of all countries to help them given that the global spread of Ebola was imminent. In addition, the US builds vital soft power and influence in countries in which it provides help. Russia and China have learned this lesson – and will probably step into theaid vacuum left by the US.And beyond any of those “enlightened self-interest” arguments above is the simple fact that foreign aid helps other human beings who are struggling, including some of the poorest and most vulnerable in the world. It’s good to do because it’s simply good to do. Cutting programmes overnight means that women who might have lived are more likely to die in childbirth; those with HIV face not having access to clinics for lifesaving antiretroviral treatment; and hungry children no longer get nutritional supplements and food.Foreign aid shouldn’t be a partisan issue. The largest global health programme for a single disease, Pepfar, was launched by a Republican president, George W Bush, and is estimated to have prevented 25 million Aids deaths since its creation. I think back to apoll of Americansin 2016 by the Kaiser Family Foundation, where more than 60% of respondents said that the US was spending either the right amount or too little on global health, and only about 30% thought it was spending too much. It’s not clear that the US public actually supports these drastic cuts and freezes.Perhaps many now think that the US needs to worry more about its own domestic financial troubles than sending money overseas.A recent studyfound that the US economy is performing better than any of its peer countries, but performs worse on other metrics like health, happiness and social trust. “Wealthy but unhappy” is what the study’s authors found. Maybe the lesson here is that Americans need to reject Trump’s discourse and embrace being part of a global community and engaging with the world through agencies like USAid. That could lead to an America that is still wealthy, but just a bit more healthy and happy.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of EdinburghExplore more on these topicsUSAidOpinionUS politicsUS foreign policyAidAids and HIVDonald TrumpElon MuskcommentShareReuse this content"

Don’t expect them to put it outLee EscobedoGiving up on their best player was bad enough, but Dallas’ handling of the aftermath has been woeful and left fans fumingThu 13 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 06.02 ESTShareTheDallas Mavericksare on fire.Luka Dončić, now a Los Angeles Laker,is never coming back, that much is certain. Not after the organization, led by team governor Patrick Dumont and general manager Nico Harrison, has spent the last 10 days post-trade disparaging hisability, weight, and work ethic. And the front office’s disconnect is starkly illustrated by their apparent failure to grasp the profound civic and cultural significance of Dončić in Dallas.Dončić’s trade to the Lakers has been described asthe most shocking, and perhaps worst, in NBA history. Harrison, a mostly unknown name in hoops circles before the trade (even in Dallas), is now public enemy No 1 for Mavs fans.Even the most dysfunctional franchises know not to trade a 25-year-old megastar, fresh off a finals run, who speaks to fans in multiple languages and bought a house in the city where he had played his entire career. Just two years ago,Harrison decided to loseKristaps Porziņģis for a bag of chips and, even worse, Jalen Brunson for nothing. Harrison was seen as an upgrade over former general manager Donnie Nelson, who the base felt failed to build properly around Dončić. Mavs fans were at first fairly apologetic for Harrison’s missteps, blaming then owner Mark Cuban. But this month, whenHarrison took full responsibilityfor sending Dončić to the Lakers, it was apparent the former Nike executive was a shoe salesman out of his element. The trade destroyed Mavericks culture, the team’s relationship with their fans, any chance of a return to the NBA finals. Most significantly, it ended the Dončić-era in Dallas. The Mavs were praised for their seamless handoff from a hall of famer, Dirk Nowitzki, to a future one in Dončić. That link between the past and a bright future is gone.It would be silly to suggest things were perfect when Dončić was still a Maverick. Cuban had well-chronicled issues when he ran the team. He was often too involved and trusted the wrong people (for example,Haralabos Voulgaris,Chandler ParsonsandJason Lutin). And he deserves some blame for the current mess: he was the one who hired Harrison in 2021. He also chose to sell 72.3% of the team to Miriam Adelson, the fifth-richest woman in America, and her family for $3.5bn in 2023. Adelson, one of thecountry’s most controversial figures, is an ardent lobbyist for Israel, an enemy of Palestine and a top financial donor to Donald Trump. Adelson, the mother-in-law of Dumont, is wildly unpopular among large sections of the Mavericks fanbase because of the Dončić trade but also due to rumors she intends to tank the team as leverage tomove the franchise to Las Vegas, where Adelson has ties, to build a casino complex and stadium.The Luka Dončić-Anthony Davis trade is shocking, franchise-altering and bizarreRead moreSo, yes, Cuban does not get a free pass. But one thing is for sure: he would have never traded Dončić, once saying: “If I had to choose between my wife and keeping Luka on the Mavs, catch me at my lawyer’s office prepping for a divorce.”That’s because for all his faults, he understood what the team, Nowitzki and Dončic meant toDallas. At his heart, he’s a fan, a part of #MFFL, the hashtag that denotes loyalty to the team for ever. The same sentiment etched in stone at the Nowitzki statue outside.But instead of Cuban, we have Adelson, Dumont and Harrison, who have set the Dallas sports world ablaze with a single trade. The PR efforts and explanations aren’t working either. Every press conference, interview andTim MacMahon ESPN monologueonly stirs up fans, who have shown their fury in chants,tweets,video montagesandprotests outside the American Airlines Center.If you wanted to give the Mavericks ownership and front office a backhanded compliment, they have achieved something impressive. In an NFL city, they’ve managed to steal attention away from the Cowboys, America’s Team and the most valuable sports franchise in the world. But for all the wrong reasons.But while Dallas is a football city, Dončic helped turn the tide somewhat with his on-the-court joie de vivre. It’s why Dallas made excuses and didn’t riot when the team lost Brunson for nothing, only to watch him become a megastar in New York. At least they had the Slovenian wunderkind who, as long as he was on the floor, gave them a chance to win any game, against any opponent, on any night. Now he is gone in a trade that saw Harrison only deal with one other team, rather than seeing what he could get from the wider market. No wonder all they got back was a first-round draft pick, Max Christie, a player with good two-way potential but nowhere near Dončic’s talent, and Anthony Davis. Davis is a fine player – like Dončić a future hall of famer – but he is 31 and even more injury prone than the Slovenian. In his first gam for the Mavs, Davis was great – recording a 26 points and 16 rebounds – but he picked up an injury and willmost likely be out for a month. So much for trading Dončić because of fitness issues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ramifications of the trade will also haunt Mavs fans for the foreseeable future, as trauma usually does. Considering the future, Harrison gave up draft capital control between 2027 and 2030 for players brought in to fit around Dončic. The real poverty era will start in 2027, when Davis, Kyrie Irving and Klay Thompson are all over 34, past their prime, and the team can’t depend on the draft to replenish top talent.The organization’s attempt at censorship has only widened the wounds. During Monday night’s game, the Mavs showed fans on the jumbotron for the first time since the trade. Until then, they feared what fans would do when the cameras were on. During a karaoke montage, a fan mouthed “Fire Nico.”He was kicked out minutes later. Two other fanswere kicked outafter calling for Harrison’s firing and Cuban told them to “sit the fuck down”. The second incident was caught on camera and widely shared on social media. For many fans it was the perfect visual metaphor for the team’s descent into a draconian state, one where the minority owner feels comfortable enough to cuss out fans for voicing dissent (for his part, Cuban said he did not swear until the fans shouted and pointed at him, and he did not ask for them to be removed). Dumont was not spared either. When he returned to his seat after half-time, he was booed mercilessly. Harrison has been absent from his regular seats at the Mavericks but obviously though he could find some peace watching local college team SMU play Pitt. Hewas duly booed by SMU fans.Harrison was fortunate enough to inherit Dončić, Brunson and Porziņģis when he took over. None of them remain. He fumbled all three, letting them go for a pittance in return. Nelson’s 2018 draft masterpiece – landing both Dončić (in a deal with Atlanta) and Brunson (with the 33rd pick!) – should be a contender for the bestNBAdraft ever. Instead, it has become a tragic tale of squandered potential thanks to Harrison’s mismanagement. Once a mecca for Mavs fans to express their jubilation, the AAC has become an empty, oppressive shell. Fans who have expressed discontent have been thrown out. Arena employees aren’t allowing shirts, signs or imagery criticizing the team through the entrance. The one metric Mavs fans always pointed to in their defense against being a poorly run franchise – Dončić – is gone.Dallas fans’ anger will continue to burn until the franchise acknowledges their pain, a move unlikely ever to come. After all, if ownership hasn’t cared about pushback over funding Trump orsupporting the Israeli governmentduring a genocide, why would it give two damns about Mavericks fans?Explore more on these topicsDallas MavericksNBADallasBasketballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Either way, he was healthy and happy for the first time in a while, after his half-season loan to Nottingham Forest had been a bust. He was still only 21 but seemed to have matured. He had just gotten engaged. The beef with US national team coach Gregg Berhalter was behind him –that whole sordid dealwhen Gio’s parents sparked a civil war within American soccer with ugly allegations against Berhalter around the 2022 World Cup.He had dazzled, finally reemerging as the Reyna of old, at the Concacaf Nations League Finals in March, where he was named player of the tournament after guiding the US to a third straight title. He seemed perfectly positioned to make his mark on the Copa América. Instead the tournamentturned into a debacle for the US. Reyna played plenty, but the host country eventually faced a group-stage elimination-cum-humiliation.Nine months later, Reyna is back to the same place where he has spent so much of his five years as a first-team professional: playing marginal minutes atBorussia Dortmund. At a big club, but not quite big-time. Almost breaking through but never exactly getting the timing or the opportunities right. Threatening to become, as the Dutch call it, an “eternal prospect.”Dortmund’s season is spiralling out of control after own goals on and off pitch | Andy BrassellRead moreRemember the 2020-21 season, when Reyna, who turned 18 that year, formed an effervescent foursome of forwards with a few other hot prospects? Those colleagues: Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland and Jadon Sancho. That feels like a long time ago.On Saturday, Reyna substituted into Dortmund’s dreary 2-1 loss to Stuttgart in the 85th minute, just before Julian Ryerson was sent off and reduced the home side to 10 men. Reyna had six touches in the late chaos as he and his teammatesdesperately tried to arrest their downward spiral. This came a week after his previous appearance, when he played all of four minutes and communed with the ball only four times after coming on in the 88th minute at Heidenheim. He has made just one Bundesliga start this season and logged 175 minutes – on a team that has faceplanted to 11th place with a what-is-gong-on-here goal difference of +1.On Tuesday, in Dortmund’s 3-0 dismantling of Sporting in the first leg of theirChampions Leagueknockout phase playoffs, Reyna didn’t play at all. He was seen jogging along the sideline and joining in on the goal celebrations of others.Time is a flat circle, it seems. A flash of brilliance. An injury. A dearth of playing time. And on and on. But the connective tissue in his still-pretty-young career has been less untapped potential than plain bad luck. If there were some advanced metric that correlated talent to misfortune, Reyna might be one of the world’s leading players in the category – enough that we might call this new stat xGio.Over the course of the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons alone, Reynamissed 386 days to 10 different injuries– more than a year in all. The start of his 2023-24 season was derailed by a hairline fracture in his fibula that cost him the first month of the season. This season, a groin strain ruled him out from early September through late November, a 13-game stretch. It’s become something of a tradition: spending the fall, and the crucial opening months of the new campaign, beset by injuries.The upshot is as predictable as the cadence of muscle problems – because other than the break in his shin, Reyna’s injuries tend to be hamstring or groin issues. By the time Reyna is back to full fitness, he is buried deep down the depth chart in all of the various attacking positions he can play, since Dortmund develop wingers and attacking midfielders on an industrial scale. If he has a role at all, it’s most often been as a super sub. The most minutes Reyna has played for Dortmund since his high mark of 2,698 minutes in 2020-21 is a mere 1,016 minutes, back in 2022-23.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAll of this may have been less to do with Reyna himself than his simply getting sucked down into the muck of Dortmund’s incurable fecklessness. In the five years and a few weeks since Reyna made hisBundesligadebut, Dortmund have made six managerial changes – tellingly appointing Edin Terzić ad interim once and permanently twice. Judging from his first two matches in charge, Niko Kovač, the new man in charge, isn’t inclined to lean heavily on Reyna just yet.It’s the same kind of unfortunate timing that fairly ruined Reyna’s first World Cup. In all that time he was out injured, Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah established themselves as Berhalter’s nailed-down starters on the wings. Meanwhile, the midfield trio of Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah and Tyler Adams became so coherent and incontrovertible that it earned a collective nickname, MMA. Midfields with a moniker don’t get broken up. Reyna was left out of the lineup for the business end of that cycle. His frustration at the World Cup turned to petulance, which unleashed all that drama.Coaches tend to come around to Reyna eventually. Kovač may yet. But until such a time, Reyna appears to be the wrong man at the wrong place and the wrong time, having to start over.

I offered up my dreams to find outTara KennyAI chatbots have a tendency to exaggerate, but their verbose nature feels well-suited to the  highly associative task of dream analysisThu 13 Feb 2025 17.55 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 18.06 ESTShareSome say thattalking about your dreams is boring, but personally I think otherworldly nocturnal escapades provide far richer fodder for small talk than the footy season or this unseasonal weather. Sadly, not everyone agrees. That’s why, when I hear about an AI dream interpretation app, I’m seduced by the potential for a captive, preternaturally intelligent assistant to help me decipher the more baffling corners of my psyche.AI chatbots such as ChatGPT have a well-known tendency to riff and exaggerate with alarming confidence, but their verbose nature feels well-suited to the free form and highly associative task of dream analysis. Admittedly, tradinglittle understood fragments of our slumbering mindsto a tech startup in return for spiritual guidance sounds like the foreboding premise of a terrifying sci-fi horror movie. But the app’s fine print promises that dreams are stored “safely and privately”. Who am I to let an intuitive aversion to welcoming the machine into the last private vestiges of my consciousness get in the way of a good story?AI isn’t about unleashing our imaginations, it’s about outsourcing them. The real purpose is profitRead moreI download the app, punch in a recent, seemingly benign dream – I visit the supermarket to complain about a “defective condiment”, an apathetic checkout worker dismisses my concerns, and I brazenly spread stolen peanut butter on a piece of toast – and hit the “interpret” magic wand. “Dreaming ties all mankind together,” the app responds, spouting Jack Kerouac like a bad Tinder date, before proposing that my dream might allude to feelings of dissatisfaction and powerlessness, as well as a desire to assert myself. It’s convincing, if uninspired. A clear-eyed analysis of my dream scenario with none of the hallucinatory fervour I came here for.3:32You can make songs in seconds with Suno AI. We test if they're actually good – videoHoping to elicit deeper revelations, I goad the AI with some more troubling vignettes. In one, I’m ostensibly helping the police to catch a murderer, while secretly sending him flirtatious texts, seemingly playing them both. The app sees an inner conflict between morality and an attraction to danger. In another, I’m lost, manically careening through a hotel in search of my husband and baby; I pass a heaving dancefloor, a woman making strange, guttural noises, and an idyllic beach that, upon closer inspection, is just a mirage. Apparently, all this rich imagery amounts to a potential conflict between my own desires and societal expectations. Gentle food for thought, but hardly illuminating.To the developers’ credit, the AI is annoyingly even-keeled: it avoids absolutes, reminds me that dreams have multiple meanings and recommends therapy should my dreams begin to get the better of me.... my dreams cease entirely, giving the eerie sense that my subconscious is on strikeThe only thing that catches me off guard are the strange, AI-generated visuals; the hotel quest conjures a pair of dancing potatoes and the inexplicable phrase “PLE8T PABET”. In contrast, when I share this dream with an in-person community of dream enthusiasts, their insights are genuinely surprising, from noting my strong sense of purpose throughout the quest to observing how unease in a hotel setting evokes films such as The Shining and Lost in Translation.While the app doesn’t exactly shatter and rebuild my sense of self, it has some handy functionalities, such as the ability to identify and search recurring symbols in your dreams. (Try filtering years of handwritten journals for “mother”.) And it’s certainly convenient to grasp for my phone to catch fleeting, early-morning dream fragments, though I still find myself transcribing these digitised dreams back into my diary.Part of the pleasure of traversing my dreamscape is the ritual element of morning pages over a coffee. The warm glow of the screen kills the romance, especially as I invariably end up on another corner of my phone, spiritually further away from any potential revelations. Perhaps my dream practice is meant to be tactile and reflective, rather than efficient and gamified.Artificial intelligence – is it bad? Yes. But on the other hand it is also terrible | First Dog on the MoonRead moreDays later, while I’m pondering what might be lost to humanity should we collectively opt to train algorithms on these sacred messages from our psyches (and wondering what I might inadvertently reveal about myself in writing this article), I have a vivid, alarming dream. I’m standing in front of an audience, preparing to do a presentation on dreams, when a figure from my past interrupts and threatens to read from the dream journal I’ve carelessly left on my seat. Filled with rage, I force him to recite from his own dream diary, which he does in a silly goblin voice. “Don’t you like me any more? I thought you once loved me?” he presses. The AI interpretation confirms what I already know: my dreams are shy, demure and resolute that at least some of my private interior landscape should remain that way.In the coming days, my dreams cease entirely, giving the eerie sense that my subconscious is on strike, refusing to clock back on until I promise not to sell it out to AI. Unable to conceive of the drudgery of a life without dreams, I delete the app and any trace of my dream data with it. I uploaded my dreams to AI and all I got was the revelation that my subconscious is a tech-averse luddite.Tara Kenny is an arts and culture writer based in Naarm/MelbourneExplore more on these topicsSleepOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

At least Chamberlain was trying to prevent a major European war, whereas Trump is acting in the middle of one. Trump’s “Munich” (synonymous in English with the 1938 deal in which Britain and France sold out Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany) comes on the eve of the big security conference in today’s Bavarian capital, where his emissaries will meet western allies. That Munich security conference must be the beginning of a decisive European response, learning from our own tragic history in order to avoid repeating it.The next step Trump proposes is in effect a new “Yalta” (referring to the February 1945 US-Soviet-UK summit in the Crimean resort of Yalta, which has become synonymous with superpowers deciding the fate of European countries over their heads). In this case, his proposal is that the US and Russia should decide the fate ofUkrainewith marginal if any involvement of Ukraine or other European countries. But this time the occupants of the White House and the Kremlin should meet first in Saudi Arabia, then in their respective capitals, while it seems the actual Yalta, in the Crimea, is to be ceded to Russia. For in the brave new world of Trump and Putin, might is right and territorial expansion is what great powers do, be it Russia to Ukraine, the US to Canada and Greenland – or China to Taiwan.All historical analogies have their limits and those with “Munich” and “Yalta” have been overused. But here, for once, they do feel apposite – so long as we highlight differences as well as similarities.For a few weeks after Trump’s election we had a faint hope that when it came to Ukraine his administration would follow its proclaimed motto of “peace through strength”, understanding that strength is the only language Putin comprehends. Now we see that Trump not only bullies his country’s friends but sucks up to his country’s enemies.This so-called strongman is actually a weak man when it comes to confronting the hostile authoritarians of this world. In just one day, he has made four large, unnecessary and damaging concessions. First, he has not just initiated exploratory talks with Putin via an intermediary, which would be defensible, but personally given the Russian dictator fulsome and sycophantic recognition as a world leader. “We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations,” he reported of their long phone call, in asocial media post. They discussed “the great benefit that we will someday have in working together. But first, as we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.” Imagine if in 1941, instead of entering the war against Nazi Germany on the side of Britain and other allied European nations, the president of the United States had rung up Hitler, reflected on “the Great History of our Nations”, and then talked about jointly ending “the War with Germany/Britain”.Second, he has offered the Russian leader a bilateral US-Russian negotiation over the heads of the Ukrainians, precisely the kind of new Yalta that Putin has always wanted. And then, third and fourth, he has declared that Ukraine will almost certainlyhave to concede territoryand that the US will not support its membership of Nato. Both those things have been said privately in Washington and other western capitals for some time, but publicly conceding them upfront is a masterclass in hownotto practise the “art of the deal”. (He did something similar in negotiations with the Taliban over Afghanistan, starting rather than ending with a timetable for US withdrawal.) Historians now have the notes and recollections of those close to Hitler, documenting his delight at the deal he exacted from Chamberlain. One day, we may have similar evidence of Putin’s private glee at the concessions made by Trump.This doesn’t mean there will be anything deserving the name of peace any time soon. The Kremlin’s first public readout from the Trump-Putin call was notably cautious, warning that it is “essential to settle the reasons for the conflict”. Probably Putin’s ideal scenario would be to keep talking peace with Trump, through a series of leisurely summits in Saudi Arabia, the US and Russia, while Russia continues to press forward on the battlefield, demolish Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and undermine its economy, society and political unity in other ways. (Asked about the involvement of Ukraine in the talks, Trump mentioned the need for a presidential election there, thus parroting a Russian attack line on the legitimacy of presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy.)There’s one huge difference between Europe at the time of the original Munich and Yalta, and Europe now. Today’s Europe is rich, free, democratic and a closely integrated community of partners and allies. Yes, as recent polling by the European Council on Foreign Relations again demonstrates, it’s alsodivided and confusedabout the best way forward for Ukraine. But with a sufficiently determined coalition of willing and capable countries, definitely including Britain, Europe can still enable Ukraine to stabilise the frontline, hold up economically and eventually get to negotiate from strength, not weakness. That’s why this weekend’s Munich security conference must be the beginning of a European riposte to Trump’s Munich.Timothy Garton Ash is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

History has some answersNeal ShasoreWhatever stands in the tower’s footprint should be inspired by the community – and remind us that such a tragedy must never happen againThu 13 Feb 2025 09.48 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 09.52 ESTShareFor the past seven years, Grenfell Tower has been cloaked in white wrapping, protecting the fire-damaged fabric from further corrosion and the public from falling debris. This shroud covers a monumental cenotaph, a visceral reminder of the tragedy that claimed 72 lives and upended so many others. Now, the deputy prime minister has decided thatthe tower will be demolishedin time for the 10th anniversary of the fire in 2027. The justification is that the tower is structurally vulnerable, and – insipidly – because there is no consensus among the community groups and campaigns seeking reparative justice.Many of these groups have said theyfelt ignoredby the government’s decision, whilelocal residents remain divided. What is clear is that a top-down verdict from central government has obscured some of the careful thinking and deep engagement by various communities at a local level. As attention turns toward the construction of a permanent memorial, there are questions as to whether this can be handled with the appropriate sensitivity and proper consultation.Early signs, based on the government’s ruling, are that the system has not fundamentally been reformed. Decisions about a memorial to Grenfell will have a particular potency because the redevelopment of the site will be a measure of how the construction industry and regulatory regime have changed since the tragedy, from planning and procurement, design and construction, to management and maintenance.All of these processes should by now be practically inverted if we’ve achieved the shift needed: community-led, bottom-up planning; procurement based solely on quality, with clear and accountable contractual relationships; health, safety, accessibility and sustainability as primary considerations; a process of production that engages local skills and enhances the local economy; and – as the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission, made up of residents and survivors, advocates – a speedy transfer of ownership from government to an appropriate independent body. The government hascommitted to this, if that is the wish of the community, and an organisation will be set up to own and maintain it.Memorialisation and the design of monuments is a complicated process,as the continuing controversy around agreeing an appropriate site, form and purpose for theUK’s national Holocaust memorialdemonstrated. Theanti-monumentalismof the postwar years rejected themonolithic memorials that reflected the bombast and sublimity so favoured by despotic regimes. In London, this turn away from the grandiose has manifested in thefourth plinth commissions, but also more modestly and movingly in sites likeAltab Ali park, Whitechapel, where the racist murder of a young Bangladeshi textile worker in 1978 is commemorated by a decorative arch.Monuments to ordinary communities made extraordinary through disaster are as rare as they are difficult to design. But we can look to history for inspiration. Take the Victorian artist George Frederic Watts’s commitment to a Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice, situated in Postman’s Park, essentially a veranda designed by Ernest George with beautifully crafted ceramic tablets commemorating ordinary people who died selflessly saving the lives of others. More than half a century later, theLondoncounty council created a memorial to Londoners who had died during the blitz by creating an avenue of mature trees running between old County Hall and Waterloo Bridge on the South Bank.View image in fullscreenThe Memorial To Heroic Self-Sacrifice, by George Frederic Watts, in Postman’s Park in the City of London.Photograph: View Pictures/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesRuins and relics can also have their own potency: the medieval structure of Coventry Cathedral was badly damaged by a Luftwaffe raid. The architect Basil Spence retained what remained of the structure as a garden of remembrance, adjacent to his striking contemporary cathedral.The independent Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission, which is supported by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, has advanced the commissioning process byshortlisting a number of design teams, a refreshingly diverse list of practitioners in architecture and adjacent disciplines. Whoever is appointed, it will be daunting task and a weighty responsibility, with complex long-term considerations.Though the aspiration is that the official memorial will be permanent, it should also be able to evolve. The meaning and cultural memory of Grenfell will inevitably change, in ways we are unlikely to anticipate. The Victorians liked sturdy, fixed monuments – in our contemporary moment, this kind of heroic memorialisation simply does not cater to the diverse views and needs of the community or the public. The Monument in the City of London – it is easy to forget – commemorates the Great Fire of 1666, and its messages about the causes of the fire and the power relations that informed the City’s reconstruction represent avery specific historical contextnow largely forgotten.Further, even though the tower will be demolished, aspects of it should be preserved. When the architects Alison and Peter Smithson’s brutalist landmark housing scheme Robin Hood Gardens was finally consigned to the rubble heap, the V&A Museum was challenged to preserve a three-storey section in its collection. With appropriate supporting displays and interpretation, there could be a similar approach in keeping some of the fabric of Grenfell.Forensic Architecture, meanwhile, has not only sought to accurately record the tower’s structure and the technical failures it endured, but also developed “situated testimonies” in collaboration with residents, bereaved families and survivors.Angela Rayner defends handling of meeting with Grenfell survivors and familiesRead moreThe memorial provides an opportunity to commemorate the profound change that Grenfell has and must continue to have on how our cities and buildings are shaped. Academics like Liam Ross in Edinburgh have undertaken detailed research around what he terms “pyrotechnic cities”, the ways in which buildings and the urban condition have been shaped by fire and resulting regulatory or practical changes, including in North Kensington. Ross undertakes an “archaeology of fire”, observing the process of “concretising existing codes in new structures”. True memorialisation of disaster involves revising standards. Over the past three years, Ross and I have collaborated on designing ashort learning programmeaimed at arming professionals with deeper knowledge of fire and life safety, conceived as a memorial and a platform for change.There are already many memorials to Grenfell, driven by those most affected by the fire and on the frontline of campaigning. They remind us that memorialisation is not a passive or indeed singular act. Even if the tower were to remain, its potency as a symbol would depend on fundamental shifts in the way we think about our buildings and cities. A memorial should not and cannot be a “national” monument for gawping at, but a nodal point of a shared and renewed commitment to ensure such a tragedy never happens again.Neal Shasore is a historian of the built environment and heritage advocateDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was invented by greetings card companies. It is a cynical attempt to commodify love. It’s exclusionary. It’s sappy. It fosters misery. It’s completely unnecessary. And, above all, I like it.Valentine’s Day is perhaps the world’s most hated holiday. Marked each year by intense pressure, overhyped marketing campaigns and all-too-often dashed hopes. But get this, maybe it’s nice. Did you think about that? No, you didn’t. You only think about yourself. No wonder you’re so lonely this Valentine’s Day. Sorry, sorry, you pushed me and I went way too far. I apologise unreservedly. Please allow me to explain.Becoming a migrant was the best thing I’ve ever done – I was lucky that it was by choice | Bertin HuynhRead moreThere are some criticisms of Valentine’s Day that hold no water for me. Oh, it’s a made-up holiday, is it? Unlike all those other organic holidays that grow straight out of the ground? You know the king’s birthday holiday isn’t actually on the king’s birthday, yeah? Also, that kings are a thing we made up when we wanted to convince an odd man to wear a funny hat.It’s pure capitalism – yes, fair cop, it absolutely is maintained and then exploited by capitalism every year, not unlike – and hold on to your funny little hat, Mr King – every single other thing in our society. It becomes incumbent upon us to think of ways to divorce the day from this fact, to express love for those around us in ways that don’t require pointless purchases. (Also, I am sorry for using divorce as a verb in an article about Valentine’s Day. I’m really just sticking the boot in, aren’t I?)Then, there’s the most annoying criticism, the one probably already being typed out in the comments section by someone who read the headline, skipped the article and raced to make this tedious brag.We don’t need Valentine’s Day, we celebrate each other every day. First, gross. Also, yuck. Placing the nasty mental image you have given me aside, may I say, la-di-freaking-da for you, oh perfect couple, but some of us can get a little grumbly in the mornings or a little too tied up in our work every so often and it’s nice to hand over a fistful of flowers and tell someone that you really do love them and it is an everlasting surprise that they can still find a way to love you, considering all the things you do and the person you are.I live in a forest my parents planted when I was a child. It’s not too late for you to grow one too | Jessie ColeRead moreThat is not to say that I believe Valentine’s Day has to be celebrated in a traditional way. You don’t need flowers or chocolates. You don’t need a card. You don’t even need to be celebrating romantic love. For years now we’ve seen popularised celebrations of“Galentine’s Day”, where women will express their love for their close friends. It seems like a wholesome and beautiful thing. I have to cop to a little jealousy – for such affection to be shared between modern men we usually have to both be present for a particularly beautifully worked goal at a sporting event.All I am saying is that in a world where everything is pretty dark and awful most of the time, and where it is entirely possible to take a cynical and dismissive view of just about every attempt made by major brands to make you feel an emotion for their eventual profit, I like the idea that we can have one day where, in our own little way, however we choose to do it, and to whomever we choose to do it with, we can say that I am grateful for you, I love you and I feel very lucky to be able to experience that love.For myself, I am very lucky to find myself, against all odds, in a life filled with love. I have spent my share of Valentine’s Days looking in the restaurant window from the outside, and I feel so grateful to have someone in my life that makes every day feel special, and as such deserves at least one special day to celebrate that.Now, do we feel like this writing article counts as a present or do I actually need to go and get something?James Colley is a comedy writer from Sydney.

But where is the money going – and are audiences benefiting too?Thu 13 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 12.51 ESTShareEuropean film is booming. Really. In spite of the disruption caused by the pandemic to production and release schedules, film productions on the continent have increased by more than 50% over the past decade. Some of these new films will premiere at theBerlin film festival, which opens today, or Cannes and Venice later in the year. Those who don’t manage to get a slot at the “big three” can still hope for red-carpet treatment: the submission platform FilmFreeway records more than 600 new European film festivals for this year alone.There is a less shiny flipside to the golden decade of European film, however. Since 2011, the growth in film productionshas not been matchedby a similar growth in audiences, meaning fewer moviegoers per film. In economics, increasing choices through product differentiation – offering more options to cater to diverse tastes – usually boosts demand. But for European cinema, the increase in production has not translated into more ticket sales. The French director Jacques Audiard’s Emilia Pérez feels like a symptomatic film in this regard, irrespective of therecent controversyaround its star’s social media comments. It was a jury-prize winner at Cannes, hyped as an arthouse-to-mainstream crossover hit with a triumphant night at the European film awards – and hasmostly left cinemagoers cold.There could be many reasons for this, such as market saturation, competition from blockbusters, or the winner-takes-all nature of the film market, where a small number of films draw the most viewers and prizes. Another explanation may stem from the increased concentration of resources and power – an industry with no incentive to care about its audience.Whoever walks home from the Berlinale with the Golden Bear on 22 February, the biggest winner of the festival will be the EU. Through its Creative Europe Media (Mesures pour Encourager le Développement de l’Industrie Audiovisuelle)programme, it supports14 filmsfeatured in this year’s event. It backs the Berlinale’s industry hubs – the European Film Market, the Co-Production Market and the World Cinema Fund. It supports Berlinale Talents, a networking platform for emerging film-makers.Members of Europa Cinemas, a Media-financed network of film theatres, will be attending the festival in search of movies for their screens. There will be actors as part of Media’s European Shooting Stars, festival directors as part of its Networks of EuropeanFestivals, and critics from the Media-funded film journal Cineuropa. For professionals who cannot make it, films can be watched again on Festival Scope, Media’s platform for film programmers.Few aspects of film-making – training, promotion, production, distribution, marketing – are left untouched by Europe’s largest film fund. The initiative commands a staggering €1.4bn (£1.2bn) budget for the 2021-27 period. Media’s mission is as ambitious as its budget: itaims to support“cultural diversity” and “artistic value”, while strengthening competitiveness in a global market.The concentration of resources and power especially applies to the festival landscape. Major festivals such as the Berlinale, Cannes and Venice command vast funds, media attention and industry influence. On the other hand, it is estimated that more than two-thirds of the festivals registered on FilmFreeway will not last the duration of the Media programme. As anyone who has ever worked for such festivals can attest, the rewards – whether symbolic or financial – are slim and the workload infinite. Meanwhile, the Berlinale directors earnsix-figure salaries.Such imbalances are not only a result of winner-takes-all dynamics. “Networks” can also work as gatekeepers. Delegates from influential organisations such as Europa Cinemas seldom attend smaller events. Without industry presence or the resources to scout, smaller festivals struggle to secure premieres and often end up recycling movies that larger festivals have already deemed secondary.This creates a vicious cycle: reaching wider audiences requires passing through a labyrinthine bureaucracy controlled by gatekeepers, and films that fail to do so risk being overlooked entirely. As a dumping ground for less successful films, smaller venues cannot build an identity that could matter outside the festival bubble. As a result, the film world turns inward, addressing the needs of its own members at the expense of the wider public.A concentrated control of resources creates barriers that prevent their effective and equitable use. Take the launch of Media’sEuropean Film Club. According to the website, the aim is to provide a platform for young people to come together to watch and discuss European films. Though the programme is intended to foster grassroots initiatives, its partners include some of the usual suspects: national film centres, film schools and festivals such as the Austrian Film Academy, the Sarajevo film festival and the British Film Institute. How exactly these institutions qualify as film clubs is questionable. So, too, is the idea that they will attract more audiences.Where consumer demand is lacking, positive media attention steps in to help. In a recent study, my co-author, Antonios Lagarias, and Iexamined the impactof public funding on film criticism, using sentiment analysis and machine learning to assess if the reviews of the Media-funded platform Cineuropa align with the commercial success of European films. Our findings show that Cineuropa’s reviews are significantly more positive than those of major industry outlets such as Variety and the Hollywood Reporter, leading to an overestimation of the films’ popularity. Despite being framed as a source of film criticism, Cineuropa’s institutional links compromise its objectivity. As we show, such misleading signals represent unfair commercial practices and may risk the crowding out of films that people want to see.The website of Media Germanycelebrates the organisation’s presenceat the Berlinale as nothing less ambitious than to foster “synergies, sustainability strategies, competitiveness and new business models”. The EU may dream about films for Europeans, by Europeans, about Europe. But at the heart of such visions lies a trilemma. Meeting any two of these goals undermines the third: films that resonate with European audiences and are crafted by European film-makers may not focus on European themes; films about Europe that are made by local talent may not attract European viewers. True diversity may not be possible when all of these goals are pursued at once and under the auspices of a single institution.History shows that top-heavy approaches to cultural production have led to suppression of diversity and the silencing of artists who did not conform. The Media programme concentrates power and influence when it allocates vast resources to select institutions. Instead of fostering diversity, this makes European cinema resemble a monoculture controlled by those who manage or are closest to the funds. While the EU is the biggest winner at the Berlinale, the biggest loser might just be the audience.Moritz Pfeifer is a film critic and research fellow at Leipzig University’s Institute of Economic PolicyExplore more on these topicsFilmOpinionBerlin film festivalFestivalsEuropeEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

Last year, it sparked another gold rush – and looming calamity for local authoritiesThu 13 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 06.56 ESTSharePerhaps only England could make its politician of the moment a woman who died more than a decade ago. Yet turn on Channel 4 and watch Margaret Thatcher: the drama. Radio 4 offers Margaret Thatcher: the play, while soon you can enjoy Thatcher: the opera. For those who can’t wait, there’s Thatcher: the news story, as the British media celebrates 50 years this week since she was crowned Tory leader.Such pieces are reliably more fascinated by how she looked (Shoulder pads! Handbag!Blondhalo!) than what she did. So let me tell you a story about one of Thatcher’s deeds that shapes how we live today. Rather than some dusty tale dug out of the archive, it’s unfolding right now. And you won’t have seen it in any other newspaper.At its heart is that flagship of Thatcherism: the right to buy. Her single biggest privatisation, it allowed tenants of homes built and owned by the public to buy them at a bargain price. Launched in 1980, the policy remains in force today – although its heyday was thought to be long past. Until, that is,Keir Starmerbecame prime minister.Among the first acts of Starmer’s government was to slash the discount available to council tenants wanting to buy their homes. In London, the cut is especially sharp: before the deadline of 21 November2024, the markdown could be as much as £136,400; now it is £16,000. It’s a good move, squeezing demand and all but choking Thatcher’s policy to death. It’s also a dramatic move – but just how dramatic is not public. To find out, I sent freedom of information requests to every London council.You may think you know what’s coming next. Perhaps you figure that, as the deadline loomed, there was a stream of interest. Wrong: there was no stream; there was a deluge.Of the 32 London boroughs, 27 responded. After analysing their results, I can reveal:Brent saw a more than 7,000% rise in right-to-buy (RTB) applications in November over the month before; in Lambeth and Camden, it was more than 2,000%, for Southwark, 1,500%.November’s flood of applications means Lewisham is dealing with more bids this financial year than it received in the previous four years put together, while Hackney is managing the equivalent of more than three years’ worth of would-be buyers.Islington got 922 RTB applications in November alone, where it would normally expect closer to 200 over an entire year.With months still left of this financial year, London authorities have together already received 3.5 times the RTB applications they got last year.Whether north or south of the river, inner city or outer suburb, the pattern is unmistakable and stark. Battered by years of cuts, besieged by the spending pressures local authorities now face, as I heard on phone call after phone call, there has been “an explosion” in applications; a “staggering” number of bids; “unprecedented” demand. Just look at this chart, and the map, showing right-to-buy applications over the course of this year. They basically flatline until November – then they rocket.Chart of right to buy applicationsMap of applicationsAt London’s largest council landlord, Southwark, where more than 1,300 bids flooded in over the first three weeks of November, they’re drafting in extra staff to handle the fraud checks and other formalities, so the team can swell to twice its usual size. Despite that and the legal deadlines, they told me they estimate it will take more than 19 weeks simply to get through the first stages.What these boroughs are describing is low-level chaos, and it is by no means confined to London. In other big cities, councils are facing the same thing: a blizzard of paperwork too large for staff to handle, a good proportion of dodgy or flawed bids, and no certainty at all about how many council homes are flogged off at the end of it all. Take as an example Lewisham where, over the past couple of years, about half of all RTB applications have resulted in sales. Apply that same ratio to bids received last November alone, and at a stroke the borough will lose almost as many council homes as the total it has built since 2020.Call it Thatcher’s hangover: the good times, if that’s what they were, wore off long ago and now all that’s left is a dusty thudding in the head and costs that never stop rising. Her most famous policy, right to buy, shows how the hangover never stops. Public money was spent on building those homes; public money was lost through giving them away cheap; and public money is now funnelled in housing benefit to the landlords who let them out.Last November’s gold rush exposes how cynical those homilies about a property-owning democracy always were. Property owning? For some, but for others try: property flipping, property renting, property accumulating – done on the cheap with taxpayers’ cash. While the private sector keeps raking it in, the public sector is deprived of rental income and forced into ever more desperate measures to house tenants. In my own London borough of Enfield, families with nowhere else to live arenow shipped offto ex-mining villages in County Durham.At Southwark, they reckon they’ve lost 16,000 homes over the decades through right to buy. About half of those are now rented out privately to tenants who might otherwise have got them from the council, with cheaper rents and more secure contracts. “By depriving councils of homes, right to buy takes away the security that allows kids to finish school or their parents to keep their jobs,” says Southwark council’s leader, Kieron Williams. “The rise in homelessness is more or less a direct result of right to buy.”Starmerism is a small and ever-shrinking puddle of ideas, but it retains an emphasis on building stuff: infrastructure, homes, new towns. Ministers talk big numbers about housebuilding, yet they refuse to set targets on council housebuilding. Starmer focuses on housing supply, about which the far more politically savvy Thatcher didn’t give a monkey’s. She cared only about demand – demand fromherpeople, her voters, who in turn rewarded her with three election victories. Without the aid of a focus group, Starmer’s team barely know who their people are. They won’t come out and argue for more council homes. At best, they’ll do the right thing, but by stealth, in the small print, where they’ll hope GB News never finds it.But you need more than this comedy of errors – shoving a terrible policy off-stage, sparking yet another huge selloff in the process and inducing another drop in council housing. You really need an alternative. At Wandsworth council, Aydin Dikerdem is the cabinet lead for housing. While not opposing right to buy, he talks about the need to build council homes, to expand notions of what the public realm can provide.“My mum and dad lived on a council estate, and my mum was a teacher. Today that would be totally utopian,” he says. “But it wasn’t a generation ago. Within a generation, we’ve lost a sense of public assets and public housing. But that means we can also get it back in a generation.”Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionHousingMargaret ThatcherCommunitiesKeir StarmerLabourConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

Why is it still treated with colonial arrogance?Rokhaya DialloThe Indian Ocean island is an integral part of France and the EU – but the aftermath of a devastating cyclone has highlighted its neglectThu 13 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 13 Feb 2025 03.35 ESTShareImagine waking up to horrifying images of a region of France reduced to ruins after an extreme overnight weather event. We don’t have to imagine it, because it happened in December. Tropical cyclones don’t usually strike inEurope, but this one levelled a Frenchdépartement.France’s colonial history made that possible.Mayotte, situated in the Indian Ocean between Mozambique and Madagascar, is part of the former French colonial empire. It has been a French overseas collectivity since the 1970s and was made a department of France in 2011. As such it is an integral part of the EU, too.Cyclone Chidoravaged the islandon 14 December, exposing socioeconomic conditions that should be utterly unacceptable for the seventh-richest country in the world. Theworst natural catastropheexperienced in France for almost a century was devastating, but it was the longstanding neglect of France’s poorest region that made its impact a great deal worse.About 77%of Mayotte’s population live below the national poverty line, compared with 14% in metropolitan France, which would be unacceptable in any region on the European mainland. At least 37% of Mahoran women and 25% of men aged 15 and above havenever attended school. About60% of the populationlive without basic sanitary facilities, often in overcrowdedbidonvilles: informal settlements built from salvaged materials such as corrugated metal sheets, wood and plastic. Severe droughts have left people facingunprecedented water shortages. Given these precarious living conditions, it’s not hard to imagine the cyclone’s catastrophic impact.An aerial view of Mamoudzou before and after Cyclone Chido.An aerial view of Mamoudzou before and after Cyclone Chido.In Mamoudzou, the main city, most of the buildings were destroyed. As for human casualties, there were39 deaths reportedand thousands of people were injured. However, the death toll could still reach thousands, because many people remain unaccounted for as a result of the extensive destruction of informal settlements.Two months after the disaster, Mayotte has faded from the international headlines. But the devastation has not, with the human misery exacerbated by treacherous mudslides.Against this calamity, the entire political class in France might have been expected to articulate national support and solemnity, but the most visible face of the French republic failed to show basic respect. A couple of days after the tragedy, France’s new prime minister, François Bayrou,opted to skipan emergency meeting on Mayotte in Paris so he could chair a meeting of the city council in the south-western French city of Pau, where he also serves as mayor.Like Bayrou, Emmanuel Macron made a flying visit to Mayotte, where he came face to face with the understandable frustration of traumatised people who felt abandoned. But the president did not seem in listening mode. Heshouted and used foul language, before patronising a woman who heckled him, reminding her how lucky the people of Mayotte were to be in France. “Because if this weren’t France, you’d be 10,000 times more in deep shit!” As clips of this insulting exchange circulated, many islanders expressedshock at the tone of Macron’s outburst.The contemptuous response of France’s most senior officials was not an aberration. Rather, it reflects France’s attitude to its former colonies, now overseas territories, whose people are expected to feel only gratitude. Much was made in the French media of Bayrou’s “ambitious”pledge to rebuildMayotte, but Saïd Omar Oili an elected representative for MayottequitMacron’s group in the senate in protest at the timidity of the response. Why should Mahorans, whose territory has been French since 1841, be more grateful than people from Nice and Savoie – who only became French in 1860? Would any politician treat a department on the mainland as if France were a gift to them?In fact, France has a strong interest in maintaining its presence globally. Despite its modest size, France boasts the world’ssecond-largestmaritime domain thanks to its overseas territories. Mayotte plays a crucial role because of the rich biodiversity of its ecosystem.More significantly, its strategic geographic position between Africa and Asia, in a region where major powers compete for influence, serves as a key military base for French armed forces. The island provides a specialised training groundfor military exercises tailored to tropical and island-based interventions.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron speaks to local people in Tsingoni, Mayotte, 20 December 2024.Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty ImagesYet Mayotte is still a disputed territory. In a1974 referendum, the archipelago of islands that make up Comoros voted strongly in favour of independence from France (95%). But on the island of Mayotte, 63%of voters chose to remain under French control. France then split off Mayotte and organised a separate referendum there in 1976, in which the island voted again to remain part of the French republic. The UN general assembly condemned these referendums, declaring themnull and void. The African Union has labelled France’s conduct an “unlawful occupation”.France insists that it is giving Mahorans what they want. But what is the point of making Mayotte a department, and therefore an integral part ofFrance, if it is not accorded the same standards as the rest of the country?Legislation is supposed to align with national norms, yetnumerous exemptions remain. Theminimum wage in Mayotte is24% lower than the national rate, and a solidarity income for those without earnings is half the national rate.To deter migrants from neighbouring, even poorer, Comoros, immigration laws in Mayotte are far stricter than in mainland France.According to theLeague of Human Rights(Ligue des Droits de l’Homme), these measures amount to “serious violations of fundamental rights”.This is the neglectful context in which the cyclone struck meaning that many of its calamitous consequences could have been avoided. Countless official documents, statements from NGOs and social movements had previously sounded the alarm. Last year, the French national assemblyreleased a reporton the unique vulnerabilities of French territories, including Mayotte, to climate breakdown. Highlighting climate vulnerability, water scarcity, socioeconomic disparities and infrastructure deficiencies, the report’s alarming tone should have urged the authorities to act, especially because thehealthcare system is deficient. In 2022, a French senatedocumentdescribed Mayotte’s healthcare system as “at breaking point”.As the effects of the climate emergency hit harder and more unpredictably in the future, will France do anything differently for its citizens in the overseas departments? The continuing neglect suggests not. Manuel Valls, the recently appointed minister of the overseas, has no specific expertise. A former prime minister, he oncemistakenly placed Réunion Islandin the Pacific Ocean instead of the Indian Ocean. Hispast commentson deporting the Roma community from France don’t inspire confidence in the government’s consideration of its overseas citizens.And Macron, apparently on the hunt for scapegoats, thinks acrackdownon undocumented migrants should be a priority in the disaster response. With strong backing from Bayrou, anew law, restricting birthright citizenship and tightening routes to French nationality for children born in Mayotte, was adopted by the French national assembly last week.France derives clear benefits from its overseas territories. Failing to address their needs with the same commitment that it offers to people in its European territory is worse than a failure to honour the state’s responsibilities: it is a form of abandonment.Rokhaya Diallo is a Guardian Europe columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If youhave an electric vehicle, you might leave it charging at home or work after driving it. But there’s another step you could take. If you have a bidirectional charger, you can set it to sell power back to the grid when demand is high.Fewer than 10 people across Australia actually do this, because the technology – known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) – is very new. To date, it only works with a single car model (Nissan Leaf) and a single charger (Wallbox Quasar 1). We’ve estimated the number of users based on sales of this charger. The chargers are expensive and there’s a thicket of regulations to navigate.But that could soon change. Last year, the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, announcednew Australian standardsand communications protocols for bidirectional chargers in a bid to make it mainstream. Cheaper EVs and bidirectional chargers will make this more appealing.Tracey lost ‘priceless’ goods in a Melbourne storage unit break-in. Then the legal battle beganRead moreIf it takes off, V2G could become extremely useful to the power grid as a way to release power as required and stabilise the grid against fluctuations.This week, Australia’s renewable energy agencyreleased a V2G roadmap, which notes widespread uptake could “materially reduce electricity costs for consumers and accelerate national emissions reduction”.To understand why people are using the technology and the challenges to do so, we interviewed five early adopters from New South Wales and South Australia. Our findings arereleased today.Setting up V2G isn’t easyOur interviewees reported a long, complex journey to set up V2G. These early adopters had no playbook to follow, so the process was one of trial and error.Some relied on professional networks or social media groups to gather information. They spent significant time and energy finding electricians, installers and charger manufacturers to set up their systems. Strata approvals were required. They also had to negotiate with power retailers and distributors.Delays were common, especially when seeking approval from the energy distributor. Some interviewees reported delays of months to years.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsMost interviewees had experience in a technical field such as engineering or technology. Some reported a significant learning curve, while others using new software from their retailer reported a smoother “set and forget” process.So why do it? Our interviewees had several reasons, ranging from getting the most out of expensive assets (solar and the EV) to offsetting power bills entirely.Four out of five interviewees reported making a small profit of about $1,000 annually instead of a bill. Many wanted to be able to reduce dependence on the grid and reduce their environmental impact.As one told us:You originally think of it as a car you can also use to power your house. [But actually] it’s a house battery you can drive around.Maximising savingsTypically, our interviewees plugged their car in at home during the day to charge from their rooftop solar. In the evenings when power prices peaked, they used an app to sell power back to the grid. This maximised their cost savings for charging the car battery and their earnings from the grid.For instance, a V2G user was alerted by their energy retailer that power prices had spiked to over $20 per kilowatt hour – far above normal rates of 25-45 cents. They immediately set their car and home battery to sell power back to the grid. In two hours, they sold 28 kilowatt hours of power to the grid and made more than $560. As they told us: “I look forward to more such events.”Our interviewees often monitored energy prices, solar output and car battery levels to optimise their output. To avoid their EV battery getting too low, they set a lower limit – say 30% of charge – after which their car would stop exporting power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

But to date, there’s no consensus showing V2G shortens the battery life of EVs significantly. Onerecent studyshows it increases degradation by 0.3% a year. But another showed V2G might actuallyextend battery lifein some scenarios.‘Like finding gold’: plains-wanderers spotted in Melbourne’s west for first time in 30 years with help of AIRead moreLast year,we surveyedmore than 1,300 members of a motoring organisation about their view of V2G technology. We found battery warranty was a bigger concern than battery life. This is because most EV manufacturers other than Nissan don’t mention V2G in their battery warranties, leading drivers to believe they might void their warranty by using V2G.Awareness of V2G technology is growing. The survey also found almost 40% of respondents were very or somewhat familiar with V2G, a jump from the 17% who reported familiarity in 2022. Among EV owners, almost 90% reported knowledge of the concept.Moving beyond early adoptersFor V2G to go mainstream, the process must be much simpler, cheaper and easier to set up. To accelerate uptake, reliable, accessible information is essential.Expanding government incentive programs to include bidirectional chargers would cut the upfront cost and make it more accessible.Even within the EV supply chain, knowledge of V2G is limited. Car dealerships will need to know which models work with V2G.Electricians may need specific training to install and maintain these chargers.EVs are falling in price as manufacturers vie for market shareand cheaper options become available. V2G capabilities might help boost sales for competing car companies.As more motorists switch to EVs, interest in V2G will increase. While V2G can boost the appeal of EVs, there are others, such as Vehicle-to-Home (using your car to power your home during blackouts or to save money) and Vehicle-to-Load (using your EV to run power tools or appliances).Each of these can help consumers get more value from the vehicles parked in driveways and garages.Scott Dwyer, Jaime Comber and Kriti Nagrath are the research director, senior reearch consultant and research principal in energy futures at the University of Technology Sydney.

Witnessing the recent anti-Jewish hatred is shocking | Anthony LevinRead moreWe health professionals have an obligation to care, treat and protect our patients’ health and this is an obligation we take immensely seriously.This is a sacred responsibility that is universal, no matter which God we pray to or none.The shock and concern that many in our communities are expressing, particularly whether harm has actually been committed by these two nurses, shows the severe harm that this incident has caused to our public healthcare system.No one should ever feel that they will be mistreated by a health professional due to their religious or cultural backgrounds; unfortunately, we are now required to reinforce this view.I have the outmost faith in theNew South Waleshealth department and police to handle this matter with the diligence it requires.I understand that one of the nurses involvedhas apologised for his actions. While that is a positive gesture – and I hope it is sincere – the harm of his actions and those of his colleagues must be investigated, and the legal system allowed to take its course. The alleged perpetrators must not be work in healthcare for the foreseeable future.Their claims regarding past acts of hate and violence towards patients at the hospital are being investigated. I truly hope that nothing is found to have happened.Antisemitism has always existed and there has been a surge in reports but I am heartened by the swift public response calling these actions out and the work of the federal and NSW governments and authorities to tackle it.At the end of the day, our public healthcare system is essential to our communities and, in many ways, it is one of our proudest national institutions.These two nurses are outliers and do not represent the NSWHealthworkforce. Their comments have shaken me to my core, yet I am proud to be part of the public healthcare system and to care for people of all faiths and backgrounds.We are all Australian and this must always be remembered, and practised, in all instances.As a Jewish Australian I am proud to work in the public hospital system as have many of my relatives over many generations.

No survivor should have to wait this longAnonymousToo many survivors are forced to walk away from justice because the system makes it too hard – and that is unacceptableWed 12 Feb 2025 21.19 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Feb 2025 21.23 ESTShareWaiting is something survivors of sexual violence know too well. Waiting for justice. Waiting for accountability. Waiting to heal. But before any of that, there is another wait – one that should never happen. It is the wait for forensic medical exams, a crucial first step in seeking justice and closure.I know because I lived it.The night I was raped, I called my best friend. Through tears and shock, I told her what had happened. She told me to call 1800RESPECT because they were the experts. I did, and they were kind. They reassured me that I wasn’t alone and told me I needed medical attention because my assault had been violent. They also asked if I wanted to undergo a forensic medical exam. I said yes.I was told to go to a “large public hospital” for the exam. So I dressed – slowly, painfully, in a fog of disbelief – and made my way to one of the bigger hospitals. Surely, they would be able to do the exam there.The staff were gentle, understanding. They treated my injuries with care. But when it came time for the forensic exam, they told me they couldn’t do it. I had to go to another hospital further away. Apparently, this was the only place offering forensic examinations that night. So I left. I drove further away from my home, further into the night, still wearing the evidence of my assault on my skin.I was willing to wait because I felt I had no choice. But for too many survivors, that wait means the difference between justice and silenceAll I could think about was taking a shower. I wanted him off me. I felt his presence everywhere – on my clothes, in my hair, on my skin. But I couldn’t wash him away. Not yet. If I wanted a chance at justice, I had to wait.At this hospital, a specialist social worker met me. She was warm and calm, explaining what would happen next. A specialist forensic nurse had been called in. She was 30 minutes away. I could wait. Thirty minutes was manageable.Then the minutes stretched into hours. Another woman had arrived before me, needing the same forensic exam. There was only one forensic nurse. She had to see her first. The process is slow. There are questions, invasive swabs, photographs of injuries. This was not something that could be rushed.Five hours later, I was still waiting. In the grand scheme of things, my wait was an inconvenience – horrific, unnecessary, but it didn’t stop me from reporting or getting tested. The forensic nurse and social worker were incredibly compassionate. They were not the problem. The problem was the system that left me sitting in that room for hours, still unable to shower, because there was only one nurse available who could do this exam.I think about the women who don’t have a car, who live in more remote areas, who wait not hours but days for a forensic exam. How many give up? How many walk away because the system makes it too hard? How many perpetrators go free because crucial evidence is lost?Would you advise a loved one to a report sexual assault? It’s a question that exposes a failing justice system | Lucy ClarkRead moreBy the time my forensic exam was over, I had been in and out of waiting rooms for 10 hours. Ten hours before I could finally turn on a shower. It was cold, the water pressure was weak, but it was the best shower of my life.No survivor should have to wait that long. No survivor should be told their only option is one single hospital. If we are serious about justice for sexual violence survivors, we need better funding for forensic nurses, more hospitals equipped to provide these exams, and a system that understands that every minute a survivor waits, they are forced to live in the immediate aftermath of their assault.I was willing to wait because I felt I had no choice. But for too many survivors, that wait means the difference between justice and silence. And that is unacceptable – no survivor should have to endure these devastating delays. We must build a system that truly serves survivors when they need it most.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

The tiredness etched on their faces is not from late nights partying or long days networking. It looks more like the weight of the world on their shoulders.Anya Stasenko and Slava Leontyev are ceramics artists from the frontline Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. They have been married for decades and work together, making beautifully intricate painted porcelain beasts no bigger than your fist. When Russian troops invaded in 2022, rather than fleeing, the couple stayed in Kharkiv. Leontyev was a weapons instructor in the Ukrainian special forces, a weapons instructor who trained civilian volunteers. Then he picked up a camera and shot a documentary,Porcelain War. When the film premiered at Sundance in January 2024, the couple flew to the US, expecting to stay for a month.View image in fullscreenThe artists at work in their studio.Photograph: Picturehouse 2024Then, to everyone’s surprise, Porcelain War won the festival’s top documentary prize. The couple have spent the past year in the US raising awareness forUkraine. “We never planned to be here such a long time and we really need to get back as soon possible,” says Leontyev. They are based in Denver, but spend most of their time travelling with the film.Do they ever feel a sense of guilt about being away from Ukraine so long? Leontyev shakes his head. “I never felt guilty, but I really miss people.” He talks about his unease when he started making the documentary while still serving. “When I picked up my camera, someone had to pick up a rifle in my place, literally. I cannot explain. I felt … not guilty, but something was wrong.”View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian soldier with one of the artists’ creations.Photograph: ©Picturehouse 2024One day, Leontyev asked his unit commander for her honest opinion. “She said to me: ‘Your camera is a powerful weapon. More impactful than a rifle.’ It was only possible to make this movie because my unit completely supported us.” So far, the unit has had no fatalities. “It is a miracle,” he says.We are talking without an interpreter. Last January, Stasenko and Leontyev arrived in the US unable to speak English. In a year, they have gone from zero to conversational. Leontyev is apologetic. “Our English is not so perfect,” he grins. “The grammar is absent!”At this point, a little scrap of fur pokes its head up from his wife’s lap. It’s Frodo, the couple’s terrier, another star of the film. Frodo is barking at an aeroplane. “He thinks every aeroplane is a military aeroplane. He chases them away,” says Leontyev, looking at his wife. They smile at each other.Watch a trailer for the film.Stasenko and Leontyev have known each other since childhood. There is a photograph in Porcelain War of Stasenko pushing her future husband down the street in an old-fashioned pram (she is a few years older than him). They got together at art school in the 1980s in what was still Soviet Ukraine. In 1991, they were students when the Soviet Union collapsed. “It was interesting – and a hungry time,” says Leontyev.“It’s normal for students to be hungry!” his wife points out. She wonders whether living through that moment prepared them for the war. “It was a beautiful time. It did not look like the war. But our generation, we have this experience of broken rules all around. We understand that all around may fly away in a moment.”Oscars nominations 2025: the full listRead moreThey eventually settled in Crimea, close to their friend Andrey Stefanov, a painter who is the cinematographer on Porcelain War. Then, in 2014, Russia invaded Crimea and they returned to Kharkiv. At this point, Leontyev started military training. “Weknew,” he says. “Since the annexation of Crimea, weknewwhat kind of war would come to us.”The couple fill their film with the beauty of Ukraine’s landscape. We also watch Stasenko paint – an act of resistance in the face of an aggressor aiming to obliterate a nation’s identity. In his voiceover, Leontyev compares porcelain to Ukraine: “Easy to break, impossible to destroy.”Porcelain War review – beautifully rendered portrait of Ukraine’s artist-warriorsRead morePorcelain War takes us tothe Bakhmut frontlinein footage shot by the civilian soldiers in Leontyev’s unit, using bodycams and drones shipped from the US with medical supplies by a Ukrainian hairdresser in New Jersey. The drones track bombs falling on Russian targets. They are operated by people who once had regular jobs, but now look death in the face every day. There is an IT analyst, a furniture salesman, a dairy farmer. Watching it, you can’t help but wonder: could I do that? Do I have what it takes?Leontyev says the message is about resistance – ordinary people defending democracy. It shows the best of Ukrainians, he says. “In dark times, kind people shine. All these people joined as volunteers. They are not only defending their families; they came because they felt responsibility in the face of history. This battle is between totalitarianism and democracy. It’s not the frontline between Ukraine and Russia. It’s the frontline of the whole world.”Porcelain War has been nominated for best documentary at the Oscars; the couple’s stay in the US has been prolonged once again. A win would make the world their audience, up there on stage to accept the award, wouldn’t it? They nod. But Leontyev is modest about the achievement. “I never thought we’d be nominated. I don’t feel like it’s mine. Behind the film is the bravery of every Ukrainian soldier and the resilience of every Ukrainian civilian. It’s the nomination of every Ukrainian.”Explore more on these topicsOscarsUkraineDocumentary filmsAwards and prizesSundance film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

X-Ray Eyes (2024)The most recentLCD Soundsystemsingle sounded remarkably like a callback to their earliest releases: a minimal backing of rhythm track and synth – playing a riff that recalls their debut single, Losing My Edge – plus a spoken-word vocal that’s alternately creepily stalker-ish and drily funny.19. Movement (2005)The Fall were clearly a major influence on LCD, but never more so than on James Murphy’s scathing, Mark-E-Smith-esque assault on what an excitable 00s music press called the “New Rock Revolution”, complete with a lyrical quote from Telephone Thing (“I’m tapped!”). Suicide-style electronics and raging guitar complete the picture.18. Get Innocuous! (2007)As Murphy has often pointed out, he never intended to have a career as an artist, just as a producer. Get Innocuous! wrestles with the reality of unexpected success to a mesmerising accompaniment, with the vocalist Nancy Whang in the role of cheerleader: “You can normalise – don’t it make you feel alive?”17. Call the Police (2017)Seven minutes of relentless, hypnotic new-wave-inspired pounding, Robert-Fripp-ish guitar – and an inexplicably satisfying tick-tocking vintage drum machine sound – buoys a horrified response to the rise of Donald Trump. The lyrics featuring an all-too-familiar cast of frightened old guys, “trigger kids and fakers and some questionable views”.16. You Wanted a Hit (2010)View image in fullscreenMesmerising … Nancy Whang and LCD Soundsystem.Photograph: Leandro Justen/BFA/ShutterstockAmong the reasons LCD broke up was record company pressure to repeat their past successes, as addressed by You Wanted a Hit: “Leave us on our own … we won’t be your babies any more.” Fittingly, the sound would be commercial were it not disrupted by slashing guitar and jarringly electronic effects; the Soulwax remix, meanwhile, streamlines it perfectly for the dancefloor.15. Never as Tired as When I’m Waking Up (2005)A lot of LCD’s eponymous debut album is concerned with the night before, but this feels very much like the morning (or afternoon) after. It suddenly lurches into life, tender but fuzzy-headed, with a melody that carries a faint hint of the Beatles circa the White Album. The result is beautiful: an underrated gem.14. How Do You Sleep? (2017)No reference point in LCD’s music is ever accidental – Murphy is an unabashed music nerd – including pilfering the title of John Lennon’s notorious attack on Paul McCartney. Amid booming drums, swirling synths and explosions of raw analogue bleeping, Murphy sounds genuinely anguished at the collapse of the friendship at the heart of DFA Records.13. Yeah (Crass Version) (2004)By Murphy’s account, Yeah had a difficult, lengthy gestation. His frustration seeped into the lyrics (“I’m getting tired of listening, knowing that this shit’s gotta run”), but the end result was worth it: seething, chaotic punk-funk that gradually shifts its sound from disco to squealing acid house, as if providing a potted history of dance music.12. Oh Baby (2017)If you were going to announce you were back, six years after a grand farewell gig at Madison Square Garden, the opening track of American Dream was a hugely appealing way to do it: Suicide’s Dream Baby Dream recast as dubby, Balearic pop, the blissed-out mood at odds with Murphy’s pleading vocal.View image in fullscreenUnabashed music nerd … James Murphy.Photograph: Xavi Torrent/WireImage11. All I Want (2010)You could easily dismiss All I Want as record-collection rock: it’s equal parts David Bowie’s Heroes and Brian Eno’s Here Come the Warm Jets. But if bemoaning clear reference points is your thing, LCD probably aren’t the band for you. And besides: who cares when the results are exceptional?10. Dance Yrself Clean (2010)It’s all about the moment, three minutes in, when what initially appears to be a subdued, sparse electronic lament explodes. The whole thing gets louder, as if you have suddenly cranked the volume control, an idea so simple and thrilling you wonder why more people don’t do it.9. Home (2010)The final track on what was supposed to be LCD’s final album is a lovely thing, with warm electronic arpeggios and electric piano, clip-clopping percussion and a lyric that seems to plot their progress from unlikely solo project to the camaraderie of a band: “You’re surrounded, it won’t get any better, and so – goodnight.”8. New York, I Love You But You’re Bringing Me Down (2007)The anti Empire State of Mind. A song that sounds, unexpectedly, like a lost 40s standard, it laments the passing of the city’s scuzzier and more exciting days – “you’re safer and you’re wasting my time” – yet sounds begrudgingly enthralled despite the gentrification: “You’re still the one pool where I’d happily drown.”7. Tonite (2017)Murphy’s lyrics can occasionally approach music journalism, as on this funny, incisive examination of 21st-century pop’s penchant for carpe diem messaging. Is it actually expressing a fear of ageing, death or the future? Its cleverness wouldn’t matter without a killer tune, which Tonite has, along with a filthy, squelchy synth riff.6. Someone Great (2007)This is LCD’s take on the cocktail of euphoria and melancholy at the heart of a lot of great disco and house music. The rhythm is propulsive, the glockenspiel-assisted melody is bright, but the mood is suffused with sighing sadness and the lyrics contemplate grief. A punch is duly packed.5. North American Scum (2007)A marvellously conflicted examination of the US (less fun than Berlin, apparently) and foreign perceptions of its inhabitants (“I know you wouldn’t touch us with a 10ft pole”), with a hint of Talking Heads in its lyrical and musical DNA. Its brand of funk is agitated, its bassline is a monster.View image in fullscreenMurphy and Pat Mahoney performing at Glastonbury festival in 2024.Photograph: Joe Maher/Getty Images4. I Can Change (2010)A homage to early 80s synth pop – you would be forgiven for thinking you were listening to Yazoo when the intro kicks in – but rather than focus on that sound’s neon hues, I Can Change digs deep into its yearning, lovelorn quality. For all the promise in the title, you suspect the troubled relationship isn’t going to work out.3. Losing My Edge (2002)Allegedly inspired by a meeting with a young Pharrell Williams and made on a toy synthesiser attached to an ancient beatbox, LCD’s fantastic debut single was satire of and a love letter to hip record-collector snobbery, packed with snarky wit and riven with an affecting insecurity. It’s also funky as hell.2. Daft Punk Is Playing at My House (2005)A fantasy of the French house duo performing at a house party like a local punk band, you could read this track as an analogy for Murphy’s MDMA-fuelled transformation from uptight punk to dance fanatic. Either way, it’s punchy, writhing and as improbably exciting as the scenario it describes.1. All My Friends (2007)When LCD Soundsystem appeared with Losing My Edge – smart, sarky, thoroughly meta – the last thing you would have expected them to make was a moving paean to lasting friendship and time passing. But that’s what All My Friends is. It might have been inspired by the loneliness of touring, but anyone can see themselves reflected in its desire to reconnect and peel back the years. The message is: don’t worry about tomorrow; come and party tonight. As the music shifts slowly from melancholy to euphoria – underpinned by a piano line that owes something to the Velvet Underground’s I’m Waiting for the Man – it’s a very tough invitation to refuse.Explore more on these topicsRankedLCD SoundsystemPop and rockDance musicElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Who were you most star-struck by?McScootikinsHarrison Ford! I was star-struck when Harrison Ford came to visit because I’d made Indy [Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]. Spielberg played a big joke on him. There was a biography out of him that he really hated, so Steven went out and bought about 300 copies, so that when Harrison came to visit and walked on to set, the security guard, the gaffers, the camera equipment people,everybodywas reading that biography.I remember when we were told that Michael Jackson was going to visit. The cast and crew were so excited. We didn’t know what time he was arriving, so we were constantly looking over our shoulder. Sure enough, when he walked on to the set, everybody just stopped what they were doing – even the guy making the coffee. He was very shy. I think we made him nervous because there were so many people. Then we took those photos that you see on the internet. We were so giddy that he was there. He gave us tickets to watch him perform in Los Angeles, and gave us all a jacket, which some of us still have. Somehow I lost mine, which I’m very mad at myself for.How do you believe your childhood inHo Chi Minh City, and your subsequent flight from Vietnam, affected your career in film?FedUpWithEverything2View image in fullscreenGoonies never say die! … Quan, centre, in The Goonies.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarFirst, it gave me a global perspective. Second, it gave me this huge sense of gratitude; this appreciation that I get to do what I love. I feel so lucky to be an actor and to be able to make movies that entertain people all over the world. My first movie was Temple of Doom, which was so beloved. I followed that with The Goonies – again another iconic movie. I feel so lucky to be a part of those and to have so many fans come up to me on the street and say how growing up watching those movies had a huge impact on their life.You were arguably typecast in the early stages of your career, as wereother actors of Asian heritage. Will Hollywood ever properly embrace colour-blind casting?MoreorLesPaulWhen I started my career, it was a very different time. My latest movie, Love Hurts, is a big-budget movie with an Asian lead. That alone is a testament to how much everything has changed and to Hollywood’s willingness to tell diverse stories. I’m very optimistic. When I read for Love Hurts, there was no description for my character. Open casting is something I applaud Hollywood for. Ouroboros in Loki was another incredible character I played that had no specific ethnicity, but Marvel thought I’d be good for it. So things are looking really good.What goes through your mind when you stand up to receive an Oscar?richpelleyView image in fullscreen‘It was the one of the greatest feelings I’ve ever had in my life’ … Quan with his Oscar for best supporting actor in Everything Everywhere All at Once.Photograph: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagicWhen my name was read out, I was so overwhelmed with emotion, my mind was a blur. I couldn’t believe it was happening. I had a dream for 40 years and when I was handed that Oscar, that dream became a reality. It was the one of the greatest feelings I’ve ever had in my life and something I wish everyone would get to experience. Not necessarily win an Oscar, but whatever your Oscar moment is, I wish everybody could feel that. It was incredible.What does your wife make of your return to the spotlight?EveningEdition25For years, even when I didn’t believe in myself, she said: “Trust me.” So now I think she would like to say: “I told you!” She really believed in me, so I’m glad I didn’t disappoint her. The best part is seeing how happy she is for me. She has really made this entire journey even more special.Youalways looks so dapper on the red carpet. What’s your secret?hittheroadjackI have a lot of help. My wife has great taste, as does my stylist, Chloe. When I was nominated for an Oscar, Giorgio Armani reached out and said: ‘We would love to make you a tux.’ I was like: ‘What?’ I remember going into the Armani store, getting measured, and a month later, going back to try it on. I realised: this is what a made-to-order tux looks like. I love it. I wish I could take credit, but really the credit belongs to the people who help me look good.View image in fullscreenTestament to how much everything has changed’ … Quan as Marvin Gable in Love Hurts.Photograph: Allen Fraser/Universal PicturesDid you really promise your mum that you wouldn’t swear when filming The Goonies?TopTrampFuck, yeah! It’s true. But not any more! I did say: “S-H-I-T,” but you’ve got to give me some credit. At least I can spell!In retrospect, should you have contained your excitement a bitwhen you introduced Joe Biden [at an event]?MrSOBaldrickAbsolutely not! He was the president of the United States. I thought I was going to be cool and say the line: “Ladies and Gentlemen, here is the president of the United States.” That is one sentence that I never thought I would get to say. But by the time it got to it, I was jumping up and down with excitement. I don’t think I would’ve done it any other way.Love Hurts review – Everything Everywhere all over againRead moreWhat type of movies would you like to make more of?RedAmazonaOh my gosh. There’s a long list of movies I want to make and film-makers I want to work with. I grew up in the 80s watching big commercial movies such as the Back to the Future trilogy and Jaws, all those incredible, fun, really cool movies that had an impact on people’s lives. I would love to be a part of more of those movies. I’d love to play a bad guy. I got a little taste of that when playing Marvin Gable [in Love Hurts]. It’s a lot of fun to be a bad guy. It takes me out of my comfort zone. How often do I get asked about Goonies 2? That is the question I’ve been asked the most over the last four decades – which is incredible. Any other of the Goonies – Sean, Josh or Jeff – will tell you the same thing, which is incredible. Aren’t I a bit old to be a Goonie? No!

At his peak Stone was a supernova, burning bright and fast in the late 60s and early 70s with Sly and the Family Stone hits that shone with glorious optimism and musical virtuosity.Yet Stone’s personal troubles derailed his career as he battled drug addiction, leading to Family feuds, squandered opportunities and decades of obscurity.‘I kicked ass’: funk pioneer Sly Stone on taking Woodstock by storm, partying with George Clinton and getting cleanRead moreSly’s story and what it says about expectations placed on Black artists is the subject of Sly Lives! (AKA The Burden of Black Genius), a vibrant and probing new documentary from the director Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson and the producer Joseph Patel. The release follows Summer of Soul, the pair’s mesmerizing film about 1969’s Harlem Cultural Festival, which won the best documentary Oscar in 2022. “Our premise is about Sly being the first post-civil rights Black star who has a white audience and a Black audience, and what that specific American burden is on Black artists,” says Patel.The impact of the Texas-born artist on popular music is hard to overstate. In an imperial run of six albums between 1968 and 1974, Sly and the Family Stone, as the critic Steven Hyden wrote in theNew York Times, “anticipated virtually every major trend in rhythm and blues of the next decade”. Unusually for a late-60s America still reeling from Jim Crow, Stone’s Family included members of multiple races and genders. Their sound was a heady and often joyous merging of funk, rock and psychedelic soul. The band crafted a swinging, sunny vision of togetherness (Everyday People, Dance to the Music), rousing anthems for equality (Stand!) as well as an agitated exploration of injustice in 1971’s classic There’s a Riot Goin’ On. With its American flag as artwork, the album was both a pointed answer to Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On? as well as a display of Stone’s own innovation: it was the first major label record to use a drum machine.As well as writing, producing, arranging and playing nearly a dozen instruments on Sly and the Family Stone albums, Stone produced the Great Society’s Somebody to Love, later memorably covered by Jefferson Airplane. (“He played every instrument and I just stood there with my jaw on the ground,” marvels the vocalist Grace Slick in the film.) “He’s got some magical way of weaving things together,” says Jimmy Jam. As half of the iconic production duo Jam & Lewis, he sampled a six-second snatch of Stone’s 1969 single Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) for the sledgehammering bassline of Janet Jackson’s 1989 Rhythm Nation. “Sly created musical unity for my generation,” says Lewis. “To be able to sample that and create that for the next generation of listeners is an amazing thing.”While other documentaries such as Michael Rubenstone’s 2017 film On the Sly have explored Stone’s story, Patel notes that “they’re all done by white guys of a certain age, and they all don’t really focus on his Blackness. What makes this movie different is it’s the first look at Sly and his Blackness from a Black perspective.“It’s for hip-hop kids too,” he continues. Stone’s music has been sampled by Dr Dre, LL Cool J and Mobb Deep (as well as others from Beck to Brandy); Questlove and Patel sought to imbue their documentary with the urgency of the culture. In contrast to recent musical documentaries that predictably check off biographical beats, Sly Lives! sharply splices together footage from different decades and milieus, embodying the restless energy of hip-hop’s rebels without a pause. “We wanted it to feel like a Public Enemy album,” says Patel.As well as artists including the disco god Nile Rodgers, the funk queen Chaka Khan and George Clinton of Parliament-Funkadelic, a raft of other music heavyweights act as what Patel calls “proxies for Sly”: Black artists who have taken idiosyncratic routes through fame. There’s Andre 3000 who gave up rap to play flute, the enigmatic hip-hop producer Q-Tip and D’Angelo, the mercurial genius who was hailed as the next Marvin Gaye at 23 and then mainly receded from public life. Questlove had a theory going into the project that, as Patel recalls, “when Black artists have success, they sometimes don’t feel like they’ve earned it, or there’s a lot of guilt and they self-sabotage”. Not everyone was ready to tackle these weighty issues on camera. “There’s a couple of other artists that canceled last-minute because they were freaked out by the subject matter,” says Patel. “I was really angry, but it proved our point.” (Stone himself, now 81, was unavailable to participate due to ill health.)Sly Lives! does justice to its subject by celebrating Stone’s rarely paralleled talents as well as refusing to look away from his failings. (His daughter’s recollection of snorting chalk powder with Monopoly money to be like her dad is particularly bracing to watch.) With empathy and care, the film examines the bleak circumstances that might drive a Black artist who had been embraced by the white mainstream to drugs. In a frank interview, Chaka Khan, who has openly discussed her own struggles with addiction, offers a reasoning. “To self-medicate and self-soothe, and to try and attain a false sense of everything’s OK when it’s not.”“[We] want people to realize how much Sly has given us,” says Patel. “And secondly, we want people to realize their own culpability in not showing these artists – Black artists specifically – grace, and letting them be human.”View image in fullscreenSly Stone.Photograph: Stephen PaleyThat’s a level of respect not always felt in watching a newly uncovered Stone interview conducted by Maria Shriver, who peppers Stone with accusations about his downfall (Stone grips his armrest as if on a rollercoaster). And footage of an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show from 1970, the year that Life called Cavett “the brightest face on screen”, paints a less rosy picture of the TV host. “Could I dress like this and play with your group?” Cavett asks snidely, gesturing to his conservative suit. Stone, clad in all his finery, refuses to take the bait. He simply stares at the man serenely, like the funkiest pupil at a Buddhist monastery.“I know how it feels to expect to get a fair shake,” Stonesangover heraldic brass and gospel harmonies in 1967’s Underdog. “But they won’t let you forget / That you’re the underdog and you’ve got to be twice as good.” Even as he spelled out the inequalities faced by Black artists of the time, many seemed to dislike that Stone dared to take pride in his hard-won achievements. At one point in the documentary, Questlove asks D’Angelo: “Why are we such workaholics?” The singer responds with a laugh. “Man, you know why.”“There’s no Prince and the Revolution without Sly and the Family Stone,” says George Clinton. Last year, Beyoncéused Stone’s musicin a promotional video for Cowboy Carter. A few days before the release of Sly Lives! some of the crew gathered at a Super Bowl party. Midway through his half-time show, Kendrick Lamar recreated the American flag with a formation of dancers dressed in red, white and blue. Patel and Questlove shot each other a look. “That image has a different meaning today than it did in 1971,” Patel says, referencing the indelible cover of There’s a Riot Goin’ On. “But it was exactly it” – further proof that Sly lives.Sly Lives!

Now, Miki Berenyi is back with new music as Miki Berenyi Trio, and will be answering your questions on her life and career.‘I could see the trap in the ladette thing’: Lush’s Miki Berenyi on childhood abuse, hating Britpop, and her relief at dodging fameRead moreIn her memoir, Berenyi charted her path through a troubled childhood and into the late-80s UK music scene, where Lush initially distinguished themselves from their moodier shoegaze peers with bright, chiming guitars and Berenyi’s wistfully beautiful vocal lines. As Britpop became a pop cultural phenomenon, the band upped the tempo, sharpened their focus, and wrote songs which still stand out: Single Girl and Ladykillers, both Top 30 hits, eye-rollingly lamented toxic male suitors, while Ciao! was an evocative duet with Jarvis Cocker.Fingers Crossed: How Music Saved Me from Success by Miki Berenyi review – a shoegaze star’s painful pastRead moreThe band ended in tragedy after the suicide of their drummer Chris Acland, and Berenyi left music behind for a time, working as a subeditor for a magazine publisher. Lush briefly reformed in 2016, and in 2022, Berenyi published her memoir Fingers Crossed: How Music Saved Me from Success,described by the Observer’s Kitty Empireas “a salutary corrective to a much mythologised musical era; it’s often extremely funny. But it’s also a nuanced portrait of personal survival.”Berenyi has also fronted Piroshka, a band featuring members of Elastica, Modern English and Moose, the latter namely her partner Kevin McKillop. The couple have since formed the Miki Berenyi Trio alongside guitarist Oliver Cherer, and are gearing up to release their debut album Tripla on 4 April.Ahead of its release, Berenyi will answer your questions – post them in the comments below before Monday 17 February.

The archive revealed that Vézelay, the British abstract painter who changed her name from Marjorie Watson-Williams shortly after moving to Paris in 1926, was on “chère amie” terms with Joan Miró, Alexander Calder and the Kandinskys. Ernest Hemingway addresses her as “Dear Madame Vézelay”,Alberto Giacomettisimply as “Paule”. Henri Matisse regretfully declines her invitation to take part in a group show in London. An altogether brighter László Moholy-Nagy writes that he’s been to see her work: “I congratulate you,” he beams. “I visited your exhibition. I was delighted.”Now the exuberant personality and the prodigiously creative output that cemented Vézelay as a 20th-century force to be reckoned with are being showcased at a new exhibition, Paule Vézelay: Living Lines, currently on view at the Royal West of England Academy (RWA) in Bristol.Vézelay was born in the Clifton area of the city in 1892. Her mother was related to the founder of the Quakers and her father was a prominent ear, nose and throat specialist, who, curator Simon Grant tells me, “illustrated his own book. And I think [his daughter] helped him.” Vézelay was sporty, beautiful and entirely undaunted. She left London’s Slade School of FineArtjust a few classes in when she was treated like a beginner, then left the UK for France when a suitor got too clingy. And she changed her name while she was living in Paris because she wanted to be international and English art bored her.“Paris in the 1920s was the centre of ideas and liberation,” says Grant. “Vézelay had this vision of herself within that environment, and she made it on her own, without any help. She kept pushing the boundaries of her work. That takes a staggering amount of self-discipline and self-belief. And she talks about it: about the joy of being an artist.”The RWA show strings together works from every decade of this long artistic life. Early figuration in etching and watercolour is followed by loping, organic forays into abstraction. Dance, movement and experimentation are never far removed. In 1936, she crisscrosses lengths of fishing wire between the edges of a frame for her first Lines in Space piece, and when these are shown at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher in Paris, everyone who is anyone comes to the opening: Mondrian, Miro, and Kandinsky, who starts recommending her for various exhibitions around Europe. “She must have thought: ‘Finally, I’ve made it, big time!’” says Grant, “and then the war broke out a few months later. She had to return to the UK, which must have been very frustrating because she’d been away for 20 years.”The slim catalogue to a 1983 Tate retrospective notes that in surviving the first world war, Vézelay, then a student at the London School of Art, was more fortunate than her male peers, who had to sign up and were almost all killed. When the military authorities refused her permission to draw bomb damage in Bristol during the second world war, she went to get a permit from the man in charge of the War Artists’ Advisory Committee, Kenneth Clark himself. She also set up Bristol’s women’s defence corps, “because,” she raged, “what are women going to do in the war? What’s our contribution going to be?”In the months before she died, she was interviewed by Germaine Greer for a Women of Our Century documentary. “Vézelay’s work is her life,” Greer said, “and she keeps it about her as a living oyster keeps its pearl.”Creative output: four works by Paule VézelayView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Martin Edwards/University of Bristol Theatre CollectionBristol Hippodrome, 1918-19Vézelay started out wanting to be a lighting designer and, in an early letter, writes to the head of the Bristol theatre to ask for a job. “She carries on being fascinated by theatre and the energy in the crowds,” says Grant. “That fascination with light and shadow goes right through her work to the very end.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The Estate of Paule Vézelay/TateThe Bathers, 1923Before she settled in Paris, Vézelay spent time in the south of France with the British dancer Margaret Morris and her troupe. “She met Picasso on a beach, because he was friends with Morris’s husband, the Scottish painter John Duncan Fergusson.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Instead, she moved to Barnes and started planning a garden, “which was more than a garden,” says Grant. “It was one of her great works.” As in her painting, she was working with colour and line and space.Paule Vézelay: Living Lines is at Royal West of England Academy, Bristol, to 27 AprilExplore more on these topicsArt and designExhibitionsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As an adventurer and fan of ethically produced dairy products, you are determined to attend the fabled event, arriving at the dock on a small boat with only a few gold coins and a dream. This is the backdrop to the worst role-playing adventure I have ever experienced – and, entirely coincidentally, the only one I have ever designed.The game creation package RPG Maker has been around since 1992, the first version launching on the Japanese PC-98 computer. Since then, development has been passed from veteran software publisher ASCII to Enterbrain and then Chiyoda-based Gotcha GotchaGames, and dozens of instalments have appeared. Although it has become increasingly complex over the years, RPG Maker remains a remarkably intuitive way to make adventure games with no development experience at all.The package comes with thousands of pre-made maps, buildings, characters and items, which creators can use and modify; but you can also start from scratch, crafting your own assets to make unique games. Your projects can be shared with the RPG Maker community and several acclaimed indie games have been built with the program, including To The Moon, Corpse Party and Omori. I can tell you that Artisan Cheese Quest will not be joining them.View image in fullscreenAn exclusive screenshot of Artisan Cheese Quest on RPG Maker.Photograph: NIS AmericaTo be fair, the game only took me and my 19-year-old son Zac about two hours to make, using thePlayStation 5version of RPG Maker (launching on 21 February). At first we chose the Swamp location from the huge variety of pre-made maps, which mostly offer traditional fantasy and sci-fi options. Then we selected a character – a cute little anime-style warrior. From here you start the actual process of making a game that offers challenging things to do. Everything that takes place in the world is called an Event, and to create one you need to construct a set of conditions using a very simple visual programming language.If you’ve ever tried Scratch, the popular coding tool used in schools throughout the world, you’ll be right at home. Say you want to hide a magic key in a treasure chest: you place the chest on the map, then use the menu system to place a key inside it. Add a locked door then place a condition on that door: if the player has the key, the door opens, if they don’t, they get a fail message.With the same system, you can add branching dialogue with characters, plan enemy patrol paths and eventually craft a combat system – everything is controlled via a series of if/then commands. During lockdown, Zac and I used Scratch to make a very simple maze game where you guided a mouse towards a block of cheese, so we decided to stick with our established game design expertise here. We built a tavern, attached the tavern interior to a building on the main landscape map, added characters to provide hints and hid an artisan cheese festival pass in a treasure chest on a small island. We didn’t use any original assets but we did write all the dialogue and the story – i.e. find the pass, open the tavern door, eat cheese. Please keep us in mind for this year’s Bafta games award for best narrative.View image in fullscreenRPG Maker on PlayStation 5.Photograph: NIS AmericaMost importantly, the process was enormous fun. You’re able to select background music and sound effects, and going for wildly inappropriate options had us crying with laughter: we put very dramatic combat music in the most innocuous areas; our treasure chest screamed when you opened it; villagers randomly barked and growled. And however basic the final result is, you still get that thrill at having made something that functions and looks a lot like an actual game. As you get used to the system, your ambitions grow: we later added a zombie who wanders around the map complaining about his lactose intolerance.I’m not going to lie – although the system is intuitive, it getsextremelydemanding when you start thinking about creating multi-stage boss encounters or designing a levelling up system for your character. If you’re not used to working with lengthy routines and sub-routines and game mechanics that all mess with each other, you’ve a long road ahead. True, any time we weren’t sure how to make something work, the game’s online community helped: there are hundreds of videos on YouTube and lots of helpful people on Reddit. But I feel we’re some way from making anything even slightly resembling a commercial game.Perhaps at some point in the future, Artisan Cheese Quest will be one of the finest fromage-based fantasy role-playing adventures available onPlayStation5. For now, we’re just going to keep adding stupid sound effects until it stops being funny. Honestly, don’t hold your breath.Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5PlayStationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Shortly after the announcement, Sabsabi admitted to being shocked at being chosen, telling the Guardian: “I felt that, in this time and in this space, this wouldn’t happen because of who I am.”Khaled Sabsabi never thought he’d be Australia’s pick for the Venice Biennale - podcastRead moreThe selection wasnot without its critics, however, amid a febrile political climate in which Anthony Albanese’s Labor government has been condemned by the opposition for what some have deemed an insufficient response toa spate of antisemitic attacksin recent months.It appears that Australia’s federal arts body Creative Australia, who picked Sabsabi alongside curator Michael Dagostino, have responded to political pressure to drop the artist. In a statement they said: “The board of Creative Australia has made the unanimous decision not to proceed with the artistic team chosen for theVenice Biennale2026. Creative Australia is an advocate for freedom of artistic expression and is not an adjudicator on the interpretation of art. However, the board believes a prolonged and divisive debate about the 2026 selection outcome poses an unacceptable risk to public support for Australia’s artistic community and could undermine our goal of bringing Australians together through art and creativity.”The decision comes after the issue made its way to the Australian Senate. During question time, Liberal senator Claire Chandler raised Sabsabi’s selection, saying: “With such appalling antisemitism in our country, why is the Albanese government allowing the person who highlights a terrorist leader in his artwork to represent Australia on the international stage?”Yet some critics have taken a more nuanced view of Sabsabi’s artworks. Describing You, the video installation using fractured images of Nasrallah, theMuseum Of Contemporary Art’s websitestates: “Sabsabi’s use of the multiplying image is purposefully ambiguous. It plays on western fears of cultural difference … and suggests the all-pervasiveness of the public news media, and its ability to deify or vilify through the intensive repetition of imagery on our television screens.” The title Thank You Very Much also plays with ambiguity: the work includes a clip of George W Bush, US president during the attacks, saying the phrase during a press conference.Sabsabi is no stranger to provocation and political statements. He has previously made work critical of Islamic State, and in 2009 embossed the letters Fuck Off We’re Full on a gallery wall. In 2022, he was one of 20 artists to withdraw from the Sydney festival over its sponsorship deal with the Israaeli embassy, saying that his works are “tied by blood to Palestine, the Palestinian cause and their right to self-determination and their right to return to their lands”.Speaking from his garage studio in Sydney, Sabsabi last week told the Guardian how thrilled he had been to be selected. “It’s an honour because the majority of my work and my passion and commitment over the years has been about ideas of representation, ideas of identity and looking at breaking stereotypes, especially within the Australian context of Muslims and Arabs,” he said.His work, which encompasses painting, moving image and scent art, draws from Sufism, the refugee crisis and Arab identity. But it is especially entwined with Sabsabi’s experience of having to flee Tripoli as a child: “Having the trauma of the civil war … this affects who I am and what I make.” he said.Creative Australia will now embark on selecting another artist to represent the country. Last year, Bigambul-Kamilaroi artist Archie Moorewon the Golden Lion at the biennalefor his exhibitionkith and kin– becoming the first Australian to win the prize.Explore more on these topicsVenice BiennalenewsShareReuse this content"

Rather than write a memoir of those times I decided to share my experiences in a different way, through the lens of leadership which I hope will provide lessons for anyone who wants to discover their own authentic leadership style.”Despite persistent criticismof Southgate’s management, during his tenure he led the England team to the most sustained period of success in its history. In 2018, the team reached the World Cup semi finals, and in 2020 and 2024 they reached the Euros finals.In Dear England, Southgate will reflect on moments that shaped his leadership style, “principles that defined his decisions, and the resilience that enabled him to perform under the most intense public scrutiny”, according to the book’s publisher Century, an imprint of Penguin Random House. The book “transcends football”, with leadership lessons “that can apply to any individual, team or organisation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But surprisingly it has never produced its own version of Hamlet. “It’s unbelievable, isn’t it?” says Justin Audibert, who in 2023 succeeded Daniel Evansas the theatre’s artistic director. “We’ve done three Antony and Cleopatras!”Audibert is now preparing to direct Hamlet himself, with the tragic prince played by Giles Terera, who won an Olivier award when hestarred as Aaron Burrin the London premiere of Hamilton. The play will open in September in Chichester’s smaller Minerva theatre. “We are imagining that Old Hamlet [the prince’s father] has let the kingdom decline,” says Audibert, whose production will explore the “leadership vacuum” that comes from an older generation “clinging on to power for a really long time”. Hamlet’s father “has definitely got some Biden vibes” says Audibert, and the director has also been reflecting on the succession of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad from his father, Hafez. Terera, whostarred as Othelloat the National Theatre in 2022, will play a Hamlet who is similar in age to his stepfather, Claudius.View image in fullscreenJustin Audibert joined Chichester Festival theatre in 2023.Photograph: Peter FludeThe Minerva, which seats around 300 people, could bring you closer to Hamlet’s inner turmoil, Audibert suggests, recalling his experience of watching Rupert Goold’s2007 Macbethwith Patrick Stewart. “I’m fascinated by how fast Shakespeare’s characters think,” he says. One question he asks when staging the plays is: “How do you propel it forward – all the time?”Audibert arrived at Chichester after running London’s Unicorn theatre for children, so he has swapped one of the country’s youngest audiences for what is probably one of the oldest. A huge number of visitors to the Unicorn are naturally completely new to the venue, while Chichester is used to welcoming back theatregoers who have built “a real commitment and passion for the institution”. He relishes how both groups “tell you exactly what they think”, and adds, “Chichester is a very civic-minded place. The theatre was founded through a movement within the community who fundraised for it.”View image in fullscreenTom Rosenthal will star in The Government InspectorAudibert’s first season at Chichester included a wildly successful version ofOliver!that has transferred to the West End. His second season, announced on Thursday, will include another big musical, Top Hat, which will be directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall. A musical adaptation of Rachel Joyce’s novel The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, with music and lyrics by singer-songwriter Passenger, will star Mark Addy and Jenna Russell. Game of Thrones’s Natalie Dormer will play Anna Karenina;Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti’s new play Choir will “celebrate music and togetherness”; and a new version of Gogol’s The Government Inspector (with “big belly laughs”) will star Tom Rosenthal, directed by Gregory Doran.There are also adaptations of William Golding’s Lord of the Flies and Matt Haig’s A Boy Called Christmas, the latter performed by theChichester Festival Youth Theatreto mark its 40th anniversary. “We’ll have 70 children on stage and 30 children backstage running that show,” Audibert says.A new play by Jamie Bogyo called Safe Space will be directed in the Minerva by Roy Alexander Weise. The drama is billed as a bracing account of campus politics at a US university whose students are “confronting the injustices of the past … starting with the fact that the college is named after a notorious defender of slavery”. Audibert says: “On the one hand it’s about these big culture-wars ideas like legacy, restitution and justice … and on another level, it’s about loads of 20-year-olds who as well as dealing with important social political issues are also working out who they are, what they stand for and who they want to sleep with.”As previously announced,Beverley Knight will play rock’n’roll pioneer Sister Rosetta Tharpein the Minerva during the summer. At Christmas, a musical version of The Three Little Pigs by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe will be co-produced with the Unicorn.Audibert has stressed the affordability of the season, with tickets available from £10 for every show. Theatregoers aged 16 to 30 can buy £5 tickets if they sign up to the freePrologue scheme.Explore more on these topicsTheatreChichester Festival theatreGiles TereraJustin AudibertHamletnewsShareReuse this content"

But Ravenhill is now set to unveil a staggering 10 new full-length plays over two days, performed by a cast of 80 actors and directed by Ravenhill.An epic cycle of bawdy modern comedies, the plays borrow from scenarios collected in a 1611 publication by the Italiancommedia dell’arteactor and manager Flaminio Scala. Ravenhill said he had been attracted to the “generosity of spirit and comic energy” of the scenarios. “They are sexually frank, with the women given as much agency as the men. They are socially acute, depicting the newly rich mixing with the urban poor and new migrants from the countryside. They are grounded in money, sex and the body.” Collectively, the storylines depict a world “in which we are all fools and we all need to find a way to get along”. His aim, Ravenhill said, was not to make a historical reconstruction but “to write plays that allow contemporary audiences to laugh and to celebrate our shared humanity”.The 90-minute plays were written over the past year – roughly one a month – as Ravenhill collaborated with actors in workshops run by the organisationRun at It Shouting(named after the advice Paul McGann’s character is given when faced with a “randy” bull in the film Withnail and I). Ravenhill’s cycle of plays has been given the collective title Run at It Laughing. The series of rehearsed readings will take place atWilton’s Music Hallin east London, starting at noon on 9 May and finishing the next evening.View image in fullscreenCommedia dell’arte actors, probably from Compagnia dei Gelosi, including Isabella Andreini.Photograph: AlamyTickets for individual plays will be available and audiences with enough stamina can book for the full sequence. “Each of the plays puts the same characters in different situations,” said Ravenhill. “There’s a cumulative pleasure in seeing several … As you get to know the characters, there’s an extra level of comedy and recognition. Much as there is with contemporary sitcom.” Tickets for the first play are £12, with subsequent plays priced at £8. A “weekend pass” costs £40.Actors from the workshops will take part in the rehearsed readings. “There were no written scenes or dialogues in [Scala’s] volume,” Ravenhill explained. “Simply a four-page outline for each of the plays. The plays had been improvised, using the scenarios, in the 1570s and 1580s by an Italian troupe [Compagnia dei Gelosi, which translates as “Company of Jealous Ones”]. These were the first fully professional actors in Europe and the first to include women as equal members of the company. One of these female actors, Isabella Andreini, became the most famous performer of her day.” Andreini was also a notable poet and playwright.The scenarios’ influence can be seen in works by Shakespeare, Lope de Vega and Molière, said Ravenhill. “But, being improvised, the influence of these plays has mostly been forgotten.”View image in fullscreenTitle page of Flaminio Scala’s collectionProfits from the event will be donated to theNia Project, which runs services for women and girls who have been subjected to sexual and domestic violence and abuse.Ravenhill’s recent plays include a ghost story,The Haunting of Susan A, which ran at the King’s Head theatre in north London when he was joint artistic director from 2021-23. During that time the theatre celebrated its 50th anniversary and moved from the back room of a London pub to abigger, purpose-built home.In 2024, the Royal Shakespeare Company staged Ravenhill’s playBen and Imo, which was originally written for the centenary of Benjamin Britten’s birth and performed on BBC Radio 3 in 2013. The play charts the relationship between the composer and the musician Imogen Holst as they work together on an opera to celebrate the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953. Erica Whyman’s production, starring Samuel Barnett and Victoria Yeates, transfers to theOrange Tree theatrein London next month.Explore more on these topicsTheatreMark RavenhillComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Wilton's Music HallnewsShareReuse this content"

Their contributions not only had a profound impact on their fields but also continue to inspire generations.”View image in fullscreenMarc Bolan.Photograph: Roger Bamber/REX/ShutterstockBolan, the enigmatic frontman of T Rex, was known for his flamboyant style and electrifying stage presence. He captivated audiences with his fusion of rock, folk, and glittering theatrics, making hits such as Get It On and Ride a White Swan staples of the era.His iconic look, featuring sequins, feather boas, and platform boots became the quintessential aesthetic of Glam Rock, and also challenged traditional notions of masculinity. The plaque will mark one of his west London addresses.Hepburn’s early years in London, during which she transitioned from ballet to acting, will be commemorated with a blue plaque in Mayfair.During this formative period, Hepburn landed her first film and stage roles, including her Broadway debut in Gigi. It was also while living in the city that her Oscar-winning portrayal of Princess Ann in Roman Holiday (1953) cemented her status as a Hollywood icon and an enduring symbol of grace and style.View image in fullscreenUna Marson.Composite: Getty imagesMarson was one of the most influential Black figures of the 20th century. As the first Black woman to be employed as a programme assistant, and later as the first Black producer at the BBC, she spearheaded a wave of change in British broadcasting.This included creating and producing programmes such as Calling the West Indies, which connected Caribbean service personnel in Britain with their families back home, and Caribbean Voices, which became a vital platform for emerging Caribbean writers.Pym became known for her witty, insightful portrayals of single women’s lives following her debut novel Some Tame Gazelle (1950). She will be commemorated in Pimlico, from where her best-loved and best-known novel, Excellent Women, draws its inspiration and setting.Sutherland captured the essence of natural and human forms in ways that challenged traditional artistic conventions. His 1954 portrait of Churchill highlighted his ability to provoke and engage with public discourse. The plaque will mark his childhood home in the suburbs of London.The blue plaques scheme, which celebrates the link between significant figures of the past and the buildings in which they lived and worked, runs on public suggestions. English Heritage said all blue plaques were subject to full property owner approval.Explore more on these topicsHeritageLondonAudrey HepburnEnglish HeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

He would be unlikely to endorse the warty portrait of his political idol in Howard Brenton’sChurchill in Moscow. And now, in The Autobiography of a Cad, an egotistical, Shakespeare-quoting, wildly reproductive Old Etonian and Oxonian Tory looks back on a public life in memoirs that prove to be unreliable and self-serving.Some relief for the former prime minister is that Edward Fox-Ingleby becomes a broader portrait of privileged chancers in English public life. He gives a Sunak-like oration in a downpour, lounges on a Commons bench in the Rees-Mogg manner, suffers David Cameron and Liz Truss’s overconfidence about their political nous, leans towards the biographical inaccuracy of Jeffrey Archer and shares Prince Andrew’s appetite for shooting weekends (though not pizza).However, this adaptation by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman of a 1939 novel by the Scottish author AG Macdonell faces the problem that drama typically forces a protagonist towards a moment of shame or self-knowledge, neither of which these sorts possess. (Johnson’s autobiography Unleashed has the same problem.) At least in the play, there is counterpoint to the torrential self-justification. Hislop and Newman, as alumni of Private Eye, are well-placed to challenge Fox-Ingleby with satisfying satire of precisely how he keeps getting away with it, through manipulation of the British political and media establishments.View image in fullscreenConfidence trick … Rhiannon Neads, James Mack and Mitesh Soni.In the colossal title role – in effect, a two-hour interrupted monologue – James Mack can’t quite solve the mystery of how such a chap gets so much money and sex but suggests how the confidence trick might work. Ceci Calf’s design richly fills every theatre wall with portraits of the cad’s ancestors, who Mack picks out with a riding crop like an oil-painting PowerPoint.Rhiannon Neads and Mitesh Soni quick-change from main roles as the autobiographer’s secretary and (thankless in every sense) factchecker to other figures. She impresses as an alarming aunt and he as a college enemy who, in an Anthony Powell-ish way, haunts the rotter’s rise.Macdonell’s England, Their England – which Tom Stoppard identified as a key book in his happy Anglicisation as a Czech immigrant – gently sends up the best of the country, such as cricket.

There are notable exceptions of course, most recentlyDaniel Barenboim’s version with the Berlin Staatskapelle, there’s even a version conducted by Yevgeny Svetlanov with the USSR Symphony Orchestra and British singers, while two of John Barbirolli’s three recordings were made with the New York Philharmonic and the Orchestra of RAI in Rome. But here we have a British conductor,Nicholas Collon, recording Gerontius with a Finnish orchestra and a mixed chorus of Finnish and British singers, in a performance taken from a concert in Helsinki last April.View image in fullscreenElgar: The Dream of Gerontius album art.Photograph: OndineIt’s a very distinguished addition to the pantheon of Gerontius recordings, conducted by Collon with acute sensitivity to the tiniest nuances in Elgar’s score. Timings may suggest that overall it is one of the faster versions on record, but nothing about it feels rushed or overpressed; both the solo sections and the great choral set pieces have just the right spaciousness, and all the necessary dramatic bite when required in sections like the Demons chorus, while the exchanges between Gerontius and the Angel in the second part of the oratorio are never made too overtly operatic nor too piously formal.The impressive Gerontius is the young Scottish tenorJohn Findon, with the right heroic edge to his tone in his moments of extremity but a softer, more lyrical core in moments of reflection. Both the mezzo and baritone parts are taken by singers who have regularly sung the work in concert but never recorded it before. Christine Rice is a fabulously sympathetic Angel and, praise indeed, as good as any on disc since Janet Baker, whileRoderick Williamsmay lack the ideal weight and darkness of tone for the Priest and the Angel of the Agony, but more than compensates for that in the way in which typically he shapes and point every phrase so purposefully; his contribution is as thoughtful as every other element in Collon’s performance.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

Initially framed as the dream of the young girl seen heading for bed during the overture – its heroes, villains, and monsters conjured up from her toy box and a fractious family life – things turn starker and darker in Sarastro’s palace, where misogyny and casual corruption undermine any cultish declamations about truth and love.It’s still not a wholly satisfactory staging – the final tableau in particular is so enigmatic that the audience on opening night were audibly uncertain the show had ended, and forays into feminism also feel underdeveloped – but its humour and dramatic momentum are admirable, and there’s a healthy helping of kooky visual appeal courtesy of Colin Richmond’s sets and Douglas O’Connell’s video designs.While a number of the cast return from the autumn run, there’s also a clutch of notable firsts among the principals. Tenor Trystan Llŷr Griffiths makes hisOpera Northdebut as Tamino – a Perrault-style Prince Charming with just a touch of Lohengrin in both voice and manner – as does soprano Nazan Fikret as a gleaming, formidable Queen of the Night, her accustomed ease apparent in what has become a signature role. Soraya Mafi, meanwhile, makes an exceptional role debut as a tenacious and principled Pamina: sung with thrilling assurance and swooning lyricism, she’s a princess well worth trials by fire and ice.View image in fullscreenSassy trio: Charlie Drummond, Katie Sharpe and Hazel Croft in The Magic Flute at Opera North.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianFresh from last month’sLove Life, bass-baritone Justin Hopkins is an icily charismatic Sarastro, labouring a little over his lowest notes but singing with appealing richness of tone elsewhere, and Andri Björn Róbertsson remains a towering Speaker in every sense. There are welcome returns, too, from chorus members Charlie Drummond, Katie Sharpe and Hazel Croft as a sassy trio of bewimpled, lightsaber-toting Ladies, and tenor Colin Judson as a grubbily lecherous Monostatos. And, best of all among the returnees are Emyr Wyn Jones’s wildman Papageno and Pasquale Orchard’s sparky Papagena: comic timing sharpened, and accents (Welsh and New Zealand respectively) gloriously intact, they’re the double-act of dreams – and Jones’s mellifluous baritone in particular seems to have gained depth even since September.One further debutant is arguably the making of this revival. In his first (and surely not last) appearance with the company, conductorPatrick Lange’s fleet-footed tempi and knack for colour have the Orchestra of Opera North playing at the top of their game: a Magic Flute brimming with all the light and humanity which its final chorus proclaims.At the Grand theatre, Leeds, until 22 February.Then touring until 29 March.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicOperaOpera NorthreviewsShareReuse this content"

Who am I again? What am I here to do? Who are all these people? It’s been a golden time for fantasy lately and having inhaledDragon’s Dogma 2,Metaphor: ReFantazio, both seasons ofHouse of the Dragonand all of Rebecca Yarros’s Fourth Wing novels in less than a year, I’m starting to blur the finer details of one kingdom with another.Avowed’s fantasy universe comes ready-made, from developer Obsidian’s other Pillars of Eternity games. The lore is dense, the in-game text plentiful and characters verbose, but thankfully The Living Lands is fascinating to look at and the realm of Eora full of political tension and cool monsters. I remember precious few names or historical details, but I will remember several of my experiences in this game – the view from the rickety path hugging the walls of an underground cavern big enough for a mad priest to have built as gigantic automaton inside, and the skin-crawling secret I discovered in the basement of a companion’s family home. The look is Annihilation-meets-Oblivion, with fungal and floral detail embroidering the structures and peoples you encounter, and and ever-present tension between the organic and the corruptive.The Living Lands is being ravaged by a disturbing plague that sends people mad, before they are consumed by mushroom-like growths. You, an envoy from a distant centre of empire, have been sent to investigate. You are a godlike, touched by the immortals, and you are guided through this strange place by a divine voice in your head and a range of native companions, whose chatter I found genuinely edifying. There’s a lot of choice and self-direction in Avowed, and it’s a game that always respects your intelligence. Characters are interestingly (if densely) written and there are plenty of ways to respond to them. It’s a lot less patronising than the cringeworthily Whedon-esque good guy/bad guy/joker responses that other games force out of you.I expected a brisk 20-hour adventure in the vein of Obsidian’s sci-fi comedy The Outer Worlds, but reader, this isnot that. This game is immense. I took my time in the opening area of Dawnshore, having a fine old time probing into spider-webbed caverns (there are lots of those, this is not a game for the arachnophobic) and combing through ornate, abandoned ruins and climbing lighthouses looking for loot. (This was partly because I stalled on the main quest, having forgotten a vital piece of information that popped up once in a text tutorial for about five seconds.) Only after 15 hours in this pleasant coastal land did I meet one of the central antagonists, an impressively frightening warlord in intricate armour and a mask with smouldering eyes. I then found myself in a dense and rotting jungle-swamp full of surprisingly cheerful necromancers, and it was evenbiggerthan Dawnshore. When I arrived at a third new location after around 30 hours I realised that I very much did not have the measure of this world at all.Unfortunately Avowed would be better if itwere20 hours long. I always had fun striking out from town and getting lost, coming across interesting things to do exactly as you would in Skyrim or Fallout. But there are two sticky problems that suck the fun out of it over time. The first is common to a lot of open-world games: when you arrive in a new place, all the quests and fights are a little too hard. After a few hours’ questing, exploring and upgrading your weapons and armour, it hits a brief sweet spot where everything feels challenging but conquerable. Then you empower yourself to such an extent everything gets too easy, and it starts to feel like a box-ticking exercise. This pattern repeated itself over my time with the game, eroding my patience.The second issue is that Avowed’s combat just isn’t as fun as it thinks it is, and there’sso much of it. There are an impressive number of weapons and techniques available to you – grimoires and wands for spells, giant two-handed axes, bows and pistols, maces and shields. No matter what you choose, though, it feels imprecise and tedious, and your chances of success are determined by invisible numbers rather than skill. Try to take on enemies above your level and it will barely matter how well you dodge out of the path of a greatsword or how cleverly you combine your magic effects to freeze and shatter undead skeletons. What matters is the quality of your gear, which must be continually and laboriously upgraded with a warehouse’s worth of random materials that you find in every chest and lockbox. I got very sick of smashing R2 to fire magic projectiles or hack away at tree-monsters with my sword, chipping away determinedly at their hit points. My companions never felt especially helpful in battles, either.All the variety and texture that can be found in the fiction here is lacking in the combat and the loot. There are unique swords and trinkets at the ends of the most interesting quests, but the fun of exploring is tempered by the realisation that outside of the views and the characters, you’ll rarely find anything that interesting. If you come across a powerful enemy, you may well be underpowered for the fight. If you find a tantalising glowing chest in a cavern, there’s a strong chance it’ll be full of pennies, chunks of iron and a few pelts.Avowed started out as Obsidian’s answer to Bethesda’s Elder Scrolls series, and it did remind me a lot of Oblivion and Skyrim in the exciting moments where I stumbled across something unexpected in the wilds. But it also shares those games’ tendency towards repetition, and the weightless feel of their fighting. My first 15 or so hours in The Living Lands felt rich with potential, but I got fed up with it long before the end.Avowed is released on 18 February; £59.99skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Could any play be more timely than Caryl Churchill’s Escaped Alone, with its apocalyptic visions of raging fires, a God who punishes gender dysphoria and a wind that “turned heads inside out”?First seen in 2016, this startling chamber piece juxtaposes the inconsequential chitchat of four retired women with alarming descriptions of planetary destruction. Structured like a string quartet in which fluttering exchanges alternate with soulful solos, it is sometimes a leisurely free association, ranging from antiques to cats, soap opera to superpowers, and sometimes a terrifying catalogue of rising waters, miscarriages and societal collapse.In Sarah Frankcom’s crisp, ethereal production, Maureen Beattie is cast as a gnomic outsider. In the part of Mrs Jarrett, she shuffles on stage with a shopping trolley, hair matted, head stooped, at once friends with the other three women and detached. Her clothes are more dowdy, her posture more tense. Even her Glasgow accent (mocked by Annette Badland’s Vi) sets her apart in this English company. She frowns as if struggling to keep up with an alien language. She stands, hands clasped, while the others sit.View image in fullscreenAddressing our sense of powerlessness … Annette Badland and Danielle Henry in What If If Only.Photograph: Johan PerssonAnd it is Mrs Jarrett, like a seer, who switches into the bleakest of monologues, as if unable to reconcile the banality of the back-garden chat with the enormity of the environmental threat. Beattie performs the dark poetry with trance-like intensity.More Life review – death-cheating tech drama is incredibly humanRead moreBut the rest is not entirely inane. Churchill is too subtle a writer for that. In the assured hands of Badland, Souad Faress and Margot Leicester, the conversation confounds, surprises and amuses, even as it spirals in its own direction. There are dark corners here too.After the interval, the playwright again addresses our sense of powerlessness in the short and stimulating What If If Only (first seen in 2021) in which Danielle Henry plays a young woman facing up to the “ghost of a future that never happened”. On a stage filled with possible futures, including one promising “equality and cake”, she can, like theatre itself, only ever live in the moment.At theRoyal Exchange theatre, Manchester, until 8 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreCaryl ChurchillRoyal ExchangeSarah FrankcomreviewsShareReuse this content"

She had answered an ad looking for women with no qualifications save for a clear voice and a self-assured manner. Callers would pay 50p a minute to speak to girls working in the small hours in the attic of a tatty office building. On arrival, Stripe observed staff at partitioned desks in jeans, jumpers and no makeup “fake laughing [on the phone] as though they are hosting the world’s greatest party”, along with the “sickly and overpowering” scent of Exclamation. That was the perfume worn by the manager, Viv – so strong it made everyone’s eyes water.Stripe’s foray into the world of phone sex features in Base Notes, a literary voyage through her formative moments and the perfumes – some pleasant, some less so – she encountered along the way. Stripe is the author ofBlack Teeth and a Brilliant Smile, a novel based on the life of playwright and screenwriter Andrea Dunbar; Ten Thousand Apologies, a tale of rock’n’roll excess co-written with Lias Saoudi of Fat White Family; as well as several volumes of poetry.Stripe’s pal Debs, who worked with her dressing windows in a department store, favoured Thierry Mugler’s AngelThis is her first memoir and it is written in the second person, giving the impression of the present-day Stripe observing her younger self, a working-class girl from the north, from the more secure vantage point of middle age. The theme of each chapter is a perfume worn by family, friends, work colleagues or by Stripe herself. In the seaside ballrooms where her hair stylist mother took part in hairdressing competitions, Giorgio Beverly Hills was the fragrance of choice. Stripe’s pal Debs, who worked with her dressing windows in an Edinburgh department store, favoured Thierry Mugler’s Angel, although she wasn’t the only one in its thrall; in town, “the sweaty walls of every nightclub drip with it”. Elsewhere, Jean Paul Gaultier’s Le Male, Fabergé Brut, The Body Shop’s Dewberry and Impulse body mist feature. For Stripe, perfume is entwined with memory, each one helping to draw out aspects of her former self, even though the recollections aren’t always fond. The book’s epigraph is taken, amusingly, from the song Perfume by Sparks: “The olfactory sense is the sense that most strongly evokes memories of the past. Well, screw the past!”Growing up, Stripe was a quiet girl with a rich interior life. Her mother was an extrovert who couldn’t relate to her seemingly sullen daughter. “‘Why can’t you be more like the salon girls?’ she asks. ‘Bubbly and loud. At the very least,normal… I may love you but I don’t have to like you.’” None of this seemed to dampen her adventurous spirit, which bordered on reckless when she visited New York by herself. There she spent a terrifying night at the apartment of a stranger who seemed like a good Samaritan until she caught him spying on her in the shower. She later moved to London where she picked up various dead-end jobs, partied hard and drank like a fish. A low point came when she agreed to give an interview to a documentary film crew making a TV reality series, serving up her darkest secrets for public consumption to the horror of her family.Bleakness and humour go hand in hand in Base Notes, never more so than in Stripe’s unflinching account of her mother’s decline and death after collapsing on a cruise with a septic hernia following a champagne-and-lobster banquet – “her own version of the last supper”. This is a book that, rather than opting for blow-by-blow autobiography, provides candid and compelling snapshots of a life, much of which is spent in survival mode. While the dialogue captures the complexities of friendship and family dynamics, the writing really comes to life through Stripe’s child’s-eye observations. Whether earwigging on her grandmother’s bible meetings, or reporting on goings-on in her mother’s salon, the scenes are richly observed and often laced with sardonic humourIf, on occasion, the olfactory theme feels laboured, it comes together in the final chapter as Stripe tries making her own perfume in Grasse, France, as a tribute to her mother. She selects mandarin, English breakfast tea, lychees and lotus for a fragrance that she calls Lune Rose. On being handed the bottle, she is told not to open it for at least six weeks. When she finally does, it is not the “precious concoction of your imagination” but a scent redolent of a “cheap copy bought for £3 in the middle aisle of Aldi”. Sometimes, she concludes, “the best laid plans don’t always work out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Paragon of Black Country respectability, a “real-life Roy of the Rovers” (so said Terry Venables), the late Manchester United midfielder’s myth is as surely set as his bronze quiff. InBest and Edwards, his remarkable book about footballing fame and tragedy, Gordon Burn quotes the Austrian philosopher Robert Musil: “There is nothing as invisible as a monument.” Despitethe statue’s prominent site on the edge of Dudley’s market square, only ageing Man United pilgrims and curious travellers pause to admire it.View image in fullscreenA 1950s sweetshop in the open-air Black Country Living Museum in Dudley.Photograph: Neil McAllister/AlamyDudley’s town centre in winter drizzle is hard to appreciate, but at its edges are fine buildings: a neo-Georgian town hall and turreted former police station; a handsome Eros who has shot his arrow; the deco-influenced Fountain Arcade, dated 1925; a “sports bar”, called the Old Glasshouse, which occupies a Victorian fire station.The pint of mild and ham cob at the Bottle & Glass has me almost teary with delightA tram line is being built to connect to Wednesbury, whence to Birmingham. Canals already do this. I set off to find an entry point, my route taking me past asculpture(reels of film) dedicated to the film director James Whale – his 1931 Frankenstein established horror as a viable commercial genre and the idea of the monster as a monobrowed blockhead. Maybe the bolts through his neck were industrial Dudley’s contribution.Noise levels dip as soon as I step on to the towpath, behind a wall of chaotic shrubbery. More than 500 miles of canals crisscross the West Midlands, built to link up factories and get goods to market. Dudley had coal and limestone mining, iron, steel, engineering, glass cutting, textiles and leatherworking. The town made cranes, chains, anchors (including the 15-ton centre anchor for RMS Titanic), nails, fire grates, anvils, vices. Much has gone, but I hear clangs and bangs as I amble.View image in fullscreenShri Venkateswara (Balaji) Temple in Dudley.Photograph: Kalki/AlamySpotting a snack bar behind a palisade fence, I detour and find myself inside theShri Venkateswara (Balaji) Temple; its impressive granitegopura(pyramidal tower) takes inspiration from a mother temple in Tirupati, south India.

The 1968 house is close enough to my childhood to prompt memory sensations. The vintage chocolate bars in the corner shop, just for show, likewise. The pint of mild and ham cob at the Bottle & Glass – bare benches, bay window, open fire – has me almost teary with delight. The assemblage of periods and outlets feels political: a localist mini-universe, preserved to provoke. The Living Museum’s timeline is 1712-1968: the Industrial Revolution’s outer limits. I exit, stepping back into 2025, in a hazy, wondering dreamlike state, thinking someone should send Beckham, or Ronaldo, to fetch that ball.Things to see and do:Himley Hall and Park,Dudley Time Trail,Duncan Edwards’s grave.Enniskillen, County FermanaghView image in fullscreenWall murals on the exterior of Pat’s Bar at Enniskillen.Photograph: Jackie Ellis/AlamyEnniskillen – the Island of Kathleen, Queen of the Fomorians, supernatural raiders from the sea – is at the confluence of Lower and Upper Lough Erne. North and south lie countless islands, and an amphibious ecology of rushes and reeds, waterfowl and waders. For my visit, the Atlantic was sending in great waves of rain to top it all up. The steep streets were waterfalls.Enniskillen was founded in 1612 by a charter issued by the earthly invader James VI and I. Cambridge-educated Captain William Cole was awarded agrant of land, upon which he planted a church, school, jail/court and houses for burgesses. He built bridges and refurbished and added a tower to Enniskillen Castle – which had been the medieval seat of the Maguire (Mag Uidhir) chieftains of Fermanagh. A market house and “diamond” (town square) – a common feature of Plantation towns – were placed at the centre.The signage conjures ghosts and old ways. Wall murals celebrate former inhabitants, including Oscar WildeEnniskillen’s streets have their previous functions displayed on ceramic plaques. Queen Street was formerly Barracks Street and Brewery Lane. Belmore Street was Gaol Street. Hospital Lane became Preaching Lane, which later became Wesley Street. Eden Street was Pudding Lane, after the offal from slaughterhouses. The signage, by artistEleanor Wheeler, conjures ghosts and old ways.Wall muralscelebrate former inhabitants, including Oscar Wilde, who attended the Portora Royal school. Anoversized chess set– with 32 pieces and 64 cubes spread around bars and cafes – pays homage to keen chess player Samuel Beckett, another Portora alumnus.View image in fullscreenBlakes of the Hollow bar in Enniskillen – the ‘cathedral’ of pubs.Photograph: scenicireland.com/Christopher Hill Photographic/AlamyPerhaps plaques and street art help Enniskilleners recall the insular lifestyle of yore. There’s a powerful appetite for the past here.The Workhouse, which opened in 1844, has been preserved as a reminder of the famine period and its aftermath, doubling as heritage centre and business hub. “With the building, its stories, its voices and its people, we see beauty and sorrow walk hand in hand,” says historian Catherine Scott, who had the site listed in 2009 when she heard it was scheduled for demolition.The high street is two big churches, shops, banks, cafes and plenty of bars. Among the pubs,Blakes of the Hollowstands out for its bright red paintwork and Victorian interior, with beautiful tiles on the floor (replicas of those in the Catholic church) and tiny wood-panelled snugs – including one where women used to drink separately. Novelist John McGahern said: “If Irish pubs were churches, Blakes (of) the Hollow would be the cathedral of them all.”Near the top of the town is the impressive Renaissance-style town hall; the Continuity IRAexploded a bomb herein 2003. At the foot of town is the run-down, largely unused Clinton Centre, on the site of the 1987Remembrance Day IRA bombing– by the town’s cenotaph – that caused 12 deaths. The Erne curls into town a few paces away from here. By the East Bridge you remember, again, it’s an island town. The rain is now a shimmering river in spate.

Gareth Southgate’s successful stints – winning the League Cup final as a player, and beating Manchester Cityby eight goals to oneas manager – linking the Boro to the national team’s destiny, sealed this status. Google searches prioritise the team and local news media conflate it with the town.The discovery of iron ore turned Middlesbrough into a foundry town – Sydney Harbour Bridge was built right hereMiddlesbrough is a port but not on the coast, a railway town but not on the mainline, a Victorian creation but not one wrapped in aspic and conservation orders. If it’s in the middle, between the religious centres of Durham and Whitby (a Benedictine priory once stood at Middlesbrough), or the Esk and the Wear rivers, it’s also at the farthest edge of its historic county: Yorkshire. “North Riding” evokes dales, moors, the safe Tory seat of Richmond, real ale; Teesside is its dark, ripped-out workers’ heart.Hardly bigger than a village when the church of St Hilda’s was consecrated in 1840, Middlesbrough grew on the back of the Stockton & Darlington Railway. This was extended to the staithes at Port Middlesbrough, from which Durham coal was exported far and wide. Wharves were built, workshops constructed and lifting engines installed.View image in fullscreenThe Tees Transporter Bridge, which opened in 1911.Photograph: Philip Silverman/Getty ImagesAs Middlesbrough grew, its boundaries expanded south of the railway. The older northern area is sometimes known as “Over the Border” – an impression reinforced by the A66. Much has been demolished, including St Hilda’s (captured by Lowry in 1959) and the oldest pub, the Ship Inn. Somewhat stranded survivors are the small Italianate-style 1846 town hall,Queen’s Terraceand the French baroque formerNational and Provincial Bank.The discovery of major iron ore deposits in the Cleveland Hills in the mid-19th century turned Middlesbrough into a foundry town – and a giant of heavy engineering. TheTees Transporter Bridge, opened in 1911, is the longest existing transporter bridge in the world. Sydney Harbour Bridge was built right here by Dorman Long & Co Ltd. Middlesbrough Ironopolis FC won the Northern League three times in its five-year history. More than 30 pubs slaked the collective thirst; they are gone or lie inruins.Middlesbrough grew from 25 people in 1801 to over 90,000 by 1900. There was barely room to breathe. It has been called a “town famous for its asthmatic qualities”. Locals have reappropriated the put-down nickname “Smoggies”, proud of their working history. But the “burgh” in the “middle” is also between blast furnaces and green hills, a would-be city with rural views. Pig iron. Soft hearts. Strong heads. A down-to-earth dignity characterises people who can still harbour anostalgia for the future.Things to see and do:Dorman Museum,MIMA,North York Moors national park.Chris Moss’s visits were supported by theWest Midlands Growth CompanyandVisit Ireland.Explore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysWhere tourists seldom treadShort breaksDay tripsEngland holidaysNorthern Ireland holidaysCultural tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"
