Is it good if it hurts? How should I structure my workouts? Everything you need to know about resistance training, from the expertsJoe StoneFri 26 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 12.53 EDTShareWeightlifting is rapidly joining wild swimming, the Beckham family feud and lurching towards fascism as a national obsession. And with good cause. Also known as resistance training, pumping iron is about more than aspiring to look like a Love Islander. It’s been shown to boost your immune system, prevent cognitive decline and even reverse the ageing process. More than your weight or BMI, increased muscle mass is considered one of the strongest indicators of longevity, withone decade-long studyfinding that it correlates with lower risk of death from all major causes. Unsure where to begin? We asked the experts.Will weightlifting make me bulky?“This is a myth that has held women back for far too long,” saysElizabeth Davies, author of the forthcoming book Training For Your Old Lady Body: A No Bullsh*t Guide to Help Women Reframe Exercise. “For the majority of women, to build lots of visible muscle requires a hugely dedicated approach to your training and nutrition. It’s not something that just happens by accident. So please don’t let that be a reason not to start. If you find that you are developing more muscle than you’d like, just end your workout when you have a bit more left in the tank.”Are you ever too young or old to start?“We used to believe that if children engaged in strength training it might stunt their growth, but that has been debunked,” says Davies. “We know now that if they are being supervised, then age-appropriate resistance training is safe and beneficial for children and adolescents, helping to improve their strength, build bone density, develop coordination and boost confidence.”And weightlifting as an older person? “It is true that an older muscle isn’t as responsive to weightlifting as a younger muscle, but that doesn’t mean you don’t get quite significant benefits,” saysLeigh Breen, honorary professor of translational muscle physiology at the University of Birmingham. “Studies have shown quite dramatic improvements in muscle mass and strength in older adults who do strength training, with minimal to nonexistent adverse effects, even in those aged 90 and above.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Vchal/ShutterstockHow often should you train?“Guidelines from the chief medical officer in the UK state that adults should aim to do at leasttwo resistance strength training sessionsa week,” says Breen. “There will be benefits if you can lift three or four times a week, but there’s a risk that you start to neglect aerobic exercise, which also has numerous health benefits.”According to Nick Finney, a personal trainer whose clients have included Robbie Williams and J-Lo: “There’s nothing to stop you exercising every day, but you shouldn’t be lifting weights every day. You need recovery time in order for your muscles to adapt, so it becomes counterproductive to hit the same muscle groups day after day. If you love exercise, that’s not to stop you doing cardio or yoga or mobility on the days that you aren’t lifting. I always encourage people to get the most out of the minimum, and to be consistent. For most people it just wouldn’t be realistic to train for five or six days a week and keep that up for years.”How do you know how much to lift?“Generally, people should aim to lift between 70% and 80% of what we call their one repetition maximum (the load that they estimate they could move only once before they fail) for about 10 reps,” says Breen. “You can test this out. If, for instance, you can lift a weight 20 times at 50% effort, then your muscle is not working hard enough to grow. In that scenario, you would aim to increase the load until you can only manage 10 to 15 reps before you feel close to failure.”Finney says: “If you want ultimate muscle growth, I like the final set to be five reps to failure – so that the last rep is a struggle. Prior to that you might have done a warmup set of 12 reps at a lower weight, and a middle set of eight reps at a medium weight. If you can manage eight reps on your final set, then you’re going too light.”Are reps or weight more important?“Assuming you’d like to increase your muscle mass, what’s important is volume,” says Breen. “Your muscle doesn’t know how you place high demand on it, it just knows it’s fatigued. You can do this in one of two ways; either by lifting a heavy weight a few times or lowering the weight and doing more repetitions.”Davies adds: “Heavier weights are more effective for building absolute strength – the most you can lift for a single rep, sometimes known as a one-rep max. So, if I was trying to build my deadlift to get as heavy as possible, I’d need to practise with fewer reps and heavy weights. Part of building strength is skill, and part of it is neurological adaptation. So you need to practise working close to your max in order for your nervous system to adapt.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ratpack223/Getty Images/iStockphotoIs it good or bad if it hurts?“There are different types of pain,” says Davies. “If you are performing a squat and your knee is hurting, I would reduce the weight, reduce your squat depth and see if that stops the pain. Often when we experience discomfort after a workout, this is delayed onset muscle soreness (Doms). This is really common when you do something novel; for instance, if you’ve ever tried a new class and been very sore the next day. It usually kicks in 24 hours after a workout, peaks on day two and is resolved after 72 hours.“I really encourage people to stick with the same exercises for at least eight weeks, because there is something called the repeated bout effect, which means that once you start repeating the same stimulus on the body, the Doms vanishes, even when you’re increasing the weight or the reps.”Breen concurs: “The idea that soreness is the catalyst to muscle growth is false. If you have an injury that doesn’t go away, that requires attention from a physiotherapist or other specialist.”How do you know when to progress?“The core principle of resistance training is progressive overload, which simply means doing more over time,” says Davies. “The body is really, really adaptable – and to keep it adapting, you have to keep gradually increasing that stimulus. The really important thing is to work with a rep range, because otherwise it’s going to be complete guesswork. For a beginner, a nice rep range could be six to 12 reps per set, using a weight that feels challenging enough for that rep range. A beginner might be increasing that load every single week, and then there’s going to be a point where things slow down a little bit. But the goal, even years into training, is always applying progressive overload.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

That said, using free weights gets you moving in patterns which really carry over well into everyday life; for instance, a squat is very similar to getting up off the sofa, a deadlift is very similar to picking up compost at the garden centre.”Finney is an advocate of free weights, especially for newcomers to the gym. “There’s an argument that if you’re a beginner, you should be learning the basics and nailing foundational moves, such as squats and bench presses, rather than using machines,” he says. “If you’re unsure what you’re doing, it’s worth having one or two sessions with a personal trainer to show you the basics – even if they just give you one routine for upper and one for lower body. If you can afford it, seeing someone just once a month is helpful because they can do a check‑in and prevent any bad habits.”Should I be takingcreatine?“There aren’t many sports supplements with bona fide claims about their efficacy,but creatine is one of them,” says Breen. “It effectively makes muscles more energy efficient and gives you a small increase in muscle growth and strength. More recently, people are talking about non-muscle health benefits of creatine, with a growing body of work demonstrating that creatine supplementation may have positive effects on brain health and cognition as well. That said, I wouldn’t advise taking it if you aren’t training. Most guidance states that you should aim for about 5g a day, which can be consumed in pill form or in a powder that dissolves easily in a drink. If you have an existing kidney issue then consult your GP, because creatine supplementation can alter some of the blood markers that are associated with kidney function.”How should I structure my workouts?“If you’re trying to hit the guidelines of strength training twice a week, then I’d make both full-body workouts to be sure you’re targeting all the main muscle groups,” advises Breen. “Within that, you want to ensure you’re doing as many compound exercises as possible – these are exercises that work many different muscle groups at once and include pull-ups, push-ups, squats, lunges and deadlifts.”If you’re able to work out more than twice a week, Finney suggests thinking about a split that targets different muscle groups on different days. “The stronger you get, the more recovery the body needs. If you’re squatting heavy weights, you’re going to need to take a break of a couple of days before training legs again. Some people choose to do upper and lower body workouts, and some people split it into leg days, push days (chest and triceps) and pull days (back and biceps). Because these are opposing muscle groups, doing this means you can work out on consecutive days without them affecting each other.”What are the best moves to master?“The most important thing is to have a balanced programme that targets all the key movement patterns,” says Davies. “So I would love to see someone training a knee-dominant movement (eg a squat or a lunge), a hip-dominant movement (eg a glute bridge or a deadlift), a vertical push movement (eg a shoulder press), a horizontal push movement (eg a bench press or a pull-up), a vertical pull movement (eg a pull-up) and a horizontal pull (eg a bent-over row). If you’re including those movements, you’ve got a nice solid starting point.”Is there a best time of day to lift weights?“Chronobiology is a relatively new field,” says Breen. “There’s some suggestion that the time of day when animals perform strengthening exercises can alter the effect, but human studies aren’t very comprehensive. Things like your alcohol intake and stress levels will have a bigger impact than the time of day that you go to the gym.”Finney adds: “In general, I would say exercise in the morning, because then it’s done and there’s less chance of you cancelling because you’re tired or something has got in the way. It also positively affects your behaviour for the rest of the day – you eat better because you’re conscious that you don’t want to undo the good effort that you’ve made, and you feel the benefit of the endorphins. That said, it’s about personal preference. If you love training in the evening, do not force yourself to train in the morning. And if you’re trying to get bigger, it can help to have eaten a couple of meals in order to power your lifts.”According to Davies: “The best time of day to weightlift is the time of day that you can weightlift. If you are a parent and the only time you can do it is at 7pm, do it at 7pm. If you are somebody with a busy career and the only time you can do it is 5am, do it at 5am. Make it fit with your lifestyle.”Japanese interval walking: the viral exercise trend that could put a spring in your stepRead moreWhat should I eat before and after lifting?“What you eat before isn’t of huge importance,” says Breen. “You just want to make sure that you are appropriately fuelled, ideally with a wholefood meal incorporating some carbohydrates and some proteins. If you’re aiming to improve your body composition by gaining muscle and losing fat, then having a sugary sports drink before exercise isn’t going to help.“Your muscle metabolism remains altered for a couple of days after your workout, so you have a two-day window of opportunity to capitalise on that muscle response by ensuring every meal and snack includes some protein (which contains amino acids, the building blocks of muscle). It all depends on body weight, but the general guidance is to try and consume 20-30g of protein in each meal after a workout. Having said that, the most important thing to do is lift weights – that gives you the vast majority of the response you’re looking for. The protein is the cherry on the cake.”Explore more on these topicsFitnessWeightliftingTraining programmesHealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Finally, the prime minister would spell out the progressive, patriotic answer to a summer of far-right hate, culminating in Elon Musk’s bloodcurdlingdeclaration that “violence is coming”to the streets of Britain. Yet for all its talk of renewal and confronting the politics of grievance,Friday’s speech– a warmup for what will be a longer argument at Labour’s forthcoming party conference – still sounded oddly like a surrender to Reform’s theory of where it all supposedly went wrong.Both New Labour and their Tory successors were too relaxed about legal immigration, Starmer suggested, and the left in particular has shied away from the argument about controlling Britain’s borders. To stop those with no right to be in the country from supposedly undercutting wages by working in the black market, everyone must now carry digital ID on their smartphones and show it when starting a job. Think Theresa May’s hostile environment, only this time in your pocket.Identity cards are not a new or even particularly radical idea. They’re widely accepted in Europe – French politicians have long argued that a British equivalent could help cut small boat crossings, if they made it harder for people smugglers to promise a job on arrival – and Tony Blair came close to introducing them as prime minister, though he billed them more as a means of easily accessing public services than a punitive measure. But it’s the meteoric rise of Reform UK that makes such measures both more attractive to a Labour government desperate for something to say on immigration, and arguably more risky. If this plan to beat the right by offering authoritarianism fails, then any new power this government acquires in the process would most likely fall into the hands of a Reform government at the next election, free to use it for very different ends. Suddenly, this is a gamble of very high stakes indeed.Though Britons wouldn’t have to produce their IDs when stopped on the street under Starmer’s plans, a future administration could easily change that. Just imagine how useful ID cards would be inrounding people upfor Trump-style mass deportations – especially if that effort was linked to facial recognition technology already in use by the British police, creating a system capable of automatically scanning crowds anywhere from a rush-hour Tube station to a football match and matching faces against an immigration database. (There are remarkably few legal constraints on how exactly facial recognition can be used, compared to other technologies like fingerprinting or DNA when they were introduced). Suddenly, there would be nowhere to hide. Now imagine how some future regime could potentially use such tools, perhaps not just against visa overstayers but anyone deemed an enemy of the state.Too paranoid? Maybe. It’s still far from clear that Reform can win in 2029, let alone how an instinctively libertarian party (it’s officially opposed to compulsory ID cards) would react to the powers falling into its lap. What is clear, however, is just how fast the tide is running.Less than a year ago, Nigel Farage was still insisting that Trump-style mass deportations couldn’t happen in Britain. Now, under pressure from rivals to his own right, he isthreatening to round up migrantsin their hundreds of thousands and make settled migrants with indefinite leave to remain – people whose right to be here was never previously in doubt – reapply for the right to stay. What’s frightening isn’t just how fast things are escalating but how little there is to stop them escalating further, with old norms visibly crumbling and mainstream parties in flapping disarray.Civil libertarians have long warned against handing powers to benign-seeming regimes without considering how a malign one might later use them, only to be dismissed as paranoid. Even now, a part of me feels faintly ridiculous, discussing what Big Brother Watch’s Silkie Carlo calls the “architecture of authoritarianism” – a raft of policing, security and civil powers accumulated mostly in order to combat crime – might in future be used for more sinisterly repressive purposes. Britain isn’t America, even now. But watching Donald Trump bulldoze through a written constitution makes it impossible not to wonder how Britain, with its more higgledy-piggledy ad hoc constitution, would resist an outright populist attack on its democratic institutions.Imagine a new government that moved immediately to scrap both the BBC licence fee – effectively kneecapping public service broadcasting – and the online harms bill that restrains social media’s worst excesses, while vowing to rewrite laws on hate speech it considers repressive. Mainstream politicians have floated each of those ideas in the past, so each could be presented as perfectly reasonable. But combined with Trumpian attacks on journalists considered hostile, they could swiftly add up to the chilling of the free press and an explosion of fake news online.Suppose it then announced plans to get a grip on the criminal justice system, accusing “woke” police and judges of letting ethnic minority offenders off too lightly. Chief constables who fought to defend their operational independence could easily find, as the Met’s Cressida Dick did after Sarah Everard’s murder, that governments cheered on by friendly tabloids have ways of making their lives impossible.Citizen protests against all this could easily be repressed, using measures originallyintended for activist groups like Just Stop Oil. If the House of Lords pushed back, the new government could either threaten to shrink it as Reform did in its last manifesto, or resort (as the legal blogger David Allen Green haspointed out) to more devious means, like legislating via secondary instruments that don’t require a full parliamentary vote. In this scenario, what stops Britain’s slide into something genuinely dystopian?It’s true that the famously freedom-loving Farage makes an unlikely candidate for full-fat authoritarianism, with Reform supporters if anything even more wary of big state power. But the same was once true of the Trump faithful, which hasn’t stopped himsending the National Guardinto Democrat-controlled cities. It’s surprising how many libertarians harbour deeply authoritarian instincts, just so long as it’s the other side’s freedoms being curtailed.Perhaps you think all this is hysterically overwrought, the kind of liberal handwringing that invariably cripples leftwing governments. But at the very least, the stronger and more centralised techno-stateKeir Starmerseems to envisage as the answer to the nation’s problems is a new direction for Britain and one that demands safeguards. It’s one thing building a powerful machine to destroy your enemy. It’s quite another doing so knowing that very shortly you may be handing them the keys.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The final whistle will mark the end of the beginning of a series of major women’s sports events that are being staged in the UK over the next decade. From June next year the country is hosting the Women’s T20 World Cup, and in July 2027 it will hold theGrand Départof the Tour de France Femmes. It is also bidding for the World Athletics and Para Athletics Championships in 2029, the Netball World Cup in 2031 or 2033, and, the cherry on top, has an unopposed bid in for the football’s Women’s World Cup in 2035.Whisper it, but the UK has quietly become the best venue in the world for women’s sporting tournaments. Which feels like a rare and precious thing in 21st‑century Britain: a reason to be cheerful about the state we’re in.Mitchell insists his previous final defeat can help England to Rugby World Cup gloryRead moreThis Rugby World Cup didn’t just pass the total tournament attendance set in New Zealand back in 2021, it tripled it.More than 440,000 ticketswere sold, which was 100,000 more than the organisers’ target for the competition. There will be more than 80,000 at Twickenham for the final. Canada v England will not just be the best-attended match in women’s rugby, but one of the biggest crowds in the history of women’s sport. At a time when so many countries around the world are having to withdraw bids for mega-events because of a lack of popular support, the British public are turning out for them in hundreds of thousands.“No other nation buys more sports event tickets per head than the UK,” says Esther Britten, who is the head of major events at UK Sport. “I think people have a huge desire to experience that joy, and to feel that smile on their face, and do it while actually feeling safe and included at stadiums.”There is also no doubt that women’s sport is growing a new audience. World Rugby’s data shows that 30% of the people who attended this World Cup had never been to a rugby match before. Anyone who attended a game has seen that the crowds included more women and children than you typically get at a men’s game.View image in fullscreenThe attendance figure is revealed for the England v Scotland Rugby World Cup quarter-final at Ashton Gate in Bristol.Photograph: Elsie Kibue/AlamyIt was only 15 years ago that this tournament was being played in front of crowds of 2,000 at Surrey Sports Park. The competition has shot up since and the strategy behind this edition, which was designed as a kind of rolling roadshow stopping off in a new corner of the country each weekend, means the benefit has been spread around England. This was deliberate. The funding was predicated on the money being spent outside London. “Northampton, for example, had never really hosted events of national significance before,” says Britten, “but the response that they’ve given has been phenomenal.”The tournament has provided a sense of growth, and good feeling, everywhere it’s been.“I think of it as positive societally, positive economically, and positive for sport,” says Britten. “And that is really quite unique. Not many countries have that blend of societal, economic and sporting benefit.” She’s right. Bids for sports events are often predicated on the economic impact they will have on the host cities, which tend to rely on spurious estimates. The UK does this too. “But we also see these events as an opportunity to drive civic pride, and to make people happy, and provide inspiration,” Britten adds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was a commitment to that funding staging the tournament, but there wasn’t a commitment to funding what happened after it. But we’ve made that the norm now.” More than £14m has already been distributed to the women’s rugby community in the run-up to this World Cup.Britten is as concerned with the positive social effects. She points to the volunteering programme as a good example, but you can also see it in the number of opportunities for women to be employed in key roles around the event, from the all-female ground staff at Twickenham this weekend, to the female DJs, bands and artists working in the fan zones, to the female executives on the organising committee, to the female police officers who were put in charge of security, never mind the players themselves. A lot of these opportunities simply didn’t exist in sport 15 years ago. So an awful lot of kids in this country have had a lesson in what’s possible over the last five weeks.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025England women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We all know how that panned outFri 26 Sep 2025 08.37 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShare“Whenever Westminster has gone into a moment,”Andy Burnham lamentedin one of his many interviews this week, “I have somehow been drawn into it.” Yeah, we’re alltrying to find the guywho did this. Why is this happening to Andy Burnham, this fevered speculation that Labour’s Iron Throne has his name on it, which is nowcausing cabinet ministers, the prime minister and maybe even thebond marketsto overtly or covertly slag him off? “I think what we’ve got to do,” Andy thought in another interview, “is to stop the sense in Westminster at times that everything is in flux.” Counterpoint: the sense in Westminster is that everything is completely and utterly fluxed. The wider country is considerably less optimistic.Yet is Andy Burnham the answer? The Greater Manchester mayor would certainly appear to reckon so, having worked tirelessly this week to give himself pre-title billing at his party’s imminent gathering in Liverpool. Yup, here he comes – the King of the North, the cock of the conference, the memoji of Manchester – as unafraid to chat shit to those bond markets as he was togive that press conferencein that jacket in that pandemic. The worry is that Andy is just one of those things that, during Covid, people thought were very good, but now realise are actually very bad. Like incipient alcoholism or Ted Lasso.Maybe Burnham is less bad than Keir Starmer, which isn’t exactly the Kitemark, but also not the same as having a plan. Certainly, nobody is as bad as Britain’s problems, which is the main light flashing on the dashboard, and none of Burnham’s proposals thus far – some nationalisation and some wealth taxes – touch the sides of them.In fairness, he’s not offering a policy platform at this stage, the stage where he’s implying he wants to be prime minister, not how he wants to be prime minister. It’s more of a vibe – if not to all tastes within the parliamentary Labour party. Consider the MP whotold HuffPost: “Keir should say to him, ‘Any time you want, Andy, there’ll be a seat for you, and I want you in government.’ He’d shit himself. People would see how useless he is.” Housing secretary Steve Reed is another one who seems somehow unkeen on Andy making a conference entrance like theNorth Face Kylo Ren, describing Burnham as a “regional politician”, and warning against the risk of division. Risk division at this upcoming Labour conference? No spoilers, but it’s just possible we might have passed that particular event horizon.Disappointing interjections like these seem to have been part of what sent Burnham back to the microphone: “I gave an honest answer and sometimes it feels to me that the Westminster world can’t deal with those answers.” Yeah, they can’t handle his truth. This is the Westminster world in which Burnham previously served loyally as a Blairite, a Brownite, a Corbynite and even a Starmerite, but he’d like you to know he’s been a long time out of that … swamp, would you call it? Certainly the insult “Westminster” is recurring increasingly often in Burnham’s pitch. I can’t bear the thought of him finding out where he’s going to have to work if his dream comes true.Then again, despite the week bringing this new drama, it’s hard for anyone who has lived through the past decade of political turmoil in the UK not to feel there are at least familiar elements here. Having extracted my memories of the 2017 and 2018 Conservative party conferences from the coffin of earth I’d nailed them into, I am transported back to those times when some guy made both events absolutely all about him and his will-he-won’t-he leadership bid. As you might recall, the guy was Boris Johnson, fannying about like the blancmange Uncle Scar, driving half the attenders mad with political lust and the other half just mad. The then Henley MP John Howell spoke for a significant chunk of his colleagues at the 2017 Tory conference when he said: “My message to Boris is to keep his bloody mouth shut.” By the 2018 conference, many had become so openly weary of the Johnson manoeuvring thatHowell ramped up to: “As far as I’m concerned, Boris can just fuck off.” In the 2019 Conservative leadership contest John Howell would vote – obviously, obviously – for Boris Johnson. Henley is currently represented by the Liberal Democrats.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We either get inadequate chancers (eg Johnson or Liz Truss) or chance inadequates (eg Theresa May, Rishi Sunak or Keir Starmer), all of whom are forever being presented as the next true hope. We last drew one off the chance-inadequates pile, so maybe next time round it’s fated to be an inadequate chancer – a casting call Nigel Farage could definitely nail.Andy Burnham belongs to the other pile, I think. But after the past week, and forgive this dip into Premier League history books, I now find it impossible to hear him giving it the full King of the North without thinking of Alex Ferguson’s dismissal of Paul Ince as a “big time Charlie”. Alas, some associative synaptic glitch means I now cannot hear the words “King of the North” without my brain changing them into “the Guv’nor” – a nickname that Ince bestowed upon himself, admittedly, while Andy’s was fitted to him by the media. And you know, Ince was probably underrated – don’t write in – so maybe that bodes well …Even so, I did feel a tightening in my jaw when Andy informed the BBC this week that a tilt at the top job would need to be “more than a personality contest”. A personality contest between Keir Starmer andAndy Burnham? I guess we are where we are.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamOpinionLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

I needed to be convinced, so I put 14 bestsellers through their paces with my soggy washing to find out whether they’re the best thing in laundry since the clothes peg – or destined for the loft.At a glanceBest heated clothes airer overall:Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer and cover (cover currently out of stock)£169.99 at LakelandBest budget heated airer:Black+Decker heated winged clothes airer£45 at DunelmBest heated airer for fast drying:Minky SureDri heat pod drying system£90 at ArgosWhy you should trust meI’ve spent three decades testing products from Sky boxes to mattress toppers, and it’s made me professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically solve domestic problems. I also have a solid background in procrastinating by doing laundry, hanging laundry and folding laundry, so I couldn’t resist the Filter’s offer to pay me to watch clothes dry.View image in fullscreenWe tested the temperature of the heated clothes airers with an infrared thermometer.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianHow I testedHeated airers all do much the same thing in much the same way. There are small differences in design – some have triangle frames, some are winged and some have covers – but they’re basically all clothes horses that you plug in. I had to find clear distinctions between them, and this chiefly meant devising fair, quantifiable tests to measure how quickly, evenly and cheaply each airer dried clothes.The key test was a half-hourly laundry weigh-in to measure how quickly each airer dried an identical load. Actually, two identical loads – one small (4kg) and one big (8kg) – 14 times, once for every airer. I removed and weighed the clothes every 30 minutes to see how much moisture had evaporated until the fabric was dry, and this gave me an overall drying time. Room temperature remained at a steady 19-20C throughout. For more behind-the-scenes insights into weighing knickers, check outthe Filter’s newsletter.I took other measurements too, not least to give me something (anything) to do while the laundry dried, such as the dimensions of each airer and the length of its heated bars. I used an infrared thermometer to take the bars’ temperature every 30 seconds to compare heat-up times, and a wattage meter to check power usage. I then used the October 2025 default tariff (26.35p a kWh) to work out running costs an hour.Some brands didn’t want the airers I’d tested returned, so those were donated to two organisations that do important work in and around Southampton. The first isScratch, which provides services and furniture for families and individuals experiencing poverty, and the other isStop Domestic Abuse, a charity offering support for survivors of abuse and stalking.Here’s my guide to the nine best heated clothes airers based on my tests.The best heated clothes airers in2025View image in fullscreen‘The most efficient barred airer I tested’: the Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBest heated clothes airer overall:Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer and coverView image in fullscreenNote:the coverfor this airer is out of stock until 6 October. Both of the links below are for the airer alone£169.99 at Lakeland£169.99 at AmazonThis airer is for anyone who’s fed up with choosing between the expense of a noisy tumble dryer, the mess of clothes on radiators, and the rank stink of laundry slowly drying on a conventional clothes horse. With its ventilated heat-retaining cover in place, it’s the most efficient barred airer I tested.Why we love itLakeland’s Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer arrives ready to use. It took me only two minutes to unfold the tiers, position the cover, plug in the cable and switch it on. The airer is a handsome chrome rack on its own, but the light grey embroidered cover makes the whole thing look rather gorgeous.The bars warmed up faster than most of its rivals, reaching 27C within 30 seconds before maxing out at 50C. When I laid a 4kg load of damp T-shirts across them and closed the cover, the lot was dry in two hours. That’s no faster than a tumble dryer, but it’s much more energy-efficient, costing about 8p an hour compared with 79p for my tumble dryer.The Dry:Soon Deluxe has some excellent user-friendly details. In particular, a timer lets you set it to switch off in hourly increments up to 12 hours ahead, which is handy for leaving it on overnight without the risk of forgetting it in the morning. All Lakeland’s airers come with a three-year warranty compared with the basic statutory guarantees for most heated airers.It’s a shame that …this airer costs almost as much as a tumble dryer. Deluxe by name, deluxe by price. But it’s many times cheaper to run, and withenergy costs rising, £200+ may be worth spending to keep your bills down.Suitable for:families who want to give up their expensive tumble dryer habitAvailable drying space:21m (up to 36 hanging T-shirts)Dimensions (open):73 x 75 x 137cm (DWH)Dimensions (folded):10 x 75 x 137cm (DWH)Max capacity:15kgTime to dry small load:2 hoursRunning cost:8p/hourBest budget heated airer:Black+Decker heated winged clothes airerView image in fullscreen£45 at Dunelm£47.99 at AmazonThe Black+Decker doesn’t get particularly hot, which helps if you have curious toddlers and delicate clothes. It still managed to dry my small load of T-shirts in an afternoon, and at £45 with a 6p-an-hour running cost, it’s a decent budget buy. It’s also one of the easiest airers to fold down and slip under the sofa when not in use.Why we love itThe Black+Decker winged airer has the smallest footprint in my test, taking up about 50 x 50cm on its beam supports, yet it boasts a capacity of 10kg when unfolded, thanks to its ironing board-style shape. It warmed up to 33C in its hottest spots and dried my small load of T-shirts in just over four hours, with a little help from me flipping them and moving them around.I also like that the wings fold inwards to double up the heat when drying thicker garments, albeit not very large ones, and the dryer is so light (about 3.5kg) that I could move it around using one hand.It’s a shame that …it warmed up slowly and failed to get hotter than 33C even after three hours. That’s great for delicates and damp towels, but not hot enough to dry thick fabrics.Suitable for:drying light fabrics and warming up towelsAvailable drying space:11m (up to 20 hanging T-shirts)Dimensions (open):54 x 148 x 93cm (DWH)Dimensions (folded):approx 54 x 100 x 20cm (DWH)Max capacity:10kgTime to dry small load:4 hours 15 minutesRunning cost:6p/hourBest heated airer for fast drying:Minky SureDri heat pod drying systemView image in fullscreen£90 at Argos£89.99 at AmazonHeat pods turn your old unheated airer into a heated version. This one has a waterproof cover that fits a standard three-tier clothes horse, plus an electric heater that sits underneath to fill the space with hot air.Why we love itMinky’s pod system is a damp-blitzing machine. Even on its lowest 360W setting, it was one of the fastest dryers in my tests, because the heater and cover combo kept in the hot air. I measured the highest setting as using 915W, which cost 24p an hour, and it dried a large 8kg load within three hours. That’s as fast as a tumble dryer, but with less damage to your electric bill, or indeed to your clothes.At £90, the Minky isn’t quite a bargain buy, but I love that it brings hot new life to your existing clothes horse. If the cover doesn’t fit yours, you can use a sheet with the Minky heater unit to much the same effect.It’s a shame that …drying clothes with the Minky is more of a faff than with barred heated airers. First, you have to set up the pod, then you have to put up with the noise. The cover also makes it fiddly to check your clothes while they’re drying.Suitable for:work clothes and school uniforms that need a fast laundry turnaroundAvailable drying space:about 18m, depending on your clothes horseDimensions (heat pod unit):28 x 17 x 33cm (DWH)Max capacity:about 10kgTime to dry small load:1 hour 40 minutes (setting 1); 45mins (setting 3)Running cost:10p/hour (setting 1); 24p/hour (setting 3)The best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Ten T-shirts dried in two hours’: the Dunelm XL 3-tier square heated airer.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDunelm XL 3-tier square heated airerView image in fullscreen£125 at DunelmBest for:a never-ending cycle of laundry that needs constant accessThis huge, uncovered airer lets you get at your washing as it dries, so you can check, rearrange and replace items easily. It’s so big that I could lay an entire 4kg load of 10 T-shirts across the bars, and they dried in two hours at a cost of less than 20p. To save space, you can fold down half of the airer while it’s drying.It didn’t make the final cut because …this airer will be too big for many homes to accommodate.Available drying space:25m;dimensions (open):73 x 85 x 136cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):10 x 85 x 136cm (DWH);max capacity:25kg;time to dry small load:2 hours;running cost:9p/hourDunelm 3-tier A-frame heated airerView image in fullscreen£100 at DunelmBest for:runners and dog walkers who need to dry soggy shoes and socksHeated shoe stands are a simple addition and work well on this airer, drying my thick walking socks faster than if I’d laid them across the bars. The A-frame design also makes this among the sturdiest smaller airers I tested, and it stood firm even when I threw a large load of washing at the top tier.It didn’t make the final cut because …my small 4kg load needed an unusually long five hours, even after I’d moved things around and flipped them over. I also hated risking my fingers in the metal-hinged supports each time I folded and unfolded the airer.Available drying space:17m, including shoe stands;dimensions (open):54 x 91 x 146cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):18 x 91 x 146cm (DWH);max capacity:15kg;time to dry small load:4 hours;running cost:9p/hourskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The pivoted frame makes it feel less sturdy than airers with feet at each corner, but it’s a breeze to fold and unfold.It didn’t make the final cut because …the Argos Home airer feels less robust than similarly priced rivals.Available drying space:17m;dimensions (open):73 x 70 x 144cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):13 x 70 x 144cm (DWH);max capacity:15kg;time to dry small load:4 hours 20 minutes;running cost:9p/hourThe 8 best electric blankets and heated throws – tried and tested to keep you toasty for less this winterRead moreJML DriBuddi indoor clothes airerView image in fullscreen£59.99 at Robert Dyas£69.99 at AmazonBest for:drying shirts and dressesThe DriBuddi uses an electric heater to blast your clothes inside a tent-like structure, with hooks for clothes hangers rather than bars. Its highest power settings dried my clothes quickly and helped remove wrinkles, but it wasn’t as efficient as the Minky, perhaps because air circulates better when clothes are laid across tiered bars rather than hanging in a bundle.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s quite noisy, and there’s no way to lay items flat for drying. You can dismantle the heater stand if you want, but it doesn’t fold down in the way other airers do.Available drying space:holds up to 18 garments on hangers;dimensions:60 x 60 x 160cm (DWH);max capacity:10kg;time to dry small load:2 hours 20 minutes;running cost:31p/hourAldi Ambiano winged heated airerView image in fullscreen£34.99 at Aldi (in store only)Best for:small living spaces and limited budgetsAldi’s Ambiano-branded airer is the cheapest I tested and well worth a trip to the shops – but Aldi isn’t kidding with that “while stocks last” label. After waiting for a restock, I finally tested this bargain airer on the coldest days of January, and it performed almost as well as the more widely available Black+Decker winged airer. With the free cover in place and a bit of rearranging halfway through, it dried my small load in just over four hours. It’s a smart pick if you’re short on space because it folds down easily to merely 6cm high for slipping under a bed or chest of drawers when not in use.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not powerful enough to dry a full load on a cold day without resulting in stinky slow-dried clothes, as with the Black+Decker and Argos three-tier models here. However, it will dry a few items laid flat – especially if you fold in the wings to double up the heat.Available drying space:12m;dimensions (open):54 x 148 x 83cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):54 x 94 x 6cm (DWH);max capacity:10kg;time to dry small load:4 hours 15 minutes;running cost:8p/hourGlamHaus digital electric clothes airerView image in fullscreen£136.99 at Robert Dyas£140.45 at AmazonBest for:sizeable wardrobes that contain delicate fabricsThis is one of the biggest and most feature-rich airers I tested, with a ventilated cover, timer and digital temperature controls that I found fairly easy to use. The top setting reached nowhere near the claimed 70C but did manage 52C in places, and I love having the lower-temperature settings for drying flimsy fabrics on the bars. You can attach peg hangers to dangle your smalls in the heat, but they don’t allow much dangle room. As with all the airers I tested, you get a much quicker dry if you lay items across the bars.It didn’t make the final cut because …it doesn’t dry clothes quite as fast as the Dry:Soon Deluxe, and it’s a right old jigsaw to put together the first time you use it. After that, though, I found it easy to open and close.Available drying space:30m;dimensions (open):73 x 70 x 147cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):15 x 70 x 147cm (DWH);max capacity:25kg;time to dry small load:3 hours 30 minutes;running cost:9p/hourWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianHeated clothes airers are such a simple and smart idea that it’s weird they haven’t been around longer. They’re wildly popular, too: I waited four months to testAldi’s winged heated airerbecause there were none left in the warehouse within days of it going on sale last September. But do they deserve the hype – and how can you get the best out of yours?How much do heated airers cost to run?Minimal running cost is the biggest selling point of heated airers. Their packaging bears promises that they’ll dry your clothes for as little as 6p an hour, dramatically undercutting all rival methods other than blazing sunshine. Really? Yes, in some cases, at least until jumps in energy prices piled on the pennies.Even under energy prices of autumn 2024, when I first tested most of these airers, 6p an hour was a little optimistic. I found that standard barred airers, running at about 320W, worked out at 7p an hour in September 2024 and 8p an hour now.Most heated airers take a full afternoon or more to dry a load of washing, and those 8p hours will add up. Airers that dry clothes faster, such as the fan-heater-based Minky SureDri and JML DriBuddi, cost more to run. At 1,200W, the DriBuddi now costs about 31p an hour, adding up to more than 60p to dry a load.That’s still significantly cheaper than running a tumble dryer or, indeed, a washing machine. Under October 2025 energy prices, a tumble dryer running at 3kW costs 79p an hour to run, and it can cost even more to switch on the central heating.Can you leave them on all night?An hour or two on a heated airer won’t make a dent in the dampness of your jumpers or thick towels. Overnight would do it – but is it safe? The good news is that a 300W airer uses about the same amount of electricity as a fridge freezer, so yes, you can leave your clothes to dry while you snooze. Gentle warmth in the room is a lovely bonus.But while barred airers are safe to leave on overnight, as confirmed by brands including John Lewis, Lakeland and retailer Direct365, be more cautious with the fan heater type. The 1,200W JML packs about half the wattage (and noise) of a tumble dryer, and I certainly wouldn’t leave one of those on overnight or while I’m out.How can you make clothes dry faster on a heated airer?There are ways you can speed up the drying process. My best tip is to ignore the marketing photos that show airers draped like Christmas trees, with clothes hung from every bar. As I discovered while running this test, your clothes simply won’t dry that way unless it’s a warm day, which rather defeats the point. Instead, lay individual items across the bars.Covered airers cut drying times by almost half, but you can achieve a similar result by throwing a fitted sheet over the top, as long as there’s a gap for moist air to escape. Whatever cover you use, I’d recommend removing it as soon as your clothes are dry. Covers are vented to avoid condensation, but I found that some moisture crept back in if I left my clothes inside.However powerful your airer, always spin your clothes to remove as much water as possible before laying them on it. Wet clothes won’t dry, and water and electricity are not a happy combination.On that note, don’t use a heated airer in the bathroom. Electric peril aside, bathroom air is notoriously damp. I had the best results when using my test airers in the bedroom with the window ajar – and the faint fabric softener scent was a sweet bedtime bonus.Do heated airers make your house damp?When you dry clothes on any warm surface, whether it’s a heated airer or a radiator, the moisture rises from the clothes – to where? I asked a range of experts about this, and they broadly agreed that the key is to let the moist air escape from your home.“It’s not the drying method alone but the combination of moisture and lack of ventilation that leads to damp problems,” says Dr Anastasia Mylona, technical director at the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. “You can manage this by ensuring good ventilation when drying clothes indoors; for example, by opening windows or using extractor fans.”A dehumidifier can help avoid damp, as well as speed up the drying process, says cleaning expert Nancy Emery of bathroom retailerDrench. “If you’re investing in a heated airer, my advice is to invest in a dehumidifier as well, and always run them together.”I’ve found heated airers much less likely than radiators to cause damp walls, and property expert Phil Spencer explains why. “Airflow is key, so if you want to use a heated airer, put it in the middle of the room rather than next to the wall,” says Spencer, who, among other things, has founded the property advice websiteMove iQ. “This is why heated airers are preferable to wall-mounted radiators.”However, radiators can heat up the room, and heated airers can’t, at least not significantly. That’s an important factor in the battle against damp, says Emery. “Maintaining your home’s temperature above 18C helps because condensation can’t settle on warmer surfaces.”I put these tips to the test usingan affordable humidity meter. I measured the moisture in my spare room’s air before doing any laundry, and then again at various stages of drying a medium load on a large heated airer – with and without opening the windows and using a dehumidifier.It had rained all week, so perhaps it’s no surprise that my house boasted a base humidity level of 70%, 10% higher than the recommended UK maximum. Iwassurprised, though, when this only rose to 72% once I’d loaded the airer with damp clothes. Running my dehumidifier brought the room’s humidity down to 70%. When I opened the windows, it dropped to 65% – even before the load was completely dry. I’ve now defaulted to leaving the windows open whenever possible, whether or not I’m drying clothes.“Opening windows regularly is the best way to allow humid air to escape, though it may seem counterintuitive in colder weather,” says Nicholas Donnithorne, UK technical services manager at Rentokil Property Care. “Leave quarterlights ajar or trickle vents open. Dehumidifiers can help, but they require regular emptying and aren’t a substitute for proper ventilation.”For more autumn and winter home essentials, read the Filter’s guides to:The best electric blankets and heated throwsThe best electric heaters, testedJane Hoskyn is afeatures journalist and WFH pioneer with three decadesof experiencein rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

More than 50 years on, the tables have been turned, with former pupils taking it in turns to wake the three remaining nuns at the convent. “Sister Bernadette in particular likes a lie-in,” said Christina Wirtenberger, one of their carers.Sisters Bernadette, 88, Regina, 86, and Rita, almost 82, are still recovering from the shock of having run away on 4 September from a nearby retirement home where they had been placed – they say against their will – and broken back into their former convent, the imposing Schloss Goldenstein, in Elsbethen, just outside Salzburg.The nuns’ superior since 2022, Provost Markus Grasl, from nearby Reichersberg Abbey, has accused them of “breaking the vow of obedience” they made when they entered the order, byillegally occupying their castle home, and says they are living in “conditions too precarious” for their advanced ages. Removing them from the convent and placing them in more suitable accommodation, he says, was a necessary act of care and had been negotiated with the sisters in advance.View image in fullscreenChristina Wirtenberger, a former student, helped the sisters with their return plan and now assists them almost daily.But the nuns dispute this and are sticking to their guns, building up an international fanclub as they do so. More than 50,000 people are now following them onsocial media, with followers given a stream of daily insights into the lives of the octogenarian religious rebels.Wirtenberger, a retired advertising director nicknamed ‘Oki’, who started boarding at the school in 1970 as a 10-year-old, was at the helm of the action to rescue the nuns. When the three were placed in a care home in late 2023, they were promised it was only for a short term stay, she said. “When they were still there nearly two years later, and all of them so unhappy, our anger spurred us into action.”With the help of a lawyer, locals, and accompanied by a handful of journalists, all of whom promised to keep the operation secret, the nuns were whisked from the care home and smuggled back into their cloister.A locksmith was on hand to help them in, as well as an electrician and plumber who reconnected the convent to the mains.View image in fullscreenSister Rita, known for her effervescence and for tending the garden, settled permanently at the convent in 1969.View image in fullscreenRita is devastated by the garden’s current state, with nothing left alive in the greenhouses.Until their removal, Regina, known affectionately by her pupils as ‘Regi’, had been at the convent since 1959, and was also the headmistress. She taught six subjects and kept the books. Rita (‘Ritsch’), known for her effervescence and for tending the garden, initially came and went, returning permanently in 1969. Bernadette, (‘Berna’) known as the strictest, had been there the longest, for more than seven decades, first as a pupil herself, later as a teacher, whose domestic tasks included cooking and sewing.When they joined their convent, established here almost 150 years ago, there were about 30 nuns. With no new recruits, though, the numbers dwindled, and for the past two decades, Bernadette, Rita and Regina were the only ones remaining. They believed they would be able to do so until the end of their lives.“We had been told we had the right to stay in the convent until we died, according to the law and a contract we signed,” Sister Bernadette said. “Could we have thought we would be betrayed like this? Never. We were obedient our entire lives, but we could not bear to be away from our home which is why we came back.”Stabilitas lociis the vow of permanence a person entering a holy order is expected to make, expressing not just a commitment to the physical location, but also lifelong spiritual dedication to the order and community. “But it cuts both ways,” Sister Regina said, pointedly.View image in fullscreenCastle Goldenstein in Elsbethen, Salzburg.They say that when they left the convent in 2023, having no idea they were not meant to return, they left most of their possessions behind. On returning after 20 months, they suspected the convent had been ransacked in their absence.Among the missing items, they say, was the stair lift which had helped them reach their fourth floor living quarters.Gone too were their recipe books, photo albums, teaching notes, orthopaedic shoes, birth and school certificates – not to mention letters and photographs from former pupils, including from the film actor Romy Schneider, who attended between 1949 and 1953. A classmate of Bernadette’s, her acting talent was nurtured by an attentive drama teacher, Sister Augustine.A plastic bag of money kept in a wardrobe, which the nuns say they used for incidentals, has also gone, the nuns say. The bank accounts to which they once had access as a community, into which their wages had been paid, as well as Bernadette’s inheritance from her mother, are no longer accessible, they add.The money, they and their supporters argue, could be used to pay for round-the-clock care in the convent.The nuns’ future is unknown, even as they repeat the prayerful invocation they say has given them strength: “We are in God’s hands”. They have a network of about 200 helpers, from those providing a security detail, to others who cook their meals, as well as voluntary doctors and nurses who are offering regular medical care.Absent as yet is a network of priests – the only volunteer is a retired 94-year-old – who could come and say regular mass, fulfilling what they say is their most urgent need: the re-establishment of a regular spiritual life. Most clergy “are too scared to stick their necks above the pulpit, lest they get into trouble with the church”, says one organiser who does not wish to be named.Among the well-wishers was the US folk singer Elisabeth von Trapp, granddaughter of Salzburg’s most famous daughter Maria von Trapp, herself an erstwhile novice, whose story inspired The Sound of Music. “She brought roses and told us to stay brave,” said Rita.With such attention on them, sheadded, they remained cautiously optimistic that Pope Leo, a fellow Augustinian, might be prepared to intervene. “He is in our prayers, at least,” Rita said.View image in fullscreenThe sisters invite everyone to pray the rosary together in their chapel.Grasl has not responded to the nuns’ accusations in public but appointed a PR crisis manager to deal with what has quickly turned into a public relations disaster for the Catholic church inAustria. A spokesperson, Harald Schiffl, said the church had “spent years negotiating with the nuns about the terms of their departure”, before signing a contract with them.He rejected the nuns’ claims that they had been tricked into signing anything against their will, arguing that it became clear in 2023 that conditions at the cloister were “too precarious” for the nuns to remain there.View image in fullscreenSister Rita in her room in the monastery.“It is understandable that it is very, very difficult for the sisters. But sometimes in old age, one has to act out of charity and responsibility and make certain decisions on others’ behalf,” he said.He denied that possessions had been removed, saying the rooms had “only been cleared of spoiled food and rubbish.” The nuns “should have no private possessions in that sense anyway, according to their vows. Anything they have belongs to the community,” he said, including the bank accounts, adding: “The provost is by decree responsible for the entire cloister property including all the finances.”As Sister Rita took the Guardian around the local graveyard where nuns from the order have been buried since the 1880s, she bemoaned the removal of the flower beds that once lined the plots, which the trio had habitually tended. “I suppose they wanted to more easily be able to mow the grass,” she said. “But it’s as if they’re trying to erase all trace of us”.Explore more on these topicsAustriaCatholicismChristianityEuropeReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is an enemy. There is a project which is detrimental to our country. It actually goes against the grain of our history. It’s right there in plain sight in front of us. We have to win this battle.”While Starmer’s focus will be on setting out his own vision for renewing the country, he will also urge Labour not to be distracted by speculation over his grip on power.Burnham – who would need a Westminster seat – is seen by a number of Labour MPs as someone who could provide a more robust challenge to Reform, as well as a change in economic strategy.With Starmer’s premiership under scrutiny, Burnhamsaid this week he had been privately encouragedto challenge the prime minister.But Starmer said he was determined to reclaim patriotism from Reform and renew the country.He also insisted he would remain in office and lead Labour into the next election. “Yes, and it will be an election about this very argument,” he said.“I will also be saying to the party, this is no time for introspection. You know what conference is like, thousands of people, there’s great energy, and there’s always the usual jostling for who’s up, who’s down, all the rest of it. This is much bigger than that. This goes to the heart of who we are as a country.“We do not have time for introspection. We have to unite and fight ... we cannot miss this opportunity to set out our stall and take the fight to Reform.”Starmer said he would “confront Reform, not ape Reform”, after concerns inside his party that Downing Street was pitching to the right on issues including immigration to challenge Nigel Farage.He singled out the Reform leader’sattack on the scientific establishmentthis week, during which Farage said he would never “side with” medical experts, as an example of why the government had to defend key institutions.“Yes, we do have to, and it’s really important, because once we lose the anchor of thinking that truth matters we are on a very, very slippery slope. What Nigel Farage has said about science recently needs to be absolutely shown to be what it is, which is lies feeding off a sense of disaffection.”He also criticised Jeremy Corbyn, his leftwing predecessor as leader who he ousted from the party, claiming the veteran MP would “not get behind the fight, because he’s into the politics of grievance on the left” as much as Farage was on the right.With the budget looming large over the party conference, and tax rises looking ever more likely, Starmer admitted it was going to take time to turn the economy around. “There are no easy decisions. But we mustn’t move away from our fiscal rules,” he said, a direct retort to those advocating more borrowing.“Three years ago this week, Liz Truss tried an experiment of moving away from fiscal rules – in her case to do tax cuts. We all know what the result of that was. The same will be true for spending and borrowing outside the fiscal rules. So we have to be really clear about that.”He did not rule out increasing taxes but said the government would “set out our case” for any changes at the budget. The Treasury is expected to receive figures from the budget watchdog next week.However, he gave his clearest indication yet that he was planning to lift the two-child benefit cap. “We’re going to bring down child poverty. That is the clear intent of this government. It’s my clear personal intent. I’m very proud that the last Labour government did so obviously, we’ve got a taskforce which will report, but we will be taking measures to bring down child poverty.”The prime minister threw his weight behind his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who has faced intense criticism from within the Labour party, as well as attacks from the Conservatives. “Of course. But next week is not about who’s up, who’s down, who’s saying this about somebody else,” Starmer said.The Electoral Commission said on Friday McSweeneywould not face another investigationinto undeclared donations to the Labour Together thinktank after it found “no evidence” of any other potential offences.At a progressive governance conference in London on Friday, Rachel Reeves also underlined the economic challenge ahead. “I’m chancellor in the world that we are in, not in the world that we may wish it to be,” she said.“In those tough times, it’s even more important that we have somebody who’s got a grip, has a plan, knows what they’re doing, and is not willing to be dragged off course by every siren call.”At the same event, Starmerconfirmed that a new digital ID cardwould be introduced by 2029 that would be mandatory for people working in the UK. Darren Jones, spearheading the policy in No 10, said it could form “the bedrock of the modern state”, an indication that it could have much wider uses in future, perhaps including the benefits system.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourReform UKLabour conferenceAndy BurnhamFar rightnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s insane, and we won’t do it.”“Giving the Palestinians a state one mile from Jerusalem after October 7 is like giving al-Qaeda a state one mile fromNew YorkCity after September 11,” he said. Now 157 of 193 UN member states recognise Palestine as an independent state.More than 100 diplomats from more than 50 countries walked out as Netanyahu entered the hall, according to a tally by the Washington Post.Several demonstrators arrested outside Netanyahu’s hotel ahead of UN speechRead moreNetanyahu gave the speech the morning afterDonald Trumpsaid he wouldrestrain Netanyahufrom annexing territories in the West Bank in retaliation for the expressions of support for Palestinian statehood. “I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank ... It’s not going to happen,” Trump said.Rightwing allies of Netanyahu have proposed annexing up to 82% of the West Bank, which is formally governed by the Palestinian Authority. UK officials said that they were concerned the US could endorse the move.But Netanyahu did not address the controversial plan on Friday, and his office has said he would only respond after the two meet on Monday at the White House. Targeting the UK, France and other countries that recognised Palestine, he said: “You didn’t do something right. You did something wrong, horribly wrong.”“Your disgraceful decision will encourage terrorism against Jews and against innocent people everywhere,” he said.More than 22 people were killed inGazaon Friday ahead of Netanyahu’s speech, AFP reported, citing the civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas authority. Al Jazeera reported that as many as 47 Palestinians had been killed since dawn, including eight in a strike on a tent camp for displaced people in central Gaza’s Nuseirat camp.In the speech, Netanyahu vowed to continue an offensive targeting Gaza City, ignoring international condemnation that it would worsen a humanitarian crisis in Gaza that prosecutors from the international criminal court have condemned as a war crime.“The final remnants of Hamas are holed up in Gaza City,” he said, andIsrael“must finish the job” to avoid facing attacks like those on 7 October “again and again and again”.“That is why we want to do so as fast as possible.”Netanyahu used his speech at the 80th anniversary of theUnited Nationsgeneral assembly to deny that Israel was carrying out a genocide in Gaza, saying: “Would a country committing genocide plead with the civilian population it is supposedly targeting to get out of harm’s way?”The speech was highly contentious and delivered to a mostly empty room in the general assembly’s grand hall, which has capacity for 1,800 people. Reports said that delegations for the United States and United Kingdom, which remained in attendance, were filled out with junior diplomats as opposed to senior officials.But Netanyahu claimed foreign leaders who “public condemn us privately thank us. They tell me how much they value Israel’s superb intelligence services that have prevented, time and again, terrorist attacks in their capitals.” He did not say which countries’ leaders had privately thanked him.Thousands protested the speech on the streets of New York City, including at a main rally at Times Square across midtown.Is Trump’s new Palestine plan a breakthrough or diplomatic mirage?Read moreNetanyahu also issued an ultimatum to the remaining leaders of Hamas, whose ranks have been decimated in the nearly two years since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following the violent raids by Hamas in Israel on 7 October 2023.“Lay down your arms,” he said. “Let my people go. Free the hostages. All of them. The whole 48. Free the hostages now.”“If you do, you will live. If you don’t, Israel will hunt you down,” he added.The speech was marked with props and publicity ploys. It was broadcast on loudspeakers in Gaza, and Netanyahu’s office claimed it was also transmitted on telephones in the territory that had been hijacked by the Israeli intelligence services. Associated Press reporters inside Gaza said they saw no sign that the speech was broadcast on phones there.Netanyahu also used visual props, including a QR code that he encouraged viewers to scan: it linked to footage of the 7 October attacks by Hamas.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warUnited NationsNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

Although the school removed the book from its year 10 reading list after the complaint, it is still accessible to older pupils.In a letter to the school, which Farquharson posted on Facebook, he said: “You are teaching my daughters that their inherited skin colour makes then baddies. That is racism. By extension, you are also casting their country as a baddie. That is damaging to their self-esteem and the functioning of society.“You should not be surreptitiously teaching this new form of Marxism to my children, hidden as it is within a work of fiction. If you want to expose them to that ideology, by law, you should be clear what it is and give fair treatment and equal prominence to its counter-arguments.”A spokesperson for Budmouth Academy said: “We acknowledge that the novel raises important themes and is promoted as appropriate for readers that are aged 14+. However, after careful consideration, we have decided that there are alternative texts that raise similar themes which are better suited to our students in year 10.”Banned! The 20 books they didn’t want you to readRead moreA second book,Pigeon Englishby Stephen Kelman, is under review after Farquharson complained that it explores sexual themes including female masturbation and was so “creepy” it raised safeguarding concerns. It is likely to remain on the curriculum as it is a prescribed text for GCSE English literature.While Farquharson appears to be the sole parent who has publicly complained about the book, hundreds of students who recently left the school and parents have signed a Change.org petition calling for the book to be reinstated to classrooms. It highlights broader concerns about the implications of book banning.Vicky McNab, a parent of four mixed-heritage children, two of whom attend the school and two who have left, started the petition. It says books like this one help students “develop empathy, critical thinking and an understanding of experiences beyond their own”. It adds: “Removing it from classroom reading denies young people the opportunity to engage with important issues that shape the world around them.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Susannah Ireland/Rex Features“This decision does not only silence one book – it silences the voices and lived realities of minority communities. It sends a harmful message: that when these stories make others uncomfortable, they can be erased.”McNab’s daughter Marli, who left the school in July and is now at college, said she had always felt well supported at the school. “That’s why it’s sad that the school have been pushed into a corner and now this whole thing feels like a step back, because it doesn’t match the inclusive values I felt when I was a student,” she said.“When I heard The Hate U Give was taken off the list, I felt really disappointed. It’s such an important book because it gets people talking about real issues in a safe way. People have said they feel let down.“The bigger problem is that it feels like one parent’s complaint has decided it for everyone, which isn’t fair. We should be trusted to handle these conversations.

On one occasion she kicked a little boy in the face several times and stepped on his shoulder.Looking directly at the abuser, one mother said she had preyed on “innocent and vulnerable” children. “They couldn’t speak, they couldn’t defend themselves and they couldn’t tell us as parents that something had happened to them,” she said. “They were totally helpless and Roksana preyed upon them.”A different mother said that some of the CCTV showed babies reaching back out to Lecka after she had hurt them. “It is objectively shocking that she has been hiding in plain sight in society up until she was arrested,” she said. “I think all of us can agree that only the worst kind of human would assault vulnerable babies.”One father told the court that he and his wife believed that if Lecka had not been caught “she could have gone on to seriously injure or even kill”.Lecka’s crimes were discovered in June last year after she was sent home for pinching a number of children and appearing “flustered” at the Montessori Riverside Nursery in Twickenham, south-westLondon, according to the Crown Prosecution Service.Metropolitan police detectives went through CCTV from the nursery that showed her pinching and scratching children, all aged 18 months to two years, under their clothes on their arms, legs and stomachs, sometimes dozens of times a day. She was also seen pushing babies headfirst over cots and on one occasion covered a toddler’s mouth when he started to cry.There were gasps from jurors and weeping parents in the public gallery as footage of Lecka’s abuse of toddlers was shown during her trial. Judge Plaschkes KC exempted the jury from future service for the next 10 years.Plaschkes said Lecka had committed acts of “gratuitous violence”, adding: “You pinched, slapped, punched, smacked and kicked them. You pulled their ears, hair and their toes. You toppled children headfirst into cots. You caused bruising and lingering red marks.“Often the child would be quietly and happily minding its own business before you deliberately inflicted pain … Your criminal conduct can properly be characterised as sadistic.”Lecka told police she smoked cannabis before her shifts, and at one point was seen vaping a metre away from a young baby.The Met said she had abused children at two nurseries between October 2023 and June 2024 – all but one of the counts related to Riverside in Twickenham, which has since closed, with one related to Little Munchkins in Hounslow. Lecka worked at Riverside Nursery between January and June 2024, with a number of parents reporting unusual injuries and bruising in March and May that year. Lecka was suspended on 28 June 2024.During the trial, Lecka said she would get moody if she could not smoke her vape at work and said that during the week of her suspension she had been “over-prioritising” her boyfriend. “I was with my boyfriend every night. I was addicted to him,” she said.Lecka had denied assaulting any children at the Riverside Nursery, but changed several pleas to guilty just before her trial began, having been shown enhanced CCTV of her crimes.When asked in court if she had lied, she said: “I was not lying because I was unaware of what I was doing and the things I was doing, I can’t remember the things I was doing because I was smoking cannabis that was affecting my memory.”DI Sian Hutchings said: “These families left their children in Lecka’s care, trusting her to protect their children as well as the other staff at the nurseries clearly did. The footage of her offences against defenceless children was disturbing. I would like to praise the strength of the victims’ families who have had to sit in court and watch footage of the abuse which Lecka inflicted on their children.”The senior crown prosecutor Gemma Burns said: “Lecka repeatedly showed exceptional cruelty in her appalling treatment of these babies. No parent should have to fear leaving their child in the care of professionals, but the sheer scale of her abuse is staggering.“The CPS put forward compelling evidence that clearly showed her targeting children when colleagues were either out of the room, or had their backs turned. We also called on experts to prove that the injuries Lecka’s victims sustained were consistent with pinch marks.“Lecka was placed in a position of trust and her job required her to provide safety and protection. Instead, she kicked, scratched and pinched these young children, with this vile abuse of vulnerable victims continuing for many months.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsLondonChildrenChild protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

Legal observers and lawmakers see something far more troubling.A former Republican appointed to lead the bureau by Barack Obama and kept on by Trump until he fired him in 2017, Comey wasindicted Thursdayon charges related to allegedly lying to Congress five years ago during a hearing on the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.The charges were filed in the eastern district of Virginia only after Erik Siebert wasforced outas US attorney for reportedly finding no grounds to indict Comey. The justice department replaced him with a Trump loyalist with little prosecutorial experience, Lindsey Halligan, and shortly after, a grand jury indicted Comey on one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of acongressional proceeding.The indictment is the latest sign that the president is making good on his promise “to turn our justice system into a weapon for punishing and silencing his critics”, said Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee.“This kind of interference is a dangerous abuse of power. Our system depends on prosecutors making decisions based on evidence and the law, not on the personal grudges of a politician determined to settle scores,” Warner said.Adam Schiff, the Democratic senator and a former federal prosecutor who played a lead role in Trump’s first impeachment,said on Xhe had “never witnessed such a blatant abuse of the” justice department, calling it “little more than an arm of the president’s retribution campaign”.In a letter to Pam Bondi, the attorney general,Democratson the Senate judiciary committee described Siebert’s firing and Comey’s indictment as “the latest steps in President Trump’s efforts to reshape the nation’s leading law enforcement agency into a weapon focused on punishing his enemies”.Top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries said it was “crazy to me” that Trump was pursuing a “malicious prosecution” against Comey, given that the FBI chief’spublic revival of an investigationinto Hillary Clinton’s email use days before the 2016 election is seen as playing a role in Trump’s victory.“These charges are going to be dismissed.James Comeywill win in court. But what it reflects is a broader attack on the rule of law that should frighten every single American, whether you’re a Democrat, an independent or a Republican,” he said at the Capitol.Mike Zamore, national director of policy and government affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union, said Trump “has yet again proven his disdain for the principles that have actually made America great”.“By undermining the rule of law at each and every turn, threatening individuals who speak out against him, and arresting, investigating, and prosecuting elected officials of the opposition party and others who displease him, the president and his administration have corrupted our system of justice to turn his campaign of retribution into reality,” he said, adding that Trump’s public push to indict Comey amounts to “a grotesque abuse of presidential power”.Eric Swalwell, the Democratic congressman and member of the House judiciary committee, told CNN: “I promise you, when Democrats are in the majority, we are going to look at all of this, and there will be accountability, and bar licenses will be at stake in your local jurisdiction if you are corruptly indicting people where you cannot prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt on.”Norm Eisen, executive chair of pro-democracy group Democracy Defenders Fund, warned the indictment puts “the safety of every American and our national security itself in danger. This indictment has all the hallmarks of a vindictive and meritless prosecution, worthy only of the totalitarian states the United States used to oppose”.“This matters far beyond James Comey. It’s about every citizen’s right to live free from persecution by their own leaders. Criticizing our leaders is a fundamental right, regardless of how much our leaders don’t like it,” he said.Trump has spent the hours since Comey’s indictment was announced insulting him on Truth Social, calling him “One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to” onThursday nightand “A DIRTY COP” onFriday morning.His allies have taken up his argument, if not his tone.“Comey demonstrated complete arrogance and unwillingness to comply with the law,” said Ted Cruz, the Republican senator whose exchange with the former FBI director at a 2020 hearing is the subject of the allegations.Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the Senate judiciary committee, said: “If the facts and the evidence support the finding that Comey lied to Congress and obstructed our work, he ought to be held accountable.”“Say it with me, Democrats: nobody is above the law,” said Mike Davis, a prominent Trump legal defender, echoing a phrase often used by Democrats when Trump and his allies were facing prosecutions before his election victory last year.“We are just getting started today with this indictment,” Davis said. “It’s going to get much worse for the Democrats.”Explore more on these topicsJames ComeyDonald TrumpUS justice systemUS politicsDemocratsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

And I emptied it into the tank, and cooled it down to the proper temperature.”The lobster was released into the open waters of the Long Island Sound on Wednesday, just a day before National Lobster Day, which marks the peak of the annual US lobster harvesting season.Amid seasonal special offers from eateries, thousands more lobsters than usual suffered a different fate from their wild orange cousin and ended up boiled, buttered, and eaten.In 2021 an orange lobsterwas rescuedin Ontario by a Canadian couple, after being held captive in a grocery store tank, where it had languished for weeks after being shunned by shoppers because of its rare hue and was apparently being picked on by the other lobsters. That one ended up in an aquarium.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

AcrossEurope, physical identity cards have existed for decades, and digital versions have either already been successfully launched or are being trialled.In all bar two of the EU’s 27 member states, physicalID cards, in a standard, machine-readable EU format introduced in 2021, are used both as identity documents in citizens’ home countries, and for travel within the passport-free Schengen zone.In 15 countries they are compulsory: you must have one, although you are not necessarily obliged to have it with you. In another 11, they are voluntary: other forms of photo ID, such as driving licences, are accepted as identification.The size of a credit card, they display the holder’s name, address, nationality, date and place of birth, sex and height, as well as a photo and the card’s issue and expiry dates. A secure chip also stores data including the photo and fingerprints.The two exceptions are Denmark, which issues physical ID cards locally, and Ireland – but along with all other EU member states, both those countries have already either launched, or are developing, a form of digital ID wallet, and Ireland has already issued passport cards.Keir Starmer says digital ID cards an ‘enormous opportunity’ for the UKRead moreThe EU’s eIDAS 2.0 regulation will require every citizen of the bloc to be offered at least one digital ID wallet, allowing them to prove who they are and to safely store, share and sign important digital documents – such as their digital ID, birth certificate, passport, student card, qualifications, driver’s licence and tax details – by 2026.Some countries have gone further, faster. In Denmark, life online is almost impossible without MitID, a digital identity app for smartphones or tablets introduced in 2023 as a public-private partnership between banks, insurers and the digitisation ministry.You need it log into banking websites, sign up for the main payment system, shop online, access the government information and services portal, deal with your taxes, make a health appointment or view your pension online and apply for a college course.Estonians, likewise, use their almost 20-year-old e-ID (also available, if much less commonly, in card form), to vote, digitally sign documents and access public services from healthcare to education, as well as for banking and online shopping.Countries with well-developed digital identities – including war-torn Ukraine, where theDiia appallows people to store 14 important digital documentsand access 21 services – argue that they modernise and streamline public services. Estonia claims e-ID saves citizens about five days a year of pre-digital administrative hassle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They can report lost documents and verify someone else’s ID by scanning a QR code in the app.A recently added tool also allows drivers to notify insurers of a collision, confirming their ID and submitting evidence, and this month student IDs for high school pupils were added so they can use the app to get discounts on public transport and museums.The app also guides users on how to take a photo for their documents, without having to go to a professional photographer or booth.

America and its military can not run without steel and computer chips. The nation’s food and drug supply must be protected. But have you considered the security implications of your kitchen sink?Announcing his latest wave of tariffs on goods from overseas – a 50% levy on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 30% on upholstered furniture, to be enforced next month – Trump once again cited the top priority of any president.On his social media platform, Trump alleged that foreign firms are “FLOODING” the US with such products, and added: “It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process.”Experts are scratching their heads.“It is difficult to see how some of the products subject to tariffs have anything to do with national security, even broadly defined,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, and a former official at the International Monetary Fund.And while the president has presented these latest tariffs as a defense of US industry, the US industry in question is not immediately celebrating news of these incoming protections.The National Kitchen and Bath Association represents US designers, builders, remodelers, manufacturers, dealers, and retailers. Bill Darcy, its global president and CEO, said the sector was “carefully reviewing the implications” of the tariffs, vowing to “continue to support and identify areas for continued success with our manufacturing partners… across the globe”.The cabinets, vanities and furniture tariffs are set to be imposed under section 232, a provision of a national security law, through which the president can order an investigation and ultimately impose tariffs – bypassing Congress, despite its constitutional authority – if certain imports are deemed to threaten national security.The Trump administration has already used section 232 to impose tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and cars. This latest announcement, focused largely on furniture, is a fresh test of just how far “national security” grounds can be stretched to enact the president’s tariff agenda.A White House official told the Guardian that an upcoming report into the findings of the section 232 investigation would explain exactly how foreign kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture pose a threat to US national security.The administration is alreadyfighting one significant legal battleover its contested use of legislation – the International Emergency Economic Powers Act – to impose tariffs. And with section 232, many of those closely following its rationale are increasingly dubious.“This justification for imposing tariffs through executive actions while sidelining the US Congress is wearing increasingly thin,” said Prasad. “All told, such peremptory actions are fomenting enormous uncertainty and volatility in the trade landscape and will ultimately hurt rather than help US consumers and businesses.”Explore more on these topicsTariffsUS economyTrump tariffsEconomicsDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

Schoolchildren on an evacuation flight from a UK under nuclear attack are stranded by an air crash on a desert island where, granted a second chance at civilisation, they build one just as brutal and ruinous as the one they lost.Golding’s gloom was driven by the Holocaust and the start of a cold war, and a reasonable reading of the book is that he might have been surprised that civilisation still exists seven decades later. Even so, his bleak vision feels justified by jumpy governments, and military and social divisions. Piggy, the most humane student, believes that everything can be resolved with “meetings” – Golding’s code for diplomacy and voting. That plea now feels more futile than ever.Although this bleak scenario applies globally, Anthony Lau’s revival of an adaptation by Nigel Williams – written for schools in 1991 and premiered professionally by the RSC four years later – reflects Golding’s note to Williams that Lord of the Flies reflected “the breakdown of English parliamentary democracy”. Loz Tait’s costumes are recognisable as public school blazers, with Piggy’s casuals suggesting state school.View image in fullscreenNo insults spared … Lord of the Flies.Photograph: Manuel HarlanThe castaways expire or bring out their worst on a largely bare stage (designed by Georgia Lowe) littered with large flight cases that become multiple things. An island pig – the plot’s key prop – is represented by a plastic mask and a piñata. A hyper-busy production throws everything at the show: smoke, shock lighting changes (by Matt Daw) and litres of stage gore, the full interval needed to wipe down the stage for the second half.Alfie Jallow’s Piggy starts by reading out a trigger warning but, sensibly, given the story’s theme of cruelty, is spared none of the physical insults that a modern sensitivity reader might remove. Jallow wins the audience’s sympathy with intelligence and dignity, while professional debutant Sheyi Cole is commanding and charming as Ralph, in a sparky young cast.It’s unusual to use a three decade old literary adaptation because context changes how we see a novel. (A newBBC TV versionis planned.) When book and play first appeared, their suggestion of an innate arc towards violent self-destruction was striking enough. Now that such moral entropy is a working daily assumption, it might be time for a version in which Piggy and Ralph are given bigger rhetorical weapons against the depravity of their peers.AtChichester Festival theatreuntil 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreWilliam GoldingChichester Festival theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement shocked health experts because the FDA’s usual approval process, which is lengthy and rigorous, has been bypassed.Leucovorin, also known as folinic acid, is a derivative of vitamin B. It is typically used to counteract the harmful effects of methotrexate, a common chemotherapy drug. In astatement, the FDA commissioner, Martin Makary, said the drug would now be approved for patients with cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), a condition sometimes associated with autism spectrum disorders.While a small number of studies have shown some improvement in children with autism who were treated with leucovorin, many autism researchers and advocates argue the announcement is premature and more research is needed.“Current studies on high-dose leucovorin are very preliminary,” says Danielle Hall, director of health equity at the Autism Society of America. Premature claims about its efficacy could lead to “false hope” and “misinterpretation that leucovorin represents a ‘cure’,” she warns.Here’s what you need to know about leucovorin.What is leucovorin?Leucovorin is “very similar to folic acid”, says Dr David Mandell, professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. The difference is that leucovorin has been “altered in a way that makes it easier to get through the blood-brain barrier for people who can’t metabolize folic acid”, he says.Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate, or vitamin B, a nutrient that helps the body make red blood cells and is essential for “healthy cell growth and function”, according to theMayo Clinic. Folate is naturally found in leafy greens, beans, nuts and fruit like oranges and bananas.Folic acid is especially important for individuals who are newly pregnant or might become pregnant.“Not having enough folate during fetal development causes abnormalities of the brain,” says Dr Edward Quadros, a professor in the department of medicine at SUNY Downstate who specializes in folate absorption.Specifically, it can lead to major birth defects of the brain and spine called neural tube defects (NTD). To prevent this, the CDCrecommendsthose who might become pregnant take 400mg of folic acid a day.The side effects of leucovorin are fairly minimal, says Mandell, and generally involve gastrointestinal discomfort. One 2021review studyin the Journal of Personalized Medicine found that, in individuals with autism spectrum and CFD, side effects of leucovorin were generally mild, but in some cases included aggression, agitation, headaches, insomnia and increased tantrums.What is the link between folate deficiency and autism?It’s not entirely clear.“What percentage of autistic people have folate deficiencies is still under investigation,” says Dr Matthew Lerner, associate professor and director of the Life Course Outcomes research program at the AJ Drexel Autism Institute at Drexel University. But he adds that it’s “certainly not a majority”.The FDA’s linking of CFD and autism was perplexing to some.Mandell notes that the approval announcement says leucovorin can help children with CFD and that, because “these children have some autism-like symptoms, therefore we should consider it as a treatment for autism”, Mandell says.“That’s quite a Rube Goldberg-like set of contortions,” he adds.“People in the general population tend to think of autism as one diagnosis,” says Dr Elliott Gavin Keenan, a post-doctoral fellow at the AJ Drexel Autism Institute. In reality, he says, autism can be caused by a variety of factors including genetics and severe maternal stress during pregnancy. “It’s really a spectrum of different disorders, and they all probably have different treatments.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But for at least a decade, Mandell estimates, people have been exploring the off-label use of leucovorin for autism treatment.The Facebook group Leucovorin for Autism currently has over 45,000 members. And on Reddit, users in subreddits like r/Autism_Parenting have discussed the drug for years. “My two sons both take leucovorin,” wrote one user in 2023. “In one son, it works great. [For] the other it is mediocre.”Keenan recalls taking leucovorin for his autism and bipolar disorder back in 2018. “I didn’t notice a big improvement,” he says, nor did he notice any negative side effects. “It just went straight through me,” he says. He stopped taking the drug after a few months.Autism researchers don’t discount that leucovorin could potentially be helpful to some people with autism. But they say much more research is needed in order to identify the populations that could benefit from it the most.“To take the promise of something like leucovorin seriously, you need rigorous, double-blind, placebo-controlled, transparent trials,” says Lerner.How does the FDA usually approve drugs?In his statement announcing the FDA’s approval of leucovorin, Makary said that the agency had reached this decision after “a systematic analysis of literature published between 2009-2024”. This appears to be a significant departure from how the agency has historically approved drugs.“There have been several efforts to have other medications approved for autism,” says Lerner. “Those have been years long, involving very large, extensive, rigorous, careful studies. And in most cases, they were not approved.”According to the FDA’sown website, the drug approval process is complex and time consuming, involving years of clinical trials, evaluation of research and inspection of facilities where the drugs will be manufactured.Keenan acknowledges that the FDA’s usual approval process is “expensive and imperfect”. But, he adds, “it keeps people safe”.The FDA’s leucovorin announcement was also shocking because, unlike the FDA’s usual approvals, it did not include dosage recommendations or guidelines of how to safely take the drug. Without this information, Lerner argues, their guidance amounts to, “Hey, here’s this medication, maybe you should try it.”“I can’t think of another instance where something reaches approval and there are no guidelines,” says Lerner. “That’s generally not how we do care in this country, or in the modern world.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I take a break for lunch and then get back on the computer for more quizzes,” he says. “It sounds like an illness, and others may diagnose it as that, but I am that obsessed. It’s not an exaggeration to say I treat it as an eight-hour job – a full-time day.”Schultz is Australia’s #1 ranked quizzer, the name for the people who take trivia very seriously. It’s a hobby he’s structured his entire life around. For about six weeks a year, Schultz films the Channel 7 show The Chase Australia, where he serves as one of the quizshow’s “chasers” – the experts whom contestants must topple if they want to take home the prize money (his nickname on the show, fittingly, is The Supernerd). The rest of the time, he’s just brushing up on his African capitals, AFL drafts or Academy Award winners.“What I should be doing is going out and doing other work, like a normal human being,” he laughs. “But hey, I’m a single man. I don’t have a family. I have no responsibilities … I’m in this unique situation where I have the time.”View image in fullscreenSchultz as the Supernerd on the Channel 7 show The Chase Australia.Photograph: The ChaseAnd it could be worse: “There are people, especially in the UK and USA, who are devoting even more hours to this than I am.”Quizzing is a niche but global pursuit, undertaken everywhere from North America to Europe and India, where it’s particularly popular. You might think of it as a step above pub trivia, particularly in terms of difficulty: Schultz used to play in pub teams seven days a week before levelling up. “When you get to international quizzing, pub trivia just isn’t obscure enough,” he says.In quizzing, typical questions might span the relatively straightforward (“Who was the military dictator of Chile from 1973 to 1990?”) through to more cryptic tasks, like naming the word that links a series of seemingly disparate images.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAnd instead of taking place inside a rowdy watering hole, most of the time quizzing is undertaken in silence or solitude. The biggest event on the annual quizzing calendar is the World Quizzing Championships, held each June, where quizzers have two hours to write out their answers to questions read by a proctor in an exam-style in-person setting; as of 2024, Australia also has its own national championship, which was most recently held in February with venues in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. These competitions – which come with zero prize money – determine the national and global quizzer rankings, but devotees will also find other smaller competitions and Zoom leagues to keep busy with – and, as Schultz so diligently does, devote spare time to brushing up on their general knowledge.View image in fullscreen‘When you get to international quizzing, pub trivia just isn’t obscure enough’: Issa Schultz.Photograph: The Guardian“Mostly when I explain to people what I’m doing on the weekend, I say, ‘I’m going to a library to just sit in silence for an hour with a group of other nerds’,” says Sally Gridley, another of Australia’s enthusiastic quizzers. “We do an exam for fun. They’re like, are there prizes? I say, no, it’s just about the glory, and you pay to do it.”Gridley has been quizzing seriously for the last 11 years and even once won The Chase, with her team taking home $102,000 in prize money for their efforts. Quiz TV shows like The Chase and Mastermind are popular, both for the thrill and the fact that they’re the only real way to monetise their hobby. Gridley estimates Australia’s quizzing community to be made up of around only 30 to 35 regular quizzers; worldwide, theglobal leaderboardreveals an unofficial membership of just under 2,000. It is a small but dedicated scene, participants say – but one that is friendly, supportive and always welcoming to newcomers.‘One last nervous wee and bam!’: what it’s like winning Mastermind AustraliaRead moreIt is, however, dominated by a particular demographic: men. Gridley estimates she’s one of about eight regular female quizzers in Australia, putting the local scene at about 90% male – something she can best attribute to the social stigma of it being a “nerdy” pursuit that women perhaps don’t see themselves fitting into. And there’s overlap in other communities, too.“It takes one to know one, but quizzing is fairly [popular] in neurodivergent demographics as well – a lot of quizzers have conditions like autism or ADHD,” Gridley says. “And there’s lots of introverts. Like, I’m probably the most gregarious person in the room at any quiz function.”Or as Schultz puts it: “There’s a lot of eccentrics – and we love our eccentrics!”To make it up the leaderboard as a quizzer, one certainly must have the capacity for a certain type of obsession.View image in fullscreen‘It’s just about the glory’: quizzer Sally Gridley with her prize from ABC’s Hard Quiz.Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianThirty-five-year-old finance worker Aaran Mohann, ranked third in Australia, considers himself less diligent with study than many others – devoting only around six hours a week to it. His primary tactic is to do as many online quizzes as possible, in the hope the answers burrow into his brain. Quizzes, he says, tend to tread similar ground – right now, for instance, many are covering pop culture phenomena like theColdplay concert affairorDubai chocolate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a system that “makes no sense to anyone but myself”.He does draw a line, though: “Pat Gibson is one of the greatest British quizzers of all time and he reads something like five newspapers a day. I just can’t bring myself to do that – there’s too much bad news.”View image in fullscreenAustralia's representatives at the 2024 Quizzing Olympiad in Spain (Aaran Mohannis far right), with Jane Allen of the International Quizzing Association.Photograph: SuppliedEven outside the thrill of competition and TV turns, there’s a lot to love about being a dedicated quizzer. Gridley enjoys the sense of accomplishment that comes with getting an answer right, and the facts she’s gained along the way have proven beneficial in her job as a teacher. Mohann says the hobby rewards his natural curiosity about the world. Quizzing, which demands a close reading of the questions lest you disastrously name a city when the test paper actually asked for a country, has also sharpened his attention to detail.And for Schultz, there’s a calming consistency to the pursuit.“I love that it’s all about facts and truths, especially in this day and age when there’s AI and [fake news],” he says. “We can ignore all that and come back to, which King of England was beheaded in 1649? It was Charles I then, it will be Charles I tomorrow, it will still be Charles I in 100 years’ time.”Schultz loves the life he’s built around quizzing – for better or worse.“I’ve never driven a car. I can’t cook. I’m the sort of person who will lose his house keys … I think I’m a lost cause outside of quizzing. I’m doomed beyond compare.”Schultz’s focus now is retaining his #1 ranking in Australia – something he’s held every year since 2011 – and eventually climbing from a #15 world ranking to claim the #1 spot.“Usain Bolt, who’s the world’s fastest man, he’s devoted his entire life to running. So I’m willing to devote my entire life to quizzing,” he says. “I mean, why not?”Explore more on these topicsQuiz and trivia gamesSeven NetworkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I watched it numerous times – but then stopped because I was so horrified.” The Canadian artist is talking about The Birth of a Nation, one of the most controversial films in Hollywood history, a three-hour silent drama directed by DW Griffith based on an earlier, obsolete novel by Thomas Dixon Jr. After its release in 1915, it provoked riots across the US for its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan. The film is widely deemed responsible for reinvigorating the Klan’s reputation and bolstering its membership. Despite attempts to ban it, The Birth of a Nation broke box-office records.It takes place in the US south during the civil war (1861-65) and the ensuing Reconstruction era. It follows members of the pro-Union, abolitionist Stoneman family and the pro-Confederacy Camerons. The plot takes in the founding of the KKK, using white actors in blackface. Douglas first thought about remaking The Birth of a Nation 20 years ago when he was doing a series of movie recreations. He abandoned the project but returned to it recently, when Los Angeles gallery The Brick invited him to make a response to the removal of Confederate monuments in the US south. “The ideas of identification, self-identification and imposed identification,” he says, speaking via Zoom from Vancouver, “all came together in my concept.”View image in fullscreen‘I got tired of spending all my money on dance records’ … Stan Douglas.Photograph: Jimmy Jeong/The GuardianDouglas, 64, was born and raised in a white, middle-class neighbourhood in Vancouver. In the 1980s, alongside artists such as Jeff Wall, Rodney Graham and Vikky Alexander, he was part of the Vancouver School, a group of young artists responding to mass media imagery with conceptual, postmodern photography and films. He studied at Vancouver’s Emily Carr College of Art, but just as important were the years he spent working as a DJ at a gay bar in the city. Eventually, he quit – “I got tired of spending all my money on dance records” – but DJing still shapes his art: “How to play the right part of the song at the right time, using culture to make new culture, using time-based media to make an idea or a feeling.”A master of the remix, Douglas is known for films and photographs that splice together the lowbrow and the lofty, turning fiction into fact, suturing landscapes and reshuffling the past. Previous works include an immersive six-hour video of an improvised jam session by a fictional 1970s band, while he has used photography to recreate the crowds at major riots around the world. He has also reworked films by Alfred Hitchcock, Dario Argento and Orson Welles. His latest show, which has just opened at Victoria Miro in London, features his remake of The Birth of a Nation.The original film explains many aspects of US culture. “The idea of whiteness comes from the 17th century,” he says. “Indentured labourers, black and white, were working together. The idea that whiteness was inherently superior – with the possibility of upward mobility, a solidarity with the elite – didn’t happen until 50 years into the slave trade.” This would be around 1670. “It was enforced by the repetition of these ideas in legislation, in churches and in town squares.”View image in fullscreenContradicting the narrative… Douglas at work in his studio.Photograph: Jimmy Jeong/The GuardianBirth of a Nation, as Douglas has called his five-channel work, remixes a particularly chilling and violent scene from the 1915 film into a 13-minute installation. Silent and shot in black and white, in keeping with the original, it focuses on a scene in which Gus, an emancipated slave played by a white actor in blackface, meets the chaste young Cameron daughter, Flora, in a forest. He proposes marriage. Appalled, Flora runs away and hurls herself off a cliff. Gus is subsequently lynched by the Klan, the mob being led by Flora’s brother Ben.In Douglas’s version, one channel plays the original scene, while the other four screens carry his remakes. His Flora is a far less sympathetic figure, who lobs stones at a bird for amusement, then trips and accidentally falls to her death. Meanwhile, other sequences contradict the narrative of the original. Douglas invents two black male characters called Sam and Tom. Like Gus, they are also freedmen who have become Confederate captains.Gus is recast as a kind of hallucination, who appears to the white characters whenever they see Sam or Tom, blurring their identities. “To them,” explains Douglas, “all black men are the same black man and are not to be trusted – a source of sexual violence.” Although the original film is more than a century old, Douglas finds some of its conflicting ideas very current, from the suggestion that “the US nation could only be born by undoing black suffrage” to the suppression of voting rights. “The Klan was the agent to take care of that,” he says of the latter, “to make the US a white supremacist society.”View image in fullscreenFive-channel remake … Douglas’s Birth of a Nation.Photograph: Olympia Shannon/Stan DouglasDouglas has produced work on this theme before. His 1991 video I’m Not Gary sees a white man mistake a black man for another called Gary. The black man responds with a frown and says: “I’m not Gary.” The 30-second video briefly made it on to Canadian TV, part of a series that ran during ad breaks. Confused viewers called the station to complain.Douglas’s last major exhibition in Europe included the film ISDN, made for the Canadian Pavilion at the 2022 Venice Biennale. In a 16th-century former Venetian salt factory, he installed a two-screen call-and-response between TrueMendous and Lady Sanity, from London, and Cairo-based rappers Raptor and Yousef Joker. Douglas found connections between the politically chargedmahraganat– Egyptian street music that emerged during the Arab spring – and the Tottenham MCs’ lyrics about race, injustice and uprising. “That period of grime,” he says, “was a soundtrack for the 2011 protests in London.”Douglas is also “a big fan of the opera”, which is what drew him to the 18th-century British dramatist John Gay. The second part of his Victoria Miro show is a series of photographs, The Enemy of All Mankind: Nine Scenes from John Gay’s Polly. These restage scenes from an obscure 1729 comic opera by Gay via large-scale staged pictures shot in the mountains of Jamaica, with Hollywood production effects. They feature American and Jamaican actors dressed in detailed 18th-century costume (borrowed from New York’s Metropolitan Opera). Written as a sequel to Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera, Polly shares its theme of misidentification and racial perception, but with a very different stance. “It’s a crazy story,” he enthuses. “It depicts imperial patriarchal hierarchies of race and class, as well as gender norms, as performative.”View image in fullscreenA pirate vanquished by a queen … an image from The Enemy of All Mankind: Nine Scenes from John Gay’s Polly.Photograph: Stan Douglas/Victoria Miro/David ZwirnerThe opera follows the capers of the eponymous protagonist Polly through the Caribbean as she tries to find her exiled husband – an escaped indentured labourer who is now a pirate called Macheath. Considered too piquant a satire at the time, with its blunt critique of Britain’s colonial ambitions, it was censored by the government and never performed in Gay’s lifetime.Like an 18th-century Some Like It Hot, it has an outlandish plot that involves subterfuge, skirmishes, colonial settlers, courtesans, a Maroon queen and pirates aplenty. Douglas sees pirates as radical political figures. “Back then,” he says, “pirate ships weren’t like in the Disney movies. They were like democracies on water.” His interest stems from his ongoing research into Maroon societies – large communities who escaped chattel slavery in the Americas and formed their own independent, free societies. In Jamaica, some of these thrived for centuries.Piecing together pivotal moments from the opera, The Enemy of All Mankind is a flamboyant visual romp with deliberately preposterous titles to steer you through the action. It gives an alternative image of history, but even here things ultimately fall apart. The pirates are defeated and, in Gay’s original, Macheath is executed. Douglas smiles. “This whole idea of liberation,” he says, “has a dark side that always comes back on itself.”Stan Douglas: Birth of a Nation and The Enemy of All Mankind is at Victoria Miro, London, until 1 November.Explore more on these topicsVideo artRacePhotographyCanadainterviewsShareReuse this content"

The Moroccan artist has spent her career experimenting with colour theory, deep diving into the history of dyes, disentangling the threads of colonialism and exploitation that run through the history of art. Her show at the South London Gallery is basically colour theory as resistance, minimalism as revolt, the dyeing process as anti-colonialism.If that sounds brain numbingly leaden and eye-meltingly dull, you might be surprised by the results, because the gallery is actually a very pleasant pastel wonderland. The space is painted in thick white and light pink stripes (in a nod to aDaniel Burenmural in Casablanca that got painted over). It’s like walking through a bag of sweets. The walls are dotted with silk canvases that ripple with geometric shapes and shimmering soft colours. The dyes come from the Mothership,Barrada’s “eco-campus” in Tangierwhere she grows the plants and processes the pigments that get used in these artworks.View image in fullscreenA symbol of exploitation … Untitled, 2025.Photograph: Damian Griffiths/courtesy the artist and Pace GalleryDyes are not just colours here: they are symbols of colonial history, of how dyeing techniques have been imported and appropriated from all over the world for western financial gain. They’re symbols of industrialisation and exploitation.A pile of big monochromatic cubes in the corner is a reference to modernist urban planning in Casablanca. A vitrine is filled with wooden blocks arranged into shapes based on acrobatic human pyramids. Everywhere here there are references to Moroccan culture and the history of modernism.One work co-opts aFrank Stellapainting, reimagining its mid-century minimalism in soft silken textiles. Another uses obscure colour theory to analyse the hues of a Tintin comic book about Palestine, reducing a complex story of displacement and erasure to a grid of yellow and beige squares. These are the colours of the desert, the architecture, the history of the region as seen through orientalist eyes.Barrada’s approach is interesting, hugely collaborative and clearly intentional in the way it’s researched and expressed, but the results just aren’t particularly interesting. It all just looks like so much minimal abstraction, like grids and squares you’ve seen a thousand times. And that’s the main issue with most of the work here. As fascinating as her point may be, as clever, referential and passionate as her work is, at best it looks like a textile version of geometric modernism, at worst like a very nice silk scarf. It’s decorative and unexciting.View image in fullscreenReferencing another Tangier … Barrada’s wire crab cages.Photograph: Photo © Lucy DawkinsEven when she is exploring other ideas – such as those human pyramids, or the experimentation with “void fill” paper used in packaging and shipping – it never reaches particularly thrilling visual heights.The best work here ditches the minimalist silks for sculptural installation. Wire crab cages have been stacked together and formed into a circle in the middle of the gallery. They reference another Tangier: Tangier Island, a crabbing community in the US at desperate risk of being lost to rising sea levels. Barrada’s permeable towers are a “beau geste”, a noble but futile gesture, an attempt to build a sea wall and keep nature at bay, to resist even in the face of certain destruction.I like Barrada’s ideas, the narratives she explores, the histories she tears apart. But for the most part, the visual results are pretty, but very boring.AtSouth London Galleryuntil 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTextile artArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Europe had waited 21 years to lead at the end of a Ryder Cup’s opening day on American soil. In 2004, they romped to victory at Oakland Hills. There should be no sense of a similar procession forLuke Donaldand his 2025 contingent. Nonetheless, the strength of Europe’s early performance in New York felt hugely significant. It is Keegan Bradley, the US captain, who does not have his troubles to seek. Europe won two sessions out of two, including five of the first six matches.“We have only played 28% of the points,” said a bullish Bradley. “This is first quarter. We’ve still got three quarters to go. I’ve got a lot of faith in my boys.” As shadows lengthened, the final joust of the day became the most captivating.Rory McIlroyand Shane Lowry faced Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns in a fourball contest that ebbed and flowed quite wonderfully. Europe had taken the foursome element by 3-1, with two more points subsequently secured. Bradley was cheered only by Cameron Young and Justin Thomas dismissing Ludvig Åberg and Rasmus Højgaard. Could Cantlay and Burns spare some blushes?Ryder Cup 2025: Europe extend lead to 5½-2½ over USA after day-one fourballs – live updatesRead moreLowry, McIlroy and Burns had putts for threes on the last. The score could flip between 5-3 and 6-2 depending on the success or otherwise of them. Lowry left his short. Burns missed to the right. McIlroy, once again central to epic theatre, had 12ft to win the match. The Masters champion watched his attempt slide agonisingly by the left of the hole. Europe’s 5 ½ plays 2 ½ for the USA.McIlroy soon acknowledged disappointment but admitted the European team would have bitten hands off for this scenario before a ball was struck. The visitors will be strong favourites to prevail again in Saturday’s morning foursomes.“We all knew how important it was to get off to a good start,” Donald said. “To win again this afternoon was another tick in a box. I am very happy with where we are.”Scottie Scheffler endured a miserable day at the office. It concluded on the 16th green in partnership with JJ Spaun, losing to Jon Rahm and Sepp Straka. Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood were one down to Ben Griffin andBryson DeChambeauafter 10. The Englishmen rallied brilliantly to prevail on the final green. Fleetwood’s putting over the closing stretch was magnificent.McIlroy and Lowry looked safe when two up on the 12th tee. A McIlroy putt somehow stayed above ground after a 360 degree circuit of the cup at the 13th, as the Americans won back-to-back holes to square the match. Both sides had chances thereafter but a half point each was ultimately fair.Bradley is already facing criticism. And no wonder. Picking foursomes as the first session worked for the Americans at Whistling Straits but they already had so many advantages in thatRyder Cup. Here, with the teams closely matched, Bradley surely erred in starting with a format Europe excel in. Donald and his players had an opportunity to gain early momentum which they did not waste. Bradley publicly insisted at lunchtime that the arrival of Donald Trump on Air Force One would assist his team. Yes, he really was that desperate.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy shows his emotion during the foursomes win against Collin Morikawa and Harris English.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAStatistical gurus had determined that Collin Morikawa and Harris English was the worst combination the US could deploy in a foursomes contest. What did Bradley do? In the penultimate game of the morning, McIlroy and Fleetwood hammered Morikawa and English 5&4. The Europeans had been five up after eight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Europe took this one 5&3. Donald struck gold with this pairing, which was heavily influenced by Europe’s use of data analysis.Rahm, the star of day one, combined with Tyrrell Hatton in the first match of this Ryder Cup to defeat DeChambeau and Thomas, 4&3. DeChambeau cracked a drive to within a flick of the 1st green. Two shots later, the USA were one up. DeChambeau and Thomas failed to win another hole. For all DeChambeau’s noise, for all DeChambeau’s fuss, he lost two out of two on Friday. “Luck is on their side right now,” said the Californian. Saucer of milk, Bryson?Foursomes solace for the hosts came in the final match, where Xander Schauffele and Cantlay defeated Robert MacIntyre and Viktor Hovland, 2up. MacIntyre was distracted by a spectator shot during his tee shot backswing at the 17th, a crucial moment which allowed the US to edge in front.There have already been too many similar interferences from those with outside the ropes carrying big mouths and much smaller brains. Generally, though, Europe’s showing has punctured the New York mood. Donald will be aware this is already a glorious opportunity to make history.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Rory McIlroyBryson DeChambeauLuke DonaldRyder CupGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s fair to say, though, that the Red Roses do have a few regrets, six of them stemming from World Cup final losses.The most recent was three years ago whenthey fell to defeatat the hands of New Zealand at Eden Park. This time they are hosting the final against Canada at their own iconic stadium and the question remains: can they finally do away with their World Cup demons or will they once again crumble on the biggest stage?Red card may figure in World Cup final between two physical attacking teams | Ugo MonyeRead moreEngland need to slow Canada down and get into the fight at the breakdown, while also maximising unpredictability on the attack. On the flip side, the world’s second-ranked side will have to maintain the pace in their game whichoverwhelmed the defending champions, New ­Zealand, last weekend, while also stopping the Red Rose players who can create something from nothing like Meg Jones and Ellie Kildunne.While the winner is difficult to predict, what is a given is that the occasion itself is going to be record-breaking. The England hooker Amy Cokayne, who scored a hat-trick in the 2022 final, cannot wait to play in front of 82,000: “For me, more the merrier. I think the bigger crowds we have had, that is when the big ­players stand up and we are a team full of big players. I have no doubt we will rise to the occasion.”One of those big players in the England team is the incumbent world player of the year, Kildunne, ­without a doubt the fans’ favourite. Every time she touches a ball during this tournament and beyond the stadium comes to life and fans were rapturous forher two brilliant solo effortsin the semi-final against France.The England head coach, John Mitchell, has heaped praise on the star full-back in the buildup to the final, saying: “Ellie is firstly a very humble young woman, very gifted athlete. She is very intuitive in the way that she plays. You’ve got to be careful how much structure you give her. It’s very much about what she sees in front of her.View image in fullscreenEngland are relishing the chance to play in front of 82,000 fans at Twickenham.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“She also works really hard at her game. She’s a breath of fresh air off the field because I think she feels that she can be authentic in our ­environment, which is important to her because ­little things like photography and podcasting give her energy. She’s a very creative person.“She’s got the challenge of being a phenomenal player and ­everyone wanting a piece of her and a ­commercial piece of her. So she’s got some challenges to deal with. I just hope the people that are ­managing her manage her well going forward because she’s still got a lot more left in her yet.”Mitchell also spoke about ­wanting this Red Roses side to fulfil their potential and become a “great” team. When asked if they would not be a great team if they lost, he responded: “They’ll still have to go and earn that, won’t they? You just never know when you can be defined. If you set a ceiling on the weekend, then that’s probably dangerous material.“If we get it done, we can still be even better. I just don’t know when it’s ever finite, to be totally fair with this team. If we don’t get it done, it won’t stop this team from growing. If we do get it done, it won’t stop this team from growing. There’s so much talent in this team, but ultimately it’d be nice for this team to be able to fulfil their potential and be rewarded for the effort that they’ve put in over a long period of time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That end has been helped with their longer preparation pre-tournament following a concerted fundraising effort calledMission: Win Rugby World Cup 2025.While Canada did crowdfund to fill a million-dollar gap, they are a semi-professional team subsidised by their federation and a lot of their players are fully professional, being contracted to Premiership Women’s Rugby clubs. Canada also have equal pay to their men’s team but England have a fully professional setup for the women’s side. England’s resources and home advantage mean they remain favourites but Canada are far from underdogs.What Kévin Rouet’s side have already won is the coin toss which meant they got to select which changing room they wanted. They have chosen the home facilities, meaning England will be in the away one. But when asked if the decision was made with any mind games in play, Rouet said: “I just wanted the big one, I don’t know. We said that the red was important to us also, so it was good for us. If you win the coin toss, you get the big changing room. There is no big thinking past that.”The final is set to be a thriller with the world’s two leading sides gunning for the trophy. But, however cliched this may sound, no matter who wins on Saturday the real champion is women’s rugby. England 2025 has marked a turning point for the sport in the past six weeks, and there will be no going back.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025Women's rugby unionRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Owen Farrell was rarely far from the action on his second Saracens debut – 17 years after his first – and though Nathan Michelow was shown the Prem’s first 20-minute red card for the visitors, this was an illustration of the length of the road ahead for the Red Bulls.Newcastle are not the first side to struggle to escape Saracens’ stranglehold and there were certainly some bright moments. The No 8 Amanaki Mafi was the pick of the summer signings, while Kingston Park has rarely been as vibrant as this in recent years and the manner in which a first sellout crowd in seven years celebrated Freddie Clarke’s try, with the game already up, felt telling. Truth be told, however, this was more reality check than revolution.“I don’t want to be guilty of drinking the Kool-Aid,” said Newcastle’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond. “What’s happened around the place is fantastic and you can see that, but we’ve got to get our basics right. A bit more graft on the training paddock. It was hard work getting a sellout and we’ve got to match the commercial side of the business on the field.”View image in fullscreenAlex Hearle got Newcastle’s new era off to a lightning start with a try after just 90 seconds.Photograph: Bruce White/Colorsport/ShutterstockFarrell, starting at inside centre for Saracens for the first time in a decade, was a commanding presence for the visitors. He looks a touch bulkier so perhaps No 12 is his future position for club, and maybe even country. Farrell kicked 12 points, with Brandon Jackson, Andy Onyeama-Christie, the excellent Nick Tompkins (twice) and Noah Caluori all crossing for tries on an evening that began with sparkle for the Red Bulls but finished decidedly flat. It was 19-year-old Caluori who provided the champagne moment on his debut, dexterously kicking a chipped ball ahead before gathering and racing away to the line.Given the sense of occasion it was little surprise that Newcastle began quickly. A sustained period of pressure forced a wide-open gap in the Saracens defence and Alex Hearle timed his run on to the pass perfectly to dash to the try-line after 90 seconds. Newcastle fans feared the worst when the referee Adam Leal went upstairs but a tip-tackle by Michelow on George McGuigan had been spotted in the buildup and Saracens’ 21-year-old was given his marching orders.Quick GuideBath roar back to beat Quins despite Evans hat-trickShowA first-half hat-trick from the Harlequins flanker Will Evans proved in vain as reigning champions Bath got the new Gallagher Prem season off to a winning start with a 47-31 comeback victory at Twickenham Stoop.Bath were rattled in the first half by an enterprising Quins and trailed 17-7 at one stage. But once Chandler Cunningham-South had received a yellow card, there was only one team in the contest as Bath scored 33 unanswered points.Jack Kenningham and Tyrone Green were the hosts' other try scorers with Jarrod Evans converting two. Bath responded with seven tries. Henry Arundell grabbed a pair with Tom Dunn, Ben Obano, Billy Sela, Archie Griffin, Henry Arundell and Sam Underhill also on the scoresheet, while Ben Spencer added five conversions and Tom de Glanville one.The Bath director of rugby, Johann van Graan, described the victory as \"clunky\", adding: \"Quins put us under a lot of pressure. They pressed at the breakdown and we didn't react quickly enough and were happy just to be only 17-14 down at half-time.\"We showed good composure in the second half by scoring straight away and it was a good performance after the interval to pick up five points as it's never easy coming here.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Saracens were shell-shocked but got themselves on the scoreboard with a Farrell penalty. Before 10 minutes were on the clock, Farrell was in the thick of things again, taking a whack on the face when trying to tackle McGuigan. Blood was streaming from his splattered face but, as he tends to, Farrell soldiered on regardless.Having weathered the early storm Saracens were ahead before they were back to 15 men, Jackson finishing in the right-hand corner after sharp hands from Tompkins. Farrell missed the conversion and not long after a crucial turnover by Mafi, Newcastle were back ahead with a Brett Connon penalty. Saracens flexed their muscles again before the interval, however, systematically going through the phases before Onyeama-Christie splashed over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The club’s medics and Palmer himself (reluctantly, you suspect) have decided that rest is the only cure for the groin issue that has held him back at various points this season.Palmer will sit it out against Brighton on Saturday, Benfica and José Mourinho on Tuesday and Liverpool next Saturday; all of the matches are at Stamford Bridge. It will then be taken as read that Palmer will not be able to join up with England for the friendly with Wales at Wembley and the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreIt will be Thomas Tuchel’s fourth camp as the England manager and his third without Palmer because of injury. Which is not ideal in the countdown to the World Cup. The hope at Chelsea is that their main man will be revived by the time they go to Nottingham Forest on 18 October.And yet, once the Palmer news had been digested, it was actually easy to be assailed by all of the other stuff that is testing Maresca as he reels from a sticky sequence of results and goes into a week that could define the early season for him.The manager revealed he would be without Tosin Adarabioyo until after the international break because of a calf problem; the centre-half felt it in the wake of last Saturday’s 2-1loss at Manchester United, where he came on after the early dismissal of the goalkeeper Robert Sánchez.With that in mind, the last thing Maresca needed was for his back-up goalkeeper, Filip Jörgensen, to come for a third-minute high ball at Lincoln in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night and punch Wesley Fofana in the head as they both looked to clear.Fofana was able to play on and he lasted the 90 minutes asChelsea won 2-1. But he would later present symptoms of concussion and must now observe the relevant protocols, meaning he cannot play for 12 days after the incident. So another central defender will miss Brighton, Benfica and Liverpool.Levi Colwill is a long-term knee injury absentee and Benoît Badiashile has not played all season and only just returned to training, making him a doubt for Brighton. Maresca’s options at centre-half could extend no further than Trevoh Chalobah and Josh Acheampong. The latter has been ill this week, re-entering the group for training on Thursday.It is no exaggeration to say that Maresca has problems throughout the spine of his team – from back to front. The recklessness of Sánchez’s red card has been well documented, leading to a one-game ban, which he served against Lincoln.View image in fullscreenWesley Fofana (right) played 90 minutes against Lincoln but later showed symptoms of concussion after a clash with Filip Jörgensen.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesBut if Jörgensen was not great when he replaced him at Old Trafford, failing to come for the high ball that led to United’s second goal, he endured a horrible evening at Lincoln. There were Chelsea fans who thought his connection with Fofana was the only time he located a spherical object. Sánchez is poised to return against Brighton, his previous club, with a point to prove.In midfield, Maresca is without Dário Essugo, who is a long-term casualty, and Roméo Lavia – like Badiashile – has only just rejoined for training, having not played this season. He is also a doubt. “Roméo and Benoît are better,” Maresca said. “We’ll see if they can join us. Otherwise it will be for the next one.”With Palmer out, it is an irritation that Facundo Buonanotte, who is on loan from Brighton, is ineligible to face his parent club. Liam Delap’s hamstring injury-absence squeezes Maresca’s options up front.

Six, if the striker Marc Guiu is included; Maresca has said that the 19-year-old needs to improve.The theme is physical strain and how to cope with it because it appears to be pressing everywhere. Take João Pedro, a starter in each game until Lincoln when Maresca rested him, admitting the striker was feeling something. João Pedro had his first training session of the week only on Thursday.“João is better from the problem,” Maresca said. “Since he arrived with us he has played almost every game. So probably that is the reason why he has some problem. In some moments we need to think about giving him some rest.”It remains impossible to ignore the hangover from the Club World Cup, where Chelsea were victorious, even though Maresca continues to say it is unclear whether the unusually short pre-season that followed has been an issue.Since the home win over Fulham at the end of August, Chelsea have conceded a stoppage-time equaliser at Brentford andlost at Bayern Munichand United before the Lincoln result. Maresca’s switch to 5-2-1-1 at United after the Sánchez sending-off was criticised and he has had to defend the club’s decision to cast Axel Disasi and Raheem Sterling into exile.Maresca made it clear that Disasi would not be recalled to answer the problems in central defence. “There is not any information from the club to consider that so at the moment he is not an option,” he said. Maresca, though, recognises the need for solutions.Explore more on these topicsChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

Leicester were staring down the barrel of a second league defeat of the season but a late equaliser extended their own unbeaten run to five matches while denying West Brom the chance to climb into the top two before the rest of the weekend’s action.The hosts were looking to respond to back-to-back defeats and they went ahead in the 10th minute thanks to a brilliant goal from Samuel Iling-Junior, who grabbed his first in West Brom colours. The visitors were limited to half-chances in the second period in what looked to be a frustrating second half until Phillips put into his own goal which sent the travelling contingent wild as Leicester rescued a fifth point from losing positions this season.Leicester started brightly and a decent chance fell the way of Jordan Ayew in the third minute but he sent a one-touch finish across goal. West Brom had the opening goal of the contest with their first real foray forward and finished thanks to a piece of brilliance from Iling-Junior. Aune Heggebø flicked it off to the England Under-21 international and he danced his way round the challenge of several defenders before he slipped the ball beyond the onrushing Jakub Stolarczyk.View image in fullscreenSamuel Iling-Junior races away after giving West Brom an early lead.Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/ShutterstockThat did not seem to knock the spirit of Leicester who showed plenty of intent going forward, Jordan James saw an effort deflect over the bar before Harry Winks tried an audacious volley but Joshua Griffiths was yet to be troubled.Jayson Molumby forced Stolarczyk into the first save of the contest with an effort from range and was alert enough to keep out Heggebø a couple of minutes later. Griffiths was brought into action straight after the interval as a cross picked out Jannik Vestergaard but he was not able to power his header beyond the goalkeeper.West Brom could have had a second when Ayew failed to deal with a ball into the box and the ball fell kindly for George Campbell but whacked it into the side netting from a tight angle.Josh Maja came off the bench and twice had a chance to bury the contest, firstly when his goalbound effort was blocked behind by Wout Faes before Maja blasted over with the goal at his mercy in stoppage time. And Leicester punished him for those missed chances when they levelled the scores three minutes into stoppage time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leigh started with a period of relentless pressure, Umyla Hanley just denied on the end of Lachlan Lam’s kick through before Hanley popped a pass to Brand to skip over in the corner for the opener.View image in fullscreenJosh Charnley touches down for Leigh.Photograph: Nigel French/Bradley Collyer/PAPoor handling was hardly helping the Wakefield cause, Josh Griffin’s knock-on allowing Joe Ofahengaue to barge within inches, and the inevitable second try soon followed when Lam scooped a short pass to Hanley, whose burst set up Liu to crash over the last tackle.Charnley scooted over on the opposite flank to extend the home side’s lead and Wakefield’s welcome spell of pressure came much too late for the massed ranks of visiting fans behind the posts.The away side at least showed signs of fight and Jayden Myers’s persistence got them over for their opener within four minutes of the restart after a lovely floated pass from the impressive Mike McMeeken. But Mason Lino missed his kick from the touchline and a subsequent O’Brien penalty ensured the hosts retained their comfortable advantage heading towards the hour mark.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The market, though, preferred the chance of Charlie Appleby’s Opera Ballo, the winner of four from five, and it appeared to be a sensible choice in the early stages as William Buick settled Opera Ballo off the pace while Zeus Olympios pulled hard for his head in mid-division.Cheltenham woos back racegoers with cheaper Guinness and return of Ladies DayRead moreBuick was ideally positioned to advance and get first run on his field and hit the front going into the Dip, but Clifford Lee and Zeus Olympios were soon chasing him down and they left Opera Ballo standing half a furlong out, powering two and a quarter clear for a fourth straight success.Zeus Olympios’s refusal to settle in the first quarter-mile made his eventual style of victory all the more impressive and he seems certain to step up into Group One company for the first time on his next trip to the track.That, though, may not be for another eight months, unless Burke and Sheikh Mohammed Obaid, Zeus Olympios’s owner, decide to supplement the three-year-old for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Champions Day, where the owner already has a leading contender in Rosallion.“I wouldn’t say he’s taken us by surprise, we’ve always thought he was a lovely horse, but he was such a weak horse as well,” Burke said. “He arrived to us from Roger Varian’s as a bit of a shell and then he got a bit of injury, but so often when those immature two-year-olds get injuries, as long as they’re not major, it’s a blessing in disguise as you have to lock them up and all they do is grow and strengthen.“I think he has to be a very good horse for the favourite to get first run on us today and for us to then come and cut him down. I’ve always said he’s very much a horse for next year and I’m sure next season we’ll start by aiming at the Lockinge [at Newbury in May] and go from there.”In the Group Two Rockfel Stakes, Zanthos made all the running against the stands’ rail under Oisin Murphy and emphatically reversed her previous form with Touleen, the 11-10 favourite.View image in fullscreenZanthos and Oisin Murphy pictured winning the Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket.Photograph: Steven Cargill/racingfotos.com/ShutterstockThe win qualified Simon and Ed Crisford’s filly for a start in the Breeder’s Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf at Del Mar on 31 October but she is more likely to be put away for the winter before a three-year-old debut in a 1,000 Guineas trial in the spring.“The sensible thing is probably to bring her back for a Fred Darling or a Nell Gwyn in the spring and see where we go from there,” Ed Crisford said. “We always felt she would stay a mile, the riders at home felt she would stay a mile and Oisin feels she could stay a mile.”Fifth Column can seal Gosden recordThe 24-runner turnout for the Cambridgeshire at Newmarket on Saturday is one of the smallest fields in the near 200-year history of the first leg of the Autumn Double, but it is still a daunting prospect for punters with at least a fair case to be made for all but two or three.Older horses have won the last five runnings but that stat also looks under threat with two three-year-olds, Treble Tee andFifth Column(3.40), heading the market overnight.Both arrive with highly progressive profiles but the style of Fifth Column’s last-gasp win at York last month suggests that this step up to nine furlongs will lead to further improvement, and he is worth backing at around 7-1 to give John Gosden a record-extending sixth Cambridgeshire success.Newmarket 1.50A fascinating renewal of the Royal Lodge Stakes, with six of the eight runners priced up in single figures, and a potentially significant moment for the Amo Racing operation as the Group One-enteredAncient Egyptputs his unbeaten record on the line. The 1.1m gns son of Frankel looked an ideal type for this race when winning a Goodwood maiden in August in a notably strong time and arrives with a similar profile to Bow Echo, the 2-1 favourite, so odds of around 8-1 for Charlie Johnston’s colt look generous, not least as the stable has sent out three winners of this race since 2008.Haydock 2.05All but a couple of these sprint handicappers have something to recommend them butBlue Storm,last year’s winner off a 1lb lower mark, could have a little more scope for improvement than most after a belated seasonal debut here three weeks ago.Newmarket 2.25Aidan O’Brien has a strong hand with two recent Group One runners-up in Beautify and True Love, butRoyal Fixationlooked well worth a try at this level when sweeping from almost last to first in less than a furlong in the Lowther at York last time. Palace Pier has already made a promising start to his stud career and Ed Walker’s filly could be a first Group One winner for her sire.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowRipon1.40 Here Forever 2.15 Zooter 2.50 Vince L’Amour 3.25 Another Baar (nap) 4.00 Hurstwood 4.40 Aequitas 5.15 SawgrassNewmarket1.50 Ancient Egypt 2.25 Royal Fixation 3.00 Wise Approach 3.40 Fifth Column (nb) 4.15 Queen Tamara 4.45 Act Of Kindness 5.20 Zabeel Flower 5.55 Dance In The StormHaydock2.05 Blue Storm 2.40 Woven 3.15 First Ambition 3.50 Lost Boys 4.25 Nada Two 5.00 Jungle Knight 5.35 Steel TigerMarket Rasen3.30 Settle Down Jill 4.05 Summerleaze 4.35 Lord 5.10 El Rio 5.45 Saligo Bay 6.15 Queens WishSouthwell4.19 Havin A Flyer 4.50 Siouxpersonic 5.25 Abando 6.00 Spirit Lead Me 6.30 One More Dream 7.00 Jesse Luc 7.30 Nelson Gay 8.00 Division Day 8.30 InquisitionWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Newmarket 3.00Wise Approachmade an eye-catching move into the lead in the Group One Prix Morny last time only to be run out of it close home.

They have reached the denouement of the last six tournaments while winning just once, also against Canada, in 2014. But on the evidence of this World Cup campaign, the current crop of Red Roses, who have amassed a record 32 successive victories, are ready to thrive on the greatest stage of all.

Emery believes his side now have something to build on.

Like Alexander Isak before him, the Germany international will need time to be assimilated into the team, but his manager, Eddie Howe, is confident he has what it takes to be a success on Tyneside. “Like any striker, you have to be in goalscoring areas, otherwise you won’t score,” Howe noted, not incorrectly.Rob Smythkeeps the live updates coming whileLouise TaylorandJonathan Wilsonprovide reports and analysis.Golf5pmRyder Cup liveScott Murrayreturns for the big finale. Each of the 12 singles matches, featuring every player on both teams, is worth one point while tied matches result in half a point each. There promises to be plenty of drama as the contest speeds to its Sunday climax. Past nail-biters include Bernhard Langer’s duel with Hale Irwin at Kiawah Island in 1991: the German missed a six-foot putt that would have earned a tie, allowing Team USA to take the trophy. Then there was Brookline in 1999 when José María Olazábal missed a crucial putt at the 17th after Justin Leonard sank a 45-foot birdie putt to lead a thrilling fightback for the hosts. Not forgetting the Miracle at Medinah in 2012, final-day excitement on an epic scale. With the Americans 10-6 up and needing only four wins and one half from the 12 singles, they blew it as the Europeans rallied and carved out a 14-13 lead thanks to Martin Kaymer’s win over Steve Stricker. It was left to Tiger Woods to salvage US hopes by beating Francesco Molinari: that pairing ended in a draw, and the visitors had completed golf’s greatest team comeback.Ewan Murray,Andy BullandBryan Armen Grahamreport from the Bethpage Black course.View image in fullscreenWill there be another dramatic Ryder Cup finale at Bethpage?Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsSportYour Guardian sport weekendfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s when he said he wanted the next election to be an “open fight” between “Labour and Reform”. In the speech itself, however, he identified his enemies in the abstract. He was against the “politics of predatory grievance”, which used the “infrastructure of division”. He also made a lovely case for London at the start, with its plentiful pubs and pleasant parks, remarking wryly that it was nothing like “the wasteland of anarchy that some would have you believe”.The problem is he needs to pick a lane. Either he was referring to Donald Trump’s comments at the UN earlier this week, when the leader of the free worldsaid Britain’s capitalhad a “terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it’s been changed, it’s been so changed. Now they want to go to sharia law”, in which case Starmer should say so. Or he was attempting to describe the ascendant hard right upturning our politics without identifying or reflecting upon its main mouthpieces, in which case, what the hell is he thinking?One issue is that you very often cannot tell what the prime minister is thinking, so camouflaged is any thought under the buzzwords of the day. “Patriotic renewal” is today’s invention, which could mean anything from bunging some cash to a community centre to becoming a clean-energy superpower. If you ever feel dispirited by this pabulum, just be thankful you weren’t in whatever meeting it was probably dreamed up in at the Tony Blair Institute.A far larger problem is the substance of Starmer’s fight with Reform. The most concrete announcement he made was that ofdigital ID cards, which will be mandatory for anyone trying to work in the UK. (It wasn’t in Labour’s 2024 manifesto, there are certainly people who wouldn’t have voted Labour had it been, but worrying about things like that feels very 20th century.) He explicitly proffered ID cards as a solution to illegal immigration. “It has been too easy for people to come here [and] slip into the shadow economy,” Starmer said. “We’ve been squeamish about saying things that are clearly true … the simple fact is that every nation needs to have control over its borders … our immigration system does need to be fair, otherwise it undermines trust, undermines people’s faith that we’re on their side.”By his own words, then, he condemns his intelligence: if migrants are in the shadow economy, how are ID requirements in the regular economy supposed to deter them? It’s almost as though that’s not the question he’s trying to answer. What’s really going on is an attempt to echo the anti-migrant passions of Reform, while simultaneously coming up with solutions that don’t sound fanciful. Starmer’s animating question at the moment is this: how can he appeal to those who love authoritarianism while not alienating those who hate it?To revive Labour, Starmer should go to conference with this pledge: we will clean politics of sleaze | Polly ToynbeeRead moreGreen energy was the other front of Starmer’s “fightback”, and he talked a decent game on renewables – first decrying Vladimir Putin’s boot on our neck, then promising nuclear, wind and solar energy, which would create jobs, drive down prices and address the climate crisis. We could cavil about the prominence of nuclear there, but the essence is fine. It broadly reiterates the promises made when Green New Deal was the buzz phrase, even if the surrounding emphasis on growth above all and fiscal responsibility hints that the ambition has been scaled right back.Realistically, though, the speed at which thisLabourgovernment has rolled over on the issue of immigration and asylum seekers – accepting Reform’s insistence upon its salience, failing to make the positive case for migration – makes you wonder how long its green credentials will last, once the right has them in its crosshairs. Will Starmer’s green promises survive until Nigel Farage starts a new campaign to end net zero? Or will he start to falter as soon as Kemi Badenoch promises to bring down everyone’s energy bills with the dregs of the North Sea?It’s a well-established feature, arguably the main feature, of any era where the hard right is on the march: elites make common cause with the masses, by means of an out-group, often racial minorities or people who aren’t citizens, and use the hatred thus generated as the abundant energy source for the movement. Our prime minister identified, in vague terms, a “cynical attempt to exploit [working class] fears” and kept himself above the fray, when in fact he is critical to the fray. He’s the poster boy of the ineffectual liberal who watches the world swerve to the right and tries to appease it with some light or, if you prefer, diet xenophobia. If we’re now talking about an “open fight” between Labour and Reform, let’s be open about this: he will not beat them by becoming more like them.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourReform UKImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

As I write this, Israel israzingGaza City to the ground in the latest stage of what many respected international human rights organizations and scholars have called a genocide. There aren’t as many images coming out of Gaza City as there should be because the Israeli military is still not allowing foreign reporters free access to Gaza and has murdered many of the journalists in the ground. In August, Al Jazeera’s team in Gaza City were deliberatelytargetedby Israel.‘If these words reach you … Israel has succeeded in killing me’: the last words of a journalist killed in GazaRead moreNature abhors a vacuum, but propagandists love it. As Gaza burns and information coming out of the strip is deliberately limited, highly paid marketers and PR people in multinational firms are busy rewriting history in real time. Earlier this month, Drop Site News, which has done essential work on Gaza,reported thatan American polling firm called Stagwell Global, founded by Mark Penn, was commissioned by Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs to rehabilitate Israel’s global image. Penn, for the uninitiated, is a pollster who facilitatedBill Clinton’s re-election in 1996 and then helpedHillary Clintonlose toBarack Obamain the 2008 primaries with a combination of hubris and racist stereotyping. “The right knows Obama is unelectable except perhaps against Attila the Hun,” Penn wrote in aClinton campaign memo. He also proposed characterizing Obamaas un-American. (Stagwelltold Adweekthe work in Israel was run by a “small team” and that its agencies work “across the political and issue spectrum”. Last week, a spokespersontold PRWeekthe work was a “defined project with a specific brief” that had now concluded.)Per Drop Site, the report from Penn’s firm apparently assessed that Israel has a good chance of making people forget about that nasty little genocide business if they stoke fear of “Radical Islam” and “Jihadism”. “Especially once the situation in Gaza is resolved, the room for growth in all countries [when it comes to Israel’s image] is very significant,” the report concludes. If you make people scared that babies are terrorists then they won’t mind when you murder them, basically. You can see the whole reporthere. (After you’ve read that, I recommend reading the newlegal analysisfrom a UN commission which accuses Israel of committing genocide. Here’s asnippet: “Israeli security forces shot at and killed civilians, including children who were holding makeshift white flags. Some children, including toddlers, were shot in the head by snipers.”)Once marketing firms have got their genocide-denial talking points ready to go, they need bots to help spread them. It wasreported by Sludge News last weekthat SKDKnickerbocker LLC, which is owned by Stagwell Global, signed a$600,000 contractto run a “bot-based program” to amplify pro-Israel narratives on Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube and other platforms. SKDK, which was co-founded by the longtime Joe Biden adviser Anita Dunn andregisteredas a foreign agent for Israel earlier this year, described a strategy to “flood the zone” with pro-Israel messaging.It’s not clear how much the zone has already been flooded but, last week, Politicoreportedthat SKDK has supposedly stopped its work with Israel and “begun the process of de-registering” as a foreign agent. SKDK and Stagwell also both said they did not work on a bot initiative, just “media relations”.The propaganda isn’t just changing minds – it’s breaking the mechanisms people use to process moral informationZoe ScamanPro-Israel propaganda campaigns are already working, saysZoe Scaman, a marketing expert who has been outspoken about Stagwell’s work. “The ‘flooding the zone’ strategy works because it doesn’t need to convince people genocide is good, it just needs to make them uncertain about what they’re seeing or tired of thinking about,” Scaman told me. “Look how successfully opposition to child killing has been made to seem like extremism. The propaganda isn’t just changing minds – it’s breaking the mechanisms people use to process moral information. When reality itself becomes contested territory, systematic killing becomes just another political disagreement.”Stagwell’s work, it should be stressed, is just one small part of Israel’s genocide-rebranding efforts. Last yearthe Times of Israel reportedthat the country’s foreign ministry was getting an additional $150m (£115m) to shape public opinion. Per the Times, the increasedhasbarabudget “would be used to influence sentiment in the foreign press and on social media”.That budget seems a little over the top because it’s been made clear that Israel doesn’t have to do much in order for a lot of the US media and political class to push its messaging. Hamas committed verified atrocities on 7 October, but one of the key talking points that helped manufacture consent for the genocide was the (now thoroughlydebunked) lie that they beheaded 40 babies. Normally journalists and politicians would fact-check such an inflammatory claim before disseminating it. Certainly, if a Palestinian media outlet made a claim like this, it would have to be triple-checked before anyone published it – even then it would probably go under the “opinion” section. But the beheaded babies lie was widely repeated by the likes of Joe Biden and CNN reporter Sara Sidner.While Sidner has nowapologizedfor not being careful with her words and the White Housewalked back Biden’s comments, other journalists haven’t done the same. The CBS News senior correspondent Norah O’Donnellstill has a tweetup from 10 October stating: “@CBSNewslearned that Israel body recovery teams have discovered beheaded babies and children in kibbutzim in southern Israel.” I emailed CBS News’s communication team to ask why they were continuing to perpetuate this misinformation and never heard back.Israel is wiping out Gaza’s journalists – and it’s no longer even hiding it | Jodi GinsbergRead moreCBS News is owned by Paramount Global, which has not been shy about its position as a cheerleader for Israel. Paramount is in theprocessof acquiring Bari Weiss’s Free Press, which has consistentlydownplayedthe genocide in Gaza and provided unapologetic support for Israel, for between $100m to $200m. Weiss will alsoreportedlybe tasked with “guiding the editorial direction of the [CBS news] division”. According to theFinancial Times, Weiss partly won over CBS owner David Ellison “by taking a pro-Israel stance”.David Ellison is the son ofLarry Ellison, a tycoon who oversees the technology company Oracle anddonated $16.6mto Friends of the Israel Defense Forces (FIDF) in 2017, the largest single gift in FIDF’s history. Oracle is currently among a consortium of firms that is looking to take over TikTok. If this happens, one imagines that TikTok’s algorithm may well get a more pro-Israel bent. One of the reasons that TikTok was put up for sale in the first place is because a lot of US lawmakers wereupsetwith pro-Palestinian messaging on the platform. Indeed,Mitt Romneyexplicitly referencedthe issuein relation to the “overwhelming support” to shut TikTok down. It becomes much easier to “flood the zone” with propaganda when you control the zone.It’s not just media outlets working overtime to help rehabilitate Israel’s image: if you’re American, it’s likely your elected representatives are too. Two hundred and fiftyAmerican state legislatorsjust traveled to Israel for the50 States, One Israelconference. I don’t know about you, but I’d far rather my representatives were doing something about public schools and healthcare in the US, instead of going on propaganda jaunts abroad.“One day, when it’s safe, when there’s no personal downside to calling a thing what it is, when it’s too late to hold anyone accountable, everyone will have always been against this,” the writer Omer El Akkad said in late October 2023, of the unfolding genocide inGaza. That quote, now the title of a book, went viral because it articulated what so many of us are desperate to believe: that while we may not see justice right now, one day the truth will out. One day there will be some sort of accountability. But while it’s important not to lose hope, I’m gradually finding it hard to maintain the optimism that one day everyone will always have been against this. It is looking far more likely that one day a lot of money will have been spent to rebrand this.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warCBScommentShareReuse this content"

People expect corrupting cash from the Tories, with their last cabinet of zillionaires umbilically linked to finance of every kind, but voters expect better from Labour. The first painful dent in the moral armour of Keir Starmer’s cabinet was the revelation offreebies he and others acceptedin clothes, glasses and tickets. There was a chance then to get on the front foot, using that minor but shabby embarrassment to declare a great clean-up of the sewage inflow of influence on politics from mega donations. But No 10 missed it.The dispute over Labour’s alleged failure to declaresizeable supportfrom the campaign group Labour Together offers another opportunity for Starmer to call time on big money in politics. TheTories have called for the electoral commission toconduct a new investigationinto this week’s allegations – including that Labour failed to declare staffing costs it received from Labour Together that covered McSweeney’s salary. In 2021, the watchdogfined Labour Together £14,250for failing to properly declare sizeable donations, which the campaign group blamed on an “administrative error”. Labour has clarified this week thatMcSweeney’s salarywas paid by Starmer’s leadership campaign in 2020, not Labour Together.But that’s not the point. Few will follow tortuous points of law. Every time people are reminded of eye-watering sums swashing about in our politics, they rightly think it stinks. And it does, even when all the rules are followed. There’s no way of knowing what, if any, influence donations have, but the public understandably assumes that some donors expect something in return. Even if they asked for nothing in return, why should the preferences of the wealthy swing our elections?Cash for honours has contaminated parliament since the dawn of time. “Dark money” finds loopholes in the law. According to analysis last year, almost £1 in every £10 donated to parties and politicians comes fromunknown or dubious sources: cash from companies that have never turned a profit, from unincorporated associations that do not have to declare their funders and banned donations from overseas donors via intermediaries, enters the system.A£75,000 donationto Robert Jenrick was mired in controversy after it was revealed that the donation was given by a company that financed it through a loan from a business registered in the Virgin Islands (Jenrick said the donation was “perfectly legal and valid”). But never mind what’s hidden when broad daylight is no disinfectant to the influence wielded by a rich minority. Between 2001 and 2021, a fifth of all donations to UK political parties came fromjust 10 big donors. While cash for honours is illegal, wealthy Conservative benefactors who donatemore than £3m to the partyhave found themselves getting seats in the House of Lords.The fright of Elon Musk’s rumoured threat todonate $100m (£78m)to Reformshould be enough to jolt the government into action. Musk can legally do this via the profits from his UK company. There is nothing to prevent a single man abroad from nearly doubling the total donations to UK political parties, which stood at£100m in 2024. The Committee on Standards in Public Life haspreviously calledfor an annual donation cap of £10,000 for individuals and organisations, covering expat donors too. The cash that flows in from them needs to be registered: currently, as Justin Fisher writes inPolitical Quarterly, there is no data available on how much they donate.Capping all donations to £10,000 would require state funding to fill the gap. Party membership fees will never cover what parties need to run headquarters and public meetings, recruit policy researchers, administrators, local organisers for elections and selections, conferences, leaflets and social media. Democracy relies on party volunteers, but they need professional organisers, too. Taxpayers may not like it, but put the choice to people straight: would you rather a small subvention from the state of around £100m, or in this time of power-crazed mega masters of the world’s wealth, will you leave it to the likes of Musk to buy up political parties as they buy up everything else? Few people think democracy should be up for sale, which is why a majority of the publicsupports a cap on party donations. That £100m is a tiny price to pay for politics uncontaminated by cash.Labour’s reliance on trade union funds need be no block on reform. Making all donations personal, not institutional, wouldn’t break the fundamental link between Labour and the unions that created the party. Ending unsavoury threats by unions to defund Labour would be cleansing for both. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, Labour’s biggest single donor, does her union, unions in general and the Labour party no favours when, like an old family matriarch, shethreatens to cut fundingto the party when it displeases her. Labour’s far-reaching workers’ rights bill is constantly slandered by the right as payback for union funds: it isn’t. It’s strongly supported by cabinet, party, and above all the public – but the sniff of “union paymasters” harms one of the government’s best policies.Canada limits yearly donations to $3,450 per voter. The rest of the bill is picked up by the state, which pays for 62% of the cost of running parties. That’s what clean politics looks like (though even on that low limit,campaigners protestthat donations are too swayed by the wealthy). Labour should take heed. If it makes a clean break, and goes with the grain of public opinion, it might begin to dispel public disgust with politicians wooing the rich.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This week, as Donald Trump mouthed off at the UN and told Europe it was going to hell, relief came in the form of – what else? – a man best known for his Beadle-style pranks, including painting people’s houses while they’re out and putting snakes on their backs while they’re waiting for a massage.Jimmy Kimmel, who has always struck me as the best of the late-night hosts and infinitely preferable to his late-night rival, Jimmy Fallon, nonetheless looked surprised, this week, to find himself caught in the spotlight of history.It wasDisney+boss, Bob Iger’s decision last week to suck up to Trump by indefinitely suspending Kimmel’s show, triggering uproar in the form of a popular campaign to cancel all our Disney+ memberships and – deep breath, everyone – a now-you’ve-really-done-it open letter from Hollywood actors. This one, signed by Meryl Streep, Jennifer Aniston and Tom Hanks, among others, was notable for forcefully pushing back against Trump and his cohorts – “We the peoplemust never accept government threats to our freedom of speech”– and also for failing to include George Clooney’s signature; perhaps he’s decided to sit this one out or the wifi was down at Lake Como.Anyway, no one likes being told off by icons and Iger caved, Kimmel returned, and on Tuesday night, the genial host rose to the occasion with a moment of real Voltaire-like gravity. “I want to thank the people who don’t support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” said Kimmel, a reference in part to Ted Cruz of all people, who had criticised Iger’s decision. Kimmel then landed a couple of well-timed Epstein jokes and was moved to tears by his own eloquence. In the 24 hours after it aired, 17.7 million people watched the monologue on YouTube, confirming thatthe Streisand effectis real and the quickest way to a massive audience is to tell everyone not to watch something.TuesdayHeavy emphasis was put by Kimmel on the fact that Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed head of the US broadcasting regulator, the FCC, had, by threatening the show,indulged in behaviourthat was “un-American”, a textbook accusation used by both political sides in the US that has no real equivalent in Britain.I know “British values” is a phrase used in schools and in politics. But it doesn’t have the force of “un-American” because – and it’s a hard one to put one’s finger on – in an old country without a written constitution, the loudest part is often the one no one actually articulates. Even in this climate, “British values” is a slightly embarrassing phrase likely to be used with a face doing half an apology. That’s why the whole flag thing feels so incongruous. We haven’t, historically, been a people who plant flags on our lawn as a friend suggested this week, demonstrating the unspoken snottiness that truly represents British values, it’s because unlike the Americans, we know who we are and don’t have to remind ourselves every two minutes.Anyone in doubt about this need only consider the long list of Hollywood movies with the word “American” in the title and road test them with something closer-to-home: British Beauty, British Gangster, British Sniper and, my favourite, British Psycho. Less searing drama, more spoof.View image in fullscreenEmma Watson at the Venice international film festival.Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty ImagesWednesdayMore from Hollywood this week in the form of the erstwhile Harry Potter actor Emma Watson who has come out of retirement to do a series of interviews to raise awareness about an under-researched and little reported-on condition suffered by actors who are allergic to interviews. Watson last appeared on screen in 2018 as one of the sisters inGreta Gerwig’s Little Women. Since then, she told various outlets this month, she has become “maybe the happiest and healthiest I’ve ever been”. On a two-hour podcast and in an interview with Hollywood Authentic, she talked about the “soul destroying” experience of doing publicity. During her absence from acting, she said,she missed the “art”, but not the “selling things”.I guess there are two things here. As soul-destroying aspects of a job go, it’s quite well compensated, isn’t it. And, something that has always made me laugh: the absolute conviction on the part of many actors that, while they’re having a terrible time, their interlocutors are just thrilled to meet them. I remember interviewing an actor in a restaurant in New York years ago who started complaining bitterly about how much she hated junkets. “You know none of us wants to be there, either, right?” I said, which did not trigger a moment of mutual understanding, but won me a look of pure horror.View image in fullscreen‘Yeah, it’s never actually leaving the runway’Photograph: Belinda Jiao/GettyThursdayIf you enjoyed theschadenfreudesurrounding the Observer’s Salt Path investigation, might I direct your attention to ablockbuster investigationthat just dropped in the New York Times into Amy Griffin’s bestselling memoir, The Tell. Woo-boy, it’s a corker. Griffin, who numbers Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and nerdy productivity guru Adam Grant (who gave a quote for the book jacket) among her friends, wrote an account of her childhood sexual abuse at the hands of a teacher in Amarillo, Texas, which sold to publishers for a reported $1m and has been raising eyebrows ever since.I happen to have read this book and I cannot recommend the newspaper’s extremely thorough investigation into it highly enough. For the purposes of the drama, it doesn’t hurt that Griffin lives with her hedge-fund manager husband and their children in a $77m townhouse in New York, or that she came by the memories of what happened to her after taking an MDMA pill during whatthe Times describes as“psychedelic assisted therapy” (an experimental therapy into which, writes the Times, her husband has heavily invested and awaits FDA approval). If you’re moved to read it, maybe get it from the library.FridayFinally, it’s here, the new season ofSlow Horses. And despite snarky early reviews, I won’t hear a word against it. OK, the script is slightly shonkier and Jackson’s sweary dialogue slightly more self-conscious than in earlier seasons. And the theme – masculinity is in crisis! – might poke through the first episode like something sharp through a shopping bag. But all of that misses the point about shows like Slow Horses, which can go on for ever because, like the new Downton movie, in which nothing whatsoever happens, it is enough for most of us simply to be in that world.View image in fullscreen‘That’s why I send her up first, in case the thing breaks.’Photograph: Kylie Cooper/ReutersExplore more on these topicsUS newsDigested weekSlow HorsesJimmy KimmelEmma WatsonDisney+US televisionTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Labour voters feel betrayed; anti-immigration voters see through the ruseFri 26 Sep 2025 06.59 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 12.08 EDTShareAs the Labour party gathers in Liverpool this weekend for its annual conference, everyone will be discussing one word: Reform. Nigel Farage’s party ispolling nationallyaround 13 points ahead of the Conservatives and 10 points ahead of Labour. Even in Merseyside, whose 16 constituencies used to be Labour safe seats, the party no longer seems assured. The government’s strategy for dealing with this has so far been shaped by an overwhelmingly flawed instinct: if Farage’s latest party is winning votes by talking tough on immigration, then Labour should shift rightwards too.Starmer’s “island of strangers” speechearlier this yearmarked a dramatic turn to the right on immigration. That infamous moment marked the publication of a government white paper that promised to clamp down on net migration, and blamed immigrants for overstretching public services – ignoring how chronic disinvestment has left many of those services threadbare. Farage could barely contain his delight at Labour’s new strategy. Hecongratulated Starmerfor “learning a great deal” from Reform UK. Imitation really is the greatest form of flattery.Labour is not alone in this. Across Europe, the left has repeatedly responded to the radical right byechoing their rhetoricon immigration. In Germany, the previous coalition government, led by Social Democrat Olaf Scholz as chancellor, sharply changed its rhetoric and policies on immigration and asylum as it attempted to see off Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). In the February 2025 election, the Social Democratic party received their historically worst result, securing just 16.4% of the vote, while the AfD did better than ever before, with 20.8% – an increase of more than 10% compared with the last election in 2021.As political scientists, we’ve spent years investigating what happens when mainstream parties “get tough” on immigration, and how this affects support for the radical right. Werecently studiedwhat happened to people’s assessment of Labour, and their likelihood of voting for the party or Reform, shortly after Starmer gave his island of strangers speech. The speech helpfully coincided with a period when people were answering a survey for theBritish Election Study, so we gathered responses from people who were interviewed immediately before the speech, and those interviewed immediately after. The results: the speech made Labour and Starmerlesspopular, especially among Labour’s own voters. It significantly boosted immigration as an issue in people’s minds. There is no evidence it helped to reduce support for Reform, or convince Reform voters that they should vote Labour.Recent research from Persuasion UK, a nonprofit, told much the same story. It found that Labour’smessaging around deportationsstrengthened the importance of the issue while potentiallystrengthening Reform. This is hardly unique to Labour.We studiedmore than 70 different electionsthat took place in 12 western European countries over several decades,and found that when mainstream parties take more anti-immigration positions, itleads tomoresupportfor the radical right, not less. We’vealso foundthat when social democratic parties propose strongly reducing immigration numbers, this leads to less support for social democratic parties at the ballot box.When progressive parties imitate the right, they weaken their own electoral prospects.The picture that emerges from this research is clear: moving right on immigration doesn’t helpLabour. It alienates Labour’s progressive base and fails to win over Reform voters. When Labour defines itself as a party happy to mimic those who scapegoat migrants, liberally minded voters feel betrayed. Many decide that they can no longer vote for the party. Even under first past the post, these voters will move to another party such as the Greens, or stay at home on election day.At the same time, anti-immigration voters see Labour’s pivot as inauthentic mimicry. Many of them don’t even register Labour’s rightwards shift, since Labour doesn’t fall in their list of parties that might win their vote. For them, if immigration is the defining issue, Reform or the Conservatives will always be the more credible option, no matter what Labour do.In the short term, presenting Labour as a party that’s tough on immigration is a vote-losing strategy. In the long term, it may even have the opposite effect of bolstering the success of the very party Labour seeks to outmanoeuvre. When radical-right words come from Labour mouths, the nativist and illiberal values attached to these words become increasingly normalised, shifting the boundaries of what is politically acceptable.Copying the radical right is electorally self-defeating. Social democratic parties that try this route lose their own supporters without gaining new ones, and help to legitimise their opponents in the process. It’s time for Labour to engage in some self-reflection about the type of party it wants to be. At the moment it operates as if advancing a progressive agenda and being in government are mutually exclusive. That is far from the case. It can’t beat the radical right by becoming a pale imitation of it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As its conference begins in Liverpool this weekend,the party must ask itself whether the political culture it is building is one that can inspire a country, or merely discipline it into compliance. Without a shift towards democracy, discussion and pluralism, Labour risks forfeiting the very moral and political authority it needs to confront the authoritarian voices shouting so loudly beyond our own ranks, and increasingly within them.The Corbyn wavethat swept Labour in 2015was more than just a political surge. It was a redefinition of the possible, a moment when grassroots activism, radical ideas and the audacity of political hope took centre stage. It represented a demand for genuine democracy, pluralism and change. For many, it was the first time in living memory that Labour had felt like a movement rather than a machine. Today, Starmer’s absolute determination to distance Labour from that era speaks volumes.The currentparty leadership views unity not as something cultivated through respectful dialogue and diverse perspectives, but something enforced through control. The Corbyn moment threatenedLabourprecisely because it signalled a party potentially ungovernable by conventional managerial methods. This is a party unsure how to reconcile democratic participation with electoral success.Parliamentary candidate selections have been increasingly centralised, and grassroots members and leftwing voices within the party marginalised. A party once brimming with energy, ideas and volunteers has become a professionalised bureaucracy aimed at maintaining power rather than transforming society.If Keir Starmer’s Labour can’t satisfy the unions, another party will | Andy BeckettRead moreLabour’s aversion to pluralism is most obvious in its rejection of coalition politics. It wants to be an electoral juggernaut capable of winning alone or not at all. Yet contemporary crises – climate breakdown, authoritarian populism, stark economic inequality – demand cooperation beyond narrow party lines. Collaboration between Labour, the Greens, the Liberal Democrats and other progressive forces is not a sign of weakness, but maturity. And the stakes are as high as the very future of our democracy, our planet. Such a refusal to share power becomes not just strategically foolish, but morally questionable.Nowhere is Labour’s aversion to transformative politics clearer than in its avoidance of public ownership. Consider water. Publicopinion consistently favours renationalisation– not as nostalgia, but as a pragmatic response to corporate failures, ecological crises and profound erosion of trust in privatised utilities. Refusing public ownership signals abandonment of democratic control over our collective future, showing Labour’s alignment with a neoliberal orthodoxy that has repeatedly failed.This alignment finds its starkest symbol in the party’s embrace of corporate influence. This undermines democracy itself by nourishing popular cynicism. When voters seepoliticians cosying upto the same firms thatprofited from the 2008 crash, the social contract frays further.Labour’s timidity on the climate emergency underscores this problem further. This defining crisis of our times demands bold, courageous and imaginative responses. Yet Labour’s approach has been cautious and timid, perpetually afraid of alienating swing voters or corporate backers. Net zero is framed only in terms of competitiveness, not adaptation and survival. Green investment is promised, but always secondary to fiscal rules set by an economic consensus long past its sell-by date. While floods devastate communities and air quality worsens, Labour dithers.Part of the problem is that the party is paralysed by institutional pressures and geopolitical alignments. Of course, balancing these forces is what makes for great governments and leaders. But Starmer has shown no such inclination. As prime minister, he faces substantial constraints, particularly regarding established alliances such as those with the US. Buthis careful neutrality over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and quietacquiescence to harsh immigration policiesreflect an inclination toward diplomatic continuity rather than ethical clarity or moral leadership.In this vacuum, the populist right seizes ground, offering nativist, nationalist solutions to problems that demand internationalist, ecological and equitable solidarity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not because the current Labour leadership inspires it, but in spite of it. Hope survives in the growing networks of community organisers, cooperative movements, union branches, citizen assemblies and environmental campaigns. It flourishes in places ignored by Westminster – municipal projects reclaiming public land, local councils experimenting withparticipatory budgeting, workersorganising in Amazon warehousesandUber ranks. These spaces show that politics is not the property of party elites, but of people acting in concert to change their lives.Ultimately, Starmerism risks rendering Labour unfit for the purpose it was created for: to give apolitical voice to working people and deliver collective solutions to collective problems. Openly addressing this is essential for Labour – and British politics broadly.The crisis is real, yet so too is thepotential for renewal. But that renewal cannot come from above. It must come from below – from a revitalised political culture that sees people not as voters to be harvested, but as citizens to be empowered. Recognising this is the first critical step toward a politics daring enough to imagine and urgently act upon the challenges we collectively face. And if this moment is indeed one of endings, then let it also be a moment of beginnings – a time to organise, to imagine and to build anew.Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich South.

Andy Burnham promises rupture. The choice is between Anglo-American orthodoxy and European-style interventionismFri 26 Sep 2025 13.20 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 15.50 EDTShareSir Keir Starmer’s authority is fading. His poll ratings, and Labour’s, aredisastrous. Keylieutenantsare departing. With Labour conference looming, the talk is less about governing than about whether Manchester mayor Andy Burnham ispositioninghimself for the top job. In this context, Sir Keir’s speech on Friday to fellow centre-left leaders deserves close attention. It was continuity dressed as renewal: capital behind the wheel, social policy just along for the ride.Tellingly, Sir Keir invoked “abundance” – the buzzword of American supply-side liberals and title of Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s eponymousbook. In Washington, it is the banner for centrists who pin prosperity on deregulation, rapid infrastructure rollout and market-led growth, with redistribution an afterthought. Sir Keirrebrandedit “social democracy”. This was some chutzpah: a rallying cry from a civil war inside America’s Democratic party dressed up as Britain’s progressive future.In the UK, Sir Keir argues, the political flashpoint is illegal migration. He claimed it was too easy to slip into off-the-books work and stay. But migrants in Britain already live withdigital proof of status: a nine-charactershare codehanded to employers or landlords, who verify it against a Home Office database. Sir Keir now proposes to treat British citizens the same way. Auniversal digital ID, mandatory for the right to work, is presented as protection against a shadow economy and anotherWindrush scandal.In reality, it risks laying the foundations for something more far-reaching. A consultation will consider whether including “additional information … would be helpful”. That opens the door to the Tony Blair Institute’svision: a unified digital infrastructure that can link health, welfare, housing, tax and migration records. This would be not just a work check, but a national data spine – a backbone of interoperable personal information,attractiveto Big Tech. Fights loom overgender identity, police access for protest surveillance and corporate capture. Digital identity can be built as public infrastructure, empowering citizens and protecting rights as in Estonia andDenmark. Sir Keir’s choice seems to follow the Anglo-American, not European, script.Enter Mr Burnham, sketching a different course. His “Manchesterism” sees national control of the essentials: housing, energy, transport, water. He wants prices regulated via public coordination to keep costs low. He says long-term borrowing should be used to build the social stock. He is unafraid to float another£40bnfor social housing, or to dismiss “bond vigilantes” as arbiters of affordability. On the continent this is normal politics. In Britain it marks a bracing break with the post-1980s consensus.The irony is that Sir Keir oncecampaignedon a similar programme: public ownership, higher taxes for the wealthy and a Green New Deal. One by one those promises were abandoned as high office came into view. What remains is cautious orthodoxy. Mr Burnham is offering Labour members what Sir  Keir once promised, before discarding it. That is, no doubt, why “Manchesterism” appeals to members and unsettles Downing Street. It is not nostalgia for municipal socialism, but closer to European models ofinterventionistcapitalism:taming costs directly, rather than waiting for markets to deliver. The contrast is stark. Sir Keir sells continuity. Mr Burnham’s ideas offer rupture. The question for Labour conference is which future the party wants.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But they will undoubtedly be heartfelt. A replica of the pioneering engine is to recreate the inaugural journey, with viewing tickets sold out along the route and a big screen following its progress in Darlington’s town centre. A set of commemorativestampsis being issued, which feels appropriately old school. And coming in on time, the National Railway Museum in York – a magnet for visitors from the day it opened in 1975 – isreopeningafter a multimillion-pound refurbishment.The businessmen who invested in the S&DR were motivated by the functional benefits of transporting coal more efficiently from Durham’s collieries. But their enterprise eventually unlocked far wider human possibilities, transforming perceptions of distance and changing the way the nation lived. TrainscarriedVictorian working-class families to the seaside and back, and reunited lovers on windswept platforms. Packed 20th-century commuter trains shuttled between satellite towns and cities. A railway station became part of the identity of a place, as well as a point of departure from it.These days the railways are journeying with difficulty towards a new era. The short-sightedBeechingcuts of the 1960s, and the needless, botchedprivatisationof the 1990s, were unforced political errors whose legacy is still felt today. Prohibitivefares, fragmentation, and chronicmismanagementin the north, where the story began, blight the contemporary network. HS2 remains a staggeringly expensive fiasco.As the government gradually takes more train operatorsbackunder public ownership, a much-needed strategic reboot is required. The rail industry should become a crucial driver of green sustainable growth. Sadly,reportsthat plans to extend high-speed rail across the north of England are yet again to be delayed do not inspire confidence.For train lovers though, this weekend is about the past not the future. Locomotion No 1 launched a journey which was about far more than travelling from A to B. From E Nesbit’sevocationof a rural Edwardian childhood in The Railway Children, to WH Auden’s poem,Night Mail, the trip has left its mark on our literature. Flanders and Swann memorialised lines lost to Beeching insong. Carnforth in Lancashire still celebrates its station’srolein the cinema classic Brief Encounter, where a doomed romance is brought to a close by a guard’s whistle, and the rhythmic sound of wheels beginning to move on track.Just north of Carnforth one of Britain’s great train routes begins, as the curve of Morecambe Bay permits spectacular views of vast sands and, further away, the Lakeland fells. It would be fatuous to try to name the UK’s most beautiful railway line, but there are many to choose from. Passengers (not customers) can watch the show, read a book or fire up their laptop, enjoying the freedom of being between places. The cheering Stockton crowds of 1825 were right to think they had seen the future, and that it worked.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The answer has got to be “yes”.The real question is: will the government grasp the immensity of the situation we face? It needs to urgently focus its industrial strategy on short-term transitional support for intensive users of energy like the ceramics sector, to help them towards emissions reductions targets. It also needs to work with the industry and local MPs to secure investment in research, design and skills for the long term.Next it needs to take account of the legacy costs of the heritage emergency that the closure of so many potbanks has already landed us with. All these derelict industrial sites, together with the public buildings and cultural assets that came about as a result of our local industry, need investment too.Collective efforts torescue Middleport Potteryshowed a way forward. We are grateful for the several grant programmes which are starting to emerge, but two swallows don’t make a summer. We built our city from natural resources and through the commitment of a loyal workforce. Ceramics remain essential to the national economy. In this,Stoke‑on-Trent’s centenary year, now is the time for the government to tell us how it will liaise with our MPs to bring forward a long-term strategy to ensure certainty and investment to protect output, skills and heritage buildings.Joan WalleyStoke-on-TrentOne of the reasons that ceramics prospered in the Potteries was the abundant fast-burning coal that fired the kilns that gave the city a skyline as distinctive as Manhattan. But the various clean air acts and the move away from coal broke the link between localised energy and manufacturing, and contributed hugely to the various crises that the industry has faced. It also led to most of those kilns disappearing.So what to do? One of the more obvious things would be to help the industry and the city invest in green energy production and infrastructure modernisation. There are many locations across the Potteries where green-energy production is possible – such as the former Chatterley Whitfield colliery – and this would help to re-establish that lost link between manufacturing and local energy.And those that are in the business of ceramics in the Potteries should cooperate and collaborate far more in terms of marketing. The Potteries is a world-class brand, and they should exploit it to the max. Josiah Wedgwood was a marketing pioneer, and his legacy is there to learn from. Just ask Apple executives what they think about Wedgwood.Dave ProudloveKnypersley, StaffordshireThe brand benefits of authenticity and staying true to a brand’s heritage by remaining made in England, mentioned in your leader in connection with the success of Burleigh and Emma Bridgewater, are also true for Denby pottery, which has been, and remains, made in Derbyshire for over 200 years and which has thrived in recent years, especially in Asian markets like South KoreaBut Denby, along with the entire ceramics industry across the UK, is equally being challenged for staying made in England by the lack of support so far from the government’s industrial policy. Denby continues to secure new business precisely because it is made in England, but securing the future will also need the help of government.Sebastian LazellChief executive officer, Denby GroupHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is possible with, for example, therapy and mentoring, to develop strategies that can help with symptoms.

He said: “If you are using air, and air missiles from your air fighter to shoot the drone, then you are using … [a] missile which costs 1m to kill the drone which costs 10,000.”Meanwhile, the Kremlin criticised the suggestion of shooting down Russian military planes over Europe as “reckless” and “irresponsible” after Donald Trumpsuggested alliance members should do so.0:51The moment a Russian missile strikes Dnipro in eastern Ukraine – videoAs defence talks were ongoing, a leaked proposal revealed growing momentum behind plans for a €140bn loan to Ukraine based on Russia’s frozen assets inEurope.TheEuropean Commissionbelieves it can generate a €140bn interest-free EU loan for Ukraine based on Russia’s immobilised central bank assets without confiscating the funds, according to a leaked document seen by the Guardian.While the EU alreadytakes the profits from Russian assetsfrozen in the EU to generate funds for Ukraine, the original capital remains untouched. Germany, France and Belgium have resisted plans from central and eastern European countries to seize the assets, which are largely held at theBrussels-based financial institution Euroclear.EU officials now believe they have found a legally safe way to loan Ukraine money based on the assets, predicated on the assumption thatRussiawill ultimately pay Kyiv reparations for the colossal damage inflicted during more than 1,300 days of full-scale war.In a significant move, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has swung behind such an idea, announcing via anop ed in the Financial Timeshis support for a legally secure financial instrument to secure Ukraine’s military resilience for several years.Merz said ideally the plans would be backed unanimously by the EU’s 27 member states but he suggested they could be approved by a majority, in an unspoken acknowledgment that the EU needed to consider ways to avoid a veto from Hungary’s Kremlin-friendly government.TheEU’s sanctions against Russiamust be renewed every six months, giving Budapest significant leverage, although Hungary has never blocked sanctions.EU officials also believe they have found a legal fix to avoid the unanimity requirement, meaning the cost of the loan would be ultimately paid by Russia rather than member states, which would act as guarantors.EU leaders are expected to discuss the drone wall and reparations loan at a Copenhagen summit next week with the aim of agreements by the end of October.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionDrones (military)RussiaUkraineEuropean CommissionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Neither can we accept claims of a constitutional or international right to abortion. [The declaration] exceeds the UN’s proper role while ignoring the most pressing health issues, and that’s why the United States will reject it.”There is no mention of reproductive rights or gender in the declaration except in reference to specific challenges facing women.Despite the US’s stance, the declaration is expected to be agreed on in the coming weeks. Katie Dain, the chief executive of the NCD Alliance, an NGO, said: “The unity we saw today proves that most governments are ready to take the baton on NCDs.”The declaration includes new targets to track and accelerate responses to NCDs such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, which cause43 million deaths a year– 75% of all deaths worldwide. The majority, 80%, are preventable.It also strongly urges access to affordable medicines and integrates mental health and diseases such as oral and renal conditions.Health experts criticised the failure to recommend harsher taxes on alcohol, tobacco and sugary drinks. Commitments to such levies were included in an earlier draft but were absent from the final declaration after intense lobbying by tobacco, alcohol and food and drink companies. Sugary drinks are not mentioned at all.Alison Cox, the policy and advocacy director at the NCD Alliance, said the watered-down declaration had missed an opportunity to reduce consumption of harmful products and raise much-needed funds for healthcare. Only 19 countries are on track to meet a UN goal to reduce by one-third premature mortality from NCDs by 2030 through prevention and treatment.Cox said: “We thought the moment had come. All the agreement [by governments] about investing in health protection is being lost to the interests of a few industries who are externalising the effects of their products on to economies.”Alcohol, tobacco and ultra-processed food and drink are key drivers of obesity, a major cause of NCDs. By 2035, 4 billion people will be living with overweight and obesity. AUnicef reportpublished this month found that for the first time more children around the world are obese than underweight, with low- and middle-income countries seeing the fastest rises.“These countries, where health systems, food systems, social protection systems are fragile, can least afford the problems that arise [from obesity],” Dr Joan Matji, the director of child nutrition and development at Unicef, told the WorldObesityForum in New York this week.“Everywhere children go – shops, restaurants, schools, sports event, while watching TV or scrolling social media – children are surrounded by ultra-processed foods that are cheap and aggressively marketed. We know UPFs are highly profitable, giving the food industry amazing power and influence.”Mexico, which first introduced a sugar tax in 2014,plans to increase the levyby 40%, bringing in $3.2bn a year in revenue that will go towards a health fund.The country is one of the world’s highest consumers of sugary drinks, with devastating consequences for public health: one in three Mexican children are overweight or obese, while diabetes is the nation’s second-leading cause of death, blamed for 100,000 deaths a year.Speaking at the obesity forum, Ramiro López Elizalde, Mexico’s vice-minister of health, said: “Obesity is the silent epidemic of our time. While [drinks company] executives make decisions on golf courses, millions are connected to a dialysis machine. The defenders of the soda industry say [the soda tax] is only about revenue. They are wrong. We seek to reduce consumption.“This is not just a health crisis but about social and environmental justice. The same industry that makes our children sick pollutes our rivers.

Sinclair currently owns more than 185 TV stations across 85 markets, while Nexstar owns 200 stations across 116 markets.In astatement, Sinclair said it received “thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives”.“Our objective throughout this process has been to ensure that programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience,” the firm said.The company said that it had “ongoing and constructive discussions” with ABC where Sinclair proposed measures to strengthen accountability and viewer feedback, including having a “network-wide independent ombudsman”. ABC and Disney have not agreed to the measures, and Sinclair noted that it “respects their right to make those decisions under network affiliate agreements”.Nexstar separately said: “We have had discussions with executives at [Disney] and appreciate their constructive approach to addressing our concerns.”Much of the Kimmel controversy started when Brendan Carr, chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),threatenedregulatory blowback to broadcasters if Kimmel’scommentson Charlie Kirk’s killing were not addressed.Nexstar is seeking FCC approval for amergerwith Tegna, another owner of local TV stations. The merger would require the FCC to change limits on the percentage of the national audience that it reaches, which essentially caps the number of TV stations a single company can own.Nexstar was the first to announce it would preempt Kimmel’s show, followed by Sinclair. Shortly after, ABC announced it would pause production of Kimmel’s show “indefinitely” – a hiatus that lasted almost a week, and prompted widespread criticism.On Truth Social,Donald Trumppraised ABC for taking Kimmel off the air, saying it had “the courage to do what had to be done”, before criticizing the company for reversing the decision.“I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do,” Trump wrote on Tuesday. “Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,” he said, referring to Disney’scontroversial payment to Trumpto settle a defamation lawsuit in December.After ABC announced Kimmel would come back Tuesday, Nexstar said in a statement that it would continue to evaluate the status of the show.“We are engaged in productive discussions with executives of the Walt Disney Company, with a focus on ensuring the program reflects and respects the diverse interests of the communities we serve,” it said.In recent days, Sinclair has stressed that its decision to continue preemptingJimmy KimmelLive! “was independent of any government interaction or influence”.“Free speech provides broadcasters with the right to exercise judgment as to the content on their local stations,” the company said, adding that it “is simply inconsistent to champion free speech while demanding broadcasters air specific content.”Sinclair has a history of being influential in boosting the conservative movement in recent years, includingrequiringlocal TV news anchors to read a script about “fake news” and “one-sided news stories plaguing our country”, elevating claims that Trump was making at the time during his first presidency.Explore more on these topicsJimmy KimmelDonald TrumpTrump administrationTelevision industryABCUS television industryUS televisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Speaking at the UN general assembly,Donald Trumptold global leaders – including Keir Starmer – that “all of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong”.“They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success,” the US president said. “If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”6:07Fact-checking Donald Trump’s false and misleading claims during his UN address – videoFive months ago, Starmer told an audience of world leaders and business executives, gathered in London, thatBritain would go “all out” for a low-carbon futurebecause it was “in the DNA of my government”.But now, the prime minister is facing bruising economic news and disastrous opinion polls. Banks, businesses and governments are taking Trump’s stance as a cue to quietly (or loudly, in some cases) back away from their environmental promises.Reform UKuses net zero as one of its most powerful attack lines, which is lapped up by the rightwing press.Will Starmer hold firm, or will he buckle? There are tests of his resolve in the months ahead as far-reaching policy decisions loom.The move to allow a second runway at Gatwick this weekhas prompted fears that the government may water down its policies.A wider strategy for the North Sea is expected to be confirmed, as well as an update on how £13.2bn earmarked for home insulation will be spent. Wind power contracts are due to be awarded too, with further details on airport expansions. Meanwhile, proposed regulations will set out how to build 1.5m new homes to an acceptable standard.There is also a legal deadline to be met. As the result of asuccessful high court challenge by Friends of the Earth, ministers have until 29 October to publish an overarching policy framework setting out how the government proposes to put the UK on track to meet its “carbon budgets”, the stepping stones to achieving net zero by 2050. None of these decisions will be easy, as most require investment from a cash-strapped Treasury, or taking on powerful vested interests such as the fossil fuel lobby and the housebuilding industry.View image in fullscreenFriends of the Earth campaigners protesting against the Scottish government last year.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianEnergy secretaryEd Milibandtold the Guardian that the government remains focused on the net zero target, which would be an engine of economic growth. “The clean energy mission is in the DNA of the government, because it is the opportunity of our lifetime to take control of our energy, to bring down bills, create jobs, and tackle the climate crisis,” he said.He pointed to recent measures to bolster low-carbon energy. “In just a year we’ve made the biggest investments in renewables and nuclear the country has ever seen, cut hospital and schools’ energy bills through Great BritishEnergyprojects, are ensuring new homes will have solar panels as default, and stood up for British interests on the world stage through climate action,” he said.“These are the decisions our children and grandchildren depend on us to make. We are creating growth, supporting current and future generations with good jobs in our industrial heartlands, and safeguarding our climate to protect our country and our way of life.”Observers such as Shaun Spiers, executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank, argue that net zero and climate action, far from being a drag, could be an electoral asset as Labour struggles to wrest the political momentum away from Reform.“Lowering ambition on environmental policies would be a huge own goal for this government, as they offer a decent shot at creating economic growth, making people’s lives tangibly better and ensuring we pass on a planet our children want to live on,” Spiers said. “Whether ministers choose the language of net zero, which know-nothing figures to the right of politics have made a concerted global effort to make toxic, is less important.”But there are still forces within Starmer’s government who are not convinced. Some believe that net zero, environmental protection and the overriding need to generate economic growth – on which Starmer and chancellorRachel Reeveshave staked their credibility – are, at least sometimes, in conflict.Labour is backing the expansion of Gatwick, Luton and Heathrow – but the government and industry view that aviation can grow while meeting climate commitments very much depends on the development and adoption ofsustainable aviation fuels. Moves to tear up planning regulationshave also pitted the Treasury against environmental groups, with Reeves describing concern for “bats and newts” as one of the factors holding Britain back.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves visiting Gatwick earlier this week.Photograph: Simon Walker/HM TreasuryOn the North Sea, too, Miliband is also under pressure. Labour pledged no new drilling licences for oil and gas, but the Treasury is reported to be pushing for wriggle room, such as thegranting of licences already in the system, as a way of stimulating economic growth.Tessa Khan, executive director of the campaign group Uplift, has described this as “crazy and desperate”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

There were estimated to be more than 400,000 jobs in and supported by the sector in 2014, falling to 120,000 by 2023. However, the Office for National Statistics – using a different definition – found there were only61,225 direct jobs that year, a 30% fall compared with 2015. The industryaccounts for just 0.5% of the UK’s GDP, so relying on expansion to drive broader economic growth is a pipe dream.Those economic realities do not stop Reform, and Trump, from claiming homegrown fossil fuels are needed – and with energy bills still sky-high and forcing up the cost of living, they have an audience.Thewarm homes plan, expected this autumn, should be a rebuttal to this. The fund would fix draughty homes and reduce energy waste, with grants for lower-income households. Zero-interest loans and other assistance could also help those on middle incomes install solar panels and heat pumps.“This is a historic opportunity to turn every home into a power station and end the energy bill rollercoaster. It is time to power up British homes to deliver energy independence and take back control,” according to Ed Matthew, director of the UK programme at the E3G thinktank.BP predicts higher oil and gas demand, suggesting world will not hit 2050 net zero targetRead moreBut electrifying homes and cars, with electric vehicle sales continuing to rise, may only go so far given the current system can penalise consumers. This is because electricity costs are effectively set by gas producers. The marginal price paid is determined by the most expensive producer required on the grid at any point, which often means gas-fired power stations. In addition, the cost of subsidies for green power is only added only to electricity bills, making gas for heating appear artificially cheaper by comparison. This means heat pumps, which are three times more effective than gas for heating homes and have much lower greenhouse gas emissions, aremore expensive to run than they could be.One solution could be to shift green levies into general taxation, and reform the energy market so the true cost of fossil fuels is reflected in the price paid by consumers. But this is unpalatable as Reeves will not countenance tax rises, and high gas bills are already crippling consumer budgets. The government has alsoruled out zonal pricing, which would make electricity cheaper closer to places where it is produced.Resolving this conundrum will be technically and politically tricky, but essential for the UK to fully benefit in the switch from volatile gas to homegrown renewables. Miliband has vowed to end the more blatant profiteering by gas-fired power producers, some of which have made tens of millions in profit this year for a few hours of generation.Despite the strong showing for Reform in the polls, public support for climate action remains high. Capitalising on that could be a strength for Labour if it can stand up to the vested interests of fossil fuels, dirty industries andhousebuilders, and show that lowering the cost of living and creating a cleaner, greener future are compatible, not contradictory.The fundamental principle, according to Mike Childs, policy director at Friends of the Earth, must be fairness – ensuring that the costs of changing the UK’s energy mix are borne by those most able, and that the jobs and benefits are shared widely.“Real climate action must tackle inequalities by delivering warmer homes, lower bills, cleaner air, better buses, new jobs and sustainable growth,” he said. “Get it right, and the government can blunt the attacks of climate deniers. Get it wrong, and they risk fuelling public discontent.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentClimate crisisKeir StarmerDonald TrumpNigel FarageReform UKEd MilibandanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s the best feeling, especially when you’re in a hurry,” says actor Samuel Traum, unlocking his bike by a Copenhagen intersection thronged by two-wheeled commuters. “The opposite, a red wave, is the worst.”For those of us who do not live in cycle-friendly Copenhagen, the green wave that Traum describes is a system started by the city authorities 16 years ago: in order to encourage bike travel, they synchronised traffic lights on several key roads so that a rush-hour cyclist travelling at about 20km/h (12.4mph) could catch green lights all the way.Green waves are now set to spread to 15 more routes after the municipality approved new cycling provisions in the budget this month.“The idea is nice because usually the lights are set at the speed of the cars,” says Lars, a 33-year-old analyst cycling down Nørrebrogade, where the first pilot project began. “I wish it would be expanded.”View image in fullscreenCyclists Freja Ungermand and Samuel Traum.Photograph: Ajit Niranjan/The GuardianLike many cities in Europe, Copenhagen became a city of cars after the second world war. In the 1970s, however, it began to fight back against the traffic with huge bike protests that pushed the municipality to build a vast network of cycle lanes. If every city had as many, astudyfound in June, the total carbon dioxide emissions from private vehicles would fall by 6%.‘Waste is a resource, not a nuisance’: the team who will collect and use up your leftover paintRead moreBut officials admit that even Copenhagen is struggling to cut car use among those who travel into the city from outside. The construction of cycle superhighways has helped commuters reach the outskirts by bike, but red lights slow them down when they reach the streets. It is here that transport planners hope green waves will help.“It’s so important to have the freedom on a bike to just ride along at a good speed,” says Line Barfod, the mayor for technology and environment, who zips down Nørrebrogade every day on her way to city hall and argues that more green waves will encourage people to ditch their cars. “You can feel the city wants you – and supports you – going on a bike.”The expansion of the traffic light tweak has faced little political pushback and residents who have experienced green waves speak glowingly of them. Barfod says: “The war between cars and bikes is more on parking spaces than changing speeds.”But at peak hours, local people say, Copenhagen’s cycling culture has become a victim of its own success. The lanes are too busy to enjoy an unbroken green wave, says Pia, a 65-year-old fundraiser who comes into the city by train and cycles home. “Sometimes it’s so crowded you won’t make it to the next light in time.”Lars, who usually cycles too fast to ride the wave himself, thinks the city is reaching a difficult trade-off point. “We’re at a point now where we need to choose between cars and cycles. If you give cycles more space, it will compromise with the ability of drivers to access different spaces.”Copenhagen is up against Amsterdam for the title of Europe’s cycling capital, but other big cities such as Paris and London are starting to catch up. The municipality scored poorly in arecent rankingof child-friendly cycling on the share of roads with 30km/h speed limits, though it has begun to add more.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The city has installed 19 “bicycle barometers” to understand how fast cyclists move, and – once it has a better idea of the city’s pulse – plans to time green waves to start when large numbers of bikes arrive at the start of a corridor.Such systems can improve bike traffic flow, says Gernot Sieg, a transport scientist at the University of Münster in Germany, but are not yet widespread, partly because cyclists often travel at different speeds. In some Dutch cities, such as Enschede, traffic lights have more sophisticated systems that detect incoming cyclists and prioritise them when turning green.Best of all are cycling highways that do not interact with cars at all, says Sieg. “It’s a better idea to make bike lanes where you don’t have to cross streets.”Getting people out of cars and moving their bodies is an effective way to save lives and protect the planet. About 20,000 people are killed on EU roads each year, and gains from better safety standards are being threatened by a boom in big cars thatpack more punchwhen they hit a human body.In cities, the toxic particles that vehicles spew when burning petrol and crunching tyres on tarmac have fuelled further frustration with car-centric planning.For Leena Ylä-Mononen, who moved to Copenhagen from Helsinki two years ago to lead the European Environment Agency, the city is an example of what others can achieve – even if it might seem scary. It took her five months before she dared to get on her bike and cycle down lanes packed with so many people moving so fast.“To get into the flow took me some time – but it really is the most comfortable way to move around,” says Ylä-Mononen. “Of course, it’s also because it’s a flat city with not many hills. But we have wind, so you still have to pedal hard.”Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesCycling (News)Ethical and green livingDenmarkEuropeCycling (Life and style)Road transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is the moment to lock in stronger national commitments, and the finance to deliver them, especially for adaptation [to the effects of the climate crisis]. The world is watching – and history will remember who showed up.”Other prominent figures have also privately urged Starmer – whoattended last year’s Cop29 in Azerbaijan, and as leader of the oppositionspent longer at Cop28 in Dubai in 2023than then prime minister Rishi Sunak – to attend the summit in Brazil, where countries will unveil their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade.Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and twice a UN climate envoy, said: “Cop30 in Belém this year promises to be one of the most significant climate summits in recent years. It is vital that heads of state and government attend in person to signify their commitment to climate action. Leadership must come from the top.”The UK is widely regarded as having a strong story to tell on global climate leadership, having submitted a national plan on greenhouse gas emissions cuts judged to be stronger than most other countries’ efforts.Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser to the government, said: “The attendance of world leaders on the first day of Cop30 is vital to set the trend of the meeting. A very good example is the commitment of the UK to reduce emissions by 81% by 2035, made by Starmer at the last Cop. This needs to be reiterated by the prime minister inBrazil, to persuade other countries to make similar major commitments.”A final decision has not yet been taken on the prime minister’s attendance at Cop30, which will begin with a leaders’ summit in Belem, on the mouth of the Amazon, led by Brazil’s president, Lula da Silva.Opinion polls also show strong backing across the UK for climate action, with about two thirds of people surveyed in favour. Butaccording to a report in the Financial Times, some of Starmer’s aides are fearful that Reform,whose leaders deny climate scienceandwant to scrap the net zero target, will attack the prime minister for attending.It is also not known whether King Charles will attend. Sunak attracted fierce criticism for preventing Charles from attendingCop28, against his wishes, but it would be difficult in protocol terms for the monarch to attend if the prime minister fails to.Donald Trump, the US president, will snub the summit, having dismissed the climate crisis as a “con job” in a rambling speech to the UN earlier this week.Leaders from the EU, the G7 andG20groups, and heads of state and government from scores of vulnerable countries are expected to attend the meeting, where an estimated 50,000 people will gather, and whose decisions will determine whether the world limits temperatures to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.Many of Starmer’s own MPs are concerned the prime minister would consider not going. Polly Billington, who fought off Reform to win East Thanet forLabour, and who attended Cops when she was an adviser to Ed Miliband under Gordon Brown’s premiership, said: “As someone who has been to Cops several times, I know the difference that leaders make when they attend. It focuses the minds of the negotiators on getting the best possible deal – and that is required, when we see the fragility of the consensus on acting on climate change. It is more important than ever that world leaders who understand the disastrous economic impacts of the climate crisis, and the economic opportunities of tackling it, should be there, for the world to come together.”Alex Sobel, a Labour MP who also attended Cops as a shadow minister, said: “World leaders should attend Cop30. Brazil had the highest deforestation rate under its last president, and the return of Lula shows that political leadership can make a difference, with Amazon deforestation reaching a nine-year low. After two Cops in fossil fuel producing countries, we need to show support for the UN process, and what can be achieved with the right political leadership.”Zack Polanski, the leader of the Green party, said not to go would show Starmer’s lack of commitment to tackling the climate crisis.“This would be a huge abdication of responsibility,” he said. “If you accept there is a climate emergency, you need to act as such. And the first thing you need to do is build an international consensus on the response. The very least the prime minister could and should do is turn up. Instead, Starmer’s missing in action at this time of crisis and frankly that speaks volumes.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Sign up hereGraham ReadfearnFri 26 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareLots of us around the world probably need just a little joy mixed in with the ever-troubling biodiversity and climate crises.Here in Australia, we’ve found a way to mix our conservation concerns with a bit of healthy competition and a lot of joy. It’sour bird of the year poll, and anyone can vote, no matter where you are in the world.But before all that, here are the most important reads from the past week.Essential readsFossil fuel burning poses threat to health of 1.6bn people, data shows‘A defining moment’: Trinidad and Tobago at a crossroads as oil runs outHow Bill Gates is playing both sides of the climate crisis – videoIn focusView image in fullscreenThe red goshawk – Australia’s rarest bird of prey, and a contender in this year’s bird of the year poll.Photograph: Trade CreativeThe red goshawk’s deep, powerful wings emit a faint thrum as it accelerates under the canopy towards its prey. Rainbow lorikeets are no slouches, but they’re no match for the speed and agility of Australia’s rarest bird of prey, which banks and swoops like a feathery fighter jet. But this spectacle – once seen all the way down Australia’s east coast – is disappearing.As researcher Chris MacColl told me, it is going extinct “right under our noses” and now only perhaps a thousand of them, and maybe fewer, are left across Australia’s far northern tropical savannahs.The red goshawk is just one of a host of stories we’ll be telling over the next two weeks as we gear up forour bird of the year poll– an event Guardian Australia runs every two years in partnership with BirdLife Australia.We’ll also look at the plight of Baudin’s black cockatoo, the southern emu wren and the beleaguered orange-bellied parrot. We’ve already published pieces on how the glossy black cockatoois losing its treesand how the climate crisisthreatens the mighty albatross.Bird of the year gives us a chance to highlight Australia’s incredible diversity of birds – we have about 850 native species, and nearly half of them are found nowhere else on the planet. The most often-sighted bird across the continent is not a drab pigeon (sorry, pigeons) but the ridiculously colourful rainbow lorikeet.But it’s also about something else. With all the bad stuff going on in the world, it’s more important than ever to find some joy and to make time to be grateful for the amazing things around us (being consciously gratefulis brilliant for our mental health).Right now, we are going through thousands of reader nominations for species that will make it into our final 50, ahead of 10 days of frantic online voting starting on 6 October. Nominations such as the currawong, which one reader told us greets an entire street with its song at sunset; the magpie, known for swooping to protect springtime nests but “spends the rest of the year just being great”; or the tawny frogmouth: “Look at it, it’s awesome.” Amen to that.Anyone, anywhere in the world, can vote – and people do in their many thousands. When we last ran the competition we got about 321,000 votes. That’s 321,000 times people were not thinking about terrible things, but were instead weighing up the merits of the superb fairywren (a former winner, so named because they’re superb) against the spotted pardalote (someone should call them the Zoolander bird because they’re ridiculously good looking) or the bin chicken (also known as the Australian white ibis).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Concluding the reasons forhis decision, he said: “I find that these proceedings were not instituted in the correct form, lacking the necessary DPP [director of public prosecutions] and AG [attorney general] consent within the six-month statutory time limit set by section 127.“The time limit requires consent to have been granted at the time or before the issue of the requisition. Consequently the charge is unlawful and null and this court has no jurisdiction to try the charge.”Michael Bisgrove, for the prosecution, previously told a court that permission from the director of public prosecutions and attorney general was not required until the defendant’s first court appearance and that permission did not need to be sought in order to bring a criminal charge.The chief magistrate dismissed the arguments, telling the court they “defy logic”.There were loud cheers from the public gallery as the chief magistrate handed down his judgment. Ó hAnnaidh smiled and gave a thumbs up sign to his supporters.The Crown Prosecution Service said it was “reviewing the decision of the court carefully”. It said the decision could be appealed.Dozens of Ó hAnnaidh’s supporters, who had gathered outside the court, cheered as the decision was relayed to the crowd. Some waved Palestine and Irish flags. Others held aloft placards that read Free Mo Chara, referencing the rapper’s stage name.Ó hAnnaidh, who is referred to by his anglicised name Liam O’Hanna in court documents, arrived at court wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh, a balaclava in the colours of the Irish tricolour and sunglasses.After walking out of the court he told supporters: “This entire process was never about me. It was never about any threat to the public, it was never about terrorism – a word used by your government to discredit people you oppress.“It was always about Gaza, about what happens if you dare to speak up.”He added: “Your attempts to silence us have failed because we’re right and you’re wrong. We will not be silent. We said we would fight you in your court and we would win. Today, we have. If anyone on this planet is guilty of terrorism, it’s the British state. Free Palestine.”The West Belfast MP Paul Maskey, who attended court on Friday, said the decision not to proceed with the trial was the right one. “Kneecap have bravely and unapologetically used their platform around the world to call out Israel’s genocide and the complicity of western governments,” the Sinn Féin politician said.“It is the Israeli war criminals and those who fund, support and enable genocide and forcibly starve women and children who should be before the courts, not Kneecap’s Mo Chara. The British political assault on Kneecap which led to this case has failed. Today, those on the right side of history have prevailed.”Kneecap’s manager, Daniel Lambert, wrote on X: “We have won!!!!!! Liam Og is a free man. We said we would fight them and win. We did (Twice). Kneecap has NO charges OR convictions in ANY country, EVER. Political policing has failed. Kneecap is on the right side of history. Britain is not. Free Palestine.”Lambert said he was not surprised the case was thrown out and that the group will not change “anything they do”.Asked if he has a message for Keir Starmer, O hAnnaidh said: “Better luck next time.”Northern Ireland’s first minister, Michelle O’Neill, welcomed the decision. In apost on X, she said: “All charges have been dropped against Kneecap’s Mo Chara. I strongly welcome this decision. These charges were part of a calculated attempt to silence those who stand up and speak out against the Israeli genocide in Gaza.“Kneecap have used their platform on stages across the world to expose this genocide, and it is the responsibility of all of us to continue speaking out and standing against injustice in Palestine.”Explore more on these topicsKneecapUK security and counter-terrorismNorthern IrelandIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

He had spent some of his final days watching last weekend’s Lib Dem conference, the family said.Before becoming a politician, Campbell was a senior barrister. As a young man he had been an elite sprinter, competing for Great Britain in the 1964 Olympics, and holding the UK record for 100 metres for seven years.Lord Campbell of Pittenweem obituaryRead moreCampbell, who was MP for North East Fife for 27 years, lasted just 18 months as party leader, taking the role in 2006 after Charles Kennedy stepped down suddenly, saying he was being treated for alcoholism.He had a sometimes difficult period as leader and there was speculation about a challenge when it appeared that Gordon Brown was about to call an election in 2007.While the election did not happen, Campbell resigned, saying: “Questions about leadership are getting in the way of further progress by the party.”Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said Campbell was “a dedicated public servant, a tireless champion for Fife, St Andrews and the UK, and a true Liberal giant”.He said: “He was the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on foreign affairs when the world changed on 9/11 and his principled leadership opposing the Iraq war was a mark of his morality, courage and wisdom. He spoke up for what was right, even when it was hard.”Tony Blair called Campbell “one of the most honourable and decent people in politics, liked and respected across the political spectrum”, with the former prime minister saying he was “a colleague you could trust and work with”.Brown said Campbell “was a polymath – a British Olympic athlete, a well-known advocate at the Scottish bar who will be remembered most as a popular member of parliament and Liberal leader who specialised in Scottish affairs.View image in fullscreenCampbell, right, with Charles Kennedy and Nick Clegg, centre, in November 2011.Photograph: Alan Davidson/Shutterstock“I remember him as a fellow Fife MP and a friend who was always great to work with cross-party lines, who shared a strong sense of social justice and a belief in international cooperation. He will be remembered too for his kindness and humanity, always generous to other people, always considerate in giving his advice and in listening to the advice of others.”Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said that while she was not in the Commons at the same time as Campbell, “he always stood out as a man of principle, integrity and great commitment to our country. Politics is poorer for his loss”.Campbell studied law at Glasgow University, later attending Stanford in the US. As an athlete he held the UK record for the 100 metres with a time of 10.2 seconds, a mark set in 1967 that stood until 1974.Competing at the 1964 Tokyo Games, Campbell, then aged 23, took part in the 200 metres, reaching the quarter-finals, and the 4x100-metre relay, where the team got to the final.While at Stanford, he raced against and beat OJ Simpson, who had a college athletics career before turning to American football. On one of these occasions, Campbell finished second to Tommie Smith, the US athlete who won the 200 metres at the 1968 Olympics and famously gave a black power salute from the podium.Campbell recounted the experience in an interview with a Scottish newspaper. “I’d had a very good indoor season.

Trump said last month that he would not spend the money, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.The justice department sought the supreme court’s intervention after US district judge Amir Ali ruled that Trump’s action was likely illegal and that Congress would have to approve the decision to withhold the funding.The federal appeals court in Washington declined to put Ali’s ruling on hold, but John Roberts, the chief justice, temporarily blocked it on 9 September. The full court indefinitely extended Roberts’ order.The court has previously cleared the way for theTrump administrationto strip legal protections from hundreds of thousands of migrants, fire thousands of federal employees, oust transgender members of the military and remove the heads of independent government agencies.The legal victories, while not final rulings, all have come through emergency appeals, used sparingly under previous presidencies, to fast-track cases to the supreme court, where decisions are often handed down with no explanation.Trump told House speaker Mike Johnson in a 28 August letter that he would not spend $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.He used what’s known as a pocket rescission. That’s a rarely used maneuver when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. The late notice essentially flips the script. Under federal law,Congress has to approve the rescission within 45 days or the money must be spent. But the budget year will end before the 45-day window closes, and in this situation the White House is asserting that congressional inaction allows it to not spend the money.The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as people lose access to food supplies and development programs.Justice department lawyers told a federal judge last month that another $6.5bn in aid that had been subject to the freeze would be spent before the end of the fiscal year next Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS supreme courtUS politicsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Despite the denials of Labour and nothing-to-see-here Keir, it is clear that the prime minister’s chief of staff still has very serious questions to answer.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Launched in 2015 after Labour’s election defeat under Ed Miliband, it relaunched in 2017 under the leadership of McSweeney as a vehicle for wresting control of the party from Jeremy Corbyn and persuading centrist MPs not to break away from the party.McSweeney left his role at Labour Together in April 2020 to become a senior aide to Starmer in opposition and then in government.An Electoral Commission spokesperson said: “We have thoroughly reviewed this information and found no evidence of any other potential offences. We are confident that the initial determination and sanction were appropriate. We are therefore not reopening the investigation.”The spokesperson said Labour Together’s fine in 2021 had been “significant” and reflected “the seriousness of the offences determined, for which no reasonable excuse was put forward”.Labour Together said it welcomed the decision and highlighted the fact it had proactively raised concerns about the failure to declare donations in 2020. “Since then, we have taken measures to ensure Labour Together is fully compliant with all Electoral Commission regulations,” it said.Explore more on these topicsMorgan McSweeneyElectoral CommissionLabourKeir StarmerThinktanksnewsShareReuse this content"

Rubin was expected to be arraigned later Friday.Messages for comment were sent to multiple lawyers for both of them.During a three-decade career, Rubin worked at various financial firms, including Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns and Soros Fund Management.Prosecutors said Rubin and Powers abused the women between 2009 and 2019 after recruiting them to fly to New York to engage in sex acts with Rubin in exchange for money.They said Rubin and Powers targeted women who were desperate, including women who had previously been sexually abused, along with women who were financially desperate or who suffered from addiction. Once they were in New York, the women were encouraged to use drugs or alcohol to prepare for their sexual encounters, and they sometimes engaged in conduct beyond the scope of their consent, prosecutors said.During the encounters, women suffered significant pain, including bruises and psychological trauma, and sometimes required medical treatment, according to court papers.Rubin and Powers spent more than $1m of Rubin’s money to recruit the women to participate in commercial sex acts involving bondage, discipline, dominance, submission and sadomasochism, according to a letter submitted to a federal judge in which prosecutors sought detention for Rubin and a significant bail package for Powers.Prior to 2011, the commercial acts usually occurred at luxury hotels in Manhattan, but from 2011 to 2017, the encounters usually occurred in a two-bedroom penthouse near Central Park, the letter said.The penthouse contained “The Dungeon”, a soundproofed room painted red that had a lock on the door and was outfitted with bondage and discipline instruments, prosecutors said.They said Powers maintained the dungeon, cleaned it between uses and restocked the equipment, while also recruiting women, arranging their flights and managing fallout from complaints about the sessions with Rubin.Rubin and Powers required the women to sign non-disclosure agreements and pledge that they were not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when they signed the agreements, prosecutors said.According to court papers, Rubin has funded virtually all aspects of Powers and her family’s lifestyle since 2012, including rent on their Manhattan apartment; her children’s private school tuition; and the down payment and mortgage on their Texas-based home after the Powers’ moved toTexasin 2020.Prosecutors said Rubin and Powers were sued for civil sex trafficking in November 2017, but a jury found at trial that they were not liable. The case has been appealed.If convicted, Rubin and Powers each face a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison and a maximum of life.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

In August the Guardian revealed that almost one in 10 of the fastest-growing YouTube channels globally wereshowing AI-generated content only.AI-generated content has become an increasingly prominent feature on consumers’ feeds as the underlying technology has become more sophisticated, with the release of Google’s Veo3 model in May creating a new wave of content, although film-makers are already using the models to createhigh-quality material as well.Meta owns Facebook and Instagram, and Zuckerberg said in an Instagram post that Vibes would be a “feed of expressive AI-generated videos from artists and creators”. The feed will be available in the US and in more than 40 other countries but not in the UK.Zuckerberg illustrated the post with an AI-made clip titled “Dad trying to calculate the tip on a $30 lunch”, with a parent – bearing a resemblance to Zuckerberg – stating: “Oh gosh … I think it’s probably to going to be, I dunno, at least $600bn.” One Instagram user commented under Zuckerberg’s video: “Bros posting ai slop on his own app.”Other videos posted by Zuckerberg include an Egyptian princess taking a selfie, a kitten wearing bespoke baker garb kneading dough, cute fluffy characters and a dog running through a waterlogged field.In a statement announcing the Vibes feed, Meta said users can create their own content or “remix” a video from the feed, including new visuals and music. Meta illustrated the statement with videos including aHoney Monster-like cuddly creature riding a bicycle and a moose jumping on a trampoline.Although Meta has its own suite of AI models, called Llama, for Vibes it will be using video-generating models from the AI labs Midjourney and Black Forest, according to apost on Threadsfrom Meta’s new chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Calling the men “brave soldiers”, he said a review panel had concluded in a report that the medals were justly awarded. “This decision is now final, and their place in our nation’s history is no longer up for debate.”Hegseth’s Democratic predecessor at the Pentagon, former defense secretary Lloyd Austin, ordered the review of the honors in 2024 after Congress called for it in the 2022 defense bill. Announcing the review, the Pentagon said Austin wanted to “ensure no awardees were recognized for conduct inconsistent with the nation’s highest military honor”.But in Thursday’s video, Hegseth – who has a history of Christian nationalist sympathies – said his predecessor had been “more interested in being politically correct than historically correct”. It is unclear if the report will be made public.Hegseth’s move also halts a push from Democratic lawmakers to revoke medals tied to the massacre at a camp on what is now the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. ForNative Americans, the massacre marked a devastating climax to the tragedy of Indigenous removals from their land.“We cannot be a country that celebrates and rewards horrifying acts of violence against Native people,” senator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement earlier this year after reintroducing the proposed Remove the Stain Act.After the massacre, 19 soldiers from the seventh cavalry were awarded the Medal of Honor for their “bravery” and “gallantry” over actions ranging from rescuing fellow troops to efforts to “dislodge Sioux Indians” hiding in a ravine.Native Americans have long pushed for revocation of the medals. As time has gone on,the isolated sitehas become a place of mourning for many tribes, symbolizing the genocidal history of brutality and repression they have suffered at the hands of the US government. While Congress issued a formal apology in 1990 to the descendants of the massacre, the medals were left in place and no reparations offered.Thursday’s announcement is the latest move to sanitize the nation’s history taken by the Trump administration since Donald Trump signed an executiveorderin March titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”.In recent months, Hegseth hasrevertedthe names of several US army bases back to Confederate-linked names,monumentsto the Confederacy and Confederate figures have been restored, and herenameda US navy ship that honored gay rights activist Harvey Milk.The Trump administration has also gone after cultural institutions likeSmithsonian museumsfor exhibits it considers “unpatriotic”, purged and rewritten federalwebpagesrelated to topics including slavery, diversity and discrimination (some of which were laterrestored), and cut funding to grants toinstitutionsthat honor the lives of enslaved people.Some historians took to social media to denounce the administration’s latest move.“Only an administration intent on committing war crimes in the present and future would stoop to calling Wounded Knee a ‘battle’ rather than what it truly was,” Columbia University history professor Karl Jacobypostedon Bluesky.Jacoby added: “Fortunately, history does not work as Hegseth seems to believe. It is never “settled” and the government cannot (at least for now!) impose its interpretation of events on the rest of us.”Explore more on these topicsPete HegsethTrump administrationUS militaryUS politicsIndigenous peoplesNative AmericansSouth DakotanewsShareReuse this content"

Now, its writer and star is back to break the rules all over againFri 26 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 09.01 EDTShareThere’s a scene in the new series of Dreaming Whilst Black that truly nails the feeling of wanting the ground to open up and swallow you whole. After grinding it out as a recruitment consultant and a takeaway driver, struggling film-maker Kwabena has finally landed his first TV job, directing a prestigious period drama titled Sin and Subterfuge. It’s a gruelling gig, and the fact that the lead role has been given to a ditzy reality star with no acting experience proves to be the least of his worries. Under pressure to make a stationary carriage in front of a green screen look as though it’s actually moving, he instructs the crew to grab “leaves, branches, anything you can from outside … any forms of foliage!” and wave them in front of the camera while vigorously shaking the vehicle. Screws begin to fly in all directions – and you get the sense that Kwabena’s television career is just as unsteady.Gladly, Adjani Salmon, who plays Kwabena and is also the co-creator and writer of the acclaimed comedy, is having a bit more luck. The first series of Dreaming Whilst Black was praised by critics as a sharp and surreal take on Black British life, with comparisons made to US series such as Atlanta and Insecure. For Salmon, though, some of the highest praise came from hearing that clips were being shared by Caribbean and African “aunties” in their group chats.View image in fullscreenAbsolute scenes … Adjani Salmon and Babirye Bukilwa in the new series of Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: Gary Moyes/BBC/A24Series two – due this autumn – is both funnier and more twisted, as Kwabena moves from desperate outsider to an insider with the odds still vastly stacked against him, as the making of Sin and Subterfuge descends into chaos (truly, “carriagegate” is just the tip of the iceberg). As for the foliage scene, it’s a neat – if apparently unintentional – callback to Salmon’s own career. When he, too, was toiling to get his big break in the arts, he worked as a labourer at Pinewood’s “greens” department, travelling two and a half hours each day from his aunt’s house in north London to the film studios in Buckinghamshire. There, he would fashion plants and earth into verdant sets for films such as Disney’s 2016 live-action version of The Jungle Book. “The first job I did, they pushed the shoot back, so the leaves died on all the trees,” says Salmon. “We had to spray paint them green …”Despite his mammoth Perspex sunglasses and the pile of swag bags he’s toting from an earlier PR event, when we meet at his agent’s Soho HQ it’s clear that the 36-year-old still has his feet very much on the ground. Warm and high-spirited, he is unguarded when it comes to the obstacles he’s overcome – many of which he’s channelled into the series.Do you play their game and just make money for yourself? Or do you try to uplift your people?Born in England and raised in Jamaica (his accent tends towards British in the series, but is dotted with Patois in real life), he initially studied architecture in the UK before turning his hand to video editing, working on shows such as Mission Catwalk, the Caribbean equivalent of Project Runway. After an MA in directing back in London, opportunities failed to materialise, leading Salmon and a group of friends to create a webseries in which he played a young film-maker struggling to get a foothold in the industry. This was, after all, the golden age of the webseries; among his inspirations was Awkward Black Girl, Issa Rae’s brilliant DIY precursor to Insecure.Salmon’s own webseries was released in 2018, and accepted for a number of film festivals – including one in Rio de Janeiro. Salmon had just £500 to his name, the same amount that the flights would cost. “If I drop this £500 I’m going to zero, and I’ll have to do the whole trip in my overdraft,” he recalls. He went to the festival’s awards evening nonetheless – and recalls hearing the names of other rival series being read out, again and again. “Being nominated isnota ting!” he says with a belly laugh. “Being a winner is the ting”. Just when he was beginning to lose all hope, his series began to win award after award. “I was pouring my heart out on stage [during my speeches], like, ‘I borrowed money for this shit! Man, you don’t know how much this means to me!’” The team ended up winning best international series and, almost eerily, a cash prize of £500.The TV pilot of Dreaming Whilst Black was released in 2021 and by the time it was commissioned by the BBC for a full series – with US indie powerhouse A24 extending its Midas touch alongside original producers Big Deal – Salmon had already nabbed both a Bafta for emerging talent and a RoyalTelevisionSociety award. He and his collaborators, he says, had “no idea how to make our show”, but perhaps that was what made it work. Certainly, the end result was like nothing else on TV in 2023, a series that was as likely to feature a parody of a UK government video about the benefits of the British empire as it was a bus-stop meet-cute between Kwabena and love interest Vanessa (Babirye Bukilwa).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

And they’re the crazy ones.”He is also at pains to explain that the conceit is more nuanced than just a Black man being exploited by powerful white people, instead hinging on the “complexity of what it means to be Black in the industry – do you fit in and play their game and just make money for yourself? Or do you try to uplift your people?” It’s an often impossible choice, and one he doesn’t judge people for getting wrong. Indeed, series one ended with Kwabena ditching his idea for a Windrush-era romance in favour of making a short film about his cousin’s arrest on drug charges, which prompted his acerbic uncle Claude to accuse him of exploiting his family to further his career.Season two brings with it more badmouthing from Claude and even more complexity, as a newly agented Kwabena finds himself being put forward for jobs on shows such as “Black Love: a sweeping romcom torn apart by a violent stabbing at Notting Hill carnival”. As he strives to work with a high-powered Black female producer, he also begins to wonder whether – to misquote Zora Neale Hurston – all skinfolk in the TV industry are really kinfolk. Elsewhere, he finds a rival in film-maker Tinashe (Kayode Ewumi), who brings out the worst in him. “It’s important that we show flaws in Kwabena, too,” says Salmon, “and that actually, he’s a bit of a dick!”View image in fullscreenConsomme professional … Adjani Salmon in Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: Gary Moyes/BBC/Big Deal FilmsIt also considers the limitations of colourblind casting, and what can go wrong when a Black actor finds themselves playing a character who was originally written to be white (and in this case, written to be aslave-ownerto boot). The practice has somewhat been abandoned in favour of “colour conscious” roles, which pay homage in part to an actor’s ethnicity, but still persists in some productions, such as the Wolf Hall adaptation The Mirror and the Light. As well as cocking a snook at the laziness that can occasionally explain such decisions, Salmon says he wanted to show how, even if “somebody [like Kwabena] has good intentions, if the system you’re in doesn’t have them, it hard fi’ come out the other side with a product that feels cared for”.If there is a show that feels cared for, though, it is Dreaming Whilst Black. Key to this is a lightness of touch that seems to extend off screen. A short walk from his agent’s office, in Soho’s maze of post-production houses, I observe Salmon as he watches back a few particularly hysterical scenes, including one where Kwabena launches into an R&B song in the middle of a fancy restaurant before washing his hands in a bowl of consomme. Salmon asks the editor to bring his voice down a little in the mix, to make it seem a little less like he’s belting, while everyone in the room – directors, publicists, producers – roars at the scene.The show’s Regency-inspired shoots–complete with dream sequences where Kwabena and Vanessa enjoy their own period romance–were equally amusing, says Salmon. “It almost felt like everybody was Kwabena,” he laughs. “Because we were scrambling to film all of this stuff in a house that we can only afford for three days.” He relished the chance to see what costume designer Jodie-Simone Howe and makeup designer Cynthia De La Rosa could do when it came to putting a Caribbean spin on period style, too. And from a traditional red plaid Jamaican bandana reimagined as a waistcoat to Salmon’s freeform locs coaxed into the shape of a stiff, powdered wig, the looks are all totally delightful to see imagined on screen. As well as its very meta critiques and send-ups of the entertainment world, many of the lighter parts of Dreaming Whilst Black come from its stories about family and relationships. This time around, that means a plot involving the later-in-life romance between Kwabena’s mum, Grace, played by Jo Martin, and her plumber, Errol. It was, says Salmon, “almost an ode to my mom, or my aunts. I’m glad that we could do a storyline for them.”As Salmon gets ready to record some additional dialogue for the show, we chat about his other projects – among them a family sitcom and an intriguing-sounding dystopian political drama. And, perhaps, more Dreaming Whilst Black, which ends on a big old cliffhanger. “We’dloveto do this again. If we end the series here, the message would be dark! So for everybody’s sake, I hope we get to do it one more time.” One thing’s for sure: he’ll be back in the Aunties’ WhatsApp groups before he knows it.Dreaming Whilst Black returns to BBC Three 10pm, 9 October.

Doja Cat’s new album is titled Vie – French for “life” – andthe original artwork(changed at the last minute) features the 29-year-old Angeleno surrounded by roses, ever the picture of congeniality. Doja has become known, in recent years, as mainstream pop’s master agitator: she tells her superfans to “get off your phone, get a job and help your parents with the house”, disavows her own hits before they’ve even left the upper echelons of the charts and is totally unapologetic about what can be described, charitably, asedgelord behaviour. Doja’s 2023 album Scarlet – a prickly, antagonistic record designed to prove her bona fides as a rapper – seemingly shut the book on her time as a pop hit-maker with a bracing, refreshing meanness.View image in fullscreenThe (new) artwork for Vie.Photograph: APSo there is precedent for the notion that Vie’s lead single Jealous Type – a piece of slick, cinematic 80s pop of the kind Doja used to toss off with abandon – was a fake-out. It’s not exactly that: Doja’s fifth album does find her returning to the sugary, aerodynamic well of her 2019 LP Hot Pink and 2021’s Planet Her. This time around, it feels as if she and producer Jack Antonoff have found a more comfortable middle ground between the gloss of that world, which she’s criticised over and over again, and the desires of the brilliantly snarky fire-starter who tore her way through Scarlet.Hearing the push-and-pull between those sides of Doja is enormous fun. AAAHH MEN! is like a sinister take on Chic’s Le Freak, its blown-out, sleazy strut a perfect soundtrack for Doja’s conflicted internal monologue: do I want to take a guy home for sex, or just to lambast him? It’s hard to tell which she’s leaning towards: “I have too much tolerance / You ugly and fine as shit / And if I had more common sense / Then I would grab my ride and dip,” she raps, clearly relishing the opportunity to trifle.Doja Cat: Gorgeous –video‘It’s like, wow. I was really deranged’: stars and repentant stans on the terror of toxic fandomRead moreMore often, it’s a sweeter side of Doja taking hold, although rarely the uncomplicated sexpot of early singles such as Say So. On Silly! Fun! she raps with flustered abandon about being in love for the first time over the kind of dazed, lovesick production that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Chappell Roan record. When she raps “I’m inlove” or “let’s havekids,” the final word of each phrase is sung by a disembodied backing vocal, like she wouldn’t dare say it out loud – a charming, canny detail. Doja has said she probably wouldn’t listen to this music herself, but she’s locked in nonetheless, applying the same detail to frothy pop songs as she does to one-liners such as: “He ain’t hungry for money / I told him: ‘Come eat the rich.’” (See seventh track All Mine.)Can a leopard change its spots? That seems to be the question Doja is trying to answer musically and lyrically across Vie. She is smart enough not to give any clear answers, ending the album with Come Back, a glowing, bitter love song that shares a strand of its DNA with Donna Lewis’s I Love You Always Forever. “I’m pleased I ain’t the bitch you was hopin’ for / If we keep this up and you hold my doors / And you take my bag, and you hold me more / I don’t think that would make up for the hope I lost,” she raps, weariness coating every inch of her voice. There’s no trolling here – just an earnest relationship postmortem, set to production that’s so twinkly and lovesick it would make even Carly Rae Jepsen blush. A leopard can’t change its spots, but maybeDoja Catcan.Explore more on these topicsMusicDoja CatPop and rockRapalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Yes, happy One Battle After Another release day to all who celebrate.For card-carrying members of the tribe (and I’m absolutely one of them), the arrival of a newPaul Thomas Andersonfilm is an event equal in magnitude to Christmas Day meets the World Cup final meets McDonald’s bringing back the McRib. PTA – as the heads call him – may not be the most famous director of his age (Spielberg, Cameron, Scorsese, Nolan and even namesake Wes Anderson are more recognisable to the average filmgoer), but he is surely the most adored among his fans, a film-maker incapable of making a bad film.Anderson advocates would whip themselves into a lather over the most minor of his releases (a Haim music video, say, or adocumentary short about Rajasthani jam bands), but One Battle After Another is far from minor. Adapted (extremely loosely) from the Thomas Pynchon novel Vineland, it stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a former far-left revolutionary turned schlubby dad trying to protect his daughter from a psychotic colonel (Sean Penn, in his best performance in God knows how long) willing to unleash the full force of the military on the Mexican border sanctuary city in which father and daughter are laying low. That description barely scratches the surface of a film that features surreal racist political sects, machine-gun-toting pregnant bank robbers, and Benicio del Toro as a brilliantly unflappable smuggler-slash-sensei. It’s a hell of a ride: ambitious, funny, scary, and poignant in parts. The PTA crew are going to love it – and I suspect plenty of others will too.At odds with the fervour of PTA fans is another no less cultish group: Oscar voters. Historically, that tribe has been far less receptive to the director’s charms – downright frosty, in fact. To date, the Academy Awards tally for PTA personally reads as follows: 11 nominations across best picture, director, adapted screenplay and original screenplay … and a whopping great zero wins. No matter what he throws at them – sprawling, multi-character puzzle pieces (Boogie Nights, Magnolia), dark American epics (There Will Be Blood, The Master), stoner head-scratchers (Inherent Vice), elegant mid-century melodramas (Phantom Thread), broad coming-of-age comedies (Licorice Pizza) – they remain unmoved.View image in fullscreenFervent fans … Paul Thomas Anderson at a One Battle After Another event in Mexico City this month.Photograph: Victor Chavez/ShutterstockIt’s a record that, if anything, burnishes PTA’s reputation even further among his acolytes. They’ll say: “These are the clowns who picked Forrest Gump over Pulp Fiction, Crash over Brokeback Mountain. Well, of course they wouldn’t recognise a generational director.” That said, you can almost, if you squint hard enough, half understand the thinking behind their snubs. Anderson’s films, with their off-kilter rhythms, morally ambiguous characters, bursts of surreal humour, clattering Jonny Greenwood scores, and interest in awkward subjects (the porn industry in Boogie Nights, Scientology in The Master), are a difficult-to-digest proposition for, in particular, the Academy’s more conservative wing. Though, in fairness, sometimes PTA has just suffered pure bad luck: There Will Be Blood would surely have won in 2008 were it not for the Coens delivering their own modern classic that year in No Country for Old Men.This time though feels different. One Battle, while clearly a Paul Thomas Anderson film in tone, style and preoccupations, is also a big, swing-for-the-fences crowd-pleaser of the kind he’s never really made before, with explosions, car chases, a bankable leading man ($7.2bn and counting at the box office for DiCaprio). You leave the cinema grinning and giddy after seeing it. And, in contrast to his past films, nearly all of which are set in the recent or semi-distant past, One Battle is thrillingly, chillingly of the moment, with its scenes of military forces camped out on American streets and shadowy far-right cabals that skirt the line between hilarity, in their pomposity and fustiness, and outright horror. Relevant and raucous, it’s a film that almost seems to force the Academy’s hand: what else could they possibly ask for? Certainly, the oddsmakers seem to think that’s the case, having pretty much already declared the best picture race over.And, of course, there’s another even more potent force behind PTA this time around: the feeling it’s “his time”. The momentum behind an “overdue” nominee is often unstoppable, regardless of the quality of the thing they’re nominated for. Perhaps the most famous recent example, and one that Anderson and One Battle After Another are being compared to, is Scorsese – after the driest of dry streaks – winning best picture and director for The Departed, an extremely fun film that nevertheless is considered one of the lesser works in his filmography.So, is that it? Best picture, director, and plenty more Oscars besides already locked up six months before the ceremony? Of course not. After all, “it’s their time” only gets you so far – just askpoor old Glenn Close. And there are plenty of other widely admired films in contention – Chloé Zhao’sapparently devastating Hamnet, starring Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley, or Joachim Trier’s much buzzed-about Worst Person In the World follow-up Sentimental Value, or Kathryn Bigelow’s also extremely timely nuclear war thriller A House of Dynamite. Or even Sinners – as well as being much admired by, well, everyone, it did extraordinarily well at the box office, while some are concerned that One Battle may struggle to lure in cinemagoers. Warner Bros, which made both Sinners and PTA’s film, may have to make a tricky choice over which film to put its heft behind when it comes to awards season campaigning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It centres on Russ Holliday (Glen Powell), a superstar quarterback whose career falls apart after a spectacular, self-inflicted on-field disaster. His name is mud but when he learns that a struggling team (the tellingly named South Georgia Catfish) are hosting tryouts for new players, he changes identity and relaunches himself as Chad Powers. The premise is contrived – Russ’s dad, conveniently, is a prosthetics artist – and the narrative overfamiliar. But even so, as Holliday’s new personality sees him shedding his arrogance and becoming a more reflective man, there’s fun to be had with this goofball identity crisis.Disney+, from Tuesday30 SeptemberMonster: The Ed Gein StoryView image in fullscreenNot for the faint of heart … Charlie Hunnam in Monster: Ed Gein.Photograph: Netflix“There’s something real dark about you Eddie Gein.” Quite the understatement. This latest addition toRyan Murphyand Ian Brennan’s Monster anthology serials dramatises the life of one of America’s most notorious killers. It posits Gein (played as a blankly dissociated shell of a man byCharlie Hunnam) as a near-prototype for Buffalo Bill of The Silence of the Lambs notoriety – Gein had a taste for making keepsakes from the remains of his victims and this fact is exploited for maximum creepiness.

Missouri’s Lake of the Ozarks area is extremely picturesque and something of a tourist trap – but the local economy depends on the police keeping it safe. There’s not much money laundering but plenty of low-key crime-fighting on display.

It’s a question that is being addressed increasingly frequently by TV dramas and comedies. This German series is not entirely resistant to the usual tropes of the emerging genre; it follows the travails of a group of 40-ish friends who find the encroaching modern world somewhat challenging. One of them is struggling with his new partner’s demanding libido. Another has been replaced at work by (gasp!) a young woman. And a third has retreated into a world of computer games.

The action takes place on the Irish border where polite, dutiful Northern Irish cop Philip Boyd (Eoin Macken) is paired with Aoife Regan (Amy De Bhrún), an abrasive counterpart from south of the border.

It stars Julia de Nunez, who embodies Brigitte very convincingly and begins when she poses (somewhat questionably, at the age of 15) for the cover of a brand new magazine called Elle.Channel 4, from Friday3 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best shows to stream this weekTV streamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s an unrelenting experience, as the camera circles tightly round the kids – lippy, defensive, smart, angry – and the committed but overworked staff. Murphy is superb as a good man at the end of his tether.Friday 3 October, NetflixThe Man in My BasementView image in fullscreenUnsettling … Willem Dafoe as Anniston Bennet and Corey Hawkins as Charles Blakey in The Man in My Basement.Photograph: AndscapeThe set-up of Nadia Latif’s edgy, unsettlingfilm, taken from a Walter Mosley novel, screams horror.

Then the mysterious Anniston (Willem Dafoe) offers to rent his basement for $1,000 a day for 65 days, no questions asked.

Sourced from Percival Everett’s acclaimed novel Erasure, it gleefully rips into the US publishing industry’s narrow-minded stance towards Black lives and readers.

Now, though, the podcast Wisecrack is asking the standup some difficult questions …Fri 26 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareOn Wednesday 22 July 2015, a 23-year-old man named Brett Rogers stabbed his mother and her friend 97 times, using seven different knives, over the course of an hour. Immediately afterwards, he made the short walk to the childhood home of comedian Edd Hedges, the boy he had bullied throughout school, and set about trying to break his door down.Hedges, who was staying with his parents after a local charity gig, was woken by his mother. She urged him to stay quiet and not turn on the lights. Eventually, after barricading themselves in their bathroom, the arrival of a police helicopter halted the attempted break-in. Rogers was arrested, charged and sentenced to a minimum of 32 years in prison.Two years later, this story – with several identifying details carefully obscured – formed the backbone of Hedges’sdebut soloEdinburgh fringe show Wonderland. One day, documentary producer Jodi Tovay found herself in the audience, after buying a ticket to escape the rain. She was transfixed by the storytelling, and snuck backstage to ask Hedges if she could investigate the story further. He was hesitant in a way that made her suspicious. Two years later, afterRogers had been killedin his cell by two fellow inmates, he called her and accepted her request. The outcome of this isWisecrack, a six-part podcast digging into the details around the events of that night. The project has been a runaway word of mouth hit – it is currently topping the UK iTunes charts – which makes it something of an anomaly for a true-crime show, because the crime’s victims and perpetrator are known from the start.“It’s not a whodunnit,” says Tovay from her home in the US over Zoom, on a joint call with Hedges. “We already know who did it. It’s an open-and-shut case. This is really an exploration of backstory. And it’s quite relatable, because everyone’s had a bully. We partnered with various bullying charities for the podcast, and they explained why the moment that Edd talks about is so powerful – because if you’re bullied, it’s the first expression of power that’s used against you. And if you’re the bully, it’s your first moment of feeling powerful.”View image in fullscreenOut of the spotlight … Comedian Edd Hedges.Photograph: Tenderfoot tvIn Wonderland – clips of which form the throughline of Wisecrack – Hedges details his fraught relationship with Rogers. Rogers was confident and good at sport; Hedges was overweight, dyslexic and asthmatic. During their time at school, Rogers would regularly pelt him with doughnuts. This, combined with life with a father cursed with a hot temper, made Hedges’s life particularly unhappy.“When I did the show in Edinburgh, the message was there are three examples of masculinity. There’s me, there’s Brett, and there’s my dad. They were the three characters. And all the while I was touring this, I was like: ‘This is a show about masculinity. This is about how I dealt with things, how Dad dealt with things, and how Brett was never allowed to deal with things.’ But as I’ve learned more through Jodi about Brett’s story, it has hit home in a way that I was not prepared for. The similarities between me and him were wild.”Hedges is palpably nervous as we talk. He’s softly spoken, and compulsively avoids eye contact. The release of the podcast, he says, has brought home how much he used Wonderland as a tool to stay on top of a terrifying moment in his life. “On stage, I have a say over what you think of me,” he says. “When I’m on stage, I get to control the narrative. And now the challenge that I’m having is that this is out there in the world, and people’s perception of me is being created without me being able to directly control it.”This is the neat trick Wisecrack plays. Other, more sensationalist podcasts would have glossed over Hedges completely and dived into the gory details of the murders. But Wisecrack is far more interested in the machinations of storytelling itself. The facts of the murders are incontrovertible. However, in crafting an hour-long show from it, Hedges is prone to a little artistic licence to maximise entertainment. After all, as one friend tells him in one episode, it’s called the Edinburgh comedy festival, not the Edinburgh story festival. As such, Wisecrack is Tovay’s effort to uncover what actually happened to Hedges and his family that night.“There was a point where Jodi had to ask: ‘Is this bullshit? Is all of this a lie? What are you making up?’” says Hedges. “She had to dig down into facts, and that was super-uncomfortable, because I didn’t really want to know the facts. I was protected by naivety. Talking to Jodi, I realised that I weaponised my naivety when I was doing this show live. Jodi sat me down and was like: ‘You need to answer everything. We need everything from you, every single thread.’”View image in fullscreenCrime seen … Wisecrack host and producer Jodi TovayPhotograph: Jon Buono Tenderfoot TVWhat follows is, in truth, more extraordinary than the murders themselves. Tovay begins to uncover the circumstances of Rogers’s life, his troubles and lack of support. Incredibly, she even talks to his dad. In 2012, three years before he killed his mother, Brett Rogers attacked his father Pete, stamping on his head and fracturing his eye socket. The interview with Pete is the standout moment of the entire series. You are listening to a man who endured tremendous anguish as his family was torn apart, and whose humanity in the wake of it is remarkable.“Pete is an incredible person,” says Tovay. “He is breaking the cycle of what might be typical for a man his age, and the typical way to respond to some really horrible things that happened to his family. I personally view him as a true hero in the story.”“If you knew the version of him that I grew up with, he has had a ‘come to Jesus’ moment,” adds Hedges. “He was a completely different man, and he’s gone through a proper healing journey. He has had to face a lot of demons.”Whether intentionally or not, Wisecrack is also a document of the relationship between Hedges and Tovay. She, a self-confessed “nosy American girl from a podcast” and he, a comedian torn between telling his story and wanting to protect himself. It has now been eight years since they met, and they have weathered a huge amount of ups and downs. Even during the recording of the podcast, despite Tovay going to Hedges’s village and interviewing the closest members of his family, there are moments when they don’t talk to each other.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I definitely trust Jodi more than anyone else I’ve ever worked with.”“Obviously, my expectations were very low when I first met him,” Tovay adds. “I didn’t even know if he’d respond to me at first. And to some degree, he didn’t respond many times. Now, I feel like an old friend or a big sister. It’s a very unique relationship. But personally, I think we’re quite close, and I feel very protective of you.”“If I didn’t trust her, this story would have been very hard to tell,” Hedges continues. “One of the reasons I didn’t respond to Jodi for so long is because I was like: ‘I will be damned if I’m about to put this in the hands of someone who’s going to cheapen it.’ The main thing I needed to see was respect, and respect for the fact that this is a village my family still live in.”Given that this is a story about violence fed through the lens of standup comedy, Wisecrack has drawn comparisons toBaby Reindeer. However, once it was released, the narrative around Baby Reindeer became more about the mistakes made in the duty of care towards the people depicted.“It’s not my favourite comparison,” sighs Tovay. “The responsibility towards the victims in this story, because there are two very clear victims, was our utmost concern.” However, by digging deep into the life of Brett Rogers, it also manages to take a figure who threatens to be a two-dimensional baddy and flesh him out. By the end, even if you don’t outright sympathise with him, you have a greater understanding of why he did what he did.“For a long time, I was like: ‘Oh, Brett’s the villain, 100%. He’s a bad guy,’” says Hedges. “But the one thing I hope people take away from this is that my story and Brett’s are dead parallel. My story could have so easily gone one way, and his could have gone the other. He’s a dude that went down a path and it didn’t go great, but so much of it is down to circumstance. That’s something I want people to realise.”Wisecrackis out now, widely available, episodes released weeklyExplore more on these topicsPodcastsBaby ReindeerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Remembering who she was inspired her phenomenal second LP, a comparison-defying odyssey of jazz, pop and club musicFri 26 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 03.32 EDTShareKeiyaA had been grinding in New York’s experimental jazz and hip-hop scenes for a good six years before her 2020 debut album,Forever, Ya Girl. Self-released on Bandcamp to make some cash while couchsurfing, the record totally shifted her life’s course. A low-key yet potent swirl of bedroom pop, R&B and electronic music that zeroed in on feelings of solitude and uncertainty, it struck a chord with critics at tastemaker sites such as Pitchfork and the Fader and became one of the year’s defining underground records.It also allowed her to tour the world; at the same time, the 33-year-old producer, singer and multi-instrumentalist born Chakeiya Richmond immediately began to feel the pressure of following it up, stress compounded by the end of a toxic relationship. “I was like, at worst, [the follow-up] has to be just as good. At best, it has to be better. How am I gonna do that? When you put that expectation on yourself, you’re not actually gonna meet that,” she says, sitting on the patio of a London cafe. Having struggled with depression her whole life, she experienced a renewed, debilitating spell. “There was the survival mode loop of like, couch rotting, bed rotting, having to work up [the energy] to take care of myself in general, let alone get to the computer to make music.”KeiyaA also noticed that she was changing herself to meet expectations. “There was a difference between the way I would dress myself than what I would accept when I was styled by someone,” she says. KeiyaA brings up the heavy tan shirt dress she wore to playNPR’s Tiny Desk Concert. “I’m grateful for the women who helped me find that dress, but I think I also felt like: I’m a fat woman and they’re trying to cover me up. I want to be snatched – I tend to wear clothes that are close to my body and black, and I like to show off my tattoos. When I watched [footage of] that Tiny Desk, I was like, ‘What am I wearing?’”In the blazing sun, KeiyaA is the picture of an ascendant off-duty star: her peach sunglasses, long curly black hair and tattooed arms make her hard to miss. She punctuates long, thoughtful ideas about life and art with peals of soft laughter. At the same time, she speaks with the openness of someone unwilling to put up armour in order to inure herself to the indignity and intensity of the music industry.Today she recognises that part of her was trying to capitulate to her community – her then-boyfriend was in the underground rap scene – and the teachers she had worked with when studying jazz at university. “I wanted neo-soul, hip-hop, rap greats to respect it – I wanted people likeMadlibto respect my production,” she says, between sips of her flat white. “Forever, Ya Girl was 100% me, but I also feel like there was a part of me that was trying to prove something to the elders. To show a certain type of respectability, or something. I’m still figuring that out.”KeiyaA’s second album Hooke’s Law is, at its core, about shaking off those expectations and finding a way to make music that’s free and totally intrinsic to her experience. Her first release for big-budget indielabel XL Recordings, it is an odyssey of jazz, pop, experimental composition and club music which she wrote and produced single-handedly. Hooke’s Law is a dense, rewarding listen: tempos melt and crystallise; the lyrics can be raw and ragged or totally raging, and they’re often jabbed by terse samples or abrupt beat switches. It is an expansive, tightly constructed album that many will hail as the album of the year.View image in fullscreenKeiyaA: ‘the gig starts when you step foot in the venue’.Photograph: Bre Johnson/BFA.com/ShutterstockFor a while, KeiyaA felt that she should be grateful for any attention she received. Born on the south side of Chicago, she was a musician from a young age. The jazz musicians she had grown up around taught her that “the gig starts when you step foot in the venue – when you communicate to your fans and to the crowd and staff you are in performance mode.”That mode of thinking could only go so far. After the release of Forever, Ya Girl, she had to contend with the idea that people suddenly thought of her as KeiyaA the indie star, rather than the human being Chakeiya. “Then I noticed it kept extending further and further past the gig. Now I’m outside getting some ice-cream – ‘Are you KeiyaA?’” she says. “Or like, at a party where I just want to shake ass with my friends, but now ‘KeiyaA’s at this party’ – especially if I’m with friends who are also famous, it’s like ‘KeiyaA andKelelaare at this party’, and people are staring, and suddenly you have a meet-and-greet line forming around you. I just want to shake my tail feather.”Interacting with her new fandom sometimes felt depersonalising, as if she had to meet expectations of who “KeiyaA” was; that pushing back would have negative repercussions for her career. “On my travels, people would constantly [say things] like ‘Oh, you’re actually really sweet and quiet and childlike.’ I’d be like, well, what did you expect? ‘We expected you to be very serious, kind of like a diva, very commanding’,” she recalls. “People expect me to be this sage, measured; everything I say is a profound one-liner. I’m like, it took me days to write those lyrics, guys!”A lot of the songs on Hooke’s Law deal with this newfound attention, as well as the difficulties of knowing whose interest in her was genuine. “I’m over here like, ‘I just wanted to be loved and accepted. Anybody want to love me? Hello, I’m worthy of love, guys!’ and people being like, ‘I want what you have’, or ‘I’m really inspired by you’, and me being like, OK, I’ll take that,” she says. Sometimes, what she thought was a mutual desire for connection turned out to be more one-sided. “If someone’s asking for something, I’m gonna help them – but then you notice over time, like, ‘Oh, you copied and pasted that sound, where’d you get that sound from? I read your interview and you were inspired by the film that I showed you.’ But it’s like, I hate even noticing it! These things sound so silly.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Experimenting with Auto-Tune allowed her to depersonalise the process. She likens it to “stepping into a mecha suit” – the kind of robot suit a superhero might use to fight a powerful enemy. By 2023, she was ready to force herself to snap out of her creative fugue. “I was like, what are you gonna do? Try to make something purposely for someone else’s approval? What would that even sound like?” she says. She turned her frustrations into an album whose lyrics say literal fuck-yous to landlords, insincere actors and violent colonial histories. “I definitely looked to the way punk expresses anger, the way metal expresses all the shit deeply, the way goth music expresses sadness and longing and desire, to inform the way I channelled those feelings.”‘Drumming is full of machismo, so vulgar, so dumb’: Valentina Magaletti, the musician giving the underground its rhythmRead moreThose influences had been in KeiyaA’s head for a long time; Hooke’s Law doesn’tsoundlike nu-metal, but it pays tribute to the nu-metal-head she was as a teen. “There was a part of me that really related to the white male hubris of nu-metal stuff as a teenager – a lot of those bands were from the midwest, trailer park, hood and speaking about their emotions in a very simple way,” she says. “At the time, I didn’t really know that they were reinterpreting Black sounds and inspired by hip-hop, which is why I was like, OK, intellectually, I’m not gonna have as strong of a relationship with this music – it felt like a betrayal to me as a Black queer woman. But I listened to it again recently and I’m like, this shit still hits.” She has been thinking about trying to write in conventional pop structures, inspired by the melodic US indie-rock band Pinback. “Historically, I’m a goth – I either love the girls or, like, really hard, punk metal music.”That is KeiyaA’s MO right now: trying hard to accept that the ideas she once held about all aspects of her life may be more mutable than they once seemed. When she was in the depths of her depression after the release of Forever, Ya Girl, she spiralled, thinking that maybe life wasn’t worth living if she couldn’t find clear answers for everything. And then, one day, she asked herself: “Really? Are you sure?” she recalls. “I was like, did you die? No. It hurts really bad. It’s really hard, it’s weird, it may be something you hold for ever. But did you die? No!”Hooke’s Law is released via XL Recordings on 31 OctoberExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockR&BHip-hopJazzfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Born in the midwest and based in New York since the 90s, Grimstad is a literature professor at Yale, has written essays on Jimi Hendrix and Alan Turing for the New Yorker, and has composed music for a number of films, including last year’s The Sweet East, to which he contributed Evening Mirror, a charming hypno-folk track featuring lead actor Talia Ryder. He’s also an actor, and has small parts in Paul Thomas Anderson’s new Thomas Pynchon adaptation One Battle After Another, as well as Marty Supreme, Josh Safdie’s ping pong biopic starring Timothée Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow.And then there’s Songs, his debut album, released this month alongside Music for Film, a compilation of his scores. A maniacal odyssey of prog, jazz, boogie rock, psych and pop, Songs pays homage to the hi-fi chaos of 70s art-rock classics such as Todd Rundgren’s A Wizard, a True Star, rarely staying in one lane for more than a couple of minutes across its breakneck 16-track, 40-minute runtime. Performed, produced and engineered entirely by Grimstad, Songs is catchy, hilarious and terrifying in equal measure: passages of sleek funk-pop rub up against snatches of psychotic haunted-house laughter and songs indebted to Philly soul at its sleaziest. Grimstad is an astoundingly talented producer, and it’s a credit to his skill that, despite all the bird coos and whiplash-inducing changes of pace, Songs is a delight to listen to – lush and ludicrous in all the right ways.Shaad D’SouzaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenJuana Molina.Photograph: Verena AlgrantiJuana Molina – Siestas AhíThe Argentinian experimental legend returns after eight years away with this gorgeous devotional about dissolving in someone’s kisses, her strange, ticking guitar suddenly gleefully unfurling like a party blower.LSUFOs – UFOFrench touch royalty Braxe + Falcon and Phoenix unite for this woozy, melancholy throb, with Thomas Mars singing about the irrational nature of belief as he pleads to be let back into someone’s heart.LSPaul St Hilaire andShinichi Atobe – Time to Wake UpSt Hilaire is the defining vocalist of dub techno, and his new album pairs him with an awesome array of producers from Mala to Batu; Japanese deep house genius Atobe gives him an insistent, aqueous riddim.BBTLael Neale – Some Bright MorningOmnichord and vintage drum machines power the momentum of Neale’s ode to the dream of a day when work is finally over.

Reissuing out-of-print rarities along with new interpretations from contemporary artists, their albums have included 2017’s exploration of Kenyan Benga music, a 2021 recording of the oral traditions of Gulf pearl divers and most recently a catalogue of Greek orthodox singing from the monastery on Mount Athos. Their latest edition is equally specific, delving into both archival and new French-language Creole music from Louisiana.View image in fullscreenPasé Bél Tan: Francophonies & Creolities In LouisianaInfluenced by the birth of jazz in New Orleans, as well as early blues, rock’n’roll and French colonial legacy, this largely African American folk music of the 1950s to the 1980s veers from poignant lyricism to rollicking, full-throated celebration. The dancefloor-focused side of the archival material features several infectious songs from bandleaderClifton Chenier. Known as the founder of Creole folk genre zydeco, Chenier’s arrangements incorporate bluesy guitar riffs alongside scraping washboard rhythms and the metallic twang of piano accordion. The resulting sound, on Laissez les Bon Temps Rouler and Jolie Blonde, is deep-swinging and joyous, anchored in Chenier’s own whooping vocalisations.That foot-stomping feel reverberates through Isome J Fontenot’s lively harmonica playing on La Banane à Nonc Adam. The contemporary recordings are equally upbeat, meandering from rap verses to techno bass and industrial distortion, but prove too wide-ranging to cohere.‘He made the dust fly!’ Mick Jagger and others on 100 years of Clifton Chenier, the king of zydecoRead moreInstead, it’s in the more minimal, vocal-led arrangements that the album truly shines. Singer Alma Barthélémy’s recording of Ma Bonne Créole aches in its tender vibrato, while Caesar Vincent’s nasal tone lends a searching feel to the a cappella ballad Travailler C’est Trop Dur. These quiet moments offer an affecting window into history; even through lo-fi recordings, you can hear the singers’ breathy, yearning tones, calling out into the Louisiana wetlands for someone to listen.Also out this monthBeirut-based sextetSanamrelease their excellent second album,Sametou Sawtan (Constellation).

Ethiopian singerMeklit’s husky vocal power drives her jazz-influenced latest albumA Piece of Infinity (Smithsonian Folkways), featuring elaborate interpretations of Ethiopian folk songs embellished by roaring horn fanfares and intricate percussion. Senegalese singerCheikh Lôreturns with his first album in a decade,Maame (World Circuit). Typically uplifting, Lô’s arrangements are full of lilting finger-picked guitar melodies and his own softly wavering voice that displays a new warmth at 70.Explore more on these topicsMusicGlobal album of the monthJazzBluesPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a quote that Islam reproduces in his autobiography, viewing it as a benediction, but it also tells you something about the music that made him globally famous.In the early 70s, the charts were awash with sensitive folky singer-songwriters. Their constituency, as Islam perceptively notes, was “the college generation, away from home, lonely and trying to find their place in the university of high academic expectations”. But none were as obsessed with spirituality as Cat Stevens, with his album titles that namechecked Buddha or referenced Zen poems, his conceptual song cycles based on numerology, his lyrical exhortations to “kick out the devil” and “get to heaven, get a guide”, and Morning Has Broken, the hymn he made a 1972 US No 1. If you’d had to place bets on which 70s superstar would pack it all in for religion, you’d have got far lower odds on Cat Stevens than, say, Noddy Holder.Indeed, reading his autobiography, his retreat from pop stardom seems less surprising than the fact he stuck it out for as long as he did. Living above his parents’ Shaftesbury Avenue cafe, he enjoyed a “street-loose” childhood: the early chapters depict a London baffling to the modern reader, in that ordinary people could actually afford to live in W1. Equally surprising is Islam’s love of his primary school. When a 1950s nun-run Catholic school appears in an autobiography, it’s almost invariably a source of unending misery, but no; he’s enraptured by the mysticism of mass, and haunted by the suggestion that angels start taking note of your misdeeds when you turn eight.There are plenty of misdeeds to note: by his early teens, he’s attempting to balance school with life as a pill-popping mod. Galvanised by Dylan, he becomes a folkie and starts writing songs. He spends less than a year trying to attract interest, before scoring both a record deal and an immediate hit with his 1966 debut single, I Love My Dog. Its follow-up, Matthew and Son, reaches No 2 in the UK. It’s a meteoric rise – he’s still only 19 – and Islam seems to have hated every minute. Live shows are “degrading” and “intolerable”, having his photo taken is “as close to hell as I ever want to get”, interviews are akin to being “placed in the stocks”, appearing on television is more like “the gallows”, and his mohair suit is too itchy (“a horror”). Within months, he’s calculating how much money he’ll need to make in order to retire.Buddhism, the Bible, meditation, the I- Ching: you couldn’t accuse him of not shopping around before settling on IslamA brush with tuberculosis and a stay in hospital prompts a rethink: out with the heavily orchestrated pop singles, in with guitars and soul-searching lyrics. In remarkably short order, he’s more successful than ever: 1970’s Tea for the Tillerman and 1971’s Teaser and the Firecat each sell nearly 4m copies worldwide. Their sleeves featured children’s book illustrations suggesting a certain faux naivety – so, for that matter, does each chapter in his autobiography – but the lyrical soul-searching isn’t a posture. As the 70s progress, he tries Buddhism, the Bible, meditation, the I Ching: you couldn’t accuse him of not shopping around before settling on Islam, spurred by a near-death experience in the ocean off Malibu.Booze and drugs are abandoned, his girlfriends (tellingly plural: for a man who didn’t care for stardom, Islam certainly enjoyed its spoils) are ditched in favour of a traditional Muslim marriage. Giving up music seems to have been less of a wrench than you might expect. His songwriting had “reached a cul-de-sac”: with his royalties to live off, he genuinely seems happier doing charity work.Given his aversion to interviews, he’s an unlikely choice as a spokesperson, but he can’t escape his old celebrity. The media are either baffled or hostile, particularly after 9/11, when his high profile lands him on a no-fly list (“a real success story in the war on terror,” quips US chatshow host Jon Stewart, “we finally got the guy that wrote Peace Train”). Occasionally, he doesn’t help himself: it probably wasn’t the smartest idea to make what he insists were jokes about the Salman Rushdie fatwa on national TV (he also alleges canny editing on the programme-makers’ part).Still, he claims that the ensuing furore led him to investigate Islamic jurisprudence further, which in turn led him back to music: cue comeback albums, tours, Glastonbury, even a return to the name Cat Stevens. He seems happy, ending his story with a poem that opens “when I was a little foetus”. Whatever you make of that, it reads remarkably like one of the more wide-eyed lyrics from his heyday. Yusuf Islam has been on quite a journey, but some things never change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Whether it’s music, paintings or movies, the artist does their bit – but it’s the involvement of our own psyche that completes the circle. This is even more true for games, because we don’t sit for 100 hours in front of the Mona Lisa.Relationships with art change over time. I appreciated animation more when I was a younger man. I appreciate jazz much more today. I find the Mona Lisa alluring or boring depending on what mood I am in.This made playingClair Obscur: Expedition 33a fascinating prospect, because it is a game about art and our attempts to capture what we love in painting. At least I think that’s what it’s about. It’s complicated, as is my evolving relationship with the game. When I started playing it, I was bedazzled by its beauty – just like I was when I spotted my wife walking across an office nearly 30 years ago, lit by what seemed to be her own personal shaft of sunlight, like Glenn Close in The Natural. (RIP Robert Redford.)The characters are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, visually and aurally, with some of the best voice acting I have ever heard and a score that takes your breath away. I didn’t really understand the plot much at first; there’s something vaguely Logan’s Run about it, with people getting scrubbed from existence by someone (something?) called the Paintress when they reach a certain age. Each year a hardy band sets off on an expedition to find and defeat her, saving the next tranche of humanity from disappearing into dust and rose petals.View image in fullscreenClair Obscur’s brave adventurers attempt to escape the annualgommageevent that is slowly wiping them out.Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveBut I wasn’t too bothered by the plot because I was in love with how it looked and sounded, and sometimes it takes a while to understand your object of desire. There were other aspects I fell headlong in love with: a turn-based RPG lives or dies by the combat system and this has a dazzling (if initially confusing) array of moves, skills, counters and parries. But as I progressed and got to know it, the relationship deepened, and the combat system became glorious. It was so satisfying it made me forgive the mercifully rare but utterly shambolic attempts at platforming sections, which were so bad I wondered whether they were supposed to be a pastiche of the original Tomb Raider.Anyway, we ignore faults in those we love, don’t we?I spent way too much time with Expedition 33. I am a pretty pants player, and I like to grind a fair bit to make boss battles easier. The internet tells me that the game takes 30 hours to play. It took me more than 50 to get to the last boss, because I did something I rarely do with games these days: I played it at the default difficulty instead of easy story mode. The gameplay was so rewarding that I didn’t mind losing battles multiple times: learning the idiosyncratic timing of each battle became a reward in itself, like learning how to volley a football.As the days passed, though, I started to get irritated. There are no level maps, so you don’t know whether a path is a quick detour or a long, pointless waste of time. I got grumpy that the plot showed no signs of getting any less abstruse, with dialogue that was veering towards the pretentious (“Painting isn’t about verisimilitude, it’s about essence” – come on, man!). But I was committed to this game, for better for worse, in sickness and in health.Then something happened that ruined everything.After finally defeating the Paintress in a boss fight that took 30 minutes, the game … crashed.View image in fullscreenThe combat is so exciting that I didn’t mind failing – until …Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveCrashed. Booted me out to the title screen. I can’t remember the last time that happened to me with an Xbox game. I went online and found out this is a bug that many people have experienced. As far as I am aware, there isn’t even an update patch on Xbox Series S, and this game has been out since April. In relationship terms, my coitus was unforgivably interruptused. You simply cannot release a game with a bug that shatters you at the last moment like this.I found out you could work around this bug by pausing as soon as you get to the cutscene, but that means missing the cutscene.

After a plot twist that could only get more ludicrous if I understood it, there is a whole new third act.When I tried to carry on, I just felt resentment. Resentment at the time I had spent in my relationship with this game. Time I could have spent inotherrelationships.What had started as something new and beautiful had been tainted. Things I thought were cool (such as the friendship-building between characters that unlocks bigger and better moves) now seemed pedantic and clunky. The trust was gone. Could I really be arsed with another long, difficult boss battle if it was going to crash at the end?I’m not saying I am getting a divorce from Expedition 33. But I do think we need some time apart before I commit again.Explore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamescommentShareReuse this content"

However, Lacrima gathers its pace meditatively before it begins to hurtle and then becomes devastating viewing from which you can’t look away.The marriage of an unnamed British princess has been announced and the making of her wedding dress, by a British designer, is under way. He enlists a Parisian atelier that outsources its most labour-intensive work to an Indian tailor. The dress is a wildly elaborate concoction of embroidered silk, handmade lace and a 200-metre train of 150,000 pearls.Using four languages, with English surtitles, the production initially seems like a documentation of processes and the invisible labour involved in such an illustrious commission. We variously follow Marion (Maud Le Grevellec), head seamstress at the Paris workshop, a group of lace-makers in France, and the ageing tailor, Abdul (Charles Vinoth Irudhayaraj), who works quietly, relentlessly, with needle and thread. There are video calls with the princess and interviews with French lace-makers who speak of inheriting their dying craft. A French official delivers pedantic rules to an Indian manager and it becomes clear the international codes of conduct offer no protection to Indian workers, serving only the French atelier.View image in fullscreenA world of suffering … the set of Lacrima.Photograph: Jean-Louis FernandezWritten and directed by Caroline Guiela Nguyen, the human drama emerges to take gradual hold until it is a chokingly emotive story of overwork and enslavement. The creation of the dress contains a world of suffering, devotion and conflict. Scenes of Marion’s abusive marriage to Julien (Dan Artus), an insecure pattern-maker at the workshop, are masterfully enacted and horrifying in their realism. The sight of Abdul, who sits sewing pearls on to the dress’s train, slowly going blind through the intensity of the work, is deeply moving.It is almost too painful to watch as characters feel the crushing pressure of their jobs, all emotional and family life squeezed to the sidelines. Yet many regard the work as a vocation, dedicating themselves to the creation of beauty. It does not erase the circuit of exploitation, but makes this story all the more emotionally complicated. The making of a single dress gains shades of Greek tragedy.Alice Duchange’s set design transforms by turns into the Parisian atelier, the world of the lace-makers and the workshop in Mumbai. There are video split screens above the stage that draw your eye to a face or a pair of hands engaged in lace-making or embroidery.It is clear that the show has been comprehensively researched and that information is deftly sewn into the drama. It has some extraneous strands – a subplot involving an elderly lace-maker and a hereditary illness is perhaps overcomplicated, while the sweary British designer sounds slightly off-key. But this is a monumental, magnetic production.AtBarbican theatre, London, until 27 September, then touring internationally.Explore more on these topicsTheatreBarbicanFashion industryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Both shows have a striking elevator pitch and consider how we make the most of the time available to us. Benjamin finds – and holds on to – love as he ages backwards whereas in 50 First Dates, based on the Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler romcom, Lucy and Henry endlessly replay their first encounter. She has short-term memory loss from an accident so wakes each morning with no recollection of the previous day; he ventures to sustain their relationship regardless.But while the Curious Case musical dug deep into the mysteries of time, 50 First Dates is more confined by its concept and never packs enough emotional punch. That’s partly because the book by David Rossmer and Steve Rosen can be bland and their songs breezily enjoyable, without a heart-wrenching number that does justice to the pain at the story’s centre. Nevertheless, there are two genial leads with fine voices: Georgina Castle lights up the stage as always and Josh St Clair convincingly handles Henry’s switch from obnoxious playboy to caring partner.The story is relocated from Hawaii to Key Largo, Florida. Henry is not a marine veterinarian (so no more vomiting walruses) but a travel blogger, which means he is always on the next flight after a one-night stand whereas in the film it was the tourists he seduced who moved on. His blog is devoted to creating the “perfect day” in different destinations, a rather too on-the-nose parallel to the developing plot. There’s still a homespun diner (“everything has gluten!”), run by Aiesha Naomi Pease and Ricky Rojas, with Chad Saint Louis as their Disney-obsessed waiter and a gang of locals who cheer Henry on.View image in fullscreenOde to Key Largo … the cast of 50 First Dates: The Musical.Photograph: Pamela RaithFly Davis has designed a flexible beach chic set, under the golden glow of Aideen Malone’s lighting, with restaurant booths making way for the home where Lucy’s salty father (John Marquez) and bellicose brother (Charlie Toland) devotedly conceal her condition. The film’s air of creepiness, and dismal stereotyping, are swept out.Lucy and Henry’s backstories are also clearer, his parents’ unhappy marriage explaining his fear of commitment and her mother’s death adding clearer fragility to her family. But it’s not just the diner’s waffles that come with syrup as the lyrics can be cloying. Much more effective are the comic songs in Casey Nicholaw’s production, like the ode to Key Largo performed by high-kicking dancers with fishing rods instead of canes. They are a sunny ensemble for a musical that, despite its sandy setting, remains firmly in the middle of the road.Atthe Other Palace, London, until 16 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMusicalsDrew BarrymoreAdam SandlerComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

But weary of his own persona, Johnson turned to indie director Benny Safdie – and delivered a bruising new role that rewrites his own rulebookFri 26 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 06.27 EDTShareFor much of his career, Dwayne Johnson has been stuck between the Rock and a hard place. In the early years of his transition from body-slamming World Wrestling Entertainment heavy to marquee movie star, he was still being billed under hisnom de ring. Even once he retired that moniker, he seemed to be lugging behind him a persona from which he might never be free. There are people-pleasers and then there is this affable brawler-turned-actor, who appears to regard the contentment of the world’s multiplex-goers as his personal responsibility. Whether in vehicles comic (Central Intelligence, Baywatch), family-oriented (Jumanji, Jungle Cruise), four-wheeled (theFast & Furiousseries) or disaster-based (San Andreas, Skyscraper), he is a rip-roaring razzle-dazzler, shiny of scalp and tooth, and so colossal that he isn’t merely the circus showman but the whole damn big top too.Not that he hasn’t been lavishly remunerated for all that heavy lifting. He can out-grinandout-gross Tom Cruise: Johnson has 392 million Instagram followers to Cruise’s 15 million, and was Forbes magazine’s highest-paid actor for five of the last nine years. That includes 2024, when he pocketed $88m. (Cruise didn’t make the top 20 that year.)But Johnson is the first to admit there has been trouble in paradise for some time. “I’ve been in this space for years where I wanted to do more,” the 53-year-old actor tells me over video call from Los Angeles.Things came to a pretty pass last year when his much-despised Christmas comedy-adventureRed One, for which he reportedly earned around $50m for playing Santa’s head of security, not only flopped spectacularly (it grossed $186m worldwide on a $250m budget) but was accompanied by stories of Johnson’s poor on-set behaviour: rumours of persistent tardiness (which he has denied), or his habit of peeing in bottles and leaving assistants to dispose of them (which he accepted). It’s one reason to feel disconcerted when he arrives 25 minutes late to our interview. On the plus side, the liquid in his water bottle isn’t yellow.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted to challenge myself’ … Dwayne Johnson in The Smashing Machine.Photograph: Ent-movie/AlamyHe clearly wasn’t happy. “I wanted to not only challenge myself but to listen to my gut,” he says. “To really rip myself open. And, quite honestly, I was scared. I’m not a big therapy guy. I’ve had some great conversations with therapists but it’s not the thing I run to. I bottle shit up inside me, like a lot of guys, which I recognise is not the healthiest thing to do.” He shrugs. His tight white shirt, unbuttoned to the chest, seems to stretch and creak. “Then I said: Wait, I can still do the thing I love, which is acting. But what if there’s something deeper and more meaningful in it for me?”“Yeah!”Piping up beside him, in a voice as chipper as Johnson’s is ruminative and rumbling, is the actor’s own personal hype-man: Benny Safdie, the feted 39-year-old film-maker who has helped facilitate Johnson’s swerve away from disposable entertainment to high-calibre cinema. Safdie made his name alongside his brother Josh co-directing full-blown cinematic panic-attacks such asGood TimeandUncut Gems. Now he has gone solo for The Smashing Machine, in which Johnson plays Mark Kerr, the real-life mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter who amassed a fortune pummelling opponents – and, as his might began to wane,gettingpummelled – in eye-gouging, head-kicking Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts.View image in fullscreenChaotic … Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in The Smashing Machine.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockJohnson has known Kerr since the late 1990s, when they would bump into one another on the circuit. “There was a lot of connective tissue betweenMMAin the late 1990s and what I was doing. Same arenas, same gyms. Same demons, too.” Around 2008, he became obsessed with the documentary The Smashing Machine: The Life and Times of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr, which showed Kerr at his euphoric highs and pitiful lows. The actor sensed that a dramatised film of that story would not only be compelling but could provide a solution to his brewing dissatisfaction at having acted himself into a corner. Playing Kerr, he might just be able to cage-fight his way out of his own gilded cage.And so it has proved. For The Smashing Machine, Johnson spent several hours each day having the prosthetics applied which would turn him into Kerr, but that isn’t the only reason he is unrecognisable in the film. With Safdie’s encouragement, he also located within himself an actor no one knew existed. He had previously departed from form only twice: he was used for novelty value in Southland Tales, Richard Kelly’s maligned follow-up to Donnie Darko, and was entertaining as a dumb-lug bodybuilder turned kidnapper in Michael Bay’s Pain & Gain. The Smashing Machine, though, feels fully driven by his hunger as an actor.Near the start of the film, Kerr finds it impossible to imagine what it might feel like to lose. The remainder of the movie shows what happens when this born champion is confronted by his own fallibility. Banjaxed by injuries and an addiction to painkillers, his chaotic relationship with his girlfriend Dawn (played by Johnson’s Jungle Cruise co-star Emily Blunt) starts to unravel. In the process, The Smashing Machine becomes an unusual proposition: a film about a winner who must learn how to lose, and a loving couple who probably shouldn’t be together.View image in fullscreen‘I love making the big films. But there’s something freeing about this process’ … Johnson with Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungl‪e.Photograph: Frank Masi/Sony PicturesSafdie doesn’t quibble with that description, but nor does he exactly embrace it. “I still want the audience to feel good at the end,” he says. That they do is largely down to Johnson’s charisma, which is less ingratiating now that it is complicated by his character’s pain and self-doubt. One scene in particular is a revelation. As Dawn goads and taunts him during an argument at home, Kerr – who, despite being the size of a bookcase, is as gentle and softly spoken as a librarian – lets rip, tearing the kitchen door apart as if he were ripping a tissue in two. The truly impressive moment, though, occurs seconds earlier, when his eyes drain of life and he becomes chillingly still.“I’ve never played a scene like that before,” says Johnson, hushed by the memory of it. How did it feel? “Like not acting but living in the moment. You go elsewhere. You don’t know where you’re going and you don’t know how you come back.” Safdie remembers it well: “Afterwards, we were all very emotional,” he says. “Crying and going: ‘Oh my God.’ Because you can’t express those sorts of feelings unless you’ve felt them before.”This is the first of several times that Safdie hints at the personal struggles and frustrations that his lead actor brought to the picture. “When we met,” he tells Johnson, “I saw behind your eyes this desire to really explore something about yourself.”I ask whether there were indeed autobiographical elements to playing Kerr. “In what way?” Johnson asks, stiffening slightly. Safdie leaps in to answer for him. “Well, yeah, right, because there’s that thing of having to put on a certain face for the crowd, which I knew Dwayne felt too.” He turns to Johnson again. “I knew you were telling and discovering a part of yourself also.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve never played a scene like that before’ … (from left) director Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson on set of The Smashing Machine.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockThe actor takes up the idea. “It’s the challenge of having to live up to an image. I can empathise with Mark in that. There’s this image of you and, as it forms, people keep piling shit on: ‘You can do it. Now do it like this. And here’s more, and more. Now come over here and do this thing, and that thing.’” I start to see the sisyphean side to this Rock.Like Kerr, Johnson has come to accept his own vulnerability. In a time of political tyrants and would-be strongmen, when the US president’s go-to insults are “loser” and “failing”, that puts The Smashing Machine out of step with the prevailing culture. And not only the political one. Safdie and Johnson both work in an industry that does not brook failure: flop on your opening weekend, fall short of your expected box office gross, and you can become a pariah. Colleagues will cold shoulder you at Los Angeles lunch spots. People will lose your number.Competition is endemic in Hollywood. Like it or not, Safdie himself is squaring up for a battle with his own brother: Josh Safdie has also directed a new sport drama – Marty Supreme, starring Timothée Chalamet as a fictional 1950s table-tennis champion loosely based on Marty Mauser – which is out soon through the same distributor (A24). Thetrade paper Variety predicts that Marty Supreme will dominatemost of next year’s Oscar categories, including best picture and best director, while it places The Smashing Machine’s chances mainly in the acting slots.“Look, Josh is my brother, you know?” he laughs, wriggling in his seat. “I love my brother. I think it’s cool that we both have movies out. I was joking with a friend of mine about how there are always these boxing brothers like the Klitschko and Charlo brothers. And he admitted to me: ‘I know this is wrong, but when they fight, I always wanna see them beat each other up’. And I can kinda see a little bit of that happening!” Should things turn ugly on the red carpet, at least Benny Safdie can count on Johnson to back him up, whereas all his brother has is little Timmy Chalamet.For once, the pressure is off Johnson himself. “You know, I’ll share this with you,” he says, making me lean closer to the screen. “This is the first time in my career that I’ve not thought about box office once. And I like that. I appreciate it. With the other films, the big ones, the four-quadrant movies, it’s pressurised. Sure, I love making the Jumanjis and Moanas. But there’s something so freeing about this process. We want this movie to open well and hope a lot of people like it. But for that not to bethe thing… What a difference.”View image in fullscreenJohnson in The Smashing Machine.Photograph: Ent-movie/AlamyOrdinarily, he would be quaking on the eve of a new picture coming out. “It’s a scary time because so much effort and money goes into the opening weekend here in the States. Then it’s: ‘How will it hold up? What will it do internationally? Maybe we should change that scene because it’d play better in Asia …’ I make all these big movies, and some have been really good and some not so good at all. But this was one for me.” Gesturing to Safdie, he amends his remark: “Forus.”Having tasted freedom, how can he ever go back to his old way of working? “Well, that’s a smart question. I feel like I need to have a conversation about that with my therapist Benny here.” They laugh together. But the point stands. With The Smashing Machine, it may be Johnson’s persona which has finally been smashed for good.The Smashing Machine is in Australian cinemas from 2 October and US and UK cinemas from 3 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmDwayne JohnsonA24Emily BluntDrama filmsBiopicsMMAinterviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s a lot going on these days on the lush forest moon of bioluminescent ferns and giant blue space cats. We’ve had the forest tribes, the sea tribes, even the bit where Sigourney Weaver gets reincarnated as her own teenage daughter. And now in Avatar: Fire and Ash,the first full-length trailer for which launched this week, we get a full-blown theological crisis, and a planet that might be running out of breathable air.Oona Chaplin’s Varang is the leader of the Ash clan, who look like Cirque du Soleil performers who’ve been left too close to the barbecue. She’s extremely angry and cynical because her entire extended family got flambéed by a volcanic eruption. But even more so because Eywa, the godlike neural network that can unleash planetary catastrophe at will, did absolutely nothing to help.This sets up an intriguing wrinkle for the new movie. If the god that rules your planet isn’t mystical, ineffable and comfortingly invisible, does that make it any easier when she abandons you? And is Eywa even capable of stopping volcanoes in the first place? Can she really shut down a minor geological tantrum? Maybe not. Also, isn’t deciding you’re an atheist when there’s palpable proof that your god exists a bit like declaring you don’t believe in digital media while streaming Love Island on your phone? Who needs faith when you’ve got swishy USB-compatible tails that can plug straight into the creator? Why indulge in blind devotion when it’s far easier to just complain down the divine helpline that the floating mountains still haven’t been fitted with railings, or the banshees keep crashing into the washing line?Either way, Varang is clearly severely annoyed, and out to take revenge on anyone who thinks Eywa rules, which apparently means teaming up with evil Colonel Quaritch and his human overlords. This brings us to the other major plot point being hinted at: are the mean old homo sapiens terraforming Pandora to kill off the Na’vi?!There’s a key point in the trailer where we see Spider, the Sullys’ human pal, remove his mask and breathe without difficulty, which is quite an impressive feat when we’re told the atmosphere on this forest moon is a dense blend of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, xenon and methane. Jake Sully then appears to suggest that this development means the Na’vi might one day become incapable of breathing on their own planet. But then another scene sees Spider apparently plugging into a Pandoran sea creature, as if he were a native, which suggests the earthlings might be genetically altering themselves to suit their new environment (Spider is, after all, Quaritch’s son) rather than the other way around.If that’s the case, it’s hard to know what is scarier: the idea of humans rewiring their own biology to pass as Na’vi, or the possibility that they’re quietly terraforming Pandora so the locals eventually suffocate. Either way, it’s colonialism with the dial snapped clean off. Not content with stealing the land and resources, the humans are now determined to tilt the entire biosphere in their favour.Frankly, there is an awful lot to dig through here. If the mere trailer is this dense, watching the actual movie (which is rumoured to be even longer than Avatar: The Way of Water’s three hours and 12 minutes) is going to be like shinnying up Mount Everest, only to find James Cameron waiting at the summit with a three-hour slideshow of bioluminescent plankton and extraterrestrial religious schisms.

Now, she’s confident in her strength and abilityMadeleine AggelerFri 26 Sep 2025 16.17 EDTFirst published on Fri 26 Sep 2025 12.11 EDTShareIn October, Kate Evert will begin the long journey from the small town of Republic, Missouri, to Cape Town, South Africa, to compete in the World Masters Powerlifting Championships. The competition is for athletes aged 40 and above – Evert is 75.“Seventy-six in November, heaven help me,” she says.Evertstarted liftingin 2018, because of her children’s nagging about her health. Since then, she has won four powerlifting national championships in her age and weight bracket.If you think a 75-year-old woman powerlifting is uncommon, well, you’re right. “The thing about competition at my age is that there aren’t very many competitors. Like, hardly any,” Evert says. “For three of those national championships I was the only lifter in my age and weight class, so I got the medal just by showing up.”But this isn’t false humility. Evert is confident about her strength and ability. And she’s been researching her competition in Cape Town – one other woman – and she likes her odds. “Not dissing that woman at all,” Evert says. “I’m just stronger.”I talked to Evert over the phone to hear about how she got into lifting and her championship preparation.How did you get into weightlifting?It was six years ago – I was 69. I live alone, and my children started to tell me that they didn’t want me to be the little old lady who falls and can’t get up, so would I please go to a gym? I hated sweating and I didn’t like the gym. It was boring and stupid. But I said, fine, if it’ll get you off my back, I’ll do it.Falling can be risky. Here’s how to avoid it and what to do if it happensRead moreSo I went to a gym, and the [gym staff] interviewed me and said: “Why are you here? What are your goals?” And I said: “I want to get strong.” Why that came out of my mouth, I have no idea.They assigned me to this trainer, who I later found out focused on power lifters. We started working out, and I hated it, and it was fine.Then one day, about six months after I started, my trainer took out his phone and pulled out a video of an old woman doing a deadlift. He told me she was a client of his, and that she was lifting 204lbs at the Missouri state championships.Later, my trainer said: “I knew I had you when you looked at me all starry-eyed and said: ‘Can I do that?’”a woman powerlifting‘The thing about competition at my age is that there aren’t very many competitors. Like, hardly any,’ Evert says. Video: kwevert/InstagramSoon after, he left that gym [to work at] a power-lifting gym. I followed him there, and we started squatting, benching and deadlifting. We worked on making my body understand how to do this stuff. It took me a year before I could confidently squat without falling over backwards.Why do you think that video made you go starry-eyed?She was an old woman like me, and she was doing a thing that made me go: “Wow, you’re a badass.” That appealed to me – being able to do something that most people my age couldn’t do.I also wanted to be able to thumb my nose at my kids and say: “See what I can do now? I’m not a lightweight who falls and can’t get up.”Once you started seriously lifting, how did you feel? What did you like about it?A lot of it was the reaction I would get from people when I told them what I was doing. Young people would go: “That’s so awesome!” That felt good.And I loved the fact that I could do these things. The fact that I could put 200lbs on my back, squat down and then stand up again felt awesome.The other thing is, your endorphins get going, and they’re doing happy parties up and down your spine, and you feel really good. I often say, if I could bottle how good I feel at the end of a workout and sell it, I would make a fortune.What’s your favorite lift?It used to be thedeadlift, because it’s the easiest one to learn. Once you learn how to hinge [your hips], you can deadlift.Now my favorite is the squat. I have a squatter’s body, with short little legs and arms. The squat is my favorite because you have to really think about it. There are a lot of things going on that you have to make sure you’re doing properly. You can’t think about anything else. My mantra when I squat is: “Control, sink, explode.” Having that in my head and nothing else is restful, in a weird way. We live such scattered lives now, that being able to not think about anything else is nice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was the first lifter, and I was as terrified as I’ve ever been in my life, mostly because I didn’t want to embarrass myself. Then I proceeded to do just that.My squat was about 120lbs. Not very much. But because I was so nervous, I did what’s called a “dive bomb”: you’re not in control when you squat down, so you lose all your bracing and can’t get back up. I fell onto my backside. Luckily, the spotters caught the bar and it was fine. I was like, why am I doing this?Power lifters are some of the nicest people you’ll ever meet. Yes, we compete, but it’s you against the ironThen I did well for the rest of the competition, and since then I’ve generally done two national-level meets every year.Part of what I love is having an audience. But I also had to admit that I’m competitive. Competition is what makes me keep lifting. Because otherwise, it’s hard work, and it can be scary. If I didn’t have any reason other than to be healthy, I don’t know if I would do it.I’ll also tell you, power lifters are some of the nicest people you’ll ever meet. Yes, we compete with each other, but at the end of the day, it’s you against the iron. Either you can lift it or you can’t. That provides us the opportunity to cheer each other on.a woman powerlifting‘Competition is what makes me keep lifting. Because otherwise, it’s hard work, and it can be scary.’ Video: prs_performance/InstagramHave you inspired any of your friends or family to start lifting?No. There are several of my friends who would benefit from this, but you can lead a horse to water … They watch me and go: “That’s really cool, you’re so strong.” But they don’t make the mental leap of: “I need to do that.”You’re heading to Cape Town in October for the World Masters Powerlifting Championships. How are you preparing?I work out three times a week. Tuesday is when we do top sets [heaviest set of repetitions performed for an exercise] for squat and bench. Wednesdays is an auxiliary arms day to build up my upper-body strength. And then Friday is Kill Kate Day. That’s when we do volume [a high number of sets and repetitions with slightly lower weights] for all three lifts.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’When I leave there, I tell my trainer: “I hate you so much.” But then the next week I can lift even more. He’s very good.What does your recovery look like?Sitting here on the couch like a slug. The only thing I do every day is I walk for at least half an hour, just to keep the old body moving. But rest is as important as the actual lifting.Well, good luck in Cape Town!I’m feeling pretty confident. Training’s going well. Everything’s feeling really good. As long as I don’t mess up.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyWeightliftingAgeingWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)featuresShareReuse this content"

My dad’s 60th, in May last year, was a particularly special one, as we had family travelling from Germany to Eastbourne, in East Sussex, to celebrate.I spent the first part of the morning with my sisters at my mum’s nearby. She has a birthday in the same week, so we were celebrating hers first. Around midday, we decided to go to my dad’s house, a few minutes’ drive away.Two years earlier, at 22, I had got my motorbike licence after spending most of my teens wanting to learn. My dad is a big fan of motorbikes – that’s what inspired me – but my mum was always concerned.That day, I decided to drive my motorbike to my dad’s house. I know his road like the back of my hand – I grew up on it.Experience: I was attacked by a wild tigerRead moreRecalling what happened next is hard. My life changed in a millisecond. As I drove down my dad’s road, just seconds away from his house, a pigeon suddenly flew into my open helmet. I only know this from CCTV footage captured by a neighbour’s door cam. Within a fraction of a second, I’d turned my head, flustered by the bird, and veered straight into a parked Volvo. I started doing cartwheels in the air, smacking my head on the ground when I landed and skidded down the road into a kerb.My mum and two sisters arrived a couple of minutes after, to find bike parts scattered along the road and me lying motionless. My younger sister was screaming and crying, and sprinted to get my dad. Luckily, a lot of my family have medical training: my dad is a trauma and army doctor, my older sister is a hospital doctor and my mum a GP.Dad told me that my pupils were dilated, and I was blue, unresponsive and bleeding out from internal and external injuries. He said that my face was so smashed up, you could fit an entire finger in the wounds. He almost refuses to talk about it now.An ambulance arrived within minutes. The paramedics refused to remove my helmet, for fear of exacerbating a spinal injury, but my dad shouted that he’d rather me be in a wheelchair than dead, and removed it anyway.View image in fullscreenMercedes Valentine in East Sussex.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianWhen I woke up in Brighton hospital one week later, my entire memory of the accident was gone, as were any recollections of my life a month before that day. I was told I had been in an accident, and was terrified and confused when the doctors listed my injuries. My skull was smashed, I had two bleeds on my brain, I had lost three litres of blood, my pelvis had shattered, my back was fractured in six places. I had a broken shoulder, four broken ribs, a broken finger, broken knee, internal bleeding and my bladder had been filled with blood.I watched the CCTV footage repeatedly,and looked through scans and photos from surgeries to try to piece together what happened, but it didn’t feel real. I needed three surgeries alone just to fix my pelvis. I’d already had an eye operation, which I don’t remember.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I couldn’t even go to the toilet by myself and needed constant care. It was devastating to see how sad my family was. My dad still refuses to watch the footage, and my mum and sister said they would sit in my room and cry about how scared they were that I wouldn’t make it.Doctors called me a medical miracle after my six-month recovery, but I still have pelvic, facial nerve and brain damage. Though I was nervous about it, I now regularly get back on my motorbike. It needed a lot of adjustments – my legs are different lengths now due to my pelvis break. I don’t drive on the road any more, but I continue doing what I love by using motorbike tracks. And I look at pigeons a bit differently now. In a way they remind me that I’m lucky to be alive.The biggest lesson I have learned from this is that protective gear is really important. My helmet cost more than £1,000, and if it hadn’t been such good quality, I wouldn’t be alive. One thing is for certain – I now value birthdays and time spent with my family more than ever.As told to Elizabeth McCaffertyDo you have an experience to share?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, there are many bike storage solutions, from basic floor anchors for a tiny outdoor space to fancy high-security sheds, and even secure parking provided by local authorities. One cycle storage entrepreneurwon £100,000 on Dragons’ Denfor his SpaceRail. Here are some of the best options I’ve come across, for inside the home, and out.The best bike storage ideasOutdoorsFor bikes parked outdoors, if security is one of your requirements (which it probably should be, even in a back garden), look for products that are Sold Secure rated: this means they are rigorously tested and certified to resist theft.Also, a word of warning if you’re thinking of installing a shed: metal ones heat up in the sun, so don’t allow any part of the bike that could melt (handlebars or tyres) to touch metal in full summer sun. Strategically place cloths between the two, or install insulation.For front or rear gardensView image in fullscreenThe fortress£915 at AsgardIf you’re lucky enough to have a front or rear garden, Asgard sheds are safe, good-looking and sturdy.Pricesstart at £649 for a two-bike shed. I tested the mammoth Annexe Plus E (for e-bike charging) in my front garden, which is Secured by Design (police) approved, and rated by the Loss Prevention Certification Board (LPCB) for security, which means it was tested using a plethora of break-in tools.The Plus E stores three to four bikes (essential: check your bike sizes first), with optional plug sockets for charging, shelves and hooks for gear. For an additional fee, Asgard’s staff will come and build it for you. I wasn’t sure I’d want to leave my expensive bikes in the front garden, but found the shed reassuringly safe, with its five-point locking double doors, including two deadbolts.The design details are great, with ventilation to prevent damp buildup, and it’s big enough to obscure my neighbours’ overflowing bins. It also weighs 176kg (27st 10lb), so it isn’t going anywhere easily. I’m still learning not to make too much noise opening and closing it.View image in fullscreenThe lifting-lid shed£629.99 at Shedstore£629.99 at Buy Sheds DirectTrimetals’ bike sheds are sturdy and well made but aren’t Secured by Design or LPCB rated, and you need separate padlocks to secure them when closed. The 6ft 4in x 2ft 9in (193 x 88cm) model will store up to three adult bikes, and comes with a 25-year panel guarantee. This one has a spring-assisted lid that lifts both the roof and front of the shed to save ducking while getting bikes in and out. However, dealing with two padlocks may prove a faff in the rain, or if you’re in a hurry – and the floor is sold separately (£89.99).For less fortress-like shed models, you can fit a special metal anchor to a solid floor and chain the bike to that – using the best-quality lock you can afford (see below).View image in fullscreenThe simple wooden shed£434 at Powersheds£445 at WickesThere are plenty of cheap wooden sheds available for £200-£300, but it’s worth forking out the extra for something decent if you can.Cycle insurer Bikmo recommendsbuying a tongue-and-groove model as overlapping wooden styles are flimsier and can warp, letting in the weather and thieves. Internal hinges are preferable because they prevent thieves from simply unscrewing them.Middle of the range is the Apex Bike Shed from Powersheds, which starts at £434 for the 6 x 2ft (183 x 61cm) model. This should store two bikes, but as ever, do check your bike sizes before buying. Powersheds products come with a 10-year guarantee, galvanised metal parts and extra-wide doors for easy access – although the hinges are on the outside.View image in fullscreenThe fancy wooden shedFrom £1,512 at the Bike Shed CompanyThe Bike Shed Company offers premium wooden sheds for up to five adult bikes, as well as off-the-shelf and bespoke wooden buildings for gardens. The cheapest model, the Pedalbase 2, fits two bikes (again: check your own bike size against the shed measurements). As well as doors, the roof opens and stays open with gas struts – making it easy to lift the roof up high. There’s even amodel shaped to fit beside a bay window. The timber is sustainably grown in the UK from FSC-accredited forests.The on-street solutionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nathaniel Noir/AlamyLucky you if you can get a shared on-street cycle-parking space near your home, as most councils don’t offer them and waitlists can be long. Thesehemi-cylindrical shared bike sheds, popping up in London, Bristol, Salford,Brighton, Edinburgh and Glasgow, are popular and efficient, fitting six bikes in the equivalent of one car’s parking space. A handful of companies make them, councils install them, and residents rent them. In London, one of these spotscost an average of £57.90 a yearin 2022.They’re popular: in Bristol, 40 new hangars werealmost fully booked within 90 minutes. In Waltham Forest, 4,305 people were on the waiting list in June, with 150 new applications a month on average (the council plans to provide another 300 units in the next year).You can join a waiting list solo or lobby the council with neighbours. Alternatively, if enough people contact manufacturers, such as Cyclehoop, they’ll let your council know there is demand. There’s even ajumbo model for cargo bikesand non-standard cycles.Anchors away!A minimalist solution for a small outdoor space, say an alleyway or similar, is a metal floor or wall anchor that you can cement or drill holes and fix into place, attaching a chain through your bike and the loop. Checkherefor Sold Secure-approved ground anchors. Then you can choose whether to throw a cover on the bike to protect it from the elements (see below).View image in fullscreenDiamond-secure£63.84 at Halfords£56.99 at AmazonThe Ankr by Hiplok is pricey, but it’s Sold Secure Diamond rated – the top bike security rating from the benchmark for quality bike protection. For your money, you get a “maximum security” steel ground and wall anchor for a bicycle or motorcycle. A rubberised cap helps prevent frame damage, and there’s a 10-year warranty. Perfect if your bike thieves are particularly determined, and/or armed with angle grinders.View image in fullscreenSilver-secure£25 at Argos£19.99 at AmazonThe Anchor10 from Oxford Locks is a Sold Secure Silver-rated wall and floor anchor made from hardened steel. Design features include bolts protected by a ball bearing that are covered when a lock is in place to evade theft. It’s been “five-minute-attack tested”, manufacturers say.The outdoor bike coverWhile it’s not ideal to leave your bike exposed to the elements, sometimes outdoors is the only option. Dutch cyclists leave theirs out all year round, as a rule. Bike covers come in various designs and price points and can be a low-cost solution to minimise rust and wear. Cheap options start at less than a tenner, and exceed £70 for premium covers for larger cycles. A price point somewhere in between is probably your best bet.View image in fullscreenThe classy overcoat£39.30 at SantafixieThe BikeParka Stash is a classy, fitted cover that hugs your bike’s front and rear wheels, with extra cinch straps to avoid water gathering. As a rider of medium-sized bikes, I found two that fit under one cover. Made from ripstop waterproof material, it features sealed seams, adjustable toggles and brass eyelets to help keep your bike snug and dry. As with all covers, beware of windy days: mine became a sail and my bikes fell over, scratching each other. There’s also acargo bike parka for £85.70and along tail bike with seats coverfor £79.95. Use it mostly in the winter months, and it’ll last longer (less UV damage), but BikeParka guarantees it for one year in full sun and more than three in the shade. Colleagues say theirs have lasted several years outdoors, compared with months for cheaper products – imagine leaving a tent out 24/7, while regularly wrestling it on and off an awkward metal object, for comparison.View image in fullscreenThe sturdy skin£60 at Stormskin£60 at AmazonStormSkin’s premium cover is bulky, and it will set you back, but it’s sturdy and will resist all but the most determined horizontal water spray. Reviewers have found it the most protective at-home cover (though it’s not especially portable, due to its size), with slits for bike locks, front and rear, so you can secure it at a bike stand.The heavy-duty backpack fabric is, StormSkin says, up to nine times thicker than rivals’ products, and made from 100% recycled fabric. It looks good too, with a palm print pattern. It just takes a while to get the bike all tucked in.View image in fullscreenThe budget option£18.99 at TredzThe Oxford Aquatex cover is a budget pick, but still a good choice to protect your steed(s) from the elements. There are three sizes, fitting up to three bikes inside. Made from 100-denier polyester, double-stitched, it’s a no-frills option, with no cinch pulls, just an elasticated bottom. It’s roomy enough for a larger bike, but this also means it flaps around in the wind more. If you have a pigeon or rook problem, perhaps it could double as a scarer.IndoorsThere are plenty of hooks and shelving systems available for storing bikes indoors, on a wall. Pretend your bike is a piece of art; maybe it is. Many of the below would also work in a garage or sturdy wooden shed.View image in fullscreenTyre hook£15 at Halfords£15.99 at HornitThe smallest bike hook is the tiny plastic Clug, from Hornit. The manufacturer claims installation is as easy as putting up a picture – with two screws – although it leaves one wheel on the floor. It’s a smart and popular option, and means you can also line up your bikes, like books on a shelf. Measure your tyre width before ordering one of the five sizes (23-32mm to 70-81mm). Make sure your tyres stay pumped, or the bike could fall – or go for theClug Pro, which holds the wheel in place with a small, strong thread and magnets. Mud pads are available to protect walls.View image in fullscreenRubber hooks£8.42 at DecathlonFor something simpler, cheaper and more versatile that will fully elevate your bike, simple hooks with rubberised covers are available for a few quid. Asthis YouTuberrecommends, attaching them to a wooden 2 x 4in or 2 x 6in baton rather than directly to your wall offers you stability, longevity and more bikes stored per metre. It will also help minimise damage to your walls from the large screws that accompany these hooks.View image in fullscreenNo-drill options£149.99 at Cyclestore£179.99 at HalfordsTopeak sells a few no-drill bike storage options. For a smaller footprint, the Dual Touch wedges between the floor and ceiling using an adjustable pole with a clever foot pedal clutch. There are mounts for two bikes, stacked in double-decker formation, but it can hold four, weighing up to 72kg, or 18kg a bike – depending on bike size and ceiling height.The key is finding a ceiling joist to wedge it under – I found mine by referring to an old photo from the time the kitchen ceiling fell in. Once installed, the Dual Touch is as sturdy as anything. My e-bike’s step-through frame is too awkwardly shaped, with most of its 25kg weight around the back wheel, so hanging it on two hooks wasn’t possible. My hybrid and road bikes hooked on easily, though. There’s also afree-standing option, with a tripod foot, requiring a little more floor space – popular at bike expos.Laura Laker has been writing about cycling for more than a decade.

There are hundreds to choose from at wildly different prices, some focusing on specific product types, and some filled with a mixture of bestsellers.To help with choice paralysis, I’ve been trawling the shelves for calendars filled with cult favourites suitable for a range of skin types and preferences, narrowing down the nine best beauty Advent calendars of the 2025 season.While these Advent calendars can’t exactly be seen as a net positive for the environment, I also looked at their recyclability and for calendars with the broadest possible appeal, to avoid any wasted products.At a glanceBest beauty Advent calendar overall:Space NK Beauty£260 at Space NKBest value beauty Advent calendar:Lookfantastic beauty Advent calendar£105 at LookfantasticBest for bath lovers:Lush refillable Advent calendar£205 at LushBest for essential makeup and skincare:Boots 24 Beauty Stars premium Advent calendar£150 at BootsBest for product range:Cult Beauty the Classic Curation£240 at Cult BeautyBest entry-level calendar:W7 Beauty Blast Advent calendar£19.95 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI make a living testing health and beauty products, from hair masks andhair dryerstobody moisturisersand concealers. That means I’m more familiar with the best formulations than many beauty fanatics.Testing hundreds of products means I’ve become an expert in all things skincare, hair care and makeup – the main contents of beauty Advent calendars. I also have a certification in cosmetic science, so I know how to identify the best products for specific skin and hair needs. As someone with sensitive skin, I also know which ingredients are likely to irritate, so I’ve only selected calendars where products are suitable for most people – so that nothing goes to waste.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I made sure every calendar in this roundup was made from, and delivered in, domestically recyclable or reusable packaging.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianI judged each beauty Advent calendar on its product range, the broad usefulness of those products to most people, and the quality and sustainability of its packaging. I longlisted 22 of the most popular calendars from department stores and brands, narrowing down my options based on the contents of each calendar. I then shortlisted the 13 calendars with the best product range and value for money to test at home.Getting hands on with each calendar gave me a better idea of how it is packaged and delivered, its quality and feel, and the merits and size of the products inside. From a sustainability perspective, I made sure every calendar in this roundup was made from, and delivered in, domestically recyclable or reusable packaging.The goodies inside the calendars generally came in packaging that can be recycled at home, but all can otherwise be taken to one of many cosmetic recycling schemes, where pumps, sprays and bottles can be recycled properly. These include Space NK’s collaboration withHandle, and theRecycle at Boots scheme, which gets you extra points on your Advantage card for every empty you return.Most Advent calendars are designed to have broad appeal, but I also assessed how useful each selection of products would be. For makeup, that meant looking for neutral, wearable shades, rather than wild fluorescent colours. For hair care, I looked for formulas that help condition and improve all hair, rather than a specific hair type. I also liked to see gentler skin care products that help with common skin concerns, such as dullness, hydration levels and barrier health, although I didn’t mind an occasional anti-ageing product or spot treatment as these also have a wide appeal.Testing 13 Advent calendars left me with more cosmetics and products than I could ever feasibly use. In instances where I wouldn’t or couldn’t use something from inside the calendars, I donated samples to theRedbridge Reach Outdomestic abuse service, where they could be given to women and young people seeking refuge from domestic violence. If you end up with products you won’t use, it’s always worth looking for a local beauty bank that will take donations, or give items to friends and family.Here are the nine beauty Advent calendars that came out on top in my tests.Our favourite beauty Advent calendars in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest beautyAdvent calendar overall:Space NK BeautyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£260 at Space NKLuxury beauty retailer Space NK has been at the forefront of high-end skincare, body care, hair care and makeup since its inception. Its 2025 beauty Advent calendar covers all these bases, with 35 cult favourites to last you well into 2026. With 26 full-size products from big-name brands, this is a seriously good beauty haul.Why we love itWith full-size makeup from Hourglass, Rare Beauty and Charlotte Tilbury; hair care from K18 and Olaplex; and skincare from Paula’s Choice and Laneige, this calendar will keep even the fussiest beauty fanatics happy.It’s especially strong for skincare, with two full-size cleansers, a Medik8 Liquid Peptides serum, a Paula’s Choice pro-collagen peptide moisturiser and the new Inkey List Ectoin Hydro-barrier serum. None of these is likely to cause problems for most people’s skin.In the mix you’ll also find hair care from Dyson, Augustinus Bader retinol serum and the popular Colour Wow Dream Coat – a powerful styling spray, good for adding shine to unruly hair. Add in two mini perfumes to chuck in your handbag, and you’ve got a selection that’s hard to beat.Better still, the packaging is fully recyclable, so you can pop the calendar in your normal recycling bin. Space NK has also partnered withHandle, a company that recycles beauty empties. So if you have a Space NK store or other Handle drop-off location nearby, you can drop off the empties from the calendar, along with any others, and they’ll take care of the rest.It’s a shame that …it’s pretty expensive, and the hair accessory included was absolutely no match for my thick hair. You can forget doing full up-dos with this, but half-up-half-down styles are definitely achievable.Number of products:35 (26 full size, 9 mini)Overall value:approx £1,150Packaging:domestically recyclableBest value beauty Advent calendar:Lookfantastic beauty Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£105 at LookfantasticMany of the Advent calendars in this roundup justify their steep prices by including high numbers of full-size products, while the cheaper options tend to be mostly stocked with minis. The Lookfantastic calendar bucks this trend, offering 17 full-size products and 11 minis for less than half the price of the Space NK calendar we’ve included.Why we love itInside the drawers, you’ll find a balance of indulgent skincare, body care essentials, universally useful makeup, hair care and accessories. Highlights include a Medik8 Hydr8 B5 Intense serum, which gently hydrates and plumps winter-stressed skin, and the Ren CleanSkincareRadiance eye cream, which helps minimise the appearance of dark circles – perfect for mornings when you’ve burned the candle at both ends.There is a 75ml Color Wow shampoo and conditioner set, as well as a mini hydrating, smoothing Wella hair mask that helps nourish stressed out hair. Makeup-wise, there are three subtle pink-toned lip products from Mac, a full-size Revolution eyeshadow palette and a creamy Glow Hub blush stick. These shades are pigmented enough to work on all skin tones, and can be set in place using the full-size Iconic London Prep Set Blur setting spray.Among these beauty goodies, you’ll find a Sol de Janeiro perfume mist and a White Company candle. I also love that you get two towelling wristbands, which I use to stop water dripping down my arms when I cleanse my face – essential in winter if you want to stop any wet sleeve-induced meltdowns.It’s a shame that …much of the full-size skincare in this calendar is for improving hydration – you won’t find many targeted retinol or vitamin C products here. That said, most people can benefit from extra hydration in the colder months, so this isn’t a huge pitfall.Number of products:28 (17 full size, 11 mini)Overall value:£655Packaging:domestically recyclableBest for bath lovers:Lush refillable Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£205 at LushIf your favourite part of the day is bath time, or you’re hoping to buy an Advent calendar the whole family can enjoy, this colourful option from Lush is my pick. Lush releases a few calendars each year, but this refillable chest is my recommendation: it’s perfect for storing your Lush products, and can be refilled for less money (and packaging) when the brand releases its 2026 calendar next year.Why we love itLush is most known for its fun, freshly made bath bombs – this calendar comes with bombs and bubble bars. Some have sweet scents, others are spiced; all of them are vegan and cruelty-free. If you’re a Lush lover, you’ll have no trouble working your way through this haul.You’ll also get four festive shower gels, two body lotions – including my longtime favourite festive Lush scent, Yog Nog – two soaps, a perfume and a lip scrub. For cosy festive evenings, there are also Lush socks and aChristmasEve scented candle – no prizes for guessing which door that is hiding behind.This year’s refillable calendar was designed in partnership with Artbox London, a charity that runs workshops for people with learning disabilities and neurodivergent artists. Artist Shruti Gadhvi, who designed this year’s box, took inspiration from the practice of meditation, positive affirmations and the flowers and colours she sees on her travels.It’s a shame that …it’s quite expensive and it’s difficult to calculate the overall value since 10 items are exclusive.Number of products:25Overall value:not statedPackaging:refillable or domestically recyclable (bar the ribbon, which can be reused)Best for essential makeup and skincare:Boots 24 Beauty Stars premium Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£150 at BootsBoots’ Advent calendar has a good range of full-size products from big-name brands, such as Drunk Elephant, Nars and Estée Lauder. It may not seem cheap at £150, but it’s filled with buzzy skincare products and makeup most beauty fanatics will want to try. The products inside are worth £612.50.Why we love itIt really looks the part, with a circus-themed chest design that opens to reveal individually wrapped goodies for every day until Christmas Eve. Despite its substantial design, it’s still fully recyclable.Highlights include a full-size viral Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide cream and an Estée Lauder cleansing gel. There’s also a mini-size Elemis cleansing balm – used together, these three make an effective, gentle evening skincare routine most people will love. You’ll also find crowd-pleaser fragrances from Sol de Janeiro and Floral Street.But it’s the makeup that really makes this calendar standout. There are seven full-size makeup products inside: an Iconic London face powder palette, a Fenty liquid lipstick, a Too Faced shimmery lip oil, a Mac lip liner, a Laneige lip balm, Nars light reflecting hydrating primer and a Milk Makeup mini highlighter (the latter of which stretches the meaning of “full size” a little). There are also minis of the Benefit Hoola bronzer, Mac Velvet Teddy lipstick and Laura Mercier loose-setting powder. All staples that will make great additions to any makeup bag.It’s a shame that …there are only two haircare products, so if this is what you’re after, opt for a different calendar.Number of products:25 (17 full size, 8 mini)Overall value:£612.50Packaging:domestically recyclableskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

With 34 products inside 25 drawers, this calendar has skincare favourites to help repair stressed-out winter skin, as well as a few standout makeup products to add to your kit.Why we love itIt’s beautiful to look at, and the recyclable packaging feels sturdy and luxurious. It comes with a solid selection of skincare that should help relieve dryness and plump up sensitive skin. That includes a Summer Fridays hydration mist, a Paula’s Choice barrier repair moisturiser and a Byoma Phyto-Mucin glow serum.Those looking for more targeted skincare will find the Elemis Pro-Collagen toning mist, a Medik8 C-Tetra advanced serum, and the spot-fighting Oil La La serum from Krave. All are useful when a spot pops up, or when your skin needs brightening up after a night on the fizz.For hair care you’ll find a scalp recovery serum from Philip Kingsley, a K18 Molecular Repair hair mask and Hair by Sam McKnight’s Love Me Do nourishing hair oil. Great for hair that’s been depleted by winter.This calendar doesn’t scrimp on makeup, either. Inside, you’ll find a powder blush duo from Patrick Ta, a blush from Saie and a Charlotte Tilbury beauty light wand. There’s also a mini By Terry Hyaluronic Hydra Powder, a translucent powder I recently fell in love with – it sets my makeup in place without drying out my skin.It’s a shame that …while most of the skincare in this calendar is good for sensitive and acne-prone skin, watch out for the Kate Somerville exfoliating mask – it’s highly potent, so can cause irritation if you’re not careful.Number of products:34 (20 full size, 14 mini)Overall value:approx £1,100Packaging:domestically recyclableBestentry-level calendar:W7 Beauty Blast Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£19.95 at W7£19.95 at AmazonThis Advent calendar from W7 is staggeringly cheap compared with the others here. Inside, you’ll find 24 boxes, each filled with bestsellers from the W7 range, including seven full-size products and 19 minis.Why we love itGood beauty Advent calendars are generally pricey, but the products included in the W7 Advent calendar can rival some of the best in the business.All in, the product selection here is pretty useful for most people – I can’t see any makeup lovers struggling to include these in their routine. I particularly love the brand’s lip liners – you’ll get two in this calendar – and its H2O loose powder sets makeup without causing dryness. Also included is a mini Honolulu Sun Rays bronzer, famously similar to the Benefit Hoola bronzer. Another highlight is the Edgy mascara, which has a curved wand to help lift and curl the lashes as well as biotin, castor oil and vitamin B5 to condition the lashes.The travel-size eyeshadows, primers, lip balms, eye creams and liquid blushes are perfect if you’re just starting out with makeup and want to try new formulations and styles without remortgaging your home. For the cost, this calendar is perfect for those hoping to try out new, budget-friendly products.It’s a shame that …it’s mainly filled with travel minis, though this is perhaps expected given the price.Number of products:24 (7 full size, 17 mini)Overall value:not listedPackaging:domestically recyclableThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianSentier Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£99 at SentierBest for:fragrance loversThis 12-day calendar (designed for the 12 days of Christmas, so not strictly Advent) from Sentier comes with a range of perfumes and candles to see you through the festive season. It’s beautifully designed and surprisingly well priced considering how long-lasting and potent the scents are.Sentier describes the box it comes in as “meticulously crafted”. It’s certainly the most distinctive calendar of the lot, with doors and drawers opening in unexpected directions to reveal what’s inside.In the box, you’ll get six 10ml alcohol-free scents in pretty glass bottles. In my experience, each scent was distinct, wearable and versatile enough to layer, making them perfect for popping in a handbag. You’ll also get six scented candles, each 60ml in size. I found that these wafted scent around my flat beautifully.It didn’t make the final cut because …there’s a soft foam included in the bottom of each drawer, to keep the candle safe. This isn’t recyclable, despite the box being mainly made from card.Number of products:12;overall value:£516;packaging:not fully recyclableBamford ultimate Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£300 at BamfordBest for:self-care and wellbeingIf you’re into baths and self-care rituals but have more refined taste (and a higher budget) than Lush, this celestial-themed Advent calendar from Bamford is a more indulgent option. It comes with a whole host of Bamford favourites, including 13 full-size products and 11 minis to help you wind down during the hectic festive period.In the full-size collection, you’ll find the brand’s bestselling perfume mist, two candles, body oil, bath oil and relaxing bath salts. In mini-size, you’ll find a range of body washes, lotions and hair care – less environmentally friendly perhaps, but handy to take on your travels over Christmas.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s very expensive. And its ratio of full-size to mini products could be better, considering the price.Number of products:24 (13 full size, 11 mini);overall value:approx £600;packaging:domestically recyclableDiptyque Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£399 at DiptyqueBest for:luxury fragranceDiptyque is the first brand that comes to mind when I think of luxury fragrance, and its 2025 Advent calendar has a huge selection of its bestselling fragrances packed in. That’s both mini and full-size candles, seven different perfumes, and a hand cream, an oil and soaps to make your festive season smell great.It’s also one of the most beautiful designs I’ve tried out this year, with a book-shaped box that opens to reveal 25 smaller boxes adorned with book illustrations and the signature Diptyque cat. It will look great surrounded by Christmas decorations throughout December, though its good looks come at a luxury price point.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s expensive, with more reasonably priced competition, and there’s no indication of the calendar’s overall value. That said, perfume fans with deep pockets will love it.Number of products:25;overall value:not stated;packaging:about 90% recyclable; only one drawer has polystyrene in itWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianAre beauty Advent calendars worth it?This depends. If your beauty routine is in need of a refresh and you want to try lots of new products, beauty Advent calendars allow you to do that for a reduced price.Case in point: the Space NK listed above has 35 products with a total value of £1,150. It costs £260, so in theory saves you £890.However, if you have a set beauty routine that works, then the mixed calendars might not be worth it. In this case, a scent-based or body-care Advent calendar may be more suitable as the products are less specific; a series of treats to enjoy rather than a whole new routine.How much should you expect to spend?Beauty Advent calendars can cost anything from £20 to £500 (or more), so there’s something to suit every budget. At the lower end of the scale, you can expect to find calendars from high-street brands, often with mini-size products inside. The packaging on these calendars is likely to be flimsier.Move up to the £100-£200 price range and you can dip your toes into high-end brand calendars, or the department store Advent calendars, which contain a mix of bestselling products from a range of brands. The latter might work best if you’re buying a calendar as a gift, especially if you don’t know which brands the recipient likes best.At the top end of the scale, you’ll find beauty Advent calendars from exclusive high-end brands, usually containing mostly full-size products. Packaging for these calendars is typically more sculptural and eye-catching, but they also come with a high price tag of more than £200.Why are beauty Advent calendars released so early?Planning, organising and launching an Advent calendar takes a long time. Think about how many products are included in the major beauty retailer’s calendar. Then think about how much organisation it takes to coordinate with each brand on products to fit in each Advent calendar window. Add on to that marketing materials and imagery, and you’ve got a project that starts production almost as soon as the new year hits.Typically, brands release their calendars so early because it allows them to anticipate how much stock they need to order. As I’m writing this piece in August, many have already opened their waitlists, which helps them gauge how much interest there is in the calendar before it drops. When calendars go on sale in the autumn, it’s usually the case that when stock sells out, it’s gone for good.Sarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who can’t quite believe she gets to spend her days reviewing beauty products.

First, I’ve rarely seena more exuberant bunch of models– all unpaid volunteers living their best lives. Second, everything was secondhand, from a charity shop calledSecond Lifein East Sussex. And third, half of it was sold that day, even the damaged pieces. Second Life’s annual fashion show, held over the summer, is just one of the creative ways the shop keeps its harder-to-sell clothing out ofincinerators, landfill anddeveloping countries’ illegal dumps.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This “buy direct from the catwalk” concept is something charities are increasingly adopting. At London fashion week this month, Oxfam’s show, styled by thrift queen Bay Garnett, saw pop star Sam Ryder, activist Katie Piper and costume designer Sandy Powell take to the catwalk in preloved boiler suits, capes and wedding dresses, which went on sale at itsVinted shopsoon after.Charity Super.Mkt, a multi-charity department store for preloved fashion, hosts what it calls People’s Catwalks at festivals – the outfits are created from damaged garments, surplus stock and offcuts – and forSustainable fashion week, the Salvation Army is holding a fashion show in its Swansea donation centre on 2 October. All the looks will be available to buy immediately afterwards.Second Life doesn’t stop at catwalk shows, either – it also overdyes clothes to spruce them up, collaborates with local designers to upcycle clothing, and runs workshops where volunteers make bags out of tired T-shirts, purses out of knackered jeans and dungarees out of duvet covers.It’s a great blueprint for charity shops, which are overwhelmed with unsaleable, low-quality donations: “Anecdotally, only about a third of [donations] are sold across the counter,” reports Robin Osterley, CEO of the Charity Retail Association.View image in fullscreenCharity catwalk … Second Life’s fashion shows are helping to find homes for even hard-to-shift items.Photograph: Gala KononenkoThat low quality is partly because consumers are “cherry-picking” the best clothes to sell on Vinted, says Dawn Dungate, an independent consultant who advises charities on textile recycling. “Whatever doesn’t sell is dropped on the charities to deal with.” I found as much when I rummaged through Second Life’s unsold-clothing heap – each week, its 1,100-litre wheelie bin is “filled to bursting”, says manager Naomi Phitidis.Thankfully, our ever-resourceful charity shops are doing their bit to innovate their way through fashion’soverproduction problem. “There’s been a distinct rise in creativity,” notes Dungate, which she says stems from a younger workforce. “The old generation was very much, ‘This is what we do, and we don’t deviate from it.’ But now you can’t afford not to think outside the box.”When Havens Hospices, a chain of more than 25 charity shops across Essex, experienced a sales downturn due to increased costs and competition from Vinted and Depop, it launched designer upcycling collabs with a local designer and introduced £12mystery bags, which contain four items of the same dress size, themed to specific aesthetics such as cottagecore, Y2K or, simply, black. They sent some to influencers, whose haul videos then powered sales. Mystery bags are also available atIsabel Hospice’s eBay store, Fara’s shop in Greenford, London, Age UK from November, and, for Christmas, the Salvation Army.“Nobody in this business wants to send stuff to waste,” says Osterley. “They want to reuse clothing rather than chuck it away.” Plus, he says, these different ways of dealing with old clothes deliver “a much better income than rag” – clothes and textiles not suitable for resale – and spare charities from “paying to throw stuff away”.Of course, solvingfashion’s waste problemshouldn’t be down to the creative thinking of charities. Campaigning groups such asthe Or FoundationandFashion Revolutioncontinue to urge the industry to take more responsibility. In the meantime, we’re lucky to have our charity shops. “So many have upped their game beautifully,” says Mary Portas, who disrupted the sector 15 years ago with Mary’s Living & Giving shops. “They’re no longer seen as a blight on the high street, but a beacon. I don’t take anything other than hope from this.”Here are some of the other, clever ways that charity shops are keeping our old clothes in circulation.1.Mending and mend-me railsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In May, Sue Ryder launched Perfectly Imperfect – look for the purple stickers detailing clothes’ minor flaws and cheap prices. Similarly, this monthShelterhas launched its Rescue and Repair range of discounted clothing with small imperfections, featuring QR codes that customers can scan to find repair guides. Meanwhile, Fara has introduced Mend-Me rails – easy-to-fix, high-end high-street bargains (for example, Jigsaw, Reiss, Whistles) at its store in Streatham, south London, and damaged designer pieces (McQueen, Gucci, Chanel) at its Angel one.2. Kilo sales and fill-a-bag daysIt’s a win-win – charities get to sell what they’d otherwise scrap, while we get a bargain.St Oswald’s Hospicein Newcastle upon Tyne hosts monthly kilo sales (£2 per kilo);Phyllis Tuckwell Hospice Care’s monthly kilo sales, in Farnborough, Surrey, run all week (£7.50 per kilo); andSt Wilfrid’s Hospicein West Sussex hosts regular fill-a-bag sales for £10. Take a tape measure, though, as these flash sales often have no changing rooms.3. Star powerWhen you see cardboard cutouts of Ed Sheeran in the windows of his local Suffolk charity shop, you know that celebrity donations are no longer a closely guarded secret. East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices have raised more than £50,000 from Sheeran’s donations, which even include his pants. This month, donations from Martin Freeman, Sharon Horgan and Patrick Grant, among others, are dropping across Traid’s 12 London stores. And in December, look out for celebrity donations at Crisis’sChristmas pop-up shopin London; last year it featured donations from Kate Moss, Daniel Craig and Liam Gallagher.4.

Dense yet tender, plush with fruit and rich with toffee, it’s simple enough for a weekend pudding, and special enough to be served at a gathering.Toffee apple pudding cakePrep10 minCook1 hr 30 minCool30 min+Serves8125g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra, softened, for greasing200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting2 small apples, preferably granny smith150g small, firm dried figs, chopped into roughly 1cm pieces1 tsp bicarbonate of soda2 tsp baking powder½ tsp ground cinnamon¼ tsp fine sea salt200g light muscovado sugar1 large egg1 tsp vanilla extractFor the toffee apple topping3 small apples, preferably granny smith100g unsalted butter100g light brown muscovado sugar1 tsp lemon juice100mldouble cream¼ tsp flaky sea saltGrease a 23cm bundt tin thoroughly with the extra softened butter, then dust some flour all over the inside. Rotate to coat tin entirely, then turn upside down and tap firmly over a bin to remove the excess flour. Set aside in a cool place.Peel, core and cut the apples into roughly 1cm dice (you will need 200g diced flesh), then place in a medium saucepan. Add the chopped figs and 250ml water, put on a medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fruit breaks down and most of the liquid has evaporated – the mix should remain moist and spoonable, not dry. Stir in the bicarb then take off the heat and leave to cool to room temperature.Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/380F/gas 5½. Sift the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt into a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment on medium-high for about two minutes, until lightened. Add the egg and vanilla, beat until just combined, then turn down the speed to low and, in alternate batches, add the sifted dry ingredients and the apple-fig mix.Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool for at least 30 minutes, then invert the cake on to a serving plate.Meanwhile, make the toffee apples. Peel, core and quarter the apples, then cut each quarter into four. Put a tablespoon of the butter and two tablespoons of the sugar in a large saute pan, add the apples and lemon juice, then cook, stirring regularly, over a medium heat for eight to 10 minutes, until the apples soften and turn golden. Add the remaining butter and sugar, stir to melt, then add the cream and salt, and stir gently to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for one or two minutes, until thick and glossy. Take off the heat and spoon the apples all over the top of the cake. Serve with cream or creme fraiche.Baking and the Meaning of Life by Helen Goh (Murdoch Books, £26).

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.On a week-long trip to Paris last year, I racked up nearly $100 in data charges on my iPhone, with taxes and fees. Ditto for a separate, eight-day trip to Spain, which was even more pricey. And, in what I now jokingly call an act of piracy, my three-week trip to seven countries – including a seven-day cruise – cost me over $300 for data.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I (eventually) learned my lesson, and a little research yielded a simple solution that can make life a lot easier: Switching to a local carrier for your travels. This used to entail a visit to an airport kiosk or a mobile store to get a fingernail-sized plastic SIM chip installed in your phone, but a new feature called an eSIM lets you handle it all from your phone before you even leave. My eSim for Paris cost $11 for 5GB of data, plenty for checking emails, using Google Maps, and browsing social media (although I was careful not to upload photos until I had wifi access). In Spain, I spent $10 for 5GB.Here’s how it works, and how to use it on your next trip abroad.How eSims workView image in fullscreenPhotograph: CandyRetriever/Getty ImagesI got burned by roaming charges, which occur when you use cellular data outside of your home country. You can easily turn off roaming before youtravel, but then you’ll only be able to text and surf on wifi.An eSim is a temporary electronic add-on to your phone that lets you buy affordable short-term cell coverage on local carriers when you travel. You can buy individual eSim for each country from local carriers like Vodafone in the UK or Telcel in Mexico, but it’s much easier to use one of the new crop of apps that do all the heavy lifting for you.View image in fullscreenThe Airalo app.Composite: Courtesy of AiraloThree popular companies that offer eSims for international travel areAiralo(which I have used, and who provided some useful information for this article),SailyandHolafly. All three cover most popular destinations, and vary for more obscure locations. I recently traveled to Bhutan, for instance, and only Airalo had coverage there. Saily can sometimes be marginally cheaper than the others, but it’s worth checking all three. Holafly offers unlimited data only, so it’s a bit more expensive if you don’t need that.Skip Apple’s new iPhone – five tips to make your old phone feel new againRead moreMost phones newer than about 2021 accept eSims, but if you’re not sure, Airalo maintains acompatibility listthat makes it easy to check. You will also need to ensure your phone is unlocked, which typically means you’re not making payments on it to your carrier. In the event you are, most carriers will unlock it when the phone is paid off, either automatically, online, or with a phone call.Setup and picking a planView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Debalina Ghosh/Getty ImagesInstalling your eSim varies a bit depending on the provider, but they all make it easy: Just download the app and follow the instructions. It isn’t difficult, but there are a few steps involved, and you’re better off doing it before you leave for your trip. All of the providers listed offer support if you get into trouble, either on the website or through the app.Since most eSims only provide data and not voice service, you’ll need to use WhatsApp or other apps to make calls. If you do need a local number, Airalo has a package called Discovery+ that allows you to make voice calls and is available in more than 130 destinations.I travel 200,000 miles a year. This is the best travel backpack I can’t leave home withoutRead moreHow much data should you get? If you’re only going to check email, send a few texts a day, and do light web browsing and social media, 3GB to 5GB should be enough for a week trip. The 5GB plan I purchased for six days in Spain was more than enough. But I used wifi when downloading photos or streaming, and didn’t make any calls. If you intend to stream videos, peruse Instagram and make video calls, you might need closer to 10GB. If you game online, need video conferencing for work, download a lot of large photos and stream in HD, you could need even more.Once you’re all loaded up you can head out on your next adventure without worrying – well, at least not about your phone!Explore more on these topicsLife and stylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The scenic coastal path that runs along the Brittany coast winds through woodlands and secluded coves. A swim in the clear water and then on to the restaurantLa Guinguette des Marmouznear Plouër-sur-Rance. The best chips we’ve ever had in a very laid-back spot along the estuary.

It’s only a short bike ride or bus journey from Gouda, famous for its cheese but with a good town market and also the home ofstroopwafels(syrup waffles).

My tip: spend a Saturday eating entirely from thecity-wide market– Normandy cider, fizzing with crisp and juicy apples; the freshest oysters, shucked before your eyes and eaten right there and then; and topped off, of course, with the famous Normandy cheeses camembert and Pont-l’Évêque. It’s France at its best.AaronPicos and tapas in Santander, SpainView image in fullscreenPlaya de Matalenas, SantanderPhotograph: Tamara Kulikova/AlamyHop on a ferry fromPlymouth to Santander(with a spot of whale watching en route). Twenty hours later, the rugged cliffs and crashing waves of northern Spain struck us as reminiscent of the Cornish coast, and temperatures were delightful – warm and sunny but not too hot. Despite its beauty and golden sand city beaches, fantastic seafood and tapas, Santander doesn’t feel particularly touristy. With easy access to the prehistoricEl Castillo cave paintings, Picos de Europa national park and the bustling Bilbao, this is an ideal ferry break.EloiseGreat scoff in Roscoff, BrittanyView image in fullscreenThe harbour at Roscoff.Photograph: Image Broker/AlamyRoscoff,overnight from Plymouth, is a great destination in Brittany. The old town is lovely with a good boulangerie (open early, just as you get off the ferry) and an ancient harbour. We drove 40 minutes south-east to stay on the coast near Morlaix, another old town with an amazing viaduct, lovely bars, creperies and fantastic museums. Also nearby, atBarnenez, is the oldest and one of the largest burial cairns in Europe, an amazing place with panoramic views of the coast.

Locals and Parisians enjoy promenading with parasols, so my husband and I joined them – and felt like we were in a gentle Renoir painting.

With a journey time of around 30 hours, there’s plenty of time to relax and watch the Bay of Biscay go by (we saw whales and dolphins, as well as a beautiful Atlantic sunset). Once you arrive in Bilbao it’s fairly obvious you should check out theGuggenheim, wander the old town and eat pintxos. But it’s also really worthwhile to take aboat trip up the riverto see where the urban regeneration stops and where there are reminders of the city’s industrial heritage.KatieThe mini-Amsterdam with a buzzView image in fullscreenLeiden is like a smaller scale version of Amsterdam, says our reader.Photograph: Martin Bergsma/AlamyLeiden – between the Hook of Holland and Amsterdam – is a fantastic destination easily reached by ferry, whether from Newcastle, Hull, Harwich or Dover. It offers everything Amsterdam does but on a smaller scale and with canals visitors can enjoy. It’s easily reached by road and rail, and has great places to stay, eat and enjoy. The mainly pedestrianised and historic town centre is beautiful, with a fantastic Saturday market along the canals. The large student population gives it a really nice buzz, all year round.Ruud Jansen VenneboerWinning tip: Newhaven to Dieppe and football in Le HavreView image in fullscreenLe Havre fans ramp up the atmosphere at a home match.Photograph: Lou Benoist/Getty ImagesMy teenage boys and I went fromNewhaven, East Sussex, to Dieppe, Normandy, in late August. We found Dieppe to be a smart resort town with some great cafes, restaurants, history. Then it was on to Le Havre to catch the Ligue 1 football match between Le Havre AC and Nice. The home team’s club song is the same tune as God Save the King – chosen by the expat Brits who formed the club in 1872. The atmosphere in the Stade Océane was fantastic – we stood in the home end with the (friendly) ultras, waving flags and singing songs.

Tyler Robinson, the man who’s accused of killing Charlie Kirk, allegedly engraved his bullet casings with “Hey fascist! Catch!” and “Bella ciao.” Authorities say the man who’s suspected of opening fire at an US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Texas this week wrote “Anti-Ice” on his bullet casings.While investigators have long scoured manifestos, online interactions and comments to establish what led someone to shoot others on campuses, nightclubs and in places of worship, messages written on shell casings and firearm magazines are adding to the materials law enforcement, reporters and researchers pour over after an incident.It’s an ongoing phenomenon that shooters seek to leave their final messages behind to be regurgitated in the national news and, in some cases, send signals to the digital communities they are embedded in, said Jonathan Lewis, a research fellow at the program for extremism at The George Washington University.“They want people to go on Fox News and say, ‘if you’re reading this you’re gay,’” they want this to be their moment in the sun,” he said. “Not only is it an ‘I did it,’ it’s an, ‘I did it for my guys. I’m wearing my team’s jersey so everyone knows.’“Bullet inscriptions, manifestos, the use of wearing a skull mask or other iconography: it’s all performative.”There are some historic analogies. Second world war soldierswrote messageson artillery shells, and in more recent history, Americans have paid to have bespoke noteswritten on Ukrainian bombsmeant to be fired at Russian forces and in 2024,Nikki Haley wrotethe phrase “finish them” on an Israeli artillery shell.But Lewis cites the 2019 shooting at two New Zealand mosques as a watershed moment for the most recent wave of shooters writing on shell casings or guns that will later be discovered by authorities. “When you trace it back you can look at the Christchurch shooting as a moment where this trend really emerged out of containment, out of these online spaces,”After 51 people were killed and across two New Zealand mosques in March 2019, investigators found a rifle scrawled with white supremist memes. Three years later a shooter who killed 10 Black people and injured three others in Tops grocery store in Buffalo, New York left behind several rifles with nazi symbols, including some of the same markings used in the New Zealand massacres, and references to racist descriptions of Black people.“They’re very nonsensical if you’re not a part of that online sphere,” said Kristen Elmore-Garcia, a Buffalo-based attorney, who along with her father, John Elmore, is representingone survivorand the family members of three of the victims in lawsuits against the parents of the convicted shooter, 10 tech companies including Meta; Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube; Discord; 4chan; Reddit; and Amazon. They are also suing firearm and gun-accessory retailers RMA Armament, Mean LLC and Vintage Firearms, where the shooter bought his gun.Since the lawsuit began, Elmore-Garcia has had to become a kind of expert in the internet spaces that the Buffalo shooter frequented, she said, including places like 4Chan where she’s seen users call her a “she-boon lawyer”. This experience, she said, has shown her how these phrases and ideas transfer from one isolated person to another and eventually come to real-world prominence through violence.“You see them taking these completely online-native words and expressions and bringing them into the real world with shootings,” she added.Two years after the Buffalo shooting, shell casings would be back in the headlines following the December killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The suspected shooter, Luigi Mangione, allegedly wrote the words “deny”, “depose” and “defend” in permanent marker on the shell casings found after the fatal shooting.And while these incidents – from Christchurch to the most recent shooting at the Texas Ice facility – are united by the use of writing on shell casings and firearms, the specifics of the writings point to distinctions in the motivations of these shooters and alleged gunmen, or to no motivation at all.In the case of Mangione and Robinson, the inscription points to targeted violence directed at one person or organization, while those found after the Christchurch, Tops and Annunciation shootings are more in-line with neo-Nazi, nihilistic, edgelord internet culture, Lewis adds.Despite the variants in purpose, location and target, these shooters and the specific use of markings on their weapons and ammunition point to “a new trend that is a part of a broader package” of shooters trying to ensure their final messages will be thoroughly disseminated through the news and statements by public officials, the experts said.“It is something else that the perpetrator wants to be seen along with a manifesto or livestream. And the most recent shootings let people know that they can ask the FBI director to tweet a picture of everything they say”, said Lewis.Experts warn it’s now important for investigators and policy makers to familiarize themselves with the history and internet culture behind these inscriptions. Many Americans continue to have little knowledge of the dark corners of online forums like 4chan and Telegram. For the victims of these shootings that involve inscribed casings, firearms and magazines, the insider meme language can add to the confusion and pain of victims and their families, Elmore-Garcia adds.“It can be distressing and disturbing. You are looking at the loss of human life and for a victim, it can feel even more nonsensical for them to see these bizarre words and phrases used in the context of a killing of their loved one.”Explore more on these topicsGun crimeGuns and liesMinneapolis school shootingCharlie Kirk shootingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Making this building wind and watertight for the first time is transformational for us.”The public reopening on Friday coincides with the museum’s 50th anniversary celebrations this weekend, a “monumental milestone” for what was the first national museum to open outside London, said its director, Craig Bentley.The idea in the Station Hall is to celebrate the station and the universal stories it can shine light on.View image in fullscreenOne of the many displays in the newly refurbished Station Hall.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“We want to appreciate and celebrate the station,” said curator Karen Baker. “We’ve all got experiences of the station, the excitement when you go on holiday, the boredom of having to wait after your train has been cancelled.“What we hope for is for people to appreciate the station in all its guises – the good, the bad … whatever.

Below is afabulous silver coffee pot in the shape of an early locomotive, which in the 19th century had pride of place in Swindon station’s refreshment rooms.Isambard Kingdom Brunel, however, described the coffee it served as tasting like “bad roasted corn”.Elsewhere in the hall is an enormous wreath that was on the front of the locomotive that hauled Victoria’s funeral train in 1901. It has been in storage for more than 30 years and the challenging restoration involved opening a case that had been sealed for more than 100 years, curators said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He started out as a teaboy ​a​t Radio Trent in 1975 and worked his way up to the very top, covering five World Cups and five European Championships forITV.​For a certain generation he will always be remembered for Wednesday night Champions League games on ITV in the 1990s. Like the best players, he rose to the occasion​.​ During the biggest match of his career he ​gave us ​two iconic lines – “name on the trophy” and “they always score” –​ in the space of two minutes. Simple, to the point and bang on the money.Tyldesley’s career has moved in tandem with the fortunes of England’s greatest ​football clubs. He was in Nottingham in the 1970s when Brian Cough was holding court at Forest; he joined Radio City in Liverpool as the two Merseyside clubs started racking up titles; and he moved to Granada in 1989 just as Alex Ferguson was finding his feet at Manchester United.His experience goes way beyond the confines of English football. Tyldesley has covered rugby league and cricket; he has lent his voice to PlayStation games and Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeway; and he even presented a podcast with his old mate Martin O’Neill – who was playing for Forest 50 years ago.Think of a big occasion in football over the last half-century and he was probably there.

Chile, another group member, has withdrawn its ambassador to Israel.Vieira said: “International law requires a state not only to refrain from genocide but also to prevent it. Failure to do so may give rise to state responsibility including complicity with genocide. The time has come for states to fulfil their obligations under the genocide convention, by adopting effective measures to ensure that they do not, directly or indirectly, collaborate with its perpetrators.”Brazil has called for an international mission on the model of the UN special committee against apartheid, a body established in 1962 to coordinate action to end South Africa’s apartheid government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cuban officials cited the reason for her death as old age and health conditions. Shakur, a longstanding symbol of resistance and Black liberation, spent several decades exiled in Cuba after she was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper in 1977 and escaped from prison.“At approximately 1:15pm on September 25th, my mother, Assata Shakur, took her last earthly breath,” her daughter Kakuya Shakur wrote onFacebook. “Words cannot describe the depth of loss that I’m feeling at this time.”BornJoAnne Deborah Byronon 16 July 1947, in Queens, New York, she was later raised in Wilmington, North Carolina during a time of racial segregation. She dropped out of high school and moved back to New York to work a low-wage job. Her life changed in 1964 when a conversation with African students about communism and Vietnam challenged her views. “We’re taught at such an early age to be against communists, yet most of us don’t have the faintest idea what communism is,” Shakur wrote in her 1987 memoir,Assata: An Autobiography. “Only a fool lets somebody else tell him who his enemy is.”In the 1960s, sheattendedBorough of Manhattan Community College and then the City College of New York and became involved with Black activist group Golden Drums society, where she advocated for Black studies courses. She married fellow student activist Louis Chesimard in 1967 and divorced in 1970, the same year that she joined the Black Panther Party.“One of the most important things the Party did was to make it really clear who the enemy was,” Shakur wrote in her memoir, “not the white people, but the capitalistic, imperialistic oppressors.”In 1971, she changed her name to Assata Olugbala Shakur to better reflect her identity as an African woman – Assata meaning “she who struggles,” in Swahili, Olugbala meaning “love for the people,” in Yoruba, and Shakur meaning “the thankful,” in Arabic.Shakur quit the Black Panther Party not long after she joined, citing her dissatisfaction with their lack of knowledge of Black history and the discouragement of criticism toward the party. She later joined the Black Liberation Army (BLA), a Marxist-Leninist Black nationalist group that fought for Black freedom through an armed front. From 1971 to 1973, she was charged with multiple crimes along with other members, including bank robberies, and the murder of a drug dealer, all of which were acquitted or dismissed.On 2 May 1973, a state trooper, James Harper, pulled over a car she was in for a failed rear light, with another trooper, Werner Foerster, in a second patrol car. Following a gunfire exchange, the Black Liberation Army member Zayd Malik Shakur and Foerster died. Shakur was convicted of murdering Foerster in 1977 and sentenced to life in prison. Two years later, BLA members disguised as visitors helped her break out ofClinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey. She later appeared in Cuba, where Fidel Castro’s government granted her asylum.In 2013, Shakur was the first woman to land on the FBI’smost-wanted terroristslist. While opponents vilified Shakur, her life and memoir inspired racial justice movements for decades.Explore more on these topicsUS newsCubaNew YorkAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Mail and parcels will not be processed or delivered for the duration of the strike and no new items will be accepted.“Canada Post’s operations will shut down during a national strike, affecting millions of Canadians and businesses across the country,” the mail service said.Joël Lightbound, the public works minister, said Canada Post has become “effectively insolvent”, even after lending the postal service C$1bn, adding that repeated financial bailouts were not a long-term solution for an organization that has lost more than $4bn since 2018. In its most recent quarter, Canada Post recorded its highest-ever quarterly loss of $407m.“It provides an essential service to Canadians, and in particular to rural, remote and Indigenous communities, and Canadians are rightfully attached to it and want it saved,” said Lightbound, adding that the postal service “is now facing an existential crisis”.In an attempt to blunt the losses, the Canadian government, Canada Post’s only shareholder, ordered an end to end door-to-door delivery of mail and to shutter a number of post officers. The crown corporation has been given 45 days to implement a restructuring plan.The union said it was “outraged and appalled” by the minister’s comments.“Throughout this time, Canada Post has done everything in its power to avoid real bargaining and has repeatedly relied on government intervention. Today is just another example.”Protracted negotiations between the union and the postal service have gone on for more than 20 months, with no clear deal in sight.The postal service has struggled against the rise of courier services, which operate more frequently and at lower cost. Letter delivery, which peaked in 2006, has also slowed dramatically.At issue is also an attempt to bring down labour costs and to shift delivery routes as the service moves away from the traditional fixed routes currently used by the service. Both have met opposition from the union, which worries the changes will reduce its full-time work force and rely more on temporary or part time workers.Business groups warned a “massive” hit to small firms’ operations was coming ahead of the holiday season. The strike last November cost small business C$1 billion in lost sales.Federal jobs minister Patty Hajdu, who faced criticism for the her rolein abruptly ending a recent strike by Air Canada flight attendants, said federal mediators available to support the bargaining process. “I encourage both parties to continue working toward a fair resolution.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Two of the detainees had allegedly been hired by the criminal group to clean up in the aftermath of the killings.News of the horrific crime prompted relatives of the women and girl and feminist and human rights groups toorganize protestsacross the country, demanding justice.“They took her away from me and I want them to pay for what they did,” the mother of Brenda del Castillo told reporters. “I want everybody to pay.”The crime has shocked a country that is not used to the level of narco violence more common in other Latin American countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Ecuador.“When narcos use this level of cruelty – not attacking each other or the police but targeting vulnerable victims – it means that something is changing and that criminal leaders are trying to show off their power, which is very worrying,“ said Germán de los Santos, an investigative journalist who covers organized crime.Activists and church workers in Buenos Aires’s poor neighbourhoods have been warning of the expansion of crime organizations in vulnerable areas across the Argentinian capital.They say these groups take advantage of rising poverty as well as cuts in public services under the far-right president, Javier Milei, to recruit young people who are struggling to make ends meet.“We are seeing thatlarge areas have been left at the mercy of small- and large-scale drug mafias, which infiltrated and ended up dominating the lives and consciousness of our people, especially children and young people, instilling a true culture of delinquency and criminality,” the Catholic diocese of San Justo, where the victims lived,said in a press release.It said that “when the state becomes absent” it allows a “culture of destruction and death to grow and advance unchecked”.Activists at a soup kitchen not far from where the women and girl were killed said they had noticed an expansion of drug-trafficking groups in the area.They said that because of cuts to public funding, they have been struggling to provide young local people with a safe space away from local drug gangs.“Without any resources, it’s very difficult to compete with what the narcos are offering,” said one activist, who asked for anonymity over concerns for their safety.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaDrugs tradeLivestreamingAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

This is the moment to lock in stronger national commitments, and the finance to deliver them, especially for adaptation [to the effects of the climate crisis]. The world is watching – and history will remember who showed up.”Other prominent figures have also privately urged Starmer – whoattended last year’s Cop29 in Azerbaijan, and as leader of the oppositionspent longer at Cop28 in Dubai in 2023than then prime minister Rishi Sunak – to attend the summit in Brazil, where countries will unveil their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade.Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and twice a UN climate envoy, said: “Cop30 in Belém this year promises to be one of the most significant climate summits in recent years. It is vital that heads of state and government attend in person to signify their commitment to climate action. Leadership must come from the top.”The UK is widely regarded as having a strong story to tell on global climate leadership, having submitted a national plan on greenhouse gas emissions cuts judged to be stronger than most other countries’ efforts.Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser to the government, said: “The attendance of world leaders on the first day of Cop30 is vital to set the trend of the meeting. A very good example is the commitment of the UK to reduce emissions by 81% by 2035, made by Starmer at the last Cop. This needs to be reiterated by the prime minister inBrazil, to persuade other countries to make similar major commitments.”A final decision has not yet been taken on the prime minister’s attendance at Cop30, which will begin with a leaders’ summit in Belem, on the mouth of the Amazon, led by Brazil’s president, Lula da Silva.Opinion polls also show strong backing across the UK for climate action, with about two thirds of people surveyed in favour. Butaccording to a report in the Financial Times, some of Starmer’s aides are fearful that Reform,whose leaders deny climate scienceandwant to scrap the net zero target, will attack the prime minister for attending.It is also not known whether King Charles will attend. Sunak attracted fierce criticism for preventing Charles from attendingCop28, against his wishes, but it would be difficult in protocol terms for the monarch to attend if the prime minister fails to.Donald Trump, the US president, will snub the summit, having dismissed the climate crisis as a “con job” in a rambling speech to the UN earlier this week.Leaders from the EU, the G7 andG20groups, and heads of state and government from scores of vulnerable countries are expected to attend the meeting, where an estimated 50,000 people will gather, and whose decisions will determine whether the world limits temperatures to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.Many of Starmer’s own MPs are concerned the prime minister would consider not going. Polly Billington, who fought off Reform to win East Thanet forLabour, and who attended Cops when she was an adviser to Ed Miliband under Gordon Brown’s premiership, said: “As someone who has been to Cops several times, I know the difference that leaders make when they attend. It focuses the minds of the negotiators on getting the best possible deal – and that is required, when we see the fragility of the consensus on acting on climate change. It is more important than ever that world leaders who understand the disastrous economic impacts of the climate crisis, and the economic opportunities of tackling it, should be there, for the world to come together.”Alex Sobel, a Labour MP who also attended Cops as a shadow minister, said: “World leaders should attend Cop30. Brazil had the highest deforestation rate under its last president, and the return of Lula shows that political leadership can make a difference, with Amazon deforestation reaching a nine-year low. After two Cops in fossil fuel producing countries, we need to show support for the UN process, and what can be achieved with the right political leadership.”Zack Polanski, the leader of the Green party, said not to go would show Starmer’s lack of commitment to tackling the climate crisis.“This would be a huge abdication of responsibility,” he said. “If you accept there is a climate emergency, you need to act as such. And the first thing you need to do is build an international consensus on the response. The very least the prime minister could and should do is turn up. Instead, Starmer’s missing in action at this time of crisis and frankly that speaks volumes.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Widespread flooding and landslides are possible and as a result schools have been shut and flights cancelled in the region. This storm will come just days after Ragasa moved to the north of the country, resulting in the death of nine people in the archipelago.On the other side of the world, the Atlantic hurricane season has finally become more active with tropical storm Humberto, now situated to the north-east of the Caribbean, named on Thursday, while Gabrielle remains a hurricane with mean wind speeds of 85mph.Humberto is expected to rapidly strengthen as it gradually moves north-eastwards, and will probably become a hurricane this weekend over the tropical south-east Atlantic.Meanwhile, Gabrielle moved over the Azores on Thursday night, bringing hurricane conditions to the islands with heavy rain, strong winds and a dangerous storm surge likely as a result.A third system, just to the north of the Dominican Republic, is also expected to develop in the coming days.Explore more on these topicsExtreme weatherWeather trackerTaiwan (World news)Hong Kong (Weather)Taiwan (Weather)Hong Kong (World news)Vietnam (Weather)Vietnam (World news)analysisShareReuse this content"

That argument just got harder to makeRead moreLast Friday, a day after the government announced it had accepted that target range, the environment minister, Murray Watt, told ABC radio in Tasmania – where logging of old growth forest continues – “it’s not the government’s intention to stop old growth logging altogether”.The Greens forests spokesperson, the Tasmanian senator Nick McKim, said the authority’s advice was clear that “even Labor’s bottom-of-the-range target of 62%” could not be met unless old growth logging, at a minimum, ceased.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter“Labor needs to announce a date to end old growth logging, and if they’re not going to do that they need to explain where they are going to find the emissions reduction to make up the shortfall,” McKim said.Some states, such as NSW, already have restrictions on logging identified and mapped old growth forest, which is forest that has either not been logged or cleared previously or where evidence of past disturbance is negligible. But logging of other high conservation value native forest continues.The Greens position is that all native forest logging should end and it has called on the government to use forthcoming reforms to Australia’s environment laws to ban the practice.McKim said ending native logging and reining in land-clearing would be one of the cheapest, fastest and most effective ways the government could cut emissions and protect biodiversity.“You could end native forest logging literally in months and it would have a massive emissions benefit,” he said.“It would actually save taxpayers money because it’s a heavily subsidised industry and what you’ve got to do is just transition communities.”McKim pointed to some states where this was already happening, such as NSW, where the Minns government has announceda major economic transition packagefor workers and communities affected by a moratorium on logging within its planned great koala national park.In a letter to the CCA’s chair, Matt Kean, this week, Lindenmayer wrote “the key issue here is the end [of] all native forest logging”. He wrote that scientific analysis showed “properly protecting native forests in Australia would make a highly significant contribution to the nation meeting its GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reduction targets”.In Tasmania alone, Lindenmayer wrote that native forest logging caused the equivalent of 1.1m cars worth of emissions every year.“It’s blindingly obvious that we have to stop native forest logging altogether and it’s one of the most powerful short-term emissions reduction steps we can take,” he told Guardian Australia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What they then did is in their report to me, quite rightly, is ran through some of the possibilities as to what achieving that might look like,” Bowen said.In response to Lindenmayer’s concerns, the government spokesperson said the agriculture and land sector plan, one of six sector plans on Australia’s transition to net zero by 2050, “outlines support for a diverse landscape – balancing competing demands between carbon storage, nature repair and agriculture”.A spokesperson for the Climate Change Authority said its analysis found “one way to achieve the 62% to 70% target involves ceasing clearing of old growth forests, halving re-clearing rates, and reducing native forest harvesting”.“This is part of the Authority’s illustrative pathway for achieving the 62-70% target. There are other ways to achieve the same target, provided the equivalent level of abatement is made up across the economy,” it said.Explore more on these topicsLabor partyClimate crisisLogging and land-clearingAnthony AlbaneseAustralian politicsTrees and forestsEmissions tradingnewsShareReuse this content"

He said: “If you are using air, and air missiles from your air fighter to shoot the drone, then you are using … [a] missile which costs 1m to kill the drone which costs 10,000.”Meanwhile, the Kremlin criticised the suggestion of shooting down Russian military planes over Europe as “reckless” and “irresponsible” after Donald Trumpsuggested alliance members should do so.0:51The moment a Russian missile strikes Dnipro in eastern Ukraine – videoAs defence talks were ongoing, a leaked proposal revealed growing momentum behind plans for a €140bn loan to Ukraine based on Russia’s frozen assets inEurope.TheEuropean Commissionbelieves it can generate a €140bn interest-free EU loan for Ukraine based on Russia’s immobilised central bank assets without confiscating the funds, according to a leaked document seen by the Guardian.While the EU alreadytakes the profits from Russian assetsfrozen in the EU to generate funds for Ukraine, the original capital remains untouched. Germany, France and Belgium have resisted plans from central and eastern European countries to seize the assets, which are largely held at theBrussels-based financial institution Euroclear.EU officials now believe they have found a legally safe way to loan Ukraine money based on the assets, predicated on the assumption thatRussiawill ultimately pay Kyiv reparations for the colossal damage inflicted during more than 1,300 days of full-scale war.In a significant move, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has swung behind such an idea, announcing via anop ed in the Financial Timeshis support for a legally secure financial instrument to secure Ukraine’s military resilience for several years.Merz said ideally the plans would be backed unanimously by the EU’s 27 member states but he suggested they could be approved by a majority, in an unspoken acknowledgment that the EU needed to consider ways to avoid a veto from Hungary’s Kremlin-friendly government.TheEU’s sanctions against Russiamust be renewed every six months, giving Budapest significant leverage, although Hungary has never blocked sanctions.EU officials also believe they have found a legal fix to avoid the unanimity requirement, meaning the cost of the loan would be ultimately paid by Russia rather than member states, which would act as guarantors.EU leaders are expected to discuss the drone wall and reparations loan at a Copenhagen summit next week with the aim of agreements by the end of October.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionDrones (military)RussiaUkraineEuropean CommissionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, who heads the party, expressed his “full support and friendship”, adding he had no doubt Sarkozy would devote all his energy to defending himself on appeal.1:46'I am innocent': Nicolas Sarkozy given five-year prison sentence after Libya trial – videoSarkozy, 70, has an appointment with the state prosecutor on 13 October when he will be told the date of his incarceration, which could be as early as October or November. French media speculated that he would probably be imprisoned in La Santé prison in the south of Paris in an individual cell but mixing with other prisoners in the courtyard and common areas. A prison officer said typically prisoners at the facility were in their cells 23 hours a day.Like any other prisoner, once Sarkozy enters jail, his lawyers will be able to petition for his release or for him to serve his term in a different way, such as with an electronic bracelet. That request would have to be heard by a judge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Judges on Thursday instead sentenced Sarkozy to five years, but with a special provision that the jail term would start in the coming weeks, despite any appeals process.On the left, Eva Joly, a former magistrate and green candidate for the presidency in 2012, said Sarkozy’s criticisms of the justice system outside the courtroom were “an attack on democracy” and a discourse of the kind made by the US president, Donald Trump.Explore more on these topicsNicolas SarkozyFranceEuropeMuammar GaddafiLibyanewsShareReuse this content"

AcrossEurope, physical identity cards have existed for decades, and digital versions have either already been successfully launched or are being trialled.In all bar two of the EU’s 27 member states, physicalID cards, in a standard, machine-readable EU format introduced in 2021, are used both as identity documents in citizens’ home countries, and for travel within the passport-free Schengen zone.In 15 countries they are compulsory: you must have one, although you are not necessarily obliged to have it with you. In another 11, they are voluntary: other forms of photo ID, such as driving licences, are accepted as identification.The size of a credit card, they display the holder’s name, address, nationality, date and place of birth, sex and height, as well as a photo and the card’s issue and expiry dates. A secure chip also stores data including the photo and fingerprints.The two exceptions are Denmark, which issues physical ID cards locally, and Ireland – but along with all other EU member states, both those countries have already either launched, or are developing, a form of digital ID wallet, and Ireland has already issued passport cards.Keir Starmer says digital ID cards an ‘enormous opportunity’ for the UKRead moreThe EU’s eIDAS 2.0 regulation will require every citizen of the bloc to be offered at least one digital ID wallet, allowing them to prove who they are and to safely store, share and sign important digital documents – such as their digital ID, birth certificate, passport, student card, qualifications, driver’s licence and tax details – by 2026.Some countries have gone further, faster. In Denmark, life online is almost impossible without MitID, a digital identity app for smartphones or tablets introduced in 2023 as a public-private partnership between banks, insurers and the digitisation ministry.You need it log into banking websites, sign up for the main payment system, shop online, access the government information and services portal, deal with your taxes, make a health appointment or view your pension online and apply for a college course.Estonians, likewise, use their almost 20-year-old e-ID (also available, if much less commonly, in card form), to vote, digitally sign documents and access public services from healthcare to education, as well as for banking and online shopping.Countries with well-developed digital identities – including war-torn Ukraine, where theDiia appallows people to store 14 important digital documentsand access 21 services – argue that they modernise and streamline public services. Estonia claims e-ID saves citizens about five days a year of pre-digital administrative hassle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They can report lost documents and verify someone else’s ID by scanning a QR code in the app.A recently added tool also allows drivers to notify insurers of a collision, confirming their ID and submitting evidence, and this month student IDs for high school pupils were added so they can use the app to get discounts on public transport and museums.The app also guides users on how to take a photo for their documents, without having to go to a professional photographer or booth.

Israeli media quoted military officers saying soldiers had been ordered on Thursday night to place loudspeakers inside Gaza and on the border.0:51Dozens walk out during Benjamin Netanyahu's United Nations speech – videoThe Times of Israel newspaperquoted a military spokespersonsaying the broadcast campaign aimed to help return the 50 hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas since it launched its surprise raid into Israel in October 2023. About 1,200, mostly civilians, died in that attack, which triggered the war, and 250 were abducted. More than half of those hostages still in Gaza are thought to be dead.In his speech, Netanyahu criticised western countries for recognising Palestine as a state and pledged to continue Israel’s offensive, which has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, injured 160,000 and reduced much of Gaza to ruins.Civilian injuries in Gaza similar to those of soldiers in war zones, study findsRead more“We’re not done yet. The final remnants of Hamas are holed up in Gaza City. They want to repeat the atrocities of October 7th again and again,” he said.Gaza’s civil defence agency – a rescue force operating under Hamas authority – reported at least 22 people killed since dawn across the territory, including 11 in Gaza City.Images from the al-Shati refugee camp north of Gaza City showed heavy damage to buildings after an airstrike with facades blown off by blasts, while people including a barefooted young girl searched through rubble for belongings. Toppled poles created a web of powerless electric wires on the ground.Much of Gaza has been reduced to ruin and UN-backed experts have declared famine in some parts. Hundreds of thousands of civilians remain in Gaza City out of an estimated population of about 1 million before Israel’s most recent offensive.A senior officer quoted byHaaretz newspaperdescribed the loudspeaker operation as “a crazy idea” without military benefit.Reporters from the Associated Press inside Gaza said they saw no immediate evidence of Netanyahu’s speech being broadcast on phones there.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesGazaMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Nope, I will not allow it. It’s not going to happen,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, adding “There’s been enough. It’s time to stop now.”Trump made the comments asBenjamin Netanyahu was arriving in New Yorkto deliver an address to the United Nations on Friday.There has been widespread speculation in Israel and elsewhere over how Netanyahu intends to retaliate for therecognition of Palestine as a stateearlier this week by the UK, Australia, France, Canada and Portugal.Map shows area of Israeli and Palestinian territories, focusing on the occupied West Bank and East and West Jerusalem.Officials in Jerusalem have said that anything Netanyahu does will be cleared first with Trump. Options include full annexation of the West Bank, or of smaller portions such as a strip of territory along the border with Jordan or shuttering British, French and other consulates in East Jerusalem, analysts said.Earlier this week, British officials said theyfeared Trump would recognise Israeli controlover illegal settlements on theWest Bank in retaliationfor the moves by the UK and others.1:05Trump says he will 'not allow' Israel to annex the West Bank – videoArab and European leaders were engaged in an intensive lobbying operation to make sure he did not go through with the recognition ofWest Banksettlements.Netanyahu has faced significant pressure from far-right factions who are part of his ruling coalition to annex the West Bank, prompting alarm among Arab leaders, some of whom met on Tuesday with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.Arab and Muslim countries warned Trump about thegrave consequences of any annexation of the West Bank– a message the US president “understands very well,” according to Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud.Washington backing plan for Tony Blair to head transitional Gaza authorityRead moreIsraeli settlements have grown in size and number since Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war and then imposed a military occupation. They stretch deep into the territory with a system of roads and other infrastructure under Israeli control, further slicing up the land. A widely condemned Israeli settlementplan known as the E1 project, which would effectively bisect the occupied West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem, received final approval in August. It will cut across land that the Palestinians seek for a state.Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, an ultra-nationalist, said at the time that a Palestinian state was “being erased from the table.”About 700,000 Israeli settlers live among 2.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law. Israel disputes this, citing historical and biblical ties to the area and saying the settlements provide strategic depth and security.While international leaders gather at the United Nations in New York, the US presented a 21-pointMiddle East peace planin a bid to end the nearly two-year-long war in Gaza.Trump, who remains Israel’s staunchest ally on the world stage, said that he spoke with representatives from Middle Eastern nations and Netanyahu on Thursday and that a deal on Gaza could happen soon.“We want the hostages back, we want the bodies back and we want to have peace in that region. So we had some very good talks,” he said.Israel has drawn global condemnation over its war in Gaza, which was triggered by a Hamas raid into Israel in 2023 in which militants killed 1,200, mostly civilians. The conflict has caused major destruction and killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, also mostly civilians.

The distribution and nature [of injuries] is almost the same or worse,” said Bilal Irfan, a bioethicist who conducts research at the University of Michigan and is one of the study’s authors.Thepeer-reviewed research, the first of its kind, drew on data provided between August 2024 and February 2025 by dozens of international medical professionals who have worked in Gaza during the nearly two-year-old conflict.Irfan said the data did not include most fatal injuries. “This is data for the patients who made it to hospital and so survived. We don’t even have a full profile of the serious injuries of those who died without any medical attention,” he said.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian man rushes a wounded girl to al-Awda hospital in the central Gaza Strip on 24 September.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/GettyThe war was triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attacks onIsraelin which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, of whom about 50 remain in Gaza, about 20 of them thought to be alive.The ensuing Israeli military campaign has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000, and has reduced swathes of the territory to ruins and displaced most of the population, in many cases multiple times.Microsoft blocks Israel’s use of its technology in mass surveillance of PalestiniansRead moreThe new study will increase the pressure on Israel, which is facing deepening isolation over its conduct of the war in Gaza. Overall, almost 24,000 trauma-related injuries were reported in the study, of which 18% were burns. About two-thirds of injuries were from explosions.Burns were particularly common and severe, in particular among children, the authors found. More than one-tenth of burn injuries were fourth-degree, meaning they penetrated all tissue layers down to the bone.The extent of traumatic injury victims reflects “the impact of indiscriminate aerial and heavy explosive bombardment in civilian areas”, the study said.Firearm injuries made up about 30% of war-related trauma, similar to reports from Syria’s civil war wherecivilianswere frequently victims during a decade of violence. Just under 10% of gunshot patients were shot in the head.The 78 experts who provided data came from 22 NGOs from Britain, the US, Canada and the EU, and included specialists in several disciplines. They were interviewed or provided data within three months of deployment in Gaza, Irfan said. The injury patterns in Gaza were then compared with studies of US combat veterans who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq.Dr Victoria Rose, a consultant plastic surgeon working at St Thomas’ hospital and King’s College hospital in London and another of the journal article’s authors, said the findings “should ring alarm bells through the halls of government worldwide and the humanitarian community”.View image in fullscreenA wounded man is treated by Nada Abu al-Rub, right, volunteering at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, on 22 September.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyIsraeli military officials insist they act within international law but admit there is “a tension” between protecting civilians and the “demands of fast-moving military operations”.They said: “We are fighting a very different war from any previous conflict anyone has fought anywhere in the world … There are strict rules of engagement but what has changed is the policy that was designed for small wars where we wanted to deter [enemies] … We are now fighting in Gaza to ensure that Hamas is not ruling Gaza.”Abbas decries Israel’s ‘genocide’ and says Hamas will have no role in future Gaza governmentRead moreData collected by the independent violence-tracking organisation Acled suggests that as many as15 of every 16 Palestiniansthe Israeli military has killed since its renewed offensive in Gaza began in March may have been civilians. Last monththe Guardian revealedthat internal data from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) indicated a civilian death toll of 83% between the outbreak of war in October 2023 and May of this year.Israel has imposed tight restrictions on supplies entering Gaza throughout the war. Last month, UN-backed food security experts confirmed famine in Gaza City and surrounding areas.The medics who contributed to the new study found that malnutrition had worsened patient outcomes, “delayed wound healing and preventable deaths from otherwise treatable conditions”.The few remaining hospitals and clinics in central and southern Gaza are now being overwhelmed by a“tsunami” of injured and sick patientsfleeing a new Israeli offensive in the north of the devastated territory, medics say.Donald Trump said on Thursday he thought a deal to end the war in Gaza was close. “I have to meet with Israel,” he said at the White House. “I think we can get that one done. I hope we can get it done.

He was arrested on Friday afternoon, on his way to address a press conference.His detention came after demonstrations in the regional capital of Leh turned violent on Wednesday. The local offices of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were among the buildings set on fire. The police responded with live ammunition, killing at least four protesters who were demanding autonomy and statehood for Ladakh.Ladakh – which sits high up in the Himalayan mountains along the fractious borders with China and Pakistan – has been under the control of the central government since 2019.The territory was part of the state of Jammu andKashmirbefore it was unilaterally dissolved by the Modi government and brought fully under its control, to the anger and frustration of the local population.The central home ministry accused Wangchuk, who had been staging a 15-day hunger strike, of inciting the “mob violence” through “provocative statements”, which referred to the Arab Spring and recentanti-corruption protests in Nepal.Wangchuk had rejected the allegation, saying he did not support violence. He claimed that the central government was building a case against him to “throw me in jail for two years”.“I am ready for that,” he said the night before his arrest. “But Sonam Wangchuk in jail may cause them more problems than a free Sonam Wangchuk.”Wangchuk rose to prominence in his fight for the educational rights and environmental preservation of Ladakh.Ice stupas of the Ladakh desert: an ingenious solution to water scarcity – a picture essayRead moreHe established an award-winning school as part of his students’ educational and cultural movement of Ladakh and is the inventor of theice stupa, an artificial glacier that helps with crucial water storage that has been adopted globally. He was also the inspiration for one of Bollywood’s most beloved films, Three Idiots.But after the Modi government took away the statehood of Jammu andKashmirand, as deadly border skirmishes with China resulted in a massive military buildup and infrastructure push in Ladakh, with a heavy environmental impact, Wangchuk began to lead a movement fighting for Ladakh’s regional autonomy.He has held repeated protests and hunger strikes, and last year led a group of hundreds of protesters on a 500-mile march from Leh to New Delhi to urge the government to heed to their demands for statehood.Wangchuk claimed he had been harassed for standing up to the BJP government, which over its decade in power has routinely arrested activists, environmentalists and those who have taken part in government action, often charging them under stringent laws.This week, the home ministry cancelled the registration that allowed Wangchuk’s NGO to receive foreign funds and put the Ladakh school he founded under criminal investigation. The move mirrors actions against organisations such as Amnesty International and Greenpeace after they were critical of the Modi government.Explore more on these topicsIndiaNarendra ModiSouth and central AsiaKashmirProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

There is an enemy. There is a project which is detrimental to our country. It actually goes against the grain of our history. It’s right there in plain sight in front of us. We have to win this battle.”While Starmer’s focus will be on setting out his own vision for renewing the country, he will also urge Labour not to be distracted by speculation over his grip on power.Burnham – who would need a Westminster seat – is seen by a number of Labour MPs as someone who could provide a more robust challenge to Reform, as well as a change in economic strategy.With Starmer’s premiership under scrutiny, Burnhamsaid this week he had been privately encouragedto challenge the prime minister.But Starmer said he was determined to reclaim patriotism from Reform and renew the country.He also insisted he would remain in office and lead Labour into the next election. “Yes, and it will be an election about this very argument,” he said.“I will also be saying to the party, this is no time for introspection. You know what conference is like, thousands of people, there’s great energy, and there’s always the usual jostling for who’s up, who’s down, all the rest of it. This is much bigger than that. This goes to the heart of who we are as a country.“We do not have time for introspection. We have to unite and fight ... we cannot miss this opportunity to set out our stall and take the fight to Reform.”Starmer said he would “confront Reform, not ape Reform”, after concerns inside his party that Downing Street was pitching to the right on issues including immigration to challenge Nigel Farage.He singled out the Reform leader’sattack on the scientific establishmentthis week, during which Farage said he would never “side with” medical experts, as an example of why the government had to defend key institutions.“Yes, we do have to, and it’s really important, because once we lose the anchor of thinking that truth matters we are on a very, very slippery slope. What Nigel Farage has said about science recently needs to be absolutely shown to be what it is, which is lies feeding off a sense of disaffection.”He also criticised Jeremy Corbyn, his leftwing predecessor as leader who he ousted from the party, claiming the veteran MP would “not get behind the fight, because he’s into the politics of grievance on the left” as much as Farage was on the right.With the budget looming large over the party conference, and tax rises looking ever more likely, Starmer admitted it was going to take time to turn the economy around. “There are no easy decisions. But we mustn’t move away from our fiscal rules,” he said, a direct retort to those advocating more borrowing.“Three years ago this week, Liz Truss tried an experiment of moving away from fiscal rules – in her case to do tax cuts. We all know what the result of that was. The same will be true for spending and borrowing outside the fiscal rules. So we have to be really clear about that.”He did not rule out increasing taxes but said the government would “set out our case” for any changes at the budget. The Treasury is expected to receive figures from the budget watchdog next week.However, he gave his clearest indication yet that he was planning to lift the two-child benefit cap. “We’re going to bring down child poverty. That is the clear intent of this government. It’s my clear personal intent. I’m very proud that the last Labour government did so obviously, we’ve got a taskforce which will report, but we will be taking measures to bring down child poverty.”The prime minister threw his weight behind his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who has faced intense criticism from within the Labour party, as well as attacks from the Conservatives. “Of course. But next week is not about who’s up, who’s down, who’s saying this about somebody else,” Starmer said.The Electoral Commission said on Friday McSweeneywould not face another investigationinto undeclared donations to the Labour Together thinktank after it found “no evidence” of any other potential offences.At a progressive governance conference in London on Friday, Rachel Reeves also underlined the economic challenge ahead. “I’m chancellor in the world that we are in, not in the world that we may wish it to be,” she said.“In those tough times, it’s even more important that we have somebody who’s got a grip, has a plan, knows what they’re doing, and is not willing to be dragged off course by every siren call.”At the same event, Starmerconfirmed that a new digital ID cardwould be introduced by 2029 that would be mandatory for people working in the UK. Darren Jones, spearheading the policy in No 10, said it could form “the bedrock of the modern state”, an indication that it could have much wider uses in future, perhaps including the benefits system.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourReform UKLabour conferenceAndy BurnhamFar rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Begum was first elected as the MP for Poplar and Limehouse 2019, while McDonnell has held his west London seat of Hayes and Harlington since 1997. He was shadow chancellor throughout Corbyn’s time as leader.There are still a series of other former Labour MPs who are without the whip. In July, after a widespread rebellion over changes to welfare, Rachael Maskell, Neil Duncan-Jordan, Brian Leishman and Chris Hinchliff were toldthey had lost the party whip for repeatedly rebelling.The four MPs had been openly critical of several government policies. Maskell and Duncan-Jordan spearheaded opposition to the cut to the winter fuel allowance and welfare reforms. Hinchliff organised a rebellion over the government’s planning bill, voicing concerns about its effect on nature.Separately in July, Diane Abbott wassuspended for a second timeafter saying she did not regret her past remarks on racism, which had cost her the whip for a long period in the last parliament.Abbott had said that people of colour experienced racism “all their lives”, which was different from the “prejudice” experienced by Jewish people, Irish people and Travellers. She was re-suspended for telling the BBC that her comments “were factually correct, as any fair-minded person would accept”.Begum said on Friday: “It is unconscionable that other colleagues remain suspended for voting with their conscience against cuts to disability benefits, along with the longest-serving black MP Diane Abbott, while others retain the whip, like Lord Mandelson.”She added: “When I stood for re-election, I said I would continue to stand up for the people of Poplar and Limehouse, championing explicitly anti-imperialist and socialist policies, and driven by a diverse people-powered movement.“I will continue to do so in this vein no matter what.”Explore more on these topicsLabourJohn McDonnellnewsShareReuse this content"

Here we answer some of the most pressing questions.Why do the people of the UK need a digital ID?They don’t, according to most of Labour’s political opponents. But Keir Starmer, with the backing of the Tony Blair Institute, believes it is time for the UK to join the other countries, such as Estonia and India, that already have a mandatory digital ID credential.Downing Street argues it will speed up citizens’ access to government services and will help employers determine whether people have the right to work in the UK. It would deter smuggling gangs who organise small boat crossings, Labour claimed, adding that digital ID will also make it simpler to apply for services such as driving licences, childcare and welfare, while streamlining access to tax records.Why is Tony Blair involved?He tried but failed to introduce a national ID card when he was prime minister. In recent years he began lobbying for a digital version. His institute, which is heavily funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder of the US tech company Oracle, says it will “directly improve the government’s fiscal position by reducing benefit fraud, improving the efficiency of tax-revenue collection and helping to better target financial-support payments during crises”.How does the public feel about it?According topollingfrom Ipsos this month, the public is divided on the idea of a specifically digital ID, with 38% in support and 32% opposed. Support is higher at 57% when the question asked about a “national identity card”. Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, has joined leaders of the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives, the DUP, SNP and Sinn Féin in opposing the idea.“It will make no difference to illegal immigration, but it will be used to control and penalise the rest of us,” he said. “The state should never have this much power.”What data will the digital ID include and where will citizens keep it?It will include the holder’s name, date of birth, information on nationality or residency status and a photograph. Ministers are also considering whether to add an address. It will be kept as a digital file inside a wallet that can be held on a smartphone. Thisgov.uk“wallet” is being developed to hold digital driving licences. The same data will also be stored on government databases so anyone needing to verify a credential can cross-check digitally.It is not yet clear whether all the data will be gathered in one place, which experts fear could be a prime target for hackers.Will it be compulsory?In the first instance it will be mandatory as proof of a citizen’s right to work in the UK. The government has not said it will be essential for any other interactions yet. It won’t be essential to carry it.But some people fear this is the thin end of a wedge and that it will lead to digital ID being used for more and more interactions with officialdom and become increasingly ubiquitous.What happens if there is an error?This is a concern highlighted by, among others, Gianvito Lanzolla, a professor of strategy at Bayes business school in London. He said errors could “cascade” across areas like tax and healthcare, potentially locking people out of essential services.What about people who don’t have a smartphone?About 1.7m households are offline, according to the Digital Poverty Alliance. Eight per cent of people aged 16 or overdo not have a smartphone, which for the UK translates into just under 4.5 million people, but among the over-75s the proportion is said to be 28%.“The introduction of digital IDs sets a dangerous precedent, potentially only allowing people the right to work if they can afford and use a smartphone,” said the charity’s chief executive, Elizabeth Anderson. She said this could create a blackhole in the labour market and exclude a significant portion of the population.It has been reported that people without access to a smartphone could be given a physical card instead.What if a phone is lost or stolen?The digital credential can be immediately revoked and reissued.Explore more on these topicsIdentity cardsUK civil libertiesKeir StarmerSmartphonesTony BlairLabournewsShareReuse this content"

But Alan Woodward, a professor and cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey, said that if the data is also held on a vast database to allow for cross-referencing, “it’s painting a huge target on something to say ‘come and hack me’”.The government has not yet provided detail on how it would make the system work, sparking calls for greater transparency. Woodward’s warning comes amid rising public concern about criminal data breaches, which this week hit a chain of children’s nurseries with photos of infants leaked on to the dark web, and continued to cripple Jaguar Land Rover. Data, including photographs, has previously been criminally exfiltrated from a government ID system inEstonia, according to reports.Ministers said the new digital ID – which has been dubbed “Britcard” – would tackle small boat crossings by making it tougher to work illegally in the UK. But they also said it could be used for applying for welfare, driving licences, childcare and access to tax records. The plan was criticised by civil liberties campaigners and leaders of the Liberal Democrats, Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland and the SNP in Scotland.The government said the new digital ID will be held on people’s phones in thegov.ukwallet that is being developed to hold driving licences, “just as millions already use the NHS App or contactless mobile payments”. The scheme would draw inspiration from schemes in Australia, Estonia, India and Denmark, it said.Share your thoughts on plans for a UK digital ID schemeRead more“Digital ID is an enormous opportunity for the UK,” said Starmer. “It will make it tougher to work illegally in this country, making our borders more secure. And it will also offer ordinary citizens countless benefits, like being able to prove your identity to access key services swiftly – rather than hunting around for an old utility bill.”Companies including Deloitte, BAE Systems, PA Consulting and Hinduja Global Solutions already have government contracts worth a combined £100m to support the scheme’s IT systems, but industry estimates of the total cost of a national digital ID range from £1.2bn to £2bn.US tech companies have also been circling the UK government. In February, Starmer was a guest at the headquarters of Palantir, co-founded by the Trump donor Peter Thiel, which already has contracts with the NHS and the Ministry of Defence. OpenAI signed a memorandum of understanding with ministers earlier this year to explore the deployment of advanced AI models in public services. Last week Starmer was the special guest on stage at a corporate event in London for the $4tn chip-maker Nvidia.Experts in government technology said most of the data needed is already held on government databases including in birth registers, e-visa records for migrants, on passports and driving licences. Data storage companies such as Amazon and Google could provide a vast database for all the data to be gathered, but this would bring a greater security risk, Woodward said.Starmer’s announcement also sparked concerns that millions of people who lack credentials or suffer from digital poverty could be excluded from public services.“When things don’t go well it could have serious consequences, especially for those on the margins of society who could be excluded,” said Peter Chamberlain, who developed part of the scheme’s digital architecture and is the senior director of technology at consultancy Public Digital. “In order for this to succeed, transparency is absolutely crucial.”The campaign group Liberty warned that digital IDs could become “a nightmarish surveillance system”.“Technological advancements mean that digital ID systems pose an even greater risk to privacy than they did when last proposed in the 2000s,” it said. “A single and unique ‘digital identity’ and centralising databases would remove much of the individual’s agency in managing their data. This information could be used to profile individuals across multiple datasets and would pose particular risks to marginalised communities.”The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said her party would oppose any push by the government “to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens”. Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, called the idea “nonsensical” and said the party will “fight against it tooth and nail”.John Swinney, the SNP Scottish first minister, said the mandatory ID was an infringement on daily lives and said that by “calling it BritCard, the prime minister seems to be attempting to force every Scot to declare ourselves British”.In Northern Ireland, both Sinn Féin and the DUP also objected to the proposal, with Sinn Féin first minister Michelle O’Neill calling it an “attack” on the Good Friday agreement.Explore more on these topicsIdentity cardsUK civil libertiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Their website on the dark web has posted a “data leakage roadmap” that sets out how the “next steps for us will be to release 30 more profiles of each child and 100 employees’ private data”.According to a cybersecurity industry briefing seen by the Guardian, Radiant appears to be a new group within cybercrime circles that is “testing the boundaries of morality and depravation”.The group’s online posts show a proficient command of English but there are indications that they may be non-western, such as a “slight awkwardness” in phrasing, the analysis notes.It further states that the Radiant gang’s “leak site” – a common ransomware tactic in which a victim’s data is displayed on the dark web – contains 10 Kido customer profiles, which include the child’s name, date of birth, birthplace and details of parents, grandparents and guardians including addresses and phone numbers.The site also claims to have sensitive data on more than 8,000 children and their families, including accident and safeguarding reports, as well as billing. It says all Kido nurseries in the UK were affected.The leak site cites attempts to negotiate with Kido and carries a threat to “ruin their entire company as we slowly leak and we urge them to continue our dialog[ue]”.Kido has not responded to the Guardian’s request for comment. The nursery chain is working with the authorities, including the Information Commissioner’s Office and Ofsted, and the Metropolitan police is investigating.An email seen by the Guardian from Kido UK’s chief executive, Catherine Stoneman, said it was treating the incident “with the highest priority”, including engaging independent IT forensic experts in a “complex” and potentially time-consuming investigation. She attributed the breach to “two third-party systems used to process certain data”.She wrote: “Where we have confirmed that a family’s information has been affected, the family will have already been contacted. If you have not received individual correspondence from us, that means we have no forensic evidence that your data has been impacted.”Kido, which has 18 sites aroundLondon, with more in the US, India and China, told parents the breach happened when criminals accessed their data hosted by a software service called Famly, which is widely used by nurseries to share photos and information with parents.Anders Laustsen, the chief executive of Famly, said: “We have conducted a thorough investigation of the incident and can confirm that there has been no breach of Famly’s security or infrastructure in any way and no other customers have been affected. We of course take data security and privacy extremely seriously at Famly.”One woman told the BBC she had received a threatening phone call from the criminals, who said they would post her child’s information online unless she put pressure on Kido to pay a ransom.Sean, whose child is at the Kido nursery in Tooting, told the Guardian that he and all the parents he knew had not heard directly from the nursery that their child’s data had been compromised, though they remained apprehensive. “How have they got details on just certain kids and not everyone – that’s the bit that’s not making loads of sense,” he added.He viewed the cyber-attack as an inherent risk of using any app, and considered the opportunity to gain real-time information on his child, such as what they had eaten, worth it. Sean said he felt sorry for the nursery staff who were “getting the brunt of complaints”, when it was the app provider that needed to explain itself.“One of the things that’s obviously horrifying is that whoever the people are, they are sinking to new depths trying to extort money out of a nursery and holding children to ransom.” he said.The police advise companies against paying hacker ransoms as it fuels the criminal ecosystem as cyber-attacks become increasingly widespread.Notable recent victims include the Co-op, Marks & Spencer and Jaguar Land Rover, with many hacks attributed to an English-speakingcybercriminal community known as Scattered Spider.The M&S hack deployed ransomware, a tactic popular with Russian speaking cyber gangs involving software that locks up a target’s IT systems.The BBC has held conversations through the messaging app Signal, and learned that although they spoke fluent English, the criminals said it was not their first language and claimed they hired people to make the calls.The criminals said: “We do it for money, not for anything other than money. I’m aware we are criminals. This isn’t my first time and will not be my last time.”They added that they would not be targeting preschools again as the attention had been too great.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeHackingChildrenInternetLondonInternet safetyEarly years educationnewsShareReuse this content"

Roberts appears to be held at the Pottawattamie county jail, about two hours west of Des Moines, according to the Ice online detainee database. The database lists Roberts’s country of birth as Guyana.In a statement to the Guardian, DHS said that Roberts was arrested because he had “a final order of removal and no work authorization”.“During a targeted enforcement operation on Sept 26, 2025, officers approached Roberts in his vehicle after identifying himself, but he sped away. Officers later discovered his vehicle abandoned near a wooded area. State Patrol assisted in locating the subject and he was taken into ICE custody,” the agency shared in a statement. “Roberts has existing weapon possession charges from February 5, 2020. Roberts entered the United States in 1999 on a student visa and was given a final order of removal by an immigration judge in May of 2024.”The 54-year-old began his term as superintendent of Des Moines schools in July 2023, overseeing a school district that serves more than 30,000 students and nearly 5,000 employees.Jackie Norris, the Des Moines school board president, said Roberts has been an “integral part of our school community” who has “shown up in ways big and small”.Norris said a state board had granted Roberts a license to serve as superintendent in 2023 and that the district has been unable to verify Ice’s claims about his immigration status.In a joint statement, the presidents of unions representing teachers and other school employees inIowasaid that Roberts had been a “tremendous advocate for students, families, staff, and the community” and expressed shock at his arrest.“His leadership and compassion for all students, regardless of background, identity, or family origin, are a beacon of light in one of the state’s most diverse school districts,” said Joshua Brown, the Iowa State Education Association president, and Anne Cross, the Des Moines Education Association president, in a joint statement. “It is a dark and unsettling time in our country. This incident has created tremendous fear for DMPS students, families, and staff.”Matt Smith, a Des Moines schools official who was appointed Friday to serve as interim superintendent, said members of the community felt “sad, outraged and helpless” after learning of Roberts’s detention.In mediainterviewsand biographies, Roberts has said he was raised in Brooklyn, New York, by Guyanese immigrant parents. A 2023 statement from the district announcing Roberts’s appointment said he was “born to immigrant parents from Guyana, and spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn”. In 2023, he became the first person of color to be named to the position of superintendent in Iowa’s largest school district. He is a former Olympic athlete who competed as a middle-distance runner for Guyana in the 2000 Sydney games.Court records in Pennsylvania show that Roberts pleaded guilty in January 2022 to a minor infraction for unlawfully possessing a loaded firearm in a vehicle, and was fined. The case stemmed from a citation in Erie county issued the prior month by a Pennsylvania game commission officer, who stopped Roberts as he was finishing a day of deer hunting on state lands.Roberts said at the time he was a longtime licensed hunter and gun owner, and that he had left his hunting rifle on the seat of his vehicle in plain view to ensure the officer did not feel threatened during their interaction. He said that he was shocked when the officer cited him for doing so, but that he pleaded guilty to avoid any distraction. He questioned whether his dark skin may have played a role in the case.“I may not appear to be the ‘type of man’ who would enjoy deer season in Pennsylvania, in fact, I am and have been hunting for more than 20 years,” Roberts wrote in a social media post then.Earlier this year, after Donald Trump’s administration removed restrictions on Ice officers searching schools, churches and other sensitive locations, Roberts and the leaders of other regional school districts issued guidelines for parents and families enrolled in public schools.In a letter to parents, Roberts said that schools would comply with warrants from immigration officers, and that agents seeking information about students would be directed to administrators.“Everyday Des Moines Public Schools does everything we can within our legal and moral authority to support students, which is always our top priority,” he said.Phil Roeder, a spokesperson for the school district, said he was supposed to meet Roberts at a school event Friday morning, but Roberts sent a text saying he could not make it. Roeder said he got a video call from Roberts soon after and watched officials detain him.Roeder told the Associated Press that the district has seen “nothing that would suggest that he’s not a citizen”.The district said Friday afternoon that a third party had been hired to conduct a comprehensive background check on Roberts and that Roberts completed an I-9 form, which requires workers to present documents showing that they are authorized to work. District officials also stated they had no knowledge of an order of removal issued in 2024.The district also named an interim superintendent.This article was amended on 26 September 2025. An earlier version said Ian Roberts was born in Brooklyn, based on past interviews. However, a 2023 statement from the district says he was “born to immigrant parents from Guyana, and spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn”.Explore more on these topicsIowaUS educationUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Other schedules mention a lunch with Thiel in November 2017 and a potential trip by Musk to Epstein’s private island in December 2014.A manifest from 2000 for Epstein’s plane includes Prince Andrew, whose relationship with Epstein iswell documented, while a financial disclosure the Democrats released shows Epstein paying someone listed as “Andrew” for “Massage, Exercise, Yoga” that same year.Earlier this year, MuskaccusedTrump of being in the so-called “Epstein files” on social media after the tech mogulcriticizedTrump’s tax and spending legislation.Then in July, Musk publiclysaid:“How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?”Pointing to the significance of the latest records’ release, Sara Guerrero, a spokesperson for the oversight committee, said: “It should be clear to every American that Jeffrey Epstein was friends with some of the most powerful and wealthiest men in the world. Every new document produced provides new information as we work to bring justice for the survivors and victims.”Meanwhile, Eric Swalwell, a Democratic representative of California, wrote on X following the records’ release,saying:“Trump OUTS @elonmusk as being in Epstein Files. Revenge for Elon outing Trump? Elon, what do you know about Trump’s involvement?”In response to the latest release, the Republican-led committee took to X and accusedDemocratsof selectively deciding which records to publicize.“This is old news. It’s sad how Democrats are conveniently withholding documents that contain the names of Democratic officials. Once again they are putting politics over victims. That’s all Robert Garcia and Oversight Dems know how to do. We are releasing them all soon,” thestatementsaid, referring to Robert Garcia, the committee’s ranking member.Garcia, a Democrat of California, pushed back on X, writing in a separate statement: “We don’t care how wealthy or powerful you are – or if you are a Democrat or Republican. If you are in the Epstein documents and files we are going to expose it, and bring justice for the survivors. Release ALL THE FILES NOW!”The documents are the latest in the saga over the government’s handling of the Epstein case.In the House, Democrats have joined with a small group of Republicans on a petition that will force a vote on legislation to compel the release of the Epstein files. The push needs 218 signatures to succeed, which it is expected to soon get after Democrat Adelita Grijalva this weekwon a special electionto an Arizona seat that became vacant when her father died.However, any legislation that passes the House will also need approval by the Senate, whose Republican leaders have shown little interest in the issue. Trump, who has called the furor over Epstein a “Democrat hoax” would also need to sign the bill.The Guardian has requested comment from Musk and Thiel.This article was amended on 26 September 2025. The seat won by Adelita Grijalva is in Arizona, not New Mexico, as we originally said.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsJeffrey EpsteinDemocratsUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Sinclair currently owns more than 185 TV stations across 85 markets, while Nexstar owns 200 stations across 116 markets.In astatement, Sinclair said it received “thoughtful feedback from viewers, advertisers and community leaders representing a wide range of perspectives”.“Our objective throughout this process has been to ensure that programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience,” the firm said.The company said that it had “ongoing and constructive discussions” with ABC where Sinclair proposed measures to strengthen accountability and viewer feedback, including having a “network-wide independent ombudsman”. ABC and Disney have not agreed to the measures, and Sinclair noted that it “respects their right to make those decisions under network affiliate agreements”.Nexstar separately said: “We have had discussions with executives at [Disney] and appreciate their constructive approach to addressing our concerns.”Much of the Kimmel controversy started when Brendan Carr, chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),threatenedregulatory blowback to broadcasters if Kimmel’scommentson Charlie Kirk’s killing were not addressed.Nexstar is seeking FCC approval for amergerwith Tegna, another owner of local TV stations. The merger would require the FCC to change limits on the percentage of the national audience that it reaches, which essentially caps the number of TV stations a single company can own.Nexstar was the first to announce it would preempt Kimmel’s show, followed by Sinclair. Shortly after, ABC announced it would pause production of Kimmel’s show “indefinitely” – a hiatus that lasted almost a week, and prompted widespread criticism.On Truth Social,Donald Trumppraised ABC for taking Kimmel off the air, saying it had “the courage to do what had to be done”, before criticizing the company for reversing the decision.“I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do,” Trump wrote on Tuesday. “Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,” he said, referring to Disney’scontroversial payment to Trumpto settle a defamation lawsuit in December.After ABC announced Kimmel would come back Tuesday, Nexstar said in a statement that it would continue to evaluate the status of the show.“We are engaged in productive discussions with executives of the Walt Disney Company, with a focus on ensuring the program reflects and respects the diverse interests of the communities we serve,” it said.In recent days, Sinclair has stressed that its decision to continue preemptingJimmy KimmelLive! “was independent of any government interaction or influence”.“Free speech provides broadcasters with the right to exercise judgment as to the content on their local stations,” the company said, adding that it “is simply inconsistent to champion free speech while demanding broadcasters air specific content.”Sinclair has a history of being influential in boosting the conservative movement in recent years, includingrequiringlocal TV news anchors to read a script about “fake news” and “one-sided news stories plaguing our country”, elevating claims that Trump was making at the time during his first presidency.Explore more on these topicsJimmy KimmelDonald TrumpTrump administrationTelevision industryABCUS television industryUS televisionnewsShareReuse this content"

America and its military can not run without steel and computer chips. The nation’s food and drug supply must be protected. But have you considered the security implications of your kitchen sink?Announcing his latest wave of tariffs on goods from overseas – a 50% levy on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 30% on upholstered furniture, to be enforced next month – Trump once again cited the top priority of any president.On his social media platform, Trump alleged that foreign firms are “FLOODING” the US with such products, and added: “It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process.”Experts are scratching their heads.“It is difficult to see how some of the products subject to tariffs have anything to do with national security, even broadly defined,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, and a former official at the International Monetary Fund.And while the president has presented these latest tariffs as a defense of US industry, the US industry in question is not immediately celebrating news of these incoming protections.The National Kitchen and Bath Association represents US designers, builders, remodelers, manufacturers, dealers, and retailers. Bill Darcy, its global president and CEO, said the sector was “carefully reviewing the implications” of the tariffs, vowing to “continue to support and identify areas for continued success with our manufacturing partners… across the globe”.The cabinets, vanities and furniture tariffs are set to be imposed under section 232, a provision of a national security law, through which the president can order an investigation and ultimately impose tariffs – bypassing Congress, despite its constitutional authority – if certain imports are deemed to threaten national security.The Trump administration has already used section 232 to impose tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and cars. This latest announcement, focused largely on furniture, is a fresh test of just how far “national security” grounds can be stretched to enact the president’s tariff agenda.A White House official told the Guardian that an upcoming report into the findings of the section 232 investigation would explain exactly how foreign kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture pose a threat to US national security.The administration is alreadyfighting one significant legal battleover its contested use of legislation – the International Emergency Economic Powers Act – to impose tariffs. And with section 232, many of those closely following its rationale are increasingly dubious.“This justification for imposing tariffs through executive actions while sidelining the US Congress is wearing increasingly thin,” said Prasad. “All told, such peremptory actions are fomenting enormous uncertainty and volatility in the trade landscape and will ultimately hurt rather than help US consumers and businesses.”Explore more on these topicsTariffsUS economyTrump tariffsEconomicsDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

Europe had waited 21 years to lead at the end of a Ryder Cup’s opening day on American soil. In 2004, they romped to victory at Oakland Hills. There should be no sense of a similar procession forLuke Donaldand his 2025 contingent. Nonetheless, the strength of Europe’s early performance in New York felt hugely significant. It is Keegan Bradley, the US captain, who does not have his troubles to seek. Europe won two sessions out of two, including five of the first six matches.“We have only played 28% of the points,” said a bullish Bradley. “This is first quarter. We’ve still got three quarters to go. I’ve got a lot of faith in my boys.” As shadows lengthened, the final joust of the day became the most captivating.Rory McIlroyand Shane Lowry faced Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns in a fourball contest that ebbed and flowed quite wonderfully. Europe had taken the foursome element by 3-1, with two more points subsequently secured. Bradley was cheered only by Cameron Young and Justin Thomas dismissing Ludvig Åberg and Rasmus Højgaard. Could Cantlay and Burns spare some blushes?Ryder Cup 2025: Europe extend lead to 5½-2½ over USA after day-one fourballs – live updatesRead moreLowry, McIlroy and Burns had putts for threes on the last. The score could flip between 5-3 and 6-2 depending on the success or otherwise of them. Lowry left his short. Burns missed to the right. McIlroy, once again central to epic theatre, had 12ft to win the match. The Masters champion watched his attempt slide agonisingly by the left of the hole. Europe’s 5 ½ plays 2 ½ for the USA.McIlroy soon acknowledged disappointment but admitted the European team would have bitten hands off for this scenario before a ball was struck. The visitors will be strong favourites to prevail again in Saturday’s morning foursomes.“We all knew how important it was to get off to a good start,” Donald said. “To win again this afternoon was another tick in a box. I am very happy with where we are.”Scottie Scheffler endured a miserable day at the office. It concluded on the 16th green in partnership with JJ Spaun, losing to Jon Rahm and Sepp Straka. Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood were one down to Ben Griffin andBryson DeChambeauafter 10. The Englishmen rallied brilliantly to prevail on the final green. Fleetwood’s putting over the closing stretch was magnificent.McIlroy and Lowry looked safe when two up on the 12th tee. A McIlroy putt somehow stayed above ground after a 360 degree circuit of the cup at the 13th, as the Americans won back-to-back holes to square the match. Both sides had chances thereafter but a half point each was ultimately fair.Bradley is already facing criticism. And no wonder. Picking foursomes as the first session worked for the Americans at Whistling Straits but they already had so many advantages in thatRyder Cup. Here, with the teams closely matched, Bradley surely erred in starting with a format Europe excel in. Donald and his players had an opportunity to gain early momentum which they did not waste. Bradley publicly insisted at lunchtime that the arrival of Donald Trump on Air Force One would assist his team. Yes, he really was that desperate.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy shows his emotion during the foursomes win against Collin Morikawa and Harris English.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAStatistical gurus had determined that Collin Morikawa and Harris English was the worst combination the US could deploy in a foursomes contest. What did Bradley do? In the penultimate game of the morning, McIlroy and Fleetwood hammered Morikawa and English 5&4.

Europe took this one 5&3. Donald struck gold with this pairing, which was heavily influenced by Europe’s use of data analysis.Rahm, the star of day one, combined with Tyrrell Hatton in the first match of this Ryder Cup to defeat DeChambeau and Thomas, 4&3. DeChambeau cracked a drive to within a flick of the 1st green. Two shots later, the USA were one up. DeChambeau and Thomas failed to win another hole. For all DeChambeau’s noise, for all DeChambeau’s fuss, he lost two out of two on Friday. “Luck is on their side right now,” said the Californian. Saucer of milk, Bryson?Foursomes solace for the hosts came in the final match, where Xander Schauffele and Cantlay defeated Robert MacIntyre and Viktor Hovland, 2up. MacIntyre was distracted by a spectator shot during his tee shot backswing at the 17th, a crucial moment which allowed the US to edge in front.There have already been too many similar interferences from those with outside the ropes carrying big mouths and much smaller brains. Generally, though, Europe’s showing has punctured the New York mood. Donald will be aware this is already a glorious opportunity to make history.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Rory McIlroyBryson DeChambeauLuke DonaldRyder CupGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

And yet there may be hopeDetroit are making the wrong kind of baseball history after a late-season freefall threatens a once certain playoff place. But at least they’re now underdogsDavid LengelFri 26 Sep 2025 08.51 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 12.09 EDTShareOn Wednesday night against the Cleveland Guardians, Tigers first baseman Spencer Torkelson stood stunned as he watched a routine ground ball spin off his glove and into right field. Later, his teammate, catcher Dillon Dingler, doubled over in disbelief after an innocent foul pop up plopped off his mitt and on to the dirt. These were some of the low-lights of yet another Tigers loss,their eighth straight, a defeat which dropped them completely out of first place for the first time since April, shortly after the 2025 season began.Collapse is not a powerful enough descriptor to characterize Detroit’s sudden and dramatic downfall, which we’ll get to momentarily. But first, some housekeeping. With three games to go of the regular season, the Tigers and the Guardiansare tied for first place in the AL Central, but Cleveland own the tiebreaker as they have the better head-to-head over the course of the season. The Tigers dohold a one-game lead over the Houston Astrosfor the final wildcard place, but if their collapse continues and the Astros do well in their final games, Detroit would be in serious trouble. For the Tigers, who were skating towards the playoffs with a9.5-game lead in the AL Central with just 16 to play as recently as 10 September,there are three ways their regular season could end. On Monday morning, their fans could wake up dazed but with a division title, sputtering “it was all just a terrible dream.” Or Detroit could be preparing for a humiliating but somewhat face saving wildcard series. The third option, in which the Astros overtake them and the Tigers miss the postseason altogether, is that the franchise becomes the holder of what is arguably the most catastrophic late season collapse in nearly 150 years of Major League Baseball.Guardians’ David Fry suffers facial fractures after being hit by 99 mph fastballRead moreAt this point, one thing we can definitively say is that these once promising young Tigers are in dire need of a break. By that I mean for a few bounces to go their way,anda couple of days to set their heads straight. Except baseball doesn’t work that way. AsEarl Weaver, Baltimore’s Hall-of-Fame manageronce toldWashington Post writer Thomas Boswell, “This ain’t a football game, kid. We do this every day.”And it’s that baseball schedule, a 162-game slog that starts in the thaws of March and ends in the early frosts of late September, that is at least partially responsible for the history that made the1964 Philadelphia Philliesand the 2007 New York Mets the benchmarks for late season swoons. The sheer volume of baseball games in a season opens the doorfor graphics like this, which claims (ridiculously) that on that same 10 September, Detroit had a 100% chance of making the playoffs. Now they don’t know if they’re going anywhere other than Cancún. This couldn’t happen in most other sports, where, for example, a four-game divisional lead in the NBA feels like eight, and, well, a division title really doesn’t matter and sliding down a few seeds has minor consequences.In the pre-division MLB alignment up of 1964, when the Phillies blew their 6.5 game lead with 12 to play, the result was brutal: a blown National League pennant. In the wild card era of 2007, when the Mets, who are on the verge ofmaking their own piece of miserable historythis season, blew aseven-game lead with 17 to play, they wound up missing out on the playoffs entirely. If the Tigers earn a wildcard berth over the Astros, they’ll be forced to play, guess who, the Guardians in a three-game series, and all those match-ups will be played in Cleveland.And yet, with such a long season, streaks of such malaise are not unheard of, even for strong teams. The 2000 New York Yankeesfinished the season 3-14and went on to win their third World Series title in four years. So when AJ Hinch’s Tigers, a relatively young, inexperienced club, slumped to a 1-14 stretch in July, was it unnerving? Yes. But then they righted the ship and hit their high-water mark of 25 games over .500 on 23 August. Criticism of team president Scott Harris – who passed on adding a big bat to protect the farm system despite a good but not great lineup – quieted once the team turned things around. Now? Well, it’s a different story altogether, with the once celebrated Harris being universally vilified by the locals.With soon to be multi-Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal under team control for just one more year and the team on the verge of making the wrong kind of history, all of the franchise’s recent accomplishments are on the verge of being cast in the darkest shadow baseball can offer. Their unexpected playoff run in 2024? Owning the best record in baseball earlier this season? Sending six players to the All-Star Game? The reclamation of all-star Javier Baez (once considered one of the worst free agent contracts in baseball history)? yet another incredible season from Skubal? Torkelson, the former No 1 overall draft pick, who wasn’t even guaranteed a starting place in Spring Training, finally fulfilling his potential? Right now, that’s all gone.Instead, the city of Detroit is deep into the full-blown panic that takes over when a sports plague sucks up every ounce of oxygen available. Tuning into local sports talk radio for just five minutes on Thursday revealed hosts and callers arguing over whether it’s better to miss the playoffs altogether rather than suffer the embarrassment of a wildcard series. One host decried that the “anything can happen in the playoffs” mantra sounded a lot like “trying your luck as a 16th seed in an NCAA basketball tournament.” Gulp.“To be honest, people are embarrassed by it, because you take pride in your city,” saysDeadline Detroitjournalist Allan Lengel (disclaimer: yes, he’s a relation). “And so this is another national embarrassment, and we’re kind of hoping that nobody in other cities is paying attention, but, you know, I’m getting little notes from people: ‘Oh my God … what’s going on with the Tigers?’”What’s going on is that their fanbase is so low, they can’t begin to imagine the team winning another game, and that’s in a sport where you can run into a win here and there almost by accident.All that said, for a collapse of this type to unfold, it does take two to tango, and what Cleveland have pulled off is nearly as remarkable. On 4 September, the Guardians were in third place with a 69-70 record, 11 games behind Detroit – only slightly better than their 15.5 game July deficit. Then, just as the Tigers were gearing up for their sudden slide, Cleveland put together a run of 19 games where they won all but two games and outscored their opponents 86 to 32, while posting a 1.35 ERA, a truly jaw dropping set of results.That staggering run came to a close on Thursday night, withDetroit snapping their slide,moving back into a dead heat with their rust-belt rivals. But as it’s been with the September version of the Tigers, even the good news isn’t good: Cleveland own the tiebreaker, so even when Detroit is even, they’re still effectively in second place. To finish the season, Cleveland are at home to Texas, who have nothing to play for while Detroit head to Boston whose games should still matter as the AL playoff picture takes form.What’s good? Well, maybe it’s that Detroit, a city that’s had its share of both real life and sports setbacks, is back in a more familiar place – as underdogs.Explore more on these topicsDetroit TigersUS sportsMLBBaseballCleveland GuardiansHouston AstrosBoston Red SoxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Already. Did you know that? That’s what people are saying. There has never been a bigger Ryder Cup in history. Tremendous crowds. Tremendous. The biggest crowds anyone has ever seen. Maybe the biggest crowds in the history of sport, I don’t know. But that’s what they are saying. And the ratings. The whole world is watching, folks. And they can’t believe how good it is. They can’t believe it. It’s so big, so beautiful, so classy. They say to me: “Mr President, how do you do it?” Other countries wish they had a tournament like this. But they don’t. Only here. Only here.Now the crooked media is saying that it was chaos this morning, folks, total chaos, and they’re just terrible. They are saying that the transport didn’t work and that the roads were gridlocked and everyone had to walk the last mile of highway just to get to the course and that all the other roads were shut and all you beautiful people were stuck outside in the huge queues so you couldn’t even get in to see the first tee shots after you had paid all that money for tickets. Hundreds and hundreds of dollars. It’s fake news folks, let me tell you, it’s fake news, terrible, terrible, that people make this stuff up. Maybe we’ll have to do something about it.Ryder Cup 2025: USA 1-3 Europe after day-one foursomes – live updatesRead moreWell, the Guardian was there, on foot, and yes, for all those of us who weren’t travelling by Air Force One it was goddamn bedlam. “I hope it’s chaos,” said Collin Morikawa on Tuesday. He got his wish. The shuttle buses moved so slowly that it would have been quicker if they’d just let people use them as a corridor and walk off one and on to the next. After half an hour everyone gave up and got off. The problem was the route crossed the railway line in from New York City which meant that groups of people ended up sprinting around the barriers and across the tracks while the trains were bearing down on them, blowing horns to scare them out the way.One train driver actually stuck his head out the window and screamed at the people scattering either side of the tracks: “You idiots could have been killed!” Up at the course hundreds of staff who were supposed to be working inside were being routed in with the public, who were arranged in a disorderly queue that stretched further than one of Bryson DeChambeau’s drives. There were policemen bellowing and bawling and shouting and screaming, helicopters and drones buzzing overhead, a couple of fighter jets whizzed by, somewhere in among it all a powerline exploded. You only needed Robert Duvall to turn up muttering about the smell of napalm in the morning.What we got, instead, was the 47th president of the United States.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and his granddaughter Kai Madison Trump appear before the fervent crowds at Bethpage Black on Friday.Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesBy the time Air Force One flew over, you were just beginning to wonder whether Donald Trump might change his mind about coming. The US were trailing 3-1 in the morning foursomes when his plane took off, and by the time he landed Bethpage was so quiet that the European fans were singing about how it felt as if they were in a library. “I heard the team is not doing so well,” Trump said. “So when I heard that, I said, ‘Let’s get on the plane.’ We have to fly and help them. We’ll get it, we’ll get it done one way or the other, we’ll get it done.”Maybe he could give them some tips about how to do it. The man has won 36 club championships. They just need to pick up a couple of 10-foot putts without asking, then send some of the security men off down the far end of the fairway to kick their own balls out of the rough and toss the opposition’s into the sandtraps.There were enough of them for the job. You could spot them by the huge letters saying SECRET SERVICE on their chests. They had set up airport-style security around the grandstand at the first tee. No umbrellas, folding chairs, range finders, cigarette lighters or flasks were allowed in. “I’m going to let you take in that apple,” the guard said to the man next to me, “but I need to know that you know that if you throw it, you will go to jail.”Trump finally arrived at midday and took his seat behind a thick screen of bulletproof glass set up at the front of the grandstand by the first tee. US captain Keegan Bradley bowed down, JJ Spaun did the Trump dance, Scottie Scheffler pointed and snapped his fingers. When DeChambeau walked out, Trump left his seat and joined him on the tee. There were a few boos, but only by people who were staring at their feet. Everyone else started chanting. The habitual cry of U-S-A! U-S-A! gave way to a chorus of “Don-ald-Trump! Don-ald-Trump!” Beautiful. Everyone loves DJT, the USA are going to win, bigly, and remember, folks, anyone who says otherwise is straight-up lying.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupGolffeaturesShareReuse this content"

The condition, which can only be diagnosed posthumously, is caused by repeated exposure to head trauma and is most commonly associated in the USwith tackle football players, in particular those who have made it to the NFL.The medical examiner “found unambiguous diagnostic evidence of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, also known asCTE, in the brain tissue of the decedent,” the statement read. “The findings correspond with the classification of low-stage CTE, according to current consensus criteria.”‘On call for brain retrievals’: the man who gets American football players examined for CTE after deathRead moreThe medical examiner conducted a brain examination as part of Tamura’s criminal autopsy after authorities found a note left by the attacker at the scene of the 28 July shooting, in which he expressed anger that his mental troubles may have been linked to playing football and requesting his brain be studied for CTE.Tamura claimed he had a traumatic brain injury and blamed theNFLfor “concealing the dangers to players’ brains to maximize profits”. “Study my brain please. I’m sorry,” he wrote.Though he never played in the NFL, authorities said Tamura, who drove across the country from Las Vegas toNew York, was targeting the NFL headquarters, which are located on a different floor of the Park Avenue building where the shooting took place.Four peoplewere killed in the shooting: a security guard at 345 Park Avenue, an executive at Blackstone, a police officer and an employee at Rudin Management.While CTE is most commonly associated with professional athletes such as former football players, boxers and hockey players, it has also been found instudentathletes, including those who did not play sports after high school or college.Evidence over the years has surfaced that collisions between players, which are routine in tackle football – even those that don’t appear to be as graphic as others – can be devastating to the health of the athletes.Tamura played high school football in California about a decade ago. His family previously said he suffered from migraines and mental illness, as well as multiple concussions.Dr Ann McKee, the director of the Boston University CTE Center, who has studied the brains of thousands of athletes, soldiers and others exposed to brain trauma, has said that little is known about the link between violent impulsive behavior and CTE – and that more studies must be done.She recentlytold the New York Times: “There is damage to the frontal lobes, which can damage decision making and judgment. It can also cause impulsivity and rage behaviors, so it’s possible that there’s some connection between brain injury and these behaviors.”The medical examiner’s findings add: “The science around this condition continues to evolve, and the physical and mental manifestations of CTE remain under study.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS crimeNFLUS sportsGun crimeHealthNeurosciencenewsShareReuse this content"

Reports at the time indicated Liverpool would honour the remainder of the 28-year-old’s contract, which was to run until 2027 and was understood to be worth around £140,000 a week.In an interview with Ally McCoist for TNT Sports, Slot confirmed that FSG has committed to paying Jota’s family the remainder of his contract. And he admitted finding it difficult to continue with professional life as normal, while thinking what Jota’s bereaved family are going through. The Liverpool head coach said: “The way the fans conducted themselves after that tragedy, how many flowers there were, all the memorials, I can almost get emotional thinking about it. It’s unbelievable what our fans have done and our players as well, the way they have conducted themselves in and around the funeral.“And then we have to train again. There are moments where I feel: ‘What must his wife and his children feel now?’ It sounds so hard but our life continues. People expect from me that I prepare them for ever and that sometimes feels a bit difficult knowing how hard it is for the family and for the parents in the phase they are still going through and will go through for the rest of their lives.”Slot added: “Owners are mainly criticised, like managers, but the way they’ve handled this situation by paying his wife and his children all the money from the contract is … Maybe people think it’s normal, but it is not in football.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolDiogo JotaFenway Sports GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

They offer the chance to compete in officially ranked events with many rounds without the financial pressures of overnight accommodation, and give amateurs and juniors a rare chance to take on established masters, with a chance of an upset result.This year the EnglishChessFederation has doubled the number of qualifying events for the UK Blitz Championship, whose final is at Leamington in November, from eight to 16, and organised three qualifiers in Greater London rather than just one. All three tournaments, in Hampton, Harrow and Golders Green, were well attended, especially the last, staged last Saturday.Blitz is three minutes per player per game, plus a two seconds per move increment.View image in fullscreen3991Juan Manuel Bellón v Max Fuller, Spain v Australia, Haifa Olympiad 1976. Black to move and win.Golders Green attracted a strong entry of grandmasters and international masters, headed by the former world semi-finalist Jonathan Speelman and England’s youngest ever GM Shreyas Royal, 16, who were expected to provide high-class competition among themselves for the single qualifying place. Instead, there was almost a shock result as a little-known teenager downed several GMs and IMs and missed qualifying by just half a point.Kai Hanache, 13, a pupil at the Charles De Gaulle Lycée in Kensington, London, defeated three grandmasters and three international masters, and also set a rating record at the 15-round UK Blitz qualifier. His result was totally unexpected, as his only notable previous blitz achievement was his silver medal in the World Under-10 Blitz in 2022.Hanache’s rating at the start was a modest 2037, strong amateur level, but he won against three grandmasters, including last month’sBritish Championship runner-up Stuart Conquest, for a tournament performance of 2448, international master standard.Conquest explained to the Guardian: “I’d only decided to play the tournament the night before, and the first round was already a cold shower, the single draw in the whole of that round after I was stone-cold winning. In round two, I hung a whole rook. After that, I gradually worked my way up the boards.“In the game with Kai, I made up 4…h6 at the board. His h4-h5 was a standard plan, a K-side cramp and asking what I’m doing. I floundered with 8…Rc8, but it’s a move I used against Peter Roberson in our British Championship tie-break match in a similar position.“I had a bad feeling about 23…f6 later, and I was uncomfortable, nothing to do but be patient.“After it he made his moves quickly and purposefully, and the outcome was soon clear, especially since I had not a glimmer of counterplay.“He was most unlucky not to get the qualifying spot, as Lorin D’Costa was busted on the next board before recovering. I hadn’t even come across Kai’s name until now, but he struck me as being well mannered and we had a brief chat after the game.”There could have been a fourth GM victim, but Hanache agreed a draw with Eldar Gasanov, the 2023 and 2024 UK Open Blitz champion, when a clear pawn up.His blitz rating gain from this single event on Fide’s October list due out early next week is expected to be a whopping 291 points, easily breaking the record single tournament gain by a 2000+ player of 188 points set by India’s Aaditya Dhingra in Serbia in 2023. England’s Bodhana Sivanandan gained 328 points from a single event in 2022, but that wasfrom a much lower starting base.At his previous event, the Fide world rapid/blitz teams in London in June, Hanache’s blitz performance was subpar, but he scored 6/9 in rapid to help Hammersmith win a team award. He has an hour’s coaching a week from a Russian GM.Hanache’s scorecard below shows that he met very strong opposition, including 10 of the top 11 seeds. He was leading the entire field of 125 at halfway with 7.5/8, before his only two defeats, one of them to IM D’Costa, who qualified for November’s final in third place.View image in fullscreenKai Hanache’s scorecard at the UK Open Blitz Championship qualifier.D’Costa achieved victory in the final round, thus eliminating Hanache from qualification, by recovering from a lost position, then winning the difficult theoretically drawn endgame of rook and bishop against rook. The top two finishers, GM Shreyas Royal and the blitz specialist FM Stanley Badacsonyi, both 16-year-olds, were already qualified from previous events. Final leading scores were Royal 12.5/15, Badacsonyi and D’Costa 12, Hanache 11.5.Outlier quantum jumps like this often involve slices of luck such as rivals blundering, but Hanache simply outplayed his opponents. Apart from the impressive game against Conquest, his most convincing victory was as Black against the Canadian IM Jonathan Tayar, the No 5 seed, in round seven, in whichhe overwhelmed his opponent’s back rank.View image in fullscreenKai Hanache missed qualifying by half a point.Photograph: Patrick HanacheEugenia Karas, the rising talent from St Paul’s Girls School whose favourite opening is 1 Nf3 and 2 b3, qualified as top woman with 8.5, edging out the veteran WGM Sheila Jackson on 8.There are still four UK Blitz qualifiers to come this weekend, at Birmingham on Saturday and at Edinburgh, Leeds and Manchester on Sunday, Entries are accepted until 6pm on the previous day.

The club’s medics and Palmer himself (reluctantly, you suspect) have decided that rest is the only cure for the groin issue that has held him back at various points this season.Palmer will sit it out against Brighton on Saturday, Benfica and José Mourinho on Tuesday and Liverpool next Saturday; all of the matches are at Stamford Bridge. It will then be taken as read that Palmer will not be able to join up with England for the friendly with Wales at Wembley and the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreIt will be Thomas Tuchel’s fourth camp as the England manager and his third without Palmer because of injury. Which is not ideal in the countdown to the World Cup. The hope at Chelsea is that their main man will be revived by the time they go to Nottingham Forest on 18 October.And yet, once the Palmer news had been digested, it was actually easy to be assailed by all of the other stuff that is testing Maresca as he reels from a sticky sequence of results and goes into a week that could define the early season for him.The manager revealed he would be without Tosin Adarabioyo until after the international break because of a calf problem; the centre-half felt it in the wake of last Saturday’s 2-1loss at Manchester United, where he came on after the early dismissal of the goalkeeper Robert Sánchez.With that in mind, the last thing Maresca needed was for his back-up goalkeeper, Filip Jörgensen, to come for a third-minute high ball at Lincoln in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night and punch Wesley Fofana in the head as they both looked to clear.Fofana was able to play on and he lasted the 90 minutes asChelsea won 2-1. But he would later present symptoms of concussion and must now observe the relevant protocols, meaning he cannot play for 12 days after the incident. So another central defender will miss Brighton, Benfica and Liverpool.Levi Colwill is a long-term knee injury absentee and Benoît Badiashile has not played all season and only just returned to training, making him a doubt for Brighton. Maresca’s options at centre-half could extend no further than Trevoh Chalobah and Josh Acheampong. The latter has been ill this week, re-entering the group for training on Thursday.It is no exaggeration to say that Maresca has problems throughout the spine of his team – from back to front. The recklessness of Sánchez’s red card has been well documented, leading to a one-game ban, which he served against Lincoln.View image in fullscreenWesley Fofana (right) played 90 minutes against Lincoln but later showed symptoms of concussion after a clash with Filip Jörgensen.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesBut if Jörgensen was not great when he replaced him at Old Trafford, failing to come for the high ball that led to United’s second goal, he endured a horrible evening at Lincoln. There were Chelsea fans who thought his connection with Fofana was the only time he located a spherical object. Sánchez is poised to return against Brighton, his previous club, with a point to prove.In midfield, Maresca is without Dário Essugo, who is a long-term casualty, and Roméo Lavia – like Badiashile – has only just rejoined for training, having not played this season. He is also a doubt. “Roméo and Benoît are better,” Maresca said. “We’ll see if they can join us. Otherwise it will be for the next one.”With Palmer out, it is an irritation that Facundo Buonanotte, who is on loan from Brighton, is ineligible to face his parent club. Liam Delap’s hamstring injury-absence squeezes Maresca’s options up front. Could the winger Tyrique George continue as the No 9, where he filled in at Lincoln?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Six, if the striker Marc Guiu is included; Maresca has said that the 19-year-old needs to improve.The theme is physical strain and how to cope with it because it appears to be pressing everywhere. Take João Pedro, a starter in each game until Lincoln when Maresca rested him, admitting the striker was feeling something. João Pedro had his first training session of the week only on Thursday.“João is better from the problem,” Maresca said. “Since he arrived with us he has played almost every game. So probably that is the reason why he has some problem. In some moments we need to think about giving him some rest.”It remains impossible to ignore the hangover from the Club World Cup, where Chelsea were victorious, even though Maresca continues to say it is unclear whether the unusually short pre-season that followed has been an issue.Since the home win over Fulham at the end of August, Chelsea have conceded a stoppage-time equaliser at Brentford andlost at Bayern Munichand United before the Lincoln result. Maresca’s switch to 5-2-1-1 at United after the Sánchez sending-off was criticised and he has had to defend the club’s decision to cast Axel Disasi and Raheem Sterling into exile.Maresca made it clear that Disasi would not be recalled to answer the problems in central defence. “There is not any information from the club to consider that so at the moment he is not an option,” he said. Maresca, though, recognises the need for solutions.Explore more on these topicsChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

But then, most of them don’t have to square up against Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo every weekend.The Ghana international has been key to Bournemouth’s excellent start to the Premier League campaign – the club have taken a better-than-expected 10 points from a possible 15 after a raft of summer sales, despite a five-game opening slate that was the second-hardest in the league,according to Opta.Semenyo’s season-opening brace against Liverpool turned heads, but his continued performances in the Cherries’ four-game unbeaten run since have kept their attention. The onlyPremier Leagueplayers with more progressive carries forward ending with a scoring chance are Everton’s Jack Grealish and Liverpool’s Cody Gakpo.And beyond all of this, at a more basic level, he’s a joy to watch. When Semenyo gets the ball – wherever that might be – the geometry of the pitch seems to shift to his will. Passing lanes bend toward him or for him, defenders lose their balance, and every Bournemouth counter seems to build to the same inevitability: Semenyo running into open space, ball at his feet, opposing defenders left guessing whether to retreat or dive in. And either choice is frequently the wrong one.Semenyo is the epitome of the elegant, sharp, progressive counterattacking forward we’ve all grown to love. He’s a shark balling out for a minnow. A bored commentator’s weekend lifeline. A neutral’s dream.This was of course all on display against Liverpool. His two late goals unsettled the Reds, even if they weren’t enough to best the champions in the end. (Bournemouth ended up conceding two late goals of their own). But it was the second goal that showed why he’s different.After a broken Liverpool attack, Semenyo received the ball deep in Bournemouth territory, a part of the pitch where many forwards would simply try to clear their lines. Instead, Semenyo sprinted into the space gifted to him by an overcommitted Liverpool midfield. The ball never left his stride, always close enough to invite panic, never loose enough to give hope, as he sprinted upfield at Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté. Both defenders tried to corral Semenyo, angling their bodies to funnel him wide or force a rash shot.Instead, Semenyo used his opponents’ bodies – and their hesitation – against them, twisting them into angles they didn’t want to be in, or even knew existed. By the time he reached the edge of the area, both centre-backs were turned inside out, while goalkeeper Alisson Becker stood rooted to the ground as Semenyo rolled a tidy finish past him.What stands out isn’t just the goal itself but the way Semenyo created it. He didn’t need a stepover, a trick, or a shoulder barge to break open one of the league’s most experienced back lines. He simply ran at them, letting the backpedalling defenders reveal their own weaknesses with every step. This is Semenyo’s artistry: he doesn’t beat players in isolation so much as force them to beat themselves, their bodies turned against them by his timing, balance, vision, and stride.Again, it’s important to note that the data supports the eye test, and that Semenyo’s direct play is nothing new. Last season, he ranked in the top 10 in the Premier League for both progressive carries and progressive runs – an analytics junky’s dream. His profile is almost perfectly built for the modern game: receive, turn, carry, destabilize. And yet even those numbers don’t quite capture how it feels in real time, the sense that every touch is measured, every stride controlled, every defender pushed into a decision they can’t win.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They don’t need Semenyo to operate in the suffocating moments bigger clubs so often face. (Low blocks. Time wasting. More low blocks. More time wasting.) Instead, they lean into a pressing, counterattacking identity that leaves grass to run into and channels to exploit. In that system, Semenyo is a pure fit. His runs stretch the field, his carries turn defensive shape into disarray, and his decisive finishing punishes hesitation.The south coast has been blessed with big talents before, but Semenyo feels different – a player whose style and numbers put him in the shop window more or less automatically.For now, though, the miracle is real: one of the Premier League’s most distinctive forwards, running loose at the Vitality, turning ordinary games into good ones and good games into unforgettable ones. Semenyo is not just Bournemouth’s difference-maker. He’s one of the league’s great joys, and worth savoring in the context of one of the new season’s pleasant surprises.Explore more on these topicsBournemouthPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 25-year-old was then pictured smiling in a restaurant holding a pair of chopsticks and he also posted the cover of Jim Murphy’s bestseller Inner Excellence – described by its author as an “instruction manual that will teach you how to perform under pressure and live the best possible life”.Liverpool defender Giovanni Leoni out for rest of season with ACL injuryRead moreBut most intriguing was the passage he posted from Proverbs 23:18 which reads: “Surely there is a future and your hope will not be cut off.” Almost four weeks on from a dramatic transfer deadline day when Palace’s chair, Steve Parish,pulled the plug on Guéhi’s moveto Liverpool at the last minute, there has been no mention of what happened from the player himself other than in a post-match interview with ITV in Belgrade. “It’s been great,” he said with a smile when asked how the previous eight days had been.On Saturday at Selhurst Park, Guéhi will face the club he had hoped to join. He showed he had been able to put the failed transfer behind him with two impressive performances for England that appeared to nail down his spot under Thomas Tuchel after he was surprisingly named on the bench for the head coach’s first gameagainst Albania in March. “He handles it with respect and with a brilliant attitude,” Tuchel said.Oliver Glasner has also wanted to move on from the episode that ended with Palace’s manager keeping hold of his captain after they failed to find an adequate replacement, although he did admit Guéhi had been disappointed not to join Liverpool. “Sometimes my children would like to have something,” he said. “Then you have to say: ‘Sorry, not this time.’ They’re disappointed, but the next day, it’s gone.”It speaks volumes for Guéhi’s professionalism that he has picked up where he left off at Palace having already mentally prepared to become a Liverpool player. The first part of his medical had been completed in London on deadline day and a private jet was standing by to take him to Merseyside. Guéhi is understood to have been extremely unhappy and surprised when Parish – under pressure from Glasner – decided not to sanction the £35m move, and Palace stand to lose him for free next summer when his contract expires. Yet there has been no sign of discontent and his performances have underlined the player’s quality.A back three where he excels on the left alongside the central axis, Maxence Lacroix, and Chris Richards has recorded 11 clean sheets in the 20 Premier League games they have played together. Palace have the joint-best defensive record in the Premier League this season, having conceded twice so far, and have not been beaten in 17 matches since a5-0 defeat at Newcastlein April.Despite being only 6ft tall, Guéhi is also a considerable threat at set pieces for Palace, who scored 11 league goals from corners last season, behind only Arsenal. Liverpool, beaten by Glasner’s side on penaltiesin the Community Shieldlast month when Guéhi was forced off with cramp in stoppage time, are the division’s only other unbeaten side in the division, and will surely have taken note before they renew acquaintances with the FA Cup winners.View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi, in action against West Ham’s Lucas Paquetá last weekend, has not tasted defeat with Palace since April.Photograph: Martin Dalton/ShutterstockThe serious knee injurysustained by Liverpool’s Giovanni Leoniin Tuesday’sCarabao Cup win over Southamptonhas heightened concerns over a lack of defensive cover in Slot’s squad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Otherwise Liverpool have to wait until the summer when they are likely to find themselves up against some of Europe’s biggest hitters, including Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich.Some reports this week suggested that Guéhi favours a summer move to Madrid, who are also closely monitoring his Palace and England teammate Adam Wharton. Madrid’s longstanding interest in Liverpool’s Ibrahima Konaté, who has so far rejected Liverpool’s attempts to get him to extend a contract that, like Upamecano’s, ends in the summer, potentially provides another layer of complication over Guéhi’s future.Not that the speculation will affect his performances. Guéhi, who moved to London from Ivory Coast with his family at the age of one, still lives at home with his three younger sisters and regularly attends services at his father’s church in Grove Park, south-east London, with Lacroix and other members of Palace’s first-team squad. “Until recently, he didn’t even have social media, maybe he’s got one now just to interact with fans,” his father, John, who is known as Papa Guéhi, told the Sun this month. “He never thought: ‘If I force a move, Palace will let me go.’ No. He was focused and stayed professional and he always will.”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the feeling in the first minutes [of a match] – it’s really important. So for me since we started the first training [this week], we start talking about that. We need to understand the opportunity we have to win the next game [and build momentum]. The responsibility is on us. We need the sense of urgency that we need to win, no matter what. It’s going to be really difficult.”Amorim has previously stated that last season he did not know how his team would play. While he remains somewhat unsure, there is much more confidence in his players now. “I always have the feeling that we can win the next game and we can be dominant,” he said. “[But] sometimes in the small things [I am unsure] – in our urgency [for example]. If you compare the way we start against Chelsea compared to the way we start against Manchester City [it] is completely different.“I am not certain all the time what is going to happen and I am really clear on that with you and with the players, but the feeling is completely different. I look at my team [when] I am going to play against City, Arsenal, and I am feeling we can score goals, we can be dominant, we can control the game in certain moments. So it is feeling completely different from last year.”Amad Diallo is not available for the trip toBrentforddue to compassionate leave.

Leicester were staring down the barrel of a second league defeat of the season but a late equaliser extended their own unbeaten run to five matches while denying West Brom the chance to climb into the top two before the rest of the weekend’s action.The hosts were looking to respond to back-to-back defeats and they went ahead in the 10th minute thanks to a brilliant goal from Samuel Iling-Junior, who grabbed his first in West Brom colours. The visitors were limited to half-chances in the second period in what looked to be a frustrating second half until Phillips put into his own goal which sent the travelling contingent wild as Leicester rescued a fifth point from losing positions this season.Leicester started brightly and a decent chance fell the way of Jordan Ayew in the third minute but he sent a one-touch finish across goal. West Brom had the opening goal of the contest with their first real foray forward and finished thanks to a piece of brilliance from Iling-Junior. Aune Heggebø flicked it off to the England Under-21 international and he danced his way round the challenge of several defenders before he slipped the ball beyond the onrushing Jakub Stolarczyk.View image in fullscreenSamuel Iling-Junior races away after giving West Brom an early lead.Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/ShutterstockThat did not seem to knock the spirit of Leicester who showed plenty of intent going forward, Jordan James saw an effort deflect over the bar before Harry Winks tried an audacious volley but Joshua Griffiths was yet to be troubled.Jayson Molumby forced Stolarczyk into the first save of the contest with an effort from range and was alert enough to keep out Heggebø a couple of minutes later. Griffiths was brought into action straight after the interval as a cross picked out Jannik Vestergaard but he was not able to power his header beyond the goalkeeper.West Brom could have had a second when Ayew failed to deal with a ball into the box and the ball fell kindly for George Campbell but whacked it into the side netting from a tight angle.Josh Maja came off the bench and twice had a chance to bury the contest, firstly when his goalbound effort was blocked behind by Wout Faes before Maja blasted over with the goal at his mercy in stoppage time. And Leicester punished him for those missed chances when they levelled the scores three minutes into stoppage time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arteta said he had spoken to him about some of the speculation from Spain and been assured the Frenchman was committed to Arsenal.Referring to speculation from Spain over Saliba’s future, Arteta said: “When you hear that noise you can understand certain expectations. Players have feelings, maybe dreaming about something one day, and that’s a really natural thing to have. When I sat down with William and I asked him the question, he said: ‘No, I want to stay here, I want to play for you and I’m very happy’ – in his own way – so that’s great to hear.”On Sunday Arsenal are at Newcastle, where they have lost on four of their past five visits, and Arteta acknowledged it would be a test of their title credentials.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The club have undergone significant changes at boardroom level this year, the most dramatic beingDaniel Levy’s departureas chair at the beginning of the month.Levy was moved aside by the Lewis family, the ultimate owners, who have put a leadership team in place featuring Vinai Venkatesham as the chief executive and Peter Charrington as nonexecutive chair.Lord Ashcroft’s son Andrew takes over father’s 3.4% stake worth £100m in TottenhamRead moreSpurs have been stalked by takeover talk for a long time and Levy’s ousting intensified it, with two groups making moves for control. One was Amanda Staveley’s PCP International Finance, the other a consortium of investors led by Dr Roger Kennedy and Wing-Fai Ng through Firehawk Holdings Limited. The club rejected both, with sources close to the Lewis family insisting the club were not for sale.Earick, who is a former DJ, and his backers have tried to muscle in and they have been given the same message. A Lewis family source said: “This unsolicited and unnecessary interest does nothing to change the family’s resolve and commitment to do whatever it takes to drive success on the pitch. The club is not for sale.”Vivienne and Charles Lewis, the children of the former Spurs owner Joe Lewis, have assumed greater influence and prominence since Levy’s exit. They are open to fresh investment, which is needed to drive the club’s varied plans to expand the business. But their position is that a full sale is not a possibility.Earick’s interest in Spurs was first reported by the Sun. He posted screen grabs of its coverage on Friday, noting on his Instagram story that it had been a “pretty low key morning so far”. On X, he wrote: “Due to all the press speculation, my legal counsel has advised me to clarify the situation. Unfortunately, I will not be DJing an absolute banger of a drum & bass set at the Ministry of Sound tomorrow.”Spurs were obliged to issue a statement to the London Stock Exchange. They said: “The board ofTottenham HotspurLimited is aware of recent media speculation and confirms that its majority shareholder, Enic Sports & Developments Holdings Ltd, has received, and unequivocally rejected, an informal expression of interest in relation to a proposal to acquire the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of the club from a consortium led by Mr Brooklyn Earick (‘the Consortium’).“The board of the club and Enic reconfirm that Tottenham Hotspur is not for sale and Enic is not looking to sell its stake in the Club.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leoni, recently called up to the Italy squad for the first time, faces surgery and an extensive rehabilitation period.Liverpool reward Rio Ngumoha’s promise with first professional contractRead more“He is not in a good place, of course, because he tore his ACL and it means he will be out for around a year,” said Slot on Friday. “Being so young, coming to a new country and playing so well in your first game … it’s very hard to take the positive side. There’s never a positive side but he is still so young so he has many years to go after he recovers from a terrible injury like that.”Liverpool agreed a deal to sign Marc Guéhi from Crystal Palace on deadline day only for the Palace chair, Steve Parish, to abort the transfer under pressure from his manager, Oliver Glasner. Leoni’s absence may increase the likelihood of the Premier League champions making another move for the Palace captain in January. Slot, whose league leaders travel to Selhurst Park on Saturday, was noncommittal on whether he could play the rest of the season with three specialist central defenders but insisted he did not want a bloated squad.“That all depends on whether we get more injuries and if there’s a chance in the market,” said Slot on the prospect of January reinforcements. “But I would not prefer to go to 24, 25 players. If there is a situation – and touch wood there isn’t – where I lead a team that has four or five injuries throughout the whole season, then it might be smarter to go to 24, 25. But recent history with Feyenoord and last season as well showed that we have a good record until now.“That is a certain risk. If we have five or six injuries at the same time then we would end up with 15, 16 players and that would normally be difficult. So it’s a choice I like to make but I think it is also a financial choice that we as a club have to make. If we want to keep these top players, we cannot have 24, 25 of them.”Slot confirmed that Liverpool intended to add Federico Chiesa to their squad list for the Champions League’s league phase after Leoni’s injury.

Leigh started with a period of relentless pressure, Umyla Hanley just denied on the end of Lachlan Lam’s kick through before Hanley popped a pass to Brand to skip over in the corner for the opener.View image in fullscreenJosh Charnley touches down for Leigh.Photograph: Nigel French/Bradley Collyer/PAPoor handling was hardly helping the Wakefield cause, Josh Griffin’s knock-on allowing Joe Ofahengaue to barge within inches, and the inevitable second try soon followed when Lam scooped a short pass to Hanley, whose burst set up Liu to crash over the last tackle.Charnley scooted over on the opposite flank to extend the home side’s lead and Wakefield’s welcome spell of pressure came much too late for the massed ranks of visiting fans behind the posts.The away side at least showed signs of fight and Jayden Myers’s persistence got them over for their opener within four minutes of the restart after a lovely floated pass from the impressive Mike McMeeken. But Mason Lino missed his kick from the touchline and a subsequent O’Brien penalty ensured the hosts retained their comfortable advantage heading towards the hour mark.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Owen Farrell was rarely far from the action on his second Saracens debut – 17 years after his first – and though Nathan Michelow was shown the Prem’s first 20-minute red card for the visitors, this was an illustration of the length of the road ahead for the Red Bulls.Newcastle are not the first side to struggle to escape Saracens’ stranglehold and there were certainly some bright moments. The No 8 Amanaki Mafi was the pick of the summer signings, while Kingston Park has rarely been as vibrant as this in recent years and the manner in which a first sellout crowd in seven years celebrated Freddie Clarke’s try, with the game already up, felt telling. Truth be told, however, this was more reality check than revolution.“I don’t want to be guilty of drinking the Kool-Aid,” said Newcastle’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond. “What’s happened around the place is fantastic and you can see that, but we’ve got to get our basics right. A bit more graft on the training paddock. It was hard work getting a sellout and we’ve got to match the commercial side of the business on the field.”View image in fullscreenAlex Hearle got Newcastle’s new era off to a lightning start with a try after just 90 seconds.Photograph: Bruce White/Colorsport/ShutterstockFarrell, starting at inside centre for Saracens for the first time in a decade, was a commanding presence for the visitors. He looks a touch bulkier so perhaps No 12 is his future position for club, and maybe even country. Farrell kicked 12 points, with Brandon Jackson, Andy Onyeama-Christie, the excellent Nick Tompkins (twice) and Noah Caluori all crossing for tries on an evening that began with sparkle for the Red Bulls but finished decidedly flat. It was 19-year-old Caluori who provided the champagne moment on his debut, dexterously kicking a chipped ball ahead before gathering and racing away to the line.Given the sense of occasion it was little surprise that Newcastle began quickly. A sustained period of pressure forced a wide-open gap in the Saracens defence and Alex Hearle timed his run on to the pass perfectly to dash to the try-line after 90 seconds. Newcastle fans feared the worst when the referee Adam Leal went upstairs but a tip-tackle by Michelow on George McGuigan had been spotted in the buildup and Saracens’ 21-year-old was given his marching orders.Quick GuideBath roar back to beat Quins despite Evans hat-trickShowA first-half hat-trick from the Harlequins flanker Will Evans proved in vain as reigning champions Bath got the new Gallagher Prem season off to a winning start with a 47-31 comeback victory at Twickenham Stoop.Bath were rattled in the first half by an enterprising Quins and trailed 17-7 at one stage. But once Chandler Cunningham-South had received a yellow card, there was only one team in the contest as Bath scored 33 unanswered points.Jack Kenningham and Tyrone Green were the hosts' other try scorers with Jarrod Evans converting two. Bath responded with seven tries. Henry Arundell grabbed a pair with Tom Dunn, Ben Obano, Billy Sela, Archie Griffin, Henry Arundell and Sam Underhill also on the scoresheet, while Ben Spencer added five conversions and Tom de Glanville one.The Bath director of rugby, Johann van Graan, described the victory as \"clunky\", adding: \"Quins put us under a lot of pressure. They pressed at the breakdown and we didn't react quickly enough and were happy just to be only 17-14 down at half-time.\"We showed good composure in the second half by scoring straight away and it was a good performance after the interval to pick up five points as it's never easy coming here.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Saracens were shell-shocked but got themselves on the scoreboard with a Farrell penalty. Before 10 minutes were on the clock, Farrell was in the thick of things again, taking a whack on the face when trying to tackle McGuigan. Blood was streaming from his splattered face but, as he tends to, Farrell soldiered on regardless.Having weathered the early storm Saracens were ahead before they were back to 15 men, Jackson finishing in the right-hand corner after sharp hands from Tompkins. Farrell missed the conversion and not long after a crucial turnover by Mafi, Newcastle were back ahead with a Brett Connon penalty. Saracens flexed their muscles again before the interval, however, systematically going through the phases before Onyeama-Christie splashed over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "Content": "12.56 EDTNotts revel in title triumph after beating WarwickshireTanya AldredNottinghamshire’s season ended with a day to spare, Championship title already secured, 10-wicket victory overWarwickshirein the bag. During the 3.4 overs in the afternoon gloom that they needed to knock off the winning 18 runs, there was time for Ben Slater to become the ninth man in Division One to reach a thousand runs, and for Haseeb Hameed to hit the winning boundary, a one-kneed good-night caress, that zipped across the grass and over the rope.Minutes later, the club had set up a trestle table in front of the Hound Stand, and members gathered for the presentation. Families mingled everywhere, including Hameed’s proud parents, two sisters, brother-in-law and baby niece, on her first trip to Trent Bridge.The ECB’s Neil Snowball handed over the medals, Hameed removing his ever-present white floppy hat and taking the trophy to lift with his team. Soon the coaching staff joined the party, head coach Peter Moores wearing a tan jacket over his green hoodie. On closer inspection, the tan jacket had been embroidered in green thread with the initials MOM. “When our first overseas Fergus O’Neill came over, he went and found the jacket in a charity shop, got it dry cleaned, got it sent off and embroidered and presented it at the end of the first match for the moment of the match,” said Moores. The jacket’s recipient was then responsible for awarding it in the next match.Moores was expecting Josh Tongue, hero of the Oval, to hand the jacket back to Hameed today. But he didn’t, Tongue gave it to Moores. “It was lovely,” said Moores. “I’m not one for big emotion in the dressing room but I was properly made up.”Tongue, wrapped in cotton wool by England for this game, was back in his whites and wearing his Nottinghamshire cap for the ceremony, towering over his teammates, 31 wickets at 22.03 under his belt. “Words can’t really describe how I’m feeling at the minute,” he said. I’ve always wanted to win a Division One Championship and to win it my first proper year here after missing last season is incredible.“Taking five wickets in my debut game against Durham sort of proved to the lads why it was worth me coming here. I’ve obviously been in and out of the team with England but coming back it just feels such a special place at the minute.“It was tough last year and I took myself away from the ground at times and spent time with family but then also I still want to support the lads as well so I still came in.“I was in a very bad place but Chris Marshall, our sports psychologist, was brilliant during that tough time and a lot of credit for getting me back out there goes to him.Meanwhile, at Southampton, in a classic county cricket moment, the teams went off for bad light withHampshire148 for nine, still 33 short of the victory that would almost definitely keep them in Division One. Set 181 to beatSurrey, they collapsed from 61 for none to 148 for nine, a suitable coda for what has been a miserable couple of weeks. Rahul Chahar, in his first Championship appearance, got stuck into a turning pitch and finished with seven for 45.Two hundred miles north, fellow relegation candidatesDurhamandYorkshirewere also off for bad light, and watching events on the live stream. A Hampshire defeat saves Yorkshire’s bacon and leaves Durham needing only a (likely) draw to be safe. A Hampshire victory, means Yorkshire need a draw and Hampshire a longest of long shots win. In the words of Durham coach, Ryan Campbell, “Sleepless nighter! ... it’s a funny game. This afternoon, the old cricket gods have handed us a card. Obviously you don’t wish bad on anyone else. But, if you don’t play well in this competition, you get found out.”ShareUpdated at15.14 EDT"

The former Arsenal academy player was taken to hospital and placed in an induced coma,Chichester announced on Thursday that Vigar had died.The Professional Footballers’ Association’s chief executive, Maheta Molango, said on Friday that there needed to be a formal investigation into the accident, having first urged the FA to act on this issue two years ago. Molango’s call for an investigation was echoed by the Chichester MP, Jess Brown-Fuller.“Whilst the health and safety of participants and spectators at the National League System level is the responsibility of the clubs and their local authorities, we will now conduct an immediate review, working with leagues, clubs and relevant stakeholders across the game, that will focus on the safety of perimeter walls and boundaries around pitches in the National League System,” read an FA statement. “This will include looking at ways we can assist National League System clubs to identify and implement additional measures at their stadiums that they determine will help to mitigate any potential safety risks.”The PFA and then sports minister, Stuart Andrew, wrote to the FA, the Premier League, EFL and National League in June 2023 asking them to adopt a more proactive approach to player safety at pitch perimeters, in the wake of a similar incident in November 2022 whenBath player Alex Fletcher suffered a fractured skull.Wingate are understood to be in discussions with the relevant authorities. The club also issued a statement offering their heartfelt condolences, adding everyone at the club was “in shock at the death of a talented young man”.“I am shocked and saddened to learn of the death of Billy Vigar, who sustained a head injury while playing the sport he loved with Chichester City FC,” said Brown-Fuller. “Football brings community and joy to so many, and my thoughts are with Billy’s family, friends, teammates and supporters at this truly terrible time.“It is also important that the circumstances surrounding Billy’s injury are fully understood through a thorough investigation. Football has a unique power to bring communities together and is vital for people’s health and well-being. Players should feel safe playing at grounds across the country and I urge the sport’s governing bodies to take steps to ensure tragic accidents like this do not happen again.”Molango agreed with the need for a formal investigation into Vigar’s death. “All footballers should expect to be safe when they go out to play or train, and to not be put at unnecessary and avoidable risk by factors beyond their control,” he said. “When we previously highlighted potential safety issues in grounds and stadiums, the sports minister and I wrote to all the football authorities to urge them to be proactive on this and to make sure all their rules and regulations around player safety were fit for purpose.“Again, whilst it is important that a proper investigation is allowed to conclude, we have to ensure that opportunities to make grounds safer for players have not been missed and that players don’t feel that serious incidents involving their safety are necessary to prompt change.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Airport-style security, which was deployed for a second time near to the 1st hole, led to the competition organisers opening gates at 5am local time – more than two hours before play began – but heavy congestion was still clear as the event got under way.Traffic issues also led to spectators leaving tournament shuttle buses and walking through residential areas to Bethpage. One Ryder Cup attendee posted footage on social media of a power line exploding near the course; nobody is understood to have been injured but it served as an example of a chaotic morning.Trump, in the company of his granddaughter Kai, landed nearby on Air Force One shortly after 11am before being driven to the Bethpage clubhouse.

Users who do not take up the subscription will still see ads.The subscription offering issimilar to a service offered by Meta in the EU, which has been deemed in breach of the digital markets act – a piece of legislation designed to rein in big tech – by the bloc’s executive arm, the European Commission.The commission fined Meta €200m this year, stating the company should have launched a free version of its sites that used less detailed personal data, such as gender, age and location, for making targeted ads.The UK’s data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), said it welcomed the move.“This moves Meta away from targeting users with ads as part of the standard terms and conditions for using its Facebook and Instagram services, which we’ve been clear is not in line with UK law,” said an ICO spokesperson.This year the ICO said internet users should have an “opt out” from their data being used to create targeted ads, after Metasettled a court casewith a UK citizen over targeted ads.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Overall, American companies are expected to control just over 65% of the company, with Trump also naming the personal computer pioneer Michael Dell and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox as other investors.“[TikTok US] will be majority-owned and controlled by United States persons and will no longer be controlled by any foreign adversary,” Trump said. “We have American investors taking it over, running it [who are] highly sophisticated, including Larry Ellison. Great investors, the biggest. They don’t get bigger. This is going to be American-operated all the way.”TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, will retain a 19.9% stake in the US operation.China has not publicly made clear whether it will approve the deal, although Trump said that he had “had a good talk” with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who “gave us the go-ahead”.JD Vance, the US vice-president, said the deal valued TikTok US at $14bn. “There was some resistance on the Chinese side,” Vance said. “But the fundamental thing that we wanted to accomplish is that we wanted to keep TikTok operating but we wanted to make sure that protected Americans’ data privacy as required by law.”He added: “This deal really does mean that Americans can use TikTok, but actually use it with more confidence than in the past. Because their data is going to be secure and it’s not going to be used as a propaganda weapon against our fellow citizens.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.On a week-long trip to Paris last year, I racked up nearly $100 in data charges on my iPhone, with taxes and fees. Ditto for a separate, eight-day trip to Spain, which was even more pricey. And, in what I now jokingly call an act of piracy, my three-week trip to seven countries – including a seven-day cruise – cost me over $300 for data.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I (eventually) learned my lesson, and a little research yielded a simple solution that can make life a lot easier: Switching to a local carrier for your travels. This used to entail a visit to an airport kiosk or a mobile store to get a fingernail-sized plastic SIM chip installed in your phone, but a new feature called an eSIM lets you handle it all from your phone before you even leave. My eSim for Paris cost $11 for 5GB of data, plenty for checking emails, using Google Maps, and browsing social media (although I was careful not to upload photos until I had wifi access). In Spain, I spent $10 for 5GB.Here’s how it works, and how to use it on your next trip abroad.How eSims workView image in fullscreenPhotograph: CandyRetriever/Getty ImagesI got burned by roaming charges, which occur when you use cellular data outside of your home country. You can easily turn off roaming before youtravel, but then you’ll only be able to text and surf on wifi.An eSim is a temporary electronic add-on to your phone that lets you buy affordable short-term cell coverage on local carriers when you travel. You can buy individual eSim for each country from local carriers like Vodafone in the UK or Telcel in Mexico, but it’s much easier to use one of the new crop of apps that do all the heavy lifting for you.View image in fullscreenThe Airalo app.Composite: Courtesy of AiraloThree popular companies that offer eSims for international travel areAiralo(which I have used, and who provided some useful information for this article),SailyandHolafly. All three cover most popular destinations, and vary for more obscure locations. I recently traveled to Bhutan, for instance, and only Airalo had coverage there. Saily can sometimes be marginally cheaper than the others, but it’s worth checking all three. Holafly offers unlimited data only, so it’s a bit more expensive if you don’t need that.Skip Apple’s new iPhone – five tips to make your old phone feel new againRead moreMost phones newer than about 2021 accept eSims, but if you’re not sure, Airalo maintains acompatibility listthat makes it easy to check. You will also need to ensure your phone is unlocked, which typically means you’re not making payments on it to your carrier. In the event you are, most carriers will unlock it when the phone is paid off, either automatically, online, or with a phone call.Setup and picking a planView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Debalina Ghosh/Getty ImagesInstalling your eSim varies a bit depending on the provider, but they all make it easy: Just download the app and follow the instructions. It isn’t difficult, but there are a few steps involved, and you’re better off doing it before you leave for your trip. All of the providers listed offer support if you get into trouble, either on the website or through the app.Since most eSims only provide data and not voice service, you’ll need to use WhatsApp or other apps to make calls. If you do need a local number, Airalo has a package called Discovery+ that allows you to make voice calls and is available in more than 130 destinations.I travel 200,000 miles a year. This is the best travel backpack I can’t leave home withoutRead moreHow much data should you get? If you’re only going to check email, send a few texts a day, and do light web browsing and social media, 3GB to 5GB should be enough for a week trip. The 5GB plan I purchased for six days in Spain was more than enough. But I used wifi when downloading photos or streaming, and didn’t make any calls. If you intend to stream videos, peruse Instagram and make video calls, you might need closer to 10GB. If you game online, need video conferencing for work, download a lot of large photos and stream in HD, you could need even more.Once you’re all loaded up you can head out on your next adventure without worrying – well, at least not about your phone!Explore more on these topicsLife and stylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, there are many bike storage solutions, from basic floor anchors for a tiny outdoor space to fancy high-security sheds, and even secure parking provided by local authorities. One cycle storage entrepreneurwon £100,000 on Dragons’ Denfor his SpaceRail. Here are some of the best options I’ve come across, for inside the home, and out.The best bike storage ideasOutdoorsFor bikes parked outdoors, if security is one of your requirements (which it probably should be, even in a back garden), look for products that are Sold Secure rated: this means they are rigorously tested and certified to resist theft.Also, a word of warning if you’re thinking of installing a shed: metal ones heat up in the sun, so don’t allow any part of the bike that could melt (handlebars or tyres) to touch metal in full summer sun. Strategically place cloths between the two, or install insulation.For front or rear gardensView image in fullscreenThe fortress£915 at AsgardIf you’re lucky enough to have a front or rear garden, Asgard sheds are safe, good-looking and sturdy.Pricesstart at £649 for a two-bike shed. I tested the mammoth Annexe Plus E (for e-bike charging) in my front garden, which is Secured by Design (police) approved, and rated by the Loss Prevention Certification Board (LPCB) for security, which means it was tested using a plethora of break-in tools.The Plus E stores three to four bikes (essential: check your bike sizes first), with optional plug sockets for charging, shelves and hooks for gear. For an additional fee, Asgard’s staff will come and build it for you. I wasn’t sure I’d want to leave my expensive bikes in the front garden, but found the shed reassuringly safe, with its five-point locking double doors, including two deadbolts.The design details are great, with ventilation to prevent damp buildup, and it’s big enough to obscure my neighbours’ overflowing bins. It also weighs 176kg (27st 10lb), so it isn’t going anywhere easily. I’m still learning not to make too much noise opening and closing it.View image in fullscreenThe lifting-lid shed£629.99 at Shedstore£629.99 at Buy Sheds DirectTrimetals’ bike sheds are sturdy and well made but aren’t Secured by Design or LPCB rated, and you need separate padlocks to secure them when closed. The 6ft 4in x 2ft 9in (193 x 88cm) model will store up to three adult bikes, and comes with a 25-year panel guarantee. This one has a spring-assisted lid that lifts both the roof and front of the shed to save ducking while getting bikes in and out. However, dealing with two padlocks may prove a faff in the rain, or if you’re in a hurry – and the floor is sold separately (£89.99).For less fortress-like shed models, you can fit a special metal anchor to a solid floor and chain the bike to that – using the best-quality lock you can afford (see below).View image in fullscreenThe simple wooden shed£434 at Powersheds£445 at WickesThere are plenty of cheap wooden sheds available for £200-£300, but it’s worth forking out the extra for something decent if you can.Cycle insurer Bikmo recommendsbuying a tongue-and-groove model as overlapping wooden styles are flimsier and can warp, letting in the weather and thieves. Internal hinges are preferable because they prevent thieves from simply unscrewing them.Middle of the range is the Apex Bike Shed from Powersheds, which starts at £434 for the 6 x 2ft (183 x 61cm) model. This should store two bikes, but as ever, do check your bike sizes before buying. Powersheds products come with a 10-year guarantee, galvanised metal parts and extra-wide doors for easy access – although the hinges are on the outside.View image in fullscreenThe fancy wooden shedFrom £1,512 at the Bike Shed CompanyThe Bike Shed Company offers premium wooden sheds for up to five adult bikes, as well as off-the-shelf and bespoke wooden buildings for gardens. The cheapest model, the Pedalbase 2, fits two bikes (again: check your own bike size against the shed measurements). As well as doors, the roof opens and stays open with gas struts – making it easy to lift the roof up high. There’s even amodel shaped to fit beside a bay window. The timber is sustainably grown in the UK from FSC-accredited forests.The on-street solutionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nathaniel Noir/AlamyLucky you if you can get a shared on-street cycle-parking space near your home, as most councils don’t offer them and waitlists can be long. Thesehemi-cylindrical shared bike sheds, popping up in London, Bristol, Salford,Brighton, Edinburgh and Glasgow, are popular and efficient, fitting six bikes in the equivalent of one car’s parking space. A handful of companies make them, councils install them, and residents rent them. In London, one of these spotscost an average of £57.90 a yearin 2022.They’re popular: in Bristol, 40 new hangars werealmost fully booked within 90 minutes. In Waltham Forest, 4,305 people were on the waiting list in June, with 150 new applications a month on average (the council plans to provide another 300 units in the next year).You can join a waiting list solo or lobby the council with neighbours. Alternatively, if enough people contact manufacturers, such as Cyclehoop, they’ll let your council know there is demand. There’s even ajumbo model for cargo bikesand non-standard cycles.Anchors away!A minimalist solution for a small outdoor space, say an alleyway or similar, is a metal floor or wall anchor that you can cement or drill holes and fix into place, attaching a chain through your bike and the loop. Checkherefor Sold Secure-approved ground anchors. Then you can choose whether to throw a cover on the bike to protect it from the elements (see below).View image in fullscreenDiamond-secure£63.84 at Halfords£56.99 at AmazonThe Ankr by Hiplok is pricey, but it’s Sold Secure Diamond rated – the top bike security rating from the benchmark for quality bike protection. For your money, you get a “maximum security” steel ground and wall anchor for a bicycle or motorcycle. A rubberised cap helps prevent frame damage, and there’s a 10-year warranty. Perfect if your bike thieves are particularly determined, and/or armed with angle grinders.View image in fullscreenSilver-secure£25 at Argos£19.99 at AmazonThe Anchor10 from Oxford Locks is a Sold Secure Silver-rated wall and floor anchor made from hardened steel. Design features include bolts protected by a ball bearing that are covered when a lock is in place to evade theft. It’s been “five-minute-attack tested”, manufacturers say.The outdoor bike coverWhile it’s not ideal to leave your bike exposed to the elements, sometimes outdoors is the only option. Dutch cyclists leave theirs out all year round, as a rule. Bike covers come in various designs and price points and can be a low-cost solution to minimise rust and wear. Cheap options start at less than a tenner, and exceed £70 for premium covers for larger cycles. A price point somewhere in between is probably your best bet.View image in fullscreenThe classy overcoat£39.30 at SantafixieThe BikeParka Stash is a classy, fitted cover that hugs your bike’s front and rear wheels, with extra cinch straps to avoid water gathering. As a rider of medium-sized bikes, I found two that fit under one cover. Made from ripstop waterproof material, it features sealed seams, adjustable toggles and brass eyelets to help keep your bike snug and dry. As with all covers, beware of windy days: mine became a sail and my bikes fell over, scratching each other. There’s also acargo bike parka for £85.70and along tail bike with seats coverfor £79.95. Use it mostly in the winter months, and it’ll last longer (less UV damage), but BikeParka guarantees it for one year in full sun and more than three in the shade. Colleagues say theirs have lasted several years outdoors, compared with months for cheaper products – imagine leaving a tent out 24/7, while regularly wrestling it on and off an awkward metal object, for comparison.View image in fullscreenThe sturdy skin£60 at Stormskin£60 at AmazonStormSkin’s premium cover is bulky, and it will set you back, but it’s sturdy and will resist all but the most determined horizontal water spray. Reviewers have found it the most protective at-home cover (though it’s not especially portable, due to its size), with slits for bike locks, front and rear, so you can secure it at a bike stand.The heavy-duty backpack fabric is, StormSkin says, up to nine times thicker than rivals’ products, and made from 100% recycled fabric. It looks good too, with a palm print pattern. It just takes a while to get the bike all tucked in.View image in fullscreenThe budget option£18.99 at TredzThe Oxford Aquatex cover is a budget pick, but still a good choice to protect your steed(s) from the elements. There are three sizes, fitting up to three bikes inside. Made from 100-denier polyester, double-stitched, it’s a no-frills option, with no cinch pulls, just an elasticated bottom. It’s roomy enough for a larger bike, but this also means it flaps around in the wind more. If you have a pigeon or rook problem, perhaps it could double as a scarer.IndoorsThere are plenty of hooks and shelving systems available for storing bikes indoors, on a wall. Pretend your bike is a piece of art; maybe it is. Many of the below would also work in a garage or sturdy wooden shed.View image in fullscreenTyre hook£15 at Halfords£15.99 at HornitThe smallest bike hook is the tiny plastic Clug, from Hornit. The manufacturer claims installation is as easy as putting up a picture – with two screws – although it leaves one wheel on the floor. It’s a smart and popular option, and means you can also line up your bikes, like books on a shelf. Measure your tyre width before ordering one of the five sizes (23-32mm to 70-81mm). Make sure your tyres stay pumped, or the bike could fall – or go for theClug Pro, which holds the wheel in place with a small, strong thread and magnets. Mud pads are available to protect walls.View image in fullscreenRubber hooks£8.42 at DecathlonFor something simpler, cheaper and more versatile that will fully elevate your bike, simple hooks with rubberised covers are available for a few quid. Asthis YouTuberrecommends, attaching them to a wooden 2 x 4in or 2 x 6in baton rather than directly to your wall offers you stability, longevity and more bikes stored per metre. It will also help minimise damage to your walls from the large screws that accompany these hooks.View image in fullscreenNo-drill options£149.99 at Cyclestore£179.99 at HalfordsTopeak sells a few no-drill bike storage options. For a smaller footprint, the Dual Touch wedges between the floor and ceiling using an adjustable pole with a clever foot pedal clutch. There are mounts for two bikes, stacked in double-decker formation, but it can hold four, weighing up to 72kg, or 18kg a bike – depending on bike size and ceiling height.The key is finding a ceiling joist to wedge it under – I found mine by referring to an old photo from the time the kitchen ceiling fell in. Once installed, the Dual Touch is as sturdy as anything. My e-bike’s step-through frame is too awkwardly shaped, with most of its 25kg weight around the back wheel, so hanging it on two hooks wasn’t possible. My hybrid and road bikes hooked on easily, though. There’s also afree-standing option, with a tripod foot, requiring a little more floor space – popular at bike expos.Laura Laker has been writing about cycling for more than a decade.

I take a break for lunch and then get back on the computer for more quizzes,” he says. “It sounds like an illness, and others may diagnose it as that, but I am that obsessed. It’s not an exaggeration to say I treat it as an eight-hour job – a full-time day.”Schultz is Australia’s #1 ranked quizzer, the name for the people who take trivia very seriously. It’s a hobby he’s structured his entire life around. For about six weeks a year, Schultz films the Channel 7 show The Chase Australia, where he serves as one of the quizshow’s “chasers” – the experts whom contestants must topple if they want to take home the prize money (his nickname on the show, fittingly, is The Supernerd). The rest of the time, he’s just brushing up on his African capitals, AFL drafts or Academy Award winners.“What I should be doing is going out and doing other work, like a normal human being,” he laughs. “But hey, I’m a single man. I don’t have a family. I have no responsibilities … I’m in this unique situation where I have the time.”View image in fullscreenSchultz as the Supernerd on the Channel 7 show The Chase Australia.Photograph: The ChaseAnd it could be worse: “There are people, especially in the UK and USA, who are devoting even more hours to this than I am.”Quizzing is a niche but global pursuit, undertaken everywhere from North America to Europe and India, where it’s particularly popular. You might think of it as a step above pub trivia, particularly in terms of difficulty: Schultz used to play in pub teams seven days a week before levelling up. “When you get to international quizzing, pub trivia just isn’t obscure enough,” he says.In quizzing, typical questions might span the relatively straightforward (“Who was the military dictator of Chile from 1973 to 1990?”) through to more cryptic tasks, like naming the word that links a series of seemingly disparate images.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningAnd instead of taking place inside a rowdy watering hole, most of the time quizzing is undertaken in silence or solitude. The biggest event on the annual quizzing calendar is the World Quizzing Championships, held each June, where quizzers have two hours to write out their answers to questions read by a proctor in an exam-style in-person setting; as of 2024, Australia also has its own national championship, which was most recently held in February with venues in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. These competitions – which come with zero prize money – determine the national and global quizzer rankings, but devotees will also find other smaller competitions and Zoom leagues to keep busy with – and, as Schultz so diligently does, devote spare time to brushing up on their general knowledge.View image in fullscreen‘When you get to international quizzing, pub trivia just isn’t obscure enough’: Issa Schultz.Photograph: The Guardian“Mostly when I explain to people what I’m doing on the weekend, I say, ‘I’m going to a library to just sit in silence for an hour with a group of other nerds’,” says Sally Gridley, another of Australia’s enthusiastic quizzers. “We do an exam for fun. They’re like, are there prizes? I say, no, it’s just about the glory, and you pay to do it.”Gridley has been quizzing seriously for the last 11 years and even once won The Chase, with her team taking home $102,000 in prize money for their efforts. Quiz TV shows like The Chase and Mastermind are popular, both for the thrill and the fact that they’re the only real way to monetise their hobby. Gridley estimates Australia’s quizzing community to be made up of around only 30 to 35 regular quizzers; worldwide, theglobal leaderboardreveals an unofficial membership of just under 2,000. It is a small but dedicated scene, participants say – but one that is friendly, supportive and always welcoming to newcomers.‘One last nervous wee and bam!’: what it’s like winning Mastermind AustraliaRead moreIt is, however, dominated by a particular demographic: men. Gridley estimates she’s one of about eight regular female quizzers in Australia, putting the local scene at about 90% male – something she can best attribute to the social stigma of it being a “nerdy” pursuit that women perhaps don’t see themselves fitting into. And there’s overlap in other communities, too.“It takes one to know one, but quizzing is fairly [popular] in neurodivergent demographics as well – a lot of quizzers have conditions like autism or ADHD,” Gridley says. “And there’s lots of introverts. Like, I’m probably the most gregarious person in the room at any quiz function.”Or as Schultz puts it: “There’s a lot of eccentrics – and we love our eccentrics!”To make it up the leaderboard as a quizzer, one certainly must have the capacity for a certain type of obsession.View image in fullscreen‘It’s just about the glory’: quizzer Sally Gridley with her prize from ABC’s Hard Quiz.Photograph: Ellen Smith/The GuardianThirty-five-year-old finance worker Aaran Mohann, ranked third in Australia, considers himself less diligent with study than many others – devoting only around six hours a week to it. His primary tactic is to do as many online quizzes as possible, in the hope the answers burrow into his brain.

It’s a system that “makes no sense to anyone but myself”.He does draw a line, though: “Pat Gibson is one of the greatest British quizzers of all time and he reads something like five newspapers a day. I just can’t bring myself to do that – there’s too much bad news.”View image in fullscreenAustralia's representatives at the 2024 Quizzing Olympiad in Spain (Aaran Mohannis far right), with Jane Allen of the International Quizzing Association.Photograph: SuppliedEven outside the thrill of competition and TV turns, there’s a lot to love about being a dedicated quizzer. Gridley enjoys the sense of accomplishment that comes with getting an answer right, and the facts she’s gained along the way have proven beneficial in her job as a teacher. Mohann says the hobby rewards his natural curiosity about the world. Quizzing, which demands a close reading of the questions lest you disastrously name a city when the test paper actually asked for a country, has also sharpened his attention to detail.And for Schultz, there’s a calming consistency to the pursuit.“I love that it’s all about facts and truths, especially in this day and age when there’s AI and [fake news],” he says. “We can ignore all that and come back to, which King of England was beheaded in 1649? It was Charles I then, it will be Charles I tomorrow, it will still be Charles I in 100 years’ time.”Schultz loves the life he’s built around quizzing – for better or worse.“I’ve never driven a car. I can’t cook. I’m the sort of person who will lose his house keys … I think I’m a lost cause outside of quizzing. I’m doomed beyond compare.”Schultz’s focus now is retaining his #1 ranking in Australia – something he’s held every year since 2011 – and eventually climbing from a #15 world ranking to claim the #1 spot.“Usain Bolt, who’s the world’s fastest man, he’s devoted his entire life to running. So I’m willing to devote my entire life to quizzing,” he says. “I mean, why not?”Explore more on these topicsQuiz and trivia gamesSeven NetworkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s music, paintings or movies, the artist does their bit – but it’s the involvement of our own psyche that completes the circle. This is even more true for games, because we don’t sit for 100 hours in front of the Mona Lisa.Relationships with art change over time. I appreciated animation more when I was a younger man. I appreciate jazz much more today. I find the Mona Lisa alluring or boring depending on what mood I am in.This made playingClair Obscur: Expedition 33a fascinating prospect, because it is a game about art and our attempts to capture what we love in painting. At least I think that’s what it’s about. It’s complicated, as is my evolving relationship with the game. When I started playing it, I was bedazzled by its beauty – just like I was when I spotted my wife walking across an office nearly 30 years ago, lit by what seemed to be her own personal shaft of sunlight, like Glenn Close in The Natural. (RIP Robert Redford.)The characters are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, visually and aurally, with some of the best voice acting I have ever heard and a score that takes your breath away. I didn’t really understand the plot much at first; there’s something vaguely Logan’s Run about it, with people getting scrubbed from existence by someone (something?) called the Paintress when they reach a certain age. Each year a hardy band sets off on an expedition to find and defeat her, saving the next tranche of humanity from disappearing into dust and rose petals.View image in fullscreenClair Obscur’s brave adventurers attempt to escape the annualgommageevent that is slowly wiping them out.Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveBut I wasn’t too bothered by the plot because I was in love with how it looked and sounded, and sometimes it takes a while to understand your object of desire. There were other aspects I fell headlong in love with: a turn-based RPG lives or dies by the combat system and this has a dazzling (if initially confusing) array of moves, skills, counters and parries. But as I progressed and got to know it, the relationship deepened, and the combat system became glorious. It was so satisfying it made me forgive the mercifully rare but utterly shambolic attempts at platforming sections, which were so bad I wondered whether they were supposed to be a pastiche of the original Tomb Raider.Anyway, we ignore faults in those we love, don’t we?I spent way too much time with Expedition 33. I am a pretty pants player, and I like to grind a fair bit to make boss battles easier. The internet tells me that the game takes 30 hours to play. It took me more than 50 to get to the last boss, because I did something I rarely do with games these days: I played it at the default difficulty instead of easy story mode. The gameplay was so rewarding that I didn’t mind losing battles multiple times: learning the idiosyncratic timing of each battle became a reward in itself, like learning how to volley a football.As the days passed, though, I started to get irritated. There are no level maps, so you don’t know whether a path is a quick detour or a long, pointless waste of time. I got grumpy that the plot showed no signs of getting any less abstruse, with dialogue that was veering towards the pretentious (“Painting isn’t about verisimilitude, it’s about essence” – come on, man!). But I was committed to this game, for better for worse, in sickness and in health.Then something happened that ruined everything.After finally defeating the Paintress in a boss fight that took 30 minutes, the game … crashed.View image in fullscreenThe combat is so exciting that I didn’t mind failing – until …Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveCrashed. Booted me out to the title screen. I can’t remember the last time that happened to me with an Xbox game. I went online and found out this is a bug that many people have experienced. As far as I am aware, there isn’t even an update patch on Xbox Series S, and this game has been out since April. In relationship terms, my coitus was unforgivably interruptused. You simply cannot release a game with a bug that shatters you at the last moment like this.I found out you could work around this bug by pausing as soon as you get to the cutscene, but that means missing the cutscene.

After a plot twist that could only get more ludicrous if I understood it, there is a whole new third act.When I tried to carry on, I just felt resentment. Resentment at the time I had spent in my relationship with this game. Time I could have spent inotherrelationships.What had started as something new and beautiful had been tainted. Things I thought were cool (such as the friendship-building between characters that unlocks bigger and better moves) now seemed pedantic and clunky. The trust was gone. Could I really be arsed with another long, difficult boss battle if it was going to crash at the end?I’m not saying I am getting a divorce from Expedition 33.

Don’t expect Amazon to replace itNiamh RoweAmid financial struggles and presidential criticism, USPS is facing challenges. But it plays an essential role in US lifeFri 26 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 10.01 EDTShareIn towns where Washington DC is an abstraction, the post office is the front desk of American democracy – sometimes the only public space at all. Here, postmasters are “the human side of government”, as the senator Jennings Randolphput itin 1976. “When such offices are closed,” he warned, “the American flag really comes down.”Championed by Benjamin Franklin in 1775, the roots of the US postal service – whose mandate is to “bind the nation together” – are older than the republic itself. The constitution calls for “post offices and post roads”. The USPS is stilllegallyobligated to provide a “basic and fundamental” service to all Americans. In Scottsbluff, Nebraska, a rural carrier drives more than 700 miles a year to serve just two households.But after years in the red – and amid open hostility from theTrump administration– its future looks uncertain.The USPS has lost about $114bn since 2007, according to financial reports, amid declining letter volume, competition from private carriers and rising employee costs. Meanwhile, the specter of privatization looms larger than ever.“The postal service is a joke,” Donald Trumptoldreporters in 2020.A reform planduring his previous administration called for restructuring it “to return it to a sustainable business model or prepare it for future conversion from a Government agency into a privately-held corporation”.Given this historical scorn, it was no surprise when reports broke in February that Trump was consideringdissolvingthe agency’s leadership and absorbing it into the Department of Commerce.“The fate of the USPS is no longer financial or managerial, but political,” James O’Rourke, a professor of management at the University of Notre Dame, recently told me. “Putting the post office up for an IPO would not be much of a stretch in the current climate. The checks and balances are gone.”Indeed, a Wells Fargomemoto investors titled “USPS Privatization: A Framework” was leaked last month. It reads: “Parcel could be carved out and sold or IPOed.” The plan predicts parcel prices would increase 30%–140% across product lines and proposes a post office sell-off so that “value can be harvested” from the real estate.Yet if the parcel segment were “carved out”, not all of the carcass would bear meat. Investors will seize only the parts they can further monetize, O’Rourke says. That would mean closing small-town post offices and ending home delivery on unprofitable routes.Think of the mule train that descends into Havasupai territory in the Grand Canyon; the small aircraft and seasonal boats that serve Little Diomede, Alaska, where residents can see Russia from their windows; or Point Roberts, Washington, where mail crosses Canada to reach a US town. If universal service falters, those addresses are likely to be abandoned first.People in affected zip codes – already more likely to be lower income – will have to travel to pick up parcels or pay steep delivery costs. “Those people will do with less or do without,” O’Rourke says.But the cost of losing universal service would be more than financial. Vote-by-mail and absentee ballots are particularly critical in rural areas with distant polling stations, and the USPS ensures those ballots reach voters. It also handles 1.2bn prescription-drugshipmentseach year, as of 2020, according to the National Association of Letter Carriers union. In places with no nearby banks, the post office may be the only location where residents can pay bills.Rural postal workers also fulfill a civic role that transcends transporting mail. Astudyof village postmasters from the 1970s illustrates how closely woven they can become into civic life: “People going out of town commonly leave their house keys with the postmaster … residents leave notes with the postmaster for friends to retrieve later in the day.”While the advent of the internet renders that depiction somewhat antiquated, its essence remains true. “Rural carriers are still the fabric that knits some communities together,” Don Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, told me. In some towns, carriers may be the only contact residents have with the outside world – and thus a lifeline, he added. Carriers still carry out “wellness checks” if a resident fails to collect their mail.Mark Jamison spent 15 years as a postmaster in a remote office in the mountains of North Carolina, where he was the town’s only government worker. Many residents were not literate, so he assisted with written tasks. Older residents would stop by the post office on their way home so he could open their jars. He assembled bicycles at Christmas. Locals referred to him as the “bartender”, because people came in with stories to tell and advice to seek.“There are still postal employees who do that,” Jamison said.While the USPS has staved off a formal sell-off so far under the current administration, its universal service is already being eroded in de facto terms. This year, its 10-year “Delivering for America” modernizationplankicks off in a bid to saveat least$36 billion. The plan willslow servicefor about three-quarters of the country’s zip codes, according to the advocacy group Save the Post Office, withrural areasbearing the brunt. The Postal Regulatory Commission voiced opposition to the plan in January, noting it was “very concerned” about how it would disadvantage rural communities.Louis DeJoy, the former US postmaster general,announced a plan in Marchto cut 10,000 USPS jobs. Amid reports Trumpurged the USPS board of governorsto appoint FedEx board member David P Steiner as postmaster general, Brian Renfroe, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, alleged a “hostile takeover” of the postal service. (Steiner,who took the job in July, has saidhe does not believe the USPS should be privatized and that he believes “in the current structure of the postal service as a self-financing, independent entity of the executive branch”.)At the same time, Amazon Logistics is ontrackto surpass the USPS as the nation’s largest parcel carrier by volume. The company is also speeding up in rural America, as AI-driven efficiencies make more routes economically viable. In April, it announced a $4bninvestmentto expand its rural “last-mile” network – tripling its size by the end of next year and reaching 13,000 more rural zip codes.This will be welcome news to those households. But Amazon drivers can’t go the extra mile. They lack the civic responsibilities of government workers, and their routesfluctuatealgorithmically, meaning it’s harder to build community ties.What’s more, Amazon’s last-mile network will expand only as long as it’s profitable to do so. “I don’t see it going into the mule train business, right?” said Christopher W Shaw, author of First Class: TheUS Postal Service, Democracy, and the Corporate Threat. An Amazon driver will never sing the USPS’s unofficial motto: “Every piece, every address, every day.” Without a legal mandate, why would they?As one Minnesota town-hall clerk put it in the 1970s: “The post office is like drinking water.

As I write this, Israel israzingGaza City to the ground in the latest stage of what many respected international human rights organizations and scholars have called a genocide. There aren’t as many images coming out of Gaza City as there should be because the Israeli military is still not allowing foreign reporters free access to Gaza and has murdered many of the journalists in the ground. In August, Al Jazeera’s team in Gaza City were deliberatelytargetedby Israel.‘If these words reach you … Israel has succeeded in killing me’: the last words of a journalist killed in GazaRead moreNature abhors a vacuum, but propagandists love it. As Gaza burns and information coming out of the strip is deliberately limited, highly paid marketers and PR people in multinational firms are busy rewriting history in real time. Earlier this month, Drop Site News, which has done essential work on Gaza,reported thatan American polling firm called Stagwell Global, founded by Mark Penn, was commissioned by Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs to rehabilitate Israel’s global image. Penn, for the uninitiated, is a pollster who facilitatedBill Clinton’s re-election in 1996 and then helpedHillary Clintonlose toBarack Obamain the 2008 primaries with a combination of hubris and racist stereotyping. “The right knows Obama is unelectable except perhaps against Attila the Hun,” Penn wrote in aClinton campaign memo. He also proposed characterizing Obamaas un-American. (Stagwelltold Adweekthe work in Israel was run by a “small team” and that its agencies work “across the political and issue spectrum”. Last week, a spokespersontold PRWeekthe work was a “defined project with a specific brief” that had now concluded.)Per Drop Site, the report from Penn’s firm apparently assessed that Israel has a good chance of making people forget about that nasty little genocide business if they stoke fear of “Radical Islam” and “Jihadism”. “Especially once the situation in Gaza is resolved, the room for growth in all countries [when it comes to Israel’s image] is very significant,” the report concludes. If you make people scared that babies are terrorists then they won’t mind when you murder them, basically. You can see the whole reporthere. (After you’ve read that, I recommend reading the newlegal analysisfrom a UN commission which accuses Israel of committing genocide. Here’s asnippet: “Israeli security forces shot at and killed civilians, including children who were holding makeshift white flags. Some children, including toddlers, were shot in the head by snipers.”)Once marketing firms have got their genocide-denial talking points ready to go, they need bots to help spread them. It wasreported by Sludge News last weekthat SKDKnickerbocker LLC, which is owned by Stagwell Global, signed a$600,000 contractto run a “bot-based program” to amplify pro-Israel narratives on Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube and other platforms. SKDK, which was co-founded by the longtime Joe Biden adviser Anita Dunn andregisteredas a foreign agent for Israel earlier this year, described a strategy to “flood the zone” with pro-Israel messaging.It’s not clear how much the zone has already been flooded but, last week, Politicoreportedthat SKDK has supposedly stopped its work with Israel and “begun the process of de-registering” as a foreign agent. SKDK and Stagwell also both said they did not work on a bot initiative, just “media relations”.The propaganda isn’t just changing minds – it’s breaking the mechanisms people use to process moral informationZoe ScamanPro-Israel propaganda campaigns are already working, saysZoe Scaman, a marketing expert who has been outspoken about Stagwell’s work. “The ‘flooding the zone’ strategy works because it doesn’t need to convince people genocide is good, it just needs to make them uncertain about what they’re seeing or tired of thinking about,” Scaman told me. “Look how successfully opposition to child killing has been made to seem like extremism. The propaganda isn’t just changing minds – it’s breaking the mechanisms people use to process moral information. When reality itself becomes contested territory, systematic killing becomes just another political disagreement.”Stagwell’s work, it should be stressed, is just one small part of Israel’s genocide-rebranding efforts. Last yearthe Times of Israel reportedthat the country’s foreign ministry was getting an additional $150m (£115m) to shape public opinion. Per the Times, the increasedhasbarabudget “would be used to influence sentiment in the foreign press and on social media”.That budget seems a little over the top because it’s been made clear that Israel doesn’t have to do much in order for a lot of the US media and political class to push its messaging. Hamas committed verified atrocities on 7 October, but one of the key talking points that helped manufacture consent for the genocide was the (now thoroughlydebunked) lie that they beheaded 40 babies. Normally journalists and politicians would fact-check such an inflammatory claim before disseminating it. Certainly, if a Palestinian media outlet made a claim like this, it would have to be triple-checked before anyone published it – even then it would probably go under the “opinion” section. But the beheaded babies lie was widely repeated by the likes of Joe Biden and CNN reporter Sara Sidner.While Sidner has nowapologizedfor not being careful with her words and the White Housewalked back Biden’s comments, other journalists haven’t done the same. The CBS News senior correspondent Norah O’Donnellstill has a tweetup from 10 October stating: “@CBSNewslearned that Israel body recovery teams have discovered beheaded babies and children in kibbutzim in southern Israel.” I emailed CBS News’s communication team to ask why they were continuing to perpetuate this misinformation and never heard back.Israel is wiping out Gaza’s journalists – and it’s no longer even hiding it | Jodi GinsbergRead moreCBS News is owned by Paramount Global, which has not been shy about its position as a cheerleader for Israel. Paramount is in theprocessof acquiring Bari Weiss’s Free Press, which has consistentlydownplayedthe genocide in Gaza and provided unapologetic support for Israel, for between $100m to $200m. Weiss will alsoreportedlybe tasked with “guiding the editorial direction of the [CBS news] division”. According to theFinancial Times, Weiss partly won over CBS owner David Ellison “by taking a pro-Israel stance”.David Ellison is the son ofLarry Ellison, a tycoon who oversees the technology company Oracle anddonated $16.6mto Friends of the Israel Defense Forces (FIDF) in 2017, the largest single gift in FIDF’s history. Oracle is currently among a consortium of firms that is looking to take over TikTok. If this happens, one imagines that TikTok’s algorithm may well get a more pro-Israel bent. One of the reasons that TikTok was put up for sale in the first place is because a lot of US lawmakers wereupsetwith pro-Palestinian messaging on the platform. Indeed,Mitt Romneyexplicitly referencedthe issuein relation to the “overwhelming support” to shut TikTok down. It becomes much easier to “flood the zone” with propaganda when you control the zone.It’s not just media outlets working overtime to help rehabilitate Israel’s image: if you’re American, it’s likely your elected representatives are too. Two hundred and fiftyAmerican state legislatorsjust traveled to Israel for the50 States, One Israelconference. I don’t know about you, but I’d far rather my representatives were doing something about public schools and healthcare in the US, instead of going on propaganda jaunts abroad.“One day, when it’s safe, when there’s no personal downside to calling a thing what it is, when it’s too late to hold anyone accountable, everyone will have always been against this,” the writer Omer El Akkad said in late October 2023, of the unfolding genocide inGaza. That quote, now the title of a book, went viral because it articulated what so many of us are desperate to believe: that while we may not see justice right now, one day the truth will out. One day there will be some sort of accountability. But while it’s important not to lose hope, I’m gradually finding it hard to maintain the optimism that one day everyone will always have been against this. It is looking far more likely that one day a lot of money will have been spent to rebrand this.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warCBScommentShareReuse this content"

These days, that number has soared to one in five.For young adults, those figures are much higher, with almost half of adults under 30 getting news there, according to thePew Research Center.But who will own that hugely influential purveyor of information?As with so much of American media – from television networks to some of the largest newspapers – the answer is shaping up to be as simple and short as a TikTok video: the ultra-rich.As President Trumpmoved this weekto clear the path to sell the platform’s US assets to a group of American investors, the metastasizing reality of media-by-oligarchy threatened to become even more extreme.One of those investors is the billionaire and Trump donor Larry Ellison, whose son’s media company owns CBS News and is reportedlyplanning a bid for Warner Bros Discovery, which in turn owns CNN. Another reportedly isRupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, with rightwing bona fides well-known through their control of Fox News.The former US labor secretaryRobert Reich describedthe situation plainly, writing this week on the platform formerly known as Twitter: “The richest man on earth owns X. The second richest man on earth is about to be a major owner of TikTok. The third richest man owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The fourth richest man owns the Washington Post.”He was talking, of course, about Musk, Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos.We’ve already seen some of what happens when billionaires control the media – and remain committed to getting even richer and more powerful.Bezos has dramatically turned the Washington Post opinion section to the right, as he curries favor with Trump. TheAmazon co-founder killed a draft endorsement of Kamala Harrislast fall, and later installed an opinion editor who has driven out some of the Post’s most esteemed journalists.Another newspaper-owning billionaire, Patrick Soon-Shiong, has changed the tenor of the opinion offerings at his newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, as he too cozies up to Trump.It’s not just rich individuals controlling major media companies. Even local newspapers are largely – and increasingly – owned by big chains, rather than the local families who once had a stake in the communities their papers served.It’s a story of media consolidation, power and money.ABC News is controlled by Disney, hence the recent decisions tosettle a winnable defamation suitbrought by Trump and tosuspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmelafter his on-air remarks after the murder of far-right provocateur Charlie Kirk.With TikTok, one of the biggest questions is control of the all-important algorithm, which determines what consumers experience when they use the platform.The deal is not done, and it has lots of moving parts.No executive order by Trump can complete it, since the likely plan would spin off a US version of the platform from TikTok’s China-based version, owned by ByteDance. Chinese officials would still need to agree.But the pieces are in place.“It’s incredibly troubling how quickly media moguls are capturing the information space at a time when there’s a crackdown on speech more broadly,” Emma Briant of Notre Dame Universitytoldthe Washington Post. As she sees it, they are “grabbing and seeking to control more and more of the infrastructure through which political debate happens”.Or, increasingly, through which political debatedoesn’thappen. While self-censorship is hard to measure, such ownership moves can encourage decision-makers inside these influential companies to pull their punches instead of reporting without fear or favor.I have serious doubts about whether TikTok’s brief videos, intended for viral sharing, are an ideal way to get news across to the public. The format doesn’t bring tremendous nuance or context, qualities already in short supply.But TikTok is wildly popular and influential, and – in this era of ever shorter attention spans – on the rise. It matters.The White House has claimed that the new uber-rich American investors in TikTok are patriots who love America.But we also know what else they love. It’s something that comes not in red, white and blue but a familiar shade of green.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsTikTokOpinionThe super-richSocial mediaChinaDonald TrumpUS press and publishingcommentShareReuse this content"

Finally, the prime minister would spell out the progressive, patriotic answer to a summer of far-right hate, culminating in Elon Musk’s bloodcurdlingdeclaration that “violence is coming”to the streets of Britain. Yet for all its talk of renewal and confronting the politics of grievance,Friday’s speech– a warmup for what will be a longer argument at Labour’s forthcoming party conference – still sounded oddly like a surrender to Reform’s theory of where it all supposedly went wrong.Both New Labour and their Tory successors were too relaxed about legal immigration, Starmer suggested, and the left in particular has shied away from the argument about controlling Britain’s borders. To stop those with no right to be in the country from supposedly undercutting wages by working in the black market, everyone must now carry digital ID on their smartphones and show it when starting a job. Think Theresa May’s hostile environment, only this time in your pocket.Identity cards are not a new or even particularly radical idea. They’re widely accepted in Europe – French politicians have long argued that a British equivalent could help cut small boat crossings, if they made it harder for people smugglers to promise a job on arrival – and Tony Blair came close to introducing them as prime minister, though he billed them more as a means of easily accessing public services than a punitive measure. But it’s the meteoric rise of Reform UK that makes such measures both more attractive to a Labour government desperate for something to say on immigration, and arguably more risky. If this plan to beat the right by offering authoritarianism fails, then any new power this government acquires in the process would most likely fall into the hands of a Reform government at the next election, free to use it for very different ends. Suddenly, this is a gamble of very high stakes indeed.Though Britons wouldn’t have to produce their IDs when stopped on the street under Starmer’s plans, a future administration could easily change that. Just imagine how useful ID cards would be inrounding people upfor Trump-style mass deportations – especially if that effort was linked to facial recognition technology already in use by the British police, creating a system capable of automatically scanning crowds anywhere from a rush-hour Tube station to a football match and matching faces against an immigration database. (There are remarkably few legal constraints on how exactly facial recognition can be used, compared to other technologies like fingerprinting or DNA when they were introduced). Suddenly, there would be nowhere to hide. Now imagine how some future regime could potentially use such tools, perhaps not just against visa overstayers but anyone deemed an enemy of the state.Too paranoid? Maybe. It’s still far from clear that Reform can win in 2029, let alone how an instinctively libertarian party (it’s officially opposed to compulsory ID cards) would react to the powers falling into its lap. What is clear, however, is just how fast the tide is running.Less than a year ago, Nigel Farage was still insisting that Trump-style mass deportations couldn’t happen in Britain. Now, under pressure from rivals to his own right, he isthreatening to round up migrantsin their hundreds of thousands and make settled migrants with indefinite leave to remain – people whose right to be here was never previously in doubt – reapply for the right to stay. What’s frightening isn’t just how fast things are escalating but how little there is to stop them escalating further, with old norms visibly crumbling and mainstream parties in flapping disarray.Civil libertarians have long warned against handing powers to benign-seeming regimes without considering how a malign one might later use them, only to be dismissed as paranoid. Even now, a part of me feels faintly ridiculous, discussing what Big Brother Watch’s Silkie Carlo calls the “architecture of authoritarianism” – a raft of policing, security and civil powers accumulated mostly in order to combat crime – might in future be used for more sinisterly repressive purposes. Britain isn’t America, even now. But watching Donald Trump bulldoze through a written constitution makes it impossible not to wonder how Britain, with its more higgledy-piggledy ad hoc constitution, would resist an outright populist attack on its democratic institutions.Imagine a new government that moved immediately to scrap both the BBC licence fee – effectively kneecapping public service broadcasting – and the online harms bill that restrains social media’s worst excesses, while vowing to rewrite laws on hate speech it considers repressive. Mainstream politicians have floated each of those ideas in the past, so each could be presented as perfectly reasonable. But combined with Trumpian attacks on journalists considered hostile, they could swiftly add up to the chilling of the free press and an explosion of fake news online.Suppose it then announced plans to get a grip on the criminal justice system, accusing “woke” police and judges of letting ethnic minority offenders off too lightly. Chief constables who fought to defend their operational independence could easily find, as the Met’s Cressida Dick did after Sarah Everard’s murder, that governments cheered on by friendly tabloids have ways of making their lives impossible.Citizen protests against all this could easily be repressed, using measures originallyintended for activist groups like Just Stop Oil. If the House of Lords pushed back, the new government could either threaten to shrink it as Reform did in its last manifesto, or resort (as the legal blogger David Allen Green haspointed out) to more devious means, like legislating via secondary instruments that don’t require a full parliamentary vote. In this scenario, what stops Britain’s slide into something genuinely dystopian?It’s true that the famously freedom-loving Farage makes an unlikely candidate for full-fat authoritarianism, with Reform supporters if anything even more wary of big state power. But the same was once true of the Trump faithful, which hasn’t stopped himsending the National Guardinto Democrat-controlled cities. It’s surprising how many libertarians harbour deeply authoritarian instincts, just so long as it’s the other side’s freedoms being curtailed.Perhaps you think all this is hysterically overwrought, the kind of liberal handwringing that invariably cripples leftwing governments. But at the very least, the stronger and more centralised techno-stateKeir Starmerseems to envisage as the answer to the nation’s problems is a new direction for Britain and one that demands safeguards. It’s one thing building a powerful machine to destroy your enemy. It’s quite another doing so knowing that very shortly you may be handing them the keys.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s when he said he wanted the next election to be an “open fight” between “Labour and Reform”. In the speech itself, however, he identified his enemies in the abstract. He was against the “politics of predatory grievance”, which used the “infrastructure of division”. He also made a lovely case for London at the start, with its plentiful pubs and pleasant parks, remarking wryly that it was nothing like “the wasteland of anarchy that some would have you believe”.The problem is he needs to pick a lane. Either he was referring to Donald Trump’s comments at the UN earlier this week, when the leader of the free worldsaid Britain’s capitalhad a “terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it’s been changed, it’s been so changed. Now they want to go to sharia law”, in which case Starmer should say so. Or he was attempting to describe the ascendant hard right upturning our politics without identifying or reflecting upon its main mouthpieces, in which case, what the hell is he thinking?One issue is that you very often cannot tell what the prime minister is thinking, so camouflaged is any thought under the buzzwords of the day. “Patriotic renewal” is today’s invention, which could mean anything from bunging some cash to a community centre to becoming a clean-energy superpower. If you ever feel dispirited by this pabulum, just be thankful you weren’t in whatever meeting it was probably dreamed up in at the Tony Blair Institute.A far larger problem is the substance of Starmer’s fight with Reform. The most concrete announcement he made was that ofdigital ID cards, which will be mandatory for anyone trying to work in the UK. (It wasn’t in Labour’s 2024 manifesto, there are certainly people who wouldn’t have voted Labour had it been, but worrying about things like that feels very 20th century.) He explicitly proffered ID cards as a solution to illegal immigration. “It has been too easy for people to come here [and] slip into the shadow economy,” Starmer said. “We’ve been squeamish about saying things that are clearly true … the simple fact is that every nation needs to have control over its borders … our immigration system does need to be fair, otherwise it undermines trust, undermines people’s faith that we’re on their side.”By his own words, then, he condemns his intelligence: if migrants are in the shadow economy, how are ID requirements in the regular economy supposed to deter them? It’s almost as though that’s not the question he’s trying to answer. What’s really going on is an attempt to echo the anti-migrant passions of Reform, while simultaneously coming up with solutions that don’t sound fanciful. Starmer’s animating question at the moment is this: how can he appeal to those who love authoritarianism while not alienating those who hate it?To revive Labour, Starmer should go to conference with this pledge: we will clean politics of sleaze | Polly ToynbeeRead moreGreen energy was the other front of Starmer’s “fightback”, and he talked a decent game on renewables – first decrying Vladimir Putin’s boot on our neck, then promising nuclear, wind and solar energy, which would create jobs, drive down prices and address the climate crisis. We could cavil about the prominence of nuclear there, but the essence is fine. It broadly reiterates the promises made when Green New Deal was the buzz phrase, even if the surrounding emphasis on growth above all and fiscal responsibility hints that the ambition has been scaled right back.Realistically, though, the speed at which thisLabourgovernment has rolled over on the issue of immigration and asylum seekers – accepting Reform’s insistence upon its salience, failing to make the positive case for migration – makes you wonder how long its green credentials will last, once the right has them in its crosshairs. Will Starmer’s green promises survive until Nigel Farage starts a new campaign to end net zero? Or will he start to falter as soon as Kemi Badenoch promises to bring down everyone’s energy bills with the dregs of the North Sea?It’s a well-established feature, arguably the main feature, of any era where the hard right is on the march: elites make common cause with the masses, by means of an out-group, often racial minorities or people who aren’t citizens, and use the hatred thus generated as the abundant energy source for the movement. Our prime minister identified, in vague terms, a “cynical attempt to exploit [working class] fears” and kept himself above the fray, when in fact he is critical to the fray. He’s the poster boy of the ineffectual liberal who watches the world swerve to the right and tries to appease it with some light or, if you prefer, diet xenophobia. If we’re now talking about an “open fight” between Labour and Reform, let’s be open about this: he will not beat them by becoming more like them.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourReform UKImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

People expect corrupting cash from the Tories, with their last cabinet of zillionaires umbilically linked to finance of every kind, but voters expect better from Labour. The first painful dent in the moral armour of Keir Starmer’s cabinet was the revelation offreebies he and others acceptedin clothes, glasses and tickets. There was a chance then to get on the front foot, using that minor but shabby embarrassment to declare a great clean-up of the sewage inflow of influence on politics from mega donations. But No 10 missed it.The dispute over Labour’s alleged failure to declaresizeable supportfrom the campaign group Labour Together offers another opportunity for Starmer to call time on big money in politics. TheTories have called for the electoral commission toconduct a new investigationinto this week’s allegations – including that Labour failed to declare staffing costs it received from Labour Together that covered McSweeney’s salary. In 2021, the watchdogfined Labour Together £14,250for failing to properly declare sizeable donations, which the campaign group blamed on an “administrative error”. Labour has clarified this week thatMcSweeney’s salarywas paid by Starmer’s leadership campaign in 2020, not Labour Together.But that’s not the point. Few will follow tortuous points of law. Every time people are reminded of eye-watering sums swashing about in our politics, they rightly think it stinks. And it does, even when all the rules are followed. There’s no way of knowing what, if any, influence donations have, but the public understandably assumes that some donors expect something in return. Even if they asked for nothing in return, why should the preferences of the wealthy swing our elections?Cash for honours has contaminated parliament since the dawn of time. “Dark money” finds loopholes in the law. According to analysis last year, almost £1 in every £10 donated to parties and politicians comes fromunknown or dubious sources: cash from companies that have never turned a profit, from unincorporated associations that do not have to declare their funders and banned donations from overseas donors via intermediaries, enters the system.A£75,000 donationto Robert Jenrick was mired in controversy after it was revealed that the donation was given by a company that financed it through a loan from a business registered in the Virgin Islands (Jenrick said the donation was “perfectly legal and valid”). But never mind what’s hidden when broad daylight is no disinfectant to the influence wielded by a rich minority. Between 2001 and 2021, a fifth of all donations to UK political parties came fromjust 10 big donors. While cash for honours is illegal, wealthy Conservative benefactors who donatemore than £3m to the partyhave found themselves getting seats in the House of Lords.The fright of Elon Musk’s rumoured threat todonate $100m (£78m)to Reformshould be enough to jolt the government into action. Musk can legally do this via the profits from his UK company. There is nothing to prevent a single man abroad from nearly doubling the total donations to UK political parties, which stood at£100m in 2024. The Committee on Standards in Public Life haspreviously calledfor an annual donation cap of £10,000 for individuals and organisations, covering expat donors too. The cash that flows in from them needs to be registered: currently, as Justin Fisher writes inPolitical Quarterly, there is no data available on how much they donate.Capping all donations to £10,000 would require state funding to fill the gap. Party membership fees will never cover what parties need to run headquarters and public meetings, recruit policy researchers, administrators, local organisers for elections and selections, conferences, leaflets and social media. Democracy relies on party volunteers, but they need professional organisers, too. Taxpayers may not like it, but put the choice to people straight: would you rather a small subvention from the state of around £100m, or in this time of power-crazed mega masters of the world’s wealth, will you leave it to the likes of Musk to buy up political parties as they buy up everything else? Few people think democracy should be up for sale, which is why a majority of the publicsupports a cap on party donations. That £100m is a tiny price to pay for politics uncontaminated by cash.Labour’s reliance on trade union funds need be no block on reform. Making all donations personal, not institutional, wouldn’t break the fundamental link between Labour and the unions that created the party. Ending unsavoury threats by unions to defund Labour would be cleansing for both. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, Labour’s biggest single donor, does her union, unions in general and the Labour party no favours when, like an old family matriarch, shethreatens to cut fundingto the party when it displeases her. Labour’s far-reaching workers’ rights bill is constantly slandered by the right as payback for union funds: it isn’t. It’s strongly supported by cabinet, party, and above all the public – but the sniff of “union paymasters” harms one of the government’s best policies.Canada limits yearly donations to $3,450 per voter. The rest of the bill is picked up by the state, which pays for 62% of the cost of running parties. That’s what clean politics looks like (though even on that low limit,campaigners protestthat donations are too swayed by the wealthy). Labour should take heed. If it makes a clean break, and goes with the grain of public opinion, it might begin to dispel public disgust with politicians wooing the rich.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We all know how that panned outFri 26 Sep 2025 08.37 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShare“Whenever Westminster has gone into a moment,”Andy Burnham lamentedin one of his many interviews this week, “I have somehow been drawn into it.” Yeah, we’re alltrying to find the guywho did this. Why is this happening to Andy Burnham, this fevered speculation that Labour’s Iron Throne has his name on it, which is nowcausing cabinet ministers, the prime minister and maybe even thebond marketsto overtly or covertly slag him off? “I think what we’ve got to do,” Andy thought in another interview, “is to stop the sense in Westminster at times that everything is in flux.” Counterpoint: the sense in Westminster is that everything is completely and utterly fluxed. The wider country is considerably less optimistic.Yet is Andy Burnham the answer? The Greater Manchester mayor would certainly appear to reckon so, having worked tirelessly this week to give himself pre-title billing at his party’s imminent gathering in Liverpool. Yup, here he comes – the King of the North, the cock of the conference, the memoji of Manchester – as unafraid to chat shit to those bond markets as he was togive that press conferencein that jacket in that pandemic. The worry is that Andy is just one of those things that, during Covid, people thought were very good, but now realise are actually very bad. Like incipient alcoholism or Ted Lasso.Maybe Burnham is less bad than Keir Starmer, which isn’t exactly the Kitemark, but also not the same as having a plan. Certainly, nobody is as bad as Britain’s problems, which is the main light flashing on the dashboard, and none of Burnham’s proposals thus far – some nationalisation and some wealth taxes – touch the sides of them.In fairness, he’s not offering a policy platform at this stage, the stage where he’s implying he wants to be prime minister, not how he wants to be prime minister. It’s more of a vibe – if not to all tastes within the parliamentary Labour party. Consider the MP whotold HuffPost: “Keir should say to him, ‘Any time you want, Andy, there’ll be a seat for you, and I want you in government.’ He’d shit himself. People would see how useless he is.” Housing secretary Steve Reed is another one who seems somehow unkeen on Andy making a conference entrance like theNorth Face Kylo Ren, describing Burnham as a “regional politician”, and warning against the risk of division. Risk division at this upcoming Labour conference? No spoilers, but it’s just possible we might have passed that particular event horizon.Disappointing interjections like these seem to have been part of what sent Burnham back to the microphone: “I gave an honest answer and sometimes it feels to me that the Westminster world can’t deal with those answers.” Yeah, they can’t handle his truth. This is the Westminster world in which Burnham previously served loyally as a Blairite, a Brownite, a Corbynite and even a Starmerite, but he’d like you to know he’s been a long time out of that … swamp, would you call it? Certainly the insult “Westminster” is recurring increasingly often in Burnham’s pitch. I can’t bear the thought of him finding out where he’s going to have to work if his dream comes true.Then again, despite the week bringing this new drama, it’s hard for anyone who has lived through the past decade of political turmoil in the UK not to feel there are at least familiar elements here. Having extracted my memories of the 2017 and 2018 Conservative party conferences from the coffin of earth I’d nailed them into, I am transported back to those times when some guy made both events absolutely all about him and his will-he-won’t-he leadership bid. As you might recall, the guy was Boris Johnson, fannying about like the blancmange Uncle Scar, driving half the attenders mad with political lust and the other half just mad. The then Henley MP John Howell spoke for a significant chunk of his colleagues at the 2017 Tory conference when he said: “My message to Boris is to keep his bloody mouth shut.” By the 2018 conference, many had become so openly weary of the Johnson manoeuvring thatHowell ramped up to: “As far as I’m concerned, Boris can just fuck off.” In the 2019 Conservative leadership contest John Howell would vote – obviously, obviously – for Boris Johnson. Henley is currently represented by the Liberal Democrats.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We either get inadequate chancers (eg Johnson or Liz Truss) or chance inadequates (eg Theresa May, Rishi Sunak or Keir Starmer), all of whom are forever being presented as the next true hope. We last drew one off the chance-inadequates pile, so maybe next time round it’s fated to be an inadequate chancer – a casting call Nigel Farage could definitely nail.Andy Burnham belongs to the other pile, I think. But after the past week, and forgive this dip into Premier League history books, I now find it impossible to hear him giving it the full King of the North without thinking of Alex Ferguson’s dismissal of Paul Ince as a “big time Charlie”. Alas, some associative synaptic glitch means I now cannot hear the words “King of the North” without my brain changing them into “the Guv’nor” – a nickname that Ince bestowed upon himself, admittedly, while Andy’s was fitted to him by the media. And you know, Ince was probably underrated – don’t write in – so maybe that bodes well …Even so, I did feel a tightening in my jaw when Andy informed the BBC this week that a tilt at the top job would need to be “more than a personality contest”. A personality contest between Keir Starmer andAndy Burnham?

Labour voters feel betrayed; anti-immigration voters see through the ruseFri 26 Sep 2025 06.59 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 12.08 EDTShareAs the Labour party gathers in Liverpool this weekend for its annual conference, everyone will be discussing one word: Reform. Nigel Farage’s party ispolling nationallyaround 13 points ahead of the Conservatives and 10 points ahead of Labour. Even in Merseyside, whose 16 constituencies used to be Labour safe seats, the party no longer seems assured. The government’s strategy for dealing with this has so far been shaped by an overwhelmingly flawed instinct: if Farage’s latest party is winning votes by talking tough on immigration, then Labour should shift rightwards too.Starmer’s “island of strangers” speechearlier this yearmarked a dramatic turn to the right on immigration. That infamous moment marked the publication of a government white paper that promised to clamp down on net migration, and blamed immigrants for overstretching public services – ignoring how chronic disinvestment has left many of those services threadbare. Farage could barely contain his delight at Labour’s new strategy. Hecongratulated Starmerfor “learning a great deal” from Reform UK. Imitation really is the greatest form of flattery.Labour is not alone in this. Across Europe, the left has repeatedly responded to the radical right byechoing their rhetoricon immigration. In Germany, the previous coalition government, led by Social Democrat Olaf Scholz as chancellor, sharply changed its rhetoric and policies on immigration and asylum as it attempted to see off Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). In the February 2025 election, the Social Democratic party received their historically worst result, securing just 16.4% of the vote, while the AfD did better than ever before, with 20.8% – an increase of more than 10% compared with the last election in 2021.As political scientists, we’ve spent years investigating what happens when mainstream parties “get tough” on immigration, and how this affects support for the radical right. Werecently studiedwhat happened to people’s assessment of Labour, and their likelihood of voting for the party or Reform, shortly after Starmer gave his island of strangers speech. The speech helpfully coincided with a period when people were answering a survey for theBritish Election Study, so we gathered responses from people who were interviewed immediately before the speech, and those interviewed immediately after. The results: the speech made Labour and Starmerlesspopular, especially among Labour’s own voters. It significantly boosted immigration as an issue in people’s minds. There is no evidence it helped to reduce support for Reform, or convince Reform voters that they should vote Labour.Recent research from Persuasion UK, a nonprofit, told much the same story. It found that Labour’smessaging around deportationsstrengthened the importance of the issue while potentiallystrengthening Reform. This is hardly unique to Labour.We studiedmore than 70 different electionsthat took place in 12 western European countries over several decades,and found that when mainstream parties take more anti-immigration positions, itleads tomoresupportfor the radical right, not less. We’vealso foundthat when social democratic parties propose strongly reducing immigration numbers, this leads to less support for social democratic parties at the ballot box.When progressive parties imitate the right, they weaken their own electoral prospects.The picture that emerges from this research is clear: moving right on immigration doesn’t helpLabour. It alienates Labour’s progressive base and fails to win over Reform voters. When Labour defines itself as a party happy to mimic those who scapegoat migrants, liberally minded voters feel betrayed. Many decide that they can no longer vote for the party. Even under first past the post, these voters will move to another party such as the Greens, or stay at home on election day.At the same time, anti-immigration voters see Labour’s pivot as inauthentic mimicry. Many of them don’t even register Labour’s rightwards shift, since Labour doesn’t fall in their list of parties that might win their vote. For them, if immigration is the defining issue, Reform or the Conservatives will always be the more credible option, no matter what Labour do.In the short term, presenting Labour as a party that’s tough on immigration is a vote-losing strategy. In the long term, it may even have the opposite effect of bolstering the success of the very party Labour seeks to outmanoeuvre. When radical-right words come from Labour mouths, the nativist and illiberal values attached to these words become increasingly normalised, shifting the boundaries of what is politically acceptable.Copying the radical right is electorally self-defeating. Social democratic parties that try this route lose their own supporters without gaining new ones, and help to legitimise their opponents in the process. It’s time for Labour to engage in some self-reflection about the type of party it wants to be. At the moment it operates as if advancing a progressive agenda and being in government are mutually exclusive. That is far from the case. It can’t beat the radical right by becoming a pale imitation of it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As its conference begins in Liverpool this weekend,the party must ask itself whether the political culture it is building is one that can inspire a country, or merely discipline it into compliance. Without a shift towards democracy, discussion and pluralism, Labour risks forfeiting the very moral and political authority it needs to confront the authoritarian voices shouting so loudly beyond our own ranks, and increasingly within them.The Corbyn wavethat swept Labour in 2015was more than just a political surge. It was a redefinition of the possible, a moment when grassroots activism, radical ideas and the audacity of political hope took centre stage. It represented a demand for genuine democracy, pluralism and change. For many, it was the first time in living memory that Labour had felt like a movement rather than a machine. Today, Starmer’s absolute determination to distance Labour from that era speaks volumes.The currentparty leadership views unity not as something cultivated through respectful dialogue and diverse perspectives, but something enforced through control. The Corbyn moment threatenedLabourprecisely because it signalled a party potentially ungovernable by conventional managerial methods. This is a party unsure how to reconcile democratic participation with electoral success.Parliamentary candidate selections have been increasingly centralised, and grassroots members and leftwing voices within the party marginalised. A party once brimming with energy, ideas and volunteers has become a professionalised bureaucracy aimed at maintaining power rather than transforming society.If Keir Starmer’s Labour can’t satisfy the unions, another party will | Andy BeckettRead moreLabour’s aversion to pluralism is most obvious in its rejection of coalition politics. It wants to be an electoral juggernaut capable of winning alone or not at all. Yet contemporary crises – climate breakdown, authoritarian populism, stark economic inequality – demand cooperation beyond narrow party lines. Collaboration between Labour, the Greens, the Liberal Democrats and other progressive forces is not a sign of weakness, but maturity. And the stakes are as high as the very future of our democracy, our planet. Such a refusal to share power becomes not just strategically foolish, but morally questionable.Nowhere is Labour’s aversion to transformative politics clearer than in its avoidance of public ownership. Consider water. Publicopinion consistently favours renationalisation– not as nostalgia, but as a pragmatic response to corporate failures, ecological crises and profound erosion of trust in privatised utilities. Refusing public ownership signals abandonment of democratic control over our collective future, showing Labour’s alignment with a neoliberal orthodoxy that has repeatedly failed.This alignment finds its starkest symbol in the party’s embrace of corporate influence. This undermines democracy itself by nourishing popular cynicism. When voters seepoliticians cosying upto the same firms thatprofited from the 2008 crash, the social contract frays further.Labour’s timidity on the climate emergency underscores this problem further. This defining crisis of our times demands bold, courageous and imaginative responses. Yet Labour’s approach has been cautious and timid, perpetually afraid of alienating swing voters or corporate backers. Net zero is framed only in terms of competitiveness, not adaptation and survival. Green investment is promised, but always secondary to fiscal rules set by an economic consensus long past its sell-by date. While floods devastate communities and air quality worsens, Labour dithers.Part of the problem is that the party is paralysed by institutional pressures and geopolitical alignments. Of course, balancing these forces is what makes for great governments and leaders. But Starmer has shown no such inclination. As prime minister, he faces substantial constraints, particularly regarding established alliances such as those with the US. Buthis careful neutrality over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and quietacquiescence to harsh immigration policiesreflect an inclination toward diplomatic continuity rather than ethical clarity or moral leadership.In this vacuum, the populist right seizes ground, offering nativist, nationalist solutions to problems that demand internationalist, ecological and equitable solidarity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not because the current Labour leadership inspires it, but in spite of it. Hope survives in the growing networks of community organisers, cooperative movements, union branches, citizen assemblies and environmental campaigns. It flourishes in places ignored by Westminster – municipal projects reclaiming public land, local councils experimenting withparticipatory budgeting, workersorganising in Amazon warehousesandUber ranks. These spaces show that politics is not the property of party elites, but of people acting in concert to change their lives.Ultimately, Starmerism risks rendering Labour unfit for the purpose it was created for: to give apolitical voice to working people and deliver collective solutions to collective problems. Openly addressing this is essential for Labour – and British politics broadly.The crisis is real, yet so too is thepotential for renewal. But that renewal cannot come from above. It must come from below – from a revitalised political culture that sees people not as voters to be harvested, but as citizens to be empowered. Recognising this is the first critical step toward a politics daring enough to imagine and urgently act upon the challenges we collectively face. And if this moment is indeed one of endings, then let it also be a moment of beginnings – a time to organise, to imagine and to build anew.Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich South.

In place of the single emergency call system that worked in the period before privatisation and liberalisation, we now have multiple networks, which are supposed to connect their calls to Telstra. Optus lobbying earlier this year successfullydelayed a proposal(introduced in response to an earlier outage in 2023) for real-time information sharing on such outages.Instead, calls reporting the most recent failure weredirected to offshore call centres, where the operators failed to “escalate” them properly. The days-long delays in working out the extent of the problem reflect a corporate culture where triple zero calls are seen as an inconvenient cost burden rather than a vital community service. It’s the same culture that has seenOptus fined heavilyfor misleading consumers.But until the recent spate of failures, telecommunications was seen as one of the increasingly rare sectors where privatisation and competition had produced improved outcomes for consumers. During the era of neoliberalism, the cost of telecommunications has plummeted, while the range of services has expanded massively. Whereas an international phone call cost more than a dollar a minute when telecoms were deregulated in the 1990s, they now cost only a cent or two per minute even on those plans that don’t include unlimited calls. As a result, telecommunications is regularly cited as an area where neoliberal reform has been successful.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA closer look at the record tells a different story. Technological progress in telecommunications produced a steady reduction in prices throughout the 20th century, taking place around the world and regardless of the organisational structure. The shift from analog to digital telecommunications accelerated the process. Telecom Australia, the statutory authority that became Telstra, recorded total factor productivity growth rates as high as 10% per year, remaining profitable while steadily reducing prices.Optus claimed live updates on triple-zero outages would impose ‘huge burden’ months before outageRead moreBut for the advocates of neoliberal microeconomic reform, this wasn’t enough. They hoped, or rather assumed, that competition would produce both better outcomes for consumers and a more efficient rollout of physical infrastructure.Optuswas an artificial creation of the reform process. In return for acquiring the publicly owned satellite network Aussat, Optus was given a regulatory head-start of six years, during which it was the only competitor to Telstra.The failures emerged early. Seeking to cement their positions before the advent of open competition, Telstra and Optus spent billions rolling out fibre-optic cable networks. But rather than seeking to maximise total coverage, the two networks were virtually parallel, a result that is a standard prediction of economic theory. The rollout stopped when the market was fully opened in 1997, leaving parts of urban Australia with two redundant fibre networks and the rest of the country with none.The next failure came with the rollout of broadband. Under public ownership, this would have been a relatively straightforward matter. But the newly privatised Telstra played hardball, demanding a system that would cement its monopoly position in fixed-line infrastructure. The end result was the need to return to public ownership with the national broadband network, while paying Telstra handsomely for access to ducts and wires that the public had owned until a few years previously.Meanwhile the hoped-for competition in mobile telephony has failed to emerge. The near-duopoly created in 1991, with Telstra as the dominant player and Optus playing second fiddle, has endured for more than 30 years. The 2020 decision to allow a merger between the remaining serious competitors, TPG and Vodafone, was an effective admission that no more than three firms could survive. Unsurprisingly, prices have increased significantly since then.And in crucial respects, three will soon become two. Optus and TPG now share their regional networks, a recognition of the fact that telecommunications infrastructure is a natural monopoly, and that the idea of “facilities-based competition” is an absurdity. If we are to have competition, the best model is that of the NBN. That is, a single wholesale “common carrier”, which allows retailers using its network to compete for customers.But as we’ve learned with privatised electricity distribution businesses, privately owned monopolies are always looking for ways to increase profits at the expense of consumers. Regulation has proved ineffective, a fact that is unsurprising given the massive imbalance of resources between regulators and the companies they oversee.The likely outcome of the triple zero disaster will be the addition of some new patches in the regulatory quilt and the ritual defenestration of some senior executives. But what we actually need is a reassessment of the whole neoliberal experiment and an acceleration of the return to public ownership of infrastructure that is already under way.John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland’s School of EconomicsExplore more on these topicsOptusOpinionBusinessTelecommunications industrycommentShareReuse this content"

The PM needs to change tack – but is he capable of it?Fri 26 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 06.34 EDTShareAlittle over a year since Labour took office in a landslide and, with the Conservatives flatlining, by any measure, Keir Starmer should be riding into next week’s party conference as, if not quite a conquering hero, a leader in his prime. Instead, he is mired intanking poll ratings,threescandalousexitsand plots by his own MPsto oust him. If the early days of Starmer’s leadership ran with such ease that it spawned the joke he must have found agenie’s lamp, it appears his wishes have well and truly run out.The idea that Labour’s return to power has been a crushing disappointment is now a well-worn one. From shirking on Gaza and crashing on benefit reform to trusting Peter Mandelson, so far, Starmer’s premiership is a lesson in lost potential, where if a poor decision can be made, it will be and then some.If it has felt at times to Starmer’s supporters over the past year that he is held to account too harshly, to others, he has unforgivably thrown away not only a precious opportunity but an obligation. You did not have to believe Starmer was going to be Britain’s saviour in July last year to hope he would at least offer some respite after a decade and a half of Tory misrule. That after the public endured austerity, Brexit and Partygate, and at last rid itself of their architects, there could actually be something better around the corner.Instead, we have been plunged into a groundhog day loop of missed chances: Starmer makes a bad call, a varying-sized chunk of the parliamentary Labour party complain, and a clique-based Downing Street operation – steered byunder firechief of staffMorgan McSweeney– dig their heels in (typically making the situation 10 times worse). Meanwhile, the reasons to elect a Labour government – say, tackling child poverty or building a humane benefits system – go largely unmet and unfulfilled. It is why the latest talk about scrapping thetwo-child benefit limitfeels empty, as we are forced yet again to play the game where a government with aworking majority of 156pretends all of this is out of its hands.This would be infuriating at any time but has become deeply worrying in light of the surge of Reform UK and wider nationalism. That Starmer will pledge at the Global Progress Action Summit on Friday that his government will lead the fight against the “decline and division” fomented by the far right – a move in stark contrast to the passivity of recent months – suggests he is at least partly aware of the urgent need to reset. But one speech will not compensate for an agenda that fails to make the positive case for immigration and asylum rights. The fact Labour will never be able to satisfy the staunch anti-immigration vote when Reform offersmass deportations(and the claim migrants areeating our swans) makes the chase more tragic still. On its worst days, Starmer’s government is akin to a mediocre tribute band playing cover versions to a crowd who will always prefer the original.It is often remarked that Starmer finds himself in trouble because he favours managerialism over a vision for the country. That’s true in a way. More than a year in, it is no clearer what Starmerism is “for”, with posturing on flags and the value of work used as a substitute for any sort of narrative. But the issue is also that, far from a break from the chaos associated with the Conservatives, Starmer’s administration has been beset by avoidable errors, inaction and crisis, all on top of the broken public realm and tough finances it inherited. Or to put it another way: basing your project around “delivery, delivery, delivery” only works if you actually deliver. Most voters don’t care about a prime minister’s lack of charisma or sweeping oratory if they canget a GP appointmentand pay the weekly food shop.

It should finally be abolished | Richard HellerRead moreThe public might be inclined to be more patient if the early signs from Starmer were trustworthy and consistent. After all, no one can overturn 15 years of Tory decline in 15 months. But, after his first year in office, few voters would say they know who their prime minister is, and what they do see seems inauthentic. The son of a toolmaker who is a knight of the realm. The human rights barrister who acts tough on asylum seekers. Add in his chameleon behaviour on policy and early missteps, and the PM has already been defined by frequent U-turns, freezing pensioners and gifted designer glasses. That, in contrast, the genuinely good stuff – from introducingfamily hubsand theworkers’ rights billto fixingcrumbling infrastructure– has barely registered is both deeply unfair and a mess of Starmer’s own making. If you want credit for, say,extending sick payfor workers, stop banging on about taking chronically ill people’s benefits.And yet the really worrying thing for Starmer is not the critiques from his own side, but that many feel it is not worth trying any more. That some insiders are nowplottingabout how tomake Andy Burnham Labour leader– a figure who is not currently even an MP – suggests the dial has been moved. Critics are no longer at the stage of vainly hoping Starmer will be someone else. That there is a principled and politically savvy leader lurking there, who – with enough nudges – will make the right choices and listen to a diversity of voices, despite all evidence to the contrary. They know who Starmer is and the question now is: is that going to be enough? And if not, what comes next? That’s a remarkable state of affairs for a premiership with almost four years left on the clock, and a sign of just how horribly things have gone.Starmer’s trailed rebuff to the far rightand investment in deprived areasmay be the beginnings of a wider fightback. But if he wishes to turn things around, he must first grasp it is not only his career or even the Labour party at stake – it is the country. Because if Starmer does not change tack, he will not just have failed to heal the damage the Conservatives inflicted – he will have opened the door wide for a Reform government.

I watched it numerous times – but then stopped because I was so horrified.” The Canadian artist is talking about The Birth of a Nation, one of the most controversial films in Hollywood history, a three-hour silent drama directed by DW Griffith based on an earlier, obsolete novel by Thomas Dixon Jr. After its release in 1915, it provoked riots across the US for its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan. The film is widely deemed responsible for reinvigorating the Klan’s reputation and bolstering its membership. Despite attempts to ban it, The Birth of a Nation broke box-office records.It takes place in the US south during the civil war (1861-65) and the ensuing Reconstruction era. It follows members of the pro-Union, abolitionist Stoneman family and the pro-Confederacy Camerons. The plot takes in the founding of the KKK, using white actors in blackface. Douglas first thought about remaking The Birth of a Nation 20 years ago when he was doing a series of movie recreations. He abandoned the project but returned to it recently, when Los Angeles gallery The Brick invited him to make a response to the removal of Confederate monuments in the US south. “The ideas of identification, self-identification and imposed identification,” he says, speaking via Zoom from Vancouver, “all came together in my concept.”View image in fullscreen‘I got tired of spending all my money on dance records’ … Stan Douglas.Photograph: Jimmy Jeong/The GuardianDouglas, 64, was born and raised in a white, middle-class neighbourhood in Vancouver. In the 1980s, alongside artists such as Jeff Wall, Rodney Graham and Vikky Alexander, he was part of the Vancouver School, a group of young artists responding to mass media imagery with conceptual, postmodern photography and films. He studied at Vancouver’s Emily Carr College of Art, but just as important were the years he spent working as a DJ at a gay bar in the city. Eventually, he quit – “I got tired of spending all my money on dance records” – but DJing still shapes his art: “How to play the right part of the song at the right time, using culture to make new culture, using time-based media to make an idea or a feeling.”A master of the remix, Douglas is known for films and photographs that splice together the lowbrow and the lofty, turning fiction into fact, suturing landscapes and reshuffling the past. Previous works include an immersive six-hour video of an improvised jam session by a fictional 1970s band, while he has used photography to recreate the crowds at major riots around the world. He has also reworked films by Alfred Hitchcock, Dario Argento and Orson Welles. His latest show, which has just opened at Victoria Miro in London, features his remake of The Birth of a Nation.The original film explains many aspects of US culture. “The idea of whiteness comes from the 17th century,” he says. “Indentured labourers, black and white, were working together. The idea that whiteness was inherently superior – with the possibility of upward mobility, a solidarity with the elite – didn’t happen until 50 years into the slave trade.” This would be around 1670. “It was enforced by the repetition of these ideas in legislation, in churches and in town squares.”View image in fullscreenContradicting the narrative… Douglas at work in his studio.Photograph: Jimmy Jeong/The GuardianBirth of a Nation, as Douglas has called his five-channel work, remixes a particularly chilling and violent scene from the 1915 film into a 13-minute installation. Silent and shot in black and white, in keeping with the original, it focuses on a scene in which Gus, an emancipated slave played by a white actor in blackface, meets the chaste young Cameron daughter, Flora, in a forest. He proposes marriage. Appalled, Flora runs away and hurls herself off a cliff. Gus is subsequently lynched by the Klan, the mob being led by Flora’s brother Ben.In Douglas’s version, one channel plays the original scene, while the other four screens carry his remakes. His Flora is a far less sympathetic figure, who lobs stones at a bird for amusement, then trips and accidentally falls to her death. Meanwhile, other sequences contradict the narrative of the original. Douglas invents two black male characters called Sam and Tom. Like Gus, they are also freedmen who have become Confederate captains.Gus is recast as a kind of hallucination, who appears to the white characters whenever they see Sam or Tom, blurring their identities. “To them,” explains Douglas, “all black men are the same black man and are not to be trusted – a source of sexual violence.” Although the original film is more than a century old, Douglas finds some of its conflicting ideas very current, from the suggestion that “the US nation could only be born by undoing black suffrage” to the suppression of voting rights. “The Klan was the agent to take care of that,” he says of the latter, “to make the US a white supremacist society.”View image in fullscreenFive-channel remake … Douglas’s Birth of a Nation.Photograph: Olympia Shannon/Stan DouglasDouglas has produced work on this theme before. His 1991 video I’m Not Gary sees a white man mistake a black man for another called Gary. The black man responds with a frown and says: “I’m not Gary.” The 30-second video briefly made it on to Canadian TV, part of a series that ran during ad breaks. Confused viewers called the station to complain.Douglas’s last major exhibition in Europe included the film ISDN, made for the Canadian Pavilion at the 2022 Venice Biennale. In a 16th-century former Venetian salt factory, he installed a two-screen call-and-response between TrueMendous and Lady Sanity, from London, and Cairo-based rappers Raptor and Yousef Joker. Douglas found connections between the politically chargedmahraganat– Egyptian street music that emerged during the Arab spring – and the Tottenham MCs’ lyrics about race, injustice and uprising. “That period of grime,” he says, “was a soundtrack for the 2011 protests in London.”Douglas is also “a big fan of the opera”, which is what drew him to the 18th-century British dramatist John Gay. The second part of his Victoria Miro show is a series of photographs, The Enemy of All Mankind: Nine Scenes from John Gay’s Polly. These restage scenes from an obscure 1729 comic opera by Gay via large-scale staged pictures shot in the mountains of Jamaica, with Hollywood production effects. They feature American and Jamaican actors dressed in detailed 18th-century costume (borrowed from New York’s Metropolitan Opera). Written as a sequel to Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera, Polly shares its theme of misidentification and racial perception, but with a very different stance. “It’s a crazy story,” he enthuses. “It depicts imperial patriarchal hierarchies of race and class, as well as gender norms, as performative.”View image in fullscreenA pirate vanquished by a queen … an image from The Enemy of All Mankind: Nine Scenes from John Gay’s Polly.Photograph: Stan Douglas/Victoria Miro/David ZwirnerThe opera follows the capers of the eponymous protagonist Polly through the Caribbean as she tries to find her exiled husband – an escaped indentured labourer who is now a pirate called Macheath. Considered too piquant a satire at the time, with its blunt critique of Britain’s colonial ambitions, it was censored by the government and never performed in Gay’s lifetime.Like an 18th-century Some Like It Hot, it has an outlandish plot that involves subterfuge, skirmishes, colonial settlers, courtesans, a Maroon queen and pirates aplenty. Douglas sees pirates as radical political figures. “Back then,” he says, “pirate ships weren’t like in the Disney movies. They were like democracies on water.” His interest stems from his ongoing research into Maroon societies – large communities who escaped chattel slavery in the Americas and formed their own independent, free societies. In Jamaica, some of these thrived for centuries.Piecing together pivotal moments from the opera, The Enemy of All Mankind is a flamboyant visual romp with deliberately preposterous titles to steer you through the action. It gives an alternative image of history, but even here things ultimately fall apart. The pirates are defeated and, in Gay’s original, Macheath is executed. Douglas smiles. “This whole idea of liberation,” he says, “has a dark side that always comes back on itself.”Stan Douglas: Birth of a Nation and The Enemy of All Mankind is at Victoria Miro, London, until 1 November.Explore more on these topicsVideo artRacePhotographyCanadainterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, though, the podcast Wisecrack is asking the standup some difficult questions …Fri 26 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareOn Wednesday 22 July 2015, a 23-year-old man named Brett Rogers stabbed his mother and her friend 97 times, using seven different knives, over the course of an hour. Immediately afterwards, he made the short walk to the childhood home of comedian Edd Hedges, the boy he had bullied throughout school, and set about trying to break his door down.Hedges, who was staying with his parents after a local charity gig, was woken by his mother. She urged him to stay quiet and not turn on the lights. Eventually, after barricading themselves in their bathroom, the arrival of a police helicopter halted the attempted break-in. Rogers was arrested, charged and sentenced to a minimum of 32 years in prison.Two years later, this story – with several identifying details carefully obscured – formed the backbone of Hedges’sdebut soloEdinburgh fringe show Wonderland. One day, documentary producer Jodi Tovay found herself in the audience, after buying a ticket to escape the rain. She was transfixed by the storytelling, and snuck backstage to ask Hedges if she could investigate the story further. He was hesitant in a way that made her suspicious. Two years later, afterRogers had been killedin his cell by two fellow inmates, he called her and accepted her request. The outcome of this isWisecrack, a six-part podcast digging into the details around the events of that night. The project has been a runaway word of mouth hit – it is currently topping the UK iTunes charts – which makes it something of an anomaly for a true-crime show, because the crime’s victims and perpetrator are known from the start.“It’s not a whodunnit,” says Tovay from her home in the US over Zoom, on a joint call with Hedges. “We already know who did it. It’s an open-and-shut case. This is really an exploration of backstory. And it’s quite relatable, because everyone’s had a bully. We partnered with various bullying charities for the podcast, and they explained why the moment that Edd talks about is so powerful – because if you’re bullied, it’s the first expression of power that’s used against you. And if you’re the bully, it’s your first moment of feeling powerful.”View image in fullscreenOut of the spotlight … Comedian Edd Hedges.Photograph: Tenderfoot tvIn Wonderland – clips of which form the throughline of Wisecrack – Hedges details his fraught relationship with Rogers. Rogers was confident and good at sport; Hedges was overweight, dyslexic and asthmatic. During their time at school, Rogers would regularly pelt him with doughnuts. This, combined with life with a father cursed with a hot temper, made Hedges’s life particularly unhappy.“When I did the show in Edinburgh, the message was there are three examples of masculinity. There’s me, there’s Brett, and there’s my dad. They were the three characters. And all the while I was touring this, I was like: ‘This is a show about masculinity. This is about how I dealt with things, how Dad dealt with things, and how Brett was never allowed to deal with things.’ But as I’ve learned more through Jodi about Brett’s story, it has hit home in a way that I was not prepared for. The similarities between me and him were wild.”Hedges is palpably nervous as we talk. He’s softly spoken, and compulsively avoids eye contact. The release of the podcast, he says, has brought home how much he used Wonderland as a tool to stay on top of a terrifying moment in his life. “On stage, I have a say over what you think of me,” he says. “When I’m on stage, I get to control the narrative. And now the challenge that I’m having is that this is out there in the world, and people’s perception of me is being created without me being able to directly control it.”This is the neat trick Wisecrack plays. Other, more sensationalist podcasts would have glossed over Hedges completely and dived into the gory details of the murders. But Wisecrack is far more interested in the machinations of storytelling itself. The facts of the murders are incontrovertible. However, in crafting an hour-long show from it, Hedges is prone to a little artistic licence to maximise entertainment. After all, as one friend tells him in one episode, it’s called the Edinburgh comedy festival, not the Edinburgh story festival. As such, Wisecrack is Tovay’s effort to uncover what actually happened to Hedges and his family that night.“There was a point where Jodi had to ask: ‘Is this bullshit? Is all of this a lie? What are you making up?’” says Hedges. “She had to dig down into facts, and that was super-uncomfortable, because I didn’t really want to know the facts. I was protected by naivety. Talking to Jodi, I realised that I weaponised my naivety when I was doing this show live. Jodi sat me down and was like: ‘You need to answer everything. We need everything from you, every single thread.’”View image in fullscreenCrime seen … Wisecrack host and producer Jodi TovayPhotograph: Jon Buono Tenderfoot TVWhat follows is, in truth, more extraordinary than the murders themselves. Tovay begins to uncover the circumstances of Rogers’s life, his troubles and lack of support. Incredibly, she even talks to his dad. In 2012, three years before he killed his mother, Brett Rogers attacked his father Pete, stamping on his head and fracturing his eye socket. The interview with Pete is the standout moment of the entire series. You are listening to a man who endured tremendous anguish as his family was torn apart, and whose humanity in the wake of it is remarkable.“Pete is an incredible person,” says Tovay. “He is breaking the cycle of what might be typical for a man his age, and the typical way to respond to some really horrible things that happened to his family. I personally view him as a true hero in the story.”“If you knew the version of him that I grew up with, he has had a ‘come to Jesus’ moment,” adds Hedges. “He was a completely different man, and he’s gone through a proper healing journey. He has had to face a lot of demons.”Whether intentionally or not, Wisecrack is also a document of the relationship between Hedges and Tovay. She, a self-confessed “nosy American girl from a podcast” and he, a comedian torn between telling his story and wanting to protect himself. It has now been eight years since they met, and they have weathered a huge amount of ups and downs. Even during the recording of the podcast, despite Tovay going to Hedges’s village and interviewing the closest members of his family, there are moments when they don’t talk to each other.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I definitely trust Jodi more than anyone else I’ve ever worked with.”“Obviously, my expectations were very low when I first met him,” Tovay adds. “I didn’t even know if he’d respond to me at first. And to some degree, he didn’t respond many times. Now, I feel like an old friend or a big sister. It’s a very unique relationship. But personally, I think we’re quite close, and I feel very protective of you.”“If I didn’t trust her, this story would have been very hard to tell,” Hedges continues. “One of the reasons I didn’t respond to Jodi for so long is because I was like: ‘I will be damned if I’m about to put this in the hands of someone who’s going to cheapen it.’ The main thing I needed to see was respect, and respect for the fact that this is a village my family still live in.”Given that this is a story about violence fed through the lens of standup comedy, Wisecrack has drawn comparisons toBaby Reindeer. However, once it was released, the narrative around Baby Reindeer became more about the mistakes made in the duty of care towards the people depicted.“It’s not my favourite comparison,” sighs Tovay. “The responsibility towards the victims in this story, because there are two very clear victims, was our utmost concern.” However, by digging deep into the life of Brett Rogers, it also manages to take a figure who threatens to be a two-dimensional baddy and flesh him out. By the end, even if you don’t outright sympathise with him, you have a greater understanding of why he did what he did.“For a long time, I was like: ‘Oh, Brett’s the villain, 100%. He’s a bad guy,’” says Hedges. “But the one thing I hope people take away from this is that my story and Brett’s are dead parallel. My story could have so easily gone one way, and his could have gone the other. He’s a dude that went down a path and it didn’t go great, but so much of it is down to circumstance. That’s something I want people to realise.”Wisecrackis out now, widely available, episodes released weeklyExplore more on these topicsPodcastsBaby ReindeerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Moroccan artist has spent her career experimenting with colour theory, deep diving into the history of dyes, disentangling the threads of colonialism and exploitation that run through the history of art. Her show at the South London Gallery is basically colour theory as resistance, minimalism as revolt, the dyeing process as anti-colonialism.If that sounds brain numbingly leaden and eye-meltingly dull, you might be surprised by the results, because the gallery is actually a very pleasant pastel wonderland. The space is painted in thick white and light pink stripes (in a nod to aDaniel Burenmural in Casablanca that got painted over). It’s like walking through a bag of sweets. The walls are dotted with silk canvases that ripple with geometric shapes and shimmering soft colours. The dyes come from the Mothership,Barrada’s “eco-campus” in Tangierwhere she grows the plants and processes the pigments that get used in these artworks.View image in fullscreenA symbol of exploitation … Untitled, 2025.Photograph: Damian Griffiths/courtesy the artist and Pace GalleryDyes are not just colours here: they are symbols of colonial history, of how dyeing techniques have been imported and appropriated from all over the world for western financial gain. They’re symbols of industrialisation and exploitation.A pile of big monochromatic cubes in the corner is a reference to modernist urban planning in Casablanca. A vitrine is filled with wooden blocks arranged into shapes based on acrobatic human pyramids. Everywhere here there are references to Moroccan culture and the history of modernism.One work co-opts aFrank Stellapainting, reimagining its mid-century minimalism in soft silken textiles. Another uses obscure colour theory to analyse the hues of a Tintin comic book about Palestine, reducing a complex story of displacement and erasure to a grid of yellow and beige squares. These are the colours of the desert, the architecture, the history of the region as seen through orientalist eyes.Barrada’s approach is interesting, hugely collaborative and clearly intentional in the way it’s researched and expressed, but the results just aren’t particularly interesting. It all just looks like so much minimal abstraction, like grids and squares you’ve seen a thousand times. And that’s the main issue with most of the work here. As fascinating as her point may be, as clever, referential and passionate as her work is, at best it looks like a textile version of geometric modernism, at worst like a very nice silk scarf. It’s decorative and unexciting.View image in fullscreenReferencing another Tangier … Barrada’s wire crab cages.Photograph: Photo © Lucy DawkinsEven when she is exploring other ideas – such as those human pyramids, or the experimentation with “void fill” paper used in packaging and shipping – it never reaches particularly thrilling visual heights.The best work here ditches the minimalist silks for sculptural installation. Wire crab cages have been stacked together and formed into a circle in the middle of the gallery. They reference another Tangier: Tangier Island, a crabbing community in the US at desperate risk of being lost to rising sea levels. Barrada’s permeable towers are a “beau geste”, a noble but futile gesture, an attempt to build a sea wall and keep nature at bay, to resist even in the face of certain destruction.I like Barrada’s ideas, the narratives she explores, the histories she tears apart. But for the most part, the visual results are pretty, but very boring.AtSouth London Galleryuntil 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTextile artArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Both shows have a striking elevator pitch and consider how we make the most of the time available to us. Benjamin finds – and holds on to – love as he ages backwards whereas in 50 First Dates, based on the Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler romcom, Lucy and Henry endlessly replay their first encounter. She has short-term memory loss from an accident so wakes each morning with no recollection of the previous day; he ventures to sustain their relationship regardless.But while the Curious Case musical dug deep into the mysteries of time, 50 First Dates is more confined by its concept and never packs enough emotional punch. That’s partly because the book by David Rossmer and Steve Rosen can be bland and their songs breezily enjoyable, without a heart-wrenching number that does justice to the pain at the story’s centre. Nevertheless, there are two genial leads with fine voices: Georgina Castle lights up the stage as always and Josh St Clair convincingly handles Henry’s switch from obnoxious playboy to caring partner.The story is relocated from Hawaii to Key Largo, Florida. Henry is not a marine veterinarian (so no more vomiting walruses) but a travel blogger, which means he is always on the next flight after a one-night stand whereas in the film it was the tourists he seduced who moved on. His blog is devoted to creating the “perfect day” in different destinations, a rather too on-the-nose parallel to the developing plot. There’s still a homespun diner (“everything has gluten!”), run by Aiesha Naomi Pease and Ricky Rojas, with Chad Saint Louis as their Disney-obsessed waiter and a gang of locals who cheer Henry on.View image in fullscreenOde to Key Largo … the cast of 50 First Dates: The Musical.Photograph: Pamela RaithFly Davis has designed a flexible beach chic set, under the golden glow of Aideen Malone’s lighting, with restaurant booths making way for the home where Lucy’s salty father (John Marquez) and bellicose brother (Charlie Toland) devotedly conceal her condition. The film’s air of creepiness, and dismal stereotyping, are swept out.Lucy and Henry’s backstories are also clearer, his parents’ unhappy marriage explaining his fear of commitment and her mother’s death adding clearer fragility to her family. But it’s not just the diner’s waffles that come with syrup as the lyrics can be cloying. Much more effective are the comic songs in Casey Nicholaw’s production, like the ode to Key Largo performed by high-kicking dancers with fishing rods instead of canes. They are a sunny ensemble for a musical that, despite its sandy setting, remains firmly in the middle of the road.Atthe Other Palace, London, until 16 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMusicalsDrew BarrymoreAdam SandlerComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

In the early years of his transition from body-slamming World Wrestling Entertainment heavy to marquee movie star, he was still being billed under hisnom de ring. Even once he retired that moniker, he seemed to be lugging behind him a persona from which he might never be free. There are people-pleasers and then there is this affable brawler-turned-actor, who appears to regard the contentment of the world’s multiplex-goers as his personal responsibility. Whether in vehicles comic (Central Intelligence, Baywatch), family-oriented (Jumanji, Jungle Cruise), four-wheeled (theFast & Furiousseries) or disaster-based (San Andreas, Skyscraper), he is a rip-roaring razzle-dazzler, shiny of scalp and tooth, and so colossal that he isn’t merely the circus showman but the whole damn big top too.Not that he hasn’t been lavishly remunerated for all that heavy lifting. He can out-grinandout-gross Tom Cruise: Johnson has 392 million Instagram followers to Cruise’s 15 million, and was Forbes magazine’s highest-paid actor for five of the last nine years. That includes 2024, when he pocketed $88m. (Cruise didn’t make the top 20 that year.)But Johnson is the first to admit there has been trouble in paradise for some time. “I’ve been in this space for years where I wanted to do more,” the 53-year-old actor tells me over video call from Los Angeles.Things came to a pretty pass last year when his much-despised Christmas comedy-adventureRed One, for which he reportedly earned around $50m for playing Santa’s head of security, not only flopped spectacularly (it grossed $186m worldwide on a $250m budget) but was accompanied by stories of Johnson’s poor on-set behaviour: rumours of persistent tardiness (which he has denied), or his habit of peeing in bottles and leaving assistants to dispose of them (which he accepted). It’s one reason to feel disconcerted when he arrives 25 minutes late to our interview. On the plus side, the liquid in his water bottle isn’t yellow.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted to challenge myself’ … Dwayne Johnson in The Smashing Machine.Photograph: Ent-movie/AlamyHe clearly wasn’t happy. “I wanted to not only challenge myself but to listen to my gut,” he says. “To really rip myself open. And, quite honestly, I was scared. I’m not a big therapy guy. I’ve had some great conversations with therapists but it’s not the thing I run to. I bottle shit up inside me, like a lot of guys, which I recognise is not the healthiest thing to do.” He shrugs. His tight white shirt, unbuttoned to the chest, seems to stretch and creak. “Then I said: Wait, I can still do the thing I love, which is acting. But what if there’s something deeper and more meaningful in it for me?”“Yeah!”Piping up beside him, in a voice as chipper as Johnson’s is ruminative and rumbling, is the actor’s own personal hype-man: Benny Safdie, the feted 39-year-old film-maker who has helped facilitate Johnson’s swerve away from disposable entertainment to high-calibre cinema. Safdie made his name alongside his brother Josh co-directing full-blown cinematic panic-attacks such asGood TimeandUncut Gems. Now he has gone solo for The Smashing Machine, in which Johnson plays Mark Kerr, the real-life mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter who amassed a fortune pummelling opponents – and, as his might began to wane,gettingpummelled – in eye-gouging, head-kicking Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts.View image in fullscreenChaotic … Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in The Smashing Machine.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockJohnson has known Kerr since the late 1990s, when they would bump into one another on the circuit. “There was a lot of connective tissue betweenMMAin the late 1990s and what I was doing. Same arenas, same gyms. Same demons, too.” Around 2008, he became obsessed with the documentary The Smashing Machine: The Life and Times of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr, which showed Kerr at his euphoric highs and pitiful lows. The actor sensed that a dramatised film of that story would not only be compelling but could provide a solution to his brewing dissatisfaction at having acted himself into a corner. Playing Kerr, he might just be able to cage-fight his way out of his own gilded cage.And so it has proved. For The Smashing Machine, Johnson spent several hours each day having the prosthetics applied which would turn him into Kerr, but that isn’t the only reason he is unrecognisable in the film. With Safdie’s encouragement, he also located within himself an actor no one knew existed. He had previously departed from form only twice: he was used for novelty value in Southland Tales, Richard Kelly’s maligned follow-up to Donnie Darko, and was entertaining as a dumb-lug bodybuilder turned kidnapper in Michael Bay’s Pain & Gain. The Smashing Machine, though, feels fully driven by his hunger as an actor.Near the start of the film, Kerr finds it impossible to imagine what it might feel like to lose. The remainder of the movie shows what happens when this born champion is confronted by his own fallibility. Banjaxed by injuries and an addiction to painkillers, his chaotic relationship with his girlfriend Dawn (played by Johnson’s Jungle Cruise co-star Emily Blunt) starts to unravel. In the process, The Smashing Machine becomes an unusual proposition: a film about a winner who must learn how to lose, and a loving couple who probably shouldn’t be together.View image in fullscreen‘I love making the big films. But there’s something freeing about this process’ … Johnson with Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungl‪e.Photograph: Frank Masi/Sony PicturesSafdie doesn’t quibble with that description, but nor does he exactly embrace it. “I still want the audience to feel good at the end,” he says. That they do is largely down to Johnson’s charisma, which is less ingratiating now that it is complicated by his character’s pain and self-doubt. One scene in particular is a revelation. As Dawn goads and taunts him during an argument at home, Kerr – who, despite being the size of a bookcase, is as gentle and softly spoken as a librarian – lets rip, tearing the kitchen door apart as if he were ripping a tissue in two. The truly impressive moment, though, occurs seconds earlier, when his eyes drain of life and he becomes chillingly still.“I’ve never played a scene like that before,” says Johnson, hushed by the memory of it. How did it feel? “Like not acting but living in the moment. You go elsewhere. You don’t know where you’re going and you don’t know how you come back.” Safdie remembers it well: “Afterwards, we were all very emotional,” he says. “Crying and going: ‘Oh my God.’ Because you can’t express those sorts of feelings unless you’ve felt them before.”This is the first of several times that Safdie hints at the personal struggles and frustrations that his lead actor brought to the picture. “When we met,” he tells Johnson, “I saw behind your eyes this desire to really explore something about yourself.”I ask whether there were indeed autobiographical elements to playing Kerr. “In what way?” Johnson asks, stiffening slightly. Safdie leaps in to answer for him. “Well, yeah, right, because there’s that thing of having to put on a certain face for the crowd, which I knew Dwayne felt too.” He turns to Johnson again. “I knew you were telling and discovering a part of yourself also.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve never played a scene like that before’ … (from left) director Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson on set of The Smashing Machine.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockThe actor takes up the idea. “It’s the challenge of having to live up to an image. I can empathise with Mark in that. There’s this image of you and, as it forms, people keep piling shit on: ‘You can do it. Now do it like this. And here’s more, and more. Now come over here and do this thing, and that thing.’” I start to see the sisyphean side to this Rock.Like Kerr, Johnson has come to accept his own vulnerability. In a time of political tyrants and would-be strongmen, when the US president’s go-to insults are “loser” and “failing”, that puts The Smashing Machine out of step with the prevailing culture. And not only the political one. Safdie and Johnson both work in an industry that does not brook failure: flop on your opening weekend, fall short of your expected box office gross, and you can become a pariah. Colleagues will cold shoulder you at Los Angeles lunch spots. People will lose your number.Competition is endemic in Hollywood. Like it or not, Safdie himself is squaring up for a battle with his own brother: Josh Safdie has also directed a new sport drama – Marty Supreme, starring Timothée Chalamet as a fictional 1950s table-tennis champion loosely based on Marty Mauser – which is out soon through the same distributor (A24). Thetrade paper Variety predicts that Marty Supreme will dominatemost of next year’s Oscar categories, including best picture and best director, while it places The Smashing Machine’s chances mainly in the acting slots.“Look, Josh is my brother, you know?” he laughs, wriggling in his seat. “I love my brother. I think it’s cool that we both have movies out. I was joking with a friend of mine about how there are always these boxing brothers like the Klitschko and Charlo brothers. And he admitted to me: ‘I know this is wrong, but when they fight, I always wanna see them beat each other up’. And I can kinda see a little bit of that happening!” Should things turn ugly on the red carpet, at least Benny Safdie can count on Johnson to back him up, whereas all his brother has is little Timmy Chalamet.For once, the pressure is off Johnson himself. “You know, I’ll share this with you,” he says, making me lean closer to the screen. “This is the first time in my career that I’ve not thought about box office once. And I like that. I appreciate it. With the other films, the big ones, the four-quadrant movies, it’s pressurised. Sure, I love making the Jumanjis and Moanas. But there’s something so freeing about this process. We want this movie to open well and hope a lot of people like it. But for that not to bethe thing… What a difference.”View image in fullscreenJohnson in The Smashing Machine.Photograph: Ent-movie/AlamyOrdinarily, he would be quaking on the eve of a new picture coming out. “It’s a scary time because so much effort and money goes into the opening weekend here in the States. Then it’s: ‘How will it hold up? What will it do internationally? Maybe we should change that scene because it’d play better in Asia …’ I make all these big movies, and some have been really good and some not so good at all. But this was one for me.” Gesturing to Safdie, he amends his remark: “Forus.”Having tasted freedom, how can he ever go back to his old way of working? “Well, that’s a smart question. I feel like I need to have a conversation about that with my therapist Benny here.” They laugh together. But the point stands. With The Smashing Machine, it may be Johnson’s persona which has finally been smashed for good.The Smashing Machine is in Australian cinemas from 2 October and US and UK cinemas from 3 OctoberExplore more on these topicsFilmDwayne JohnsonA24Emily BluntDrama filmsBiopicsMMAinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, its writer and star is back to break the rules all over againFri 26 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 26 Sep 2025 09.01 EDTShareThere’s a scene in the new series of Dreaming Whilst Black that truly nails the feeling of wanting the ground to open up and swallow you whole. After grinding it out as a recruitment consultant and a takeaway driver, struggling film-maker Kwabena has finally landed his first TV job, directing a prestigious period drama titled Sin and Subterfuge. It’s a gruelling gig, and the fact that the lead role has been given to a ditzy reality star with no acting experience proves to be the least of his worries. Under pressure to make a stationary carriage in front of a green screen look as though it’s actually moving, he instructs the crew to grab “leaves, branches, anything you can from outside … any forms of foliage!” and wave them in front of the camera while vigorously shaking the vehicle. Screws begin to fly in all directions – and you get the sense that Kwabena’s television career is just as unsteady.Gladly, Adjani Salmon, who plays Kwabena and is also the co-creator and writer of the acclaimed comedy, is having a bit more luck. The first series of Dreaming Whilst Black was praised by critics as a sharp and surreal take on Black British life, with comparisons made to US series such as Atlanta and Insecure. For Salmon, though, some of the highest praise came from hearing that clips were being shared by Caribbean and African “aunties” in their group chats.View image in fullscreenAbsolute scenes … Adjani Salmon and Babirye Bukilwa in the new series of Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: Gary Moyes/BBC/A24Series two – due this autumn – is both funnier and more twisted, as Kwabena moves from desperate outsider to an insider with the odds still vastly stacked against him, as the making of Sin and Subterfuge descends into chaos (truly, “carriagegate” is just the tip of the iceberg). As for the foliage scene, it’s a neat – if apparently unintentional – callback to Salmon’s own career. When he, too, was toiling to get his big break in the arts, he worked as a labourer at Pinewood’s “greens” department, travelling two and a half hours each day from his aunt’s house in north London to the film studios in Buckinghamshire. There, he would fashion plants and earth into verdant sets for films such as Disney’s 2016 live-action version of The Jungle Book. “The first job I did, they pushed the shoot back, so the leaves died on all the trees,” says Salmon. “We had to spray paint them green …”Despite his mammoth Perspex sunglasses and the pile of swag bags he’s toting from an earlier PR event, when we meet at his agent’s Soho HQ it’s clear that the 36-year-old still has his feet very much on the ground. Warm and high-spirited, he is unguarded when it comes to the obstacles he’s overcome – many of which he’s channelled into the series.Do you play their game and just make money for yourself? Or do you try to uplift your people?Born in England and raised in Jamaica (his accent tends towards British in the series, but is dotted with Patois in real life), he initially studied architecture in the UK before turning his hand to video editing, working on shows such as Mission Catwalk, the Caribbean equivalent of Project Runway. After an MA in directing back in London, opportunities failed to materialise, leading Salmon and a group of friends to create a webseries in which he played a young film-maker struggling to get a foothold in the industry. This was, after all, the golden age of the webseries; among his inspirations was Awkward Black Girl, Issa Rae’s brilliant DIY precursor to Insecure.Salmon’s own webseries was released in 2018, and accepted for a number of film festivals – including one in Rio de Janeiro. Salmon had just £500 to his name, the same amount that the flights would cost. “If I drop this £500 I’m going to zero, and I’ll have to do the whole trip in my overdraft,” he recalls. He went to the festival’s awards evening nonetheless – and recalls hearing the names of other rival series being read out, again and again. “Being nominated isnota ting!” he says with a belly laugh. “Being a winner is the ting”. Just when he was beginning to lose all hope, his series began to win award after award. “I was pouring my heart out on stage [during my speeches], like, ‘I borrowed money for this shit! Man, you don’t know how much this means to me!’” The team ended up winning best international series and, almost eerily, a cash prize of £500.The TV pilot of Dreaming Whilst Black was released in 2021 and by the time it was commissioned by the BBC for a full series – with US indie powerhouse A24 extending its Midas touch alongside original producers Big Deal – Salmon had already nabbed both a Bafta for emerging talent and a RoyalTelevisionSociety award. He and his collaborators, he says, had “no idea how to make our show”, but perhaps that was what made it work. Certainly, the end result was like nothing else on TV in 2023, a series that was as likely to feature a parody of a UK government video about the benefits of the British empire as it was a bus-stop meet-cute between Kwabena and love interest Vanessa (Babirye Bukilwa).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

And they’re the crazy ones.”He is also at pains to explain that the conceit is more nuanced than just a Black man being exploited by powerful white people, instead hinging on the “complexity of what it means to be Black in the industry – do you fit in and play their game and just make money for yourself? Or do you try to uplift your people?” It’s an often impossible choice, and one he doesn’t judge people for getting wrong. Indeed, series one ended with Kwabena ditching his idea for a Windrush-era romance in favour of making a short film about his cousin’s arrest on drug charges, which prompted his acerbic uncle Claude to accuse him of exploiting his family to further his career.Season two brings with it more badmouthing from Claude and even more complexity, as a newly agented Kwabena finds himself being put forward for jobs on shows such as “Black Love: a sweeping romcom torn apart by a violent stabbing at Notting Hill carnival”. As he strives to work with a high-powered Black female producer, he also begins to wonder whether – to misquote Zora Neale Hurston – all skinfolk in the TV industry are really kinfolk. Elsewhere, he finds a rival in film-maker Tinashe (Kayode Ewumi), who brings out the worst in him. “It’s important that we show flaws in Kwabena, too,” says Salmon, “and that actually, he’s a bit of a dick!”View image in fullscreenConsomme professional … Adjani Salmon in Dreaming Whilst Black.Photograph: Gary Moyes/BBC/Big Deal FilmsIt also considers the limitations of colourblind casting, and what can go wrong when a Black actor finds themselves playing a character who was originally written to be white (and in this case, written to be aslave-ownerto boot). The practice has somewhat been abandoned in favour of “colour conscious” roles, which pay homage in part to an actor’s ethnicity, but still persists in some productions, such as the Wolf Hall adaptation The Mirror and the Light. As well as cocking a snook at the laziness that can occasionally explain such decisions, Salmon says he wanted to show how, even if “somebody [like Kwabena] has good intentions, if the system you’re in doesn’t have them, it hard fi’ come out the other side with a product that feels cared for”.If there is a show that feels cared for, though, it is Dreaming Whilst Black. Key to this is a lightness of touch that seems to extend off screen. A short walk from his agent’s office, in Soho’s maze of post-production houses, I observe Salmon as he watches back a few particularly hysterical scenes, including one where Kwabena launches into an R&B song in the middle of a fancy restaurant before washing his hands in a bowl of consomme. Salmon asks the editor to bring his voice down a little in the mix, to make it seem a little less like he’s belting, while everyone in the room – directors, publicists, producers – roars at the scene.The show’s Regency-inspired shoots–complete with dream sequences where Kwabena and Vanessa enjoy their own period romance–were equally amusing, says Salmon. “It almost felt like everybody was Kwabena,” he laughs. “Because we were scrambling to film all of this stuff in a house that we can only afford for three days.” He relished the chance to see what costume designer Jodie-Simone Howe and makeup designer Cynthia De La Rosa could do when it came to putting a Caribbean spin on period style, too. And from a traditional red plaid Jamaican bandana reimagined as a waistcoat to Salmon’s freeform locs coaxed into the shape of a stiff, powdered wig, the looks are all totally delightful to see imagined on screen. As well as its very meta critiques and send-ups of the entertainment world, many of the lighter parts of Dreaming Whilst Black come from its stories about family and relationships. This time around, that means a plot involving the later-in-life romance between Kwabena’s mum, Grace, played by Jo Martin, and her plumber, Errol. It was, says Salmon, “almost an ode to my mom, or my aunts. I’m glad that we could do a storyline for them.”As Salmon gets ready to record some additional dialogue for the show, we chat about his other projects – among them a family sitcom and an intriguing-sounding dystopian political drama. And, perhaps, more Dreaming Whilst Black, which ends on a big old cliffhanger. “We’dloveto do this again. If we end the series here, the message would be dark! So for everybody’s sake, I hope we get to do it one more time.” One thing’s for sure: he’ll be back in the Aunties’ WhatsApp groups before he knows it.Dreaming Whilst Black returns to BBC Three 10pm, 9 October. All episodes will be available from 6am on BBC iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTV comedyTelevisionComedyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Born in the midwest and based in New York since the 90s, Grimstad is a literature professor at Yale, has written essays on Jimi Hendrix and Alan Turing for the New Yorker, and has composed music for a number of films, including last year’s The Sweet East, to which he contributed Evening Mirror, a charming hypno-folk track featuring lead actor Talia Ryder. He’s also an actor, and has small parts in Paul Thomas Anderson’s new Thomas Pynchon adaptation One Battle After Another, as well as Marty Supreme, Josh Safdie’s ping pong biopic starring Timothée Chalamet and Gwyneth Paltrow.And then there’s Songs, his debut album, released this month alongside Music for Film, a compilation of his scores. A maniacal odyssey of prog, jazz, boogie rock, psych and pop, Songs pays homage to the hi-fi chaos of 70s art-rock classics such as Todd Rundgren’s A Wizard, a True Star, rarely staying in one lane for more than a couple of minutes across its breakneck 16-track, 40-minute runtime. Performed, produced and engineered entirely by Grimstad, Songs is catchy, hilarious and terrifying in equal measure: passages of sleek funk-pop rub up against snatches of psychotic haunted-house laughter and songs indebted to Philly soul at its sleaziest. Grimstad is an astoundingly talented producer, and it’s a credit to his skill that, despite all the bird coos and whiplash-inducing changes of pace, Songs is a delight to listen to – lush and ludicrous in all the right ways.Shaad D’SouzaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenJuana Molina.Photograph: Verena AlgrantiJuana Molina – Siestas AhíThe Argentinian experimental legend returns after eight years away with this gorgeous devotional about dissolving in someone’s kisses, her strange, ticking guitar suddenly gleefully unfurling like a party blower.LSUFOs – UFOFrench touch royalty Braxe + Falcon and Phoenix unite for this woozy, melancholy throb, with Thomas Mars singing about the irrational nature of belief as he pleads to be let back into someone’s heart.LSPaul St Hilaire andShinichi Atobe – Time to Wake UpSt Hilaire is the defining vocalist of dub techno, and his new album pairs him with an awesome array of producers from Mala to Batu; Japanese deep house genius Atobe gives him an insistent, aqueous riddim.BBTLael Neale – Some Bright MorningOmnichord and vintage drum machines power the momentum of Neale’s ode to the dream of a day when work is finally over.

Corot does not view their lives with either sentimentality or rage. This seems a genuine document of what he saw one early morning in the western Burgundy region when country folk were at work under the trees and a goose was walking by. What gives it such a matter of fact conviction is Corot’s brilliant eye for passing light. From the town silhouetted against the morning sky to the play of sunlight and shadow on rocks in the foreground, there’s a feel of fluid, ever-changing sunshine here that anticipates the impressionists.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get in TouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Concluding the reasons forhis decision, he said: “I find that these proceedings were not instituted in the correct form, lacking the necessary DPP [director of public prosecutions] and AG [attorney general] consent within the six-month statutory time limit set by section 127.“The time limit requires consent to have been granted at the time or before the issue of the requisition. Consequently the charge is unlawful and null and this court has no jurisdiction to try the charge.”Michael Bisgrove, for the prosecution, previously told a court that permission from the director of public prosecutions and attorney general was not required until the defendant’s first court appearance and that permission did not need to be sought in order to bring a criminal charge.The chief magistrate dismissed the arguments, telling the court they “defy logic”.There were loud cheers from the public gallery as the chief magistrate handed down his judgment. Ó hAnnaidh smiled and gave a thumbs up sign to his supporters.The Crown Prosecution Service said it was “reviewing the decision of the court carefully”. It said the decision could be appealed.Dozens of Ó hAnnaidh’s supporters, who had gathered outside the court, cheered as the decision was relayed to the crowd. Some waved Palestine and Irish flags. Others held aloft placards that read Free Mo Chara, referencing the rapper’s stage name.Ó hAnnaidh, who is referred to by his anglicised name Liam O’Hanna in court documents, arrived at court wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh, a balaclava in the colours of the Irish tricolour and sunglasses.After walking out of the court he told supporters: “This entire process was never about me. It was never about any threat to the public, it was never about terrorism – a word used by your government to discredit people you oppress.“It was always about Gaza, about what happens if you dare to speak up.”He added: “Your attempts to silence us have failed because we’re right and you’re wrong. We will not be silent. We said we would fight you in your court and we would win. Today, we have. If anyone on this planet is guilty of terrorism, it’s the British state. Free Palestine.”The West Belfast MP Paul Maskey, who attended court on Friday, said the decision not to proceed with the trial was the right one. “Kneecap have bravely and unapologetically used their platform around the world to call out Israel’s genocide and the complicity of western governments,” the Sinn Féin politician said.“It is the Israeli war criminals and those who fund, support and enable genocide and forcibly starve women and children who should be before the courts, not Kneecap’s Mo Chara. The British political assault on Kneecap which led to this case has failed. Today, those on the right side of history have prevailed.”Kneecap’s manager, Daniel Lambert, wrote on X: “We have won!!!!!! Liam Og is a free man. We said we would fight them and win. We did (Twice). Kneecap has NO charges OR convictions in ANY country, EVER. Political policing has failed. Kneecap is on the right side of history. Britain is not. Free Palestine.”Lambert said he was not surprised the case was thrown out and that the group will not change “anything they do”.Asked if he has a message for Keir Starmer, O hAnnaidh said: “Better luck next time.”Northern Ireland’s first minister, Michelle O’Neill, welcomed the decision. In apost on X, she said: “All charges have been dropped against Kneecap’s Mo Chara. I strongly welcome this decision. These charges were part of a calculated attempt to silence those who stand up and speak out against the Israeli genocide in Gaza.“Kneecap have used their platform on stages across the world to expose this genocide, and it is the responsibility of all of us to continue speaking out and standing against injustice in Palestine.”Explore more on these topicsKneecapUK security and counter-terrorismNorthern IrelandIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s mortifying. What’s happening is no less than a genocide and it’s terrible.”Actors and directors pledge not to work with Israeli film groups ‘implicated in genocide’Read more“What makes me so sad is the disrespect in the discourse of American politics right now and how that is going to be normalized to the kids right now,” she added. “It’s going to be normal to them that politicians lie.”The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 people, injured more than 160,000, and reduced much of the territory to ruin since Hamas-led attacks killed 1,200 people in Israel on 7 October 2023. About 15 of every 16 Palestinians killed by the Israeli military since itbroke a ceasefirein March have been civilians, according todatafrom the independent violence-tracking organization Acled. The Guardianrevealedlast month that internal data from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) found a civilian death toll of 83% between the outbreak of the war in October 2023 and May of this year.Lawrence urged attendees at the film festival to “stay focused on who is responsible” rather than directing their anger at actors and artists, probably a nod to arecent pledgesigned by more than 400 entertainment industry figures to boycott Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”. Thepledge, inspired by the cultural boycott that contributed to the end of apartheid in South Africa, differentiates between complicit institutions that continue to partner with the Israeli government, such as the Jerusalem film festival, Haifa international film festival, Docaviv and TLVFest, and individual film-makers. “This refusal takes aim at institutional complicity, not identity,” reads the pledge, whose signees include Mark Ruffalo, Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman, Ava DuVernay, Javier Bardem, Rebecca Hall and Yorgos Lanthimos.Lawrence is not among the signees, nor has she signed anopen letter, signed by Liev Schreiber, Debra Messing, Mayim Bialik and 1,200 other entertainment figures, calling the pledge “a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art”.‘Extreme anxiety and extreme depression’: Jennifer Lawrence says she felt ‘like an alien’ as a new motherRead moreAsked her thoughts on attacks on free speech in the US, Lawrence answered: “Our freedom of speech and expression is under attack and I think the world of cinema and using your voice in artistic ways, having festivals like this where we can learn from each other and realize we are all connected and matter and deserve empathy and freedom, are important.”Lawrence is set to receive the honorary Donostia award at the San Sebastián film festival on Friday, before screening Die, My Love, on which she also served as producer.The film, directed by Lynne Ramsay and based on a novel by Argentine writer Ariana Harwicz, depicts a mother in rural America, played by Lawrence, battling psychosis that imperils relations with her husband, played byRobert Pattinson. Nick Nolte, Sissy Spacek andLaKeith Stanfieldalso star in the film, set for domestic release on 7 November.Explore more on these topicsJennifer LawrenceGazaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Stairs,” he joked.Jimmy Kimmel: ‘Only Donald Trump would try to prove he wasn’t threatening ABC by threatening ABC’Read moreKimmel said that afterTrump’s UN speech, which was “an hour of bragging and bullyingand BS”, Americans might want to “pretend to be Canadian” when going abroad.Despite Trump claiming that the US is the “hottest country anywhere”, international coverage showed him to be the “world’s most powerful manbaby”.This week, the president alsosignedan executive order to place TikTok under US ownership, so that instead “our government can spy on Americans”,withRupert Murdochamong those who will have control.“Are we really safer going from the Chinese government to the Murdochs?” he asked, while joking that “leftwing libtards control everything and it isn’t fair”.Kimmel’sreturn to airon Tuesday also saw his second-highest-rated show in almost 23 years with the host alsobreaking his YouTube record.“We couldn’t have done it without you, Mr President, so thank you very much,” he said.Stephen ColbertOn The Late Show,Stephen Colbertalso spoke about Trump “waging a campaign of vengeance” against a UN escalator.He said that Trump “walked up the stopped escalator sometimes known as stairs”, which the president has since described as a “harrowing experience”. Colbert poked fun at his long social media post about it.Stephen Colbert on Jimmy Kimmel: ‘To know him well is to admire him immensely’Read more“Usually when a drama queen throws that much of a hissy, at least Andy Cohen interviews them after the show,” he said.Colbert was relieved that no one was hurt because he will “enjoy showing that footage every night until May”.Trump has also been “taking a bunch of decorative dumps on everything” with a new presidential walk of fame in the White House, inspired by a display he saw at the Hilton.“The White House doesn’t need a tribute to presidents; the White Houseisa tribute to presidents,” he said.Inevitably it included a “pathetic” jab at Biden with a portrait replaced by a picture of his autopen.This week has also seen the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth,axe a panelencouraging women to enter the military as part of his “war on woke”, but it was created in 1951 by Harry Truman.“Oh yes, that famous liberal snowflake,” he said.Seth MeyersOn Late Night,Seth Meyersalso spoke about the escalator and how Trump is often described by his followers as “a big, strong, masculine guy” yet he wrote about his terror over the “sharp metal edges” he was faced with this week. “It’s an escalator, not T-100,” Meyers said.He played clips of Fox News hosts recounting the tale “like they’re telling a spooky story at a campfire” while they have also expressed annoyance at the Secret Service for not doing more. “Would it have been better if someone had screamed ‘Black Hawk down’?” he asked.The week has seen Trump attempt to seek out the “dastardly perpetrators” who stopped an escalator and has had pundits tell of their own personal experience with escalators.“Everywhere they look, Maga sees a shadowy conspiracy, whether it’s escalators, climate change or elections they don’t win,” he said. “Reality doesn’t conform to their preexisting agenda so they have to imagine a sinister fantasy.”Explore more on these topicsLate-night TV roundupJimmy KimmelStephen ColbertSeth MeyersDonald TrumpUS televisionTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The ECU concluded: “References to ‘free Palestine’ and ‘from the river to the sea’, while viewed by some as implying the disappearance of the state of Israel, can also be regarded as no more than expressions of support for aspirations to a Palestinian state and do not of themselves threaten violent action.“‘Death, death to the IDF’ is clearly more problematic, but it is directed at an institution rather than individuals, and one which is not defined by ethnic or religious composition.”It was also cleared of breachingBBCimpartiality rules. The ECU said it “took the view that coverage of a music festival is clearly not on the same footing as coverage of news and current affairs; and, while there may be festivals the BBC would not cover on account of their polemical character, a wide tolerance for expressions of opinion by performers or audiences would be in keeping with audience expectations for events it does cover.”Bob Vylan have repeatedly defended the statements they made at the festival; they also projected a message on stage that read: “Free Palestine – United Nations have called it a genocide – the BBC calls it a ‘conflict’”.Glastonbury organisers said they were “appalled by the statements made from the West Holts stage by Bob Vylan”.BBC director general Tim Davie said: “I deeply regret that such offensive and deplorable behaviour appeared on the BBC.”After the incident, the BBC removed the footage from on-demand services and said it would no longer broadcast live performances it deemed “high risk”. The BBC chair Samir Shah called it “unquestionably an error of judgment”.Enquiries are continuing in Avon and Somerset police’s investigation into Bob Vylan’s comments at the festival. A spokesperson told the Guardian: “Our investigation team is considering all appropriate legislation, including relating to hate crimes. It is also important we have a full understanding of any legal precedents, which is a complex process, and we are working closely with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for early legal advice, and with other UK police forces.“We recognise the strength of public feeling around what took place, and we hope the ongoing enquiries provide reassurance and show the seriousness with which we are treating this investigation.”The band also had their US visas revoked after Glastonbury.Earlier this month, a forthcoming gig in the Netherlands was cancelled by the venue afterBobby Vylan was accused of celebrating the killing of Charlie Kirkon stage in Amsterdam. He called the late far-right influencer “an absolute piece of shit of a human being” and said “if you chat shit, you will get banged”.The Tilburg venue 013 said that his comments went “too far” and pulled the band’s show. Bobby Vylan clarified in a subsequent video: “I did call him a piece of shit, that much is true, but at no point was his death celebrated.”Explore more on these topicsMusicBBCGlastonbury festivalFestivalsBob VylannewsShareReuse this content"

With his wife and writing partner Marilyn, Bergman, who has died aged 99, created a catalogue of indelible showstoppers from a string of some of Hollywood’s best-loved films, on which they collaborated with a string of prestigious composers.They enjoyed great success with Michel Legrand, with whom they won the first of their three Academy awards for The Windmills of Your Mind (sung by Noel Harrison in The Thomas Crown Affair, 1968), and their third for their work on the Barbra Streisand vehicle Yentl (1983). Streisand scored a US Top 40 hit withThe Way He Makes Me Feelfrom the Yentl soundtrack. It was also with Legrand that they composed one of their most haunting pieces,What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?from the film The Happy Ending (1969). It earned them an Academy award nomination and would be recorded by numerous artists.They won their second Oscar in partnership withMarvin Hamlisch, their musical partner on The Way We Were from the eponymous Streisand/Robert Redford film (1973). Streisand’s recording of the theme song topped the US chart and sold two million copies. Other memorable collaborations came withQuincy Jones(In the Heat of the Night), Henry Mancini (All His Children, from Sometimes A Great Notion) and Dave Grusin (It Might Be You, from Tootsie).Bergman joked that he and Marilyn had indulged in ‘pre-marital rhyming’ before becoming wed in 1958The best singers inevitably gravitated to the best writers, and the Bergmans’ material was performed by the most celebrated vocalists of the 20th century, including Frank Sinatra,Tony Bennett, Celine Dion, Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, Sarah Vaughan and Neil Diamond. In 1978, Diamond and Streisand’s duet recording ofYou Don’t Bring Me Flowers(written by Diamond and the Bergmans for the TV sitcom All That Glitters) topped the US Billboard chart. This was after Diamond and Streisand had each recorded a solo version of the song, which several radio stations spliced together to create an unofficial duet. This prompted the singers to go into the studio to record an “authorised” duet. In 2011, Streisand released the album What Matters Most, a collection of songs with lyrics by the Bergmans.Streisand later said that Bergman “was family to me – a father figure”.In the film Yes, Giorgio (1982),Luciano PavarottisangIf We Were in Love, composed by the Bergmans with John Williams. The song earned one of three Oscar nominations for the Bergmans in 1983, alongside If We Were in Love and How Do You Keep the Music Playing? (from Best Friends). Nevertheless, they were beaten to the award that year by Up Where We Belong, from An Officer and a Gentleman. Between 1970 and 1996, the couple received 16 Oscar nominations.In addition, they won three Emmy awards. One was for the 1976 TV movie Sybil, and the other two were in collaboration with Hamlisch, including the songOrdinary Miraclesfor a Streisand TV special in 1995. The Way We Were also brought them a pair of Grammy awards, and in 2013 the Bergmans were given a Grammy Trustees award.Born in Crown Heights in Brooklyn, Alan was the elder of two sons of Samuel and Ruth (nee Margulies) Bergman. His father was a clothing salesman. Alan had begun studying piano aged six, and also began writing song lyrics as a young boy. After attending the Ethical Culture Fieldston school and Abraham Lincoln high school in Brooklyn, he went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.View image in fullscreenBergman performing at a We Write The Songs concert at the Library of Congress  in Washington DC in 2015.Photograph: Leah Puttkammer/FilmMagicHis education was interrupted by the second world war, and he was drafted into the US Army in 1943. He was wounded while serving as an infantryman, and reassigned to Camp Butner, North Carolina. There, he gained some valuable experience by creating shows for the army’s Special Services entertainment branch.After completing his studies at Chapel Hill in 1948, he moved to California to take a master’s degree in music at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He met the singer and composer Johnny Mercer. As Bergman recalled: “When I was a graduate student at UCLA, [Mercer] took a liking to me, and between the years 1952-55 he was like my mentor ... I would not be here today without him. He was a great influence.”Bergman worked for a time as a television director for the WCAU station in Philadelphia while collaborating with Lew Spence, a songwriter, in Los Angeles. The Spence-Bergman composition That Face proved to be a turning point in his life. Marilyn Keith was also working with Spence as a lyricist, and Bergman wrote his lyric for That Face with her in mind. Keith’s favourite actor was Fred Astaire, and after Astaire recorded That Face, Bergman presented Marilyn with a copy of it. He simultaneously delivered a marriage proposal, which she accepted. “Instead of a ring, he gave me Fred Astaire,” she later commented.By the time they married in 1958 they were already writing together (“premarital rhyming was going on,” Alan later wisecracked), and among their early hits werethe calypso-style Yellow Birdfor the Norman Luboff Choir (1957) and the title song for Sinatra’s album Nice ’n’ Easy (1960). He described their collaborative writing process as “like pitching and catching, back and forth. And when we write four bars or eight bars, I sing them, so singing is a part of the process. It’s constant, back-and-forth communication.”In 2007 Alan released the solo album Lyrically, Alan Bergman, featuring 13 songs with lyrics by the Bergmans. A reviewer for Jazz Times detected hints of Sinatra, Astaire and Chet Baker in Bergman’s singing. Additional projects by the Bergmans included the stage musicals Something More! (1964) and Ballroom (1978), and theme songs for TV series The Sandy Duncan Show, Maude, Good Times and Alice. The couple were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1980 and received its Johnny Mercer award in 1997. In 1995 they were given a lifetime achievement award from the National Academy of Songwriters.Marilyn died in 2022. Alan is survived by their daughter, Julie, and granddaughter, Emily.Alan Bergman, songwriter, born 11 September 1925; died 17 July 2025Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockBarbra StreisandFrank SinatraMusicalsTelevisionobituariesShareReuse this content"

If the Book of Kells was made in Pictland, this rewrites our understanding of early medieval Scotland.”Her research has led her to conclude that a monastery in Portmahomack, Easter Ross, north-east of Inverness, is “the most likely place for it to have been made”.Its monks were manufacturing vellum – the calfskins on which manuscripts were written – as well as creating elaborate carvings with complex inscriptions that match those of Kells, unlike manuscript and carved inscriptions from Iona, which reflect “plainness and legibility”, she said.Were the monks on drugs? How The Book of Kells went fully psychedelicRead moreWhitworth argued that while the Kells monastery was founded in AD807, it did not become important until the later ninth century. “This is too late for the Book of Kells to have been made at Kells. The Iona hypothesis, while worth testing, has no more intrinsic value than any other,” she said.Portmahomack flourished as one of the earliest Christian sites in the land of the Picts from about 700 to 800, when it was destroyed by fire, possibly in a Viking raid.Whitworth said archaeologists had discovered a fine sculptor’s chisel at the site of the monks’ vellum workshop, suggesting that book-making and stone-carving were intimately interlinked.She pointed to a stone carving – part of a larger cross-slab now in the National Museums Scotland – whose Latin inscription has parallels with the text of the Book of Kells: “It is the most elaborate piece of carved stone from anywhere in the early Middle Ages in the British Isles. It [has] a long Latin inscription in relief, very beautiful lettering that’s very similar to Kells … these fabulous display capitals.“The art of the Book of Kells is very different from the Iona stone sculpture, which, while high quality, lacks this endless inventiveness and unpredictability.”It was not until the 1990s that Portmahomack was discovered to have been the site of a major Pictish monastery, through archaeological excavations led by Prof Martin Carver and published in 2016.Whitworth said previous scholars had argued that the script of the book looked far more like that of manuscripts associated with the Northumbrian island monastery of Lindisfarne than anything associated with Ireland. “The Northumbrian monks are known to have mentored the Picts. However, until recently there had been no Pictish monastery to link it to, and these suggestions were ignored or dismissed. The Picts had suffered for many decades from being seen as mysterious, remote and backward.“If you just look at the archaeology of our top early medieval monasteries, Portmahomack stands out as exceptionally literate and book-orientated. The standard books will say there are no Pictish manuscripts. We need to flip that on its head and say that the Book of Kells is actually an exceptionally Pictish-looking manuscript.”Rachel Moss, a professor of history of art and architecture at Trinity College Dublin, said: “During the period when the Book of Kells was made, there is lots of evidence of the movement of holy men, artists, objects and materials across Ireland, Britain and the continent. Unless actually recorded in a manuscript, it is nearly impossible to pinpoint where it was made, or by whom.“As the Book of Kells first enters the historical record at the County Meath monastery of Kells, historians have traced it back to the monastery from which Kells was founded at Iona. One of the special aspects of the manuscript is how a range of artistic influences from across the known world were blended to form a unique art style.“Dr Whitworth’s exploration of the manuscript in the context of the archaeological excavations at Portmahomack adds another dimension to the debate.”Whitworth, who specialises in the art, literature and archaeology of Britain and Ireland AD700-1100, will publish her research in her forthcoming book,The Book of Kells: Unlocking the Enigma, to be published by Head of Zeus in October.The Book of Kells by Victoria Whitworth (Bloomsbury Publishing, £35).

So there’s a sly irony that those same characteristics – embodied in his pampered film star Abel – don’t really work on the bar worker, Marion (Sara Giraudeau), he meets not-so-cutely. She has her own, unstarry problems, which means their union is a slow burner.

It’s a quote that Islam reproduces in his autobiography, viewing it as a benediction, but it also tells you something about the music that made him globally famous.In the early 70s, the charts were awash with sensitive folky singer-songwriters. Their constituency, as Islam perceptively notes, was “the college generation, away from home, lonely and trying to find their place in the university of high academic expectations”. But none were as obsessed with spirituality as Cat Stevens, with his album titles that namechecked Buddha or referenced Zen poems, his conceptual song cycles based on numerology, his lyrical exhortations to “kick out the devil” and “get to heaven, get a guide”, and Morning Has Broken, the hymn he made a 1972 US No 1. If you’d had to place bets on which 70s superstar would pack it all in for religion, you’d have got far lower odds on Cat Stevens than, say, Noddy Holder.Indeed, reading his autobiography, his retreat from pop stardom seems less surprising than the fact he stuck it out for as long as he did. Living above his parents’ Shaftesbury Avenue cafe, he enjoyed a “street-loose” childhood: the early chapters depict a London baffling to the modern reader, in that ordinary people could actually afford to live in W1. Equally surprising is Islam’s love of his primary school. When a 1950s nun-run Catholic school appears in an autobiography, it’s almost invariably a source of unending misery, but no; he’s enraptured by the mysticism of mass, and haunted by the suggestion that angels start taking note of your misdeeds when you turn eight.There are plenty of misdeeds to note: by his early teens, he’s attempting to balance school with life as a pill-popping mod. Galvanised by Dylan, he becomes a folkie and starts writing songs. He spends less than a year trying to attract interest, before scoring both a record deal and an immediate hit with his 1966 debut single, I Love My Dog. Its follow-up, Matthew and Son, reaches No 2 in the UK. It’s a meteoric rise – he’s still only 19 – and Islam seems to have hated every minute. Live shows are “degrading” and “intolerable”, having his photo taken is “as close to hell as I ever want to get”, interviews are akin to being “placed in the stocks”, appearing on television is more like “the gallows”, and his mohair suit is too itchy (“a horror”). Within months, he’s calculating how much money he’ll need to make in order to retire.Buddhism, the Bible, meditation, the I- Ching: you couldn’t accuse him of not shopping around before settling on IslamA brush with tuberculosis and a stay in hospital prompts a rethink: out with the heavily orchestrated pop singles, in with guitars and soul-searching lyrics. In remarkably short order, he’s more successful than ever: 1970’s Tea for the Tillerman and 1971’s Teaser and the Firecat each sell nearly 4m copies worldwide. Their sleeves featured children’s book illustrations suggesting a certain faux naivety – so, for that matter, does each chapter in his autobiography – but the lyrical soul-searching isn’t a posture. As the 70s progress, he tries Buddhism, the Bible, meditation, the I Ching: you couldn’t accuse him of not shopping around before settling on Islam, spurred by a near-death experience in the ocean off Malibu.Booze and drugs are abandoned, his girlfriends (tellingly plural: for a man who didn’t care for stardom, Islam certainly enjoyed its spoils) are ditched in favour of a traditional Muslim marriage. Giving up music seems to have been less of a wrench than you might expect. His songwriting had “reached a cul-de-sac”: with his royalties to live off, he genuinely seems happier doing charity work.Given his aversion to interviews, he’s an unlikely choice as a spokesperson, but he can’t escape his old celebrity. The media are either baffled or hostile, particularly after 9/11, when his high profile lands him on a no-fly list (“a real success story in the war on terror,” quips US chatshow host Jon Stewart, “we finally got the guy that wrote Peace Train”). Occasionally, he doesn’t help himself: it probably wasn’t the smartest idea to make what he insists were jokes about the Salman Rushdie fatwa on national TV (he also alleges canny editing on the programme-makers’ part).Still, he claims that the ensuing furore led him to investigate Islamic jurisprudence further, which in turn led him back to music: cue comeback albums, tours, Glastonbury, even a return to the name Cat Stevens. He seems happy, ending his story with a poem that opens “when I was a little foetus”. Whatever you make of that, it reads remarkably like one of the more wide-eyed lyrics from his heyday. Yusuf Islam has been on quite a journey, but some things never change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There’s a lot going on these days on the lush forest moon of bioluminescent ferns and giant blue space cats. We’ve had the forest tribes, the sea tribes, even the bit where Sigourney Weaver gets reincarnated as her own teenage daughter. And now in Avatar: Fire and Ash,the first full-length trailer for which launched this week, we get a full-blown theological crisis, and a planet that might be running out of breathable air.Oona Chaplin’s Varang is the leader of the Ash clan, who look like Cirque du Soleil performers who’ve been left too close to the barbecue. She’s extremely angry and cynical because her entire extended family got flambéed by a volcanic eruption. But even more so because Eywa, the godlike neural network that can unleash planetary catastrophe at will, did absolutely nothing to help.This sets up an intriguing wrinkle for the new movie. If the god that rules your planet isn’t mystical, ineffable and comfortingly invisible, does that make it any easier when she abandons you? And is Eywa even capable of stopping volcanoes in the first place? Can she really shut down a minor geological tantrum? Maybe not. Also, isn’t deciding you’re an atheist when there’s palpable proof that your god exists a bit like declaring you don’t believe in digital media while streaming Love Island on your phone? Who needs faith when you’ve got swishy USB-compatible tails that can plug straight into the creator? Why indulge in blind devotion when it’s far easier to just complain down the divine helpline that the floating mountains still haven’t been fitted with railings, or the banshees keep crashing into the washing line?Either way, Varang is clearly severely annoyed, and out to take revenge on anyone who thinks Eywa rules, which apparently means teaming up with evil Colonel Quaritch and his human overlords. This brings us to the other major plot point being hinted at: are the mean old homo sapiens terraforming Pandora to kill off the Na’vi?!There’s a key point in the trailer where we see Spider, the Sullys’ human pal, remove his mask and breathe without difficulty, which is quite an impressive feat when we’re told the atmosphere on this forest moon is a dense blend of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, xenon and methane. Jake Sully then appears to suggest that this development means the Na’vi might one day become incapable of breathing on their own planet. But then another scene sees Spider apparently plugging into a Pandoran sea creature, as if he were a native, which suggests the earthlings might be genetically altering themselves to suit their new environment (Spider is, after all, Quaritch’s son) rather than the other way around.If that’s the case, it’s hard to know what is scarier: the idea of humans rewiring their own biology to pass as Na’vi, or the possibility that they’re quietly terraforming Pandora so the locals eventually suffocate. Either way, it’s colonialism with the dial snapped clean off. Not content with stealing the land and resources, the humans are now determined to tilt the entire biosphere in their favour.Frankly, there is an awful lot to dig through here. If the mere trailer is this dense, watching the actual movie (which is rumoured to be even longer than Avatar: The Way of Water’s three hours and 12 minutes) is going to be like shinnying up Mount Everest, only to find James Cameron waiting at the summit with a three-hour slideshow of bioluminescent plankton and extraterrestrial religious schisms.

However, Lacrima gathers its pace meditatively before it begins to hurtle and then becomes devastating viewing from which you can’t look away.The marriage of an unnamed British princess has been announced and the making of her wedding dress, by a British designer, is under way. He enlists a Parisian atelier that outsources its most labour-intensive work to an Indian tailor. The dress is a wildly elaborate concoction of embroidered silk, handmade lace and a 200-metre train of 150,000 pearls.Using four languages, with English surtitles, the production initially seems like a documentation of processes and the invisible labour involved in such an illustrious commission. We variously follow Marion (Maud Le Grevellec), head seamstress at the Paris workshop, a group of lace-makers in France, and the ageing tailor, Abdul (Charles Vinoth Irudhayaraj), who works quietly, relentlessly, with needle and thread. There are video calls with the princess and interviews with French lace-makers who speak of inheriting their dying craft. A French official delivers pedantic rules to an Indian manager and it becomes clear the international codes of conduct offer no protection to Indian workers, serving only the French atelier.View image in fullscreenA world of suffering … the set of Lacrima.Photograph: Jean-Louis FernandezWritten and directed by Caroline Guiela Nguyen, the human drama emerges to take gradual hold until it is a chokingly emotive story of overwork and enslavement. The creation of the dress contains a world of suffering, devotion and conflict. Scenes of Marion’s abusive marriage to Julien (Dan Artus), an insecure pattern-maker at the workshop, are masterfully enacted and horrifying in their realism. The sight of Abdul, who sits sewing pearls on to the dress’s train, slowly going blind through the intensity of the work, is deeply moving.It is almost too painful to watch as characters feel the crushing pressure of their jobs, all emotional and family life squeezed to the sidelines. Yet many regard the work as a vocation, dedicating themselves to the creation of beauty. It does not erase the circuit of exploitation, but makes this story all the more emotionally complicated. The making of a single dress gains shades of Greek tragedy.Alice Duchange’s set design transforms by turns into the Parisian atelier, the world of the lace-makers and the workshop in Mumbai. There are video split screens above the stage that draw your eye to a face or a pair of hands engaged in lace-making or embroidery.It is clear that the show has been comprehensively researched and that information is deftly sewn into the drama. It has some extraneous strands – a subplot involving an elderly lace-maker and a hereditary illness is perhaps overcomplicated, while the sweary British designer sounds slightly off-key. But this is a monumental, magnetic production.AtBarbican theatre, London, until 27 September, then touring internationally.Explore more on these topicsTheatreBarbicanFashion industryreviewsShareReuse this content"

The title was not indicative of its contents – this was a collection of droll, desolate dirges recalling the lugubrious greats (Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits) – yet Trinidad, the opener of his band Geese’s fourth album, actually does feature some metal-style screaming. What begins as an exercise in dreamlike, deconstructed soul soon erupts into a nightmarish cacophony of erratically parping brass, scrambled guitar and the shrieked refrain: “There’s a bomb in my car!”View image in fullscreenGeese: Getting KilledGetting Killed ripples with a timely dread: a combination of sonic dissonance – 100 Horses’ ramshackle maximalism, the title track’s frantic pile-up of voices and grooves – and surreal, sardonic lyrics. (“All people must smile in times of war”; “I’m getting killed by a pretty good life.”) Yet unease also stems from the creeping suspicion that these songs double as private jokes – Geese are school friends – and rock music itself is the butt of them: profundity is routinely undercut by silliness (“like a sailor in a big green coat, you can be free”) while gorgeous Van Morrison-esque melodies are delivered in a ludicrous warble.Getting Killed can be opaque, but its brilliance is still obvious: the invention, the irreverence, the melodic knack, the swagger all great bands require. “If you want me to pay my taxes,” rasps Winter over falsetto backing vocals and syncopated drums, “You better come over with a crucifix / You’re gonna have to nail me down.” A sideways invocation of this era’s dark absurdity offset by the succour of a lovely classic rock melody; it’s Geese’s considerable appeal in a nutshell.Explore more on these topicsIndiePop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Doja Cat’s new album is titled Vie – French for “life” – andthe original artwork(changed at the last minute) features the 29-year-old Angeleno surrounded by roses, ever the picture of congeniality. Doja has become known, in recent years, as mainstream pop’s master agitator: she tells her superfans to “get off your phone, get a job and help your parents with the house”, disavows her own hits before they’ve even left the upper echelons of the charts and is totally unapologetic about what can be described, charitably, asedgelord behaviour. Doja’s 2023 album Scarlet – a prickly, antagonistic record designed to prove her bona fides as a rapper – seemingly shut the book on her time as a pop hit-maker with a bracing, refreshing meanness.View image in fullscreenThe (new) artwork for Vie.Photograph: APSo there is precedent for the notion that Vie’s lead single Jealous Type – a piece of slick, cinematic 80s pop of the kind Doja used to toss off with abandon – was a fake-out. It’s not exactly that: Doja’s fifth album does find her returning to the sugary, aerodynamic well of her 2019 LP Hot Pink and 2021’s Planet Her. This time around, it feels as if she and producer Jack Antonoff have found a more comfortable middle ground between the gloss of that world, which she’s criticised over and over again, and the desires of the brilliantly snarky fire-starter who tore her way through Scarlet.Hearing the push-and-pull between those sides of Doja is enormous fun. AAAHH MEN! is like a sinister take on Chic’s Le Freak, its blown-out, sleazy strut a perfect soundtrack for Doja’s conflicted internal monologue: do I want to take a guy home for sex, or just to lambast him? It’s hard to tell which she’s leaning towards: “I have too much tolerance / You ugly and fine as shit / And if I had more common sense / Then I would grab my ride and dip,” she raps, clearly relishing the opportunity to trifle.Doja Cat: Gorgeous –video‘It’s like, wow. I was really deranged’: stars and repentant stans on the terror of toxic fandomRead moreMore often, it’s a sweeter side of Doja taking hold, although rarely the uncomplicated sexpot of early singles such as Say So. On Silly! Fun! she raps with flustered abandon about being in love for the first time over the kind of dazed, lovesick production that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Chappell Roan record. When she raps “I’m inlove” or “let’s havekids,” the final word of each phrase is sung by a disembodied backing vocal, like she wouldn’t dare say it out loud – a charming, canny detail. Doja has said she probably wouldn’t listen to this music herself, but she’s locked in nonetheless, applying the same detail to frothy pop songs as she does to one-liners such as: “He ain’t hungry for money / I told him: ‘Come eat the rich.’” (See seventh track All Mine.)Can a leopard change its spots? That seems to be the question Doja is trying to answer musically and lyrically across Vie. She is smart enough not to give any clear answers, ending the album with Come Back, a glowing, bitter love song that shares a strand of its DNA with Donna Lewis’s I Love You Always Forever. “I’m pleased I ain’t the bitch you was hopin’ for / If we keep this up and you hold my doors / And you take my bag, and you hold me more / I don’t think that would make up for the hope I lost,” she raps, weariness coating every inch of her voice. There’s no trolling here – just an earnest relationship postmortem, set to production that’s so twinkly and lovesick it would make even Carly Rae Jepsen blush. A leopard can’t change its spots, but maybeDoja Catcan.Explore more on these topicsMusicDoja CatPop and rockRapalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Reissuing out-of-print rarities along with new interpretations from contemporary artists, their albums have included 2017’s exploration of Kenyan Benga music, a 2021 recording of the oral traditions of Gulf pearl divers and most recently a catalogue of Greek orthodox singing from the monastery on Mount Athos. Their latest edition is equally specific, delving into both archival and new French-language Creole music from Louisiana.View image in fullscreenPasé Bél Tan: Francophonies & Creolities In LouisianaInfluenced by the birth of jazz in New Orleans, as well as early blues, rock’n’roll and French colonial legacy, this largely African American folk music of the 1950s to the 1980s veers from poignant lyricism to rollicking, full-throated celebration. The dancefloor-focused side of the archival material features several infectious songs from bandleaderClifton Chenier. Known as the founder of Creole folk genre zydeco, Chenier’s arrangements incorporate bluesy guitar riffs alongside scraping washboard rhythms and the metallic twang of piano accordion. The resulting sound, on Laissez les Bon Temps Rouler and Jolie Blonde, is deep-swinging and joyous, anchored in Chenier’s own whooping vocalisations.That foot-stomping feel reverberates through Isome J Fontenot’s lively harmonica playing on La Banane à Nonc Adam. The contemporary recordings are equally upbeat, meandering from rap verses to techno bass and industrial distortion, but prove too wide-ranging to cohere.‘He made the dust fly!’ Mick Jagger and others on 100 years of Clifton Chenier, the king of zydecoRead moreInstead, it’s in the more minimal, vocal-led arrangements that the album truly shines. Singer Alma Barthélémy’s recording of Ma Bonne Créole aches in its tender vibrato, while Caesar Vincent’s nasal tone lends a searching feel to the a cappella ballad Travailler C’est Trop Dur. These quiet moments offer an affecting window into history; even through lo-fi recordings, you can hear the singers’ breathy, yearning tones, calling out into the Louisiana wetlands for someone to listen.Also out this monthBeirut-based sextetSanamrelease their excellent second album,Sametou Sawtan (Constellation). Psychedelic guitar swirl, Arabic lyrics and pounding drums cohere to create a loud and lively eight tracks, with highlight Harik using singer Sandy Chamoun’s gasping vocalisations as punctuating rhythm. Ethiopian singerMeklit’s husky vocal power drives her jazz-influenced latest albumA Piece of Infinity (Smithsonian Folkways), featuring elaborate interpretations of Ethiopian folk songs embellished by roaring horn fanfares and intricate percussion. Senegalese singerCheikh Lôreturns with his first album in a decade,Maame (World Circuit). Typically uplifting, Lô’s arrangements are full of lilting finger-picked guitar melodies and his own softly wavering voice that displays a new warmth at 70.Explore more on these topicsMusicGlobal album of the monthJazzBluesPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Each of the five short movements of Abstractions of 2016, ranging from the urgently hyperactive to the dreamily impressionistic, was inspired by a work in the Baltimore Museum of Art, while the punchy Restless Oceans, which Clyne composed for Alsop in 2018, alternates brutal Stravinskyan insistence with moments of lyrical respite.

My tip: spend a Saturday eating entirely from thecity-wide market– Normandy cider, fizzing with crisp and juicy apples; the freshest oysters, shucked before your eyes and eaten right there and then; and topped off, of course, with the famous Normandy cheeses camembert and Pont-l’Évêque. It’s France at its best.AaronPicos and tapas in Santander, SpainView image in fullscreenPlaya de Matalenas, SantanderPhotograph: Tamara Kulikova/AlamyHop on a ferry fromPlymouth to Santander(with a spot of whale watching en route). Twenty hours later, the rugged cliffs and crashing waves of northern Spain struck us as reminiscent of the Cornish coast, and temperatures were delightful – warm and sunny but not too hot. Despite its beauty and golden sand city beaches, fantastic seafood and tapas, Santander doesn’t feel particularly touristy.

With a journey time of around 30 hours, there’s plenty of time to relax and watch the Bay of Biscay go by (we saw whales and dolphins, as well as a beautiful Atlantic sunset). Once you arrive in Bilbao it’s fairly obvious you should check out theGuggenheim, wander the old town and eat pintxos. But it’s also really worthwhile to take aboat trip up the riverto see where the urban regeneration stops and where there are reminders of the city’s industrial heritage.KatieThe mini-Amsterdam with a buzzView image in fullscreenLeiden is like a smaller scale version of Amsterdam, says our reader.Photograph: Martin Bergsma/AlamyLeiden – between the Hook of Holland and Amsterdam – is a fantastic destination easily reached by ferry, whether from Newcastle, Hull, Harwich or Dover. It offers everything Amsterdam does but on a smaller scale and with canals visitors can enjoy. It’s easily reached by road and rail, and has great places to stay, eat and enjoy. The mainly pedestrianised and historic town centre is beautiful, with a fantastic Saturday market along the canals. The large student population gives it a really nice buzz, all year round.Ruud Jansen VenneboerWinning tip: Newhaven to Dieppe and football in Le HavreView image in fullscreenLe Havre fans ramp up the atmosphere at a home match.Photograph: Lou Benoist/Getty ImagesMy teenage boys and I went fromNewhaven, East Sussex, to Dieppe, Normandy, in late August. We found Dieppe to be a smart resort town with some great cafes, restaurants, history. Then it was on to Le Havre to catch the Ligue 1 football match between Le Havre AC and Nice. The home team’s club song is the same tune as God Save the King – chosen by the expat Brits who formed the club in 1872. The atmosphere in the Stade Océane was fantastic – we stood in the home end with the (friendly) ultras, waving flags and singing songs.

Dense yet tender, plush with fruit and rich with toffee, it’s simple enough for a weekend pudding, and special enough to be served at a gathering.Toffee apple pudding cakePrep10 minCook1 hr 30 minCool30 min+Serves8125g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra, softened, for greasing200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting2 small apples, preferably granny smith150g small, firm dried figs, chopped into roughly 1cm pieces1 tsp bicarbonate of soda2 tsp baking powder½ tsp ground cinnamon¼ tsp fine sea salt200g light muscovado sugar1 large egg1 tsp vanilla extractFor the toffee apple topping3 small apples, preferably granny smith100g unsalted butter100g light brown muscovado sugar1 tsp lemon juice100mldouble cream¼ tsp flaky sea saltGrease a 23cm bundt tin thoroughly with the extra softened butter, then dust some flour all over the inside. Rotate to coat tin entirely, then turn upside down and tap firmly over a bin to remove the excess flour. Set aside in a cool place.Peel, core and cut the apples into roughly 1cm dice (you will need 200g diced flesh), then place in a medium saucepan. Add the chopped figs and 250ml water, put on a medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the fruit breaks down and most of the liquid has evaporated – the mix should remain moist and spoonable, not dry. Stir in the bicarb then take off the heat and leave to cool to room temperature.Heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/380F/gas 5½. Sift the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt into a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment on medium-high for about two minutes, until lightened. Add the egg and vanilla, beat until just combined, then turn down the speed to low and, in alternate batches, add the sifted dry ingredients and the apple-fig mix.Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool for at least 30 minutes, then invert the cake on to a serving plate.Meanwhile, make the toffee apples. Peel, core and quarter the apples, then cut each quarter into four. Put a tablespoon of the butter and two tablespoons of the sugar in a large saute pan, add the apples and lemon juice, then cook, stirring regularly, over a medium heat for eight to 10 minutes, until the apples soften and turn golden. Add the remaining butter and sugar, stir to melt, then add the cream and salt, and stir gently to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for one or two minutes, until thick and glossy. Take off the heat and spoon the apples all over the top of the cake. Serve with cream or creme fraiche.Baking and the Meaning of Life by Helen Goh (Murdoch Books, £26).

Are any actually worth saving?, 23 September).I am the head chef at a private members’ club in London, and I can assure you that these “endangered” British puddings absolutely thrive in such establishments. I suspect that is not only down to our clientele, but also because we cook them properly. I’m afraid the photos accompanying the article show that the author made rather a poor attempt at recreating these wonderful British classics, and so I’m not surprised that he gives them such bad reviews.A jam roly-poly, with homemade jam (plum or damson at this time of year is excellent), well made and properly cooked, and served with custard and perhaps some stewed fruit, is an absolute delight.Simon ConyersHead chef, Buck’s ClubI am now 82 and grew up eating puddings (with custard) every day, either at home or as a part of school dinners. They were good for filling empty bellies and adding that bit of sweetness that we all seemed to crave after the war, but they were not exciting. I am happy enough to do without them now, with one exception, which is the glorious Sussex pond pudding, much maligned by Tim Dowling.The combination of seasonal fruit (not necessarily apple), light suet pastry and the delicious lemon-flavoured syrup is absolutely mouth-watering. And you don’t have to wait three and a half hours for it. Hasn’t he heard of a pressure cooker?Margaret KilohBattle, East SussexI must protest. Tim Dowling may be a brave and amusing experimenter, but he should never have cooked Sussex pond pudding with apple in it. The filling should be a lemon cut into quarters, brown sugar and butter, which, after the long steaming, results in a luscious lemon marmalade, contrasting with the crisp suet casing. It was my late husband’s favourite pudding, served with plenty of cream, of course.Valerie PedlarSouthport, MerseysideTim Dowling missed a trick with bread-and-butter pudding that elevates it to a 5 on his taste scale: instead of bread, use sandwiches made with butter and marmalade as the base material, or even croissants, split and stuck together with butter and marmalade and then sliced.Matthew LowyDrayton, OxfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
