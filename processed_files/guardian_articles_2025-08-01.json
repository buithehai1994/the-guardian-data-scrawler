Here is an outrageous history of small-screen saucinessHollie RichardsonFri 1 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 12.40 EDTShareOutlander first sizzled our screens in 2014, with Vulture soon declaring that the period drama had “the best sex on television”. Its tale of second world war nurse Claire (Caitriona Balfe) time-travelling to 18th-century Scotland and falling in love with clansman Jamie (Sam Heughan) certainly earned the accolade. The wedding night episode features Claire reaching such an explosive orgasm that it requires smelling salts for viewers to get through. There’s a knee-trembling “castle cunnilingus” scene and, at one point, the extraordinary moment when Claire saves Jamie’s life by masturbating him. It has proved so popular that in 2026 its eighth (and final) season will air.In the last year we’ve had shows such as Carême, about a Napoleonic-era celebrity chef who likes foreplay with a dollop of whipped cream, and orgy-filled Mary & George, about the lover of James I of England/James VI of Scotland. Outlander has even spawned a prequel, Blood of My Blood, about the entwining stories of Claire’s and Jamie’s parents, two couples who also enjoy time travel and sex. Sure enough, there’s a romp against a table less than half an hour in, a dizzying amount of hand brushes and a sex scene that clocks up nearly 10 long minutes. How did period dramas get so raunchy?Thirty years ago, things were much more chaste. The iconic moment of Andrew Davies’s 1995 BBC adaptation of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice that shook up the genre didn’t even involve nudity – just Colin Firth’s Mr Darcy emerging from a lake in a soaking white shirt.Firth’s chemistry with Jennifer Ehle, who played Elizabeth Bennet, was undeniable: the two started dating in real life during filming. No one has sex in the series, but Davies wrote in scenes to show the hormonal young characters’ physicality and sexuality, andlookedfor “any legitimate excuse to get some of that kit off”. It certainly won over fans: last year, the shirt Firth wore sold at auction for £25,000. One professor even told the BBC that the series has “almost usurped the original novel in the minds of the public”.Seven years later, Davies shocked the nation by writing a drama that makes Pride and Prejudice look like CBeebies: an adaptation of Sarah Waters’ Victorian-set lesbian novelTipping the Velvet. Nan (Rachael Stirling) is an oyster girl who is enchanted by androgynous stage performer Kitty (Keeley Hawes). She joins her act in bohemian London and they start a sexual relationship. It divided critics, with one calling the first sex scenes “dull”. He should have stuck around for episode two.Anna Chancellorenters as dominatrix aristocrat Lady Diana – the proud owner of a massive dildo. “It was leather, wasn’t it?” asks Chancellor when I remind her of it over video call. “Was [its size] believable?” She has never seen the series and says she would have to be “really old” to stomach watching herself in it. Filming was physically difficult as the camera went round and round while she rocked on Nan’s lap. That said, she would “quite like to play [Diana] again”, and adds: “It gave me a big lesbian following, which I was thrilled with. It’s a privilege.”The show was groundbreaking for queer sex on screen, but Chancellor makes the point that it was directed by a straight man (Geoffrey Sax). “I think they wouldn’t do that now,” she ponders. Intimacy coordinators weren’t a thing back then either. Even though she admits to some of their tasks being more cringey than actually shooting sex scenes (like softly touching each other’s face and hair), she says a great one can help map out the characters’ physical relationships more convincingly: “It’s how you get there.”View image in fullscreenNo facts attached … Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII) and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn in The Tudors.Photograph: BBC/SonyBodice-and-breeches rippers soon took off. In 2007, all historical fact went out of the window when Jonathan Rhys Meyers played Henry VIII as a hunky, brunette sex god inThe Tudors. Within four minutes of the opening episode, Henry and Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) were bonking. Hundreds of outraged fanscomplainedit was too Americanised, dumbed down and hypersexual. “These people didn’t have TVs, they didn’t have cars, they didn’t have iPods. They had sex. What else do you think they did?”Meyers once said, clearly fed up of defending it on press tours.Anyway, Henry was left in the dust in 2015, whena topless Aidan Turnerscythed his way on to prime time inPoldark. It set pulses racing to such an extent that Turner came to resent it: “It began to overshadow the show and that frustrated me. It just got boring,” he admitted of a scene that would go on to be voted TV moment of the year.View image in fullscreenFantasy … Aidan Turner getting ready for his topless scene in Poldark.Composite: PA/ BBC/Everett/Rex FeaturesBut it wasn’t the only scene to trigger debate. A scene in which Poldark forcefully kisses ex-lover Elizabeth (Heida Reed), who pushes him away and says “no” until finally conceding to sex wascriticisedas a “rape fantasy”. Poldark isn’t the only period drama tofeature problematicsex scenes. Outlander iscontinually pressedon its repeated use of brutal rape as a narrative tool – which they put down to this being a reality that can’t be totally ignored: rape only became a statutory offence in England and Wales in 1956 (and marital rape wasn’t included until 1991). In Scotland, rape was an offence in common law only until 2009. Catriona Balfe also justifies it by saying: “We have a problem in our society with sexual assault, and it’s reflected in our storytelling.”With TV audiences becomingless conservativeand streaming networks offering new freedoms, period bonkbusters went wild in the early 2010s, fromThe Borgias(which featured anincest scene) to Versailles (“four racy scenes in just 17 minutes!” cried the Daily Mail). Like most of the shows before them, they were largely written and directed by men. They also nearly always featured white leads; period drama has always had a problem with diversity. However, coinciding with the #MeToo movement, a spate of brilliant female storytellers were about to bring nuance and raise the bar once more.View image in fullscreen‘We never said titillating’ … Jessica Brown Findlay as Charlotte (centre) in Harlots.Photograph: Liam Daniel/Hulu/Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn 2017, Alison Newman and Moira Buffini co-createdHarlots, a Georgian-set drama with a diverse cast, starring Lesley Manville and Samantha Morton as warring brothel owners (it has recently enjoyed a new lease of life in Netflix’s Top 10 chart). Set in a time when sex work was incredibly valuable to the economy, it is, of course, stuffed with graphic scenes. But don’t conflate sex with “sexy”; Newman even bristles at the word when I mention it to her over the phone. It was unofficially banned from the writing room, and that wasn’t all: “Weneversaid titillating.”The show was made entirely by women from what Newman calls “the whore’s eye view”, following “a sort of reverse Bechdel test” with no more than two men in a room. Sex was a job for these women and it needed to feel real: it’s often boring or humiliating, sometimes enjoyable and at times dangerous. There’s also barely any nudity because undressing took too long.Still, there are rare moments when sex is an act of love or passion, such as when Charlotte (Jessica Brown Findlay) sleeps with male sex worker Daniel Marney (Rory Fleck Byrne) after a season spent building a friendship. “Charlotte obviously had a very complicated relationship with sex, so for her to let go like that or make herself vulnerable – it was a big moment.” That is indeed what makes sex, well, sexy (sorry Newman!). “The drama is in the desire – and what happens before and after the act is most interesting … If it’s just a couple of people shagging, then what’s the point?”View image in fullscreenIntimate moment … Sophie Rundle as Ann Walker and Suranne Jones as Anne Lister in Gentleman Jack.Photograph: Aimee Spinks/BBC/Lookout Point/HBOAround the same time, Sally Wainwright was working onGentleman Jack, a drama about 19th-century Yorkshire landowner Anne Lister (Suranne Jones) who is widely considered the first modern lesbian, and her relationship with Ann Walker (Sophie Rundle). Tabloids called the same-sex scenes “steamy” and “shocking”, but a lot of care was taken with them. “We used the camera to come in on us and find intimate moments,” Jones said. “By the end, me and Sophie were like two nans with a cup of tea. Like, covers off, hanging out. And it was great.”Andrew Davies also created another barrier-breaking adaptation of Austen – her unfinished novelSanditon. This time, he went as far as adding in sex scenes.“I write something that I would like to watch,” he said. “And I suppose the sexing it up thing comes in fairly naturally.” Not only that, a scene showing the bums of two nude male characters going for a swim – which they would have done in those days – raised the issue of objectification. “Are there different standards? So what if there are,” star Kris Marshall said. “Is it the objectification of men when we’ve had the objectification of women for so long?” (A2016 reportfound that female nudity was almost three times as likely as male in Hollywood films.)But raunch comes in all forms. For many viewers, one of the most erotic scenes on television in recent years was Andrew Scott in silk pyjamas dancing to T Rex’s Dandy in the Underworld. He played Lord Merlin in Emily Mortimer’s adaptation of Nancy Mitford’s 1930s coming-of-age storyThe Pursuit of Love. It was a casting masterstroke. Merlin sticks his middle finger up, slinks around and – in a flooring moment – abruptly kisses one of the beautiful young things, wipes his mouth and spins her away. “That was all him, he just delivered,” Mortimer tells me over a call. “It just came so easily, and he went for it. He has exactly the right amount of charm, fearlessness and a kind of twinkle.” It was shot during lockdown and the first thing Scott said to her after filming that scene was: “I just feel so lucky to be at a party!”The reaction of Lily James’s teenage character Linda, who is watching from the sidelines in a ballroom, mirrors our blushing at home: she is full of lust and longing for life to start, and finds Merlin’s sexual liberation almost too painfully sexy to watch. “Lily did it so well,” says Mortimer. “It’s hilarious but also kind of heartbreaking and very recognisable.”Smaller moments really do have the power to fluster a nation. Regency-eraBridgertonis one of the biggest and raciest shows today – and a celebration of how far we have come regarding sex in period drama, with diverse characters having lots of sex that is both a hoot to watch and always female focused. It also gave life to the more X-rated spin-off Queen Charlotte(she did have 15 babies, after all). But, arguably, it is Regé-Jean Page’s Duke of Hastings simplylicking a spoonthat went viral and became Bridgerton’s most definitive scene.View image in fullscreenA spot of spooning … Regé-Jean Page as the Duke of Hastings in Bridgerton.Photograph: PRFor now, though, it’s full steam ahead in Blood of My Blood. Harriet Slater, who plays Jamie’s mother Ellen, tells me the chemistry read with Jamie Roy (her onscreen forbidden lover Brian) was “unlike any other”. Roy says: “The sparks do fly.” And there’s that epic sex scene, whose shooting involved turning raunchiness into something as highly choreographed and rehearsed as a stunt or dance. Sometimes, though, you can have too much sexual tension. “On the very first take I burst out laughing! I got told off very swiftly,” smiles Roy. “If you take it too seriously, you get too tired!” adds Slater. But did they pull it off? “Smashed it.”Outlander: Blood of My Blood is on MGM+ via Prime Video on 9 August.This article was amended on 1 August 2025. An earlier version said that rape only became illegal in the UK in 1956. This is when it became a statutory offence in English and Welsh criminal law; it had long been a criminal offence in common law.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionPeriod drama (TV)DramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

And what can you do about moles? Our gardening expert has the answersClaire RatinonFri 1 Aug 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 10.06 EDTShareAs any gardener knows, we share our outdoor spaces with a vast array of creatures. This is mostly a wonderful and necessary thing. The majority of beasts are beneficial and ought to receive the warmest of welcomes. And given the biodiversity crisis, we must reconsider who we regard as a “pest”. Having said that, there are organisms whose presence can imperil our garden plans.When I was studying the principles of growing food organically, I was taught a systems approach to dealing with so-called pests: choose your interventions carefully and opt for the least disruptive before considering more drastic measures.Encouraging wildlife into your garden is the first step to limiting pest damage, as a balanced ecosystem will see naturally occurring predators manage the creatures that bother your plants. Alongside this, raising strong plants and ensuring the soil they’re growing in is healthy will result in a more resilient patch.If there’s a creature that reappears every season, or you’re growing a plant that is of interest to a certain insect, installing a physical barrier to protect your plants from damage can limit interference with the balance of the garden’s ecosystem. The carrot root fly, for example, can be stopped using insect-proof mesh.Despite our best efforts, it’s inevitable that sometimes we don’t spot damage until it’s already done, but I’d encourage you to avoid chemical measures that would cause destruction to the surrounding environment, or lead to the wholesale eradication of any population, which might then disrupt the food webs they’re part of. Before you attempt whatever quick fix the social media algorithm has sent your way, read on for interventions that have a decent chance of working.Will eggshells and coffee grounds protect my plants fromslugs and snails?How to manage slugs is my most-asked question, even though the Royal Horticultural Society has stoppeddescribing these molluscs as pests, and says that only nine of the estimated 44 UK species of slug are “notable plant nibblers”.In my experience, coffee grounds and eggshells do little to protect plants. Beer traps do work in that they coax slugs into a yeasty, watery grave, but they require monitoring, emptying and refilling, which is not a pleasant task. How effective they are depends on how many you put out and the size of your slug population.What does work is limiting places for slugs and snails to hide near your plants (wooden edging, bricks, pieces of wood), and encouraging predators such as frogs, newts and toads by installing a pond and maintaining wild areas for the amphibians to hunt in. Nematodes are also effective, but only in contained spaces because biological control (introducing organisms in places where they would naturally occur to boost the population) doesn’t really work without boundaries.As for using wool to deter molluscs, I visited a gardener last year who claimed that surrounding tender plants with it had proved successful, but I suspect that it wouldn’t remain effective after heavy rain or watering.Will peeing in the garden deter foxes?I once worked on a growing space where foxes would chew through and rearrange our irrigation pipesweekly. It was infuriating, and if I’d had access to adequate volumes of urine to deter them I might have given it a go, as the smell can disrupt the boundaries of their territory and urge them to move elsewhere. Given how accustomed city foxes are to humans, this might only work in the countryside. Also, you would probably need to be weeing outside every day for it to put them off.A better approach would be to plug the holes in your fences and secure your bins to make your garden and food sources less accessible. If you find fox poo on your beds, try using chilli and garlic as a deterrent as they hate the smell, and cover any bare soil with holly clippings to make for a less comfortable toilet.Will my old CD collection keep birds from eating my strawberries?Birdwatching is a principal pleasure of spending time in green spaces. Unfortunately, some species are as interested in the kale and strawberries we grow as we are.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Edith Pritchett/The GuardianCDs or recycled foil hung around the garden will reflect light and keep birds off crops, but my go-to solution is bird-proof netting, carefully secured at the edges or installed over a cage so they don’t sneak under and then get stuck.A traditional scarecrow might work for a short time, but the birds will get used to it. I reckon an inflatable dancing tube man would do a better job if you’re happy for your garden to look like a forecourt selling secondhand cars.Is using pesticide the only way to protectbrassicas?A few different butterflies and moths lay their eggs on the underside of leaves in the brassica family. When those eggs hatch into caterpillars, it can be a matter of days before a robust purple sprouting broccoli is reduced to a skeleton. Large and small cabbage white butterflies appear in my veg patch without fail every year and are the reason my 2023 season was entirely kale-free.Butterflies and moths are an important food source for many animals, including bats, so ideally our efforts to protect crops ought to encourage them to lay their eggs elsewhere. The most effective approach in my experience is fine, insect-proof mesh, which also stops pigeons from stripping leaves. And try planting nasturtiums as a companion plant because, despite them not belonging to the brassica family, large and small whites will lay their eggs on them, too.Can I simply wash aphids off my plants?Sap-sucking insects that feed on new plant growth cause distortion and stunted growth; they also invite disease. There are various species,and they feed on a wide range of plants, so they’re a common sight. These insects are, in turn, a food source for other creatures – including ladybird larvae, lacewings, hoverflies and insectivorous birds – so I tend not to panic when I see them as I’m fairly certain their predators will be along soon to keep their population in check.Pinching out the tips of plants, growing sacrificial plants such as nasturtiums, and gently washing the aphids off with water are low-intervention methods. Avoid using so-called “natural” remedies such as neem oil, which will kill insects beyond the target species.Is the only way to get rid of a mole to call the ‘mole man’?Like ants, moles aren’t after your plants, but what they get up to beneath them can be devastating. These rampant little burrowers feast on soil organisms such as earthworms, and if you’re actively encouraging soil life with generous amounts of compost, it’s no great surprise that a mole might move in.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Edith Pritchett/The GuardianAs they are territorial, it’s likely you have only got one mole burrowing around your garden, and the main, humane way of encouraging it to move along is to get on its nerves. Moles are extremely sensitive to vibration and noise, so you can buy devices to stick into the ground that buzz regularly, or commit to a daily stomping ritual around your plot and hope that does the trick.A neighbour did once offer me the number of the “mole man”, but I’d rather have an empty veg plot than the death of a mole on my conscience.Does boiling water get rid of ants?Ants aren’t really a bother in themselves (although a red ant bite can be a nasty surprise), but they can make your aphid problem worse. Ants “farm” aphids by moving them to your plants so they can feed and breed, then the ants feed on the aphids’ honeydew (the sweet substance they excrete – yuck!)Ants like to nest in dry soil, so mulching regularly to ensure your soil is moisture-retentive can discourage them from setting up home near your plants. If they’re already there, keeping the soil moist (but not drenched) will encourage them to move on. Boiling water can kill ants, but that’s cruel and unnecessary.Do I need to get a cat to save my beans from hungry mice?Whether you’re growing in the countryside or the city, mice will be nearby. They are happy to munch on so many different plants – from germinating peas to newly planted bulbs – that once they’ve got their teeth into your planting plan, it can be enough to make you give up on gardening.These rodents can be a challenge to manage and, yes, a cat would be very helpful. But if, like me, you’re seriously allergic to felines, try using row covers or fine mesh pinned down diligently. I have also found that – as with foxes – laying plenty of prickly holly clippings around plants does the trick.Explore more on these topicsGardensGardening adviceOrganic gardeningEthical and green livingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even so, Israel has become a Millwall among the nations, apparently unbothered by and impervious to the condemnation of a watching world – condemnation which this week gained serious momentum.As one country after another pointed an accusing finger towards Israel, repelled by the starvation, devastation and bloodshed it has brought down on Gaza, Israeli officials offered the now-familiar middle finger in return. When Keir Starmer announced Britain’s intention to recognise a state of Palestine, it was swiftly brushed aside by the deputy mayor of Jerusalem as “much ado about nothing”.There was a similarly dismissive reaction to both France’s earlier pledge to make the same diplomatic move andCanada’s announcement on Wednesdaythat it would follow suit. Sometimes, the register is studied insouciance, a shrug of the shoulders; sometimes it’s anger. But the message is consistent: we won’t budge. As the Israeli ambassador to Canada put it: “Israel will not bow to the distorted campaign of international pressure against it.”Yet for all the Shakespearean references, the “diplomatic tsunami” which Benjamin Netanyahu’s critics warned of for many years, and which now seems to have arrived, is not nothing. What’s more, and underneath the Millwall bluster, there are signs that Netanyahu knows it.More than140 of the 193 member statesof the UN had already recognised Palestine, but that club will soon include major western powers: the shift by France, the UK and Canada means no fewer than three members of the G7 are now on board. This same week saw a special conference convened at the UN in New York, where 125 countries urged Netanyahu to commit to the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, as they sought to resurrect the long-moribund two-state solution.All this diplomatic activity has prompted a series of objections from Israel and its defenders. First comes the claim that Israel’s critics are appeasers. WitnessNetanyahu’s tweeted riposte to Starmer, which included the line: “Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails.” Netanyahu often likes to invoke Winston Churchill and here he is again, casting himself as the Greatest Briton with Starmer as Neville Chamberlain, while hisforeign minister is full of talk of Munich and 1938. As if there is any analogy between Nazi Germany grabbing a chunk of Czechoslovakia and Palestinians seeking self-determination in their historical homeland. It’s a line of argument insulting in its ignorance.Next comes the charge that the likes of Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney are “rewarding terror”, handing Hamas a prize for the murderous series of atrocities it staged on 7 October 2023. But that’s an odd way to read what just happened. This week’s New York declaration, which was signed by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and the Arab League, explicitly condemns “the attacks committed by Hamas against civilians” on that day, the first such official denunciation by the Arab states.Moreover, the document is unambiguous that “Hamas must end its rule inGazaand hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority”. The same message comes through loud and clear in the declarations made by Starmer and his counterparts: it is the PA, currently led by Fatah, that they envisage as the recognised authority of a Palestinian state. The leaders can be faulted for failing to explain how this vision of theirs will be realised, but the vision itself is straightforward – and there is no place in it for Hamas. Hard to spin that as a “reward”.2:12Starmer says UK will recognise state of Palestine unless Israel meets conditions – videoMore forceful is the objection made by those campaigning for the release of the 20 Israeli hostages still believed to be held alive in Gaza. They argue that Starmer erred badly in suggesting that the UK would not go ahead with recognition of a Palestinian state if there were soon to be a ceasefire deal between Hamas andIsraelin Gaza. That, the campaigners argue, in effect incentivised Hamas torefuseto do any deal – which would have to include the freeing of at least some hostages – so that UK recognition goes ahead as promised.Starmer’s defenders believe this line of argument rests on a misunderstanding of Hamas. That group is not interested, they say, in a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza, living alongside Israel. Hamas is not in the two-state business, but rather seeks to rule over a single, jihadist state across the entire land, from the river to the sea.Indeed, given that the international community supported the principle of Palestinian independence before 7 October, to abandon it afterwards would itself be to reward Hamas, allowing that group to derail the two-state solution which it has been determined to sabotage since it first sent suicide bombers on to Israeli buses more than 30 years ago.More powerful still is the charge that these announcements and declarations are displacement activity, gestures that reveal nothing so much as the various governments’ impotence. There is something to that: diplomatic recognition will not feed a single child in Gaza. When Starmer’s various demands on Netanyahu are blithely ignored, it will only advertise the British PM’s weakness. In a way, the move this week tacitly recognises that reality. It is predicated on the notion that Israel continues to act in ways that make a two-state solution less viable. Previously, Starmer had always said he wanted to wait until UK recognition could play a part in an unfolding, meaningful peace process. Now he has acknowledged that there is no such thing, that he risked holding on to a card that was turning to dust in his hands. Better to play it now before it becomes entirely worthless. As Wes Streeting put it, the UK should recognise Palestine “while there is still a state of Palestine to recognise”.I lead a top Israeli human rights group. Our country is committing genocide | Yuli NovakRead moreThe hope in London, Paris and elsewhere is that, when the Gaza war eventually ends, the parameters of what should follow will already have been staked out. But, of course, Netanyahu is not listening. He made the decision long ago that Israel can ignore everybody – that the EU and the UN, along with every global institution from the World Health Organization to the BBC, can all be written off as hopelessly biased, if not bigoted – with only one exception: the US. Over the past decade or more, he has gone further, writing off half of the US too, choosing to ignore all Democrats and focus only on the Republican party. So long as Israel has the GOP’s backing, it’ll be fine.That has always been a reckless strategy and this week confirmed the danger of it. For one thing, Israel needs the support of more than one country. The EU and UK may not match the US as arms suppliers, but, economically, Israel needs them as trading partners, on favourable terms. Besides, the US Republican party is not a wholly reliable ally: a substantial wing of the Maga movement is hostile to Israel. (This week,Marjorie Taylor Greene became the first US lawmaker to accuse the country of genocide.) And Trump himself does not entirely share Netanyahu’s sweeping disregard for international opinion. He disdains it, but he also seeks its approval: he wants that Nobel prize.Steadily, the Israeli public is coming to see the price of the pariah status that Netanyahu has all but cultivated. A small portent is contained in thetrouble currently greeting Israeli tourists in Greece. That may be the best way to understand the vehemence with which Israeli officials sought to dismiss Starmer et al this week, insisting in loud, furious statements that they weren’t bothered at all. Increasing numbers of Israelis know they do not have the luxury of being Millwall: maybe no one likes them – but quite a lot of them care.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Set in the Spanish coastal city of Almería, the book – which has now been made into a film starring Sex Education’s Emma Mackey – is a sun-drenched unravelling of a daughter tethered to her ailing mother.Hot Milk fits into a growing canon of literature exploring the absent, or fading, or otherwise inaccessible mother – stories in which the maternal figure is pulled to the edge of the frame, so that the daughter can take centre stage. Books such asGwendoline Riley’s My PhantomsandFirst Love, both featuring mother-daughter relationships marked by emotional distance and strained communication.OrThe Lost DaughterbyElena Ferrante, where the protagonist, Leda, is both unseen daughter and deserting mother, a collision that unleashes emotional chaos.That writers slip into the narrative reflex of the mother as too powerful or too centralto allow for a character’s development is revealing. Space must be cleared for the daughter to suffer, individuate and grow. Yet, these novels also show that we never fully cast our mother out. She remains at the edges of our identity, both threat to the self and origin.Hot Milk – adapted for film by Rebecca Lenkiewicz and released in the UK last month – follows Sofia and her mother, Rose, as they travel to Spain in search of a cure for Rose’s unexplained paralysis.In the novel, Sofia seems to inherit her mother’s pain: “Sometimes, I find myself limping,” she says. “It’s as if my body remembers the way I walk with my mother.” She experiences psychosomatic symptoms mirroring her mother’s sickness, and must break free from her mother’s feigned helplessness in order to discover her own body, her own desires.View image in fullscreenBoth unseen daughter and deserting mother ... Olivia Colman in the film adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s The Lost Daughter.Photograph: Yannis Drakoulidis/NetflixBut what is most poignant is that Levy, whose works refuse sentimental arcs, shows us that this separation isn’t always clean cut. It can sometimes be a feverish drift. Sofia’s freedom is not triumphant, but strange and unstable. Levy doesn’t promise that separation brings clarity, rather she suggests it may bring vertigo. And few stories succeed in making this psychological umbilical cord feel more real.In my own novel Selfish Girls, we see three women trying to be daughters but also yearning to be free. To adequately write about this tension, I first needed to interrogate why the absence of the mother makes for such compelling storytelling. Why do we keep circling it, again and again? The opacity comes from cultural contradiction: motherhood is revered as sacred and essential, and yet mothers themselves are often invisible or misunderstood. A mother will always be defined by her absence because she will never fully be there – or never as youneedher to be. Then there’s the strange ache of it: that in her presence, our mother remains unknowable. She is the most familiar stranger we’ll ever love, and that is narrative gold. “The hardest things to talk about are the ones we ourselves can’t understand,” writes Ferrante inThe Lost Daughter. Subtext is the pressure point where literary complexity builds: “Who was my mother, really?” becomes the story engine.My own mother was this impenetrable mystery I needed to let go of in order to become myself, but she was also someone so close, whose laugh carried through my own, whose image I caught glimpses of in my own reflection. In some sense, my novel is a reckoning of wanting to truly understand her at the same time as I am detaching, getting married, assuming my own family unit and moving to another country, putting an ocean between us. Idolising and rejecting her all at once. Perhaps there is ambivalence and guilt for stepping away, tangled with the quieter grief and shame of feeling I’d been left long before. Maybe the act of writing offers a way back into those unknowns of deep love and resentment, trying to shape them into something I could live with – a story of my own, without losing the parts of my mother that still mattered.My own mother was this impenetrable mystery I needed to let go of in order to become myselfRiley captures this bind with razor-sharp realism and cool, clipped colloquialism in First Love. Neve receives a text from her mother: “CUT ALL MY HAIR OFF DO YOU WANT BOBBLES AND BRUSHES ETC. MUM.” It has to be wheedled out of her that she is, in fact, going through a tough time having broken up with her boyfriend. With pitch-perfect humour, Riley captures the apparent availability of the mother against a background of emotional absence. Neve recalls visits or phone calls with her mother characterised by awkwardness and superficiality.The protagonist in My Phantoms echoes this: “She asked questions she didn’t want answers to, and gave answers no one had asked for”. For Riley, the maternal relationship is a tug-of-war between performance and authenticity. The mother’s presence feels like a performance of motherhood only – all form, no feeling – leaving the daughters deeply isolated in their company. You see, it is not enough for our mother to simply be a mother; she must embody the right kind of motherhood.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

To leave room, in other words, to disappear.” To withdraw just enough so the child can emerge as a self.Levy, Riley and Ferrante are trying to do on paper what we can never quite do in life: allow the mother to live fully inside our skin as a presence absorbed. In Hot Milk, Levy doesn’t resolve the mother-daughter bind, she lets it linger in the body – a felt, inescapable inheritance. Perhaps these stories don’t offer catharsis, but do something braver: let the mother remain inside the daughter, not as obstacle or ideal, but metabolised as a presence the self must grow around.Selfish Girls is published by Hodder & StoughtonExplore more on these topicsBooksDeborah LevyElena FerranteThe Lost DaughterOlivia ColmanGwendoline RileyParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Potentially a lot, if you are launching a movement with ambitions “to shape something truly transformative” in British politics.That’s the challenge facingJeremy CorbynandZarah Sultana, the former Labour MPs who announced plans last month, if not in themost coordinatedfashion, to launcha leftwing political party. More than 600,000 people have alreadysigned up for updateson the new group, which will be called … what?“The members will get to choose,” Sultana said earlier this week, as a consultation on the subject closed. It will not be called Your Party, however, despite having launched on a website with preciselythat name. Herown preferenceis the Left Party, “because that’s what it says on the tin … We’ll obviously put that to the members and we’ll see what we get”.The fact that so many have already signed up to a nameless project might suggest that what it is eventually called matters less than the involvement of Corbyn, the still totemic (to some) former Labour leader, and Sultana, an effective andsavvy digital communicator.Despite the chaos of its launch, Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s new party has struck a nerve | Andy BeckettRead moreBut, say political insiders, history shows how parties’ fortunes can be shaped by the names they adopt, both good and bad. For everyEn Marche!(Forward!), the French centrist movement that propelled Emmanuel Macron to his country’s presidency, there is a Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance party, launched in 2015 and inevitablyknown as CCRAPuntil its name was hastily re-jumbled.Or take the short-lived alliance of disaffected centrist Labour MPs and Tories that in 2019 called itself the Independent Group, then TIG, then Change UK before being forced by a branding dispute to settle on theIndependent Group for Change. Witheven their own candidatesdismissing their “terrible name”, they made little electoral impact and quickly folded.On the other hand, the body once known as the Brexit party now claims 29% opinion poll support, afterrebranding in 2020as Reform UK. In the party-naming fashion stakes, indeed, long strings of descriptors are out of vogue these days, while dynamic slogans or abstract verbs (Forza Italia!Propel!Aspire!) are very much in.“I think what you call yourself is really important, it’s one of the most profound calling cards of what you offer,” saysRohan McWilliam, a professor of modern history at Anglia Ruskin University and director of its Labour History Research Unit.He cites the example of Tony Blair’s mid-90s rebrand of “New” Labour, which he says the defeated Conservative party came to see as the single most important reason for the party’s huge victory in 1997. “Their conclusion was they had been defeated because Labour used one word and one word alone, and that was ‘New’. Just that word alone spoke volumes.”John McTernan, formerly a member of Blair’s core Downing Street team and now a political strategist, agrees about the name’s impact. “The important thing was that calling yourself New Labour created a category called old Labour. It created what you were against – and that’s a very important thing in politics. That gave us the ability to have a clean break with the past, so we could say: ‘No, no, that’s old Labour.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gareth Morgan, an executive director overseeing government relations at the brand consultancyCavendish, urges clarity above all. “I think it’s always useful to have a name which conveys the purpose to people who check in with politics for 10 minutes each week, max. The best name is one where, just by reading it, I understand what you’re for and what you’re about.”Chris Bruni-Lowe, a campaigns strategist whose bookEight Words That Changed the Worldexamines which political words resonate, says: “A party name or slogan should be emotionally intelligible to everyday people, not just to political insiders. Words that sound elitist or academic are the least likely to work. New political parties often fail unless they define themselves clearly and simply.”Bruni-Lowe has advised parties across the political spectrum. “The most successful parties have a name and slogan that succeeded because it was immediately clear what it stood for,” he says.Over to you, Corbyn, Sultana – and your many thousands of supporters.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsJeremy CorbynZarah SultananewsShareReuse this content"

My daughter screamed, ‘Mummy!’Rachel HawkinsFri 1 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 12.07 EDTShareOne morning in 2018, my husband Reuben told me about a nightmare he’d had the previous night. He’d been driving over the Hewitt Avenue Trestle, a bridge near our house in Everett, Washington in the US, crashed through the barriers into the estuary below, and had to decide which of our two children to save.Two weeks later, I was getting Talia, then three, and Weston, 10 months, dressed, fed and out of the door to take them to preschool on my way to work.It was a route we’d taken a hundred times before. I was chatting to Reuben on speakerphone with both children in the back, when I smelled something odd, like plastic melting.I mentioned it to Reuben, but neither of us thought anything of it. There are industrial buildings nearby, so I assumed it was coming from one of them.A minute later, and no longer on the phone, I drove on to the bridge my husband had dreamed about, which was busy with rush-hour traffic. That’s when I saw the word “STOP” flash across my dashboard.Before I even had the chance to register it, I saw smoke rising from the bonnet of the car. I knew I needed to pull over, but the bridge, which is 2.5 miles long, didn’t have a hard shoulder. I decided it was safest to get across it and then stop the car.The smoke coming out of the bonnet was so thick I couldn’t see the road ahead. I pulled over and acted on pure instinctGripping the steering wheel, I put my foot down, but within seconds the smoke was so thick I could no longer see the road ahead. With cars flying past me, I managed to pull over to the side of the road.At this point, I was really distressed. I called the American Automobile Association (AAA), but, as if my luck wasn’t bad enough, my membership had expired. As I was talking to the operator, I saw flames through the windshield – the bonnet was on fire.Terrified, and certain the car was about to explode, I yelled that my car was on fire. Acting on pure instinct, I jumped out, opened the door behind me, and unclipped Weston’s car seat.I could hear the woman from the AAA shouting at me to call 911 as cars and lorries thundered past, just inches away. For a split second I froze. Was it safe to put Weston down on the road while I grabbed Talia? Could I run to the end of the bridge with them both in my arms?Just then, as I was almost overwhelmed with fear, an arm appeared. I looked up into the face of a man who said, “It’s OK, mama”, took Westonfrom my hands and went to his car, which was just behind me.I dashed round to Talia’s door, opening it to see flames inside, and spreading fast. She looked at me in terror and screamed, “Mummy!” Within a second, I had her in my arms, running back to the man’s car. As we zoomed off, I looked over my shoulder and saw flames shooting into the sky. Talia was sobbing into my chest.Unable to think clearly, I didn’t call 911 or Reuben, I just asked for us to be dropped at a nearby car dealership. I thanked my heroic rescuer and hugged him goodbye, only later realising that I didn’t even get his name.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He’s a funny guy, and, as I fell into his arms, weeping, he quipped: “Sorry I’m late. There was some big fire on the road.”I called Reuben on the way to my parents’ house. He was devastated, repeatedly apologising for not knowing the smell was something serious. I tried to reassure him: I hadn’t known, either.Seeing the burnt-out car arrive later that day before it was scrapped was awful. I felt sick at the thought of what might have happened if I hadn’t got the children out when I did.While Weston appeared unaffected throughout, and Talia was back to her happy self within hours, I struggled. I had awful dreams where I endlessly relived it. When driving our new car, I’d obsessively open the windows at the slightest smell, convinced it was on fire.A session of EMDR [eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing] therapy helped a lot. I was even able to drive across the Trestle and stay calm.We never found out what caused the fire. Thankfully, the children have no memory of that day now. And when they moan that Mummy doesn’t do this or that, I remind them that I entered a burning car for them – and I’d do it again in a heartbeat.As told to Kate GrahamDo you have an experience to share?

The target has not been hit since 2015, and in May just 61% were treated on time.Nine out of 10 nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland reject pay awardRead moreIn a further sign of how difficult it will be to meet that target, the data shows that a third of the 3 million unseen patients – 1 million people – have already waited more than 18 weeks without receiving any care.It is the first time the phenomenon of “unseen patients” has emerged as part of the huge challenge facing the government in its drive to “get the NHS back on its feet”. Until now debate around the NHS backlog has focused on the number of treatments patients are due to receive and how many are waiting – currently 7.36m and 6.23m respectively.“If accurate, 3 million people are trapped in an invisible waiting list crisis, stuck without basic diagnostic tests of first appointments while their conditions worsen,” said Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association.“The scale is staggering, as nearly half of all patients on a waiting list haven’t been seen by anyone. That’s not a healthcare service; that’s a breakdown.“These aren’t just statistics. They’re people checking their phones daily for hospital calls that never come, unable to plan their lives while their symptoms deteriorate.”The figures have been collated and analysed by the health data specialistMBI Health, which helps dozens of NHS trusts improve their treatment waiting times. It has shared its findings with the Guardian.Barry Mulholland, the firm’s founder and a former NHS manager, said the health service should see the waiting list as “a frontlog, not a backlog”, because so many people had not had their “first clinical contact” after joining it. In recent years ministers and NHS bosses have made reducing the number of people waiting 12 or 18 months for care their priority.“There are so many people who have already waited so long without seeing anyone – 3 million unseen patients who haven’t had their first contact.“Unless that’s dealt with, you will never achieve that target of seeing and treating patients within 18 weeks.“From the government’s point of view, the pledge to get back to 18 weeks by 2029 will be really hard to accomplish if this huge group of patients isn’t seen more quickly.”“We’ll never clear the waiting list if we don’t fix the point where patients enter the system, and long delays begin,” he added.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer has pledged that 92% of patients will be treated within 18 weeks of referral by 2029, and in May just 61% were treated on time.Photograph: Toby Melville/PA MediaNHS England acknowledged the vast number of people who had had no NHS care since joining the waiting list.

Behind every one of these numbers is a person in pain, anxious about their health, and desperately waiting for their first contact from a clinician.“This isn’t a problem that appeared overnight; it’s the direct result of the Conservative party mismanaging our NHS for years. It is unacceptable that millions of people are still being left in a state of limbo, while their conditions potentially worsen.”Ministers would only “fix” the NHS if they overhauled social care to unblock jammed-up hospitals, she added.MBI’s analysis also found that the medical specialities with the largest number of unseen patients were ear, nose and throat care, orthopaedics, eye care, gastroenterology and gynaecology. Between 67% and 75% of those waiting lists are made up of such patients, Mulholland added.The Department ofHealthand Social Care did not comment on the 3 million unseen patients.A spokesperson said only that: “Thanks to this government’s record investment, reforms and the hard work of NHS staff, we’ve cut the waiting list by over 260,000 since July 2024, which also fell for the first time in 17 years in April and May outside the pandemic. On top of this, we have also delivered 4.6m appointments – more than double the 2m we promised.“This government is delivering the fundamental reform needed to turn our NHS around, and our 10-year health plan will build on this progress, to ensure we meet our target that 92% of patients wait no longer than 18 weeks for treatment by March 2029.”Mulholland concluded: “If we refocus on access to the first contact for those patients in limbo – and ensure high-quality data is captured – we can turn the tide, bringing down the elective list and improving the experience of people waiting for treatment.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthLabourEnglandHealth policyPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

I know the country very well, I have a lot of family there, and I’m very interested in what happens there.“But home is where my now family is, and my now family is my children, it’s my husband and my brother and his children, in-laws. The Conservative party is very much part of my family, my extended family, I call it.”In 1980 Badenoch was among the last people to automatically receive British citizenship because she was born in the UK. Margaret Thatcher abolished birthright citizenship the following year.“Finding out that I did have that British citizenship was a marvel to so many of my contemporaries, so many of my peers,” she said.“I think the reason that I came back here was actually a very sad one, and it was that my parents thought: ‘There is no future for you in this country.’” She recalled “never quite feeling that I belonged there”.The future Tory leader moved back to the UK aged 16 to live with a friend of her mother because of the worsening political and economic situation in Nigeria, and to study for her A-levels.When Badenoch’s father, Femi Adegoke, who was a doctor, died in Nigeria in 2022 she obtained a visa to travel there, which she described as a “big fandango”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are determined to do everything we can to stop them – wherever they operate.”The change will also make it a crime to post online content that encourages someone to break UK immigration law in exchange for money.Rob Jones, the director general for operations at the NationalCrimeAgency (NCA), said: “We know many of the people-smuggling networks risking lives transporting people to the UK promote their services to migrants using social media. The majority of migrants arriving in the UK will have engaged with smugglers in this way.”The NCA has taken action against organised crime groups using social media to promote crossings, including a south Wales-based gang convicted in November 2024 after smuggling thousands of people across Europe.The gang used social media videos posted by people who had made successful crossings to promote the service.Another networkoperated bythe Preston-based smuggler Amanj Hasan Zada, who was later jailed for 17 years, also posted videos of people thanking Zada for helping them.There have been cases of Albanian people smugglers who have used social media to promote £12,000 “package deals” to get to the UK including accommodation and employment, which will also fall under the scope of the new law.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumCrimeMigrationHome OfficeYvette CooperSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

We want to help them live. We want to get people fed. It is something that should have happened long time ago.”It remains unclear whether Trump intends to double down on an expansion of the GHF operations or envisages a new way of doing things.Hours after Witkoff’s visit to the site in Rafah, Palestinian medics said they received the bodies of 13 people shot dead by Israeli forces while trying to get aid, including near the site that US officials visited. GHF denied anyone was killed at their sites on Friday.Witkoff visited as Human Rights Watch described the sites run by the GHF as “death traps” which had become the scene of regular “bloodbaths”. The UN has said that Israeli forces have killed almost 900 Palestinians who were attempting to reach the sites.View image in fullscreenPhotograph handed out from the US embassy in Jerusalem shows the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee (third left) and Witkoff (centre, seated) visiting a GHF site in Gaza.Photograph: David Azagury/US embassy in Jerusalem/AFP/Getty ImagesBelkis Wille, the associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch, said on Friday: “US-backed Israeli forces and private contractors have put in place a flawed, militarised aid distribution system that has turned aid distributions into regular bloodbaths.”Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.She added: “Israeli forces are not onlydeliberately starving Palestiniancivilians, but they are now gunning them down almost every day as they desperately seek food for their families.”The mathematics of starvation: how Israel caused a famine in GazaRead moreThe UN said on Friday that Israeli forces had killed 1,353 Palestinians who were waiting for food – 859 around GHF sites and another 514 along the route of UN aid convoys.The health ministry in Gaza said that 83 people had been killed and 554 wounded by IDF fire in the territory in the past 24 hours.According to the announcement, 53 were killed and more than 400 were wounded while seeking humanitarian aid.A UN spokesperson said Israeli policies had led to the widespread desperation in Gaza that meant arriving UN trucks were overwhelmed and stripped before they could reach warehouses.The UN says longstanding Israeli restrictions on the entry of aid has created an unpredictable environment, and that means, while a pause in fighting might allow more aid in, Palestinians are not confident aid will reach them.Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha), said: “This has resulted in many of our convoys offloaded directly by starving, desperate people as they continue to face deep levels of hunger and are struggling to feed their families. The only way to reach a level of confidence is by having a sustained flow of aid over a period of time.”While a number of countries have resumed airdrops of aid into Gaza in recent days, aid experts have warned that the amount of food that can be dropped by air is insufficient to counter starvation inside the Palestinian territory.GraphOn Friday, Hamas released a brief video of an emaciated and bearded Israeli hostage held in a narrow concrete tunnel in Gaza. Israeli media identified as Evyatar David, who was seized at the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023.Of the 251 hostages taken during the Hamas attack, 49 are still being held in Gaza, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.Israeli officials have said that if there is no progress in the coming days on a deal with Hamas to release the hostages, Israel will expand its operations in Gaza.International humanitarian agencies and experts say that famine has gripped Gaza after Israel blocked food from entering the territory for two and a half months starting in March.Since it eased the blockade in late May, Israel has only allowed in a trickle of aid trucks for the UN, about 70 a day on average, according to Israel’s own figures. That is far below the 500-600 trucks a day that UN agencies say are needed – the amount that entered during a six-week ceasefire earlier this year.While Netanyahu and other officials have claimed that there is “no hunger in Gaza” or that it is the fault of Hamas looting or the UN’s failings, incontrovertible evidence has been offered by the UN’s food security monitor of the spread of famine amid Israel’s choking of the entry of aid, a policy critics say amounts to the crime of using starvation as a weapon.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelUS foreign policyHumanitarian responseMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesShareReuse this content"

She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.”McEntarfer was contacted for comment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) confirmed in a brief statement that she had been dismissed. William Wiatrowski, the agency’s deputy commissioner, will serve as acting commissioner.Trump’s abrupt announcement came as administration officials scrambled to explain a lackluster employment report. Not only did jobs growth fail to meet expectations in July, but previous estimates for May and June were revised significantly lower.a graph of jobs growth numbersThe president was promptly accused of trying to hide accurate statistics. “Trump is firing the messenger because he doesn’t seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he’s damaged the economy,” said Lily Roberts, managing director for inclusive growth at the Center for American Progress, a thinktank, said.“Politicizing our country’s collection of data on what’s going on in the economy … will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job,” added Roberts. “Borrowing from the authoritarian playbook fuels more uncertainty that will cost Americans for years to come.”Paul Schroeder, executive director of the Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics, described the president’s allegation as “very damaging and outrageous”, adding: “Not only does it undermine the integrity of federal economic statistics but it also politicizes data which need to remain independent and trustworthy. This action is a grave error by the administration and one that will have ramifications for years to come.”McEntarfer is a widely respected economist and veteran employee of the federal government.

The charges relate to three children at the rural camp in the village of Stathern, Leicestershire police said on Friday.Police launched an investigation after children attending the camp at Stathern Lodge, near Melton, became unwell.Emergency services attended the scene and eight children, all boys aged between eight and 11, along with one adult, were taken to hospital as a precaution. All of the patients have subsequently been discharged.Ruben has been remanded into custody and will appear at Leicester magistrates court on Saturday.Janine McKinney, chief crown prosecutor for CPS East Midlands, said: “The Crown Prosecution Service has authorised the prosecution of a 76-year-old man with child cruelty offences following a police investigation into a summer camp held at Stathern Lodge, Leicestershire.“This decision has been made after reviewing a file of evidence from Leicestershire police.“Jonathon Ruben will be charged with three offences of wilful ill treatment of a child relating to three boys. He will appear at Leicester magistrates court on Saturday 2 August.“This has been an extremely upsetting and shocking moment for the community, and especially for the children and parents most directly affected.“We would like to remind all concerned that there are now active criminal proceedings against Mr Ruben and he has the right to a fair trial. There must be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online that may in any way prejudice these proceedings.”Leicestershire police had originally said the incident happened on Monday, before amending it to Sunday, and it remains unclear whether officers only responded on Monday and whether that is why the force has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).The force said in a statement: “The owners and operators of Stathern Lodge are independent from those people who use or hire the lodge and are not connected to the incident.”The investigation is being led by the East Midlands special operations unit’s major incident team.DI Neil Holden, the senior investigating officer, said: “We understand the concern this incident will have caused to parents, guardians and the surrounding community.”He added: “This is a complex and sensitive investigation and we will continue to provide updates to both parents and guardians and the public as and when we can.”The IOPC said: “Our assessment team has examined all available evidence and concluded the matter should be independently investigated by the IOPC.“The investigation will look at whether there were any breaches of professional behaviour – namely a failure to carry out duties and responsibilities – that resulted in a delay in Leicestershire police’s response to what was later declared a critical incident.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The response was a thumbs up emoji from the retired businessman from Newcastle.But Armstrong, speaking by his Bentley car outside his whitewashed villa, wearing only his underpants, said he had nothing to hide.“I did not know he is here,” Armstrong said. “Nobody’s told me that. The girl I spoke to, she said: ‘No, he’s in mainlandSpain.’ Maybe when he comes out here, he might see me once, maybe twice, no more than twice.”Tenerife was Tommy Robinson’s safe place, said Nick Lowles, a biographer of the far-right activist.View image in fullscreenCalling at Villa Elite in Costa Adeje, where Robinson is known to have stayed previously.Photograph: Phil Crean/The GuardianIt was where he ran to in 2020 as “his life was spiralling out of control” before a very expensive libel trial over his false claims against a 15-year-old Syrian refugee.The address he gave to court then was a 10-bedroom villa in the south of the island, described as a “private haven of prestige”.The largest Canary island emerged again this week to be Robinson’s bolthole of choice in a moment of peril, although friends insist there was nothing untoward about the timing of his trip.Robinson had been filmed by a fellow passenger getting on to a shuttle bus at Tenerife South airport after taking the 5.55am Ryanair flight from Stansted on Tuesday.View image in fullscreenFriends of Tommy Robinson insisted there was nothing untoward about his trip to Tenerife.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAMobile phone footage had spread on social media of Robinson pacing close to a prone body at London St Pancras station. He is heard telling concerned onlookers: “You saw him, he came at me.”The Met police issued a statement saying they wished to question a 42-year-old man, understood to be Robinson, over an alleged assault the previous evening. The injured man was discharged from hospital on Wednesday.Speaking on Friday, Armstrong said he had first met Robinson “five or six years” ago at a restaurant through “a mate of mine”.The friend in question was Lutz Bachmann, the leader of the Patriotische Europäer gegen die Islamisierung des Abendlandes (Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, or Pegida movement), a far-right German political organisation that hit the headlines a decade ago after its mass marches in Dresden.Bachmann has 22 convictions in Germany, including for drug trafficking, tax evasion and child support offences.He has called African refugees “gangs of rapists” and “throat cutters”. He was banned from entering the UK in 2018 on the grounds that his presence was “not conducive to the public good”.Bachmann moved to Tenerife eight years ago and, with Armstrong, they appear to have formed something of a support network.In his biography of Robinson, Lowles wrote that it was Armstrong who helped fund a campaign bus in 2019 during his failed attempt to get a seat in the European parliament.View image in fullscreenThe Hemingway cafe in Costa Adeje, a favourite  breakfast spot for Robinson.Photograph: Phil Crean/The GuardianArmstrong said the media told lies about Robinson, but then his own record is patchy.He was convicted of printing money “in the 70s, 80s”, he confirmed. He also served two months in HMP Brixton after being convicted at Southwark crown court in 2000 for having control of counterfeit share certificates for blue chip UK companies and drafts in the name of an international bank.“I could have appealed that and got out of it,” Armstrong said. Not that prison proved a chore. “Loved it,” he said, “made some lovely friends there. But getting back to Tommy, I swear to God I didn’t know he was here.”Armstrong said he usually stayed in a “posh hotel” on the coast and not with him, and would work out at a gym in a shopping mall. Bachmann had not seen Robinson either, he further claimed.“I spoke to him yesterday and he said he hadn’t,” he said. “I said: ‘Is Tommy over?’ And he said: ‘He’s not.’ He would tell me. We are mates. Then I heard from somebody else that he is on mainland Spain. It’s a mystery to me”.Explore more on these topicsTommy RobinsonFar rightSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Since the truce both sides have accused each other ofviolating it, while online, public distrust is being fuelled by a bitter confluence of disinformation, threats and nationalism.Dowsawan Vanthong, 50, who is volunteering at a temple in Surin, northeastern Thailand, that is hosting evacuated people, worries that even if calm prevails and the disputed border eventually reopens, relations won’t be the same.“For me, I can make a distinction and separate normal Cambodians [from the government or military]… But I’m not sure if everyone could do this, especially people in the areas that were most affected,” she says.At least 43 people were killed on either side of the border in the clashes, the worst to grip the two nations in more than a decade.The bitter feud fuelling the border dispute between Thailand and CambodiaRead moreIn normal times, residents would regularly cross the 800km border that separates the two countries, going back and forth for trade and work, school or healthcare. Before the conflict started, more than 520,000 Cambodians worked acrossThailand, often in low-paid jobs in agriculture, construction, fishing and manufacturing.But the border is now almost entirely shut, though Cambodians living in Thailand can return home. Thousands have queued up to do so, worried about rising vitriol in Thailand.Da, who works as a cleaner and asked for her real name not to be published due to the tensions, says she has to stay in Thailand for economic reasons and to pay off debts, but she feels still feels uneasy about the decision. “The kids saw on social media that a lot of Cambodians are going back home, so they wanted to as well,” she says.Social media commentaries have become increasingly incendiary and, at times, violent.In a viral TikTok clip, a Thai man appears to instruct young Cambodians to tell Hun Sen - the former Cambodian leader who remains extremely powerful – not to attack Thai people. When one of the group smiles, the man slaps him on camera. Hun Sen later shared the video on his Facebook page, warning Cambodians in Thailand to stay safe.Another video, shared widely online, apparently shows a group of Thai people beating up a man who is reportedly a Cambodian national.When two Cambodian women posted videos stamping on the Thai flag, part of a new social media trend, people demanded their deportation.Thai authorities have urged young people and social media influencers against inciting violence, but the bitterness has continued to be shared online.The leaked phone call that could ring the changes for one of Thailand’s most powerful dynastiesRead moreThe South-east Asian neighbours have a long history of rivalry, especially arguments over the roots of their shared heritage. In 2003, when false rumours that a Thai soap opera actor had suggested Angkor Wat, a Unesco world heritage site, belonged to Thailand,riots erupted in Phnom Penh, and the Thai embassy set on fire.Diplomatic rows and social media storms have broken out periodically since. Two years ago, Thailand boycotted a kickboxing event at the South-East Asian Games in Cambodia after the discipline was called Kun Khmer rather than Thailand’s name for the sport, Muay Thai. Even well-meaning posts can spiral into online wars. The UK ambassador to Cambodia Dominic Williams inadvertently created a social media furore in 2023 when he posted a picture of some sweet treats on social media, captioned “Khmer dessert”. Thai people responded with a flood of angry comments claiming the snacks were in fact Thai.Social media, far more prevalent than the last time the border dispute erupted in 2008 and 2011, has inflamed tensions.Some have pushed back. A major hospital in Ubon Ratchathani province was forced to backtrack after it suspended services for new Cambodian patients and announced it would be strictly “zoning” existing Cambodian patients due to the recent fighting. Critics pointed out the policy was discriminatory. But online others supported the hospital. “Shall we help them get better so they can shoot at us again?” wrote one commentator.The public mood in Thailand – and pressure for Thai authorities to seek responsibility for Cambodian attacks on Thai civilians – could threaten the fragile ceasefire.Ken Lohatepanont, a political analyst in Thailand, says the ceasefire will probably hold for now, but the prospects in the medium and long term are less clear. “Thailand and Cambodia are still going to have a lot of border issues to resolve, because none of the core points of contention have actually been discussed so far,” he said.Both Thailand and Cambodia still insist on usingdifferent maps to demarcate the border.Da, who lives far from the border, in Rayong province, is mostly staying at home, going out only to buy food and work. “In my opinion, both sides have done things wrong – they need to find a way to speak peacefully,” she says. “I want the situation to go back to normal, to open the border gates so that Thai and Cambodian people can come together again.”Explore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m looking for getting people [in Gaza] fed right now.”Within 36 hours, after an emergency meeting of his cabinet, the prime minister hadset out a planto revive fading hopes of a two-state solution – and recognise Palestine by the end of September.It is a historic shift in the position of the UK government and its efforts to bring peace to a region itruled through an international mandatefrom 1922 to 1948. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, told a UN conference on Monday that “Britain bears a special burden of responsibility”.Starmer ‘listening to hostages’ but intends to stick to Palestine statehood planRead moreUnder the new policy – which the Guardian understands was largely drafted byJonathan Powell, the national security adviser– the UK will recognise Palestine unless Israel meets certain conditions including agreeing a ceasefire in Gaza and reviving the prospect of a two-state solution.In private, senior government figures agree that this commitment can lead only to recognition. “The reality is unless the Netanyahu government falls in the next six to eight weeks or makes an 180 degree U-turn, the only outcome of this is the UK recognising the state of Palestine,” one government source said. If Israel does meet the conditions, it will have embarked on a path towards Palestinian statehood itself.Ministers stress that recognition wasa Labour manifesto promiseand therefore always something they were committed to doing before the next election. But over the past fortnight, Starmer came under heavy pressure on the domestic and international stage to move faster amid a global outcry over thehorrific scenes of starvation in Gaza caused by Israel’s blockade on aid.View image in fullscreenA protester holds a placard with a message for Keir Starmer.Photograph: Rhianna Chadwick/AFP/Getty ImagesEmmanuel Macron, the French president, had for months been lobbying the UK and other countries tojoin a push for Palestinian recognition at a high-level UN conference in New York, which had been due to take place in June but was postponed by the outbreak of war between Israel and Iran.Three weeks ago, the UN conference was rescheduled for 28 and 29 July as its joint hosts, France and Saudi Arabia, sought to keep momentum building. Four days before foreign ministers were due to gather in New York, Macron announced that France intended torecognise a Palestinian state at the UN general assemblyin September.Meanwhile in the UK, ministers’ horror at the deteriorating situation in Gaza was mounting. There was a growing realisation inside government that the prospect of a two-state solution wasfast diminishingand at risk of being buried for good by Netanyahu. In an unusual intervention on 22 July, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, told the Commons that he supported recognising “the state of Palestine while there is a state of Palestine left to recognise”.The Guardian revealed the extent of cabinet pressure that week – Streeting, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, and Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary,had all pushed for Palestinian statehoodduring cabinet meetings. Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, and Yvette Cooper, the home secretary,believed the UK should act alongside France. An open letter on 25 July backing recognition was signed by more than 200 MPs, including more than a third of Labour ones.That Friday evening, Starmer, who had just concluded a call with Macron and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, bid for time. Downing Street was preparing for a high-stakes summit with Trump, who was en route to Scotland on Air Force One for a private visit to his golf resorts.“There was a concern within No 10 that we needed to make sure that any decision with regards to recognition would not have a negative impact on that US relationship,” a government source said. At about the same time, it was decided that Lammy would attend the French-Saudi UN summit, rather than send a more junior representative.With Lammy en route to New York, Starmer and his wife, Victoria, arrived in Turnberry on Monday morning and were greeted by Trump on the steps of his resort. In an impromptu back and forth with reporters outside, Trump reacted to the suggestion that the UK could recognise Palestine with a rhetorical shrug. “That was a green light,” the same source said.View image in fullscreenTrump and Starmer in Scotland. At the meeting, Trump for the first time acknowledged that there was ‘real starvation’ in Gaza.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesTrump also, for the first time,acknowledged that there was “real starvation” in Gazaand dismissed denials from Netanyahu, urging him to let “every ounce of food” in. After the meeting, No 10 sources emphasised the significance of the president’s language.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then Starmer and Lammy – dialling in from New York – presented ministers with the policy over the course of a 90-minute cabinet meeting before announcing it publicly.The decision to make statehood conditional on Israel’s actions quickly came under fire from all sides. The Green party and Jeremy Corbyn attacked ministers for turning Palestinians’ right to recognition into a “bargaining chip”. Emily Damari, a British citizen who was held hostage by Hamas for more than 15 months,accused Starmer of “moral failure”and “rewarding terror”. A group of 40 peers warned that ministersrisked breaking international lawbecause Palestine has no defined borders or single functioning government.Even government figures concede that the policy – which ministers have struggled to communicate on the airwaves – is convoluted, but they argue that the semantics won’t matter once the UK recognises a Palestinian state alongside several of its allies next month.If the UK recognises Palestine does it risk breaking international law?Read moreCrucially, Trump’s indifferent stance appears to be holding. Asked by reporters on his way home from Scotland about Starmer’s move,the president was more critical: “We never did discuss it,” he said. “You’re rewarding Hamas if you do that. I don’t think they should be rewarded”. He left his criticism there.Trump reserved harsher words forCanada’s move towards recognition– saying it “will make it very hard for us to make a trade deal” – but later conceded that it was “not a dealbreaker”. “I didn’t like what they said, but you know that’s their opinion,” he told reporters on Thursday.The US looks increasingly isolated as more of its allies prepare to join the push in September. Australia, New Zealand, Finland and Portugal all signed a letter in support of recognition at the UN summit. A parallel joint statement from Arab countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt condemning Hamas and calling on it to lay down arms is seen as highly significant.But there is little hope for a ceasefire while Hamas torpedoes talks and the humanitarian situation inGazaremains dire as Israel maintains its blockade. UK officials say that while David Cameron was foreign secretary, the aim was for 200 trucks of aid to enter Gaza through Jordan every day. They are now expecting just 150 trucks to enter this entire week.Over the coming days, ministers’ focus will be on efforts to get more aid into the territory and transport severely injured children to the UK for treatment. Meanwhile, all eyes were on Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff ashe visited US-funded aid delivery points in Gazaon Friday.“If the government got the American president into a place where he’s at least not against [recognition], that’s quite a shift,” said Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs committee. “If we’re going to get the international community to agree to a plan, there’s no way we’re going to get anywhere without Trump’s buy-in.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsGazaPalestinian territoriesKeir StarmerMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And he came back and said he would cost us around £4m, but he was very good. So I told the people at Crystal Palace.”Warnock resists identifying Steve Parish, Palace’s chairman, by name for he is deep in a story that illustrates how data analytics is not always infallible. “He asked for 24 hours and went to the data people. The next day he said: ‘We don’t want to go ahead.’ I asked him why and he said they don’t think he’s quick enough. I said: ‘He might not look quick enough, but he’s in second gear in Scotland. If he had to sprint, he’d sprint.’”I already know Warnock is remembering how he missed signing Virgil van Dijk and, as we’re having an enjoyable knockabout, I ask if even a great player such as Franz Beckenbauer might have been dismissed by the stats men. The German sweeper had pace and tenacity, but his regal vision meant he could intercept a pass without needing to produce a crunching tackle. “Correct,” Warnock replies. “Beckenbauer would never have got on, would he, with the data? He’d have been playing Sunday league, Beckenbauer.“So we didn’t sign Van Dijk. He went to Southampton [for £13m]. I was with Cardiff a few years later, when we got to the Premier League, andI came up against him at Liverpool[who signed Van Dijk for £75m]. He came up and said: ‘Mr Warnock, you could have signed me’. I swore and said: ‘I bet you were glad that you were too slow for me.’ We had a laugh together.”“It just shows you. They can sign these great players on a computer but I was at Middlesbrough and they said they’d got a left-back for me,” Warnock goes on. “I watched him for five minutes and said: ‘He can’t defend. I don’t want him.’ They said: ‘But his stats show he’s got the most tackles, the most headers.’ I said: ‘Are you listening? He can’t defend.’ Managers now are more or less coaches and they’re letting the recruitment team pick the players. But the data people don’t see the character of the person or other aspects of his game.”View image in fullscreenWarnock photographed for the Guardian when manager at QPR in 2011. ‘I got Cardiff in the Premier League. Look where they are now.’Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianA freewheeling conversation with Warnock moves from memories of drinking pink champagne with Brian Clough to a bitter fallout with Sir Alex Ferguson. It includes recollections of eight promotions, five relegations, and a lot of pride. “I survived 1,627 games,” Warnock says. “When I started [at Gainsborough Town in 1980] I just wanted to survive a season. Let alone 45 years as a manager. Fucking hell. Frightening, isn’t it?”Warnock’s managerial career ended in March last year.He resigned after Aberdeen beat Kilmarnock 3-1to reach the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup and, while he won’t discuss the reasons for his abrupt departure from Pittodrie after eight games, Warnock didn’t like off-field interference in his work. He is now apart-time consultant at Torquay Unitedand hopes to help the club return to the Football League. But, in a sign of his diluted focus, the 76-year-old’s attention is also on his upcoming tour, when he willappear at the London Palladium.Warnock sounds suitably gobsmacked in his unvarnished Sheffield accent. “When I was a kid, my mum had multiple sclerosis and my dad worked in the steelworks. But on a Sunday night I used to sit in front of my mum in her wheelchair and she played with my hair while as a family we watched Sunday Night at the London Palladium. So when these shows were being discussed I just said: ‘I’d love to do the Palladium.’ I didn’t suppose we could, but I’ll be thinking so much of my mum and dad.“In those days your dad never told you he loved you. It was macho. But he was a crane driver in the steelworks and after his 16-hour shifts he would come home to a wife with multiple sclerosis and three kids in a two-bedroom semi. You don’t appreciate what he must have gone through until years later.”Warnock’s distinctly human stories prompted Pep Guardiola to invite him into the Manchester City dressing room. Towards the end of last season Warnock spoke to a group of multimillionaire footballers, including Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland, and he grins now.“The first thing I said is: ‘I bet you lot think yourselves lucky you’ve not got me as your manager, because you’d be kicking the ball from there to there and it wouldn’t be on the ground.’ They all creased up. I said a few other things that made them laugh. Afterwards Pep said he’d enjoyed it so much and that you don’t get that now in football – the humour. He said: ‘Everything’s so methodical, so data-driven, blah-blah-blah.’ He said we miss that human element.”View image in fullscreenA young Sheffield United supporter makes his feelings clear before Christmas in 2023.Photograph: PA Wire/PAWarnockinterviewed Guardiola for Sky Sportsand, despite their mutual affection, there is an amusing clash of philosophies. Guardiola cackled through much of the interview but he looked almost bewildered when Warnock said: “We love man-marking.” After Guardiola said “You love, huh? Why?” Warnock explained that, as his teams were technically inferior, they had to try and nullify the opposition. “And the players,” Guardiola asked, “they support it? They like it?” Warnock’s immediate reaction – “well, they had to” – makes Guardiola smile again. As Warnock tells me now, “I never had a good team but I always had a good dressing room.”Warnock was old school. “When I were manager at Palace,” he says, “Man City brought down two buses full of staff. I thought: ‘Bloody hell, I’ve never seen ’owt like it.’ I got our kit man to chuck a bucket of cold water on the floor in their dressing room to make it scruffy as possible.”But there were occasions when Warnock was helpless. “At Cardiff we played City [in 2018] and had a couple of shots. It was 0-0 after 30 minutes and I’m thinking: ‘we’re doing well here’. Then we went in at half-time 2-0 down and after Bernardo Silva scored the second I’m saying out loud on the bench: ‘What a goal. That’s unbelievable.’ And I’m the opposition manager!”Cardiff lost 5-0and were relegated that season when acontroversial 2-1 defeat by Chelseahastened their demise in May 2019.“It’s a lonely job, being a manager,” Warnock says. “I felt very lonely at times and probably the loneliest was at Cardiff when Chelsea got a goal that should have been disallowed for three yards offside. I knew that would relegate us. The dressing room was desolate because the lads had given me absolutely everything. I can tell you now the linesman was Ed Smart and Craig Pawson refereeing. I can see it as if it were yesterday. I’ll be looking at that on my grave.“I told the referee and linesman: ‘I wish you could come in my dressing room and see the desolation because you didn’t do your jobs right.’ We didn’t deserve to go down that year.”Warnock was fined £20,000 for complaining about the officiating but now his attention reverts to Guardiola. “I noticed how much he was having to bite his tongue when you looked at the goals City conceded towards the end of last season. It wasn’t anything tactical. They were just bad mistakes. I knew it hurt him but he’s got the bit between his teeth again now. I’m going to be interested in seeing how they go this season because they’ll be a threat. Liverpool have spent all that money and Arsenal are spending as well, but Pep’s signed two or three good players. He’s the best manager since I’ve been around and I think he’ll prove it again.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Oh my God, his intelligence.” Warnock and Wenger also had an unlikely bromance. “He liked me and he respected me. It was said that Wenger never had any managers in his office after a game but he always invited me. On one occasion I even took my kids in and we had a picture in his office.” He frowns when I suggest it’s strange Ferguson has not been added to his top three. “I’d have to put Fergie in,” he says grudgingly. “But I’d have Pep and Arsène before him.”View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola and then Cardiff manager Neil Warnock at their 2018 FA Cup meeting.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAWarnock once spoke warmly of Ferguson and how the Scot would write to him encouragingly after every promotion and relegation. But his attitude has hardened now. “I don’t really want to talk about him because I’ve not got anything good to say.” Is that because Ferguson played a weakened Manchester United side against West Ham in the final game of the season in 2007? “Absolutely. Unforgivable, in my eyes. Same with [Liverpool’s] Rafa Benítez. He played the kids at Fulham that same year.”The pain for Warnock was intensified because Sheffield United, his boyhood team,were relegatedafter they lost at home to Wigan and West Ham stayed up after beating United by a solitary goal scored by Carlos Tevez, whose registration was thought to be ineligible by Warnock and many others. Has he spoken to Ferguson since that disastrous day? “No,” Warnock says with icy finality.He is happier discussing another managerial icon in Clough. “I was at Notts County [between 1989 and 1993] and Cloughie used to walk past our little training ground to get to their 10 acres where they had a fantastic training facility. He would be with [Clough’s assistant at Nottingham Forest] Alan Hill and a black labrador. Cloughie would walk across my pitch. He never walked around it and nobody said ’owt. He looked round at what we were doing, shook his head and walked on. Brilliant!”Warnock laughs before becoming more serious again. “We drew 1-1 at their place and at one of our lunches, he said: ‘You don’t realise, son, but it’s a remarkable job for a club like Notts County to be competing with us in the top division. It’ll never happen again, what you’ve done.’ And of course Notts County went from the old First Division to non-league football.View image in fullscreen‘When I was at Notts County, Cloughie would walk across my pitch.

Look where they are now. To get Notts County in the top flight? If I had a fashionable name or I were a fashionable manager, I think I’d have got more acknowledgment. But they gave me an award this year at the Football League, for my contribution to the EFL.”Warnock sinks back in his chair and smiles: “I thought: ‘Bloody hell. It’s about time!’”Neil Warnock: Are You With Me? is at Opera House, Manchester on 29 August, London Palladium on 18 September and Ashton Gate Stadium, Bristol on 28 September.

He plays Frank Drebin Jr, the police-detective son of Leslie Nielsen’s Frank Drebin in the original. Created by the celebrated comedy team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, The Naked Gun was released in 1988, with Nielsen featuring in two sequels, The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear from 1991 and Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult in 1994, as well as the preceding TV series Police Squad!, which aired in 1982. Neeson’s intense, unflappable acting style has been acclaimed by critics as a perfect match for Nielsen’s celebrated stone-face delivery;the Guardian’s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw said thatNeeson “deadpans it impeccably”, whilethe Telegraph’s Robbie Collin writesthat Neeson “delivers his dialogue with a gravelly matter-of-factness that only compounds its lunacy”.View image in fullscreenNeeson in the ‘dad action’ film Taken, 2008, which revived his career.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/AllstarAt the age of 73, Neeson’s current status as the star of a hit mainstream comedy – augmented byrumours of a romancewith his co-star Pamela Anderson – is a world away from his emergence as a bona fide leading man in the early 1990s, when he put his teenage proficiency in boxing to good use in the Scotland-set drama The Big Man, bagged an Oscar nomination for playing Oskar Schindler in Schindler’s List, and nobly donned plaid, kilt and sporran as 18th century highlander Rob Roy.Neeson’s ability to project a weighty sense of gravitas in these wildly differing roles was compounded by his casting as Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins, in Neil Jordan’s 1996 biopic, the most politically sensitive – and closest to home – of his early leading roles. Born in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, Neeson was raised Catholic but later said he was, ironically, inspired to become an actor after watching the firebrand Protestant leader Rev Ian Paisley preach, saying: “It was incredible to watch this 6ft-plus man just bible-thumping away.”View image in fullscreenNeeson, right, with Ewan McGregor in 1999’s Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.Photograph: Lucasfilm/AllstarNeeson’s career took its first unexpected deviation in the late 1990s when he was cast as Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, George Lucas’s return to the Star Wars universe in 1999, with Lucas describing Neeson as “a master actor, who the other actors will look up to”. This excursion into fantasy-blockbuster moviemaking was cemented with a role as principal antagonist Ra’s al Ghul in Christopher Nolan’sBatman Beginsin 2005, and lending his voice to Aslan the lion in the three Narnia films from the same period: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Neeson’s standing in the industry also allowed him to take smaller roles in landmark films in the same period, including Gangs of New York and Love Actually.He had, however, lost his leading-man status in Hollywood, and it was the success ofTaken– a French production, written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel – that returned him to the spotlight. Neeson later said he was “stunned” by its impact, adding: “I really thought it would be kind of a little side road from my so-called career. Really thought it would go straight to video.” Taken’s box office receipts amounted to nine times its $25m (£19m) budget and virtually inaugurated the “dad action” movie, thrillers featuring leads in late middle age; it is also the film with which Neeson is arguably now most identified with. Neeson went on to make a string of dad action films, including Unknown, Non-Stop, The Ice Road and Retribution.Neeson’s reinvention as an action star coincided with a period of personal tragedy, after thedeath of his wife, Natasha Richardson, in a skiing accidentin 2009. The pair had met in 1993 while co-starring in a Broadway production of Eugene O’Neill’s play Anna Christie, and married a year later. Neeson later said that grief over her death was partly responsible for his withdrawing from the lead role in Steven Spielberg’s biopic of Abraham Lincoln, released in 2012, in which he was replaced by Daniel Day-Lewis.View image in fullscreenHis role in the Steven Spielberg-directed Schindler’s List was Oscar nominated.Photograph: Atlas Photography/JB EntMore recently Neesonwas heavily criticised, and subsequently apologised, for saying that, in his youth, he had gone out looking to “kill” a random black man in revenge for a sexual assault on a friend. Neeson had mentioned the incident in 2019 during the press tour for another action film, Cold Pursuit, later saying: “The horror of what happened to my friend ignited irrational thoughts that do not represent the person I am. In trying to explain those feelings today, I missed the point and hurt many people.”Neeson’s career, however, appears to have been relatively unaffected by the controversy,as well as his commentin 2018 that the recent wave of sexual misconduct allegations in the entertainment industry was “bit of a witch-hunt”. With The Naked Gun commanding significant media attention – as much for speculation on Neeson’s personal life as for the film itself – the actor’s stock is as high as it has ever been.Explore more on these topicsLiam NeesonLeslie NielsenTakenSchindler's ListBatman BeginsChronicles of NarniaprofilesShareReuse this content"

Bond is perhaps best known for the Pet Shop Boys movie It Couldn’t Happen Here, released in 1988; but that was just one pitstop in an unusually shaped career that took the form of, if not two halves, two distinct sections that in retrospect appear subtly intertwined.Bond’s commission from thePet Shop Boysstemmed from earlier work on The South Bank Show, particularly an episode about Roald Dahl in which the author encounters characters from his books – and in fact much of Bond’s career was occupied by what are essentially arts documentaries, albeit highly unconventional ones. He started off at the BBC in the early 1960s, with programmes about the first world war poets and George Orwell, culminating in a still-impressive film in 1965 about Salvador Dalí, called Dalí in New York, which investigated the constructed nature of Dalí’s artist personality by using, among others, “meta” shots of Bond himself discussing the filming process.View image in fullscreenJane Arden on the set of Separation in London’s Portobello Road in 1966.Photograph: Kaye/Getty ImagesDalí in New York was also significant because it was the first time Bond directed a well-known writer, actor and media intellectual named Jane Arden. It wasn’t the first time they had met, or worked together, but no doubt it cemented their creative relationship. Shortly afterwards, the pair would work together on what would become Bond’s feature directing debut in 1967. Separation, written by and starring Arden, is a cut-up, fractured account of a woman unhappily caught between a failing marriage and a younger lover she is uncertain about, all against the backdrop of mid-60s swinging London. The fact that Arden was herself in a failing marriage (to TV director Philip Saville) and in a relationship with a younger lover (Bond himself) is no doubt relevant.Arden isa fascinating figure in her own right; apart from anything else, she appears to be the only woman in the whole of the 1970s to have a solo directing credit on a British feature film. That would be the next film she and Bond made together, The Other Side of the Underneath, based on Arden’s happening called A New Communion for Freaks, Prophets and Witches, which she developed with her all-female theatre company Holocaust. Having been a successful playwright and TV writer, it is clear that in the period since Separation, Arden had absorbed the most radical ideas of the time, from anti-psychiatry to encounter-group therapy. The Other Side of the Underneath, which Bond produced and appeared in, is one of the most extraordinary, if deeply unsettling, films to have been made in the UK.Perhaps the stress of making it suggested to Arden she should share the directing of their third film, Anti-Clock, with Bond It is a bizarre, hermetic, and often baffling fable featuring one of Arden’s sons, Sebastian Saville, who plays both a therapy subject and the professor attempting to treat him. Arden’s motives, though, remain obscure; she killed herself in 1982 and Bond subsequently withdrew from circulation the films they made together. Twenty-five years later, however, they were rediscovered and reissued by the British Film Institute, an amazingly valuable act of cultural archaeology.View image in fullscreenJack Bond.Photograph: noneArden’s death closed a chapter. In retrospect, Bond’s part in it looks like an extension of the improvisatory, boundary-breaking style he brought to his documentaries – which, if you squint a bit, could also include It Couldn’t Happen Here. Bond continued to make films focusing on creative personalities – notablyThe Blue Black Hussarin 2013 which allowed Adam Ant to ruminate onthe mental health crises that derailed himsome years earlier. Perhaps if Bond had made a successful awards-bait feature, or if Arden had been more inclined to create a conventional narrative, either or both of them might be more widely known, or sustain a more significant place in British film culture. Be that as it may, their films, along with Bond’s solo work, are fascinating in their own right, and unquestionably worth seeking out.Separation and It Couldn’t Happen Here are screening at the Ultimate Picture Palace, Oxford,on 2 August, and It Couldn’t Happen Here is screening in a double bill with Battleship Potemkin scored by Pet Shop Boys at BFI Southbank, London on 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDocumentary filmsSalvador DalíPet Shop BoysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I just hope what he said was within the line. I hope it didn’t cross the line, and was good old honest sledging. It definitely got Joe out of his bubble.”Root, who across the first four matches of the series had scored two centuries and averaged 67.16, was duly dismissed for 29. “That was the plan,” Krishna said. “But I didn’t really expect the couple of words that I said to get such a big reaction from him. It was a very small thing. We’re good mates off the field – it was just a little bit of banter and both of us enjoyed it, I think.”On another occasion Akash Deep put an arm around Ben Duckett’s shoulder to usher him off the field after the England opener was dismissed for a quickfire 43, something England’s assistant coach Marcus Trescothick thought might have provoked a more violent response.View image in fullscreenIndia celebrate after Mohammed Siraj traps Joe Root lbw for 29.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“A lot of players would have just dropped the elbow on him,” he said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a bowler do that after getting someone out.

There’s no need to walk him off in that fashion, but the game has been fought in good spirits – although there’s been many words and arguments along the way, the two teams are still getting on well enough and will continue to do so once the game is done.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A highly respected English lock forward leading out a history-chasing team in the same stadium which staged the 2003 Rugby World Cup final? It is not the worst of precedents for Maro Itoje as he and his modern-day Lions await their third and final date with destiny.Itoje and his squad would also dearly love to rekindle memories of another significant contest in this city. The decisive concluding Test of the 2013 Lions series was a classic example of a touring side saving its best until last, with a tiring Wallaby sideeventually losing 41-16after a certain assistant coach called Andy Farrell had urged the players to take their hosts to “the hurt arena”.This time around, among other things, Farrell has been invoking the never-say-die ethos of the Irish boxer Katie Taylor, who was asked to record a few motivational words for the Lions. “Prepare to win by skill but be ready to win by will,” was Taylor’s pithy message and, despite the likelihood of wet conditions, Farrell is keen for his team to tick both boxes en route to a 3-0 series whitewash.Tommy Freeman hands Lions major injury scare on eve of third Australia TestRead moreAustralia will have other ideas, of course, but even their head coach, Joe Schmidt, has acknowledged theiragonising near missin Melbourne last Saturday has been tough for his squad to absorb. The series is already gone, the influential Rob Valetini is sidelined again and they are up against opponents who still have a collective glint in their eyes.To make matters worse, the Wallabies have also been enduring further disruption on the eve of the game with Brandon Paenga-Amosa called up as emergency cover at hooker following injuries to Dave Porecki and Matt Faessler. When it rains as pours, as has very much been the case in a soaking Sydney over recent days.Whichever combinations are wearing gold, though, it will not affect the visitors’ stated objectives. They want to fly home as the first Lions squad since 1927 to win every game of a multi-Test series, although the legendary 1974 team did famously claim three wins and a draw against the Springboks. There is clearly a debate to be had about whether beating a moderate Wallaby team compares, say, with outclassing South Africa at altitude but, either way, a 3-0 winning margin would stand the test of time.Emotionally, certainly, there remains much to play for. On the eve of the game, Itoje had his match jersey presented to him by Kate Hardman, who has been diagnosed with incurable breast cancer but is travelling around Australia in a camper van with her husband and three children, seeking to make family memories that will never fade.View image in fullscreenThe British & Irish Lions’ collective spirit has never wavered throughout the series.Photograph: Billy Stickland/INPHO/ShutterstockIf that story doesn’t heighten the Lions’ desire to create a few last golden moments of their own, nothing will. And the more you think about it, the more a clean sweep would also mean to several squad members who have also had to overcome assorted challenges to reach this point.Andrew Porter, for example, was 12 when he lost his mother to cancer and subsequently had to battle mental health issues including an eating disorder. Four years ago, having achieved his lifelong dream of being picked for the Lions, he was injured before departure and was unable to tour South Africa. Among the things that have kept him going is a quote written down by his mum before her death. “Do work you believe in, believe in what you do. Everything else is a waste of time.” For him and his family this tour has been the most heartwarming of postscripts.Everything is clearly relative but a place in the record books would also be something special for Tadhg Furlong, Dan Sheehan, Tom Curry, Huw Jones and Blair Kinghorn, all of whom have spent periods of the last year battling injuries which tested their resolve. Ditto Hugo Keenan and Tommy Freeman, who wasstruggling with a back injuryon Friday, both late developers not obviously heading for Lions greatness in their teens. And not forgetting Bundee Aki and Jamison Gibson-Park, for whom the notion of wearing a red Lions jersey was never even on their radar.Sprinkle all these individual plotlines into the same crusading narrative and their shared power has been significant. The Lions could have folded at 23-5 down in Melbourne but, even in their darkest moments, the squad’s competitive spirit has never wavered. This is also not a squad who are mentally already on the beach; the hosts may be in for another tough day regardless of the weather.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

White’s box kicking, though, may prove useful in the conditions while the Exeter-bound Tom Hooper will want to make an impact in Valetini’s absence. Hooper hails from Australia’s self-proclaimed toughest town (Bathurst, in case you’re ever passing) and, along with the colossal Will Skelton, offers a steely physical edge that Australia will definitely require.Even that, however, may not be sufficient if the Lions still have some collective gas left in the tank. Sheehan, Furlong, Itoje, Curry, Gibson-Park, Tadhg Beirne and Finn Russell would all be candidates for inclusion in a composite matchday 23 drawn from the last three Lions tours and one more command performance could yet elevate a couple more into that category.View image in fullscreenIt is hard to dispute Andy Farrell’s credentials as an all-time Lion king after his success in Australia.Photograph: David Davies/PAIt is also increasingly hard to dispute Farrell’s credentials as an all-time Lion king, capable of pressing performance buttons that other coaches struggle to reach. Even his captain, who used to attend the same Hertfordshire school as Owen Farrell, has been increasingly fascinated by Farrell Sr’s instinct for what makes a rugby player tick. “I don’t know if it is a surprise but it has reaffirmed that he’s just an impressive character,” stressed Itoje.“He’s a brilliant orator, he holds the room and is a great motivator of men. He’s also quite thoughtful. Probably what has surprised me is how hot on detail he is. He is very particular on detail and how the week flows, which is very good from a players’ point of view. I’ve enjoyed the experience.”All that remains now is to drag the Wallabies back into the hurt arena one last time.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsLions tour 2025Rugby unionAustralia rugby union teamAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having set himself the task of returning a title for Ferrari, anticipation for his first season with the team was off the scale but success has been far from forthcoming. As the Scuderia have struggled the seven-time champion has been drawing on every bit of experience in what may be the defining challenge of his storied career.At the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend Ferrari announced they wereextending their contractwith team principal, Fred Vasseur, backing the Frenchman who was instrumental in bringing Hamilton on board to complete his mission of reforging Ferrari into a championship-winning outfit after underachieving for so long. However as the season approaches its summer break, with 10 races to come after Budapest and Ferrari winless, Vasseur still has much to achieve.Vasseur signs new long-term Ferrari contract to end Horner speculationRead moreHamilton has been outspoken in his support for Vasseur since he made the switch after 12 years with Mercedes but, during a season of acclimatisation and adaptation to a new team, the British driver has appreciated that he must do more than drive. Rather it seems, as Michael Schumacher managed to such great success withFerrari, to take a leadership role.It is believed Hamilton was somewhat taken aback at the team’s organisation and methodologies when he began working with them and that he felt the decision making process was ungainly. He has repeatedly stressed he is convinced they have the talent in personnel to succeed but it has become clear he thinks they must be utilised better.At Belgium last week he was unusually candid in revealing he had held a series of meetings with the key players at Ferrari: Vasseur, the chair John Elkann and the chief executive, Benedetto Vigna. Moreover he had gone as far as compiling two documents detailing suggestions for the progress he believes is needed to turn around Ferrari’s fortunes, an admission that caused no little stir.One of said submissions was about the car, where he thought it could be improved and more crucially where they might take it under the new regulations next year. This might be considered the due diligence of any committed, ambitious and thoughtful driver. However of more significance was the second aimed at the operational approach at Ferrari, the “structural adjustments” he believed were required.“It is a huge organisation and there’s a lot of moving parts, and not all of them are firing on all the cylinders that [they] need to be,” he said. “That’s ultimately why the team’s not had the success that I think it deserves. So I feel that it’s my job to challenge absolutely every area, to challenge everybody in the team, particularly the guys that are at the top who are making the decisions.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton walks in the paddock before the practice session at the Hungaroring.Photograph: Anna Szilágyi/EPAFor the 40-year-old Hamilton there is urgency to this task. Ferrari is surely his last shot at claiming a record-breaking eighth title that would end the team’s drought stretching back to 2007 for a drivers’ championship and 2008 for a constructors’. He is more than aware that since then the Scuderia has come close but still failed to deliver even with former world champions Fernando Alonso and then Sebastian Vettel at the wheel.Over 11 seasons between 2010 and 2020, there were many wins for Alonso and Vettel but still ultimately the team could not seal a championship. Hamilton’s actions and attitude reveal a determination that if he too is to fall short it will not be through a lack of effort on his behalf.“I refuse for that to be the case with me, so I’m going the extra mile,” he said. “I’ve obviously been very fortunate to have had experiences in two other great teams. And while things for sure are going to be different, because there’s a different culture and everything, I think sometimes if you take the same path all the time, you get the same results. So I’m just challenging certain things.”That the best use of the human resource in F1 can be gamechanging could not be better illustrated than with the extraordinary resurgence Andrea Stella has wrought at McLaren in just over two years. Moreover there are also indications that internally Hamilton is already making a difference. “The response has been amazing to the steps that we’ve taken in all areas,” he said in Hungary. “The passion and the desire to continue to do better is what’s the most amazing thing.”On track there is a sense that for all that Hamilton has struggled with the car this year, without a podium for 13 races, the longest period of his career, he remains as sharp as ever. Hisrecent drivesat Silverstone and Spa were proof enough of that and his call to switch to slick tyres in Belgium evidence that his instincts remain finely honed.Hamilton is then putting the building blocks in place, confident that if the team can deliver he will too, having already done the hard yards behind the scenes this season.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton is confident of a change of fortunes for Ferrari that could lead to a record eighth drivers’ title.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAIn first practice at the Hungaroring Hamilton and his teammate Charles Leclerc continued to work with the new rear suspension Ferrari brought to Spa and which they hope will develop into a serious improvement for the car. They finished fifth and third respectively in a session which was once more dominated by the McLarens of championship contenders Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. In the second session McLaren were once more on top, with Norris again leading Piastri by two-tenths. Leclerc was third and Hamilton sixth, with Max Verstappen in 14th, very much struggling with the balance of his ride. The Dutchman’s difficult afternoon was further compounded as he was investigated for throwing a towel, left in error in his car, from the cockpit while on track and issued with a warning for an unsafe release.Norris on Friday looked to ease the pressure on the title race, saying that it does not matter if he fails to beat Piastri to the world championship because “in 200 years we will all be dead”.Asked if he needs to get under the Australian’s skin to land his maiden F1 title, Norris replied: “I don’t enjoy that. In 200 years no one is going to care. We’ll all be dead. I am trying to have a good time. I still care about it, and that’s why I get upset sometimes and I get disappointed and angry at myself. And I think that shows just how much I care about winning and losing.“But that doesn’t mean I need to take it out on Oscar. I just don’t get into those kind of things.”Explore more on these topicsLewis HamiltonFerrariFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We believe we deserve that, after the way the boys have gone about their business.But yes, it was fortuitous, we know that. I am relieved and pleased to get a win.“We are an evolving group. Adding lots of bodies, we are on the journey to the final product. We are not there yet, I think that’s obvious. But 100% we will get there. We still want to be better at the top part of the pitch. We got there a lot and weren’t clinical enough. There’s lots in my mind right now, but we have to be pleased to get off to a winning start.”After Luton struggled to break down their resilient first visitors of the season, Nahki Wells’ hopeful ball forward to Cauley Woodrow was met instead by the head of Johnson and looped agonisingly over goalkeeper Nathan Bishop, off the underside of the crossbar and over the line.On paper this should have been a mismatch – a team with recent Premier League pedigree and the promotion favourites entertaining the surprise outfit who came up from League Two last season with one of the lowest budgets in the division. Even on the day of the game, Luton had been waving the company credit card about, completing the signing of Portsmouth’s Cohen Bramall in the morning before snapping up Swansea’s Jerry Yates in the afternoon.View image in fullscreenNahki Wells (centre) celebrates with Shandon Baptiste (right) and Cauley Woodrow afer his hopeful long ball was headed home by Wimbledon’s Ryan Johnson.Photograph: Adam Davy/PABut not even Luton can rely on plastic to give them an advantage these days. No amount of spending power was ever going to negate Wimbledon’s aerial power but at least Luton seemed up for the battle.Bloomfield may be scratching his head about how to get his new signings to integrate better, but credit still has to be given to manager Johnnie Jackson for getting the most out of Wimbledon’s Crazy Gang spirit.“I’m gutted for my players and supporters. To lose the game in that manner was cruel,” Jackson said. “It’s a hard one to take, a horrible way to lose.But I was really pleased with the structure of the team. We didn’t do enough to go and win it, but I thought we deserved a draw.”What little goalmouth action this scrap produced occurred in the final minutes. Reuell Walters’ low 30-yard drive would have given the game the stunning winner it ill deserved but instead produced the only real save of the match from Bishop, on his Wimbledon debut.Nathan Asiimwe’s desperate block from Lamine Fanne 11 minutes from time was a sure sign Wimbledon were not going to just roll over. If only they had not scored Luton’s goal for them instead. It was desperately unlucky for Johnson, but Wimbledon will bounce back, and this was an occasion when misfortune very much had to be kept in perspective.Sky pundit and former Luton captain Tom Lockyer revealed he is less than a month away from being given the all-clear by doctors to resume his career. The skipper who led the club to the Premier League has not played since suffering a cardiac arrest during Luton’s game against Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium in December 2023, having snapped an ankle ligament during his long rehabilitation.“I’ve had a really good few weeks,” Lockyer said. “Hopefully now I’m four weeks away from getting signed off and told I’m allowed to play football again.”Explore more on these topicsLeague OneLuton TownAFC Wimbledonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Newcastle value their prized asset at £150m, a British transfer-record sum, but are reluctant to sell the 25-year-old, who was the second highest goalscorer in the Premier League last season behind Mohamed Salah.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreGiven how swiftly Newcastle rejected their offer, Liverpool consider it futile to return with a second bid before the transfer window closes on 1 September. Their offer of £110m for the want-away player remains on the table.Liverpool were encouraged to step up their pursuit by Isak’s stance following Hughes’ enquiry and the player’s representatives. The club have spent almost £300m so far this summer, including a£79m deal to sign Newcastle target Hugo Ekitiké. But with £190m recouped in sales since Hughes arrived in June 2024, plus healthy revenues from their title triumph and return to the Champions League, Liverpool are in a position to test Newcastle’s resolve to keep Isak. Their current transfer record isthe £100m paid to Bayer Leverkusen for Florian Wirtz in June. That could rise to a British transfer record of £116m with add-ons.Isak did not travel on Newcastle’s pre-season tour of Asia. The club attributed his absence to a minor thigh injury but the player informed them that he wishes to explore his options this summer, with Liverpool his preferred destination, and has been training at former club Real Sociedad this week. It is unclear whether Isak had Newcastle’s permission to do so. There has also been no progress on a new and improved contract.Quick GuideMilner to wear Brighton's No 20 shirt in Jota tributeShowJames Milner will wear the number 20 shirt at Brighton this season in memory of the late Diogo Jota, describing his former Liverpool teammate as a 'great friend'.The Portuguese forward died aged 28 last month in a car accident, alongside his brother André Silva. Liverpool have retired the number 20 jersey worn by Jota at Anfield in tribute, and Milner has opted to switch from No 6 after Brighton teammate Carlos Baleba changed his squad number from No 20 to No 17.'Once I heard Carlos was looking to change his number and 20 was available, I wanted to do it as a mark of respect and pay tribute to Diogo Jota,\" Milner said. 'He was an amazing player who I was fortunate to play with and a great friend as well. It will be a great honour to wear his number in the Premier League this year.'Photograph: Bradley Ormesher/Times Newspapers LtdWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Isak, signed from Sociedad for around £60m in 2022, has three years remaining on his contract at St James’ Park. Newcastle have maintained that the forward is not for sale but have been attempting to sign other top-level strikers this summer, so far without success. Whether a breakthrough in Newcastle’s striker search softens their stance on Isak remains to be seen.Eddie Howe and his nephew, Andy Howe, have been overseeing the club’s recruitment this summer after Paul Mitchell stepped down as sporting director and with chief executive Darren Eales due to leave on health grounds. As well as Ekitiké, Newcastle have missed out on strikers Liam Delap, João Pedro and Bryan Mbeumo, along with goalkeeper James Trafford,who rejoined Manchester City.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brian Clough pounced to sign the red-haired midfielder after he failed to agree a contract with Hibernian in the summer of 1985. “Eff me, it’s Steve Davis,” roared Clough as Rice entered the manager’s office for the first time.It took until September ‘85 for a tribunal to determine Nottingham Forest would have to pay Hibs close to £200,000 for Rice. He had been unable to play until that dispute was resolved. Clough bawled at Rice again as he walked on to the training pitch the following day. “‘You’ll need to go back to Scotland. I’d need to sell the stand to sign you son,’” Rice recalls.“You should have seen the look on my face. Then he just started laughing. The following week I made my debut at Anfield. Every day was different. You didn’t know if you were training, going to play cricket or for an ice cream.”Scottish football clubs owe more than £22m to government in Covid loansRead moreRice is still very welcome at Forest, where he is most fondly remembered for an audacious finish against Arsenal in a 1988 FA Cup quarter-final. He cites Johnny Metgod as the best player he lined up alongside. Rice also remembers how during a Clough rant at Metgod, the Dutch centre-back snapped back that Forest’s manager had signed him. “And I’ll sell you,” Clough retorted. A fortnight later, Metgod was a Tottenham player.The trouble is, this endearing trip down memory lane is a precursor to Rice’s broader tale. He will begin the new Scottish season back in the top flight as Livingston’s head of football operations, a switch upstairs after time spent on the coaching staff. Rice will be a loss on the training pitch – he is widely regarded as a superb coach – and an inevitable success in his new post. The 61-year-old’s knowledge of football in Scotland is encyclopedic.Rice did not begin gambling in the midst of Forest’s laddish culture. “Mine started when I was at school,” he says. “Throwing pennies against a wall, playing cards. I barely had a drink before I went to Nottingham because I wanted to be a football player and the training was intense. Drink really didn’t interest me, but I always gambled.View image in fullscreenBrian Rice (back row, far right) with his Nottingham Forest teammates after their Littlewoods Cup win in 1989.Photograph: PA Photos/PA“My dad gambled every day but that was 5p or 10p and it was fun to him. It was fun to me to start with, then it escalated. It takes a grip of you. I knew I had a problem, a massive problem. But in those days, to ask for help was a sign of weakness. Now I know it is a massive sign of strength.”Fast forward to January 2020 and the Scottish Football Association announce Rice, then the manager of Hamilton, has been given a 10-game ban for betting on matches. “October 15th,” he says. “I was going to watch Scotland Under-21s against Germany at Firhill. The phone went at half past four in the afternoon. It was the club secretary saying: ‘Brian, we have had the SFA on and they are going to investigate you regarding gambling in football.’ I said: ‘Thank God it is over.’“I was so relieved it was finished. The next day I went in to see the club owner, told him everything and made sure we went to the SFA and did the same. I gave them everything.” A whispering campaign ensued, including one that suggested Rice bet on games involving his own clubs. That proved to never be the case throughout a decade’s worth of wagers the SFA examined.Alongside the suspension, I had to go to meetings for a year. But it was the best punishment they could ever have given me.Scottish football’s relationship with gambling is complex. Betting firms as sponsors are everywhere. Any harm attached to Rice’s episode was primarily to himself. “It was self-inflicted,” he says. “I knew I was doing wrong. I don’t make excuses about it.“I don’t think in any other line of work you would be punished for having an addiction. You get help. But they did help me. Alongside the suspension, I had to go to meetings for a year. It was the best punishment they could ever have given me. I was going to three or four meetings a week and I still do that to this day. Those meetings have changed my life, educated me and let me know why I gambled. It has given me the foundations to have a better life. If I stop going there, my mindset could change again. I’m not ashamed, I am doing something about my problem.”View image in fullscreenBrian Rice on the touchline at the Tony Macaroni Arena in Livingston during his time as Hamilton manager in 2020.Photograph: SPP Sport Press Photo./Alamy“I know of cases that have been swept under the carpet, that nobody knows about,” Rice adds. “Players reported to be injured at their club and they aren’t. I know that for a fact because I have spoken to the players. But I think it is better that way, better than the way it came out with me. People have families as well.”Rice has had low points. Plenty of them. “I was on the top of the 32-storey building in Qatar and ready to step off it,” he says. “That’s where it took me.” His successful relationship with Falkirk counted for nothing when a fan used gambling as a means to abuse the then-manager at Alloa Athletic. “‘I hope it never happens to your family,’ I replied. It was horrible. They see it as banter and I have to take it. I didn’t that day because it was Falkirk and, to be fair to the club, they were fantastic. The guy didn’t have the guts to come forward.”The 24-hour, 365-days availability of betting is unlike when Rice played on either side of the border and he believes he sold himself short with trips to the horse racing, casino or bookie when he could have been training. He also urges young footballers to get in touch if they fear gambling issues are spiralling out of control.“I know the signs to look for,” Rice says. “In six years, I have helped more than a dozen players and am still doing so now. Players think it is a quick fix; stop gambling for a month and I’ll be cured. It’s not stopping gambling, which can be quite easy; it’s changing your habits. I had to completely change the way I lived, even the way I drove home so I wasn’t passing five betting shops. Fill your day better.”The day after our chat, I message Rice to express gratitude for his candour. “It’s my story and I’ve nothing left to hide from nowadays,” he replies. “Thanks again.” Judgment should include the fact he is one of the game’s good guys.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.org.

Lottie Woad had played herself firmly into the second-round mix at this Women’s Open at five under par, but the 16th at Royal Porthcawl was to bite back atEnglish golf’s golden girl.Woad’s second shot found trouble – it took Lydia Ko, one of Woad’s playing partners, to find the ball – and her third swing barely caused any movement whatsoever. Woad called for a referee, plus a second opinion, in her belief that her ball was now embedded and worthy of free relief. With the claims refused, she had to declare the ball unplayable. This grisly affair eventually culminated in a triple-bogey seven and a round of 70 which for so long had looked like further demonstrating Woad’s rapid ascent to the summit of her sport.“There was a lot more good in it than bad,” said Woad. “I played really well for 17 holes, just that one hole cost me a bit.“I think it’s probably the toughest hole on the course. The tee shot is hard to hit the fairway and then you’ve got three wood into a very strong wind. Anything that’s missing the target is going to be exaggerated. So I pushed it and got a pretty unlucky lie. It wasn’t too thick around there apart from where I was. So I couldn’t really do much with that.”Woad admitted she was disappointed that officialdom had declared that her ball was not embedded. “I just had to forget about it as quickly as possible,” she added. Woad missed from four feet for a birdie at the last, meaning she remains nine adrift of the lead. By her own admission, and even owing for the vagaries of links, that may already be too far.The broader problem for Woad and all others is that Miyu Yamashita has taken quite a grip on this tournament. The Japanese player’s 65 launched her to 11 under, meaning a three-shot lead over her compatriot Rio Takeda. Yamashita’s bogey-free round included a stunning back nine of 32.View image in fullscreenMiyu Yamashita signs autographs following her second round of 65.Photograph: Oisin Keniry/R&A/Getty ImagesClose inspection of Yamashita’s form indicates her prominence in Wales should be no real surprise. While the terrain might be somewhat different from what the 23-year-old is used to, jousting at the summit of leaderboards appears second nature. She has won 13 times on the Japan Tour and had 43 top-three finishes since April 2021. In this, her rookie year on the LPGA Tour, she has recorded 10 top-20 finishes from 16 starts. Yamashita shares her name with a Japanese wrestler, which must lead to some interesting moments when observers are punching letters into Google. The golfing Yamashita missed the cut in the Women’s Open last year. She appears on a mission to make up for that.Lindy Duncan’s 70 moved her to four under, where she has Pajaree Anannarukarn and Chiara Tamburlini for company. Madelene Sagström moved into touching distance of the group behind Yamashita, the Swede’s 69 meaning a three-under total at the 36-hole point.At two under, Porthcawl member Darcey Harry comfortably survived for the weekend. “I keep forgetting that this is actually my home course and I’ve played it before,” she said. “I have to keep reminding myself I know the course, so I don’t know why I’m stressing. I just have to try to enjoy the atmosphere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anything can happen on this course. You can get in trouble, big trouble any time. I definitely think today was quite a stressful day for everyone because the cut’s on the line. I can reset for tomorrow.” The world No 1, Nelly Korda, like Woad and Harry, is at minus two.There was a golden moment for Steph Kyriacou, who made a hole in one with her gap wedge at the 8th. “I didn’t see it go in, which sucked, but the crowd went nuts,” said the Australian. “It didn’t damage the hole, which was surprising, so it was quite clean. My first official hole in one with no asterisk. Pretty excited. I had a hole in one in a practice round before. There were witnesses, first ball, but it’s not really the real deal, is it?

The Mauritian did not panic and her dogged pursuit of the group containing Niewiadoma, Vollering and Ferrand-Prévot paid off when she rejoined them close to the finish.“I think I almost died a few times on the descent,” Le Court said. “The last 4km of the uphill were difficult. My body just completely shut off.View image in fullscreenKim Le Court breathes a sigh of relief after recovering to retain the yellow jersey.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesOnce I got to the top, I knew I had to do the best downhill of my life to try and come back. I did a recon of the descent a few weeks ago so I knew what was coming, and I just had to go full gas. I think I went 10 times faster than the recon.”Meanwhile, on the eve of the toughest mountain stage in the race, Ferrand-Prévot’s drastic weight loss was the subject of some scrutiny after images of her racing jersey, pinned at the sleeve so it didn’t hang loosely, emerged in the Dutch media.The debate has been fuelled by comments made by French rider Cédrine Kerbaol who, alarmed by the weight loss among her peers, told French media: “We’re in a dangerous moment. There are a lot of people that have won big races with very low weight, and young girls, who are trying to perform, will take them as an example. What’s happening is not great.”“Top-level sport is extreme in every way,” Rutger Tijssen, sport technical manager at Ferrand-Prévot’s Visma-Lease a Bike team, told Sporza.On SaturdayToday, when the women’s peloton will tackle both the 13km-long Col de Plainpalais and, later, a summit finish on the “beyond category” Col de la Madeleine – an 18.6km climb to 2,000m – power-to-weight ratios will be pivotal.“Pauline’s leaner than in the spring,” Tijssen said, “but this also requires different things when you have to climb the Col de la Madeleine. Then it’s logical that you adapt.”Ferrand-Prévot won the Olympic mountain bike title at Paris 2024 but has since devoted herself to road racing with the goal of winning theTour de France Femmes.“She’s not much leaner than she was a year ago,” Tijssen said. “Of course, she stays healthy. You know what’s happening and you make choices, which we monitor.”The next 48 hours will decide the outcome of the race, which includes summit finishes on the Madeleine and at Châtel, as well as the daunting climb of the Col de Joux Plane on Sunday. Only 35 seconds currently separate the top five in the overall standings, but with more than 6,000 metres of climbing still to come, those gaps are certain to widen.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesCyclingTour de FrancenewsShareReuse this content"

The Australian-trained mare, Asfoora, a Group One winner at Royal Ascot last summer, made a brief attempt to challenge against the far rail while She’s Quality finished fast down the middle, but Jm Jungle and Jason Hart had just enough left to hold on for a neck success.Glorious Goodwood: Whirl dances through storm after messy flag startRead moreIt was a second win in the race in the space of three years for the John and Sean Quinn stable,successful in 2023with the hugely popular Highfield Princess.“It was easier watching Highfield Princess because she never looked like getting beat,” Sean Quinn said. “I was hoping, willing for the line to come in the last furlong today, but it did and he toughed it out. The second [She’s Quality] came to him and I think he went again.“He is so good on these downhill tracks, but then he’s good at York, he is just a good horse. Jason said after York [in May] that he would love to ride him in the [Group One] Nunthorpe [at the same track] because they will go lickety-split and that will suit him really well. He is a Group Two winner now and we don’t have far to go, 20-odd miles [to York], so that is something to look forward to.”Jm Jungle is top-priced at 16-1 for the Nunthorpe on the third day of York’s Ebor meeting later this month.In Ireland, meanwhile, the news on Friday morning that Thurles racecourse will close with immediate effect was met with sadness and surprise by fans and professionals alike.Tony McCoy, the 20-times British champion over jumps, and Rachael Blackmore, the first female rider to win the Grand National, both rode their first winners at the County Tipperary track, while leading steeplechasers including Allaho, Sizing John and Amberleigh House landed the track’s Grade Two Kinloch Brae Chase.“It was a major shock this morning to hear the news,” Willie Mullins, the reigning champion trainer over jumps in both Britain and Ireland, said on Friday. “It will be a huge blow for Irish racing, more specifically Irish jump racing and winter jump racing.“Thurles is a track that always had beautiful ground in the winter when other tracks couldn’t.”Thurles had been scheduled to stage 11 fixtures during the 2024/25 season.“I think we’ll be doing our best to see if there’s any way we can save the track for racing in Ireland,” Mullins said. “It will need a lot of local support. However, on the bigger scale, Irish winter jump racing needs it too, I think.”Get It can sprint home in Stewards’ CupA remarkable 37mm of rain arrived at Goodwood on Thursday and the going was officially heavy by mid-afternoon, but the clerk of the course has since suggested that it was probably no worse than soft and breezy weather ahead of Saturday’s Stewards’ Cup should accelerate the drying-out process. If so, it can only be good news for George Baker’sGet It (3.05)in his attempt to repeat last year’s front-running success in Glorious Goodwood’s historic sprint handicap.There was a sense that Get It had a fair slice of luck on his side after last year’s victory, not least as he had a perfect draw against the stands’ rail, but there was no fluke about his similar all-the-way success in the Wokingham Handicap at Royal Ascot at June, at a track that does not favour front-running tactics to anything like the same extent.That was a new career-best for George Baker’s seven-year-old and he has ended up just one stall further away from the rail this time around, while a drop in Get It’s rating during lacklustre spell in Bahrain earlier this year means that he is just 6lb higher in the weights despite two wins already this season.Pat Cosgrave’s rivals will be forewarned of his plan this year but that does not necessarily mean that it will be any easier to counter, and Get It is a tempting 10-1 chance to become the second dual winner of the Stewards’ Cup in the space of three years.Goodwood 1.20Al Aasyappeared to back out of a struggle more than once in the early years of his career but an overall strike-rate of 40% – 10 wins from 25 starts – is hard to knock and he was a cosy winner of this contest 12 months ago.Goodwood 1.55The stoutly-bredFrench Dukewas never a factor after a slow start in the Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes at Royal Ascot last time, Roger Varian’s gelding had progressed by the race to that point and could well improve further for this step up in trip.Newmarket 2.10An opening mark of 77 looks more than fair forAwaafi,who lost little in defeat under a penalty at Haydock last time and should appreciate the stiffer finish here.Goodwood 2.30The lightly racedWaardahimproved significantly for the step up from a mile to 10 furlongs at this track last time out and she is bred to progress further for an additional half-mile as she tackles Group company for the first time.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowGoodwood1.20 Al Aasy 1.55 French Duke (nb) 2.30 Waardah 3.05 Get It (nap) 3.45 Mudbir 4.20 Isaac Newton 4.55 LonglaiThirsk1.38 Rikki Tiki Tavi 2.15 Nepal 2.50 Bondi 3.25 Blind Beggar 4.05 It Just Takes Time 4.40 Big Leader 5.15 Stormy Pearl 5.50 Captain ValloDoncaster1.45 New Vega 2.20 Dublin Bay 2.55 Valley Ofthe Kings 3.30 Rock Diva 4.10 Anthropologist 4.45 Meet Me In Meraki 5.20 Roundhay ParkNewmarket2.10 Awaafi 2.45 Kaori 3.20 Sioux Life 4.00 Best Rate 4.35 Moon Angel 5.05 Night On EarthLingfield Park5.10 Crystal Mariner 5.40 Fascinating Lips 6.15 A Mere Bagatelle 6.45 Slipper Time 7.15 Rajeteriat 7.45 Mashaan 8.15 Flicka’s GirlHamilton Park5.55 Victor Cee 6.30 Chico Magnifica 7.00 Junkyard Dog 7.30 Classy Al 8.00 Good Point 8.30 Inanna 9.00 WeegeebearWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Newmarket 3.20This drop in grade could see a return to winning form forSioux Life,a Group Two winner in Italy last year, after coming up short in Group company on her first two starts for Marco Botti.Goodwood 3.45Mudbirhas an ideal draw against the rail and had no issues with the drop from a mile to seven furlongs when successful on his handicap debut at Sandown in July.

Its leadership, its launch schedule and even its name: all havecaused inconclusive, semi-public rows. The opportunity provided by political novelty appears to be being wasted.For the many journalists and politicians who always see the left as incompetent and naive, the stop-start, seemingly uncoordinated first weeks ofYour Party, as it may or may not eventually be named, have felt like a gift – a summer silly season story after months of grim political acrimony. “Thank Christ Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana are here to give us a laugh,” wrote Sebastian Murphy in the Daily Express. “Labour’s loopy Left have bravely broken free of Starmer’s stultification to bring us a political party that is easily the funniest thing since the anti-Brexit centrists Change UK.” Now largely forgotten, Change UK lasted 10 months after splitting from Labour in 2019.For left-leaning Britons who’ve had enough of Labour’s rightward shifts and intolerance of dissent, and have been hoping for a viable alternative, the new party’s launch has been depressing. Why, in times which so obviously require a radical fightback, can’t the left agree a clear way forward? Why is it still so dependent on Corbyn, who after 42 years in parliament can hardly be presented as a fresh figure? And where are the nimble strategists that the immensely difficult task of establishing a successful leftwing party is going to need?Some of the answers to these questions, which British leftists often ask each other with despairing shrugs and eye-rolls, lie in socialism’s struggles in this country since the 1980s. These have left the movement with gaps and imbalances, which are exposed whenever it tries to take the initiative.Yet as well as considering these weaknesses, it’s also important to acknowledge that, despite all the confusion and ridicule, Corbyn and Sultana’s new party has struck a nerve. It says that more than 600,000 people have signed up on its rudimentary website for updates and information about how to get involved – almost as many people as the memberships of Labour, the Tories and Reform UK combined. In some of the most hostile coverage of the new party, there is a revealing note of alarm. “Something has actually gone seriously wrong with British society,” wrote Camilla Tominey in the Telegraph, “if a party such as this could poll at 18 per cent” – theproportion who told YouGovthey would “consider” voting for a new Corbyn-led party. “It’s a rebellion against the broken status quo.”Superficially, this rebellion seems little different from the half dozen that have tried and failed to break Labour’s left-of-centre monopoly over the past 30 years: Respect, Left Unity, the Workers party of Britain, the Socialist party, the Socialist Labour party, the London Socialist Alliance. Well-known leftists such as Arthur Scargill and George Galloway attempted to turn strong local power bases, personal charisma and leftwing credibility into something bigger, at times when Labour was alienating its more radical supporters. A few parliamentary and council seats were won, but rarely for long. The new parties were both too narrow – dominated by one person – and too broad – prone to ideological differences – to sustain their initial momentum. With their ageing figureheads and traditional leftwing sectarianism, the new parties did not seem new enough.This time, the involvement of Sultana, one of the most digitally fluent young MPs, sends a different signal. So does the involvement of innovative and ambitious political operators, such as Momentum co-founder James Schneider, who helped make Corbyn’s Labour leadership, at times, surprisingly dynamic and popular– despite it being widely written off, as the new party is now. Six years on from Corbynism’s defeat, there is finally a movement, largely undetected by the mainstream media, of bright, youngish leftwing activists back into the political game.And yet, as the frictions between Corbyn and Sultana have shown, it remains tricky to unite two leftwing generations, very different in age and levels of political patience – while also appealing more effectively to middle-aged Britons, who grew up under New Labour and often absorbed its centrist assumptions. These difficulties afflicted Corbyn’s Labour leadership, and ultimately helped destroy it.The British left has so often been excluded from power over the past 40 years that it frequently lacks the skills that experience of power can bring: building and sustaining coalitions, maintaining message discipline, creating political organisations that are representative without being too fractious. Truly leftwing British parties, in short, tend to be a bit rickety, yet they must stand up against our conservative political culture’s strongest winds.Then again, such deficiencies may matter less nowadays. The deep discontent and many crises left by 14 years of rightwing rule, impatience with Starmer’s methodical but patchy reforms, and outrage at his government’s Gaza evasions, mean that many voters are in an adventurous – or reckless – mood. A radical party with a highly divisive leader, thrown-together structure and frequent internal rows already exists, and it’s called Reform. Its poll lead suggests that voters are less interested than journalists in party processes, and more interested in stories about what’s wrong with Britain, compellingly told. Whether at rallies or on social media, Sultana and Corbyn are just as capable of this as Nigel Farage. A new poll shows that Reform voters stronglyprefer Corbyn to Starmer, which suggests that the new party could take Reform votes.Labour focused on appeasing Reform, not beating them, says Jeremy CorbynRead moreReform has more media backing than the new party ever will. Yet it’s likely that rightwing journalists will keep giving the leftwing party publicity, and even some favourable coverage, in order to hurt Labour. So the new party will need to pull off a balancing act: keeping its personalities and factions happy, developing populist but not fantastical policies, and wounding the government without helping Farage into Downing Street.Labour loyalists will say that a left divided is a left defeated. But if they truly believed that, Starmer’s party and government would be much more pluralist. What these loyalists really think is that the left should only ever be divided on their terms. That entitled and coercive logic has now had consequences. A new leftwing party, risky and imperfect, could be here to stay. This time, it’s possible that our politics will never be quite the same again.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsJeremy CorbynOpinionZarah SultanaLabourSocialismcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s how it felt watching England’s Lionesses romping gleefully across the pitch after their victory in Basel – not just because they won but because of the way they did it, with an exuberance and a resilience and an obvious love of playing together that makes them irresistible to watch. That 65,000 people came out in the drizzle for theirhomecoming paradedown the Mall was testament not just to the deserved new popularity of women’s football but also to the longing for a national event that, even if only briefly, made us feel cheerful, expansive, as if all things were possible.So it’s interesting that for hersummer beach readingRachel Reeves pickedAbundance, the American journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s blueprint for the more permanent rebuilding of hope and joy. It’s a pro-growth,techno-optimist rallying cryfor progressives to reinvent themselves as purveyors of plenty and good times in contrast to the right’s crabby, mean-spirited “scarcity mindset” – which revolves around the belief that there isn’t enough good stuff to go round and therefore the priority is snatching it back off immigrants or the poor or whatever bewildered former ally Donald Trump accuses ofripping America off.Klein and Thompson argue convincingly that for decades western consumers have been fobbed off with an abundance of stuff we fleetingly want – fast fashion, cheap flights, more streamed content than anyone has time to watch – but a paucity of stuff we actually need, such as affordable homes near where the good jobs are, or cheap green energy. Where the authors will divide the room, however, is by claiming that’s partly down to years of liberal politicians attaching well-meaning strings to public building projects, from environmental protections to procurement rules to US zoning laws for housing, which although noble in intent collectively make it impossible to build. It was Reeves’s jolting recent description of red tape as a “boot on the neck” of business that first made me wonder if she’d read the fervently deregulatory Abundance. Though it focuses on the California housing crisis, there are enough relatable stories – the nimby neighbours fighting affordable homes because they’d prefer more car parking, or the decades wasted failing to build a high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and San Francisco – for it to have done the rounds at Westminster andamong Australian progressivestoo.Like all snappy bestsellers, it’s sometimes glib. Klein and Thompson talk a great game about facing up to reality – if you can’t have speedy housebuildingandgenerous protection for bat andnewt habitats, say, which do you want most? – yet place enormous faith in the magical ability of still-unproven technologies to solve problems without creating new ones. Their vision of a utopia involving driverless cars, lab-grown meat and bounteous vegetable crops from so-called vertical farms (essentially giant greenhouses powered by renewable energy) would sound more convincing if it weren’t forhorror stories about autonomous drivingor the struggle to makevertical farmingremotely viable in Britain. But there’s something undeniably appealing at its heart.Plenty is an innately American idea, at home in the land of bottomless refills and vast open skies and permanently reaching after more, bigger, better. But from a British left perspective, what’s interesting is its relationship with altruism. Scarcity makes people selfish, anxious, distrusting of others and prone to hoarding whatever they’ve got: think of shoppers fighting over loo rolls in lockdown. But in times of abundance, we relax, becoming more generous.Klein and Thompson’s proposals for a 21st-century era of plenty – build lots of affordable housing and prioritise super-cheap clean energy to lower household bills and unleash industrial innovation – aren’t exactly revelatory to a Labour government already committed to most of this (though in Britain some might add the need toreform an electricity marketwhere prices are still artificially pegged to gas). What Labour hasn’t yet nailed, however, is the emotional framing that turns rather worthy but dull-sounding infrastructure projects into the genuinely exciting makings of a better life.Abundance by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson review – make America build againRead moreSomewhere in abundance theory are the glimmerings of a story that brings together otherwise disparate policies and people. What Ed Miliband and Angela Rayner, the two natural abundance politicians on the cabinet’s soft left, share with those on the technocratic right like chief AI cheerleader Peter Kyle, is mostly a mindset: an ebullience, an enthusiasm, and a refusal to see everything as hopeless that matters to progressive parties, because they’re in the business of hope. Never more so, arguably, than when the right is deep in the business of doom.Nigel Farage’s great appeal to his followers used to be the fact that he liked a drink and a laugh; that he was so obviously enjoying himself. But lately his party has begun to sound bitter, nihilistic, oddly hysterical. Claiming that Britain is on the verge ofsocietal collapseplays well on X, already awash with nonsense aboutno-go zonesin Birmingham and civil war in Europe, but perhaps less well in daylight. Britain has big problems, many of them deep seated. But it’s still a country where people wash their cars in suburban driveways on a Sunday afternoon, not apost-apocalyptic wastelandwhere we’re all one step away from barbecuing rats for supper. There’s undeniably a market for politicians wallowing angrily in dreams of a better yesterday. But I suspect there’s still a bigger one, out there in the rain, waiting to catch sight of a better tomorrow.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionHousingEnergy efficiencyRachel ReevesNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Yet much of it is based on misinformationGeorge Billinge is a former Ofcom policy managerFri 1 Aug 2025 11.22 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 12.28 EDTShareLast week, the UK’s Online Safety Act came into force. It’s fair to say it hasn’t been smooth sailing. Donald Trump’s allies have dubbed it the “UK’s online censorship law”, and the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, added fuel to the fire by claiming that Nigel Farage’s opposition to the act put him “on the side” of Jimmy Savile.Disdain from the right isn’t surprising. After all, tech companies will now have to assess the risk their platforms pose of disseminating the kind of racistmisinformation that fuelledlast year’s summer riots.What has particularly struck me, though, is the backlash from progressive quarters. Online outlet Novara Media published an interview claiming the Online Safety Actcompromises children’s safety. Politics Joe joked that the act involves “banning Pornhub”. New YouGov polling shows that Labour voters areeven less likelyto support age verification on porn websites than Conservative or Liberal Democrat voters.I helped draft Ofcom’s regulatory guidance setting out how platforms should comply with the act’s requirements on age verification. Because of the scope of the act and theabsenceof a desire to force tech platforms to adopt specific technologies, this guidance was broad and principles-based – if the regulator prescribed specific measures, it would be accused of authoritarianism. Taking a principles-based approach is more sensible and future proof, but does allow tech companies to interpret the regulation poorly.Despite these challenges, I am supportive of the principles of the act.As someone with progressive politics, I have always been deeply concerned about the impact of an unregulated online world. Bad news abounds: X allowing racist misinformation to spread in the name of “free speech”; and children being radicalised or being targeted byonline sexual extortion. It was clear to me that these regulations would start to move us away from a world in which tech billionaires could dress up self-serving libertarianism as lofty ideals.Instead, a culture war has erupted that is laden with misunderstanding, with every poor decision made by tech platforms being blamed on regulation. This strikes me as incredibly convenient for tech companies seeking to avoid accountability.So what does theact actually do? In short, it requires online services to assess the risk of harm – whether illegal content such as child sexual abuse material, or, in the case of services accessed by children, content such as porn or suicide promotion – and implement proportionate systems to reduce those risks.It’s also worth being clear about what isn’tnew. Tech companies have been moderating speech and taking down content they don’t want on their platforms for years. However, they have done so based on opaque internal business priorities, rather than in response to proactive risk assessments.Let’s look at some examples. After the Christchurch terror attack in New Zealand, which was broadcast in a 17-minute Facebook Live post and shared widely by white supremacists, Facebook trained its AI toblock violent live streams. More recently, after Trump’s election, Meta overhauled itsapproach to content moderationand removed factchecking in the US, a move which its own oversight board has criticised as being too hasty.Rather than making decisions to remove content reactively, or in order to appease politicians, tech companies will now need to demonstrate they have taken reasonable steps to prevent this content from appearing in the first place. The act isn’t about “catching baddies”, or taking down specific pieces of content. Where censorship has happened, such as the suppression of pro-Palestine speech, this has been taking placelong before the implementationof the Online Safety Act.Where public interest content is being blocked as a result of the act, we should be interrogating platforms’ risk assessments and decision-making processes, rather than repealing the legislation. Ofcom’s new transparency powers make this achievable in a way that wasn’t possible before.Yes, there are some flaws with the act, and teething issues will persist. As someone who worked on Ofcom’s guidance on age verification, even I am slightly confused by the waySpotify is checkingusers’ ages. The widespread adoption of VPNs to circumvent age checks on porn sites is clearly something to think about carefully. Where should age assurance be implemented in a user journey? And who should be responsible for informing the public that many age assurance technologies delete all of their personal data after their age is confirmed, while some VPN providers sell their information to data brokers? But the response to these issues shouldn’t be to repeal the Online Safety Act: it should be for platforms to hone their approach.Worried about your child’s screentime? Get a landline | Emma BrockesRead moreThere is an argument that the problem ultimately lies with the business models of the tech industry, and that this kind of legislation will never be able to truly tackle that. The academic Shoshana Zuboff calls this “surveillance capitalism”: tech companies get us hooked through addictive design and extract huge amounts of our personal data in order to sell us hyper-targeted ads. The result is a society characterised by atomisation, alienation and the erosion of our attention spans. Because the easiest way to get us hooked is to show us extreme content, children are directed from fitness influencers to content promoting disordered eating. Add to this the fact that platforms are designed to make people expand their networks and spend as much time on them as possible, and you have a recipe for disaster.Again, it’s a worthy critique. But we live in a world where American tech companies hold more power than many nation states – and they have a president in the White House willing tostart trade warsto defend their interests.So yes, let’s look at drafting regulation that addresses addictive algorithms and support alternative business models for tech platforms, such as data cooperatives. Let’s continue to explore how best to provide children with age-appropriate experiences online, and think about how to get age verification right.But while we’re working on that, really serious harms are taking place online. We now have a sophisticated regulatory framework in the UK that forces tech platforms to assess risk and allows the public to have far greater transparency over their decision-making processes. We need critical engagement with the regulation, not cynicism. Let’s not throw out the best tools we have.George Billinge is a former Ofcom policy manager and is CEO of tech consultancy Illuminate TechDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This week, crisis PR-style, shelent her world-class expertiseto Astronomer, the company that dragged everyone’s eyes up to the jumbotron at a Coldplay concert two weeks ago when two of its married executives wereentwined where they shouldn’t have been.In the immediate aftermath of the scandal, during which themale half of the pair resigned, a widely asked question was: could the mass public shaming of two executives from a company no one had heard of – “a niche tech startup with roughly 300 employees”,as the New York Times put it– be considered a net win or a loss for Astronomer? It was a tough one to judge. On the one hand, all publicity is good publicity. On the other, is being known as the company that brought us two pilloried presumed adulterers necessarily a recommendation for its data and AI services?Enter Paltrow, with her instinctive ability to ride waves of popular sentiment – and former marriage to the lead singer of Coldplay – appearing in a video released by Astronomer’s social media team. “Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days and they wanted me to answer the most common ones,” said Paltrow, looking straight to camera with that slight smirk she always wears that seems to say “members of my family happen to find me very amusing”. A series of questions then appears on screen, including “OMG! What the actual f-.” To which Paltrow replies: “Yes! “Astronomer is the best place to run Apache Airflow.” And so on.It works because it’s a knowing, clever spin that owns the outrage – and it’s a big win for Astronomer, whose average of 150 likes on its social media posts jumped to 64,000 with Paltrow’s video. It may even help rehabilitate the pair involved. Of course, the biggest win was for Paltrow and the impression she gave, brilliantly managed, of being a thoroughly and relatably good egg.TuesdayInto the same midsummer vacuum where news might otherwise appear, bursts this: Sydney Sweeney discourse! Quick recap: Sweeney, star ofWhite Lotusand the romcomAnyone But You, has appeared in an advert for American Eagle, a slightly creaky US leisurewear brand that like so many mid-range brands from the 90s – Urban Outfitters, Eddie Bauer, even good old Banana Republic – has been suffering from a lack of relevance. The campaign, in which Sweeney lounges in double denim, would seem to be doing what advertising should, which is to get people talking about it, although possibly not inthe same sentence as “eugenics”.It seems like a stretch but the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” – a lame pun on “genes” suggestive of the possibility that AI is already operating in the advertising space – has been taken up by loud voices on social media as anunsubtle endorsement of “Nazi” values, in which blond hair, blue eyes and being thin constitute apex hotness.“Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality and even eye colour,” intones Sweeney in the ad, leaving off the list resting sulking face, vocal fry and indistinguishability from 90% of other women in Hollywood. All of which probably rules out Paltrow for the follow-up crisis-management video.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump in Scotland on Tuesday: “They follow me around everywhere, and what people don’t know is that those skirts they’re wearing and the tubes they’re blowing into? All invented for me.”Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/APWednesdayLet’s progress to even shallower water, and words that roll off the tongue like a meditation phrase promising to unlock the meaning of everything: the “seamless,sculpt face wrap from Skims”. It’s an iambic tetrameter and also a new product line from Kim Kardashian, whose amazingly successful shapewear, Skims, advances in a natural progression from body to face sculpting with a new kind of face sling.The sculpt face wrap might look, at a glance, like something you would be given by an A&E doctor after standing too close to the chip pan, but it’s actually “jaw support” that you wear, like a retainer, overnight to hold back the terrible, glacial progression of jowls. According to the company, this item is not merely a piece of stretchy material you might have fashioned yourself out of an old pair of tights, but rather a “signature sculpting fabric” made of “collagen yarn”, which for £52 a pop and already selling like hotcakes is definitely a real thing that exists.ThursdayWaking to an experience that used to beintegral to British summerbut feels increasingly rare: rain on the window and a cold tentacle of air seeping in through the crack. It’s a strange relief, and also a teachable moment to my kids enjoying their first summer in this country and who have entirely the wrong idea about the place. It’s August tomorrow, and for the past six weeks they haven’t bounced once from shorts into sweatpants and jumpers and back again, as the rain boots gather dust and my love of waterproof outwear goes unfulfilled.And while they look out at the rain, grumbling at what it does to the day’s plans, I have a first thought out the gate that confirms my final, and total, transformation into my own mother: “Hmm, good for my plants.”FridayIn my house I’m banned from saying “skibidi”, “gyatt”, “hyperpigmentation” and “Ohio sigma” – and this week, a new addition has been made to the list. Grandma-like, I’ve cottoned on toKPop Demon Hunters– a film in which a K-pop group hunts demons disguised as a boyband, which is breaking records on Netflix as the most-streamed original animated film of all time – and am now forbidden by my children from singingSoda Pop, the tween summer anthemfrom the movie. “You’re my soda pop, my little soda pop/ Cool me down, you’re so hot / Pour me up, I won’t stop (oh, oh) / You’re my soda pop.”Happy summer!View image in fullscreenDutch woman wins European Mum Dancing championship in tight finish against younger contestants.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekGwyneth WilliamsAdvertisingKim KardashiancommentShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer would dismiss him as a nimby, but on this Trump has a pointFri 1 Aug 2025 05.32 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 05.54 EDTShareTrigger warning. Some readers may find this disturbing. Not everything Donald Trump says is mad and a lie. Not all of itis about money. Some of it iseven worth saying. When he came to office, one of Trump’s first actions was extraordinary. He directed his fire at what he saw as the ugliness of American architecture.He demandedthat at least federal buildings should be “visually identifiable as civic buildings, and respect regional, traditional, and classical architectural heritage in order to uplift and beautify public spaces and ennoble the United States”. All plans had to be submitted to Washington for his approval.There was more than an element of psychological obsession in such bureaucracy. American classicism – born of an admiration for France’s republicans – was a cult throughout the 19th century. The White House was based on a Dublin mansion. This weekit was announcedthat it is to get what it has always lacked, a sumptuous new ballroom in which to receive and entertain foreign dignitaries. It is to be classical, with no nonsense about trying to make it look modern. That a president should seek to revive both regional and European style in the face of America’s relentless modernism is a breath of fresh air.That aesthetic interest extends to landscape. Trump left Scotland this week clearly still seething over the wind turbines waving over his coastal Turnberry and Aberdeen golf courses. At Turnberry eight tower over a hill inland. The president cannot avoid the sight of wind turbines. “Ugly as hell”, “monstrosities”, “so noisy and so dangerous”, and a threat to “Scotland’s tourism industry”,he has described them.Turnberry has lost Trumptens of millions of poundsover the decade since he bought it, but he loves golf and his mother’s home country of Scotland. The course also has the most exquisite view over an old lighthouse to the prominent island of Ailsa Craig across the water. There is no question: the turbines spoil the setting.Whatever Trump says about wind power killing birds and driving whales mad – most of it rubbish – there is no denying that about 4,000 giant turbines are now desecrating Scotland’s in-shore waters.There is no signof any Scottish politician showing the slightest concern for their visual impact. The chief consideration is a turbine’sproximity to the grid, in other words profit. The price has been a real loss of wildness in Scotland’s once-glorious islands.Trump may be wrong to deride the value of renewable energy, and he may talk nonsense about other evils of turbines. But he is not wrong to demand that we should consider how and where to locate them.He pleads thatin the US they are “killing the beauty of our scenery, our valleys, our beautiful plains”, and he is right. From what I have seen in California, turbines are located without a thought for their scenic impact.The reality is that I cannot recall a single British minister who would these days mention scenic beauty as a consideration in any area of policy, be it energy or planning or transportation. A generation ago, few in Britain would likewise have dared to complain about the building of ugly petrol stations in open country, where most now lie empty and derelict. So now no one – other than Trump – dares complain about turbines. Generally sent well offshore by the Cameron government in the 2010s, they are now to return onshore,enticed by the energy secretaryEd Miliband’s crazy subsidies.Ed Miliband would let a turbine farm destroy Brontë country. We need net zero, but at what cost? | Simon JenkinsRead moreIn spring came Trump’s most remarkable initiative. He announcedhe would take overfrom New York’s transport authority the future of its notoriously grim Penn Station, the original having been demolished in 1963. An adventurous plan had been hatched during his first term by his president of the Commission of Fine Arts, Justin Shubow. It was for a return to the station’s neoclassical forerunner, widely regarded as the US’s finest terminus and partner to the majestic Grand Central up the road.In April Trump duly appointed the federal rail operator Amtrakto revive Shubow’s projectwith a price tag of $7.5bn. Its majesty is to rise again on the initiative of a president eager to demonstrate stylistic taste in the American public sector. Eat your heart out Liverpool Street; get lost Euston.Clearly there is a limit to what Trump can change in just four years in office. Much of what he does is psychodrama and playacting. The president with whom he is becoming comparable is Teddy Roosevelt after 1900. He too tested the limits of presidential power. He too was frantic to lead the daily news agenda. But he too seemed to care about America’s natural environment, its forests and deserts, and a role for Washington in their custodianship.To show aesthetic sensitivity is today regarded as a weakness in a politician. Breathe the words art, conservation or natural beauty in the presence of Keir Starmer and you are dismissed as a nimby.Where Trump ends up leading his country and the western world may well prove alarming. It is certainly impossible to predict. But I find it refreshing to have a leader unashamed to talk of beauty and ugliness. I like him being ready to debate style. Above all, I welcome him calling out a scenic abomination when he sees one.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This one is for American Eagle and the campaign line idea is that Sweeney, clad in denim, has great jeans. Get it?An apparel company employing a zeitgeisty actor and exploiting an obvious genes/jeans pun to flog denim would not normally be noteworthy. But the ad has sparkedan intense online discussion, one which has now bubbled up to the White House, about whether having a blond-haired, blue-eyed actor – who happens to keep pretty quiet about politics – talking about her great genes is a racist dog-whistle and nod to eugenics.The supporting evidence for this is a campaign video (which appears to have been removed after backlash)in which Sweeney, looking at the camera suggestively, says: “My body’s composition is determined by my genes.” There’s then a little joke about the cameraperson looking at her breasts before she continues: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color … My jeans are blue.”In a TikTok reaction videowith almost 300,000 likes, one influencer accuses the Euphoria actor of ignoring the current political climate. “It’s literally giving, I don’t know if I should say this, Nazi propaganda,” the TikToker proclaimed. (Probably shouldn’t have said that, to be honest.) She also asked, exasperated: “Why do you need to sexualize jeans so much?” Oh, my sweet summer child, have you never seen an advert before? Sex supposedly sells (although studiesrefutethis piece of advertising wisdom) and eventoothpastewill get sexualized.The pockets of liberal outrage over the Sweeney ad have been a godsend to Fox News, which has covered the backlash to the ad campaign 28 times more than it coveredthe Epstein controversy this week. Even White House staffers have spoken out about this extremely important issue. “Cancel culture run amok,” the White House communications manager, Steven Cheung,wrote of the ad on X. “This warped, moronic and dense liberal thinking is a big reason why Americans voted the way they did in 2024 ...” The conservative TV personality Megyn Kellyalso decriedthe “lunatic left” getting upset about nothing.You wait your whole life for an advert with a weird fixation on genetics to come out and then, what do you know, two come along at once. Instead of the American Eagle controversy fizzling out after a couple of days of online outrage, thestory tookon new dimensions this week after people noticed that a new Dunkin’ ad for its Golden Hour refresher (some kind of alarmingly yellow beverage) also mentions genetics.“This tan? Genetics,” actor Gavin Casalegno, says in the ad. “I just got my color analysis back. Guess what? Golden summer, literally!”More like Angry Influencer summer, literally! “Why are ads so obsessed with genetics all of a sudden?” one TikTok user commented on Dunkin’s post. Another asked: “Genuinely, what does a drink have to do with genetics?” (Again, have none of these people ever seen an advert before? Chocolate has nothing to do with gorillas, and the Cadbury’s “drumming gorilla” ad is one of the greatest pieces of marketing of all time.)It is established wisdom that youneed at least three examplesto call something a “trend”. Unless a toothpaste advert featuring bright white teeth (the result of my superior genetics!) drops while I write this, we’re currently at “weird coincidence” rather than full-blown conspiracy. But this isn’t to say that we should dismiss all the buzz as a load of influencers getting angry about nothing. Adverts hold a mirror up to society and the repeated reference to genetics does say something about the current moment.Perhaps what it screams the loudest is that brands are no longer concerned about trying to look progressive. For just under a decade (ending around 2022) we were very much in the era ofwoke-vertising,where brands were busy trying to co-opt feminism and activist culture.View image in fullscreenKendall Jenner in a Pepsi advert.Photograph: YoutubeThere was, for example, that famousKendall Jenner Pepsi ad in 2017in which Jenner creates world peace by giving a police officer at a protest a Pepsi. In the same year a financial firm installed a “‘Fearless Girl’” statue by the famous Charging Bull in Wall Street, to make a point about how investment banking is empowering, actually. And even Victoria’s Secret got a “feminist” rebrand in 2017. Ad agencies also spent a lot of time pulling together panels about how important diversity is. (I worked in advertising for a long time and was on a lot of those panels.) Now that Trump has declared war on DEI, a lot of companies have gleefully done away with pretending to care about diversity or feminism.While I don’t think the American Eagle and Dunkin’ ads are in any way a nod to eugenics, I’m also not sure that they would have come out in 2020, when the George Floyd protests meant racism was a national conversation. There would probably have been a lot more sensitivity to how references to genetics might get perceived.The repeated reference to genes also reflects the way in which certain eugenicist views have started to move from the racist fringes into mainstream culture.Elon Musk has repeatedly said he wantssmart people to have more kids, for example; a common refrain in pro-natalist circles. MeanwhileSimone and Malcolm Collins, who have been dubbed “hipster eugenicists”, have generated a million headlines for their quest to have an army of genetically optimized children via IVF. Meanwhile more startups are popping up that promise to screen IVF-created embryos for “desirable” traits.One service has suggested that people who use their service might end up with a child who is, on average,six IQ points smarterthan the child they would have had through natural conception. American Eagle may not be selling eugenics to the masses quite yet, but we are certainly entering an era of designer genes.Explore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionRacecommentShareReuse this content"

AlthoughI have retired, I was scheduled to teach a large lecture course on this topic in the fall as a “special lecturer”, but I cannot do so under the conditions Columbia has accepted by capitulating to the Trump administration in June.Prominent historian cancels course at Columbia University over Trump dealRead moreSpecifically, it is impossible to teach this course (and much else) in light of Columbia’s adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness withIsrael, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings.Under this definition of antisemitism, which absurdly conflates criticism of a nation-state, Israel, and a political ideology, Zionism, with the ancient evil of Jew-hatred, it is impossible with any honesty to teach about topics such as the history of the creation of Israel, and the ongoing Palestinian Nakba, culminating in the genocide being perpetrated by Israel inGazawith the connivance and support of the US and much of western Europe.The Armenian genocide, the nature of the absolute monarchies and military dictatorships that blight most of the Arab world, the undemocratic theocracy in Iran, the incipient dictatorial regime in Türkiye, the fanaticism of Wahhabism: all of these are subject to detailed analysis in my course lectures and readings. However, a simple description of the discriminatory nature of Israel’s 2018 Nation State Law – which states that only the Jewish people have the right of self-determination in Israel, half of whose subjects are Palestinian – or of the apartheid nature of its control over millions of Palestinians who have been under military occupation for 58 years would be impossible in a Middle East history course under the IHRA definition of antisemitism.Columbia’s capitulation has turned a university that was once a site of free inquiry and learning into a shadow of its former selfIt is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination – which at this moment in history almost invariably amounts simply to opposition to this genocide. Scores of students and many faculty members have been subjected to these kangaroo courts, students such as Mahmoud Khalil have been snatched from their university housing, and Columbia has now promised to render this repressive system even more draconian and opaque.You have stated that no “red lines” have been crossed by these decisions. However, Columbia has appointed a vice-provost initially tasked with surveilling Middle Eastern studies, and it has ordained that faculty and staff must submit to “trainings” on antisemitism from the likes of the Anti-Defamation League, for whom virtually any critique of Zionism or Israelis antisemitic, and Project Shema, whose trainings link manyanti-Zionist critiques to antisemitism. It has accepted an “independent” monitor of “compliance” of faculty and student behavior from a firm that in June 2025 hosted an event in honor of Israel. According toColumbia’s agreementwith the Trump administration, this “Monitor will have timely access to interview all Agreement-related individuals, and visit all Agreement-related facilities, trainings, transcripts of Agreement-related meetings and disciplinary hearings, and reviews”. Classrooms are pointedly NOT excluded from possible visits from these external non academics.The idea that the teaching, syllabuses and scholarship of some of the most prominent academics in their fields should be vetted by such a vice-provost, such “trainers” or an outside monitor from such a firm is abhorrent. It constitutes the antithesis of the academic freedom that you have disingenuously claimed will not be infringed by this shameful capitulation to the anti-intellectual forces animating theTrump administration.I regret deeply that Columbia’s decisions have obliged me to deprive the nearly 300 students who have registered for this popular course – as many hundreds of others have done for more than two decades – of the chance to learn about the history of the modern Middle East this fall. Although I cannot do anything to compensate them fully for depriving them of the opportunity to take this course, I am planning to offer a public lecture series in New York focused on parts of this course that will be streamed and available for later viewing. Proceeds, if any, will go to Gaza’s universities, every one of which has been destroyed by Israel with US munitions, a war crime about which neither Columbia nor any other US university has seen fit to say a single word.Columbia’s capitulation has turned a university that was once a site of free inquiry and learning into a shadow of its former self, an anti-university, a gated security zone with electronic entry controls, a place of fear and loathing, where faculty and students are told from on high what they can teach and say, under penalty of severe sanctions. Disgracefully, all of this is being done to cover up one of the greatest crimes of this century, the ongoing genocide in Gaza, a crime in which Columbia’s leadership is now fully complicit.– Rashid KhalidiRashid Khalidi is the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies atColumbia Universityand author of The Hundred Years’ War on PalestineExplore more on these topicsColumbia UniversityOpinionGazaIsraelAntisemitismWest BankPalestinian territoriesTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But the UN secretary general,António Guterres, struck an optimistic note in a recent speech in New York. The world, he said, “is on the cusp of a new era … The sun is rising on a clean energy age.” Pointing to falls in the cost of onshore wind and solar, and the risk of further gas-price shocks in future, he called on big technology companies – whose datacentres are one reason for soaring energy use – to adopt a target of 100% low-carbon electricity by 2030.Given US president Donald Trump’s personal hostility to renewable energy, Mr Guterres may be right that it makes more sense to demand action from US businesses at this point. In Scotland earlier this week, Mr Trump launched his latestmisleading tirade, urging European leaders to “stop the windmills”.His repeated attacks on wind power, as well as the recentcancellation of billions of dollars of green energy investment, make Mr Trump a destructive outlier. But populist parties in other countries are also ramping up their opposition to climate goals. In the UK, such positions were once confined to the political fringe. Now, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, is a net zero sceptic who has floated the possibility of a future government quitting the Paris agreement, while her acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie,accused the UN’s most senior climate scientists of bias.This disturbing shift rightly provoked astrong responsefrom the government. In July Ed Miliband called out Ms Badenoch’s party for its irresponsible and anti-science stance. With the UN’s deadline for countries to present their climate plans (known as nationally determined contributions) coming up, Mr Miliband deserves praise for his commitment. Climate diplomacy depends on politicians having the courage to face down opponents – and convince the public that a safe and secure energy future is within reach.This is the prospect held up by Mr Guterres, who hopes it will galvanise much-needed action. The goal, agreed two years ago, of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030, isnowhere near being reached. With the UN climate summit nearing, all eyes are onChina– the key player in the global renewables boom and the fight to stay within  climate limits.Internationally, and domestically, renewables are the right choice. Colonial rule saw Carbon Briefrankthe UK as the world’s fourth-largest historical emitter, behind only the US, China and Russia. To keep UK public support strong forgreen policies, energy ministers – notably Mr Miliband – must ensure awell-planned green transitionto bring down prices. Grids need upgrades to handle wind turbine growth. Supply chain bottlenecks and concerns abouthuman rightsin critical minerals mining must be addressed.In Britain, proposals from Labour MPs to reform energy billing – cutting costs for low-income households that use less power – aren’t just about loweringinflation. They raise a deeper question of fairness, and deserve serious attention as a step toward a more equal energy system, potentially through a social tariff. Ultimately, reforms should cut gas’s sway over electricity prices and couple optimism on renewables with honesty about the challenges.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Those demonstrations saw the statue of the Bristol slave traderEdward Colstondragged from its pedestal and dumped in the harbour, whilemultiple Confederate monumentswere removed from cities in the southern US.Statues in Britain have gradually reflected evolving social values. A statue of the suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst was unveiled in Westminster in 1930, two years after women were finally granted the vote on equal terms to men.Nelson Mandelajoined Winston Churchill in Parliament Square in 2007. The nurse Mary Seacole became the first named black, Caribbean woman to be honoured with a UK statue in 2016. In the same year, the Monumental Welsh Women campaign was established. It set itself atarget of five statues, and has only one to go.But are statues of individuals out of step with democratic sensibilities? Rather than raise subscriptions to cast models of great men and women from the past, contemporary backers of public art often opt for different styles and forms – for example, the giant statue of an anonymous black woman that was recently displayed in New York’s Times Square. CalledGrounded in the Stars, this was the work of a British artist,Thomas J Price.In other cases, enthusiasts continue to fundraise for traditional, lifesize statues of individuals. While the vast majority of such statues in Britain represent men (many of them aristocrats), the highest-profile recent campaigns have been for memorials of women. According to the Public Statues and Sculpture Association, there are currently147 statuesof named, non-royal women. Among them isJane Taylor, who wrote the lullaby Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, and since last year has stood with her sister Ann on the high street in Colchester, Essex. Another isMary Anning, the pioneering fossil hunter, who can be seen striding towards the seafront with her dog in Lyme Regis, Dorset. In Brighton, theMary Clarke statue appealaims to erect a statue of this overlooked women’s suffrage campaigner by the same sculptor, Denise Dutton. Clarke, who was Mrs Pankhurst’s sister, died on Christmas Day 1910 after being force-fed in prison andhas no memorial anywhere.Permanence can beproblematic: statues erected in one era may celebrate traits later condemned. But it is refreshing to see the achievements of women celebrated, and municipal statuary become more representative of a diverse nation – and less dominated by the aristocratic and imperialist values of the past. Campaigns for new outdoor monuments are generally spearheaded by those with a strong commitment to a place as well as a person. When they succeed, these projects can boost confidence in the local public realm. Amid a tortuous debate about the statue of Cecil Rhodes in Oxford – which remains in place in spite of a lengthycampaign to remove it– Bristol’s anti-Colston protesters proved that direct action can decisively alter the built environment. It also sparked an unprecedented public reckoning with the legacies of slavery in Britain in the months after – with the removal or alteration of almost70 tributesto enslavers and colonialists.One that went was a statue of slaveholderRobert Milliganin east London. Next year, its spot will be filled with a sculpture by the artist Khaleb Brooks. Called The Wake, the bronze shell will stand as amemorialto transatlantic slavery’s millions of victims. Symbolic change isn’t a substitute for tackling today’s inequalities. But it’s still meaningful.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

PlusJeanette Hamiltonon the importance of talking to childrenFri 1 Aug 2025 12.58 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareWhy is it that, in all of the recent discussion of oral literacy (Letters, 30 July;Editorial, 27 July;Simon Jenkins, 24 July), there appears to be no mention of the one subject that already exists that has speaking and listening at its very heart: drama? Of course, discussion, debates, rehearsed readings – all of the things that advocates of oral literacy cite – are vital. And all are embedded within the drama curriculum. Debates don’t have to be formal; watch a group of children negotiate how to form and shape a piece of drama, and you see vivid debate in action. Rehearsed readings? Surely rehearsed performance is better. So why this apparent dismissal?Perhaps it is distrust of the creative imagination that drama has as its very basis. Or the focus that the subject also has on movement as another vital tool of communication? Or is it a distaste for the apparent unruliness of the drama studio, where children do not sit in rows (other teachers dread covering for drama, in case they are required to oversee such chaos)? Of course, the debating chamber has its place. But what is for most children their most common oral experience, and frequently their most abiding memory? Performing in the school play, whether that be the infant nativity play or Shakespeare or some other challenging text. By all means, encourage oracy in the classroom. But don’t forget the drama studio or the school stage.Chris WaltersLittle Ickford, BuckinghamshireI would go further back than school to develop oracy in children. How sad to see so many parents pushing their children in buggies, or even carrying them in slings, but glued to their phones instead of engaging with them. Even from birth, it is so important to interact with the young child.Jeanette HamiltonBuxton, DerbyshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Both ended with successful delivery, and I can’t imagine life without my two children. But I wonder whether my daughter will have inherited my predisposition to sickness throughout pregnancy, just as I did from my own mother.It is wonderful news to think there might be some safe medical option for her and many other women. I had many miserable days and nights with sick bowl to hand, eating one Rice Krispie every 30 minutes and always, always, throwing it back up. I theorised that a morsel of sugary goodness would get through, somehow. For my second pregnancy, under pressure to return to work after six weeks’ sick leave, I spent a morning in the staff toilet before being allowed home again for another month.The nausea and vomiting started before a positive pregnancy test and ended within hours of giving birth. It took a lot of persuasion for me to embark on a second pregnancy and I’ve never regretted it, but memories soon fade.Since then I’ve had chemotherapy, which made me so sick that I required all the anti‑nausea drugs on offer. But being pregnant was worse, maybe because I hadn’t anticipated fighting to stay alive as part of the deal. Thanks, Abi, for giving voice to an issue that affects many of us, and causes women to die while pregnant – yet is ignored.Dr Wendy BryantChappel, EssexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Over 6 million people visited a Tate gallery in 2024. Your report (Tate director blames Brexit and Covid for slump in visitors, 29 July) compares our latest attendance figures for Tate Modern and Tate Britain against the most visited year in their history, 2019, when they had 700,000 more visitors than the year before. It would be fairer to compare with an average of annual attendances before Covid.As your article notes, the number of UK visitors to Tate’s galleries has returned to 95% of pre-pandemic levels. Attendances at paid-for exhibitions at both Tate Modern and Tate Britain are also back up to pre-Covid levels. Almost all of the remaining shortfall is in international tourists’ visits to the free collections. However, a further 1 million people engaged with Tate works in exhibitions worldwide. While demographic changes in European visitation have had an impact, our success with local audiences, the achievement that your article notes of 76,000 visitors to Tate Modern’s Birthday Weekend (70% of whom were under 35), and our upcoming programme of Pablo Picasso, JMW Turner,John Constableand Tracey Emin, have given us a stronger platform than ever for future growth.Maria BalshawDirector, TateI would have to agree with those who blame Tate’s woes on things other than Brexit and Covid. Since the heady years of the noughties and teens, it seems that the Tate has failed to really capture the imagination with its exhibitions offer. Where are the shows of the magnitude ofCruel Tenderthat shed new light on what a photograph could be and do? Nor has there been anything to match the gutsiness of the Mona Hatoum retrospective, the delight of Christian Marclay’s The Clock, the immersiveness of Olafur Eliasson’s The Weather Project or the political cogency of Ai Weiwei’s Sunflower Seeds.Apart from theLynette Yiadom-Boakyeportrait show at Tate Britain and the El Anatsui pieces in the Turbine Hall, there has been little, in terms of contemporary art, to set the pulse racing of late. It doesn’t help that the Turner prize – once a focus of national conversation – is now so low-key as to barely warrant a mention in the press. Maybe contemporary art has run out of energy, but surely in the current era we need a vibrant art and public gallery scene to engage us in discussion of pressing issues.Catherine BlissTonbridge, KentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Cases brought by two others – alleging that commissions paid to car dealers were bribes and that dealers owed a duty of loyalty to the customer – were rejected.Johnson told the Guardian: “Even though I won, I just feel like it’s a dark day for the UK consumer … I was just hoping it could have helped others claim back what they should not have been charged, in my opinion.”However, the door is still open to a more limited compensation scheme being considered by the Financial Conduct Authority.The FCA said on Friday that it would confirm whether or not it would press ahead with a compensation scheme before the stock markets opened on Monday morning. It said: “We want to bring greater certainty for consumers, firms and investors as quickly as possible. We will be working through the weekend to analyse the judgment and determine our next steps.“Our aims remain to ensure that consumers are fairly compensated and that the motor finance market works well, given around 2 million people rely on it every year to buy a car.”The MoneySavingExpert.com founder, Martin Lewis, urged consumers to “do nothing” while the FCA determines the scope of a potential compensation scheme. He also warned that signing up with a claims management firm could mean borrowers lose up to 30% of any payout.Lewis said that his best guess was that lenders could end up shelling out £5bn-£15bn worth of compensation and that the number of borrowers likely to receive it would be in the “single-digit millions”.That would probably mean that most payouts would be in the high hundreds, rather than thousands, of pounds, he said.But Lewis said he did not believe the ruling was as negative for consumers as some people thought, given that a larger compensation bill could have pushed some firms into failure. “If those firms went bust, no one would get any compensation,” he said.It could also have resulted in fewer loans being available for consumers, including those who rely on credit. “So there was certainly potential consumer detriment, societal detriment, if the supreme court had upheld the full decision as well. So I think, certainly the chancellor will be pleased tonight.”The supreme court case was launched by two specialist lenders, Close Brothers and South Africa’s FirstRand, in an attempt to challenge the three consumers who collectivelywon the court of appeal case in October. Justices were asked to review the court of appeal ruling, which suggested nearly all commission arrangements – unless plainly disclosed and issued under full consent of the consumer – were unlawful.Lenders were concerned that the ruling went far beyond regulations set by the FCA, and vastly expanded a scandal that had previously focused on DCAs (discretionary commission arrangements), which werebanned in 2021.If upheld, it would also have meant millions of people and nearly anyone who bought a car with finance could be owed compensation. In the UK, about 80-90% of new cars, and a growing number of used vehicles, are bought with the help of loans.Analysts had estimated that the appeal court ruling could collectively cost lenders – including Santander UK, Close Brothers, Barclays and Lloyds – up to £44bn. That wouldhave nearly rivalledthe payment protection insurance(PPI) saga, which cost banks £50bn.The potential bill for industry had caused concern among Labour ministers. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, tried to intervene in January before the supreme court’s April hearing, urging judges to avoid handing “windfall” compensation to borrowers.The Guardian revealed last week that Reeves was consideringoverruling the supreme court’s decisionwith retrospective legislation, in order to help save lenders billions of pounds, in the event that it ruled in favour of consumers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is why we are already taking forward significant changes to the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Consumer Credit Act.“These reforms will deliver a more consistent and predictable regulatory environment for businesses and consumers, while ensuring that products are sold to customers fairly and clearly.”The Financing & Leasing Association (FLA), which lobbies on behalf of car lenders, had warned the government that a big bill could end up disrupting the market, forcing some lenders to shut up shop, offer fewer loans or raise interest rates.There were also fears it could expose lenders to complaints over commission payments across other financial products, such as appliances and furniture. The FLA said the supreme court decision was “an excellent outcome” that restored confidence to the sector.In a statement on Friday, Close Brothers said: “Close Brothers is considering the supreme court’s judgment and will make any further announcements as and when appropriate.”Peter Rothwell, the head of banking at KPMG UK, said the supreme court ruling provided “a clear path forward for lenders”. He added, however, that lenders should prepare for what was “still likely to be a significant customer redress exercise” under the FCA’s scheme.The supreme court said on Friday that the single case filed by Johnson was upheld due to the size of the commission – which was worth 55% of the total loan – and because documents did not explain that a single lender was offered right of first refusal, rather than him receiving the best deal from a panel of lenders.While Johnson failed to read the documents provided by the dealer, the supreme court noted that the borrower was “commercially unsophisticated, and the court questions the extent to which a finance company could reasonably expect a customer to have read and understood the detail of such documents, particularly when no prominence was given to the relevant statements.“For these reasons, the court holds that the relationship between Mr Johnson and the finance company was unfair. The other customers’ claims are rejected.”Explore more on these topicsUK supreme courtMotoringFinancial sectorBankingConsumer rightsConsumer affairsAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He has apologised “for any distress caused” and said the report cleared him of “the most serious and sensational accusations”.Torode was dropped as a presenter after he said he was the subject of a substantiated complaint over theuse of racist language, which he believes never happened.On Thursday the Guardian revealed thatone of the contestants from the latest series of MasterChef had been edited out of the programme, after telling its producers she did not want the show to be broadcast.Sarah Shafi, from Leeds, said she told the show’s producers that airing it would send the wrong message about the treatment of women.She said she initially rejected an offer by MasterChef’s producers, Banijay, to edit her out of her episode. The 57-year-old agreed to be removed once the BBC announced ithad decided to broadcast the series from 6 August.“I didn’t say edit me out,” she said. “I said: ‘Axe the show, don’t air the show. I’m asking you not to air the show.’ Prominent figures have been abusing their power. What message does that send out to women?”One formerMasterChefworker who said she had been groped by Wallace told BBC News the decision to broadcast the series showed “a blatant disregard for the people who have come forward”.Another person who worked on the show, and who said Wallace pulled his trousers down in front of her, said the decision to air the series was “profoundly disrespectful” to people who had made complaints. “It ultimately sends a message that such behaviour can be overlooked,” she said.Explore more on these topicsMasterChefGregg WallaceSexual harassmentBBCFood TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite the federal support, stations mostly rely on viewer donations, corporate sponsorships and local government support for the remainder.Rural communities face the biggest impact, as245 of the 544grantee organizations are considered rural and many may close without federal support which could affect educational programming, children’s shows and local news coverage. These rural stations also employ nearly 6,000 people, accordingto the CPB.Public broadcasting has historically served areas underserved by commercial media, providing emergency information during disasters and cultural programming not available elsewhere.Rural communities are already hard hit by a lack of community journalism, as one in three US counties do not have a full-time local journalist, according to aJuly reportfrom Muck Rack and Rebuild Local News.Most CPB staff will be terminated by September’s end, with a small transition team remaining through January 2026 to wind down operations.Donald Trump and Republican allies have long argued that taxpayer funding for public media represents unnecessary government spending, while claiming that PBS and NPR programming exhibits anti-conservative bias.TheTrump administrationhas also filed a lawsuit against three CPB board members who refused to leave their positions despite the president’s attempts to remove them.The closure ends nearly six decades of federal commitment to public broadcasting. The corporation was established by Congress in 1967 to ensure educational and cultural programming remained accessible to all Americans.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Many similar cases against Tesla have been dismissed and, when that didn’t happen, the company settled to avoid the spotlight of a trial.“This will open the floodgates,” Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer not involved in the Tesla case told the Associated Press. “It will embolden a lot of people to come to court.”The jury found that Tesla was 33% responsible for the crash that led to the death of 22-year-old Benavides Leon and injured her boyfriend, Angulo. The rest of the blame was placed on the driver, George Brian McGee.The jury ordered $129m in compensatory damages, of which Tesla will have to pay 33%, and $200m in punitive damages, to the estate of Benavides Leon and to Angulo.In his closing statements, Brett Schreiber, who represented the plaintiffs, accused Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its Autopilot technology and said that the company knew the autopilot function increased the likelihood its drivers would be distracted, according to the Washington Post.“The car they claimed to have invented didn’t exist,” Schreiber said during closing arguments on Thursday. “They knew all along that the Autopilot was defective.”“I trusted the technology too much,” McGee, the driver, said at one point in his testimony. “I believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.”Lawyers for Tesla argued in court that no car could have prevented the crash because the driver had been “reckless” and “aggressive”, according to theNew York Times.Schreiber acknowledged that McGee was negligent when he blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62mph before slamming into a Chevrolet Tahoe that the couple had parked to get a look at the stars.The Tahoe spun around so hard it was able to launch Benavides 75ft through the air into nearby woods where her body was later found. It also left Angulo, who walked into the courtroom on Friday with a limp and cushion to sit on, with broken bones and a traumatic brain injury.The case also included startling charges by lawyers for the family of the deceased and Angulo. They claimed Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the accident.Tesla has previously faced criticism that it is slow to produce crucial data by relatives of other victims in Tesla crashes, accusations that the car company has denied. In this case, the plaintiffs showed Tesla had the evidence all along, despite its repeated denials, by hiring a forensic data expert who dug it up. Tesla said it made a mistake after being shown the evidence and honestly had not thought it was there.Tesla said it would appeal the verdict. “Today’s verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla’s and the entire industry’s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,” the company said in astatement.In its statement, Tesla said it iswasonly responsible for 33% of the compensatory damages (so approximately $42.5m), and any punitive damages would be capped at three times that amount, at most.“To be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash,” the company said.The verdict may place a damper on the company’s ambitions to launch a driverless car-sharing service across the US. Musk has made several ambitious pronouncements about when the Robotaxi service will be available to Americans. Most recently, on Tesla’s earnings call, Tesla’s CEO said that he expected the car-sharing service to be available to half the US population by the end of this year.Already, Tesla has launched tests of the Robotaxi service in Austin and San Francisco. In the test phase, the cars still require a driver in the vehicle.This article was amended on 1 August 2025 because Tesla will have to pay $240m to the estate of Benavides Leon and to Angulo, not $329m as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskAutomotive industryRoad safetySelf-driving carsnewsShareReuse this content"

They had escaped after their arrests but were recaptured shortly thereafter.Ron Mitchell, a sailor in his 30s who was accused of being the ringleader, received two life sentences late on Wednesday in the killings of Ralph Hendry, 66, and Kathy Brandel, 71.Atiba Stanislaus, a farmer in his late 20s, received 60 years for manslaughter and nearly 18 years for the rape of Brandel, among other sentences for a variety of crimes including kidnapping.Trevon Robertson, an unemployed man in his early 20s, received 56 years for manslaughter and other sentences for different crimes, according to local media reports.The New Today, a local newspaper, reported that prosecutors said the menbound and gagged the couple before throwing them overboard, with Mitchell accused of steering the yacht over Hendry.The two bodies were never found.Police at the time said the men had escaped in late February 2024 from the South Saint George police station. They hijacked the catamaran Simplicity on the following day and then headed to nearby St Vincent, where they were arrested, according to authorities.The non-profit Salty Dawg Sailing Association had said that Hendry and Brandel were “veteran cruisers” and longtime members of the association, calling them “warm-hearted and capable”.It said the couple was spending the winter cruising in the easternCaribbean.Explore more on these topicsGrenadaCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The US lenders who cancelled their membership at the start of the year include JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.Barclays said in a statement on Friday afternoon: “After consideration, we have decided to withdraw from the Net ZeroBankingAlliance. With the departure of most of the global banks, the organisation no longer has the membership to support our transition.”On Thursday, the chief executive of Standard Chartered, Bill Winters, condemned rival banks for dropping their climate commitments amid mounting political pressure, saying:“Shame on them.”He criticised firms that had jumped on the climate bandwagon when it was “fashionable”, but had since rolled back on their green ambitions or gone quiet on the subject.“We are committed to our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050,” Barclays said, adding that its plans to issue $1tn (£750bn) in loans to fund sustainable projects and help firms transition to more climate-friendly operations “remain unchanged”.“We continue to work with our clients on their transition, finance the transition and scale climate tech, while helping to ensure energy security for our customers and clients,” the bank added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In itsmost recent report to parliament, the committee said: “Any plan to increase airport capacity needs to be based on realistic projections of future demand. These demand projections need to be consistent with climate change targets and take account of the costs to the sector of getting aviation to net zero emissions.”Campaigners do not believe it is possible for an expanded Heathrow to operate within the UK’s carbon budgets. Alethea Warrington, the head of aviation at the climate charity Possible, said: “It is unlikely that this expansion can be done within the current carbon budget as a new runway would bring additional flights, with a huge chunk of additional emissions, with no way of removing them.”View image in fullscreenA plane coming in to land at Heathrow. Campaigners say it is not possible for an expanded airport to operate within the UK’s carbon budgets.Photograph: Jed Leicester/Rex/ShutterstockDoug Parr, the policy director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Anyone who is serious about tackling climate change would be very cautious about making that problem even bigger without a coherent plan for dealing with it. Wishful thinking about future technological advances and cost reductions are not a coherent plan, and certainly not a plausible basis to allow the huge increase in emissions from a third runway at Heathrow. This policy amounts to announcing infrastructure now and kicking the carbon cost down the road for a future government to deal with.”Yet there could be alternatives if the government is brave enough to grasp them. The CCC has advised that the aviation sector should be forced to “pay for permanent engineered removals to balance out all remaining emissions”. That would be expensive – ways of permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, such as capturing the gas and storing it, are still under development.Simpler than that, why not substitute train journeys for flying? In 2021, there were more than3m flights within the UKbetween July to September alone and there are 15 flights a day to Brussels, which is just over two hours away by train from London.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

To encourage people on to trains instead of domestic flights, the government would need to make rail journeys cheaper or flights more expensive. The former would require investment, and the latter would annoy some middle-class voters.

But in the mid-20th century it vanished from British seashores, having been last found on Lundy, Devon, in 1954.View image in fullscreenThe jellyfish was discovered by Neil Roberts, who was rock-pooling on South Uist.Photograph: British WildlifeNeil Roberts, who made the original rediscovery after turning over a rock and examining some interesting-looking anemones and stalked jellyfish, described his “niggle of doubt” when he searched online and found his photos only matched somehistoric pen drawings and watercoloursof the species. But he said he was “well chuffed” when his photos were confirmed by experts to be the vanished jellyfish.Depastrum cyathiformewas recorded again by Guy Freeman, the editor ofBritish Wildlife magazine, who travelled to South Uist to conduct a follow-up search this summer.“When Neil first shared the photos it was like seeing a ghost,” said Freeman. “This thing that had only ever existed in old drawings was suddenly there, in the flesh. It is really encouraging that the jellyfish was still there this summer, two years after Neil’s find, but now we need to widen the search and work out whether it survives anywhere else.”There are50 stalked jellyfish known to science, with 10 found in British and Irish waters. A relative of the true jellyfish, sea anemones and corals, the stalked jellyfish is usually less than 5cm (2in) in height and uses a sucker to attach to rocks or seaweed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This enmity burst into view in 2011 – four years before he descended his golden escalator to announce he was running for US president – when Trump waged an unsuccessful battle to halt “ugly” offshore turbines visible from his Scottish golf course.In a sort of circular moment, Trump was back in Scotland earlier this week to fulminate once again about wind energy.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Donald Trump.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPA“Wind is a disaster,” the US president said in a press conference at his Turnberry golf course in Scotland, beside a doleful-lookingKeir Starmer. “You are paying massive subsidies to have these ugly monsters all over the place.”Starmer, for his part, said that “we believe in a mix” that includes wind but did not mention the pressing reason for clean energy – a climate crisis that is unleashing its fury in increasing bursts in the UK, US and elsewhere. Instead the British prime minister embraced the more Trump-friendly theme of energy security.But Trump’s distress at wind turbines now holds global,rather than merely golfing, implications. As president he has banned renewable energy projects from federal lands and signed a spending bill that kills off tax credits that were fostering a boom in new, clean energy supply.The amount of new clean energy additions is now expected to be half of what it would have been over the next decade as a result, with the added loss of several hundred thousand jobs and billions of dollars of investment that was set to gush into rural and exurban America. “It’s an expensive energy, it’s an ugly energy and we won’t allow it in the United States,” Trump boasted at his Scottish summit with Starmer.As the world’s second-largest carbon emitter, the US’s decision to bring the hammer down on renewables has major implications for a rapidly warming planet. Around 7bn tonnes of extra greenhouse gases are set to be added to the atmosphere in just the next five years – more than double India’s annual emissions – as American utilities turn to gas and coal rather than cleaner sources of energy.Clean energy still remains remarkably attractive – wind and solar have plummeted in cost over the past decade and are now almost always cheaper than fossil fuels even without subsidies,as the United Nations pointed outlast week. Almost all new electricity capacity in the US is set to come from renewables this year – after all, it’s not only cheaper but far quicker to start up a windfarm than a gas plant.But the climate crisis has always been a timed challenge. Even as renewables advance, they must do so far faster if the world has a chance of fending off spiralling climate disasters. The fixation of one man in the White House is stamping on the brakes at the very moment when scientists are urging accelerated cuts in emissions.The backtracking on renewables also poses geopolitical, as well as environmental, questions. China, which Trump often disparages as a rival, is already streaking ahead of the world in erecting wind and solar facilities and envisions a future run on clean energy that it will then sell to other countries – a Chinese EV in the garage overlooked by a Chinese-made windfarm in the hills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Dressed in a blue dressing gown and with bare feet, he took the mic, described the choir’s singing as a “terrible racket” and told them to get out.“You are in my house, can you leave it now please,” he said.In avideoposted on social media, the bishop can be seen telling the choir it is past 10pm and calls for the night to be “over”.On Wednesday, Baker issued a written apology to “all the members of the City Academy Choir”, which was seen by the Guardian, for bringing the concert to a “premature end”.“I write to apologise for the distress and offence which I caused on Friday evening in bringing the City Voices concert to a premature end. This should not have happened, I take full responsibility and apologise unreservedly,” he said.“I also apologise for remarks which were made in haste and which have understandably caused hurt and distress.”St Andrew church is available to hire as an events venue. The choir had booked the space until 11pm but Baker appeared shortly after 10pm. Addressing this, Baker said: “I accept that you had made a booking for the site until 11pm. My understanding that the performance would cease at 10pm was mistaken and I apologise for this too.“I have lived here on site at St Andrew’s for 10 years, for much of which City Academy has rehearsed and performed here. You have been, and continue to be, welcome and I hope that you will be able to continue the relationship with us.“I can give you every assurance that the events of Friday evening will not recur and I apologise again to performers (especially those unable to perform at the end of the evening) and audience alike.”Among those denied a finale was Raj Swamy, 33. He was getting ready to sing his solo, Reach Out I’ll Be There, when he noticed the bishop opening the door behind him and switching off the lights.“It was an odd experience. It was just before I was about to sing. I never thought a bishop would be the reason I didn’t have a solo that night,” hetold the Times.The final song on the choir’s setlist was going to be a fully staged rendition of Abba’s Dancing Queen. After Baker demanded everyone leave, outrage bubbled up and the choir began performing an a cappella version on stage, before finishing it on their way out to a loud, rapturous reception.Leigh Stanford Thompson, the director of the choir, called the incident “bizarre”. By chance, it was also his last concert in the role. “We had a really good concert but I think it’s a real shame that we didn’t get a chance to finish. But now looking back, what a way to go out,” he said.Explore more on these topicsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Ricardo Junior was playful, kind, and always smiling. They brought so much love, laughter, and energy into the lives of everyone around them. Their absence has left an unbearable silence not just for their parents, but for their whole family, who were incredibly close and shared an unbreakable bond.”Kayla Jasvinder Del-Brocco, the children’s aunt, toldBirminghamLiveher niece and nephew had been swept away from the beach by powerful currents. “They went out to swim together with their dad as they loved the beach. Mum said ‘don’t be long’ and took her little one to the bathroom. She came back out and couldn’t see anyone. That’s when the nightmare commenced.”Emergency services were called to Llarga beach, near Tarragona, shortly after 8.45pm local time on Tuesday, Catalonia’s civil protection agency has said. Ricardo Senior remains in hospital after being pulled from the water unconscious, it was reported.Jose Luis Gargallo, the head of the local police force in Salou, said on Wednesday: “There were three people who were having serious difficulty getting out of the sea. There was a father with his son and daughter, of British nationality.“When they got out, both of them, the boy and girl, aged 11 and 13, showed no signs of life. Attempts were made to resuscitate them with CPR, but they were unsuccessful.“The father, fortunately, was able to be saved. He had swallowed a lot of water, he was exhausted, very fatigued, but the father was able to be saved thanks to the emergency services.”A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of two British children who have died inSpainand are in contact with the local authorities.”Marquis-Johnson has set up a fundraiser to help with the cost of repatriation.Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The 63-year-old charity worker was murdered by a “jealous” tradesman he employed to help decorate the property in preparation for a family visit in summer 2018.Dwayne Barton, 32, was jailed for 27 years and his accomplice, Davian Edwards, 33, for 22 years this week after being found guilty of murder in a trial at St Mary circuit court in Jamaica.Walker, who was born on the island, was 11 years old when he moved to Britain with his parents who were part of the Windrush generation. He worked as a carpenter, builder and a school caretaker but had always dreamed of returning to Jamaica to retire, which he did in November 2017.Steve Walker, 59, said his brother had found a beautiful seafront house and hired local tradespeople to help him restore it in preparation for his family visiting from Britain. He had been keen to employ people nearby because he had been “very much about supporting the local community”.View image in fullscreenSteve Walker, the brother of Delroy Walker, said a UK official initially told him the government could not help him because ‘your brother’s not British, or not British enough’.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianHowever, the trial heard that the retiree had become involved in a minor dispute with one of the men, Barton, who returned to the property and stabbed him to death as “payback” in April 2018.Delroy Walker’s murder came weeks before the fatal stabbing of the British retirees Gayle and Charlie Anderson, 71 and 74, from Manchester, and sparked warnings that those returning from Britain were beingdeliberately targeted. Jamaican policebolstered securityin response.After the sentencing on Tuesday, Steve Walker, a former BBC technician from Croydon in south London, said he hoped the lengthy prison sentences would show that “Jamaica will tolerate this no longer”.He said his brother had been a generous and loving man who had been so excited to welcome his family on a trip from Britain that was weeks away when he was murdered.He said: “We’ve had justice, which is what we’ve been striving for since the day his life was taken in that cruel way … [but] it’s left an emptiness. I like Jamaica but my brother loved Jamaica. He should be here. I should be sharing these moments and sharing paradise with him.”Walker’s family said they would request a meeting with the British Foreign Office over what they described as the “indifferent” way his murder had been treated by the high commission in Kingston.Steve Walker said a UK official had told him initially that the government could not help them because “your brother’s not British, or not British enough, because he had a dual passport”.“It was shocking to the core and it still shocks me,” he said. “I felt disgust and upset. It was time when we needed that support.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Walker’s family had requested the British government’s help to expedite the process but received “very little, very late and often nothing at all”, said his sister Jackie Ward.Ward, from Surrey, said she believed the high commission treated the family as not British because her brother had had a dual Jamaica-British passport, even though he had spent most of his life in the UK and his family still live there.She said: “If it had been a person from Oxford or Surrey, a white British family, who had been killed, I highly suspect their response and support would have been different.“They were indifferent about it. It’s far from good enough. It’s a systemic problem.”Ward said no British government official had contacted them since the trial and had not attended the court hearings as promised, she said, despite the murder warranting interventions from Jamaica’s director of public prosecutions and receiving national media coverage in both countries.The Foreign Office said: “We have supported the family since Mr Walker’s death and remain available for consular assistance.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyRaceJamaicaCrimeAmericasBirminghamCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

The definition of working class will be based on what jobs were held by their parents when the applicant was 14 and replaces an existing programme open to all.The Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, said the action was being taken because applicants from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were less likely to get a place on the so-called fast stream.“We need to get more working-class young people into the civil service so it harnesses the broadest range of talent and truly reflects the country,” he said. “Government makes better decisions when it represents and understands the people we serve.“I want to open up opportunities for students from all backgrounds, and in every corner of the UK, so they can take a leading role at the heart of government as we rewire the state and deliver the plan for change.”Whitehall’s ambition to cut costs using AI is fraught with riskRead moreThe two-month summer programme will give 200 undergraduates the opportunity to work in a civil service department from next year, with applications starting this October.Their placement work could include planning events, writing briefings for ministers, shadowing senior civil servants and carrying out research for policy development. They will also be allocated a “buddy” who is a current fast-streamer and get access to skills sessions.Participants who perform well will be fast-tracked to the final stages of the fast-stream selection process if they decide to apply for a job after graduation.There is a standard government definition of someone’s socioeconomic status based on parental occupation, worked out under criteria from the Office for National Statistics.The main question is whether the highest earner in the household when a person was 14 was: a modern professional such as a teacher or nurse; clerical such as a secretary; senior manager; technical worker such as a motor mechanic; semi-routine manual such as a postal worker or security guard; routine manual such as a van driver or cleaner; junior/middle manager such as a publican or retail supervisor; or in a traditional professional occupations such as an accountant or solicitor. Other questions involve whether the highest earning parent was employed or self-employed, and whether they supervised others.People with parents whose occupations were receptionist, electrician, plumber or van driver would be likely to qualify as working class.The most recent data shows only about one in 10 successful applicants to the fast-stream graduate programme come from the lowest income backgrounds. The fast-stream programme was suspended briefly in 2023 as a cost-cutting measure but has since been reinstated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kemi Badenoch said: “Under my leadership, a Conservative government would scrap all this rubbish and just hire the best people.”Ministers have pledged tocut the size of the civil service, with tens of thousands of roles estimated to go over the coming years. New figures show it has grown to a 20-year high of almost 550,000 people as of March this year, with most manager level or above and the growth attributed to more operational frontline roles.Explore more on these topicsCivil serviceSocial exclusionClass issuesGraduate careersInequalityLabourStudentsnewsShareReuse this content"

FPC Bryan isdescribedas a “minimum security federal prison camp” that houses 635 female inmates.According to the Bureau of Prisons’ inmate locator, the Texas facility is also home toElizabeth Holmes, the disgraced former CEO of the California-based blood-testing companyTheranos, who is serving a lengthysentencefor fraud. Real Housewives of Salt Lake City TV star Jen Shah is also serving time therefor fraud.Maxwell’s move from FCI Tallahassee, alow-security prison, to the federal prison camp in Bryan comes roughly a week after she was interviewed in Floridaover two daysabout the Epstein case by the deputy US attorney general, Todd Blanche, who is also one of Donald Trump’s former lawyers.Virginia Giuffre wanted Epstein documents made public, siblings sayRead moreBlanche had said that he wanted to speak with Maxwell – who was sentenced in 2022for sex trafficking and other related crimes– to see if she might have “information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims”.Details of that meeting have not been made public but Maxwell’s lawyer described it as“very productive”, adding thatMaxwell answeredthe questions “honestly, truthfully, to the best of her ability”.The interview took place amid growing political and public pressure on the Trump administration to release additional federal documents related to the Epstein case – a case which has, for years, been the subject of countless conspiracy theories.Earlier in July, the justice department drew bipartisan criticism and backlash after announcing that itwould not be releasingany more documents from the investigation into the late Epstein, whodied in prisonin New York in 2019 while awaiting federal trial. This was despiteearlier pledgesto release more files, by the US president and the US attorney general, Pam Bondi.Last week, the House of Representatives committee on oversight and government reformsubpoenaed Maxwellto testify via deposition later this month. In response, Maxwell’s lawyersent a letterto lawmakers this week stating that Maxwell was willing to testify but only if certain conditions are met, including being granted immunity. In that same letter, Maxwell also made a plea for clemency.But on Friday, the House indefinitely postponed that deposition.Meanwhile, Maxwell haspetitionedthe US supreme court to overturn her conviction.Explore more on these topicsGhislaine MaxwellJeffrey EpsteinUS prisonsSex traffickingUS crimeTexasFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

They have also raised fears of inflation in the US.Rates were set at 25% for India’s US-bound exports, 20% for Taiwan and 30% for South Africa. Switzerland faces a rate of 39%. The deadline for a tariff deal with Mexico was extended by another 90 days.Stock markets fell on both sides of the Atlantic, after earlier falls in Asia, amid investors fears about the impact on the global economy. Europe’s Stoxx 600 was down nearly 2% while the UK’s FTSE 100 was down 0.8%. Wall Street closed lower, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 down over 1% and Nasdaq down more than 2%. The sell-off was exacerbated byweaker than expected jobs figuresin the US.Switzerland and chip powerhouse Taiwan are scrambling to negotiate deals after being hit by rates of 39% – one of the highest in the world – and 20% respectively.Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, said his government was “disappointed” by Trump’s decision to increase US tariffs on Canadian goods from 25% to 35% with immediate effect – on the grounds Canada had failed to crack down on fentanyl and to increase border security.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said he would use the week to “negotiate as strongly and as hard as we can” to reduce a crippling 30% duty on goods.Some of the world’s poorest and struggling countries were hit with punitive rates, including Syria, which faces a levy of 41%. Laos and Myanmar were hammered with rates of 40%; Libya, 30%; Iraq, 35% and Sri Lanka 20%.Would-be EU member states were blindsided by punitive rates: Moldova 25%, Serbia 35% and Bosnia and Herzogovina30%.There was some reprieve for Lesotho, a country that Trump described a state that “nobody has ever heard of” when halting USAid. It was facing 50% tariffs, an existential threat to its textile industry but came out on Friday with a 15% rate.Lesotho’s$2bn economy is heavily dependent on duty-free exports to the US. The tiny African country declared a national state of disaster after the 50% rate was declared.The Swiss franc touched its weakest in six weeks after being hit with one of the highest tariffs in the world, 39%, while the Canadian dollar was set for a seventh straight weekly loss.Karin Keller-Sutter, the Swiss president, who was celebrating the country’s national day, said she had spoken to Trump on Thursday but that “no agreement could be reached”.Pharma accounts for 50% of Swiss exports to the US, which may have been Trump’s target.Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said Switzerland got the rough end of Trump’s trade war. “The Swiss rate was a shock, and the Swiss government have said that they plan to keep negotiating with the US to secure a lower levy. Chocolatiers, watchmakers and pharma companies are all under threat,” she said.Conspicuous as the only two trading partners listed at a 10% rate were the UK, the first to get a deal with Trump, and the Falkland Islands.The EU’s 15% tariff rate as a single all-inclusive rate was confirmed in the executive order.In a setback to the EU, cars were left out in the executive order. They are currently being taxed at 27.5%, with many EU car companies resuming deliveries to customers in the US after last Sunday’s deal with Trump.The new specific rates will apply seven days after the date of the executive order, starting on 8 August. For goods already in transit or warehoused for consumption before 8 August, the previous tariff rate (10% + MFN rate) will apply until 5 October 2025.Pharmaceuticals were conspicuous by their absence, given the White House said it had agreed a 15% rate on Monday, hours after Trump sealed the deal with the EU at his Scottish golf course.Pharma chiefs, who have been in Trump’s crosshairs for months, were warned to reduce their prices to US patients by the US president. If they refused to, the federal government would “deploy every tool” in its arsenal to protect American families, the White House said.Brazil’s tariff rate was set at 10%, but a previous order placed a 40% tariff on topunish the country for prosecuting its former president, Jair Bolsonaro.Cambodia appeared to be close to reaching a deal after it said it would drop all tariffs on imports from the US and order up to 20 Boeing 737s.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsInternational tradeGlobal economyTariffsEconomicsDonald TrumpMarket turmoilnewsShareReuse this content"

The move means “life-saving research” will be defunded, he said.“It is a loss for Americans across the nation whose work, health, and future depend on the groundbreaking work we do.”Antisemitism training designed by pro-Israel groups is becoming compulsory at US colleges. What’s in it?Read moreFrenk did not say the value of the grants, but theLos Angeles Timesreported that roughly 300 grants amounting to nearly $200m were suspended.The federal government has moved to pull billions of dollars from prominent universities across the US after accusing the institutions of failing to adequately respond to antisemitism during pro-Palestinian protests, and referred some to the Department of Justice. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has reached agreements withBrown Universityand Columbia University to restore funding and close investigations into the schools.The agreement with Brown requires the institution to commit to nondiscrimination in admissions and programs, and allow the administration access to admissions data. Meanwhile, Columbia’s controversialdealrequires it pay more than$220m, expand its Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies, review Middle East curriculum and cut programs promoting “unlawful efforts” related to diversity. Harvard remains in a legal fight with the federal government over its move to freeze billions in federal funds.The news out of UCLA comes days after the school reached a nearly$6.5m settlementin a lawsuit by Jewish students and a professor who said the university allowed antisemitic discrimination to take place on campus during protests last year.Earlier this week, the Department of Justice notified the University ofCaliforniathat its investigation found that UCLA’s response to a protest encampment in spring 2024 was “deliberately indifferent to a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students” and that students experienced “severe [and] pervasive” harassment.In his statement about the grant cancellations, Frenk said the university had taken steps to combat antisemitism, and ensure the school is safe and welcoming for all, including the creation of a new Office of Campus and Community Safety and an Initiative to Combat Antisemitism.He also highlighted the university’s history of research, including planetary scientists who search for asteroids that could pose a threat to Earth, a Valley Fever Center and the role researchers played in helping create the internet.“This far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothingto address any alleged discrimination,” Frenk wrote.Explore more on these topicsUS universitiesTrump administrationUS politicsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, she’s back with a new record and a newfound sense of peaceFri 1 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 09.36 EDTShareOn Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage in June,Celesteappeared wearing smeared black eye makeup and a leather jacket moulded with the impression of feathers, latched at the throat. She evoked glamour and tragedy, a bird with its wings clipped. “My first album came out nearly five years ago and I didn’t expect it to take so long,” she said of its follow-up. “But I’m here now.”Celeste broke through in 2020, her voice reminiscent of Billie Holiday’s racked beauty, but sparkling with a distinctly British lilt: a controlled, powerful vibrato that stirs the soul. Despite her jazz-leaning balladry not being obvious chart fodder, she became the first British female act in five years to reach No 1 with her debut album,Not Your Muse, which was nominated for the Mercury prize. She also won the BBC’s Sound of 2020 poll and the Brit award for rising star and was nominated for an Oscar for best original song (for Hear My Voice fromThe Trial of the Chicago 7) the year after – but her chance to capitalise on those accolades was stalled by the pandemic. She had to halt her touring ambitions. Of the years since, she says: “Sometimes you worry: are you on your path?”Celeste was haunting and spectacular when I saw her at Glastonbury, but now, as we stroll through Hyde Park in central London, she is relaxed and laughs easily. She becomes distracted by a carousel ride – “They’re my favourite! I love the music” – then she is back to talking about the five-year struggle to make her excellent second album, Woman of Faces, which will be released in November.View image in fullscreenHaunting and spectacular … Celeste on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury in June.Photograph: Jaimi Joy/Reuters“The title was kind of a diagnosis of how I feel sometimes; a device to help me begin to understand my own complexity,” she says. She was born Celeste Waite in California to a mother from Dagenham, east London, and a Jamaican father. Her mother had found her way to Hollywood as a makeup artist and Celeste was born “quite quickly” after her parents met there. They separated when Celeste turned one and she and her mother moved to England to live in Celeste’s grandparents’ home. “It was almost like my mother was my sister, because we were both being looked after by my nan and grandad.”These are happy memories, but she has “these different weathers in my brain … I’ve always had this little tinge of melancholy.” Maybe, she says, it stems in part from a lack of rootedness: “You move from America to England and you don’t really remember it, but you know that there’s people that you’ve known there and built connections with. And then you don’t have that.” She wondered if she would end up with a mental health diagnosis, “something more clinical later on down the line. But I didn’t feel I really needed that.” Instead, she found solace in other artists’ music, “people’s lyrics and emotions and melodies, even how they dress themselves – that’s always been quite a big remedy without needing to have a professional”.While she is frequently compared to Adele and Amy Winehouse, unlike them Celeste did not attend the Brit school of performing arts, instead studying music technology at sixth-form college in Brighton and working in a pub as she got her career off the ground. “I’m really glad I taught myself to sing,” she says, arguing that it gives her “rawness and authenticity”. Her venture into music was galvanised by the death of her father from lung cancer when she was 16: “When you lose someone, every day you wake up and you’re stunned by the fact that they’re gone. And there’s a certain point where you say to yourself: I can’t do this any more, and that’s when you start to either go to the gym or get into a practice. For me, that was where I picked up music and became really focused.”People’s lyrics, emotions and melodies, even how they dress themselves – that’s always been quite a big remedyIn the mid-2010s, she started uploading music to YouTube and SoundCloud and got a manager. She was picked up as a guest vocalist for producers such as Avicii, while Lily Allen’s label released her debut single. “I worked double shifts in a pub on weekends to afford to go to the studio,” she says. “It took my energy away and I wasn’t able to sing as well any more.”But she carried on doggedly, got signed to the major label Polydor, bagged the 2020 John Lewis Christmas ad soundtrack and beguiled listeners on songs such as Strange, in which her vocal tone expresses every contradictory emotion in a breakup – resignation, hurt, bafflement, poignancy, even a kind of helpless amusement at how awful it all is – in just four minutes.She is clear that she has received plenty of support and encouragement within Polydor: “The people that signed me came into music with the intention to make meaningful, poignant, credible music.” But at the commercial end of the industry, there is still “a huge pressure to make money. If you’re not in the top 2% of acts who have such a huge fanbase, you maybe don’t get the freedom” to do adventurous work. She says that developing her initial sound caused friction. “I was hanging around all these jazz musicians likeSteam DownandNubya Garcia, real innovators, and it wasn’t easy for me to go into the label and be like: this is what I want to do.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m really glad I taught myself to sing’ … at a pre-Oscars show in Los Angeles in 2021.Photograph: Richard Harbaugh/Rex/ShutterstockShe has managed to preserve a sense of strangeness and singularity. Unlike her earlier peppy soul-pop hit Stop This Flame, familiar to millions as backing music on Sky Sports, most of the songs on Woman of Faces don’t even feature percussion – almost unthinkable in 21st-century pop – and there aren’t many British singers on major labels doing symphonic jazz. She wanted “a cinematic feel” and referencedBernard Herrmann– a composer for films by Hitchcock, Welles and Scorsese – in the studio as she worked with the conductor Robert Ames and the London Contemporary Orchestra. “Herrmann was a real innovator and it’s reflected in people like Busta Rhymes sampling him [on Gimme Some More] all those years later. So we wanted to make sure that if we went into that territory of a cinematic string orchestra, it didn’t feel like an impression of the 1950s – it sounded like something new.”With this ambitious scope and Celeste shuttling between sessions in Los Angeles and London, it took a lot longer than expected to complete Woman of Faces. It was originally due to be finished by the end of 2022 and released a year later. “I didn’t expect it to take so long,” she says. “And if I’m really honest with you, at the end of 2021, into 2022, I experienced some heartache and I fell into such a depression about it all.”Watch the video for On With the Show.A relationship had ended. “When you lose the person from your life that you really love, there’s a grief that comes over you,” she says. The album’s first single, On With the Show, was written at her lowest point. “I didn’t really want to go to the studio; I didn’t really feel like I actually wanted to live at that point. I didn’t find meaning and purpose in the music.” She just had the song title, which she shared with her collaborator Matt Maltese. “I didn’t even have to explain to him what it would be about, because he just knew. We spoke about the song and what it needed to be.”She had also recently seen Marius Petipa’s1898 classical ballet Raymonda. “It’s about a woman in the Crimean war and she has two lovers: one is in Russia and one is in Crimea,” she says. “I could relate, because she was torn between these two entities: at that point, my dedication to music and my dedication to a person. And one was taking the energy from the other. So On With the Show was about me having to find the courage to let go of something, to meet back in with the path of my life as a singer.”Worse, she says, “social media had come in to erode my relationship”. As a public figure on social media, “people can view your relationship and have so much awareness of the fact that you’re even in one. There’s this really strange, invisible, intangible impression that interactions in that space can leave upon your living reality. I was upset at how much that had come to affect my personal, real life.” On Could Be Machine, a curveball industrial pop song inspired by Lady Gaga, Celeste explores the idea that “the more time we spend with this technology, the more we become it”.When you lose the person you really love, a grief comes over you. I didn’t find meaning and purpose in the music“My phone had become this antagonist in my life, via communication that I didn’t want to receive and the fact it could just be in your hand. It was quite alien, in a way. I hadn’t grown up with a phone stuck to my hand and it was something that I had to become more and more ‘one’ with in my music career.”She says that, during the relationship, love had reverted her to a kind of “child-like state … a really pure version of yourself, before the world has seeped in and shaped you”. Losing the person who brought her into that state meant that she had to “learn how to steer and guide” herself to rediscover it.She is leaning on other musicians to help her understand these difficult years. She cites Nina Simone’s song Stars, a ballad about the cruelty and melancholy of being a professional musician. “It says so much about the tragedy of where her life is at that moment in time, but then there’s so much triumph in the fact she even gets to express herself in that way.” Another inspiration for Woman of Faces was the 1951 musical romantic comedyAn American in Parisand one of its stars, Oscar Levant, who spent time in mental health institutions. “I was really moved by what he seemed to carry in his being. And, I suppose, I relate a lot to artists who carry this pain, but their work eases it.”View image in fullscreen‘I relate a lot to artists who carry pain’ … at a Bafta fundraiser in London in 2024.Photograph: Carlo Paloni/Bafta/Getty ImagesWhereas Celeste was previously in thrall to American blues and R&B (“the older sense of what R&B was in the 1940s”), down to the way she might “time things and phrase things and even pronounce things”, she has “learned what my true voice is and who I really am as a person. I still have some of that phrasing and pronunciation there, but I exist a lot more as myself, therefore I sing a lot more as myself.”Buoyed up by her and others’ art, does she feel happy? “Yes!” She grins and throws her hands in the air. “The main thing is finding happiness within the relationships I maintain around me and making sure those are kept really positive and nourishing.” She is glad to be in her 30s: “Age becomes kind of taboo for a woman in the music industry – but then you hear people like Solange speak about women really coming into their true sense of who they are within their work. There’s been a shift.”And if the happiness in her career ever dissipates, she has decided she will simply move on. “I don’t really see the need to live in a feeling of oppression, when I know there’s so much freedom outside this world. And anyway, I’m sure I would find my way back to it again. But on my own terms.”Woman of Faces is released on 14 November on PolydorIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

But what caused the slowdown, and is it a victory for ‘real’ cinema?Fri 1 Aug 2025 07.54 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 12.46 EDTShareFed up with all those superhero movies cluttering up the multiplexes and forcing your delicate black-and-white Lithuanian goat-herding tragedy on to a single screen at 10am on a Tuesday? Angry,like Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, that a $300m CGI raccoon gets more screen time than the slow and haunting meditation on existential despair your favourite auteur spent a decade working on?For you, then, the darkest days of comic book movie hegemony may be over. A quick peek at the theatrical release calendar suggests that there is not a single new major-studio superhero flick due to hit multiplexes in the next six months. That’s right, a full, blissful half a year – which hasn’t happened since May 2011. For years, the anti-comic-book brigade have insisted superhero movies are sucking the oxygen out of cinema and killing originality. Now, the great superhero drought of 2025 makes it look as though their side has finally prevailed. And maybe, after the best part of two decades of interchangeable third-act rubble fights and billionaire orphans growling about destiny, that’s as it should be.For those of us who are really rather fond of superheroes on the big screen, however, it feels like a worry. Six long months with no multiverse chaos or retconned origin stories?. What is going on? Is the comic book movie really dead? Did audiences finally get superhero fatigue? Or could it just be that the studios looked at their balance sheets, rememberedMadame Webhappened, and decided to give us all a six-month palate cleanse before trying again?View image in fullscreenDisaster movie … remember Madame Web?Photograph: Jessica Kourkounis/Courtesy of Sony PicturesThe truth is that the gaping desert in the release schedule where quite a few superhero movies would usually be is the result of a perfect storm of misfires, budget panic and inter-studio meltdowns. DC fired its last cinematic universe into the sun (and hasn’t given James Gunn much time to get its new one into shape), Sony quietly strangled its live-action Spider-Man spinoff plans after Kraven the Hunterflopped. And Marvel, once the unshakeable titan, has begun watching its pennies too.Reports in Hollywoodsuggest the studio’s big plan for Phase 7 is to finally introduce the X-Men into the MCU, but with cheaper, younger unknowns rather than the expensive A-listers that permeated the 20th Century Fox films. This is partly because China no longer loves Hollywood cinema like it did in the halcyon, pre-Covid era, and partly because any studio that makes such eye-wateringly expensive duds as Eternals, Ant-Man: Quantumania and The Marvels is bound to have to consider cost-cutting issues sooner rather than later.Ironically, last month Gunn delivered Superman, the first well-reviewed film about a major DC titan since Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman in 2017. Marvel looks to be getting back on track following early box-office success forFantastic Four: First Steps, which has also been well-reviewed. But just as one swallow does not a summer make, two vaguely competent superhero movies don’t magically erase a decade-long franchise hangover. The superhero slowdown isn’t just about artistic self-reflection. It’s a combination of bruised egos, battered spreadsheets, and the realisation that studios have relentlessly mined every character in the Marvel and DC back issues, including that one guy who appeared for two panels in a 1973 issue of Spider-Man whose power was talking to lightbulbs.View image in fullscreenEarly success … Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm and Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards in Fantastic Four: First Steps.Photograph: Marvel Studios/PAThe issue is basic box office maths. There was a time before Covid when you could slap a cape on an actor, throw in a Stan Lee cameo, and reliably hoover up a billion dollars before lunch. Now? Global audiences, particularly in China, have stopped treating every MCU release like a religious festival. And once your international market yawns, suddenly all those $250m CGI slugfests look less like guaranteed jackpots and more like prestige vanity projects in tights.The Fantastic Four: First Steps – the best origins movie Marvel has made in years? Discuss with spoilersRead moreThe other elephant in the room is that streaming blew a hole in the business model. During the pandemic, Disney+ and HBO Max became superhero graveyards, funnelling B-tier projects to streaming audiences, and teaching them they could just wait a few weeks and then watch at home. The illusion of urgency – the idea that you had to see every film on opening weekend or risk missing the next puzzle piece – now seems ridiculous.Which brings us to the current vacuum, which may be less the heroic victory for cinema some may have hoped for, and more an emergency reset button. We may get six glorious months free from multiverse migraines and quippy alien invasions. But don’t kid yourself: it’s just Hollywood taking a breath and trying to figure out how to sell you more superhero movies next year.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekSuperhero moviesMarvelDC ComicscommentShareReuse this content"

Fans and collaborators like Michael Palin, Woody Allen and Lesley Anne-Down explain whyAs told toAndrew PulverFri 1 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 12.58 EDTShare‘He made me so happy I forgot about my spots’Michael PalinAlong withSpike Milligan, Peter Sellers lit up my teenage years. I knew that Connie Francis would never return my love, but Spike and Peter delivered something almost as good – and that was deep, satisfying and highly contagious laughter. Laughter that made me so happy I forgot about my spots.Spike was the imaginative genius who wrote The Goon Show but it was Sellers who brought me to tears with his gallery of unforgettable characters: Major Bloodnok, Bluebottle, Henry Crun, Hercules Grytpype-Thynne.He was my hero long before I knew what he looked like. On my first day at Oxford university, I made a lifetime friendship founded on a mutual adoration of the album Songs for Swingin Sellers (with a pair of legs swinging from a branch on the cover). Sellers was not just a man of many voices, he was a gifted actor, and each voice came with a character. The more I heard him the more I wanted to be like him. He showed me there was something far more important than sport and girls and modern history class, and that was making people laugh.‘His funniness was just magically there’Woody AllenAll I can say about Peter was that apart from all his character skills and voices and technical brilliance, he had a built-in funny quality and made you laugh the minute he appeared on screen. It’s nothing you can learn and very few even successful comics have it. I’m sure there was nothing he could do to produce it or understand it himself. It was just magically there, that funniness.‘I remember thinking: “Is it­ ­possible to die from laughing?”’Sanjeev BhaskarWhen I was a kid, my parents and their friends would have these dinner parties, for want of a better term, where the children were all fed first and then shoved into a room with the telly. One night, a film called The Party came on the TV, the one where Sellers plays an Indian actor. I watched it and I remember thinking: “Is it possible to die from laughing?” Because I was laughing so much I was in pain.It’s a controversial film now but I still love it, in the same way that I always defend It Ain’t Half Hot Mum. We’re living in a time where people strip things of context, and either celebrate or denigrate things. But for me his performance was so funny and it was so deftly done. Given its time, I don’t find anything offensive about it. I think, crucially, he wasn’t trying to be offensive. He had already played an Indian character in The Millionairess with Sophia Loren and that was why I suggested their song title, Goodness Gracious Me, for our sketch show, because it’s reclaiming it. It sounds more grand than it really was, but we were trying to suggest a changing of the guard. But again, I wasn’t offended as a child and I’m not offended as an adult. I think it’s of its time. You wouldn’t do that now – you’d find a good Asian actor to play the part – but I always had an affection for him.View image in fullscreen‘It’s controversial now, but I still love it’ … Peter Sellers in The Party.Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto/AllstarI think of the 10 years after The Ladykillers (1955) as peak Sellers, untilDr Strangelove(1964) – a work of genius. That period includes the first two Pink Panther films, The Pink Panther (1963) and A Shot in the Dark (1964), which is, I think, my favourite Clouseau. His brilliance until then is to do with the precision of his performances in terms of character, of vocalising and comic timing. Maybe he was trying to prove himself – his Fred Kite in I’m All Right Jack is a performance without ego. Then he suddenly became a global star, and I think that status meant he became less precise in his performances – until we get to Being There which was him back to his best: a really precise, detailed performance.There is a lot that has been written and said about Sellers and what always stuck with me was that his big fear was if you stripped away his characters you wouldn’t find anything there. Blake Edwards said he had the best working times ever with him – and the worst. So I think that he was obviously a complicated person but when you look at it in terms of sheer talent, he was blessed. I don’t think there’s ever been a better comic actor.‘I met him for dinner – it was like going to meet the queen’Lesley-Anne DownMy father, like the rest of the country, absolutely adored The Goon Show, and I grew up listening to it. When I did The Pink Panther Strikes Again in 1976, I was working with an icon – I mean, not even human, he was like a god. The first time I met him was in Munich. The publicist on the movie said Peter wants to have dinner with you, and I remember they were really tense about it. They said: don’t do this, and don’t say that, and, you know, just be a certain way. It was like going to meet the queen. It made me very tense as well, but within five minutes we just hit it off. Obviously I was a bit younger than he was, he was my dad’s age, but we got on exceptionally well. And unlike any amount of men that I have worked with or come into contact with on both sides of the camera, he was a total gentleman for the entire shoot.And it was a very long shoot. Today it would have taken about three weeks, but because it was Peter it was 14 weeks. He’d just be laughing and playing jokes and tricks all day long, sometimes we never actually got a shot completed. We hung out basically day and night for 14 weeks. The crew was huge. It must have cost a fortune but everyone was on board with it, it was like being at a comedy show. Everybody laughing, everybody having fun. I mean, it really was an amazing experience.View image in fullscreenSellers and Lesley-Anne Down in The Pink Panther Strikes Again.Photograph: United Artists/Kobal/ShutterstockHe didn’t sleep very much, he liked to stay up all night and end up in the clubs. He loved [vocal ensemble]The Manhattan Transfer, which at the time was a great sound. He smoked a bit of dope, too. I don’t think Peter really liked himself particularly, but a lot of comedians are that way. They’re depressed and they cover it up with laughter. He was always searching for happiness, and people didn’t take tremendous care of themselves back then. Nobody said, I’ve got to go to the gym or the treadmill; people just ate and drank what they wanted and did what they wanted.I knew there was a side of Peter that could be difficult or disruptive. I had been told about it, but I don’t remember any of that. I think there was one day that Peter and Blake [Edwards] were sitting in their chairs on set, and they were a little bit tense and not talking to each other. I don’t know what that was about, I wasn’t privy to it. But that was the only time that I ever saw anything. I didn’t see Peter being cross or upset or nasty or anything. I only saw his funny, jolly, kind side. We got on like a house on fire. He was a genius. Seriously, what a career.‘When he did films for directors that knew enough to give him freedom, the results were great’Christopher GuestI metPeter Sellersonce. The cast of Beyond the Fringe stayed with my family in New York, and I had the effrontery to ask Jonathan Miller if I could be his assistant. So I went to London and worked on his BBC film of Alice in Wonderland. We were doing some recording at Shepperton studios, and Sellers stopped by. It’s hard to believe I did this, as I was 19, but I thought it was a good idea to start doing a voice that I thought he should hear. He didn’t say anything: he just looked at me and nodded.I had seen everything he’d done, heard most of what he’d done; he was a very important person for me in the beginning of my career. I guess I fancied that I could do the same thing, like doing different voices. You see, I can do a voice, but Sellers was embedded in those characters, and that commitment made it very different. Obviously he was funny, but he did something that no one else was doing.View image in fullscreenSellers in Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyHis early films are fantastic, including the ones where he has smaller parts. Obviously the Kubrick stuff is surreal in many ways, he was given the freedom to do what he did. People just didn’t work that way and when he did films for directors that knew enough to let him do that, the results were great. Blake Edwards is not a great comedy director but he was smart enough to let Sellers take off and do what he did.This is a little embarrassing, but I remember when he had his first big heart attack in the 60s. I heard about it on the radio. I remember getting extremely upset and actually praying. I had never prayed in my life, and I haven’t since. But I thought, please, to just whoever, I prayed that he would not die.‘If he was on, it would be like a raging bushfire’Geoffrey RushI remember seeing Tom Thumb when I was seven – a studio picture, but Sellers was still a Goon. At that stage, he hadn’t decided to make a jump for film stardom. Because at the time, being a Goon was a privileged position. He had a 10-year contract, he and Spike were absurdists and were jazz guys. They put that into their comedy.When I played him [in 2004’s The Life and Death of Peter Sellers], I researched the role for the picture, and I found a copy of almost every Sellers film that existed. You can see the sense of adventure that he had with the early films: Carlton-Browne of the FO, I’m All Right Jack, The Mouse That Roared. I asked everyone if they’d met him. My publicist in the US was a young man who once had to go around to his house and shift some furniture. He said Sellers was very brusque and had no truck with some nobody from some agency. I found that quite interesting. I also met Marty Baum at [talent agency] CAA who handled a lot of Sellers’ contracts in the 70s. Marty said: a lot of people thought Sellers was complicated, a mess and whatever, but I only ever saw an erudite, very polite, very articulate, very intelligent gentleman opposite me at my desk. These are the some of the mosaic bits that we put together to make a biographical film.View image in fullscreenSellers, front centre, in I’m All Right Jack.Photograph: Studiocanal Films Ltd/AlamyWe wanted to take on the complexity of egomania, super talent, genius. Sellers would have been around so many buzzy, brilliant actors in his career, but unlike him they all didn’t know how to define themselves. People often asked me how I related to him; and I would say: I went in every day and every day in front of the mirror I played somebody else. I think there would be some psychic wear and tear from that. There was something in his personality that was very self-regarding but I would imagine he could have been absolutely hilarious to be with. If he was on, it would have been like a raging bushfire.And ultimately, when he gets to Being There (1979), that performance is as subtle as the greatest Chekhovian performance in a theatre. The thing I remember is his little round dark eyes being so childlike, his skin being so pink and papery from being hidden away from the world. I regard that as the work of a truly great performer.‘I heard The Goons and it was like a curtain had been drawn back’Michael McKeanWe had never heard of Peter Sellers in the US until a flurry in the early 60s. All of a sudden we had Tom Thumb, The Mouse That Roared, The Naked Truth, Two Way Stretch and I’m All Right Jack, which I didn’t quite understand because, at 12, I wasn’t a union member. He was just a brilliant actor and, of course, in The Mouse That Roared he played three really distinct characters. I found the whole thing thrilling.And then I had a friend who said, “Hey, have you ever heard of The Goon Show?” I think they were on WQXR and, my God, it was like a curtain had been drawn back. It was very well crafted anarchy and lunacy. And later he was so brilliant in Lolita and Dr Strangelove; there was a kind of an anarchic quality to what he was doing, but it was never out of control. It was being done by an artist, clearly, and not a clown. I was aware that a lot of the people who made me laugh or who thrilled me as actors were British; Alec Guinness, Stan Laurel and Boris Karloff. So anyway, I had my eyes wide open for good stuff, no matter who was purveying it.View image in fullscreenThe Goons … from left, Harry Secombe, Michael Bentine, Spike Milligan and Sellers.Photograph: AllstarI must have seen Dr Strangelove a dozen times and in one viewing I just concentrated on Sellers and watched the small work he was doing as Group Captain Lionel Mandrake. What I love about his work is the little stuff. I didn’t really hear about his private life until well afterwards. And still it is, to me, less interesting than his work. I remember reading Being There and then two years later seeing the film and I’m thinking: he gets this character better than the writer Jerzy Kosinski did. Sellers took this character and made his simplicity so complicated. I think that’s what’s so great about that performance. He was never a stick figure, and he was never just there for the comedy.‘I was knocked out by the sheer exuberance and the talent’Paul MertonI was slightly too young for The Goons when they were being broadcast, so the biggest impact on me was the 50th anniversaryLast Goon Show of All in 1972, which was released as an LP. I was so knocked out by the sheer exuberance and the talent, and I used to listen to the records and practice until I could do the same impressions. I just loved the sort of films Sellers was in, things like I’m All Right Jack and The Wrong Arm of the Law, which is absolutely astonishing. So I became a bit of a Peter Sellers obsessive. My favourite film of his is one that’s quite obscure, The Magic Christian, which is normally mentioned as “other disappointments”. But what other film has both Michael Aspel and Roman Polanski in it?The thing about Sellers is that he made more bad films than any other major star. You can look at his career in simplistic terms as being before the heart attack and after. He had the good fortune to be living half an hour from the planet’s best heart hospital in Los Angeles, otherwise we would have been talking about him in the same breath as someone like James Dean. Graham Stark, who knew Sellers longer than most people, said that after the heart attack, he became a completely different person.View image in fullscreenSellers, centre, with his son, Michael, left, and Ringo Starr, right, during filming of The Magic Christian in 1969.Photograph: APThe string of films he made in Britain have all got merit, but things got awkward after he went to Hollywood. In the UK, he was a big fish in a small pond, and he could bend people to his will, but he couldn’t do that in Hollywood. One of the reasons he never won an Oscar was that he just really upset people in the US. He was nominated for Dr Strangelove but he lost to Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady; what a kick in the teeth that must have been. He’d made so many enemies in Hollywood at that point. He wasn’t kissing anybody’s arse.In the past three years, I’ve been watching his films in sequence, and Being There comes as like a great beacon of joy towards the end of a miserable run of movies. It shows that he hadn’t lost his talent, he had just been in so many awful films. On Being There, he didn’t have any arguments with anybody, he admired the director, Hal Ashby, there were no tantrums. It was clearly a film that he wanted to do and that one still stands up, particularly in the age of Trump, where somebody can be misunderstood as a potential presidential candidate.‘He could be eccentric, unpredictable and maddening’Dick ClementMy generation viewed listening to The Goon Showas a holy ritual. In school we imitated all the voices. Our parents could not understand our obsession, a generational thing. I worked only once with Peter on a forgettable movie: The Prisoner of Zenda. He played two parts, but I think he got bored. Blake Edwards, who directed him in The Pink Panther said that it was vital to capture him at the right moment, rather like the “magic hour” that film crews call dawn or dusk.On location in Vienna, Ian la Frenais and I quickly discovered that he was nostalgic about the old days. The Goonsof course, but he liked to delve even further back to his time on the music hall circuit, long before fame. He thought ventriloquists, “vents” for short, were especially crazy. One called Jimmy Tattersall used several dummies in his act, and the climax involved a life-sized old lady operated by remote control, who appeared from the wings while he was singing My Old Dutch. On numerous occasions the old lady malfunctioned, took a savage left turn and ended in the orchestra pit. Peter loved that story.He could be eccentric, unpredictable and maddening, but there was never any doubt of his extraordinary talent.‘He was like a musician nailing every beat’Stephen WightPeter Sellers was a chameleon, one I learned a lot about playing his role in the original stage production of The Ladykillers. These days we associate physical transformation with huge weight loss or gain. Getting ripped for a role so our performer can be an action hero. Sellers saw physical transformation beyond the “outer” and embodied his choices with wondrous results. Some were subtle, some were extreme, but always believable and real. In The Pink Panther Strikes Again there is this wonderful taut and uptight nature to Clouseau which creates a tension and fragility that provides such a glorious platform from the comedy to spring from or break into.The juxtaposition of his arrogant, savoir faire vocal performance paired with the chaotic and clownish physicality of character is amazing. His mastery of “playing it straight” yet just on the edge of complete absurdism is nothing short of genius. The scene in which he arrives at the house to interrogate the staff is theatrical farce at its best captured on film. Sellers is like a dancer waltzing between characters and objects, like a musician nailing every beat and flowing with the rhythm of it all. The scene crackles with a sense of everyone on the verge of corpsing. He was funny as hell and made it look effortless. Sellers achieved something every actor strives for but thinks probably doesn’t exist … perfection.A Peter Sellers season runs at the BFI Southbank, London, from 2-30 August, and Two Way Stretch and Heavens Above are released on 4 August on Blu-rayExplore more on these topicsFilmPeter SellersComedy filmsRadio comedyTV comedyComedyDr StrangelovefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last month saw Lena Dunham recount her days as an American getting to grips with the realities of London inToo Much, and as production begins on yet another adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, here comes the sudsy romance My Oxford Year where the object of affection is England itself.One might assume that a university-set film directed byThe Inbetweenerscreator Iain Morris would be a ribald comedy geared toward a younger male crowd, but My Oxford Year, based on a novel by Julia Whelan, picks sentiment over sauce. It’s a frothy, throwaway fantasy about another American hoping to find herself in another country, think ofEmily in Parisbut Anna in Oxford. Anna (in-house Netflix star Sofia Carson) is a working-class New Yorker who has decided to defer her job at Goldman Sachs for a year so that she can study at Oxford, indulging her love of literature before she disappears into a life of numbers.The Naked Gun review – Liam Neeson deadpans impeccably in outrageously amusing spoof rebootRead moreHer idealised view is somewhat confirmed. There’s undeniable historical beauty surrounding her (unlike so many otherNetflixfilms, some on-location shooting helps to seduce those watching too) but in maybe the film’s only really amusing moment, we also see Anna having to reckon with the less postcard-suited side of life as her new friends show her what a perfect English evening looks like: watching an episode of Naked Attraction. Like any of the many Americans before her, from Andie MacDowell to Julia Roberts, she also finds herself falling for a foppish gent, fellow bibliophile Jamie (Bridgerton alum Corey Mylchreest).They are given a laughably convoluted meet-cute – his fancy car splashes a cartoonishly oversized puddle on her, she then sees him at the chippy and lands him in hot water with the woman he’s hiding from, she then finds out he’s her replacement teacher for the year (!) – and a romance the colour of beige follows. There are initial attempts to add some spice – he’s a privileged fuckboy who leaves conquests in his wake and she’s a salt of the earth overachiever who puts him in his place – but there’s not enough juicy conflict between them. It’s all boringly plain sailing until it suddenly isn’t and the film takes a turn from romcom into something more dramatic.More dramatic but also less interesting, as Anna finds out why Jamie has been holding back and given how the film handles the reveal like a twist, I’ll spare the details but when it comes, it’s met with a sigh of disappointment for we know exactly what story we’re being told and every single beat that will follow. It’s such well-mined territory that at this stage, to keep us even somewhat invested in such a rehash, we’d need something with far more texture or emotional rawness than this. The unsuccessful swerve then overwhelms any of the potentially knottier, more engaging elements of managing differences of class, choosing between art and commerce and grappling with a life caught between two different continents.Morris is a competent enough director but the script, from Allison Burnett and Melissa Osborne, is devoid of any real electricity, leaving it up to the leads to generate it. Carson is a better fit here than she was at playing a scrappy mess in Netflix’s similarly vanilla hitThe Life List, but she’s a little indistinctive, not quite magnetic enough to carry the weight of an every-scene lead performance. There’s more promise in Mylchreest, whose Hugh Grant cosplay is charming enough to suggest that with a sharper, wittier script he could really do something with it.As passive Netflix watches go – consumed while doing something else, destined to be forgotten about almost instantaneously – it’s better than some but as last year’s adjacent romantic weepieIt Ends With Usshowed, there’s so much more to be done in territory that often gets unfairly and snobbishly downgraded. There are big, relatable emotions to be mined but that grand sweep just never arrives in My Oxford Year, a late summer vacation that leaves us firmly on the couch.My Oxford Year is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsNetflixComedy filmsComedyDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I had this spiritual awakening’Laura BartonThe musician was living in his mother’s basement when he blagged a job in LA. Soon, his mesmeric live shows sparked a bidding frenzy. He describes how finding his wavelength on stage can fill audiences with joyFri 1 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareFour years ago, Tyler Perry’s stepfather offered him a job in the office of his dog-training company in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Perry had little else to fill his time: he was 29 and living in his mother’s basement, uncertain what he should do with the rest of his life.In 2017, he had left Berklee College of Music, where he had ostensibly studied songwriting, but largely smoked weed and skipped class. The songs he wrote then were introspective and folk-driven, in the lineage of Nick Drake and Elliott Smith – artists he had been drawn to in his senior year of high school, who had spoken to him just as depression had first set in. “I was depressed for, like, 10 years,” he says.In idle moments in the office, he would scour Craigslist, imagining a different life in New York or Nashville or LA. One day, on a whim, he applied for a recruitment job at a commercial real estate company in Los Angeles. He lied about his experience, and the fact he didn’t have a degree. “I just wrote a really good email,” he says. “And 20 minutes later they called me. I went through two interviews in a day, and then they said: ‘Can you be here in two weeks?’” Perry had never been to Los Angeles. That evening, he talked it over with his family and friends. “And my mom said: ‘What do you have to lose? A few thousand dollars? You can always come back.’ So I moved to Venice Beach, California.”In a clip of Perry that began to circulate online last autumn, the singer was filmed at Eagle Rock bar The Fableperforming Help Me Out– a song that longs for self-acceptance the way one might yearn for a lover. He moves around the stage with a sensuous majesty, a large man in triple denim, flicking his hair, courting the mic stand, his voice moving effortlessly from earth-deep to celestial. There is something of Elvis and Roy Orbison and Harry Nilsson; the kind of easy, confident performance that feels like alchemy.In person, Perry is a faintly beatific presence, sitting in a Brighton cafe in the gap between shows at the city’s Great Escape festival. He speaks gently, his conversation ranging from the suburbs of Rhode Island to the free kombucha at WeWork via countercultural philosopher Alan Watts’s thoughts on ego. What quickly becomes clear is the distance between the solid assurance of Perry’s stage self and the more tentative man sitting across the table.Before all of this – before the dog-training office and the real estate application – Perry had begun working with a counsellor and dietician named Courtney Huard. For a couple of years the pair worked on improving Perry’s sense of body positivity and mental health, and the impact was immense. “She was an incredible person and I’m really lucky I came across her,” Perry says. Around the same time, he discovered the work of self-help teacher Eckhart Tolle and his book The Power of Now, and took an Enneagram personality test. “I pinned my personality to a wall, and I got to see it for the first time,” he says. “And it shocked me out of depression. I had this kind of spiritual awakening.”The problem was that this newly awakened Perry did not fit quite so well with his catalogue of melancholy folk songs. For years, when he played live, he had hidden behind his guitar, his voice flat and whispered. “I was wanting to be ‘cool’ in that sense of ‘mystical, can’t grasp it …’” he says. “But I don’t think that’s necessarily me.”In California, he lived out of a suitcase, worked for the property company in the day, and at night played open mics across the city. Mostly he would play a couple of his own folk songs, and then a cover of Roy Orbison’s Crying. It was this last song that hit the sweet spot. “People would freak out, and it would be like it was my birthday,” he says. “Everybody in the place looking at me and clapping.”He realised that covering Orbison’s song called on the skills he had first learned doing musical theatre in high school: a supported singing voice, a sense of generosity and occasion. Perry wondered if this might be a new direction for him – one that drew on all of his musical loves, from showtunes to Fleet Foxes, via Jonathan Richman and the Who’s 1969 rock opera, Tommy. He dreamed up a character for himself, called it Tyler Ballgame – a nod to the nickname of legendary Boston Red Sox baseball player, Ted Williams, and a joking put-down to himself, a man who had spent years squandering his talent in his mother’s basement, being the very opposite of a sporting legend. He set about working out how this Tyler Ballgame might write and perform.At Berklee, Perry had attended a performance studies class taught by Livingston Taylor (brother of singer-songwriter James Taylor). The classes were held in a theatre, and on the first day, Taylor invited each of his 40 students to stand on the stage. You had to go up and hold your palms out to the audience, and shift your weight from one foot to the other in time, and look everybody in the eye.It struck Perry as brilliant.In Los Angeles, Perry remembered the class, and it struck him as an act of radical presence; something Tyler Ballgame might do. He started to try it in his live shows. “I’d reach out to the audience and look them in the eye. Like, we’re both here to do something. I’m trying to connect, and we’re going to live this experience together.” The songs came with an ease. Soulful, and sad sometimes, but also brimming with something hopeful and alive. They carried the richness and simplicity of the classics.Perry relocated to East Los Angeles, began collaborating with other neighbouring musicians, and playing live as much as he could. One day, the producer Jonathan Rado, famed for his work with Miley Cyrus and the Killers, happened to see an Instagram story of a Tyler Ballgame show and contacted him. The singer went over to Rado’s studio shortly afterwards and over the next couple of weeks, the pair recorded more than an album’s worth of material.Word of Tyler Ballgame soon spread, and by last autumn, record labels had begun making fevered bids to sign him. In the end, Perry went with the British independent Rough Trade, connecting with them over a shared love of Nick Drake and Arthur Russell. “I had a lot of options and it was really flattering and really crazy,” he says, “but I just kept coming back to Rough Trade, because of that kindred spirit of whatever music I make naturally, in my soul, they already love, because they’ve already put out all the music that I love.”Perry makes for easy company, and after an hour and a half of conversation I ask if there is anything else he might like to tell me. “I don’t know,” he says slowly, and hesitates. “Maybe I’d like to mention my counsellor, Courtney, again,” he says. “She had her life taken, really horrifically.” Huard was killed by her husband, who later killed himself. Perry learned of her death when a friend sent him a news article from his local newspaper back in Rhode Island. Perry saw the photograph and was stunned.At that precise moment he had been writing Help Me Out, a song largely inspired by Huard. “She made me realise your value is not tied to the size of your body, or how people look at you – things which had kept me from even being on stage at all.“There are so many people on the messageboards of her funeral posts and her obituary saying: ‘She set me on the course of my life.’ She was a really special person, and it just shows how precious life is. So I live for her.”It is a hot afternoon, but Perry takes to the stage at the UnBarred Brewery wearing a woollen jumper. He looks out to the crowd, gently spreads his palms, and begins to sing. It is a golden performance, the songs sounding almost as if they have always existed, and Perry entirely mesmerising.As he plays, I think of something he told me over lunch – about the freedom and fluidity of performance. “I want to be totally in the flow state, likegone,” he said. “Where nothing is canned or prepared or contrived.”Some shows, he told me, you get it, and the rest of the band get it, and the audience gets it, too. “And then it’s like real magic. It’s a celebration of the joy of performance and the joy of music.” Today as Perry and the band play, the air is filled with a kind of joy – with something like real magic in the warmth of a Sussex afternoon.Tyler Ballgame’s new single New Car is out now. He playsthe End of the Road festival, nr Blandford Forum, 30 August,andThe Lexington, London, 10 September.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockSoulfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You don’t need me to tell you why: just listen to Moin, Mark William Lewis, Quade or Still House Plants and let the feeling mingle with the deep sense of dread already entrenched in your bones. One strand of this sound’s DNA can be traced back to Dean Blunt’s warped experimentalism. Anyone attuned to the enigmatic London musician’s output is likely already aware of his long-term collaborator Joanne Robertson, a fixture on 2021’s Black Metal 2 and last year’s Backstage Raver among others. For those outside the Bluntverse, she’s likely to go overground this year as the latest tendril from its world, her new album Blurr adding folky shades to this invitingly squalid sonic scene.Joanne Robertson and Oliver Coates: Gown – videoRobertson is also a painter, and uses improvisation in both media. “I want the works to almost fail,” she once said. “I struggle with conceived notions of beauty.” The songs on Blurr hang together like spider webs, her blurred and belly-deep acoustic strums seeming to have no beginning or end. There’s a blunt weightiness to her playing that might recall the Kentucky post-rock scene of the early 90s, which anchors her searching vocals. She has a way with unearthing hypnotic pockets of melody; single Gown has something of Sinéad O’Connor’s Celtic hymns to it. Moments of sharpness evoke confrontational early Cat Power; the softer shades Jessica Pratt’s watercolour delivery. Meanwhile, the distance at which she sings brings to mind how Grouper’s music feels like following a wraithlike presence through a misty forest. Cello byOliver Coatesburnishes this uncanny sound world, one that finds unexpected openness and hope in the murk.Laura SnapesThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenEgg punk … Snooper.Snooper–WorldwideFlagbearers for the antic, lo-fi “egg punk” sound, the Nashville band return with a Devo-channelling single, frontwoman Blair Tramel contorting herself with a series of gymnastic commands.Oren Ambarchi/Johan Berthling/Andreas Werliin–ChaharThe trio’s terrific Ghosted project continues with another of their steadily rhythmic jazz quests, this one animated by a killer motif from double bassist Berthling, flexing under Werliin’s funky drums and Ambarchi’s fidgety guitar.Nourished By Time–Baby BabyThe best single yet from the underground US pop star’s upcoming new album: he rants against political apathy as new wave washes around 80s R&B flourishes and vocal samples in a psychedelic spin cycle.Enny–Cabin FevaWith the impulsive spirit of slam poetry given the discipline of hip-hop, Enny’s flow is always a pleasure. Here, over a spartan jazzy backing, she raps about preserving her self-respect amid a power-imbalanced relationship.Rema–KelebuRather than settle into masses-pleasing middle of the road pop after his mega-smash Calm Down, the Nigerian star has been admirably edgy and propulsive, and this galloping track is proper pell-mell madness.Witch Fever–Fevereaten“God put my weight under his thumb / told me I’d soon become undone …” The Manc band’s frontwoman, Amy Walpole, confronts the man upstairs with magnificent goth rock that broods then rages.Ondo Fudd–LimelightCerebral but never dull or bookish, the British dance producer Call Super resurrects his alter ego for this futurist take on Chicago house, its bassline taking on different hues as if passing through pools of coloured light.Ben Beaumont-ThomasSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify.Explore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistIndieExperimental musicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The BBC Phil were on blistering form and, late-night, the Estonian Philharmonic Choir were immaculate even if the programme felt a little blandFlora WillsonFri 1 Aug 2025 08.14 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 08.16 EDTShareEven among the staunchest classical music lovers, the phrase “star clarinettist” rings false. Compared with celebrity pianists, violinists and singers, virtuoso woodwind players don’t get much time in the spotlight. Yet Swedish clarinettistMartin Fröstisn’t just capable of technical wizardry, but is also amesmerising, full-body performer. On stage at the Royal Albert Hall, he danced, struck poses and contorted himself like a rock icon shredding a guitar solo. All while producing a tone of astonishing refinement, absolutely uniform across the instrument’s multiple registers.Fröst dominated the first half of theBBC Philharmonic Orchestra’s latest Proms outing. Copland’s Clarinet Concerto showcased his ability to blend minutely with orchestral timbres, his solo lines seamlessly interwoven with the cashmere warmth of the BBC Phil’s strings underJoshua Weilerstein. Meanwhile Fröst’s gear-change from the tenderness of its central cadenza into the sassy jazz-infused third section (here all hard-edged articulation and chippy, slightly rustic string playing) was utterly compelling.The much shorter concerto by celebrated jazz clarinettist and band leaderArtie Shawfollowed. Launching with a vibrant sting of trumpets, the BBC Phil sounded every bit like an unusually well-behaved big band with a string section for added pizzazz. Fröst clearly relished every glissando, every tricky corner of vocalise, every flight into the squeakosphere. By the time he demanded audience participation in his encore (Gounod’s Ave Maria, with Fröst playing Bach’s original prelude in C major as the audience sang), I suspect we’d have done anything he asked.Bookending the Fröst show: the short, beguiling Symphony No 2 by recently rediscovered French composerElsa Barraine– its modernist angularity offset by hints of jazz, aerated by gracefully sculpted solos from the BBC Phil’s own excellent wind players – and a taut, high-octane performance of Rachmaninov’s Symphonic Dances. Weilerstein approached the latter’s many hairpin bends like a racing driver with a title in his sights, cleaving a direct line through changes of tempo and mood, drawing out colours that morphed from the ultra-dry to utter suavity in the central waltz, before letting rip in a thrilling, wild ride of a finale – the closing triumph of an orchestra on blistering form.View image in fullscreenTõnu Kaljuste conducts theEstonian Philharmonic Chamber Choirat the Royal Albert Hall.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCThe late-night prom couldn’t have been more different. CelebratingArvo Pärt’s 90thbirthday year, theEstonian Philharmonic Chamber Choirperformed various vocal works by the Estonian composer (most in their first Proms performances), alongside a Bach motet, a couple of numbers from Rachmaninov’s All Night Vigil and two short works by Pärt’s Estonian contemporaries. Most were a cappella; Kadri Toomoja provided the minimal accompaniment demanded on organ and piano.Under Tõnu Kaljuste, the choir’s fine-grained blend sounded almost studio-produced and their intonation was remarkable, open fifths and octaves ringing brilliantly into the dome. Yet even the kaleidoscopic late-night lighting couldn’t distract from the lack of variety in this blandest selection from Pärt’s musical world. OnlyVeljo Tormis’s haunting Curse Upon Iron, accompanied by shaman drum and climaxing in a blood-curdling collective scream, offered a glimpse of something more – but also felt entirely out of place amid the wall-to-wall soothing triadic harmony.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

The original album was confounding and exhilarating in equal measure, thanks to its canny fusion of EDM rave-up synths and blown-out hip-hop beats. Alongside the rise of producers such asClams Casino, it spoke to a post-financial crisis millennial generation finding much-needed euphoria in electronic maximalism. Now, gen Z-beloved artists such as Bladee and Nettspend are reviving an even bigger, bolder version of that sound, and finding huge cult audiencesView image in fullscreenBut perhaps that’s why Electronic Dream 2 – while engrossing and atmospheric, capturing AraabMuzik’s trademark fusion of dread and debauchery – almost feels meek. Some songs, such as the smeary, blushing Til You Drop, capture the hallucinatory brilliance of the original album. Others, such as opener 3AM and the moody Half a World Away, feel more like generic beat tape cuts, in part because AraabMuzik’s sound has been so influential that it now seems a little rote.Dubbing the album a sequel to Electronic Dream may have been a mistake: the grand trap track Reach Out is imposing and scary, building to a dense cacophony, but it feels out of place on a sequel to an album with such a defined sound. It’s an understandable impulse to make a sequel: rappers have done it for years, and nostalgia-bait has become a dominant form of popular art – to the point that Madonna has been teasing Confessions Part 2. But for an innovator such as AraabMuzik, moving on seems the best path.Explore more on these topicsElectronic musicHip-hopDance musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

It was like discovering I could perform magic – pulling out one book after the other and disappearing into other worlds. I bumped into a childhood friend the other day who told me she remembers being annoyed when I came for a play date at her house and the first thing I wanted to do was see if she had any books I hadn’t read.My favourite book growing upI loved Jill Barklem’s Brambly Hedge series as a girl. The exquisite intricacy of the pictures, their evocation of a hidden world … I’m enjoying rediscovering them with my four‑year‑old.The High Hillshas a wonderful, Tolkien-esque quest element to it.The book that changed me as a teenagerAngus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snoggingby Louise Rennison. I found this and the rest of the Confessions of Georgia Nicolson series absolutely addictive, hilarious and so good in their understanding of teenage girls, their friendships, their humour. I felt like these books really “saw” me and my friends and did so compassionately, without talking down to us.The writer who changed my mindPatricia Highsmith. Before I read her books, and specificallyThe Talented Mr RipleyandThe Two Faces of January, I thought I had to like a character in order to want them to succeed. But Highsmith, in her brilliantly twisted way, puts us inside the mind of a sociopath in Ripley – we’re taken to that really uncomfortable place of rooting for a character we know we should hate. We’re desperate for him to get away with it. Or is that just me?The book that made me want to be a writerI Capture the Castleby Dodie Smith. In a way it’s a book about writing: the protagonist’s father is a (failing) writer; the protagonist-narrator keeps reminding us that we’re being told a story. I loved it for its intimacy, and for its rich evocation of a family and the main character’s coming of age.The book I rereadI could pick pretty much any Agatha Christie. I enjoyed them when I first read them (far too young!) for their puzzle element. Coming back to them as an adult, I realised how much darker some of them are:Endless Night,And Then There Were None,Crooked HouseandThe Pale Horseare all examples. Now I come back to them as a writer to try to work out how she did it.The book I discovered later in lifeEdith Wharton’sGlimpses of the Moon. I readThe House of MirthandThe Age of Innocenceyears ago, but hadn’t come across this. When I read it recently, I remembered just how much I love her writing.The book I am currently readingThe Wildernessby Angela Flournoy. It’s the story of five black women and their friendship over 20 years – including careers, marriages and motherhood – amid the political, economic and social upheaval of modern America. The characters and their friendship are so well realised; it’s utterly absorbing.Lucy Foley’s The Midnight Feast is published in paperback by HarperCollins.

The poems weave the dynamism of the Romany language with English to celebrate our intimacy with the natural world’s vast mystery and beauty: “from elm top to hedgerow … from harebell to whitethroat: / Sorí simensar sí men, / Sorí simensar sí men.” (We are all one.) This evocative braid of language is also used to consider the aching cruelty of oppression – “The gavvers kettle the Travellers on the market square. / The locals stand by gawking, piss-taking” – as well as the defiant, quicksilver power of Romany language and community. “Nouns grew spry and spring-heeled /… words which Travellers / might ride, or hide behind from hard law /… But spoken language moves / like meltwater under ice. Speech thaws into life.”View image in fullscreenVersus Versus: 100 Poems by Deaf, Disabled& Neurodivergent Poets, edited by Rachael Boast (Bloodaxe, £14.99)This anthology is a dizzying, continent-crossing explosion of verse, its topics and styles as individual as the poets; revelling in the diversity of a community that is often boxed in by ableism and prejudice. A potent theme of resisting limits courses through the book. Lateef McLeod’s poem pushes back against others’ definitions: “I am too pretty for your Ugly Laws, / too smooth to be shut in”, while Mishka Hoosen’s work celebrates the power and agency of those who think and live differently: “I am that howl / in the night ward. I am electric / without your help.” In a period in the UK when disabled people’s rights and living conditions are under threat, this collection feels timely. As Maya Abu-Hayyat suggests: “They will fall in the end, / those who say you can’t.”View image in fullscreenSo Whatby Frederick Seidel (Faber, £12.99)So What energetically decries the spectre of death and the grinding indignities of illness and age facing the 89-year-old poet, while skewering the failures of the American empire and the west more widely. In the brilliant title poem, set in Claridge’s, the speaker describes a gilded bubble of privilege in a world of atrocity: “The marble shines like syrup. / So what they whip the marble with a riding crop / To keep the lava from Vesuvius away from us / And keep Pompeii plush and posh.” Seidel remains the toweringly enigmatic, ludic and at times offensive provocateur, yet his lyric abilities with image and line never lose their power: “My breath steamed up, / A foghorn of silence inflaming the air.” So when he writes, “Poetry is meaningless. / Poetry is a disgrace on a warm spring day”, it feels that, for all his effervescent bile, we should only half believe him.In the Hollow of the Waveby Nina Mingya Powles (Nine Arches, £11.99)This luminous second collection is interested in the power of material creativity in all its forms, both within visual art and within the rich, often overlooked realms of fashion, textiles and fabric. The poet speaks of the subtle potency of clothing to shape the self and to chart memory, celebrating her Chinese-Malaysian heritage while rejecting others’ ignorance: “a gown can map a white orientalist’s dreamscape / a gown can trace the outline of a field from one’s childhood”. The book also deftly engages with the uneasy beauty of nature during a time of ecological crisis, drawing on her upbringing in Aotearoa New Zealand to create vividly unsettling images of a changing world. “It is both beautiful / and terrible / to understand the colours of a pacific coastal wildfire / wet lupine creamy aster drenched rhododendron crinkled / into pearly flame.”Transfigurations: Collected Poemsby Jay Wright (Penguin Classics, £14.99)Finally, British readers can get to grips with a profoundly original, ambitious and globally minded writer. Wright’s lyrical, experimental verse traverses world traditions and beliefs, mining the heritage of his African ancestry alongside the influence of an upbringing in the American southwest, a fulcrum of American, Spanish and Navajo cultures. The poems offer a deep engagement with spiritual knowledge and myth: “I see the God himself dance/ and turn about himself/ like the stars he moves…” They also explore the vigour of ritual, and how it might lead to personal and communal transformation: “in the order of these acts, / I take your presence upon me. /…I have been trying to create a language/ to return what you have lost /… a language to return you to yourself.” Despite their variety, these dazzling, questing poems are always seeking to discover how a collective selfhood and identity might come into being.Explore more on these topicsBooksPoetry roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

Long Chu – who won a Pulitzer prize for criticism in 2023 – believes “all novels refract the veiled subjectivity of their authors”, and to pretend otherwise is to indulge a “pernicious form of commodity fetishism”. In her reviews, books betray their authors, invariably revealing some kernel of inadequacy – be it immaturity, myopia or just terminal dullness.This approach borders on the psychoanalytical, and makes for fun reading. Long Chu diagnoses a case of “Munchausen by proxy” in Hanya Yanagihara, whose bestselling novelsA Little Life (2015) andTo Paradise (2022) are powered by “the misery principle”: “horrible things happen to people for no reason”, and the author is “a sinister kind of caretaker, poisoning her characters in order to nurse them lovingly back to health”. She notes a troubling tendency towards “infantile” idealisation of mothers and girlfriends inTao Lin’s autofiction, and finds “something deeply juvenile” about the scatological motifs inOttessa Moshfegh’s novels. Moshfegh’s medieval gore-festLapovona (2022), fails to shock, because “You cannotépater le bourgeoiswithout an actual bourgeoisie”; “the leading coprophile of American letters” is trying too hard to convince us she’s not a prude.ReviewingBret Easton Ellis’s “deeply needless” 2019 essay collection, White (“less a series of glorified, padded-out blog posts than a series of regular, normal-size blog posts”), Long Chu bemoans his descent into fogeyish paranoia, and suggests the author of American Psycho is starting to resemble his most famous creation. “At some point,” she quips, “one must ask if a man who sees Nineteen Eighty-Four all around him is really just stuck in the 80s.”A takedown ofCurtis Sittenfeld’s 2020 novel, Rodham, which imagines an alternative universe where Hillary Clinton never married Bill, is a withering indictment of hollow girl-boss feminism: this is “an unpolitical book by an unpolitical author about … an unpolitical person”; Sittenfeld’s complacency mirrors that of her protagonist, a woman whose “true talent lies in persuading college-educated people that her ambition, and by extensiontheirs, is a genuine expression of competence”. A recurring figure in these essays is the successful author with a gripe about oversensitive lefty youngsters and social media mobs. These include Ellis, Moshfegh, Maggie Nelson – whose complaints about art-world censoriousness inOn Freedomare dismissed with a huffily italicised “boring”– and Zadie Smith, whose “habit of sympathizing with the least sympathetic party in any given situation frequently drives her to the political center”. Long Chu provocatively suggests this tendency is a bit of an act, compensating for Smith’s failure to produce a touchstone work of social realism: since Smith has “never actually excelled at constructing the kind of sympathetic, all-too-human characters she advocates for”, she makes up for it with a lofty bothsidesism she thinks becoming of a serious, above-the-fray liberal humanist.Long Chu is similarly unsparing in her critique of the publishing industry’s patronising and counterproductive tendency to over-hype minority voices in order to atone for past wrongs. (“This is to respond to pigeonholing by overstating the value of being a pigeon.”) In a refreshingly clear-sighted essay on Asian American fiction, she questions whether the experiences depicted in a glut of diaspora novels have anything significant in common beyond their “diffident, aimless, frustrated” protagonists and a vague melancholy; the much-laboured theme of identity manifests as little more than “a sensation, a mild, chronic homesickness”, and “the acute experience of racial indeterminacy has diffused into something more banal”.Alongside the literary essays, Authority features dissections of TV shows and video games, and a wryly funny meditation on Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical shortcomings. (His winning strategy as a composer is “not to persuade but to overwhelm”.) There are also several personal pieces including an essay on vaginoplasty, a fictionalised account of undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (a treatment for depression), and On Liking Women, a widely shared 2018 essay about the author’s gender transition that kickstarted her writing career. Here Long Chu draws a connecting line between the gender separatist ideology of 1970s political lesbianism and today’s anti-trans activists, whom she accuses of laundering “garden-variety moral disgust”.In another era, such personal material would have sat uneasily in a volume of criticism, and it says something about our cultural moment that it doesn’t seem particularly out of place here. As Long Chu observes in the title essay, the subjectivity of the critic is an increasingly visible presence these days.Tracing the vexed debates aroundcritical authority from the 18th century to the present day, she concludes that the concept has always been “an incoherent, inconsistent, and altogetheremptything”. The job of today’s critic is not so much to impart expertise but to become a storyteller in their own right: “The critic has become awitness, one whose job is to offer up an event within her own experience in such a way that the reader, if she is so inclined, may experience it too.”This checks out. Though Long Chu’s writing style is not as overtly chummy as that of herfellow US critic Lauren Oyler, it has a similarly disarming first-person candour, offsetting stridency with spasms of self-effacing humility, and the sort of tentative qualifications more commonly encountered in spoken discourse than on the printed page. (“Perhaps I am being ungenerous”; “What I mean is that …”; “My point is that …”; “I do not mean …”; “If it sounds like I’m saying … I suppose I am.”) These tics can be a bit cloying, and the occasional adolescent turns of phrase feel jarringly regressive: Long Chu uses “boring” an awful lot; at one point, she introduces a particularly unimpressive quote with “The following is an actual sentence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Her anxiety on this score is symptomatic of a generational dilemma for a cohort of American writers who, having been raised to distrust authority – not just as a concept but perhaps especially as a register – and steeped in the highly self-conscious patter of online communities, must now work out how to be publicly clever in a non-overbearing way.In an anti-intellectual media landscape, one way to make yourself legible is to make yourself small. This is the striking thing about Long Chu’s authorial tone: she combines the expert and the naif in a single voice, which chimes with a similar dualism in her reader. These essays are essentially journeys – knotty and meandering, with moments of pithy, clarifying insight. If you can hold someone’s interest while figuring things out for yourself in real time on the page, you’re doing something right. Perhaps the true source of authority is companionable intelligence, and what we think of as sound judgment is just a function of familiarity – comfort in another person’s psychic skin.Authority: Essays on Being Right by Andrea Long Chu is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£20).

Here’s a rundown of the top nostalgia-inducing gamesKeith StuartFri 1 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 12.44 EDTShareThe seaside day trip remains an almost essential component of the school summer holidays, and although the big beachfront arcades have changed a lot over the last decade, they are still a magnet for small kids with handfuls of change, as well as adults hoping to spy an old Space Invaders cabinet in the back. As a child of the 1980s, coin-op video games were an obsession, but what really fascinated me were the older machines, the electro-mechanical oddities that hung on into the digital age. Here are 10 of the best – please add your own in the comments.Electro-mechanical driving gamesLong before the arrival of computer chips and CRT monitors, arcade driving games featured projected images of landscapes or even scrolling paintings to give the impression of hurtling along a road. The first examples arrived in the 1930s and a few later models, such as Chicago Coin’s Speedway and Sega’s Grand Prix stuck around in seaside arcades well into the 1980s. I remember playing a later example, Kasco’s astonishing 1979 arcade game The Driver, on the pier at Blackpool. It used 16mm footage of a real race to put you right in the action.Air hockeyThere was a time when the rapid-fire noise of plastic pucks rebounding around large snooker-like tables was a constant soundtrack in larger arcades. Air Hockey was invented by US company Brunswick Billiards in 1969 and it quickly caught on across the globe offering a fast-paced alternative to pool and table football. You can still find them in retro arcades, especially in traditional seaside towns such as Great Yarmouth, Blackpool and Southend.Derby gamesThese large installations feature tin horses lining up on a race track – six to eight players each sit at a cabinet in front of the course and throw balls at a target in order to move their equine racer toward the finishing line: the most accurate player wins. It seems the original version of the game, Kentucky Derby, was brought to Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the 1920s by George Valentine Tonner, an Irish-American soldier, jockey and amusement park concessionaire who also patented an early version of dodgems. Later examples swap horses for donkeys or camels, while a smaller variant, The Derby by Whittaker Bros, invited multiple players to bet on the outcome of automated horse races for a modest payback.Egg vending machinesToy vending machines followed gumball machines into American stores, cafes and station platforms in the 1930s, but it was in 1965 that the firstgachaponmachine was installed in a shop in Tokyo by entrepreneur Ryuzo Shigeta. These dispensed their wares in cute little plastic capsules, and the idea caught on. More commonly known as egg machines in the UK, most 1980s seaside arcades would have a couple outside the entrance, the most famous examples beingGlendale’s Oranges and Lemonsand Lucky Eggs machines, the later of which would dispense your prize from a rotating, clucking hen – which made it that much more special.Basketball hoopsYou’d get rows of these large machines, often at the back of the arcade, giving players a number of chances to lob a basketball through a hoop, usually within a caged play area so you didn’t accidentally launch the ball across the room. Classics such as Hoop Shot, Triple Jam and Full Court Fever added features including moving hoops and connected play so you could compete against pals on nearby machines. This was always where the rowdy teens hung out.Fortune telling machinesView image in fullscreen‘I wanna be big’ … a Zoltar fortune-telling arcade machine in Coney Island, New York.Photograph: Edward Westmacott/AlamyOriginating in the late 19th century these arcade and boardwalk amusements usually feature animated automatons, often stereotypical representations of Gypsies, witches or ancient Middle Eastern royalty. Put in a coin and the mystic character gestures, breathes and speaks your fortune (or deposits a card with your fortune written on it), accompanied by special effects such as a glowing crystal ball. Notable examples include Madame Zita, the creepy 1977 innovationMorgana, whose face is a video projection on to a featureless foam head, andZoltar, which inspired the 1988 movie Big. Other automaton machines feature dancing puppets and absolutely terrifying laughing clowns.Punch ballBeloved of young men keen toprove their masculinity, these have been around since at least 190o when the Chicago-based Mills Novelty Co released its Punching Bag model, complete with ornate oak stand. Modern versions have digital displays featuring accurate strength read-outs, but you’re still just hitting a ball as hard as you can. Other strength testing machines include the Mr Muscle machine from Italian manufacturer Zamperla, which challenged you to arm wrestle with an intimidating plastic man.Crane grabberView image in fullscreen‘One wants a teddy’ … The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge play a crane grabber game at Island Leisure Amusement Arcade, Barry IslandPhotograph: Ben Birchall/PAAlso known as claw machines, these remain a staple arcade experience. You slot in a coin and use the joystick to direct an ineffectual grabber towards your desired toy. Usually, it makes a pathetic attempt before dropping the item millimetres away from the delivery chute (mostly because the clawscan be setto only grip at full strength for a minority of attempts). The first commercial example isthought to bethe Erie Digger manufactured in the US through the 1920s but since then well-known arcade manufacturers such as Sega and Bally have created their own examples, the former revolutionising the market in the 1980s with its UFO Catcher machines offering larger prizes and a brighter kawaii look. They remain irresistible.Light gun shooting galleriesLight gun shooting galleries were in every arcade in the 70s and 80s, but my favourite examples were the large installations featuring lifesize scenes to shoot at, often with a wild west, pirate or gangster theme. The one I most remember playing – I think in Blackpool’s Coral Island arcade – was calledHillybilly Moonshineand it had several mannequins dressed in overalls as well as a big copper distiller and various barrels and critters. If you hit the hillbillies they fired water pistols at you. You can still find these dotted about in surviving coin-op houses and they’re really worth a go.Coin pusherView image in fullscreenRecouping costs … a Penny Falls machine.Photograph: Alastair Balderstone/AlamyInvented by Ramsgate-based manufacturing firm Cromptons in 1966 (though there were earlier variants), coin push games are the kings of the seaside arcade, dominating the floor space and enticing players with their piles of sparkling treasure surely ready to fall at any second. The original was called Penny Falls, but there are hundreds of variations now, including virtual coin pushers, which move the action on to a screen with lots of special effects. Oh, the hours I spent during summer holidays wandering the arcades of Blackpool and Morecambe, a plastic cup of 2p coins in my hand, scrutinising these seductive machines. “Penny pushers are absolutely pivotal to the success of the British amusement arcade,” says lecturer and historian Alan Meades, author of Arcade Britannia: A Social History of the British Amusement Arcade. “Alongside the fruit machine they are where the arcades made their money – penny pushers could last for decades – retooled with currency changes – and recouped their costs time and again.”Explore more on these topicsGamesBeach holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Those who play games on the toilet, and those who pretend they don’t. I am a proud member of the former category. I realise this may not be the most “Guardian” of Guardian article openings, but we all use the toilet and we all play games; I am merely providing a Venn diagram.We used to read books in there. I even had a small bookcase in mine, and am old enough to remember when a workplace was not considered civilised unless there was a copy of that day’s newspaper in every cubicle so that hard working staff could catch up with global goings on during their five minutes of down-the-pan time.Once we felt confident to admit we were all reading in there, the toilet book became a publishing phenomenon. Whether this was implicit in the case of, say, QI: The Book of General Ignorance or explicit in the case of Uncle John’s Bathroom Reader. Both provided snack-sized nuggets of erudite entertainment that made bathroom visits doubly productive.Phones changed all that. Soon grown men were whipping out their Nokia and playing with a different kind of Snake. Floppy newspapers made way for Flappy Birds.My own toilet gaming predated phones, beginning with Nintendo Game & Watch. A couple of my school chums were lucky enough to own them, and I’ve yet to see a greater example of true friendship than someone allowing you to take their Oil Panic handheld into the privy. Before that I used to make up a game where I would see how fast I could start and then stop the stopwatch on my Casio digital watch. My record was 0.07 seconds. But I was a younger man then.Ironically, dedicated handheld gaming machines never worked in there for me. The Game Boy was too large and fancy and there was no point entering with a Game Gear or Atari Lynx because the batteries wouldn’t cover a single visit.The Game Boy Advance SP was a quantum leap in toilet gaming because it was small and discreet with 10 hours of battery life. But that’s where I learned the pitfalls of toilet gaming. It needed to be an undemanding game you could play in bite-sized chunks. Advance Wars nearly killed me. The later missions had me sitting there so long that when I tried to get off the seat my legs would be asleep and I’d topple over like a rotten tree in a forest. Thankfully, no one else was in there to hear, so I didn’t make a sound.In the modern world, the toilet is conducive to gaming because there are no distractions. No one is bothering you in there. And, equally importantly, it is guilt free. Parenting begets gamer’s guilt. You always feel you should be doing something more “worthwhile”. Helping the kids with school stuff or working harder to ringfence their future from the slings and arrows of an outrageously fragile world. The toilet becomes a mini oasis of isolated tranquility and undisturbed gaming where you answer the call of nature rather than the yell of parenthood.View image in fullscreenZenith … Lego Hill Climb Adventures.Photograph: FingersoftMy toilet gaming has increased the older my children get. I refuse to fix our noisy bathroom fan because it’s the only thing that drowns their voices out. In recent times Alto’s Adventure, Pocket Run Pool, Prune, NFL RB25,Pocket Card JockeyandMarvel Snaphave proved perfect bathroom companions that you can skim the fun from without sitting there so long that your family reports you missing. The absolute zenith of my toilet gaming is Lego Hill Climb Adventures, which I use when I pop into the powder room to cope with workplace stress. (As much as I loveBalatroyou don’t have time to win a game without getting pins and needles, but you do have just enough time to lose one.)Gaming is so immersive it helps you forget the outside and what you are in there to do. That’s why we started reading in the first place: as a bowel-loosening distraction from the business at hand. I started gaming as a child, with our ZX Spectrum set up in a cupboard. I could shut the door and escape from parents who constantly and loudly fought into an alternate world where problems could be solved. That’s why games appealed to me in the first place. I am glad they can still do the same nearly half a century later in the smallest, safest room of all.Explore more on these topicsGamesHandheldMobile gamescommentShareReuse this content"

The story of the Baptist’s martyrdom – also painted by Caravaggio and dramatised by Oscar Wilde with illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley – has it that Salome’s mother Herodias got her to demand John’s head in return for dancing before her stepfather Herod. Rubens gives it a cannibalistic twist: he dwells on the banquet’s food and drink and has the head brought up to Herod as an exotic dish. Herodias sticks her fork in its tongue. Yummy!

Safe to say the definition of mental illness was not the same as it is today. Inmates could end up being committed for anything from promiscuity to poverty.It was here thatDr Jean-Martin Charcotdeveloped his theory of hysteria, a word whose etymology goes back to the Greek word for uterus. Breaking with a long tradition of doctors who attributed erratic behaviour in women to a wandering womb, Charcot treated hysteria as a neurological disorder. He insisted men could be susceptible too.In that and other areas, Charcot was a medical pioneer, even if his use of hypnosis, photography and showmanship strike us as eccentric today. We no longer ask patients to perform their illness for a curious audience nor do we recognise his four stages of hysteria.That conditions in Victorian asylums were less than ideal and that women have had a raw deal due to the slow evolution of psychiatry hardly needs saying. What makes Helena McBurney’s script so riveting is the way it blends misogyny and mental illness into fluid theatrical poetry, blurring the line between medic and patient in a play that is half lecture, half nightmare.Dressed in silky off-white trousers and a top buttoned up the back like a designer straitjacket, actor Charlotte McBurney gives a high-precision performance that crackles with vulnerability, confusion and intelligence. Haunted by voices coming at her from all directions in Bella Kear’s swirling sound design, she morphs from sober narrator to pompous doctor to psychotic Salpêtrière resident in a troubling collage.In Christina Deinsberger’s production for Fish in a Dress, the actor is crisp, physical and speedy as she draws us from lucidity to feverishness and makes connections to the treatment of women across the centuries.At the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalMental healthreviewsShareReuse this content"

Having been rounded up, each ringleader was tied to the mouth of a cannon. Before the eyes of the public, the weapon was fired.To emphasise the point, a cannon sits on stage in Kanpur: 1857 – surely the largest prop at the fringe – positioned threateningly behind Niall Moorjani, who plays a storyteller facing his final hour, trying to come up with a narrative that makes sense of his awful predicament. How did a boy who grew up peacefully on the banks of the Ganges, who was captivated by poetry and the beauty of the spoken word, end up in this situation?Didn’t his fellow rebel forces have the good grace to free their captured enemies and return their weapons? He sees himself as a good man caught up in the harsh tide of history.Moorjani,a storyteller, is a still and compelling narrator, whose performance is enhanced by the live tabla playing of Sodhi (Hardeep Deerhe), sitting meditatively by his side. They are joined by Jonathan Oldfield as the British army executioner, whose membership of a Scottish regiment (posh southern accent notwithstanding) serves as a reminder that Scotland was as gung-ho a part of the British empire as England.The soldier is intrigued by his captive’s tale, but on too much of a power kick to be empathic. The character’s presence in and out of the audience gives the performance a lively dynamic, although not quite enough to create a full-fledged play. The production sits in limbo between storytelling and drama, even as it remains a shameful and important reminder of a neglected period of British history.At the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsThis article was amended on 1 August 2025 to correct some personal information.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Thank you to all of his fans and friends – those who cherished his music. And a big thank you for all of the memories. His legacy will live on through his music and all of his fans.”The cause of death is unknown but a Januarypostfrom his family stated that he was “in the hospital facing a medical hurdle”.According to his son Arturo, his last words were “Ya estoy cansado”, which translates to “I’m tired.”Jiménez won six Grammy awards in his career, including for country instrumental performance and tejano music performance, and a lifetime achievement award in 2015. “This one, the lifetime achievement, is top of the line,” hesaidat the time. “You can’t go higher than that one.”His sound was instrumental in definingtejano and conjunto music. The Guardian’s Piper LeMoine wrote that “the soundtrack of the American south-west would be incomplete” without these two genres.“The way I learned to play the accordion was on the wild and happy side, much like Cajun and zydeco music,” he once said in aninterview. “One of my early idols was Clifton Chenier. The way he played, it was like the accordion was yelling at you: hey, take this. I like to make my accordion yell and scream and make it happy.”After performing in San Antonio in the 1960s, Jiménez went to New York City and worked with artists including Bob Dylan, Carlos Santana, Willie Nelson and the Rolling Stones.His first solo album was released in 1972 and he would go on to record more than 25 in his career.A tribute was paid by Cesar Rosas, a member of Los Lobos who worked with Jiménez on the song Don’t Worry Baby.“Not only was Flaco my musical mentor, but he was also a dear friend to all of us Los Lobos,” Rosas said to theSan Antonio Express-News. “He was such a musical influence on me that [he] made me run out and buy a bajo sexto and start using it in my band. He will forever be in my heart. What a tremendous loss.”Explore more on these topicsMusicTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite being one of Bollywood’s most bankable superstars for more than three decades, he realised that only tiny numbers of Indians were watching him on the big screen.Indian cinema is widely adored and has an outsized influence on society but just 2-3% of its 1.4 billion people go to the cinema.One longstanding problem is access, in particular in rural areas. Khan, who has starred in, directed and produced celebrated films including Lagaan, 3 Idiots and Taare Zameen Par, spent years trying to develop a plan to build thousands of low-cost cinemas in India’s rural hinterland where films could be beamed in via satellite. However, the initiative was stymied by relentless bureaucracy.Cost, too, has become a big obstacle. In the past, going to the cinema was a vibrant, often rowdy communal affair, where families would pack out single-screen cinemas amid cheering, dancing and whistling, with tickets costing just a few rupees. But as multiplexes have come to dominate in India, it has become a luxury experience. Tickets now regularly cost upwards of 500 rupees (£4.30) – unaffordable to most families in India.View image in fullscreenAamir Khan and Gracy Singh in Lagaan (Once Upon a Time in India), 2001.Photograph: AJ Pics/Alamy“When my first film came out the cinema tickets were 10 rupees and whole families from all classes could afford to come [and] pack out cinema halls,” said Khan, 60. “But the reality is that theatres are no longer a mass medium, it’s become an upper-class medium. And as film-makers, we haven’t done enough to change that and reach that other 97% of the population.”Instead, he said people had found other ways to watch films: either waiting for them to come on to satellite television or watching grainy pirated versions on their phones.This week, however, Khan presented what he promised would be the solution – or what he described as the “future for Indian cinema”. After a traditional cinematic run, his latest release, Sitaare Zameen Par (Stars on Earth), will be made available for audiences exclusively onYouTubefor just 100 rupees, the equivalent of less than £1. Other films in his back catalogue and future releases will follow.His choice of YouTube, known more as a place to watch trailers than full movies, was deliberate. Of all entertainment platforms, YouTube’s reach in India – with 491 million users – far outstretches other traditional streaming services such asNetflix, which has about 12 million subscribers in India. It was, said Khan, “an absolute no-brainer when you consider the reach it has”.“Internet penetration in India is now huge so you don’t need physical theatres to reach an audience any more,” Khan said. “I believe this is the model that will reach out to the maximum number of people and also serve the film industry’s creative community. Of course, the first place for our films should always be theatres. But then they should be available to the bulk of the country at an affordable price.”Khan said he would always prefer people to watch his films on the big screen but the reality was that theatres were not catering to the audience he wanted to reach.He said: “The idea with this is that 100 rupees would be paid by a whole family to watch the film together, maybe with their neighbours as well, so the cost per head would be very low.”View image in fullscreenAamir Khan with Gunjan Soni, the managing director of YouTube India.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPAKhan’s decision to offer an alternative is also a response to the detrimental role he believes streaming has played in the crisis being faced by Indian cinema.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the past decade, since right-wing Hindu nationalist politics have come to dominate India, film-makers have accused India’s film censors of being draconian and blocking anything politically contentious.Bollywood’s biggest male stars – Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, often referred to as the “trinity of Khans” – are all Muslim and have been targeted by nationalists, who have mobilised hate campaigns and boycotts of their films and accused them of being “anti-India”. Khan continues to be haunted by comments he made a decade ago, stating that he felt unsafe amid “rising intolerance”, which prompted protests.Khan acknowledged that many in the industry felt their creative instincts were being curbed by people in positions of strength who know very little about mass communication. “They feel they don’t have the freedom to say things the way they want to and how they want to,” he said.But Khan said censorship and other pressures faced by Indian cinema were nothing new and dated back to the 1940s. “Every society has a certain percentage of people who are negative in their outlook and that is not going to disappear.”Despite entertaining thoughts of retirement – as well as a brief period during the pandemic when he “secretly retired for six months” – Khan said he remained excited by the possibilities of cinema in India. “I’m really hopeful this new model will work,” he said. “If it doesn’t, we’re all in trouble.”Explore more on these topicsBollywoodIndiaFilm industrySouth and central AsiaYouTubeNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.August is a tricky time to buy clothes. Shops are winding down their summer sales and introducing new season collections, but there’s still at least another month of good weather. Yet you don’t want to double down on summery separatestoomuch, because autumn/winter is just around the corner.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That’s why it’s the best time to start buying transitional pieces – those you can wear whether the temperature’s in the 30s or the low teens. Think about clothes that lend themselves to layering, such as an Oxford shirt. You could wear it over a tank top with trousers for a nice dinner fit on holiday, but it works just as well under a blazer when the weather changes. Similarly, a lightweight knit could be worn around your shoulders, over a T-shirt or even across your fronta la Nicholas Hoult.Try to buy natural fibres where you can, too. Anything made using human-made textiles (polyester, nylon, rayon etc) tends to be less breathable, so it’s a one-way ticket to sweat patches. Stick to cotton, linen, merino wool or even cashmere, which regulate your temperature more effectively whether you’re too hot or too cold.Or, to save you some time and effort, here’s my top pick of the best pieces to see you through this season and beyond. You, and your future wardrobe, can thank me later.A striped Oxford shirtto wear year-roundView image in fullscreenArket relaxed poplin shirt£75 at Arket£63.75 at H&MI wear striped Oxford shirts more than anything else in my wardrobe – and Scandi high-street retailer Arket always has a good selection. Dress them up with trousers or down with jeans; wear them withshort shortsin summer; or with a blazer in winter – you can even wear them to work. You can make them appropriate for pretty much any situation.Stripes are trending for spring/summer 2026, too – just look at Dior, Saint Laurent, Wales Bonner and Emporio Armani – so even though it’s a timeless buy, it will also make you look like a menswear pro right now.A cap for all seasonsView image in fullscreenGantcotton twill cap£25.60 at Cho£40 at GantBaseball caps have obvious benefits in summer, but they’re also useful when the sun’s not shining. They’re a stylish alternative to woollen hats, still delivering warmth and keeping the rain out of your eyes if you get caught in a shower.There’s loads to choose from, but I like six-panel constructions, which feel a little less structured than those with five. This Gant cap adds understated embroidery and a hidden pouch for the adjustable strap, which is a plus.The perfect versatile smart shoeView image in fullscreenGH Basspennyloafers£99 at Stuarts£160 at FarfetchWhenever you’re faced with a smart-casual dress code, you’ll want a pair of loafers to hand. No matter what time of year, they have the ability to make anything look elevated, whether you pair them with a T-shirt and jeans, a shirt and shorts, or a hoodie and work pants.My favourite silhouette is penny loafers – GH Bass is credited with popularising with this particular style (the Weejuns), which the brand first released in 1936. If you want something dressier, you could tryhorsebit loafersinstead.A great pair of jeansView image in fullscreenLevi’s 501 jeans£80 at John Lewis£90 at Levi’sA strong pair of jeans is a great investment. You can wear them with anything bar formal wear, and they last for areallylong time – so it’s one of the best categories to buy secondhand, too (checkBeyond Retro,RokitandVinted).Levi’s always has an amazing selection to choose from, but you can’t beat the 501, the brand’s OG straight leg silhouette. It’s been popular for more than 150 years (since 1873, to be exact), so chances are it’s not going out of style any time soon.The cashmere sweatshirt that’s not just for winterView image in fullscreenRise & Fall cashmere sweatshirt£220 at Rise & FallThis might sound crazy, but a lightweight cashmere knit can be just as good in summer as winter. It’s lightweight. It’s comfy. And it helps regulate your temperature because it’s breathable.This Rise & Fall sweatshirt lends itself to the transitional season with a loose, oversized fit, a relaxed dropped shoulder and a rolled hem that means it’s nice and airy. And if you get too warm, you can just throw it over your shoulders.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Eme Studios has been trending recently, worn by everyone from Josh O’Connor to Jaden Smith and Evan Mock. This design has a boxy fit that’s just as perfect for showing off short shorts as classic work pants and jeans.The classic tracksuit bottomsView image in fullscreenAdicolor Classics Firebird tracksuit bottomsFrom £30 at Asos£38.50 at AdidasMost guys have a pair of sports shorts to wear around the house. If you’d like something similar that you couldalsowear for a flight or even to pop to the shops, tracksuit bottoms are the answer– and they’re having a moment, with sporty separates big on the spring/summer 2025 runways at Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Moschino. The best on the market? Adidas’s Firebird has a comfy straight leg and retro-inspired details. It comes in a rainbow of colours, so you’re covered regardless of your preference.Trousers for all weathersView image in fullscreenUniqlo pleated wide trousers£39.90 at UniqloThere are a few occasions when shorts just won’t do, even in the heat. But many trousers don’t lend themselves to hot climates. Enter Uniqlo’s pleated wide trousers. They’re lightweight. They’re loose. They’re flowy. And, because they’re tailored, they also look smart. And they’ll look great with a cosy jumper when winter comes.Classic wireframe sunglassesView image in fullscreenJimmy Fairly the Ben sunglasses£135 at Jimmy FairlyBuying high-street sunglasses can be tricky towards the end of the season, but there are a few brands that offer quality designs at a great price. Jimmy Fairly is one of my favourites. Designs like these wire frames feel classic, so they’re a safe bet all year round – unlike statement colours and XL designs, which may feel particularly summer-coded.Swap citrus notes for woody accordsView image in fullscreen&Horace eau de parfum, 50ml£62 at HoraceWith fewer balmy nights on the horizon, you may want to change your lightweight spritz to one more woody or aromatic – but that doesn’t go as heavy as oud or leather. &Horace has the perfect balance. Often compared toLe Labo’s Santal 33, it combines a base of sandalwood with bergamot, white pepper and tobacco for a fragrance that’s at once crisp and warm.Peter Bevan is a stylist and fashion journalist covering menswear, womenswear and beauty.

Albariño is its natural companionThis cool, textured grape that’s usually grown by the coast is an easy pairing with any catch of the day, and will also happily accompany any summer menuHannah CrosbieFri 1 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s World Albariño Day today – 1 August. I’ve got a soft spot for arbitrary wine holidays, so I’m marking the occasion by using it as an excuse to spend the weekend guzzling one of my favourite white wines. I’ve given you notice (sort of), so off you go to your nearest independent or supermarket to pick up something racy and saline.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It used to be thought that the albariño grape was brought to Spain by the French monks of Cluny, but that has since been disproved, with no parentage between albariño and burgundian varieties. Rather, the grape is now believed to be an ancient variety that’s native to the Iberian coast, with a naturally thick skin providing resistance to the diseases a humid climate can give rise to (alvarinho is the grape’s name in northern Portugal, where it’s essential in the production of easy-to-love vinho verde).The wines it produces are direct and acidic, with an unmistakable mineral salinity. It’s often unoaked, but some producers are having fun by experimenting with barrel-ageing their albariños to give them extra weight and depth. Such wines are often drunk a little later, but most albariño is designed to be drunk within a couple of years of its release.But why August for World Albariño Day? Why not deepest, darkest winter or the yawning, stretching spring? My guess is that it’s because the stuff goes down like a homesick mole and works with pretty much anything you’d want to eat when it’s hot and sticky outside. Which makes sense when you think of Galician cooking, or indeed other coastal regions that grow albariño, where the cuisine is defined by seafood. What grows together goes together, and all that.A friend of a friend in Galicia says albariño hasaguja, unlike most other Spanish wines. The word translates as “needle”, and relates to the verve of top, high-acid albariño, whose unique electricity is best paired with very simple seafood, preferably cooked in salt water, as they do in Galicia.“It’s my go-to picnic wine,” says Jeff Koren, director of wine atThe Chancery Rosewood in Mayfair, who loves albariño so much that he once worked a vintage at the vauntedBodegas Albamar. “I want to drink it with crudites, Greek salad, prosciutto or jamón with melon, while I’d pair the cool, textured, barrel-aged stuff with anything I’m eating in the summer heat.”The grape’s harmonious relationship with coastal regions has brought it to various corners of the world where the vineyards benefit from cooling maritime climates. Areas of New Zealand, California and South America are all producing their own interpretations of this wine, so there are plenty of options for your albariño day celebrations. Apologies for the rather late notice, it will almost definitely happen again.Four albariños to tickle the tastebudsM&S Albariño Uruguay£10 Ocado, 12%.

(Use a good-quality store-bought jam if making your own is a step too far.) All the components can be made ahead of time, ready to be assembled, but be aware that the finished cake needs to be refrigerated for at least three hours, and preferably overnight.Black forest crepe cakeYou can make the jam up to five days in advance. Store, covered, in the fridge.Prep10 minChill4 hr+Cook1 hr 30 minServes8-10For the sour cherry jam300g drained sour cherries(from a jar or frozen)1 tbsp lemon juice150g jam sugar(with pectin)1tbspkirsch(optional)For the white chocolate cream100g white chocolate, roughly chopped40g unsalted butter, soft but not oily140g cream cheese1tbspkirsch, or ¼ tsp almond extract (optional but highly recommended)140ml cold double creamFor the crepes125g plain flour2 tbsp (16g) unsweetened cocoa powder, plus extra for dusting1 tbsp icing sugar¼ tsp fine sea salt2 large eggs330ml milk1 tbsp melted unsalted butter, plus extra for cooking the crepes1 tsp vanilla extractPut all the jam ingredients except the kirsch in a medium saucepan, place on a low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium, bring to a boil, then simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, until thick and syrupy – the timing will depend on how wide the pan is. Stir in the kirsch, if using, then transfer the jam to a small bowl and leave to cool.To make the white chocolate cream, put the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a small pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted, then leave to cool to tepid.In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter with the paddle attachment on medium-high until smooth. Beat in the cream cheese, then pour in the melted chocolate and kirsch, if using, and mix until smooth. Add the cream, beat to soft peaks, then cover and chill for at least an hour (and up to two days).To make the crepes, sift the flour, cocoa, icing sugar and salt into a medium bowl. Make a well in the centre, crack in the eggs and whisk to break them up. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to form a smooth batter, then beat in the melted butter and vanilla.(Alternatively, put everything in a blender or food processor and blitz smooth.You’ll need one large crepe (at least 23cm) and 10 smaller ones (about 20cm). When ready to cook, set a large (25cm), nonstick crepe or frying pan on a medium heat. Add a little butter (about a quarter-teaspoon) and swirl it around with a piece of kitchen paper. Pour in 80ml of the batter and swirl to get a thin, even layer. Cook for about a minute, then flip and cook the other side until lightly golden. Transfer to a plate.Swap to a smaller (20cm) nonstick crepe or frying pan and heat well. Repeat the above process to make 10 smaller crepes, adding a swipe of butter and using a scant 60ml batter each time. Stack and cover the crepes as you go.To assemble, lay two long pieces of clingfilm perpendicular to each other on a worktop to form a large cross. Put the large crepe in the centre and spread a thin, even layer of white chocolate cream (about 80g) over the surface. Place a smaller crepe in the centre and spread with about 50g of cherry jam. Continue layering, alternating between 50g cream and 50g jam, finishing with a plain crepe on top.Once all the crepes are stacked, gently gather the edges of clingfilm up and over the cake, pulling firmly so the larger crepe curves up around the edges of the stack of small crepes. Twist the clingfilm tightly in the centre and secure with a clip, then transfer clip side up to a large pasta bowl or similar container to help hold its curved shape. Refrigerate for at least three hours, or overnight.To serve, unwrap and remove the clingfilm, invert the cake on to a serving plate so the seam is underneath and dust generously with cocoa powder.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodBakingFruitDessertChocolatePancakesrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When it comes to glamorous fans, Emilio Pucci was the envy of other fashion designers. During the 1950s and 60s, the “prince of prints” – as the designer became known – dressed Elizabeth Taylor, Jackie Kennedy and Sophia Loren. Marilyn Monroe was even buried in the brand. And now, more than 30 years after his death, Pucci’s trademark vibrant swirly prints are enjoying another fashion moment.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The return of Pucci has been bubbling up through content creators on TikTok, and the brand has the endorsement of Gen Z favourite Hailey Bieber. But it was confirmed this week when Lyst, the fashion data experts,revealedthat searches for the brand had increased 96% in the second quarter of the year. Two of the classic prints – the pink Marmo from 1968 and the Orchidee from 1966 – were particularly popular, on minidresses and handkerchief tops.View image in fullscreenA model presents a creation as part of Emilio Pucci spring/summer 2005 women’s collection in Milan.Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/ReutersWhile not everyone can afford the prices of new Pucci – aOrchidee minidress is £645– Depop also report a rise in secondhand: searches are up 381% since January on the resale app. And there are Pucci-like prints on fast fashion sites such as Shein and Asos for as little as £14.51.Pucci’s popularity is about more than irresistible bright prints. It signposts a change in mood. Katy Lubin, the vice-president of brand and communications at Lyst, says: “It’s been years of this quite serious, quite luxury, minimal, intellectual fashion, or just quite plain and neutral-y fashion. It’s exciting to see something that feels colourful and fun and fresh – especially during summertime.”The season is another factor. On social media, videos showing Pucci often feature the hashtag #puccigirl or #puccisummer – one Vogue writer reported in April:“The Pucci woman is taking over my summer moodboard”. The trend is an offshoot of a wider aesthetic called“Euro summer”, which highlights the props that represent a starter pack of summer on the continent – from tomatoes and pasta, to white walls and blue sea. It seems Italian brands with print and colour are part of this, too. Lubin says there is also renewed interest in Missoni, Versace and Roberto Cavalli, but describes Pucci as “the hero brand”.This status is down to Pucci’s history – and its association with jet-set holidays. The label was founded by Pucci, a marchese who grew up in a palace in Florence. He launched his brand in the 1940s and opened a boutique in Capri in 1950. In the 50s and 60s, Taylor and others began wearing the designs on holiday. Now, says a Depop spokesperson, “the brand’s psychedelic prints [are] synonymous with Italian glamour and vintage style”.Camille Miceli has been the creative director of Pucci since 2021, and she has doubled down on this heritage.Speaking not long after her appointment, she said: “Pucci isn’t a conceptual brand, it’s a lifestyle brand, so its message has to be direct.” This message has been clearly signposted by the staging of the brand’s shows – themost recenttook place in Portofino, another upscale Italian holiday destination. It’s a move that helps the brand appeal both to the wealthy women that go to such locations, and those who aspire to do so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Depop’s spokesperson argues this points to the return of “a more maximalist style of dressing – [it’s] less brash than the logomania of the 2010s but still gives instant ‘if you know, you know’ cues to other fashion insiders”. Lubin, meanwhile, describes the prints as “the equivalent to the logo to be seen in this summer”.As a brand so associated with the summer season, what are the chances that these prints will still be seen as autumn arrives? If minidresses and handkerchief tops might make an exit, Lubin says silk scarves will remain: “That could be one way we will see Pucci beyond the beach.”Explore more on these topicsFashionItalyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

On TikTok, users gush about their clothes in outfit-of-the-day posts or shopping hauls. This week, however, the brand found itself facing backlash over its new campaign, starring the 27-year-old White Lotus and Euphoria actor Sydney Sweeney, in which critics are alleging American Eagle uses the language ofeugenicsto try to sell denim.The campaign depicts Sweeney in a denim shirt and baggy jeans provocatively posing as a male voice says: “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.” In one now-viral clip,Sweeney is filmed pasting a campaign poster on to a billboard. The poster’s text reads “Sydney Sweeney has greatgenesjeans”. In another video that has since been removed from American Eagle’s social media channels, Sweeney, who has blond hair and blue eyes, says: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality, and even eye colour. My jeans are blue.”American Eagle faces backlash over ‘Sydney Sweeney has great jeans’ adRead moreCritics were quick to point out the implications of the advert’s wordplay. In one video that has had more than 3m views,a TikTok usercompared it to “fascist propaganda,” adding: “a blonde haired, blue-eyed white woman is talking about her good genes, like, that is Nazi propaganda”. On the brand’s own channels, users are battling it out in the comments section. “It’s giving ‘Subtle 1930’s Germany’,” reads one. Another person posted: “The woke crowd needs to leave the room.” Even the US senator Ted Cruz has weighed in. Reposting a news story on X,he commented: “Wow. Now the crazy Left has come out against beautiful women. I’m sure that will poll well ...”According to Sophie Gilbert, a staff writer at the Atlantic and author of the bookGirl on Girlwhich explores how pop culture is shaped by misogyny: “The slogan ‘Sydney Sweeney has good jeans’ obviously winks at the obsession with eugenics that’s so prevalent among the modern right.” Dr Sarah Cefai, a senior lecturer in gender and cultural studies at Goldsmiths, University of London, agrees. “Honestly, what were they thinking, that a white supremacist fantasy has permission to be aired so conspicuously?”Aria Halliday, an associate professor in gender and women’s studies, African American and Africana studies and author ofBuy Black: How Black Women Transformed US Pop Culture, isn’t surprised by the ad. In recent years, she says, “we have seen an influx of media reasserting the beauty of thin, white, blond, and blue-eyed people,” with many brands “invested in re-presenting the wholesomeness and sanctity of conservative white values.”Critics have also zeroed in on the campaign’s focus on Sweeney’s body.In one clipthe camera zooms in on the actor’s breasts – lingering in a way that Gilbert sees as “leering and unapologetic” – as Sweeney says: “My body’s composition is determined by my jeans.” The camera then cuts back to Sweeney’s face as she shouts: “Hey, eyes up here!” For Cefai, “its sexualisation of the viewer via its voyeurism exposes western sexism as a racialised fantasy of whiteness”. American Eagle were approached for comment by the Guardian but did not respond.View image in fullscreenYouth sells … Brooke Shields in 1980, aged 15, in an ad for Calvin Klein.Photograph: Calvin KleinFashion campaigns are notorious for purposefully sparking controversy, but the denim genre is a particularly seedy seam. In a 1980s Calvin Klein campaign, a 15-year-old Brooke Shields mused: “You know what gets between me and my Calvin’s? Nothing.” In 1995, another Calvin Klein ad featured models including Kate Moss being filmed in a basement as they undid the top button of their jeans and were asked: “Are you nervous?” It wascriticisedfor alluding to child exploitation.The American Eagle campaign comes at a time when the US is witnessing a cultural shift centering whiteness as well as more conservative gender roles, while the Maga movement has been linked with promotinga “soft eugenics” way of thinking. In 2025, there are new factors reinforcing old stereotypes. For Halliday, the rise of GLP-1 medications for weight loss and the record high unemployment of Black women in the US all feed into a wider cultural shift that is “about recentering whiteness as what America is and who Americans look like.”Some fashion imagery is reflecting this wider regression. The blacklisted photographer Terry Richardson isshooting for magazines and brands again, while Dov Charney, whose role as CEO of American Apparel was terminated afterallegations of sexual misconduct, is now making content forhis new brandthat resemblesthe heavily sexualised noughties styleof his former brand’s advertising.For American Eagle, a brand whose biggest demographic is 15- to 25-year-old females, to tailor their campaign to the male gaze seems retrograde, if not downright creepy. However, Jane Cunningham, co-author ofBrandsplaining: Why Marketing is (Still) Sexist and How to Fix It, says many gen Z-ers who are fed a “hypersexualised visual diet” on social media may buy into the strategy. “Their attitude may be that they are ‘owning’ their sexuality by being overtly sexual in the way they present,” she says, pointing to the pop star Sabrina Carpenter as another example of someone who has also been accused of catering to the heterosexual male gaze.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are “extremely savvy as consumers”, she points out. “They have the kind of language and expertise in terms of deconstructing media that I couldn’t have dreamed of utilising as a teen during the 1990s. And they know when someone is trying to play them, which seems to be happening here.She adds: “It all feels like it was cooked up in a conference room to provoke maximum controversy and maximum outrage, and to get maximum attention.” And it seems – in the business sense at least – to be working.

Although it feels worlds away from nearby built-up areas, it’s easily accessible, and best approached on foot or by bike, sitting right on theTrans-Pennine trail. The beer garden stretches along the riverbank, and nursing a pint of ale on a summer evening while looking out across this tranquil section of the Mersey with all its birdlife is serenity. The 300-year-old tavern is all cosy low ceilings and wooden beams, perfection for the Sunday pub quiz, while Foodie Fridays attracts locals to themed cuisine from Mexican to Greek.

Being just outside the national park means the prices are also more Cumbrian (cheap) than at tourist traps in the Lakes.Michaelskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

During the summer, cows may wander freely on the other side of the pond – old grazing rights are still utilised on Cambridge’s commons. Moorhens, mute swans and herons are regular neighbours, the latter often statue-like at the water’s edge.

He wanted to see one of these hoops, so Anderson’s mother posted one over, and during a dinner party demonstration of the hoop, after a guest compared Anderson’s moves to those of a hula dancer, the name hula hoop was born.Hourglass figure ideal for mastering art of hula hooping, study findsRead more“There are so many stories about where the name came from, and they are all fictitious,” Anderson said in the film. “This is the true story about it.”Realising its potential as a toy product, the Andersons contacted an associate of Wayne’s named Arthur “Spud” Melin, the founder of the Wham-O toy company, whose instincts they trusted. They met in the company’s parking lot.“There were no witnesses; just Spud, my husband and myself,” Anderson recalled. “We told him we’ve called it the hula hoop, and he thought that was a great name for it.”Melin was intrigued and, as he and Wayne shook hands, he assured the Andersons that if the hula hoop made money for him, it would make money for them too.View image in fullscreenIn 1956, on a visit to her home town of Sydney, Joan Anderson noticed how many people were having fun with large bamboo hoops.Photograph: Chris Riess and Amy HillBy 1958, as the popularity of the hoops – now patented, plastic and produced by Wham-O – escalated and, with sales exceeding US$30m in two months, the Andersons’ phone calls remained unanswered, messages not returned.The only credit given to Joan Anderson was as the “friend from Australia” who had inspired Melin.“I think that bugged me more than anything,” Anderson said. “I was not a ‘friend’.”Joan Constance Manning was born in Sydney on 28 December 1923 to Claude and Ethel Manning. After leaving school at 14, she began modelling, with ambitions to become a film star. She was a diminutive figure, just over five feet tall, and was nicknamed the Pocket Venus.View image in fullscreenSomalian Australian circus artist Marawa, an inductee of the Guinness World Record Hall of Fame for her hooping prowess.Photograph: John Stillwell/PAIn December 1941, Joan was the cover girl of Pix magazine and was declared to be “a typical Australian holiday girl” whose war work included knitting socks and writing letters. She received a picture of herself from troops at Tobruk who wrote, “you make us forget Libya”.While swimming at Bondi beach in 1945, Joan was approached by US Army Air corps P-38 pilot Wayne Anderson, who did not make an impression until she saw him that night at a dance in his uniform. Four months later, they were married and, in early 1946, she joined hundreds of other war brides on their journey to America.In 1961, the Andersons filed a lawsuit against the Wham-O toy company and eventually settled with a small amount of compensation.“Why be angry with something you can’t change? The world isn’t fair but life goes on. I had a great life,” Joan Anderson said. “My husband lived to be 87 and we had 63 wonderful years together. Happiness is the best revenge.”She and Wayne had four children: Warren, Gary, Carl and Loralyn, three of whom survive her. Wayne died in 2007. Despite the hula hoop disappointment, the Anderson children all had hoops as they grew up.“It was never a big deal in our family. [My parents] went on with their lives. They knew they messed up with the business deal,” Loralyn Willis said.Somalian Australian circus artist Marawa, an inductee of the Guinness World Record Hall of Fame for her hooping prowess, met Anderson in 2018 and was struck by her grace over her lost business opportunity.“If I can be like Joan when I am 100 then I’ll be happy,” she said. “Meeting her made me realise I’ve made the right career choice for a long life.”Willis said her mother was “fun-loving, adventurous and willing to try anything”. She was ziplining, parasailing and boogie-boarding with her grandchildren until her mid-90s.“Mom was pretty happy that she got the recognition in the end and that she was able to bring so much joy to people around the world,” she said. “How can you hula hoop without being happy?”Explore more on these topicsToysFitnessDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Try Crocosmia – it’s a doddle to growGrown in a pot or with plenty of space in a bed, these blade-leafed corms will add hot reds and oranges to your planting schemesAlice VincentFri 1 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 06.18 EDTShareAs regular readers of this column may have noticed, I am no taxonomist. I’ve never quite got on board with Latin names, but have gardened long enough to grudgingly accept that they are quite useful. For all that common names can be poetic (love-in-a-mist), intriguing (bladder wrack) or plain entertaining (goat’s beard), they can lack specificity.I’m not here to get into the weeds of determining whether one naming system is superior, and I use both interchangeably, but it is true that some Latin names have a certain panache.Crocosmiais among them.Crocosmia(common name: coppertips, which sounds pleasingly like a jaunty 1950s nickname for a small, possibly naughty child) is a real doer in the garden at this time of year. It’s also not remotely shy, as you’ll know if you have it. It’s a doddle to grow, unfussy about soil and even tolerant of part-shade, so most of its custodians tend to find they have the opposite problem withCrocosmiain their growing space: with its tall, blade-like leaves, it can take over a plot.Give Crocosmia its due and give it space. Either by dedicating one massive pot to it or giving over a lot of flowerbedIf you’re a fan of big, bold, hot colours, it should be in your planting list. Ol’ coppertips has hundreds of cultivars, but as its common name suggests, the vast majority of them are in hues of orange and red. At the more subtle end of things isC. pottsii‘Culzean Pink’, which is a soft coral orange, with smaller flowers. Alternatively, you could go for the familiarC.‘Lucifer’, which boasts scarlet flowers in July and August. If you want that level of punch in a tighter space or container, the more modestC.‘Hellfire’ has bright-red flowers squeezed on to a smaller plant, and tends to be less invasive. There are also yolky yellow versions: ‘Citrone Spray’, which will bloom later into September, or ‘Columbus’.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The coveted outdoor kitchenRead morePersonally, I’ve never been able to accommodate one in my own small garden; the colour palette here is a tight pink, white and yellow situation. But when I think ofCrocosmiaI think of the garden that changed my mind on this plant, which belonged to a late friend and fantastic gardener. She planted it alongside plume poppies (Macleaya cordata), across a wide, deep bed. Everything had enough space, and the arching red sprays of theCrocosmiacomplemented the soft waft of the poppies’ beautiful fig-leaf foliage. After a summer storm it stood proud, beaded with rainwater. Heaven.With that in mind, I’d advise that you giveCrocosmiaits due and give it space. That could be dedicating one massive pot to a few corms (plant them in spring if you don’t want to pick them up as plants from a nursery now), or giving over a lot of a flowerbed. When else do you get the opportunity to let hellfire break loose in the garden?Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A butterfly has landed. There is no gap between seeing the butterfly and recognising it as a male purple emperor. I check the bin scene in disbelief: keys, glasses, phone, His Imperial Majesty (as he is known to admirers). Ragged and abraded of scales, his wings are swathed in royal purple light. A starry Disney wizard’s cloak.View image in fullscreen‘Ragged and abraded of scales, his wings are swathed in royal purple light.’Photograph: Nicola ChesterHe turns, loses his gilding in the new angle of light, and becomes reminiscent of a dusty armchair. The loose constellations on his raised forewings and the crescent of white, messy-edged darts look as though spray paint has bled from under a stencil. On one hindwing is a single tortoiseshell eyespot; the other has been torn away in nips and thorn tears. If this is a king of kings, he is a raggedy one.I pick up my phone to photograph this extraordinary visitor. Purple emperors feed in treetops, on sap and honeydew, only descending for salts and minerals on rotting things and animal dung. It’s been a (relatively) great yearfor butterfly numbers, but even so.This is my third incidental encounter with His Imperial Majesty. The first floated on to rudbeckia flowers when I was on the landline to Mum 17 years ago, exhausted with three young children and with 200 miles between us. Now she is in the village, and shortly we’ll be moving in alongside her. My second purple emperor was on a towpath dog poo. A runner paused to see what I’d found and I pointed in delight to a suddenly vacant pile of excrement.It seems inauspicious that such an elusive, aristocratic butterfly should be photographed on a bungalow bin lid. But I choose to claim this as the opposite: a sign that all will be well here at Mum’s, a mile from our home of 21 years where I saw my first.Finally, the butterfly powers away, as if he has torn free from the pins and dust of a Victorian collector’s display cabinet.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsButterfliesCountry diaryRural affairsInsectsWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Labubu-themed drinks. A chance to meet and greet a life-size Labubu.This was the scene at a recent meetup at an outdoor shopping center in southernCalifornia, where dozens of people gathered for the chance to get their hands on one of the wildly popular fluffy dolls.Vendor stalls, prepped with their Labubu-themed merchandise, lined the parking lot of the Stonewood center in Downey, a city in south-east Los Angeles. Children bounced on the white trampoline featuring pink and blue streamers where they posed with cutouts of a chestnut Labubu, providing pops of color for the perfect photo opportunity. Children and adults strolled with bags of Labubus and other figurine collectibles sold by Pop Mart, the Chinese toy retailer. Dozens crowded the tent of a reseller who was raffling away “blind bags” that contained a mysterious mix of different versions and styles of Labubu.Labubu underground: Lafufu makers defy Chinese authorities to feed the world’s appetite for viral dollRead moreSince hitting the market in 2019, Labubus have become a global phenomenon. Their popularity has been fueled by social media posts of live unboxings that showcase rare collections. Launches of new editions sell out on Pop Mart within minutes, sending the company’sprofits soaringover the past year.Celebrities likeRihanna,Emma RobertsandLisaonly fed the frenzy by clipping the dolls on to their handbags, branding them as the new “luxury” accessories and leading fans to do whatever it takes to get their hands on one.Avid collectors say that acquiring the dolls has become almost like a “social currency”, according to one meetup attender, with the trend showing no signs of slowing down even as the prices climb, and knock-offs of the dollsbecome a growing problem.“If you know about it, you’re in and if you don’t, you’re outside of it. It’s definitely social currency,” says Steven Limones.Limones came to the meetup with his longtime friend Joshua Fornes, to build their collection of Pop Mart figurines. Limones said his passion for collecting began when his husband was given a Labubu by Fornes for Christmas. “I was like, ‘Oh, that’s cute.’ And then I saw[the British stylist] Harry Lambert [wearing] a Labubu on Boxing Day. So the day after Christmas, I thought, ‘Now I like it.’”Labubu comes from the imagination of creator Kasing Lungwho was inspiredby Nordic fairytales after moving to the Netherlands from Hong Kong at the age of seven. It wasn’t until 2019 that Lung partnered with Pop Mart to bring the unique creatures to life.Each Labubu doll is featured in different collections, and sold in “blind boxes” that only reveal their contents when opened, adding to the thrill for collectors. Each collection usually features six color options and one “secret doll”. The chances of drawing each option in a set is 1/6 , with Pop Mart guaranteeing no repeats within a purchased set.The small, monster-like creatures have pointed ears similar to an elf, but with the devilish twist of serrated teeth. Nine of them to be exact. Any other number and you may have a “lafufu” on your hands.“It’s this cute thing, but there’s an edge to it that not everyone likes”, says Limones.Labubu’s rising popularity has ultimately led to a rise in price – a reality that hasn’t sat well with many loyal fans. Until recently, Labubus sold for $21.99. A month ago, Pop Mart increased that price to $27.99 without formally making an announcement, leading customers to voice their frustrations on forums suchas Reddit. Some suspected thatDonald Trump’s tariffs on Chinacould be to blame, but the company denied thatin a statement posted to TikTok liveand said that the reason for the price increase was “based on our brand overall operational strategy to ensure we continue delivering our high quality products for you guys in the future”.Still, getting your hands on a Labubu won’t get easier anytime soon. Pop Mart has eliminated certain Labubu launches on their main website, making them accessible only through the Pop Mart app in order toreduce bots and discourage resellers. However, users have reported the app crashing during thecheckout process. Pop Mart has also put a pause on selling products in stores,due to reportsof fights breaking out between customers over the dolls.Joshua Fornes was among those expressing frustration about how Pop Mart has changed the way it launches new dolls, pivoting their format from scheduled launches on the Pop Mart app and website to random drop times.“Now it’s just incredibly difficult,” he says. “You can’t even go to stores any more and wait in line because it gets too hectic, because people are crazy trying to buy them.”Pop Mart did not respond to a Guardian request for comment before publication.Resellers are also struggling with price increases from the wholesale suppliers they buy from overseas. Princess Bautista ofAmari collectibles, a vendor at the Labubu meet and greet, began reselling in February after becoming invested in collecting the popular dolls herself. She said she had been personally feeling the effects of the price increase on her business. Some of her suppliers, she said, had tripled their price for popular collections, such as the Exciting Macaron series.“I was gonna give up about, like, two, three weeks ago, because of the prices,” she said. Despite that, she plans to keep going because the “hype” is still driving sales. “That’s why I still buy them for whatever price. Customers will still buy them.”Despite the rising prices and changes in the launch process, dedicated buyers and sellers at the meetup said the Labubu craze wasn’t slowing down just yet. Whether the trend will repeat a history similar to the Beanie Babies before them remains to be seen.Steve remarks: “The Labubu is here. It’s here for now. Who knows if it’s here to stay. Enjoy it.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastShopping tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I know the country very well, I have a lot of family there, and I’m very interested in what happens there.“But home is where my now family is, and my now family is my children, it’s my husband and my brother and his children, in-laws. The Conservative party is very much part of my family, my extended family, I call it.”In 1980 Badenoch was among the last people to automatically receive British citizenship because she was born in the UK. Margaret Thatcher abolished birthright citizenship the following year.“Finding out that I did have that British citizenship was a marvel to so many of my contemporaries, so many of my peers,” she said.“I think the reason that I came back here was actually a very sad one, and it was that my parents thought: ‘There is no future for you in this country.’” She recalled “never quite feeling that I belonged there”.The future Tory leader moved back to the UK aged 16 to live with a friend of her mother because of the worsening political and economic situation in Nigeria, and to study for her A-levels.When Badenoch’s father, Femi Adegoke, who was a doctor, died in Nigeria in 2022 she obtained a visa to travel there, which she described as a “big fandango”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They hijacked the catamaran Simplicity on the following day and then headed to nearby St Vincent, where they were arrested, according to authorities.The non-profit Salty Dawg Sailing Association had said that Hendry and Brandel were “veteran cruisers” and longtime members of the association, calling them “warm-hearted and capable”.It said the couple was spending the winter cruising in the easternCaribbean.Explore more on these topicsGrenadaCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump also slapped a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports in response to what he called the “witch-hunt” against the far-right former president.On Friday, Moraes, a shaven-headed Muay Thai practitioner known by the nickname Xandão (‘Big Al’), came out swinging. He told the court that Trump’s tariffs and the “spurious” sanctions targeting him and other supreme court justices recentlystripped of their US visas, were part of an “illegal and immoral” ruse to obstruct justice that was being engineered by a group of Brazilian “traitors” who had lobbied foreign authorities to carry out “hostile acts” against the country’s economy.Moraes said the campaign’s objectives were identical to those of the 8 January 2023 riots in the capital, Brasília, when hardcore Bolsonaro supporters stormed the supreme court, congress and presidential palace in an attempt to reverse his election defeat. Those rioters, Moraes said, had hoped to generate social chaos that would provoke a military intervention and make way for a coup.Two and a half years later, Moraes claimed that by lobbying foreign authorities to impose tariffs, the Brazilians behind the alleged plot were trying to trigger “an economic crisis, that would create a social and then a political crisis so that, once again, there might be social instability and the chance of a new putschist attack”.“To the disappointment of these Brazilian traitors, [that] will not occur,” the judge added.Moraes did not name the “supposedly patriotic Brazilians” he claimed were leading the supposed plot from overseas. But his comments were an unmistakable reference to Bolsonaro’s third son, the congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, who moved to the US in February and has admitted to lobbying Trump officials to pressure Brazil over his father’s plight. After Trump hit Moraes with sanctions this week, the younger Bolsonaro thanked him and said: “I have a feeling of mission accomplished”.The supreme court’s coup trial is expected to conclude in the coming weeks and Bolsonaro – who has denied leading a power grab – is expected to be convicted and sentenced to up to 43 years, meaning the 70-year-old could spend the rest of his life in jail.Moraes vowed that the court’s work would continue as normal, despite the “ham-fisted” attempts at coercion. There would be no “cowardly surrender” from its members as they sought to defend their country’s democracy.‘Classic tinpot dictator’: Trump exports his assault on democracy to BrazilRead moreTrump’s attempt to pressure Brazil’s government and judiciary over Bolsonaro’s fate has sparked the most severe diplomatic crisis between Brazil and the US in decades. “The US government’s interference in the Brazilian justice system is unacceptable,” Lula said on Wednesday, after Trump signed his tariffs into force and hit Moraes with Magnitsky sanctions normally reserved for the perpetrators of severe human rights violations.Polls suggest most Brazilians oppose Trump’s attempts to meddle in the functioning of their country’s institutions.Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist and Latin America expert, believed Trump was trying to punish the government of a country which had “done a better job than the US by quite some distance at holding an authoritarian leader accountable”.“Right now, Brazil is more democratic than the United States,” Levitsky said.“Brazil’s democracy is flawed. It’s got problems. It’s polarized. But it’s a real functioning democracy and of course many Brazilians are pissed off that the Trump administration is trying to use trade policy to undermine the legal process there.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaDonald TrumpAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Tomorrow they will regret it,” she said, comparing El Salvador’s slide into authoritarianism to the collapse of Venezuela’s democracy.“When all the orders come from one person and everything revolves around one single person, democracy no longer exists. And when you lose democracy … it takes years to get it back,” Villatoro warned.Loyalists of Bukele – a social media-savvy 44-year-old who once called himself “the world’s coolest dictator” – celebrated the reforms, which will also see presidential terms extended from five years to six and bring the presidential election scheduled for 2029 forward to 2027. The election’s second round will also be scrapped.Bukele-mania: El Salvador strongman’s crime clampdown excites regional rightRead moreSuecy Callejas, one of 54 Nuevas Ideas lawmakers in El Salvador’s 60-seat assembly, tweeted: “The constitution isn’t untouchable. What should be untouchable is the WILL of the people. And today, more than ever, the people are at the centre of our decisions.”Bukele, who is one of Donald Trump’s top Latin American allies, was first elected in 2019 and was re-elected last year thanks to widespread public support for his hardline crackdown on gangs, which has seen homicide rates plummet.That three-year clampdown has seen 2% of El Salvador’s adult population jailed and due process suspended, and made Bukele a role model for rightwing Latin American politicians grappling with high crime rates, and for members of Trump’s Maga movement.But Bukele’s concentration of power has horrified opposition politicians and activists. Juanita Goebertus, Human Rights Watch’s Americas director, compared El Salvador’s scrapping of presidential term limits toVenezuela’s 2009 referendum, which approved the same measure under its then populist president Hugo Chávez.Sixteen years later, Chávez’s heir, Nicolás Maduro, remains in power, having claimed a third term last year despite apparently losing the July 2024 election. “[El Salvador is] traveling down the same path as Venezuela,” Goebertuswarned. “It starts with a leader who uses his popularity to concentrate power, and it ends in dictatorship.”In a rare interview with the foreign media last year, Bukele said he would not seek re-election, citing the constitutional “prohibition” which was this week removed. “Also, we have an agreement with my wife that this is my last term,” Bukeletold Time magazine, musing that he might write a book after leaving power.Few believe Bukele will honour that pledge. “Welcome to the club of the authoritarian dictatorships of Maduro, [Daniel] Ortega, [Miguel] Díaz Canel,” tweeted Carlos FernandoChamorro, a prominent Nicaraguan journalist forced into exile because of his country’s democratic decline.Explore more on these topicsEl SalvadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Between 23 and 29 July, Beijing and its surrounding areas recorded an average of 166mm, equivalent to the monthly norm.The suburban district of Miyun received the highest amount of rainfall, with 543mm recorded, equivalent to the region’s annual average. The death toll included 31 people in a Miyun care home, 10 who were swept away in a minibus in Shangxi province, and eight people in a landslide in the city of Chengde.Floods alsodamaged roads and vital infrastructure, cutting off more than 130 rural villages and leading to the evacuation of more than 80,000 people from their homes.The increasing frequency of high-rainfall events inChinahas been linked to rising global temperatures; each degree in warming enables the atmosphere to hold 7% more moisture.Meanwhile, Japan is braced for Tropical Storm Krosa on Friday, which is expected to skirt past the south-eastern Kanto region via the Izu islands. Although Krosa travelled towards Japan during its initial north-westerly path, a forecasted change to a more north-easterly direction means the system is likely to avoid a direct hit. However, its close proximity to the Chiba region may bring 120-200mm of rain in 24 hours.This week, as much of Europe experiences below-average temperatures, parts of Scandinavia have been engulfed by unusually intense heat. Prolonged heatwave conditions swept the north of the continent in mid-July, driven by exceptionally high sea-surface temperatures off Norway’s northern coast and a stubborn area of high pressure that brought sunny weather and sinking, compressing air.As a result, temperatures in Norway, Sweden and Finland rose 8-10C (46-40F) above seasonal norms and remained elevated for nearly two weeks. The Norwegian counties of Trøndelag and Nordland exceeded 30C for 13 consecutive days, including in Storforsheia, just north of the Arctic Circle. It was the warmest two-week period on record in several areas.In the past week, the heat has shifted north and east, easing across much of Norway and Sweden and pushing temperatures 10-15C above normal in Finland and north-western Russia. Temperatures in the upper 20s celsius are likely to persist for at least the next five days several hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerFloodingChinaAsia PacificExtreme weatheranalysisShareReuse this content"

At its peak, such an operation would create more than 10,000 full-time jobs, according to an Adani consultant’s report published in 2013.The then head of Adani mining, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, said the Australian operations would deliver $22bn in taxes and royalties to be invested “right back into frontline services”.View image in fullscreenThe logo of Adani Group on the facade of its Corporate House on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India, November 21, 2024.Photograph: Amit Dave/ReutersThe “10,000 jobs [and] $22bn in royalties and taxes” pledge became a mantra that was even featured in Adani TV advertisements.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIt would be a win-win for the state and federal governments – royalties would flow to the state and company tax to the commonwealth – both of which needed to issue approvals.Despite $22bn promise, Adani has paid zero corporate tax in Australia and experts think it won’t ever pay a centRead moreIrresistible richesThe Carmichael emissions would, of course, be colossal, producing 4.7bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent over its lifetime, once the mine, its operations and the burning of its coal were taken into account, according to analysis by the Australia Institute at the time.Annual emissions would be double the average produced by Tokyo, and three times that of New Delhi.The ensuing battle between environmentalists and the coalminer divided communities; but Adani’s jobs and economic benefit pledge seemed irresistible – until it changed.In 2015, conservationists went to the Queensland land court, seeking a recommendation that Adani’s applications for an environmental approval and mining lease for Carmichael be refused.The research director at the Australia Institute, Rod Campbell, says “Adani’s lawyers realised that the 10,000 jobs claim was unsupportable, so they bit the bullet”.Campbell, who provided economic analysis for the proceedings opposing Adani, says the coalminer changed consultants and argued in court for a more modest jobs claim “but otherwise sang the praises of the mine”.The new economic models brought the expected job numbers down to fewer than 1,500.By 2015, the anticipated tonnes coming out of the mine had also reduced, from 60m a year to 40m; it would later reduce to 10m.But the projected corporate tax take still appeared strong, with the project forecast to generate about $400m a year under the new forecasts.Adani’s modelling was broadly accepted by the court, even though critics pointed out it didn’t account for tax minimisation strategies.‘Billions for taxpayers’By 2017, Adani’s bid for a subsidised commonwealth loan was unravelling, and global banks were concerned about the economics and reputational damage of funding the new coal project.The mine’s supporters doubled down, led by industry groups including the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA), which called on policymakers to back the project.The MCA chief executive, Tania Constable, said in 2018 the Queensland and Australian economies would benefit from thousands of new regional jobs.View image in fullscreenA coal ship docked at Abbot Point coal port on April 25, 2019 in Bowen, Australia. The port has a capacity of 50 million tonnes and is leased to Adani Enterprises of India.Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images“And through mining taxes and royalties, the Carmichael mine will generate billions of dollars for taxpayers over decades to fund nurses, teachers, police, hospitals, roads and other services and infrastructure for Queensland families and communities,” Constable said.The MCA was contacted for comment.Adani would go on to finance the project itself, although it would be a smaller project than it had envisaged, given the lack of external funding.Adani claims its export program helps contribute to sustainable energy – but experts say that’s ‘wilful disinformation’Read more“The coal will be sold to customers in the Asia-Pacific region at index adjusted pricing, which means all taxes and royalties will be paid here in Australia,” Adani said in late 2021, after assembling its first shipment of thermal coal at the port.‘Bing, bing, warning bells going off’The Indian conglomerate couldn’t have timed the project any better.In late 2021, prices for energy commodities had started to surge in line with the rising tension between Russia and Ukraine.Coalprices then spiked to record highs after the Russian invasion in early 2022.In its first few months of operation, Adani’s mine generated more than $32.5m in revenue, according to accounts lodged with the regulator. But it recorded an operating loss after costs, leading to zero tax payable.This pattern would repeat, even as revenue increased.In the 2025 reporting period, it earned $1.27bn in revenue, but once again recorded a paper loss, as various related-party transactions and interest payments erased profits.Tim Buckley, a former investment banker and the director of Climate Energy Finance, describes Adani’s finances as an “extremely complex, opaque corporate structure”.Jason Ward, the principal analyst at the Centre for International CorporateTaxAccountability and Research, says the volume of related-party transactions is “pretty unprecedented” and that it is set up to never pay tax.“Every page of their financials is like, ‘bing, bing, warning bells going off’,” says Ward.Adani has paid royalties – payments made to governments to extract state-owned minerals – with a $78.6m payment in the 2025 accounts, and $83.5m in 2024.View image in fullscreenBob Brown speaks during a stop-Adani rally outside Parliament House on May 05, 2019 in Canberra.Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty ImagesIts most recent accounts list just 84 direct employees at the mine, however it uses a mining services provider to hire other workers.A spokesperson for Adani’s Australian mining business, which is branded BravusMiningand Resources, says Adani has invested more than $2.5bn into Australia’s economy.“Today, more than 1,200 Queenslanders are employed at the Carmichael mine in full-time operational roles to produce high-quality thermal coal for the export market,” the Bravus spokesperson says.“Developing nations in the Asia-Pacific region use coal from the Carmichael mine alongside renewables to provide reliable and affordable energy solutions that help reduce poverty and power growth.”While there is no suggestion Adani has acted illegally, several politicians have expressed frustration that a large resources company can pay less company tax than a low-paid worker pays in income tax.The independent senator David Pocock said on X: “Why on earth do successive [governments] keep allowing giant multinational companies to reap super profits from the sale of our resources without paying tax?”Independent MP Zali Steggall says Adani is a “cautionary tale”, and that policymakers should reform the approvals process to place conditions on miners to meet their stated promises.She says companies invariably overstate project benefits which “magically disappear once the operations commence, especially when you’re talking about foreign-owned corporations”.“Time and time again, we see state and federal ministers and governments approve projects on flimsy assurances that don’t come true,” says Steggall.“It’s time there was proper accountability for Australian resources so that we stop giving it away in the manner we are at the moment.”Jonathan Barrett is Guardian Australia’s business editorExplore more on these topicsCarmichael coalmineAdani GroupTaxBusinessMiningCoalanalysisShareReuse this content"

The country is the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, but is also theworld’s biggest supplier and installer of clean energy technology.The share of coal in China’s power mix has dropped to the lowest level since 2016, to just over 50%.Joyce’s bill is scheduled for debate in August when parliament returns for another sitting fortnight.The Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan is leadingthe party’s review of net zero policiesin the wake of the 3 May election. He said Australia should build new coal-fired power stations, like developments happening in China, the US, India and Indonesia.The Nationals’ net zero bomb threatens to fracture the Liberals’ decades-old alliance – permanentlyRead more“I think we should put Australians first because nothing we do is going to change any temperature of the globe one iota by not building a coal-fired power station,” Canavan said.“But if we do build some new cheap coal-fired power stations, we just may save manufacturing jobs in this country, bring down the cost of energy and bring down the cost of everyday goods for Australians.”According to theCSIRO’s 2024-25 GenCost report, renewables, firmed by gas and backed by transmission, remain the cheapest new form of electricity generation technology.The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, said on Thursday the party would have a settled position within “a couple of months”.Net zero underpins Australia’s participation in the Paris climate agreement. Independent authorities,including the CSIRO, say failing to stem carbon emissions will lead to changes in weather including extreme heat, heavy rainfall, coastal inundation, bushfires and drought, while exacerbating health and wellbeing problems and causing destruction of ecosystems and species.Joyce has teamed up with his former rival and another ex-Nationals leader, Michael McCormack. McCormack said emissions should not be curbed at the expense of manufacturing, farming or food supply.“By constructing tens of thousands of kilometres of transmission lines across rural and regional Australia in pursuit of a false ideology, the government is industrialising fertile rural farmland on a massive scale,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many of the opponents of net zero are advocates for nuclear being included in Australia’s energy supply.The shadow energy and emissions reductions minister, Dan Tehan, confirmed this week his review for theLiberal partywould take nine to 12 months.“The key focus between now and Christmas is going to be on gas,” he said in a press conference with the opposition leader, Sussan Ley.“We need to bring more gas on to the system, but also we need to explore carbon capture and storage.”Coalition frontbencher Andrew Hastie helped win support for an anti-net zero motion at last weekend’s Western Australia Liberal state conference.He did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian about alternatives to net zero, but said in an email to supporters his opposition “reflects a growing concern from mainstream Australians about our expensive energy bills, unreliable supply, and the erosion of our national sovereignty”.The former prime minister Tony Abbott ischeering on anti-net zero movesfrom outside parliament, including in an Institute of Public Affairs podcast this week.“If we are in favour of net zero, all of these economy-damaging measures are justified. If we want to avoid the economy-damaging measures, perhaps we do need to make that very symbolic act of saying, ‘well, actually, we’re not committed to net zero,’” he said.In an interview with former Canadian conservative politician Derek Fildebrandt in June, Abbott said Australia should continue to rely on fossil fuels. He said cutting emissions would cause “us to live like the Amish, or worse”.“If climate change is approached as a moral issue, the left wins. If climate change is approached as an economic issue, the right wins,” he said.“Yes, I accept that climate does change, that mankind does make a difference, and that we should do what we can to reduce emissions, but I would always add this critical rider – but not if it costs you your job, costs us our industries, and puts up your cost of living.”Explore more on these topicsCoalitionEnergyNational partyBarnaby JoyceParis climate agreementAustralian politicsCoalnewsShareReuse this content"

The response was a thumbs up emoji from the retired businessman from Newcastle.But Armstrong, speaking by his Bentley car outside his whitewashed villa, wearing only his underpants, said he had nothing to hide.“I did not know he is here,” Armstrong said. “Nobody’s told me that. The girl I spoke to, she said: ‘No, he’s in mainlandSpain.’ Maybe when he comes out here, he might see me once, maybe twice, no more than twice.”Tenerife was Tommy Robinson’s safe place, said Nick Lowles, a biographer of the far-right activist.View image in fullscreenCalling at Villa Elite in Costa Adeje, where Robinson is known to have stayed previously.Photograph: Phil Crean/The GuardianIt was where he ran to in 2020 as “his life was spiralling out of control” before a very expensive libel trial over his false claims against a 15-year-old Syrian refugee.The address he gave to court then was a 10-bedroom villa in the south of the island, described as a “private haven of prestige”.The largest Canary island emerged again this week to be Robinson’s bolthole of choice in a moment of peril, although friends insist there was nothing untoward about the timing of his trip.Robinson had been filmed by a fellow passenger getting on to a shuttle bus at Tenerife South airport after taking the 5.55am Ryanair flight from Stansted on Tuesday.View image in fullscreenFriends of Tommy Robinson insisted there was nothing untoward about his trip to Tenerife.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAMobile phone footage had spread on social media of Robinson pacing close to a prone body at London St Pancras station. He is heard telling concerned onlookers: “You saw him, he came at me.”The Met police issued a statement saying they wished to question a 42-year-old man, understood to be Robinson, over an alleged assault the previous evening. The injured man was discharged from hospital on Wednesday.Speaking on Friday, Armstrong said he had first met Robinson “five or six years” ago at a restaurant through “a mate of mine”.The friend in question was Lutz Bachmann, the leader of the Patriotische Europäer gegen die Islamisierung des Abendlandes (Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, or Pegida movement), a far-right German political organisation that hit the headlines a decade ago after its mass marches in Dresden.Bachmann has 22 convictions in Germany, including for drug trafficking, tax evasion and child support offences.He has called African refugees “gangs of rapists” and “throat cutters”. He was banned from entering the UK in 2018 on the grounds that his presence was “not conducive to the public good”.Bachmann moved to Tenerife eight years ago and, with Armstrong, they appear to have formed something of a support network.In his biography of Robinson, Lowles wrote that it was Armstrong who helped fund a campaign bus in 2019 during his failed attempt to get a seat in the European parliament.View image in fullscreenThe Hemingway cafe in Costa Adeje, a favourite  breakfast spot for Robinson.Photograph: Phil Crean/The GuardianArmstrong said the media told lies about Robinson, but then his own record is patchy.He was convicted of printing money “in the 70s, 80s”, he confirmed. He also served two months in HMP Brixton after being convicted at Southwark crown court in 2000 for having control of counterfeit share certificates for blue chip UK companies and drafts in the name of an international bank.“I could have appealed that and got out of it,” Armstrong said. Not that prison proved a chore. “Loved it,” he said, “made some lovely friends there. But getting back to Tommy, I swear to God I didn’t know he was here.”Armstrong said he usually stayed in a “posh hotel” on the coast and not with him, and would work out at a gym in a shopping mall. Bachmann had not seen Robinson either, he further claimed.“I spoke to him yesterday and he said he hadn’t,” he said. “I said: ‘Is Tommy over?’ And he said: ‘He’s not.’ He would tell me. We are mates. Then I heard from somebody else that he is on mainland Spain. It’s a mystery to me”.Explore more on these topicsTommy RobinsonFar rightSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Ricardo Junior was playful, kind, and always smiling. They brought so much love, laughter, and energy into the lives of everyone around them. Their absence has left an unbearable silence not just for their parents, but for their whole family, who were incredibly close and shared an unbreakable bond.”Kayla Jasvinder Del-Brocco, the children’s aunt, toldBirminghamLiveher niece and nephew had been swept away from the beach by powerful currents. “They went out to swim together with their dad as they loved the beach. Mum said ‘don’t be long’ and took her little one to the bathroom. She came back out and couldn’t see anyone. That’s when the nightmare commenced.”Emergency services were called to Llarga beach, near Tarragona, shortly after 8.45pm local time on Tuesday, Catalonia’s civil protection agency has said. Ricardo Senior remains in hospital after being pulled from the water unconscious, it was reported.Jose Luis Gargallo, the head of the local police force in Salou, said on Wednesday: “There were three people who were having serious difficulty getting out of the sea. There was a father with his son and daughter, of British nationality.“When they got out, both of them, the boy and girl, aged 11 and 13, showed no signs of life. Attempts were made to resuscitate them with CPR, but they were unsuccessful.“The father, fortunately, was able to be saved. He had swallowed a lot of water, he was exhausted, very fatigued, but the father was able to be saved thanks to the emergency services.”A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of two British children who have died inSpainand are in contact with the local authorities.”Marquis-Johnson has set up a fundraiser to help with the cost of repatriation.Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In recent weeks, Trump has markedly changed his rhetoric on the conflict, appearing less conciliatory to Putin and more amenable to enhanced support for Ukraine. He called Russia’s continued attacks on civilian areas “disgusting” on Thursday.Last month Trump said he was “disappointed” with Putin. “We’ll have a great conversation. I’ll say: ‘That’s good, I’ll think we’re close to getting it done,’ and then he’ll knock down a building in Kyiv,”he told the BBC.Seemingly referencing Trump’s comments, Putin said on Friday: “As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule.”Drone and missile strike graphicThe death toll from a series of Russian strikes on Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday rose sharply on Friday, to 31, after rescuers found more than a dozen bodies in the rubble of an apartment block that had collapsed after one of the strikes. There were five children among the dead, including a two-year-old, while 159 people were wounded in the attack, one of the worst to hit the Ukrainian capital in more than three years of full-scale war.Putin has periodically claimed to be interested in peace, but only on terms wholly unacceptable to Kyiv. Last week, the third round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, but broke up in less than an hour and have so far led to no agreements except on prisoner exchanges.View image in fullscreenRescuers walk past a Kyiv apartment block that was hit by a Russian missile strike overnight.Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/ReutersSpeaking to reporters at a meeting with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, in northern Russia, Putin said he hoped the peace talks would continue, and that they should be conducted “without cameras and in a calm atmosphere”.Ukraine, however, says Russia has shown it is not serious about the talks by sending a low-level delegation led by Vladimir Medinsky, a former culture minister known for writing patriotic books about history. “This level of delegation does not have the authority to negotiate, just to spew insults and announce demands,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, a Zelenskyy aide, in an interview in Kyiv.Zelenskyy has said he wants to meet Putin one-on-one, with either Trump or the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as moderator. On Friday, he responded to Putin’s claim of being interested in peace with another suggestion to meet.“If this is a signal of serious readiness to end the war with dignity and establish a truly lasting peace, and not just an attempt to buy more time for the war and delay sanctions, then Ukraine once again confirms its readiness to meet at the leaders’ level at any time,” Zelenskyy wrote on his Telegram channel.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineUS foreign policyEuropeVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Just uttering that word – ‘genocide’ – in reference toIsrael, to the Jewish people, that alone, the fact that this association can even be made, should be enough to tell us that something very wrong is happening to us.”Grossman said that for many years he had refused to use the term. “But now I can’t help myself – not after what I’ve read in the papers, not after the images I’ve seen, not after speaking with people who’ve been there. This word is an avalanche: once you say it, it just gets bigger, like an avalanche. And it adds even more destruction and suffering,” he said.Grossman’s comments come days aftertwo major Israeli rights groups said Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, amid growing global alarm over starvation in the besieged territory.The author, who has long been a critic of the Israeli government, told La Repubblica he was using the word “with immense pain and with a broken heart”.At least 91 killed seeking aid in Gaza as US envoy Steve Witkoff visits IsraelRead more“Reading in a newspaper or hearing in conversations with friends in Europe the association of the words ‘Israel’ and ‘hunger’ – especially when this comes from our own history, from our supposed sensitivity to human suffering, from the moral responsibility we’ve always claimed to hold toward every human being, not just toward Jews – this is devastating,” said Grossman, who won the country’s top literary prize, the Israel prize, in 2018 for his work spanning more than three decades.“The occupation has corrupted us,” he said. “I am absolutely convinced that Israel’s curse began with the occupation of thePalestinian territoriesin 1967. Maybe people are tired of hearing about it, but that’s the truth. We’ve become militarily powerful, and we’ve fallen into the temptation born of our absolute power, and the idea that we can do anything.”Asked what he thought of France and the UK being among the latest countries preparing to formallyrecognise a state of Palestine, Grossman said: “I actually think it’s a good idea, and I don’t understand the hysteria around it here in Israel. Maybe dealing with a real state, with real obligations, rather than a vague entity like the Palestinian Authority, will have its advantages. Of course, there would need to be very clear conditions: no weapons, and the guarantee of transparent elections from which anyone who advocates violence against Israel is excluded.”He said he remained “desperately committed” to the two-state solution. “It will be complex, and both we and the Palestinians will need to act with political maturity in the face of the inevitable attacks that will come.” He added: “There is no other plan.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warDavid GrossmanGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaHuman rightsIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Al-Saraya field hospital said it had received more than 100 dead and wounded after the shooting, while the death toll was expected to rise, the Associated Press reported.On Thursday morning, 19 people seeking aid were killed by Israeli soldiers outside aid distribution points in the centralGazaStrip and in Rafah in south Gaza.Gaza is in the throes of famine,according to the international authority on food insecurity. Seven children died of hunger on Wednesday, bringing the total number of malnutrition deaths to 154, the Gaza health authority said.Gaza graphic“Dying of starvation is slow and painful,” the World Health Organization said in a statement on Thursday. “A starving child, among the most vulnerable, might cry constantly from pain until becoming too weak to even do that. If not urgently treated, a child with acute malnutrition will die.”The UN agency added that it would take “months, if not years” to reverse what it called a “man-made tragedy”.As Gaza’s famine has deepened, social order has broken down. It is common for crowds of hundreds of desperate people to wait for the rare aid truck to enter Gaza and to loot the vehicle once it arrives.Starvation graphicMore than 1,000 people have been shot, primarily by Israeli soldiers, while trying to get food from the private US Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and while waiting for aid trucks by border crossings.The UN has said the key to stopping the looting of aid is to reassure the population that a constant, adequate supply will enter Gaza. Israel controls aid crossings into Gaza and has been accused of creating the hunger crisis through its blockades of humanitarian supplies – something it denies, alongside its rejection that there is starvation in Gaza.Trump threatens Canada on trade deal after Carney moves to recognise PalestineRead moreIsrael recently expanded aid access into Gaza, but humanitarians have said the new measures will not reverse the starvation crisis and have called for urgent, unfettered aid access into Gaza.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said on Wednesday that the amount of food being brought into Gaza was “far from enough”.The foreign minister of Cyprus announced on Thursday that his country was working to reactivate a sea route to ship humanitarian aid to Gaza. Cyprus had previously helped deliver about 2,200 tonnes of aid to Gaza last year, before several incidents stopped the route altogether.Constantinos Kombos said more planning was needed before reopening the sea corridor. He called the situation in Gaza “unacceptable, unbearable” and said aid must be let into the territory “so that it has tangible, visible outcomes immediately”.As the hunger crisis worsened, Witkoff landed in Israel, where he met the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli media reported that they discussed the flagging ceasefire talks and the White House later announced that Witkoff and the US ambassador, Mike Huckabee, would travel to Gaza on Friday “to inspect the current [food] distribution sites and secure a plan to deliver more food and meet with local Gazans to hear first-hand about this dire situation on the ground”.graphicIsrael sent a response on Wednesday to Hamas’s latest ceasefire plan, which proposed a 60-day pause in fighting and a hostage-prisoner exchange.The US president, Donald Trump, called on Hamas to surrender and release the remaining Israeli hostages. The group holds about 50 captives, 20 of whom are believed to be living.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!”Trump had suggested on Wednesday that the US would partner with Israel to run new food distribution points in Gaza, but has given few details about what this plan would look like. The GHF has the backing of the Trump administration and is chaired by an associate of Trump, but it was not clear whether the US would work through the private initiative.Israel has come under huge international pressure as images of starving people have prompted an outcry. More than a dozen countries have condemned Israel for its conduct in Gaza and taken steps torecognise the Palestinian state– a largely symbolic move.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestinian demonstrators march during a rally in Toronto on 6 April.Photograph: Anadolu/GettySeveral countries,including Canada, said they would move toward recognising a Palestinian state in September. Canada’s recognition would be contingent on some changes within the Palestinian Authority, Mark Carney, the prime minister, said.Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said before a visit to Israel on Thursday that recognition of a Palestinian state should come at the end of talks on a two-state solution, but said Berlin would respond to any unilateral actions, after citing “annexation threats” by some Israeli ministers.On Tuesday, the European Commission proposed a partial suspension of Israel from its most prestigious science research programme over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.airdrops into Gaza graphicIsrael has condemned the international censure of its actions in Gaza and moves to recognise the Palestinian state, which it says are in service of Hamas.The past week, however, has brought the sharpest rebukes of Israel from the international community since the war in Gaza began on 7 October 2023. It has put more pressure on Israel to reach a ceasefire in Gaza or face more international isolation.Last week, ceasefire talks seemed to completely stall after Israel and the US withdrew their negotiators from Doha, where talks were being held. Both parties blamed Hamas for the collapse, saying the group had introduced new demands late in the talks – a claim Hamas denied.Israeli officials have warned that if Hamas does not become more flexible with its demands, Israel will reimpose a tight siege on humanitarian aid into Gaza, according to the country’s public broadcaster, Kan. The broadcaster said that the military proposed expanding its ground operations in the territory to put pressure on Hamas to make concessions in negotiations.Israel launched its war in Gaza after the Hamas-led attack in 2023 that killed about 1,200 people. More than 60,000 people have been killed in Gaza during Israel’s military operation and much of the territory has been destroyed.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

The majority of migrants arriving in the UK will have engaged with smugglers in this way.”The NCA has taken action against organised crime groups using social media to promote crossings, including a south Wales-based gang convicted in November 2024 after smuggling thousands of people across Europe.The gang used social media videos posted by people who had made successful crossings to promote the service.Another networkoperated bythe Preston-based smuggler Amanj Hasan Zada, who was later jailed for 17 years, also posted videos of people thanking Zada for helping them.There have been cases of Albanian people smugglers who have used social media to promote £12,000 “package deals” to get to the UK including accommodation and employment, which will also fall under the scope of the new law.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumCrimeMigrationHome OfficeYvette CooperSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

The target has not been hit since 2015, and in May just 61% were treated on time.Nine out of 10 nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland reject pay awardRead moreIn a further sign of how difficult it will be to meet that target, the data shows that a third of the 3 million unseen patients – 1 million people – have already waited more than 18 weeks without receiving any care.It is the first time the phenomenon of “unseen patients” has emerged as part of the huge challenge facing the government in its drive to “get the NHS back on its feet”. Until now debate around the NHS backlog has focused on the number of treatments patients are due to receive and how many are waiting – currently 7.36m and 6.23m respectively.“If accurate, 3 million people are trapped in an invisible waiting list crisis, stuck without basic diagnostic tests of first appointments while their conditions worsen,” said Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association.“The scale is staggering, as nearly half of all patients on a waiting list haven’t been seen by anyone. That’s not a healthcare service; that’s a breakdown.“These aren’t just statistics. They’re people checking their phones daily for hospital calls that never come, unable to plan their lives while their symptoms deteriorate.”The figures have been collated and analysed by the health data specialistMBI Health, which helps dozens of NHS trusts improve their treatment waiting times. It has shared its findings with the Guardian.Barry Mulholland, the firm’s founder and a former NHS manager, said the health service should see the waiting list as “a frontlog, not a backlog”, because so many people had not had their “first clinical contact” after joining it. In recent years ministers and NHS bosses have made reducing the number of people waiting 12 or 18 months for care their priority.“There are so many people who have already waited so long without seeing anyone – 3 million unseen patients who haven’t had their first contact.“Unless that’s dealt with, you will never achieve that target of seeing and treating patients within 18 weeks.“From the government’s point of view, the pledge to get back to 18 weeks by 2029 will be really hard to accomplish if this huge group of patients isn’t seen more quickly.”“We’ll never clear the waiting list if we don’t fix the point where patients enter the system, and long delays begin,” he added.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer has pledged that 92% of patients will be treated within 18 weeks of referral by 2029, and in May just 61% were treated on time.Photograph: Toby Melville/PA MediaNHS England acknowledged the vast number of people who had had no NHS care since joining the waiting list. Of the 7.3m treatments patients were waiting for, 4.7m – nearly two-thirds (64%) – were for people who had not had a first consultation with a specialist or a diagnostic test yet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Behind every one of these numbers is a person in pain, anxious about their health, and desperately waiting for their first contact from a clinician.“This isn’t a problem that appeared overnight; it’s the direct result of the Conservative party mismanaging our NHS for years. It is unacceptable that millions of people are still being left in a state of limbo, while their conditions potentially worsen.”Ministers would only “fix” the NHS if they overhauled social care to unblock jammed-up hospitals, she added.MBI’s analysis also found that the medical specialities with the largest number of unseen patients were ear, nose and throat care, orthopaedics, eye care, gastroenterology and gynaecology. Between 67% and 75% of those waiting lists are made up of such patients, Mulholland added.The Department ofHealthand Social Care did not comment on the 3 million unseen patients.A spokesperson said only that: “Thanks to this government’s record investment, reforms and the hard work of NHS staff, we’ve cut the waiting list by over 260,000 since July 2024, which also fell for the first time in 17 years in April and May outside the pandemic. On top of this, we have also delivered 4.6m appointments – more than double the 2m we promised.“This government is delivering the fundamental reform needed to turn our NHS around, and our 10-year health plan will build on this progress, to ensure we meet our target that 92% of patients wait no longer than 18 weeks for treatment by March 2029.”Mulholland concluded: “If we refocus on access to the first contact for those patients in limbo – and ensure high-quality data is captured – we can turn the tide, bringing down the elective list and improving the experience of people waiting for treatment.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthLabourEnglandHealth policyPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

The charges relate to three children at the rural camp in the village of Stathern, Leicestershire police said on Friday.Police launched an investigation after children attending the camp at Stathern Lodge, near Melton, became unwell.Emergency services attended the scene and eight children, all boys aged between eight and 11, along with one adult, were taken to hospital as a precaution. All of the patients have subsequently been discharged.Ruben has been remanded into custody and will appear at Leicester magistrates court on Saturday.Janine McKinney, chief crown prosecutor for CPS East Midlands, said: “The Crown Prosecution Service has authorised the prosecution of a 76-year-old man with child cruelty offences following a police investigation into a summer camp held at Stathern Lodge, Leicestershire.“This decision has been made after reviewing a file of evidence from Leicestershire police.“Jonathon Ruben will be charged with three offences of wilful ill treatment of a child relating to three boys. He will appear at Leicester magistrates court on Saturday 2 August.“This has been an extremely upsetting and shocking moment for the community, and especially for the children and parents most directly affected.“We would like to remind all concerned that there are now active criminal proceedings against Mr Ruben and he has the right to a fair trial. There must be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online that may in any way prejudice these proceedings.”Leicestershire police had originally said the incident happened on Monday, before amending it to Sunday, and it remains unclear whether officers only responded on Monday and whether that is why the force has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).The force said in a statement: “The owners and operators of Stathern Lodge are independent from those people who use or hire the lodge and are not connected to the incident.”The investigation is being led by the East Midlands special operations unit’s major incident team.DI Neil Holden, the senior investigating officer, said: “We understand the concern this incident will have caused to parents, guardians and the surrounding community.”He added: “This is a complex and sensitive investigation and we will continue to provide updates to both parents and guardians and the public as and when we can.”The IOPC said: “Our assessment team has examined all available evidence and concluded the matter should be independently investigated by the IOPC.“The investigation will look at whether there were any breaches of professional behaviour – namely a failure to carry out duties and responsibilities – that resulted in a delay in Leicestershire police’s response to what was later declared a critical incident.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In the interests of the public, Staffordshire police and the chief constable himself, I have decided to suspend Mr Noble from his role pending the outcome of the IOPC’s investigation.“Suspension is a neutral act, to enable an independent and thorough investigation to take place. It has no bearing on any indication of guilt and should not be seen as such.”Adams added: “I know that this announcement will come as a shock to many across Staffordshire, especially our hard-working officers and staff, but it is right that allegations of this serious nature are dealt with consistently and investigated properly and thoroughly.”The commissioner said his team was working to identify a temporary chief constable.In a statement, an IOPC spokesperson said: “We received mandatory referrals from Staffordshire’s office of the police, fire and crime commissioner on 30 April, 27 June and 29 July this year in relation to Staffordshire police chief constable Chris Noble.“The referrals relate to reports we’ve received raising serious concerns over Mr Noble’s behaviour outside of his work duties. The matters predate Mr Noble’s appointment as chief constable for Staffordshire police.“The IOPC is also separately investigating Mr Noble over allegations he shared confidential information without proper policing purpose. That followed a referral in 2024 from the office of the police, fire and crime commissioner for Staffordshire.

He also retweeted a petition calling for repeal of the act that has garnered more than 450,000 signatures.X has been forced toage-restrict some contentas a consequence, with the Reform UK party adding to the furore by pledging to repeal the act. Reform’s commitment prompted the UK technology secretary, Peter Kyle, toaccuse Nigel Farageof siding with the paedophile Jimmy Savile, a comment Farage described as “below the belt” and deserving of an apology.Referring to Ofcom, X said regulators had taken a “heavy-handed approach” to enforcing the act by “rapidly increasing enforcement resources” and “adding layers of bureaucratic oversight”.The statement said: “The act’s laudable intentions are at risk of being overshadowed by the breadth of its regulatory reach. Without a more balanced, collaborative approach, free speech will suffer.”X said it was compliant with the act but the threat of enforcement and fines – which in the case of social media platforms such as X could be as high as 10% of global turnover – could encourage censorship of legitimate content in order to avoid punishment.The statement also mentioned plans to create anational internet intelligence investigations teamto monitor social media for signs of anti-migrant disorder. X said the proposal may be positioned as a safety measures but “it clearly goes far beyond that intent”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A balanced approach is the only way to protect individual liberties, encourage innovation and safeguard children.”A spokesperson for Ofcom said the OSA contained clauses protecting freedom of speech.They said: “The new rules require tech firms to tackle criminal content and prevent children from seeing defined types of material that’s harmful to them. There is no requirement on them to restrict legal content for adult users.”A UK government spokespersonsaid companies faced fines under the act for failing to protect freedom of expression as well as for allowing children to view harmful content.They said: “It is demonstrably false that the Online Safety Act compromises free speech. As well as legal duties to keep children safe, the very same law places clear and unequivocal duties on platforms to protect freedom of expression. Failure to meet either obligation can lead to severe penalties.”Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyXElon MuskLabourBloggingInternetOfcomnewsShareReuse this content"

A trial judge had dismissed the case in December 2023. X’s lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk was not a defendant.One plaintiff, John Doe 1, said he was 13 when he and a friend, John Doe 2, were lured, on Snapchat, into providing nude photos of themselves to someone John Doe 1 thought was a 16-year-old girl at his school.The Snapchat user was actually a child abuse images trafficker who blackmailed the plaintiffs into providing additional photos. Those images were later compiled into a video that was posted on Twitter.According to court papers, Twitter took nine days after learning about the content to take it down and report it to NCMEC, following more than 167,000 views, court papers showed.Circuit judge Danielle Forrest said section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from liability over user content, did not shield X from the negligence claim once it learned about the images.“The facts alleged here, coupled with the statutory ‘actual knowledge’ requirement, separates the duty to report child pornography to NCMEC from Twitter’s role as a publisher,” she wrote for a three-judge panel.X must also face a claim its infrastructure made it too difficult to report child abuse images.It was found immune from claims it knowingly benefited from sex trafficking, and created search features that “amplify” child abuse images posts.Dani Pinter, a lawyer at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, which represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement: “We look forward to discovery and ultimately trial against X to get justice and accountability.”Explore more on these topicsXElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

His problems illustrate how ill-prepared theTrump administrationis to meet the needs of immigration detainees with disabilities as they carry out mass deportation plans.“They don’t see you as an individual, but as someone being deported,” Taylor said. Taylor’s fiancee, Mildred Pierre, called the experience of monitoring his wellbeing during the last six months like “receiving blow after blow”.The Guardian first reported on Taylor’s case on25 April. Since then, his challenges in detention have included the screws coming out of his prosthetic legs, causing him to fall and injure his hand, and being unable to obtain new, fitted prosthetic legs at a nearby clinic as a result of them being delivered without a charger for their battery. Then, once his fiancee brought a charger, a second appointment at the clinic two months later left him without results because the clinic was not familiar with Taylor’s model of prosthetics.The immigration detention system “can’t care for anybody beyond basic medical needs”, saidAmy Zeidan, a professor of emergency medicine at Atlanta’s Emory University who has researched healthcare in the immigration detention system. The result: “mismanagement bordering on medical neglect” in cases like Taylor’s, she said.View image in fullscreenRodney Taylor.Photograph: Courtesy of DanisMeanwhile, Pierre has spent months “trying to figure out – who do I call? Who’s going to listen?”She has contacted Georgia’s senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, as well as non-profit organizations that advocate for people with disabilities and immigrants. “I am afraid for Rodney,” she wrote to Ossoff’s office on Saturday, after her fiancee had the run-in with guards.Warnock’s office said he couldn’t comment casework involving individuals. Ossoff said he couldn’t comment on an individual’s casework.On Sunday, the day after Taylor refused to enter his cell, guards handcuffed him and placed him in solitary confinement – until Tuesday, when Stewart’s assistant warden released him. During this time, he received no water to drink, and could not charge the battery in his prosthetic legs, Pierre said.Brian Todd, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, the company that owns Stewart, wrote in an email that Taylor “is being regularly monitored by facility medical staff, with all known medical issues are being addressed, and our staff continuing to accommodate his needs”.He also said that solitary confinement “does not exist” at Stewart, and that it uses “restrictive housing units”. Experts have said that conditions in CoreCivic’sRHUsare the same as solitary confinement.Taylor was brought to the US from Liberia by his mother on a medical visa when he was a small child. He went through 16 operations. He has two fingers on his right hand. Now 46, he has lived in the US nearly his entire life, works as a barber, is active in promoting cancer awareness in his community and got engaged only 10 days before Ice detained him in January.Despite having a pending application for US residence – commonly known as a “green card” – Ice detained and locked up Taylor in January due to a burglary conviction he received as a teenager and for which the state of Georgia pardoned him in 2010, according to his attorney, who shared paperwork from his case with the Guardian.When he was detained, Taylor was only days away from being fitted for new prosthetics. Requests to Stewart to make an appointment for him to follow through on this appeared to be falling on deaf ears for four months. Then, after the Guardian’s story in April, Taylor received a visit from the warden. An appointment was made for late May.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nonetheless, when guards took him, shackled, to the rural clinic on 23 May, no one from Stewart or the clinic had ensured that the battery would be charged.Not only that, when he returned in late July, the clinic could not calibrate the legs to his body, since staff was unfamiliar with his model of prosthetics. Using the new prosthetics for months without them being calibrated means he suffers severe pain in his left knee, Taylor told the Guardian.Also in recent months, the Guardian’s and other reporting brought visits from Warnock’s staff and theGeorgia Advocacy Office,part of a national network of congressionally authorized non-profit organizations defending the rights of people with disabilities.But when Warnock’s staff met with Taylor, the warden stood outside the door watching through a glass window, and cut the visit short after 15 minutes, Taylor said. “I only had time to answer two or three questions on a list,” he said.One thing that helps Taylor keep his spirits up is the relationships he’s made with fellow detainees. When he was in solitary confinement, several guards went to enter his cell, only to be blocked by a group of detainees. They said, ‘How could y’all do that to him? He’s a good guy,” according to Pierre.Meanwhile, despite the challenges, Taylor is trying his best to stay healthy, avoid any accidents and remain hopeful about his 12 August hearing before an immigration judge, which may result in a decision on whether the US deports him.“I gotta make sure I can be able to walk when I get out of here,” he said.This article was amended on 1 August 2025 to clarify it was not Rodney Taylor’s cell, but the area outside it, that was flooded.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationSolitary confinementUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the US’s second mass murder since Monday, when a manattackeda New York City skyscraper housing the National Football League’s headquarters and shot four people dead before dying by suicide.Friday’s mass murder inMontanahappened at about 10.30am at the Owl Bar in Anaconda, according to the state’s division of criminal investigation. The agency, which is leading the investigation into the shooting, confirmed four people were pronounced dead at the scene.The suspect, who was identified as 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, lived nextdoor to the bar, according to public records. Authorities said a tactical team cleared Brown’s home and that he was last seen in the Stump Town area just west of Anaconda.More than a dozen officers from local and state police converged on that area, locking it down so no one was allowed in or out. A helicopter also hovered over a nearby mountainside as officers moved among the trees, Randy Clark – a retired police officer who lives there – told the Associated Press.Brown was believed to be armed, the Montana highway patrol said in a statement.As reports of the shooting spread through town, business owners locked their doors and sheltered inside with customers. At Caterpillars to Butterflies Childcare, a nursery a few blocks from the shooting scene, owner Sage Huot said she had kept the children inside all day after someone called to let her know about the violence.“We’re constantly doing practice drills, fire drills and active shooter drills, so we locked down the facility, locked the doors, and we have a quiet spot where we play activities away from all of our windows and doors,” Huot said.Anaconda is about 75 miles (120km) south-east of Missoula. A town of about 9,000 people in a valley hemmed in by mountains, it was founded by copper barons who profited off nearby mines in the late 1800s.A defunct smelter stack looms over the valley.The owner of the Firefly Cafe in Anaconda said she locked up her business at about 11am on Friday after being alerted to the shooting by a friend.“We are Montana, so guns are not new to us,” cafe owner Barbie Nelson said. “For our town to be locked down, everybody’s pretty rattled.”Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsMontanaUS crimeGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The unemployment rate rose to 4.2% from 4.1% in June.The Bureau of Labor also slashed the number of jobs added in recent months. May’s jobs figure was revised down by 125,000, from 144,000 to 19,000, and June was revised down by 133,000, from 147,000 to 14,000 – a combined 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.Jobs report chartHours after the data was released, Trump announced that he wasfiring the federal government officialin charge of labor statistics, claiming, without evidence, that Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of labor statistics, had “faked” employment figures ahead of last year’s election.Healthcare and social assistance added 73,300 jobs over the month but growth was dragged down by more cuts to federal workers. Twelve thousand federal jobs were lost in July and federal employment is down by 84,000 since reaching a peak in January.“There was little to celebrate in the July Employment Report,” Thomas Ryan, North America economist for CapitalEconomics, wrote in a note to investors. He noted that the three-month average employment gain had now fallen to “a troublingly low 35,000 – a figure that is difficult to interpret as anything other than a sign of hiring stalling, even as population growth slows.”Shortly before the latest official jobs data was published, two Federal Reserve policymakers whobroke ranks with its other officials on interest rates earlier this weekreleased statements explaining their respective decisions.The labor market “has become less dynamic and shows increasing signs of fragility”, said Michelle W Bowman, Fed vice-chair for supervision and a Trump appointee. Putting off a rate cut “could result in a deterioration in the labor market and a further slowing in economic growth”, she added.Christopher Waller, another Trump appointee, said waiting before cutting rates was “overly cautious”, adding: “I see no reason that we should hold the policy rate at its current level and risk a sudden decline in the labor market.”Trump, who has lambasted the Fed for months after it repeatedly opted to hold rates steady, welcomed the pair’s official interventions – and called on the central bank’s board to “assume control” of policy if Jerome Powell, the central bank’s chair, refuses to cut rates.The full list of Trump’s tariffs – from India to TaiwanRead moreThe jobs report comes in a week packed with economic news. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that gross domestic product, a broad measure of the US’s economic health,grew at 3%in the last three months, up from a 0.5% decline in the first quarter.The first quarter fall and second quarter bounceback were driven byTrump’s tariffpolicies as businesses stocked up on imports ahead of the levies at the start of the year – which cut growth – and cut back on imports in the second – which boosted growth.Taken together, theUS economygrew at a sluggish 1.2% in the first six months of the year, down from the 2.5% average pace in 2024.Also on Wednesday, theFederal Reserveannounced it wouldnot cut interest rates.The Fed is underintense pressurefrom Trump to cut rates but its chair said the central bank was still waiting to see what impact Trump’s tariffs will have on prices.“Higher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of some goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remain to be seen,” Powell said.Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment dataEconomicsTrump tariffsUS interest ratesDonald TrumpTrump administrationTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

They have also raised fears of inflation in the US.Rates were set at 25% for India’s US-bound exports, 20% for Taiwan and 30% for South Africa. Switzerland faces a rate of 39%. The deadline for a tariff deal with Mexico was extended by another 90 days.Stock markets fell on both sides of the Atlantic, after earlier falls in Asia, amid investors fears about the impact on the global economy. Europe’s Stoxx 600 was down nearly 2% while the UK’s FTSE 100 was down 0.8%. Wall Street closed lower, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 down over 1% and Nasdaq down more than 2%. The sell-off was exacerbated byweaker than expected jobs figuresin the US.Switzerland and chip powerhouse Taiwan are scrambling to negotiate deals after being hit by rates of 39% – one of the highest in the world – and 20% respectively.Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, said his government was “disappointed” by Trump’s decision to increase US tariffs on Canadian goods from 25% to 35% with immediate effect – on the grounds Canada had failed to crack down on fentanyl and to increase border security.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said he would use the week to “negotiate as strongly and as hard as we can” to reduce a crippling 30% duty on goods.Some of the world’s poorest and struggling countries were hit with punitive rates, including Syria, which faces a levy of 41%. Laos and Myanmar were hammered with rates of 40%; Libya, 30%; Iraq, 35% and Sri Lanka 20%.Would-be EU member states were blindsided by punitive rates: Moldova 25%, Serbia 35% and Bosnia and Herzogovina30%.There was some reprieve for Lesotho, a country that Trump described a state that “nobody has ever heard of” when halting USAid. It was facing 50% tariffs, an existential threat to its textile industry but came out on Friday with a 15% rate.Lesotho’s$2bn economy is heavily dependent on duty-free exports to the US. The tiny African country declared a national state of disaster after the 50% rate was declared.The Swiss franc touched its weakest in six weeks after being hit with one of the highest tariffs in the world, 39%, while the Canadian dollar was set for a seventh straight weekly loss.Karin Keller-Sutter, the Swiss president, who was celebrating the country’s national day, said she had spoken to Trump on Thursday but that “no agreement could be reached”.Pharma accounts for 50% of Swiss exports to the US, which may have been Trump’s target.Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said Switzerland got the rough end of Trump’s trade war. “The Swiss rate was a shock, and the Swiss government have said that they plan to keep negotiating with the US to secure a lower levy. Chocolatiers, watchmakers and pharma companies are all under threat,” she said.Conspicuous as the only two trading partners listed at a 10% rate were the UK, the first to get a deal with Trump, and the Falkland Islands.The EU’s 15% tariff rate as a single all-inclusive rate was confirmed in the executive order.In a setback to the EU, cars were left out in the executive order. They are currently being taxed at 27.5%, with many EU car companies resuming deliveries to customers in the US after last Sunday’s deal with Trump.The new specific rates will apply seven days after the date of the executive order, starting on 8 August. For goods already in transit or warehoused for consumption before 8 August, the previous tariff rate (10% + MFN rate) will apply until 5 October 2025.Pharmaceuticals were conspicuous by their absence, given the White House said it had agreed a 15% rate on Monday, hours after Trump sealed the deal with the EU at his Scottish golf course.Pharma chiefs, who have been in Trump’s crosshairs for months, were warned to reduce their prices to US patients by the US president. If they refused to, the federal government would “deploy every tool” in its arsenal to protect American families, the White House said.Brazil’s tariff rate was set at 10%, but a previous order placed a 40% tariff on topunish the country for prosecuting its former president, Jair Bolsonaro.Cambodia appeared to be close to reaching a deal after it said it would drop all tariffs on imports from the US and order up to 20 Boeing 737s.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsInternational tradeGlobal economyTariffsEconomicsDonald TrumpMarket turmoilnewsShareReuse this content"

Nearly half, 49%, said the Trump administration had had a negative impact on their finances. Nearly eight out of 10 Americans, including 70% of Republicans, fear that Trump’s tariffs will increase the price of everyday goods.“Donald Trump has simultaneously raised prices on everyday goods through a reckless approach to tariffs, a decimation of programs that help Americans afford healthcare, education, food and childcare, and then kneecapping federal regulators who keep banks and other big businesses from swindling consumers,” said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of the Century Foundation.“This has created an alarming set of market conditions. Americans are left on their own to face high prices and low earnings, are building their own safety nets from a web of financial products, credit cards, buy now, pay later loans, payday loans and student debt, and companies have been given the green light to manipulate these products to boost their own profits without having to worry about following the law.”According to the poll, more than six out of 10 Americans said it had become more difficult to find a good paying job, buy a home and afford childcare.More than four out of five Americans, 83%, said they were concerned about the cost of groceries, with 46% saying they were very concerned. Some 47% said they were worried about being able to pay their rent or mortgage, 64% said they were worried about affording an unexpected medical expense.About 48% said they believed they would have trouble affording an unexpected $500 bill without borrowing. One in four said it would be “very difficult”.A quarter of those surveyed said they spent at least three hours a day worrying about their finances and ability to afford basic necessities. Another 25% of respondents said they or someone in their household had skipped meals in the past year in order to make ends meet, and 26% said they had fallen behind on their monthly bills over the past year.Americans also fear things are getting worse economically, with 76% of those polled saying they fear a looming economic recession.Corporations and billionaires were seen as a big factor behind this financial anxiety, with 51% saying they believe corporations have had an active role in making life more difficult for average people over the past 25 years, and 52% saying billionaires have made life tougher.Half of those polled also believe congressional Republicans have made life more difficult, with 41% believing Democrats have made life more difficult.“Millions of Americans, across parties, across backgrounds, are deeply anxious, and they’re struggling to afford basics like housing and health care. Donald Trump is making these struggles worse,” said Rachel West, senior fellow at the Century Foundation.“Americans believe the outsized influence of corporations and the wealthy has made their lives harder, and the risks they’re taking to cope with high costs like taking on debt and tapping into their savings should sound an alarm for policymakers.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Low-income workers who rely on the aid are braced for dire consequences.Katie Giede, a single mother and waitress in Conyers, Georgia, is one of the 42 million Americans who use the supplemental nutrition assistance program (Snap). Even with the maximum benefit permitted, she struggles to afford food for her and her child.She makes $3 an hour plus tips at the fast-food chain Waffle House, where she has worked for 11 years. The companydeductsmeals from workers’ pay check per shift, regardless of whether they eat one or not.“Our pay is already so little that we’re struggling with everything,” Giede told the Guardian. “Single mothers like myself are reliant upon the benefits like Snap and Medicaid. So when you go and you cut that as well, now you have mothers out here that are not only worried at night because they already can’t afford housing or a vehicle, but we’re also worried what is our kid is going to eat? Because we no longer have help.”Giede said she received $450 a month for her and her child. She said working too many hours or receiving too much incomewas a constant concern,due toeligibilitycut-offs.According to ananalysisby the Urban Institute, at the end of 2024, even the maximum Snap benefit would not cover the cost of a modestly priced meal in 99% of all counties in the US.“I dread that trip to the grocery store every week, because you have to sit down and you really have to budget,” said Giede. “Every time you go, you’re having to make the choice between something that’s healthy or something that’s cheaper, just so you can get enough to last all week.View image in fullscreenKatie Giede, Waffle House worker, in Atlanta.Photograph: Courtesy of USSW“There are so many people in this country that rely on these benefits, and with these cuts, half of the people that are surviving right now off of this are going to lose their benefits. That’s not even just people not eating a little bit. They’re already not eating enough, so we’re going to lose lives over this. It’s those of us at the bottom that are really feeling it.”Waffle House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” set the stage for significant cuts to Snap by shifting higher administrative costs to each state, expanding work reporting requirements and imposing restrictions on non-citizen eligibility.Many lower-wage workers have grown more reliant on Snap in recent years. US food prices rose by 23.6% between 2020 and 2024, according to official data. While inflation has since moderated, grocery costs remain high.‘It’s been a lifesaver’: millions risk going hungry as Republicans propose slashing food stampsRead moreAs a result of the latest Snap changes,states will be responsible for 75% of administrative costs of handling the program from 2027, up from 50% cost-sharing with the federal government, which is likely to strain state budgets.From 2028, for the first time states will be forced to pick up some of the multibillion-dollar bill for Snap benefits. The state of New York, for example, faces a budget impact of about $1.2bn, according to theFoodResearch and Action Center (Frac), a non-profit advocacy group.While such shifting costs have raised fears that states will cut back Snap support,expanded work requirements have sparked concern that few people will be eligible.Analysisby the Urban Institute found about 22.3 million US families are set to lose some or all of their Snap benefits.“This is a very targeted, well-thought-out plan of dismantling the Snap program that federal policy makers won’t take responsibility for, because it is the states, it is the governors who will have to cut resources for Snap, who will have to cut the program in order to say we can’t operate this because of what’s happening at the federal level,”said Gina Plata-Nino, Snap deputy director at the Frac.“Snap is a very important ecosystem at the local level, at the state level and the federal level, because billions of dollars go into states, and this federal money supports local economies,” she added. “All of these proposals threaten this very delicate balance.”The White House deferred comment to the office of management and budget, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment.States across the US are braced for stark consequences.“We’re going to have worse hunger and ultimately, worse poverty,” said Seth DiStefano, policy outreach director at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. “There are entire regions of West Virginia where there aren’t 20 hours a week [expanded Snap work requirement] of anything to apply for. What do you tell those families?“We’re talking families with kids now that are going to be subjected to these harsh work reporting requirements. We’re talking folks in their 60s, literally in communities where there are no jobs, none, and ripping away the one outlet to their basic needs that’s available to them.”Among the employers with the most workers reliant on Snap is Walmart, the largest private employer in the US, as much of its workforcereceivesonly part-time hours.Christina Gahagan, 66, has worked at Walmart for a decadein western New York at several stores. She is currently based at a store in Geneseo, New York.“I would say at least 50% of the people in my store rely on food stamps to make ends meet for their families,” said Gahagan. “They’re always trying to figure out where the best deals are, coupon clipping at lunch and reading circulars to see who’s got the best deal on whatever, just to make their money stretch.”She has cut down on costly grocery items, eating cheaper junk food to get by.“I was paying $9 a pound for roast beef. Today it’s almost $13 a pound. So I’m not buying full pounds any more. I’m just buying a half a pound and making it work and just eating crap in between, like buying myself some chips out of the vending machine or something,” Gahagan said.“Walmart is the largest employer in the US. We rival Amazon almost dollar for dollar in what we do. You would think a company like that could shell out a little bit more money per hour for associates in the store across the board, so that there aren’t people who are having to depend so heavily on public assistance.”Walmart did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS domestic policyFoodFood povertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite being one of Bollywood’s most bankable superstars for more than three decades, he realised that only tiny numbers of Indians were watching him on the big screen.Indian cinema is widely adored and has an outsized influence on society but just 2-3% of its 1.4 billion people go to the cinema.One longstanding problem is access, in particular in rural areas. Khan, who has starred in, directed and produced celebrated films including Lagaan, 3 Idiots and Taare Zameen Par, spent years trying to develop a plan to build thousands of low-cost cinemas in India’s rural hinterland where films could be beamed in via satellite. However, the initiative was stymied by relentless bureaucracy.Cost, too, has become a big obstacle. In the past, going to the cinema was a vibrant, often rowdy communal affair, where families would pack out single-screen cinemas amid cheering, dancing and whistling, with tickets costing just a few rupees. But as multiplexes have come to dominate in India, it has become a luxury experience. Tickets now regularly cost upwards of 500 rupees (£4.30) – unaffordable to most families in India.View image in fullscreenAamir Khan and Gracy Singh in Lagaan (Once Upon a Time in India), 2001.Photograph: AJ Pics/Alamy“When my first film came out the cinema tickets were 10 rupees and whole families from all classes could afford to come [and] pack out cinema halls,” said Khan, 60. “But the reality is that theatres are no longer a mass medium, it’s become an upper-class medium. And as film-makers, we haven’t done enough to change that and reach that other 97% of the population.”Instead, he said people had found other ways to watch films: either waiting for them to come on to satellite television or watching grainy pirated versions on their phones.This week, however, Khan presented what he promised would be the solution – or what he described as the “future for Indian cinema”. After a traditional cinematic run, his latest release, Sitaare Zameen Par (Stars on Earth), will be made available for audiences exclusively onYouTubefor just 100 rupees, the equivalent of less than £1. Other films in his back catalogue and future releases will follow.His choice of YouTube, known more as a place to watch trailers than full movies, was deliberate. Of all entertainment platforms, YouTube’s reach in India – with 491 million users – far outstretches other traditional streaming services such asNetflix, which has about 12 million subscribers in India. It was, said Khan, “an absolute no-brainer when you consider the reach it has”.“Internet penetration in India is now huge so you don’t need physical theatres to reach an audience any more,” Khan said. “I believe this is the model that will reach out to the maximum number of people and also serve the film industry’s creative community. Of course, the first place for our films should always be theatres. But then they should be available to the bulk of the country at an affordable price.”Khan said he would always prefer people to watch his films on the big screen but the reality was that theatres were not catering to the audience he wanted to reach.He said: “The idea with this is that 100 rupees would be paid by a whole family to watch the film together, maybe with their neighbours as well, so the cost per head would be very low.”View image in fullscreenAamir Khan with Gunjan Soni, the managing director of YouTube India.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPAKhan’s decision to offer an alternative is also a response to the detrimental role he believes streaming has played in the crisis being faced by Indian cinema.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the past decade, since right-wing Hindu nationalist politics have come to dominate India, film-makers have accused India’s film censors of being draconian and blocking anything politically contentious.Bollywood’s biggest male stars – Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, often referred to as the “trinity of Khans” – are all Muslim and have been targeted by nationalists, who have mobilised hate campaigns and boycotts of their films and accused them of being “anti-India”. Khan continues to be haunted by comments he made a decade ago, stating that he felt unsafe amid “rising intolerance”, which prompted protests.Khan acknowledged that many in the industry felt their creative instincts were being curbed by people in positions of strength who know very little about mass communication. “They feel they don’t have the freedom to say things the way they want to and how they want to,” he said.But Khan said censorship and other pressures faced by Indian cinema were nothing new and dated back to the 1940s. “Every society has a certain percentage of people who are negative in their outlook and that is not going to disappear.”Despite entertaining thoughts of retirement – as well as a brief period during the pandemic when he “secretly retired for six months” – Khan said he remained excited by the possibilities of cinema in India. “I’m really hopeful this new model will work,” he said. “If it doesn’t, we’re all in trouble.”Explore more on these topicsBollywoodIndiaFilm industrySouth and central AsiaYouTubeNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Guardian Australia understands the US government confirmed to the Australian embassy in Washington DC that the 10% tariff rate would remain in place.Trump imposes tariffs of 10% to 41% on dozens of countries, hours before deadlineRead more“The White House has confirmed that no country has reciprocal tariffs lower than Australia,” a spokesperson for Australia’s minister for trade, Don Farrell, said on Friday morning.Trump’s so-called “reciprocal tariffs” are separate to the industry-specific tariffs of 50% imposed by the Trump administration on Australian steel, aluminium and copper imports: those tariffs also remain in place.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“While we remain in the best possible position under the United States’ new tariff regime, we will continue to advocate for the removal of all tariffs in line with our free trade agreement,” the spokesperson said.Farrell said the US commerce secretary – and tariff hawk – Howard Lutnick, had told him there had been pressure from within the US administration for an increase on Australia’s tariff rate “but that President Trump had decided to maintain that 10%”.“I think this is a vindication for the Albanese government – and particularly the prime minister – and the cool and calm way we have conducted diplomacy with the United States.”Australia runs a trade deficit with the US, but Farrell said imposing reciprocal tariffs on US goods, as a retributive measure for the US tariffs, would have been counterproductive.Farrell said that Australia holding at 10% – while the tariffs imposed on other countries had increased – was a comparative win for Australia.“Australian products are now more competitive into the American market … products like wine, beef, lamb, wheat are, in a relative sense, cheaper into the United States.”Farrell said Australia still hoped to remove all tariffs from its imports into America, and he had invited Lutnick to Australia for further talks.“We believe in free and fair trade, and we will continue to put the argument to the US that they should remove all tariffs on Australian products in accordance with our free trade agreement, and we will continue to prosecute that argument.”Quizzed on whether the multibillion-dollar Aukus submarine deal had been a factor in the trade tariff negotiations, Farrell said Australia’s close defence relationship with the US was separate from its trade links.“We will continue to have discussions with the US about the Aukus: it will be completely independent of our trade relationship. There is no job that is more important for a federal government than our national security.”The Biden-era Aukus deal, under which Australia would buy nuclear submarines from the US, is currently being reviewed by the Pentagon, under instruction from Trump.A Commonwealth Bank of Australia report issued Friday said Australia was relatively “well-insulated” from the turbulence caused by the Trump tariffs.“We estimate Australian GDP will be just 0.3% lower over a few years because of the tariffs. Only around 5% of Australia’s exports are to the US. And Australia’s tariff rate is a relatively low 10%.”In the executive order issued this week, Trump indicated he was open to further negotiations on tariffs with countries he saw as aligned to his America First ideology.“Some trading partners have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States, thus signaling their sincere intentions to permanently remedy the trade barriers that have contributed to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, and to align with the United States on economic and national security matters.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It remains at a 30% tariff rate, with some exemptions for goods such as smartphones and semiconductors. A proposed – punitive – 145% tariff on Chinese imports has been paused until mid-August.Trump threatens Canada on trade deal after Carney moves to recognise PalestineRead moreThe US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent,told reportersthe US has the “makings of a deal” with China, but that it’s not yet complete.“There’s still a few technical details to be worked out on the Chinese side between us. I’m confident that it will be done, but it’s not 100% done.”With tariff negotiations still in play, Trump has taken aim at countries that negotiate with American drug companiesto pay lower prices for pharmaceuticals, such as Australia.Under Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the government negotiates directly with drug companies to secure comparatively low prices, a longstanding arrangement, but one which has been a consistent irritant for Trump.Australia has been consistent in its dealings with the Trump administration that “the PBS is not up for negotiation”.“Our government is getting on with the job of delivering cheaper medicines for Australians,” a government spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyDonald TrumpAustralian economyTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ipic.twitter.com/EUnEj9uRUt— Micah Parsons (@MicahhParsons11)August 1, 2025“Yes I wanted to be here. I did everything I could to show that I wanted to be a Cowboys and wear the star on my helmet,” Parsons wrote.“... Unfortunately I no longer want to be here. I no longer want to be held to close door negotiations without my agent present. I no longer want shots taken at me for getting injured while laying it on the line for the organization our fans and my teammates. I no longer want narratives created and spread to the media about me.”Commanders wideout Terry McLaurin requests trade after contract talks stallRead moreParsons said his attempts to discuss an extension started after the 2023 season but have repeatedly been met by “radio silence” from the Cowboys.“Up to today the team has not had a single conversation with my agent about a contract,” Parsons wrote. “Not one demand has been made by my agent about money, years or anything else.“Still I stayed quiet but again after repeated shots at myself and all the narratives I have made a tough decision I no longer want to play for the Dallas Cowboys. My trade request has been submitted to Stephen Jones personally.“Parsons is scheduled to earn $24m this season on his fifth-year option. The 2021NFLDefensive Rookie of the Year has recorded double-digit sacks in each of his first four seasons and has watched the market for pass rushers explode.Defensive end Myles Garrett signed a four-year, $160m extension with the Cleveland Browns. Maxx Crosby inked a three-year, $106.5m extension with the Las Vegas Raiders. TJ Watt’s extension with the Pittsburgh Steelers was for three years and $123m. A Parsons extension likely would be in the same ballpark – or more.Per the Athletic, Parsons and team owner Jerry Jones talked directly in the spring, and the Cowboys believe those conversations were negotiations with a deal for an extension in place. The Parsons’ camp instead portrayed the meetings as talks and not negotiations, and that the Cowboys have declined to negotiate with his agent because team officials believed an agreement already was in place.Speaking in April at the NFL’s annual league meeting, Jones acknowledged his conversation with Parsons, saying the two spoke for “five or six hours” to work out a long-term extension.“Most of the issues we are in agreement on. We discussed it all,” Jones said April 1. “But we obviously don’t have an agreement relative to the new contract.“The Dallas Morning News reported in March that Parsons was seeking a record- setting $200m contract extension that would make him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL.Parsons recorded 12 sacks, 43 tackles and two forced fumbles in 13 games (all starts) last season.A Pro Bowl selection in each of his first four seasons in the league, Parsons has totaled 256 tackles (63 for loss), 112 quarterback hits, 52.5 sacks, nine forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries in 63 career games (all starts).Explore more on these topicsDallas CowboysNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Though typically cagey, Emanuel hinted, “Who knows what’s going to happen with the Ali Act” – a reference to theMuhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, a federal law designed to protect the rights and welfare of boxers. Since then, rumors have swirled that TKO is quietly working to amend the law to make way for its newly minted boxing venture with Saudi Arabia.Last week, those rumors were confirmed when US representatives Brian Jack, a Republican from Georgia, and Sharice Davids, a Democrat from Kansas, introduced theMuhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Actin Congress.The proposed bill is being touted by the congressional representatives as a much-needed modernization of federal regulations in professional boxing, adding new provisions to the 1996 ProfessionalBoxingSafety Act and introducing “alternatives” to the sanctioning bodies overseeing the sport.“I am incredibly proud to introduce the bipartisan Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act, which provides boxers with more opportunities, better pay, and greater safety standards,” Jacksaid in the press release. “Professional boxing is the only sport regulated by Congress, and ambiguity in current law – adopted over a quarter-century ago – has stifled investment. Congressional action is needed to revive this once-great American sport, and this bipartisan legislation establishes a framework for innovation to flourish.”The “stifled investment” that Jack is referencing in his statement is TKO’s new boxing venture with Sela, an entertainment subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), and Turki al-Sheikh, the figure behind Saudi’s General Entertainment Authority and a close confidant of Crown PrinceMohammed bin Salman. The new venture, dubbed Zuffa Boxing, will debut on 13 September 2025, with an anticipated super middleweight showdown between Saul ‘Canelo’ Álvarez and Terence Crawford. An expanded boxing promotion will likely follow in 2026.Backed by the Saudi government’s enormous resources, Emanuel’s company advocated for the bill in Congress, including provisions to created alternatives to long-established sanctioning bodies like the World Boxing Organization (WBO) and World Boxing Council (WBC). The proposed alternatives in the legislation are known as Unified Boxing Organizations (UBOs), which is what Zuffa Boxing will likely operate as.While framed as a “framework for innovation”, Zuffa Boxing empowers Saudi Arabia to establish a parallel boxing ecosystem where it has sole determination over fighter ranking and championship belts. This paves the way for Saudi to bypass established sanctioning bodies, undermine existing promoters, and ultimately, gut professional boxing.“This is a concerning bill for professional boxers,” said Erik Magraken, a combat sports regulatory lawyer and founder ofcombatsportslaw.com. “It guts the key protections from the Ali Act for promoters that choose to use the ‘unified boxing organization’ model. It allows a promoter to control rank and title … and achieve a stranglehold on the sport.”The bill also sets out a series of compliance requirements for UBOs, including minimum per‑round payments and safety provisions such as mandatory medical examinations and expanded health insurance. While these measures could, in theory, benefit up‑and‑coming boxers, they also create significant barriers to entry for smaller boxing organizations attempting to establish UBOs. Zuffa Boxing, backed by Saudi funding, would be well‑positioned to dominate this space, attract new fighters, and establish a new hierarchy in the sport – one in which TKO effectively determines who holds the world titles.This new model for boxing is based almost entirely on the structure of theUFC, an organization that has long been criticized for its exploitation of fighters in its pursuit of profit. Fitting since UFC CEO Dana White, a longtime friend of US president Donald Trump, is expected to lead the new Zuffa Boxing venture.“Everybody knows the format – the best fight the best,” Whitesaidin interview with The Ring, the boxing magazine owned by Al-Sheikh and, by extension, the Saudi government. “You work your way up the rankings, and once somebody breaks into the top five [and] there is no question [about] who the best five guys are in each weight class, they fight it out. And once somebody holds that belt, you don’t need three letters in front of the belt. Whoever has that belt is the best in the world in that weight class. It’s a very simple model.”Despite generating billions in revenue, the UFC pays its athletes a significantly smaller share compared to other major sports leagues. While NFL and NBA players receive close to 50% of league revenues, UFC fighters earn roughly 15% to 18%, with many on the roster making as little as $10,000 to $20,000 per fight – amounts that barely cover training costs, coaching and medical expenses. Efforts to unionize or challenge these inequities have been quashed by the UFC, which has used long-term, exclusive contracts and its market dominance to keep fighters in line.Last year, the UFC agreed to a $375m settlement with several hundred fighters to resolve an antitrust lawsuit. The plaintiffs accused the promotion of stifling economic competition and using its monopoly power to suppress fighter pay. While the UFC denied any wrongdoing, the underlying claims remain central to a separate, ongoing case.When Congress passed the Ali Act in 2000, it was in response to the unfair and anti-competitive practices rampant in pro boxing at the time. The sport was dominated by influential promoters, corrupt sanctioning bodies and coercive contracts. The Ali Act provided federally-backed oversight and enforcement meant to reduce the exploitation of fighters through transparency mandates and financial disclosure requirements. The legislation passed with unanimous bipartisan support and stands as the only example of Congress attempting to directly regulate a professional sport in the United States.While the Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act does not repeal the Ali Act, it does pave the way for new organizations to emerge outside of the purview of current sanctioning bodies, effectively bringing the UFC model to boxing. It is unclear when the bill will reach the House floor, as Congress will be in recess through the entirety of August.Nevertheless, the bill has received support from Ali’s widow, Lonnie Ali, who was quoted in the press release as saying that “Muhammad would be proud to have his name associated with this bill.” Davids, who co-sponsored the bill, was also aformer MMA fighterwho once tried out as a contestant for The Ultimate Fighter – a reality show that places fighters in a mansion for several weeks as they work their way through a tournament for a “six-figure UFC contract”. Their involvement in the bill is a masterstroke of lobbying tactics by TKO and Emanuel.“The Ali Act was created to stop coercive and exploitative practices by promoters. It was designed to make a monopolization of the sport not possible. Independent rank and title are the key reasons why pro boxers can command such great purses compared to MMA athletes,” Magraken said. “Boxers compete for titles. Promoters compete for boxers. If promoters own and control titles then boxers can be exploited by promoters.”This will be remarkably beneficial to Saudi Arabia and Al-Sheikh, who have invested billions to wrest control of boxing from its traditional masters.Al-Sheikh has bankrolled some of the most high-profile heavyweight fights and broken through negotiation stalemates by offering record-breaking sums of money. His success as a promoter has made him one of the sport’s most powerful figures, while fans and media affectionately refer to him as “His Excellency” – a title that underscores his growing cult of personality.Al-Sheikh’s expanding influence has stifled criticism within boxing. Fans are willing to overlook troubling behavior as long as he continues to deliver exciting matchups, while journalists, eager to maintain their critical access, often frame the narrative in his favor. The kingdom also owns its own boxing magazine and deploys a vast network of PR firms and executives to advance its political agenda through sports.It is yet another reminder of Saudi Arabia’s broader strategy in sports – a blueprint built on acquiring influence, shaping narratives and establishing self-sustaining ecosystems under its control.Boxing may be the ideal asset to complete that vision.Karim Zidan writes aregular newsletteron the intersection of sports and authoritarian politics.Explore more on these topicsBoxingTurki al-SheikhUFCMohammed bin SalmanUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having set himself the task of returning a title for Ferrari, anticipation for his first season with the team was off the scale but success has been far from forthcoming. As the Scuderia have struggled the seven-time champion has been drawing on every bit of experience in what may be the defining challenge of his storied career.At the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend Ferrari announced they wereextending their contractwith team principal, Fred Vasseur, backing the Frenchman who was instrumental in bringing Hamilton on board to complete his mission of reforging Ferrari into a championship-winning outfit after underachieving for so long. However as the season approaches its summer break, with 10 races to come after Budapest and Ferrari winless, Vasseur still has much to achieve.Vasseur signs new long-term Ferrari contract to end Horner speculationRead moreHamilton has been outspoken in his support for Vasseur since he made the switch after 12 years with Mercedes but, during a season of acclimatisation and adaptation to a new team, the British driver has appreciated that he must do more than drive. Rather it seems, as Michael Schumacher managed to such great success withFerrari, to take a leadership role.It is believed Hamilton was somewhat taken aback at the team’s organisation and methodologies when he began working with them and that he felt the decision making process was ungainly. He has repeatedly stressed he is convinced they have the talent in personnel to succeed but it has become clear he thinks they must be utilised better.At Belgium last week he was unusually candid in revealing he had held a series of meetings with the key players at Ferrari: Vasseur, the chair John Elkann and the chief executive, Benedetto Vigna. Moreover he had gone as far as compiling two documents detailing suggestions for the progress he believes is needed to turn around Ferrari’s fortunes, an admission that caused no little stir.One of said submissions was about the car, where he thought it could be improved and more crucially where they might take it under the new regulations next year. This might be considered the due diligence of any committed, ambitious and thoughtful driver. However of more significance was the second aimed at the operational approach at Ferrari, the “structural adjustments” he believed were required.“It is a huge organisation and there’s a lot of moving parts, and not all of them are firing on all the cylinders that [they] need to be,” he said. “That’s ultimately why the team’s not had the success that I think it deserves. So I feel that it’s my job to challenge absolutely every area, to challenge everybody in the team, particularly the guys that are at the top who are making the decisions.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton walks in the paddock before the practice session at the Hungaroring.Photograph: Anna Szilágyi/EPAFor the 40-year-old Hamilton there is urgency to this task. Ferrari is surely his last shot at claiming a record-breaking eighth title that would end the team’s drought stretching back to 2007 for a drivers’ championship and 2008 for a constructors’. He is more than aware that since then the Scuderia has come close but still failed to deliver even with former world champions Fernando Alonso and then Sebastian Vettel at the wheel.Over 11 seasons between 2010 and 2020, there were many wins for Alonso and Vettel but still ultimately the team could not seal a championship. Hamilton’s actions and attitude reveal a determination that if he too is to fall short it will not be through a lack of effort on his behalf.“I refuse for that to be the case with me, so I’m going the extra mile,” he said. “I’ve obviously been very fortunate to have had experiences in two other great teams. And while things for sure are going to be different, because there’s a different culture and everything, I think sometimes if you take the same path all the time, you get the same results. So I’m just challenging certain things.”That the best use of the human resource in F1 can be gamechanging could not be better illustrated than with the extraordinary resurgence Andrea Stella has wrought at McLaren in just over two years. Moreover there are also indications that internally Hamilton is already making a difference. “The response has been amazing to the steps that we’ve taken in all areas,” he said in Hungary. “The passion and the desire to continue to do better is what’s the most amazing thing.”On track there is a sense that for all that Hamilton has struggled with the car this year, without a podium for 13 races, the longest period of his career, he remains as sharp as ever. Hisrecent drivesat Silverstone and Spa were proof enough of that and his call to switch to slick tyres in Belgium evidence that his instincts remain finely honed.Hamilton is then putting the building blocks in place, confident that if the team can deliver he will too, having already done the hard yards behind the scenes this season.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton is confident of a change of fortunes for Ferrari that could lead to a record eighth drivers’ title.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAIn first practice at the Hungaroring Hamilton and his teammate Charles Leclerc continued to work with the new rear suspension Ferrari brought to Spa and which they hope will develop into a serious improvement for the car. They finished fifth and third respectively in a session which was once more dominated by the McLarens of championship contenders Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. In the second session McLaren were once more on top, with Norris again leading Piastri by two-tenths. Leclerc was third and Hamilton sixth, with Max Verstappen in 14th, very much struggling with the balance of his ride. The Dutchman’s difficult afternoon was further compounded as he was investigated for throwing a towel, left in error in his car, from the cockpit while on track and issued with a warning for an unsafe release.Norris on Friday looked to ease the pressure on the title race, saying that it does not matter if he fails to beat Piastri to the world championship because “in 200 years we will all be dead”.Asked if he needs to get under the Australian’s skin to land his maiden F1 title, Norris replied: “I don’t enjoy that. In 200 years no one is going to care. We’ll all be dead. I am trying to have a good time. I still care about it, and that’s why I get upset sometimes and I get disappointed and angry at myself. And I think that shows just how much I care about winning and losing.“But that doesn’t mean I need to take it out on Oscar. I just don’t get into those kind of things.”Explore more on these topicsLewis HamiltonFerrariFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And he came back and said he would cost us around £4m, but he was very good. So I told the people at Crystal Palace.”Warnock resists identifying Steve Parish, Palace’s chairman, by name for he is deep in a story that illustrates how data analytics is not always infallible. “He asked for 24 hours and went to the data people. The next day he said: ‘We don’t want to go ahead.’ I asked him why and he said they don’t think he’s quick enough. I said: ‘He might not look quick enough, but he’s in second gear in Scotland. If he had to sprint, he’d sprint.’”I already know Warnock is remembering how he missed signing Virgil van Dijk and, as we’re having an enjoyable knockabout, I ask if even a great player such as Franz Beckenbauer might have been dismissed by the stats men. The German sweeper had pace and tenacity, but his regal vision meant he could intercept a pass without needing to produce a crunching tackle. “Correct,” Warnock replies. “Beckenbauer would never have got on, would he, with the data? He’d have been playing Sunday league, Beckenbauer.“So we didn’t sign Van Dijk. He went to Southampton [for £13m]. I was with Cardiff a few years later, when we got to the Premier League, andI came up against him at Liverpool[who signed Van Dijk for £75m]. He came up and said: ‘Mr Warnock, you could have signed me’. I swore and said: ‘I bet you were glad that you were too slow for me.’ We had a laugh together.”“It just shows you. They can sign these great players on a computer but I was at Middlesbrough and they said they’d got a left-back for me,” Warnock goes on. “I watched him for five minutes and said: ‘He can’t defend. I don’t want him.’ They said: ‘But his stats show he’s got the most tackles, the most headers.’ I said: ‘Are you listening? He can’t defend.’ Managers now are more or less coaches and they’re letting the recruitment team pick the players. But the data people don’t see the character of the person or other aspects of his game.”View image in fullscreenWarnock photographed for the Guardian when manager at QPR in 2011. ‘I got Cardiff in the Premier League. Look where they are now.’Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianA freewheeling conversation with Warnock moves from memories of drinking pink champagne with Brian Clough to a bitter fallout with Sir Alex Ferguson. It includes recollections of eight promotions, five relegations, and a lot of pride. “I survived 1,627 games,” Warnock says. “When I started [at Gainsborough Town in 1980] I just wanted to survive a season. Let alone 45 years as a manager. Fucking hell. Frightening, isn’t it?”Warnock’s managerial career ended in March last year.He resigned after Aberdeen beat Kilmarnock 3-1to reach the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup and, while he won’t discuss the reasons for his abrupt departure from Pittodrie after eight games, Warnock didn’t like off-field interference in his work. He is now apart-time consultant at Torquay Unitedand hopes to help the club return to the Football League. But, in a sign of his diluted focus, the 76-year-old’s attention is also on his upcoming tour, when he willappear at the London Palladium.Warnock sounds suitably gobsmacked in his unvarnished Sheffield accent. “When I was a kid, my mum had multiple sclerosis and my dad worked in the steelworks. But on a Sunday night I used to sit in front of my mum in her wheelchair and she played with my hair while as a family we watched Sunday Night at the London Palladium. So when these shows were being discussed I just said: ‘I’d love to do the Palladium.’ I didn’t suppose we could, but I’ll be thinking so much of my mum and dad.“In those days your dad never told you he loved you. It was macho. But he was a crane driver in the steelworks and after his 16-hour shifts he would come home to a wife with multiple sclerosis and three kids in a two-bedroom semi. You don’t appreciate what he must have gone through until years later.”Warnock’s distinctly human stories prompted Pep Guardiola to invite him into the Manchester City dressing room. Towards the end of last season Warnock spoke to a group of multimillionaire footballers, including Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland, and he grins now.“The first thing I said is: ‘I bet you lot think yourselves lucky you’ve not got me as your manager, because you’d be kicking the ball from there to there and it wouldn’t be on the ground.’ They all creased up. I said a few other things that made them laugh. Afterwards Pep said he’d enjoyed it so much and that you don’t get that now in football – the humour. He said: ‘Everything’s so methodical, so data-driven, blah-blah-blah.’ He said we miss that human element.”View image in fullscreenA young Sheffield United supporter makes his feelings clear before Christmas in 2023.Photograph: PA Wire/PAWarnockinterviewed Guardiola for Sky Sportsand, despite their mutual affection, there is an amusing clash of philosophies. Guardiola cackled through much of the interview but he looked almost bewildered when Warnock said: “We love man-marking.” After Guardiola said “You love, huh? Why?” Warnock explained that, as his teams were technically inferior, they had to try and nullify the opposition. “And the players,” Guardiola asked, “they support it? They like it?” Warnock’s immediate reaction – “well, they had to” – makes Guardiola smile again. As Warnock tells me now, “I never had a good team but I always had a good dressing room.”Warnock was old school. “When I were manager at Palace,” he says, “Man City brought down two buses full of staff. I thought: ‘Bloody hell, I’ve never seen ’owt like it.’ I got our kit man to chuck a bucket of cold water on the floor in their dressing room to make it scruffy as possible.”But there were occasions when Warnock was helpless. “At Cardiff we played City [in 2018] and had a couple of shots. It was 0-0 after 30 minutes and I’m thinking: ‘we’re doing well here’. Then we went in at half-time 2-0 down and after Bernardo Silva scored the second I’m saying out loud on the bench: ‘What a goal. That’s unbelievable.’ And I’m the opposition manager!”Cardiff lost 5-0and were relegated that season when acontroversial 2-1 defeat by Chelseahastened their demise in May 2019.“It’s a lonely job, being a manager,” Warnock says. “I felt very lonely at times and probably the loneliest was at Cardiff when Chelsea got a goal that should have been disallowed for three yards offside. I knew that would relegate us. The dressing room was desolate because the lads had given me absolutely everything. I can tell you now the linesman was Ed Smart and Craig Pawson refereeing. I can see it as if it were yesterday. I’ll be looking at that on my grave.“I told the referee and linesman: ‘I wish you could come in my dressing room and see the desolation because you didn’t do your jobs right.’ We didn’t deserve to go down that year.”Warnock was fined £20,000 for complaining about the officiating but now his attention reverts to Guardiola. “I noticed how much he was having to bite his tongue when you looked at the goals City conceded towards the end of last season. It wasn’t anything tactical. They were just bad mistakes. I knew it hurt him but he’s got the bit between his teeth again now. I’m going to be interested in seeing how they go this season because they’ll be a threat. Liverpool have spent all that money and Arsenal are spending as well, but Pep’s signed two or three good players. He’s the best manager since I’ve been around and I think he’ll prove it again.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Oh my God, his intelligence.” Warnock and Wenger also had an unlikely bromance. “He liked me and he respected me. It was said that Wenger never had any managers in his office after a game but he always invited me. On one occasion I even took my kids in and we had a picture in his office.” He frowns when I suggest it’s strange Ferguson has not been added to his top three. “I’d have to put Fergie in,” he says grudgingly. “But I’d have Pep and Arsène before him.”View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola and then Cardiff manager Neil Warnock at their 2018 FA Cup meeting.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAWarnock once spoke warmly of Ferguson and how the Scot would write to him encouragingly after every promotion and relegation. But his attitude has hardened now. “I don’t really want to talk about him because I’ve not got anything good to say.” Is that because Ferguson played a weakened Manchester United side against West Ham in the final game of the season in 2007? “Absolutely. Unforgivable, in my eyes. Same with [Liverpool’s] Rafa Benítez. He played the kids at Fulham that same year.”The pain for Warnock was intensified because Sheffield United, his boyhood team,were relegatedafter they lost at home to Wigan and West Ham stayed up after beating United by a solitary goal scored by Carlos Tevez, whose registration was thought to be ineligible by Warnock and many others. Has he spoken to Ferguson since that disastrous day? “No,” Warnock says with icy finality.He is happier discussing another managerial icon in Clough. “I was at Notts County [between 1989 and 1993] and Cloughie used to walk past our little training ground to get to their 10 acres where they had a fantastic training facility. He would be with [Clough’s assistant at Nottingham Forest] Alan Hill and a black labrador. Cloughie would walk across my pitch. He never walked around it and nobody said ’owt. He looked round at what we were doing, shook his head and walked on. Brilliant!”Warnock laughs before becoming more serious again. “We drew 1-1 at their place and at one of our lunches, he said: ‘You don’t realise, son, but it’s a remarkable job for a club like Notts County to be competing with us in the top division. It’ll never happen again, what you’ve done.’ And of course Notts County went from the old First Division to non-league football.View image in fullscreen‘When I was at Notts County, Cloughie would walk across my pitch.

Look where they are now. To get Notts County in the top flight? If I had a fashionable name or I were a fashionable manager, I think I’d have got more acknowledgment. But they gave me an award this year at the Football League, for my contribution to the EFL.”Warnock sinks back in his chair and smiles: “I thought: ‘Bloody hell. It’s about time!’”Neil Warnock: Are You With Me? is at Opera House, Manchester on 29 August, London Palladium on 18 September and Ashton Gate Stadium, Bristol on 28 September.

Newcastle value their prized asset at £150m, a British transfer-record sum, but are reluctant to sell the 25-year-old, who was the second highest goalscorer in the Premier League last season behind Mohamed Salah.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreGiven how swiftly Newcastle rejected their offer, Liverpool consider it futile to return with a second bid before the transfer window closes on 1 September. Their offer of £110m for the want-away player remains on the table.Liverpool were encouraged to step up their pursuit by Isak’s stance following Hughes’ enquiry and the player’s representatives. The club have spent almost £300m so far this summer, including a£79m deal to sign Newcastle target Hugo Ekitiké. But with £190m recouped in sales since Hughes arrived in June 2024, plus healthy revenues from their title triumph and return to the Champions League, Liverpool are in a position to test Newcastle’s resolve to keep Isak. Their current transfer record isthe £100m paid to Bayer Leverkusen for Florian Wirtz in June. That could rise to a British transfer record of £116m with add-ons.Isak did not travel on Newcastle’s pre-season tour of Asia. The club attributed his absence to a minor thigh injury but the player informed them that he wishes to explore his options this summer, with Liverpool his preferred destination, and has been training at former club Real Sociedad this week. It is unclear whether Isak had Newcastle’s permission to do so. There has also been no progress on a new and improved contract.Quick GuideMilner to wear Brighton's No 20 shirt in Jota tributeShowJames Milner will wear the number 20 shirt at Brighton this season in memory of the late Diogo Jota, describing his former Liverpool teammate as a 'great friend'.The Portuguese forward died aged 28 last month in a car accident, alongside his brother André Silva. Liverpool have retired the number 20 jersey worn by Jota at Anfield in tribute, and Milner has opted to switch from No 6 after Brighton teammate Carlos Baleba changed his squad number from No 20 to No 17.'Once I heard Carlos was looking to change his number and 20 was available, I wanted to do it as a mark of respect and pay tribute to Diogo Jota,\" Milner said. 'He was an amazing player who I was fortunate to play with and a great friend as well. It will be a great honour to wear his number in the Premier League this year.'Photograph: Bradley Ormesher/Times Newspapers LtdWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Isak, signed from Sociedad for around £60m in 2022, has three years remaining on his contract at St James’ Park. Newcastle have maintained that the forward is not for sale but have been attempting to sign other top-level strikers this summer, so far without success. Whether a breakthrough in Newcastle’s striker search softens their stance on Isak remains to be seen.Eddie Howe and his nephew, Andy Howe, have been overseeing the club’s recruitment this summer after Paul Mitchell stepped down as sporting director and with chief executive Darren Eales due to leave on health grounds. As well as Ekitiké, Newcastle have missed out on strikers Liam Delap, João Pedro and Bryan Mbeumo, along with goalkeeper James Trafford,who rejoined Manchester City.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We believe we deserve that, after the way the boys have gone about their business.But yes, it was fortuitous, we know that. I am relieved and pleased to get a win.“We are an evolving group. Adding lots of bodies, we are on the journey to the final product. We are not there yet, I think that’s obvious. But 100% we will get there. We still want to be better at the top part of the pitch. We got there a lot and weren’t clinical enough. There’s lots in my mind right now, but we have to be pleased to get off to a winning start.”After Luton struggled to break down their resilient first visitors of the season, Nahki Wells’ hopeful ball forward to Cauley Woodrow was met instead by the head of Johnson and looped agonisingly over goalkeeper Nathan Bishop, off the underside of the crossbar and over the line.On paper this should have been a mismatch – a team with recent Premier League pedigree and the promotion favourites entertaining the surprise outfit who came up from League Two last season with one of the lowest budgets in the division. Even on the day of the game, Luton had been waving the company credit card about, completing the signing of Portsmouth’s Cohen Bramall in the morning before snapping up Swansea’s Jerry Yates in the afternoon.View image in fullscreenNahki Wells (centre) celebrates with Shandon Baptiste (right) and Cauley Woodrow afer his hopeful long ball was headed home by Wimbledon’s Ryan Johnson.Photograph: Adam Davy/PABut not even Luton can rely on plastic to give them an advantage these days. No amount of spending power was ever going to negate Wimbledon’s aerial power but at least Luton seemed up for the battle.Bloomfield may be scratching his head about how to get his new signings to integrate better, but credit still has to be given to manager Johnnie Jackson for getting the most out of Wimbledon’s Crazy Gang spirit.“I’m gutted for my players and supporters. To lose the game in that manner was cruel,” Jackson said. “It’s a hard one to take, a horrible way to lose.But I was really pleased with the structure of the team. We didn’t do enough to go and win it, but I thought we deserved a draw.”What little goalmouth action this scrap produced occurred in the final minutes. Reuell Walters’ low 30-yard drive would have given the game the stunning winner it ill deserved but instead produced the only real save of the match from Bishop, on his Wimbledon debut.Nathan Asiimwe’s desperate block from Lamine Fanne 11 minutes from time was a sure sign Wimbledon were not going to just roll over. If only they had not scored Luton’s goal for them instead. It was desperately unlucky for Johnson, but Wimbledon will bounce back, and this was an occasion when misfortune very much had to be kept in perspective.Sky pundit and former Luton captain Tom Lockyer revealed he is less than a month away from being given the all-clear by doctors to resume his career. The skipper who led the club to the Premier League has not played since suffering a cardiac arrest during Luton’s game against Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium in December 2023, having snapped an ankle ligament during his long rehabilitation.“I’ve had a really good few weeks,” Lockyer said. “Hopefully now I’m four weeks away from getting signed off and told I’m allowed to play football again.”Explore more on these topicsLeague OneLuton TownAFC Wimbledonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I call on you to effect a sale to a suitable owner, and give the club a chance of a brighter future.”Lizzi Collinge, the Labour MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, said she was “devastated that this crisis is still dragging on, with the damage being done worsening every day”.Collinge called on Whittingham to “just sign the damn paperwork” and said the crisis would have been “entirely avoidable” if he had sold the club when the English Football League approved the deal in early June.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brian Clough pounced to sign the red-haired midfielder after he failed to agree a contract with Hibernian in the summer of 1985. “Eff me, it’s Steve Davis,” roared Clough as Rice entered the manager’s office for the first time.It took until September ‘85 for a tribunal to determine Nottingham Forest would have to pay Hibs close to £200,000 for Rice. He had been unable to play until that dispute was resolved. Clough bawled at Rice again as he walked on to the training pitch the following day. “‘You’ll need to go back to Scotland. I’d need to sell the stand to sign you son,’” Rice recalls.“You should have seen the look on my face. Then he just started laughing. The following week I made my debut at Anfield. Every day was different. You didn’t know if you were training, going to play cricket or for an ice cream.”Scottish football clubs owe more than £22m to government in Covid loansRead moreRice is still very welcome at Forest, where he is most fondly remembered for an audacious finish against Arsenal in a 1988 FA Cup quarter-final. He cites Johnny Metgod as the best player he lined up alongside. Rice also remembers how during a Clough rant at Metgod, the Dutch centre-back snapped back that Forest’s manager had signed him. “And I’ll sell you,” Clough retorted. A fortnight later, Metgod was a Tottenham player.The trouble is, this endearing trip down memory lane is a precursor to Rice’s broader tale. He will begin the new Scottish season back in the top flight as Livingston’s head of football operations, a switch upstairs after time spent on the coaching staff. Rice will be a loss on the training pitch – he is widely regarded as a superb coach – and an inevitable success in his new post. The 61-year-old’s knowledge of football in Scotland is encyclopedic.Rice did not begin gambling in the midst of Forest’s laddish culture. “Mine started when I was at school,” he says. “Throwing pennies against a wall, playing cards. I barely had a drink before I went to Nottingham because I wanted to be a football player and the training was intense. Drink really didn’t interest me, but I always gambled.View image in fullscreenBrian Rice (back row, far right) with his Nottingham Forest teammates after their Littlewoods Cup win in 1989.Photograph: PA Photos/PA“My dad gambled every day but that was 5p or 10p and it was fun to him. It was fun to me to start with, then it escalated. It takes a grip of you. I knew I had a problem, a massive problem. But in those days, to ask for help was a sign of weakness. Now I know it is a massive sign of strength.”Fast forward to January 2020 and the Scottish Football Association announce Rice, then the manager of Hamilton, has been given a 10-game ban for betting on matches. “October 15th,” he says. “I was going to watch Scotland Under-21s against Germany at Firhill. The phone went at half past four in the afternoon. It was the club secretary saying: ‘Brian, we have had the SFA on and they are going to investigate you regarding gambling in football.’ I said: ‘Thank God it is over.’“I was so relieved it was finished. The next day I went in to see the club owner, told him everything and made sure we went to the SFA and did the same. I gave them everything.” A whispering campaign ensued, including one that suggested Rice bet on games involving his own clubs. That proved to never be the case throughout a decade’s worth of wagers the SFA examined.Alongside the suspension, I had to go to meetings for a year. But it was the best punishment they could ever have given me.Scottish football’s relationship with gambling is complex. Betting firms as sponsors are everywhere. Any harm attached to Rice’s episode was primarily to himself. “It was self-inflicted,” he says. “I knew I was doing wrong. I don’t make excuses about it.“I don’t think in any other line of work you would be punished for having an addiction. You get help. But they did help me. Alongside the suspension, I had to go to meetings for a year. It was the best punishment they could ever have given me. I was going to three or four meetings a week and I still do that to this day. Those meetings have changed my life, educated me and let me know why I gambled. It has given me the foundations to have a better life. If I stop going there, my mindset could change again. I’m not ashamed, I am doing something about my problem.”View image in fullscreenBrian Rice on the touchline at the Tony Macaroni Arena in Livingston during his time as Hamilton manager in 2020.Photograph: SPP Sport Press Photo./Alamy“I know of cases that have been swept under the carpet, that nobody knows about,” Rice adds. “Players reported to be injured at their club and they aren’t. I know that for a fact because I have spoken to the players. But I think it is better that way, better than the way it came out with me. People have families as well.”Rice has had low points. Plenty of them. “I was on the top of the 32-storey building in Qatar and ready to step off it,” he says. “That’s where it took me.” His successful relationship with Falkirk counted for nothing when a fan used gambling as a means to abuse the then-manager at Alloa Athletic. “‘I hope it never happens to your family,’ I replied. It was horrible. They see it as banter and I have to take it. I didn’t that day because it was Falkirk and, to be fair to the club, they were fantastic. The guy didn’t have the guts to come forward.”The 24-hour, 365-days availability of betting is unlike when Rice played on either side of the border and he believes he sold himself short with trips to the horse racing, casino or bookie when he could have been training. He also urges young footballers to get in touch if they fear gambling issues are spiralling out of control.“I know the signs to look for,” Rice says. “In six years, I have helped more than a dozen players and am still doing so now. Players think it is a quick fix; stop gambling for a month and I’ll be cured. It’s not stopping gambling, which can be quite easy; it’s changing your habits. I had to completely change the way I lived, even the way I drove home so I wasn’t passing five betting shops. Fill your day better.”The day after our chat, I message Rice to express gratitude for his candour. “It’s my story and I’ve nothing left to hide from nowadays,” he replies. “Thanks again.” Judgment should include the fact he is one of the game’s good guys.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.org.

But how will this team evolve before then and what is there for all concerned to ponder?New coaches, new ideasWiegman’s team now enter a new era as they say farewell to her long-serving assistant Arjan Veurink, often hailed as key to their tactical success, as he heads off to become the Netherlands head coach. Geraint Twose, part of Wiegman’s backroom team for both of their Euro-winning campaigns, is also moving on to take up a new position as England’s lead transition coach, supporting players in the youth pathway. Arriving from the Netherlands are Janneke Bijl and Arvid Smit, and it will be interesting to see how, if at all, England’s style changes with them in place.The right-back conundrumLucy Bronze has made it clear she wants to play at the next World Cup. She will be 35-and-three-quarters when the tournament comes around and while her experience, leadership skills and mentality will ensure she is still England’s first-choice right-back if fit, the Lionesses need a plan B, just in case sports science discovers an injury so severe that Bronze cannot play through it, unlike a seemingly minor problem of a –checks notes–fractured tibia at the Euros. England had the Manchester United captain, Maya Le Tissier, waiting in the wings this summer, someone Wiegman sees as a right-back despite the fact she has played every match for her club at centre-back. Also in contention is Tottenham’s Ella Morris, who has impressed at right-back through England’s youth teams but suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in May.View image in fullscreenLucy Bronze is keen to play another tournament with England.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Richard Sellers/Apl/SportsphotoThe left-backdilemmaEngland have been without a consistently selected left-back for a generation, with no one making that position their own since the centurion Rachel Unitt more than a decade ago. Alex Greenwood did well in that position against Spain but she commonly plays at centre-back for Manchester City, and that is where Wiegman had intended to play the 31-year-old before the tournament began. Niamh Charles, who also played well when called upon from the bench, will be another option, but she will want to start more games for Chelsea between now and the World Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The USA, managed by Emma Hayes, will probably be the favourites, while the younger generation of stars breaking through with Germany and France will see them in contention too. Japan, who played some eye-catching football during their victory over the United States in the SheBelieves Cup in California in February, will also be a threat.

And if the 12 that signifies a hurricane is the highest measure on the Beaufort scale, you can almost certainly bet your bottom dollar that the West Ham midfielder’s sigh of relief upon discovering he had been cleared of spot-fixing accusations registered in the very high teens. Had Paquetá been found guilty of charges he deliberately got booked on multiple occasions so that assorted folk back home in Brazil could make the staggeringly insignificant sums reported to have been involved in this alleged global conspiracy, he was staring straight down the barrel of a lifetime ban from football.Having faced the possible ruin of his career and livelihood, not to mention the untold damage to his reputation that would have accompanied a guilty verdict, the 27-year-old is now free to continue playing, blissfully unencumbered by the giant boulder he has been carrying around on his shoulders since the accusations were levelled against him by the FA two years ago. And while he got there in the end and all’s well that ends well, it has now been suggested that both Paquetá and his famously litigious employersmight now have grounds to sue the FAfor both legal costs and the loss of tens of millions incurred by the entirely-related collapse of the player’s £85m move to Manchester City, shortly after the investigation was announced.“Since the first day of this investigation, I have maintained my innocence against these extremely serious accusations,” said Paquetá, who has been found guilty of two lesser charges of failing to cooperate fully with the investigation. “I can’t say anything more at this time, but I would like to express how grateful I am to God and how eager I am to return to playing football with a smile on my face.” Having given Paquetá their full support throughout his lengthy ordeal, West Ham will also be looking forward to seeing one of their best footballers back to his stress-free best, even if the smile on his face morphs into a rictus grin when he remembers he’s contracted to West Ham.Rumours abound that the Hammers may decide to cash in their chips while the player retains his value and there ought to be no shortage of takers at a decent price, albeit one around half that they negotiated with City. The smartish money currently suggests Paquetá could end up at Newcastle, who currently own more goalkeepers than midfielders but are rumoured to be on the verge of being forced into acceptinga large windfall of their own. Place your bets.QUOTE OF THE DAY“I am urging Jason Whittingham once again to just sign the damn paperwork.

It is hard to detect irony or sarcasm in the written form, and with no use of italics or other such such writing tropes, one had to take the sentence seriously. His goalscoring record, although not shabby, can’t be termed as prolific.

The 47-year-old has spent the past three seasons at Manchester United, in an instrumental academy role as a development-phase coach, and prior to that worked at Aston Villa, Cardiff, clubs for whom he also played, and Southampton. This may be his first real shot at frontline management – aside from a few months in charge of Barry Town more than two decades ago – but he is anything but inexperienced.The close season always brings change but it is hard to imagine a starker shift than Hughesswapping a global institution for Newport, with one of the smallest budgets in League Two. He has added two performance analysts to his team but it is a skeleton operation compared to United’s academy structure, where he worked closely with Nick Cox, who is moving to Everton as their technical director. “Big, big clubs have huge numbers of staff, different levels of responsibility and accountability,” Hughes says. “But we’re really pleased with our small staff. We came back for pre-season and the goals were green from last season, so we went out as staff cleaning the goalposts and I’m thinking: ‘We’ve got a team here.’ Everybody’s prepared to muck in.”League Two 2025-26 preview: the contenders, hopefuls and strugglersRead moreHughes, who was born in Wrexham, calls south Wales home and acknowledges Newport has never really been a place for bells and whistles. “Supporters expect to see some sweat on the shirt,” he says. “They expect to see positive body language: don’t throw your arms in the air, get on with it. Let’s not carry anyone. Supporters will definitely forgive a mistake if there’s a willingness and intent to press and engage and get after the ball and force mistakes and errors into your opponents.”Did Hughes anticipate the opportunity to manage a senior team? “It’s a good question,” he says. “Did I think it would come? I suppose the older you get, possibly not.” His time at United, where he coached academy players on the pitch next to the one used by the first team, only enhanced his education. “In your first week or two, you go round Old Trafford, the Munich [memorial], the museum and see the history and heritage that’s attached to the club, and the individuals that have come through, and there is a responsibility. It’s just the most fascinating, incredible place. I don’t think there’s another place like it. In my eyes, it’s the pinnacle of youth development.”Hughes tackles the sniffy perception of managers born in academy coaching. “Like it’s a bad thing,” he says. “I’m not sure there’s anything to be ashamed of in trying to help people evolve and improve. That’s commendable, right? And I would imagine every manager is trying to help their players develop and evolve to help them win. I’m quite proud of the fact that I’ve supported people to become successful … it definitely wasn’t down to me, it was down to them. And so that’s what we’re trying to do here. We’re trying to help the team become successful.” He insists there are many similarities between the roles. “What’s different now is ‘Saturday’, I guess,” he says.View image in fullscreenDavid Hughes issues instructions to his team during the pre-season friendly at Torquay United.Photograph: Frankie O’Keeffe/PPAUK/ShutterstockThis Saturday Newport host Notts County, who also have a new manager in Martin Paterson. Talking on a bench outside Newport’s training base at the University of South Wales campus in Treforest, Hughes is at ease in newish surroundings, citing a conversation with a loan player. “I went through a presentation we shared with our players on the first day and just said: ‘This is us, this is what we’ve got, and we’re really proud of it. It might not be what you’re used to where you’ve come from, but it’s ours.’ Let’s not look over the fence at what other people have got.”Newport have done things their way in pre-season, completing a recovery session at the lido in Pontypridd and heading to the former boxer Jamie Arthur’s gym in nearby Rhydyfelin.“It was almost like a mental toughness, conditioning session,” says Hughes. “It was just to try and take the group somewhere else … where you think about the skill set you need to be a boxer, they definitely suffer to win. And all we’re trying to do is have a culture where we understand and appreciate that winning looks different at times. To win games of football, at times you’ve got to suffer.”That pain was apparent on Tuesday, when Newport overcame Barnet on penalties to reach the EFL Cup first round after squandering their two-goal lead in second-half stoppage time. That triumph represented Hughes’s first match and win, and it was a game in which Newport donned their strikingnew away kit– commemorating the 36 children who relocated to Caerleon from Bilbao after fleeing the Spanish civil war in 1937 – for the first time. The shirt is modelled on Athletic’s red-and-white stripes and on the label, beneath the flags of the Basque Country and Wales, a message reads: “In 1937, when the Basque people needed help, Wales responded.”As for those who have helped Hughes along the way and whether he consulted them before signing a two-year contract at Rodney Parade, the answer is yes. Hughes, who credits his youth-team coach at Villa, Tony McAndrew, as a big influence, spoke to, among others, Rob Edwards, who swapped his role with England’s age groups for Forest Green Rovers in the fourth tier, the Wales manager Craig Bellamy and Sean Dyche, whom he worked alongside at Watford.View image in fullscreenMichael Reindorf celebrates scoring Newport’s equaliser against Barnet in their Carabao Cup preliminary round match.Photograph: Kian Abdullah/Huw Evans/Shutterstock“We all see the game differently but there are pillars that underpin performance and hard work has to be one of those,” Hughes says, referencing positive conversations with the Newport chairman, Huw Jenkins, who completed his takeover 18 months ago. “Success will look different for us compared to other teams. We’re aware of the constraints we’re under, but those constraints are definitely not excuses,” Hughes says. “We know it’s going to be tough, we know there’s going to be some turbulence along the way. But, most importantly, we’re going to enjoy it.”Explore more on these topicsNewport CountyLeague TwointerviewsShareReuse this content"

But it is understood that Bayern requested the option to make the move permanent at the end of the season for €30m (£27m) be added during negotiations this week and that was accepted.Palhinha has three years remaining on his current contract but is believed to have been keen to return to the Premier League after enjoying two successful seasons in west London. He only made six starts in the Bundesliga under Vincent Kompany.Tottenham’s board have a good relationship with their Bayern counterparts, having signed Mathys Tel this summer for around £30m after the French forward spent the second half of last season on loan in north London, as well as agreeing previous deals for Harry Kane and Eric Dier.Quick GuideMilner to wear Brighton's No 20 shirt in Jota tributeShowJames Milner will wear the number 20 shirt at Brighton this season in memory of the late Diogo Jota, describing his former Liverpool teammate as a 'great friend'.The Portuguese forward died aged 28 last month in a car accident, alongside his brother André Silva.

But while India were initially skittled for 224 by the completion of Gus Atkinson’s fourth five-wicket haul in Test cricket, England then folded to 247 all out and an opportunity to take full control had gone begging.The injuryChris Woakes sustainedon day one not only ruined his Ashes but it also left England a bowler down in this series finale. As well as needing to give the remainder of the attack time off their feet, this meant securing a decent lead. On a day when £124,000 was raised for Mind in memory of Graham Thorpe, here was a challenge he would have relished. Lasting a mere 51.2 overs and nudging just 23 runs ahead, they fell short, undone by the only seamer to go the distance in this brutal series. Not for the first time in his career when Jasprit Bumrah is missing, Mohammed Siraj delivered the tamasha, sharing eight wickets with the recalled Prasidh Krishna.Both quicks snarled their way through an afternoon in which the removal of six Englishmen for 106 runs swung the pendulum back to India. By the close, having been plunged back into the field, Ollie Pope’s three-man seam attack had picked up the 14th and 15th wicket of the day. But with India reaching 75 for two – a lead of 52 – a 2-2 series draw was still loading.Gus Atkinson punches ticket to Ashes as obvious key peg in England’s attack | Barney RonayRead moreIf so – and this Test remains hugely volatile, given the seaming surface – then England’s approach will once again be questioned, both the high-wire batting and their broader propensity to unspool at the end of a series. Although the most productive stand came when Bazball’s lizard brain was most in play: when conservative thoughts are fully parked and only the upside to unfettered aggression is considered.AfterAtkinson doused the Indiantail first thing, Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley crunched 92 runs between them during 12.5 overs of morning chaos. Crawley slapped 14 fours en route to 64 from 57 balls but Duckett was the catalyst, with his 43 from 38 a veritable flurry of impish ramped sixes and charged square smacks that startled Oval’s birdlife.This white-knuckle ride was terminated before lunch, however, through the inevitable downside to all this. Duckett’s latest premeditated attempt to reverse scoop to Akash Deep was gloved behind – red meat for England’s critics, even if they will have to concede the shot’s previous profitability.View image in fullscreenGus Atkinson celebrates after dismissing Sai Sudharsan on Friday evening as India closed on 75 for two to lead by 52.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersWhat followed raised a few eyebrows. Deep threw an arm around Duckett’s shoulder and offered a few words to go with it. No one was quite sure if England’s opener was fine with this or simply holding firm.In a series of increasing bad blood, the amateur lip-readers were struggling – not that getting in a batter’s space after winning the contest is ever a great idea.There are few who relish such spice more than Siraj and when England resumed on 109 for one after lunch, his spiky eight-over burst of three for 35 ripped out of their middle order. Bowling full, and with impressive energy given the miles on the clock, a trio of lbws took Pope, for 22 runs, and Joe Root, 29, both undone by balls that jagged back and Jacob Bethell, six, yorked.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The right-hander did swell this to 53, including one outrageous tumbling swept six. But after Atkinson came and went – and with Woakes batting a non-starter – he was the last to fall. Fittingly it was Siraj who shut things down here as another ball nipped back to rattle the stumps.The final 18 overs continued the fast forward action. Josh Tongue ended KL Rahul’s series on an excellent 532 runs at 53.2, Atkinson pinned his old Surrey teammate Sai Sudharsan lbw late on. But Yashasvi Jaiswal ransacked a rapid 51 not out. To sum up the day – possibly the series at large – two chances to end it early slipped through English fingers.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The 24-year-old winger, who has started the first two Tests, sat out the captain’s run on Friday and it is understood he is struggling with a back injury. The Lions are targeting a first clean sweep since 1927 and a first unbeaten series since 1974.On Friday the Lions were adamant that Freeman would be fit to play in Sydney, claiming his absence was down to his workload being managed. It is understood, however, that contingency plans have been drawn up that could see Huw Jones moved to the wing and Owen Farrell coming into the starting XV.Andy Farrell has earned right to choose if he wants to coach Lions in 2029 | Ugo MonyeRead moreMack Hansen would be an option if fully fit but he has missed the first two Tests with a foot injury and was deemed “85%” fit earlier in the week. Other options include Duhan van der Merwe and James Lowe with Blair Kinghorn switching from the left to the right wing. Jamie Osborne could also be a consideration.This season Freeman has featured in 33 matches, surpassing the 30-match limit mandated by the Rugby Football Union.“He was just doing the light walk-throughs,” said the assistant coach John Dalziel. “Wingers will do a lot of high-intensity running so he had the morning off. He’s got to view a stadium which is hopefully going to come to life tomorrow.“There’s no easy way to be a winger when you are chasing kicks and balls up in the air in the way the first two Tests have gone, so it’s quite easy for those guys to get their metres up.”Tadhg Furlong, meanwhile, has called on the Lions to make lasting memories as the tourists seek to wrap up a first clean sweep since 1927. The Ireland tighthead prop will make his ninth consecutive start for the Lions, moving to joint fifth on the all-time list and though the 32-year-old did not entirely rule out the 2029 trip to New Zealand, he conceded the clash in Sydney is likely to be his last for the touring side.“You’re still playing for the Lions, it’s not hard to motivate yourself,” he said. “My motivation is obvious. I’m not going to say I won’t [but] I probably won’t play for the Lions again. It’s been very good to me. It’s been very good to my career. You want to play well in it.“Without being clinical about it, you want to give the best version of yourself to it. Sometimes the last memory is the lasting memory you have in a jersey. I want it to be a good one. I think you can use [that] towards your advantage, just the appreciation of it. Understanding what makes the Lions so special or why it’s so special to you. You don’t want to get too caught up and emotional about it because you have to do a job.“Lions tours are some of the best days of your career and I’m delighted to be able to go again.”View image in fullscreenTadhg Furlong is set to play in his ninth successive Lions Test.Photograph: David Davies/PAThere were question marks over Furlong’s fitness at the start of the tour after he arrived into camp in June with no game time since early May due to a calf problem. “It wasn’t a big enough injury to warrant [thinking I wouldn’t make it],” he added. “It was like, we need to get back and play here, lads, because it’s on your calendar. You want it so badly. I think the cruel thing is when you go on one, you just want to go on more. You go on that first one and you take it all in.“The second one, you want to perform and the third one you just want to appreciate it all because you don’t want it to pass you by. There was a stage this season where we were having conversations with medical staff. It’s like, what is going on here? We need to nip this stuff in the bud.”While Furlong forms part of an unchanged all Leinster and Ireland front row, Australia have changed two-thirds of theirs with Taniela Tupou coming in at tighthead and Billy Pollard promoted to the No 2 jersey after a late injury to Dave Porecki. Tupou nicknamed “the Tongan Thor” has endured a difficult season in Super Rugby and will head to Racing 92 next season but Furlong is only too aware of the threat posed by the 23-stone prop.“I first came across him in 2018, he was a young fella breaking through,” said Furlong. “He was coming off the bench for Australia. He is what he says in the tin. He’s incredibly powerful. He’s dangerous in the scrum. Very aggressive. He poses his own threats around the park. He’s a good carrier, explosive.”Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsLions tour 2025Australia rugby union teamAustralia sportRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Mauritian did not panic and her dogged pursuit of the group containing Niewiadoma, Vollering and Ferrand-Prévot paid off when she rejoined them close to the finish.“I think I almost died a few times on the descent,” Le Court said. “The last 4km of the uphill were difficult. My body just completely shut off.View image in fullscreenKim Le Court breathes a sigh of relief after recovering to retain the yellow jersey.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesOnce I got to the top, I knew I had to do the best downhill of my life to try and come back. I did a recon of the descent a few weeks ago so I knew what was coming, and I just had to go full gas. I think I went 10 times faster than the recon.”Meanwhile, on the eve of the toughest mountain stage in the race, Ferrand-Prévot’s drastic weight loss was the subject of some scrutiny after images of her racing jersey, pinned at the sleeve so it didn’t hang loosely, emerged in the Dutch media.The debate has been fuelled by comments made by French rider Cédrine Kerbaol who, alarmed by the weight loss among her peers, told French media: “We’re in a dangerous moment. There are a lot of people that have won big races with very low weight, and young girls, who are trying to perform, will take them as an example. What’s happening is not great.”“Top-level sport is extreme in every way,” Rutger Tijssen, sport technical manager at Ferrand-Prévot’s Visma-Lease a Bike team, told Sporza.On SaturdayToday, when the women’s peloton will tackle both the 13km-long Col de Plainpalais and, later, a summit finish on the “beyond category” Col de la Madeleine – an 18.6km climb to 2,000m – power-to-weight ratios will be pivotal.“Pauline’s leaner than in the spring,” Tijssen said, “but this also requires different things when you have to climb the Col de la Madeleine. Then it’s logical that you adapt.”Ferrand-Prévot won the Olympic mountain bike title at Paris 2024 but has since devoted herself to road racing with the goal of winning theTour de France Femmes.“She’s not much leaner than she was a year ago,” Tijssen said. “Of course, she stays healthy. You know what’s happening and you make choices, which we monitor.”The next 48 hours will decide the outcome of the race, which includes summit finishes on the Madeleine and at Châtel, as well as the daunting climb of the Col de Joux Plane on Sunday. Only 35 seconds currently separate the top five in the overall standings, but with more than 6,000 metres of climbing still to come, those gaps are certain to widen.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesCyclingTour de FrancenewsShareReuse this content"

I’m very grateful for that,” Rees-Zammit told Sky Sports News. “The season starts pretty soon. So it’s about finding the right team for me in terms of location, in terms of how quick I’ve got to get into camp, and because the season’s right around the corner, so all of these things that are going to happen, are going to happen pretty sharpish.“Me and my brother are going through negotiations and seeing teams interested, which is amazing,” the 24-year-old added. “We should find out in the next week or so.”Rees-Zammit, who made 32 appearances for Wales and toured with the British & Irish Lions in 2021, added that he hopes to rekindle his international career. “Playing for my country is the pinnacle and it’s one that I absolutely love doing,” he said.“I managed to play 32 times for my country in three, four years. I need to find a team. Once we find a team, get into good form and hopefully come Autumn internationals, see where selection is. It’s something that I’m really looking forward to and I really want to play for my country again.”The news is likely to come as a welcome boost to the recently appointed Wales head coach, Steve Tandy, who takes over a side thatended an 18-match losing streakthat lasted almost two years with a hard-fought win over Japan in Kobe last month.Rees-Zammit announced in January 2024 that he was retiring from rugby union in orderto pursue his dream of playing in the NFLvia its International Player Pathway Program.The former Gloucester back signed an active roster deal with the Jacksonville Jaguars for the 2025 season after being part of their practice squad for the 2024 season and travelled to London for the games against the Chicago Bears and New England Patriots in October.Earlier on Friday, Rees-Zammit said in a post on Instagram: “I’ve got an exciting announcement to make! I’ve decided to leave the NFL and return to rugby! It’s been a great experience, but it’s time to come home. I’ve decided that this is the best time to make this decision to give myself time to get everything in place for next season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Utah CEO tells Guardian he’s confident funds can be foundMartin PengellyFri 1 Aug 2025 10.43 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 10.44 EDTShareMajor League Rugby has endured a tough week with a merger and a withdrawal reducing the competition to nine teams, but the US men’s professional rugby union competition could yet fall to just seven entrants if two more teams fail to raise new funds, the Guardian learned.Themergerof the San Diego Legion and RFC Los Angeles and theexitof the NOLA Gold were announced on Wednesday.As fans digested that news, multiple league sources told the Guardian the Utah Warriors (like San Diego and NOLA a founding team in 2018) and the Miami Sharks, an expansion team in 2024, were seeking new funding. Sources differed on the likelihood of funding being secured.Kimball Kjar, a former US Eagles scrum-half now Utah chief executive, said: “Utah Warriors are a founding member of Major League Rugby. We set out to build something special, and we’re still committed to that vision of creating top-end professional rugby in North America.“We still believe in that vision, and we’re working aggressively to continue on with supporting our partners in Major League Rugby.”Describing a “hefty financial lift”, Kjar said Utah’s “ownership group has made it clear that they want to bring on additional partners and people that can continue to help accelerate and build and grow in the way that we intend to grow”.Milagros Cubelli, the Miami CEO, could not be reached for comment.In the MLR season just completed, the Warriors and Sharksreached the play-offsfor thefirst time. In the Championship Game, in Providence, Rhode Island, the New England Free Jacksbeat the Houston SaberCatsfor a third successive title.Of the seven teams that kicked off MLR in 2018, only Houston, Utah and thetwice-championSeattle Seawolves remain. San Diego, three times finalists, are now part of the California Legion.Asked if MLR could continue if shrunk back to seven teams, Commissioner Nic Benson told the Guardian: “I think so. If you have the right seven teams, a strong core, my answer today is yes.”Benson added: “I think the reality of this is, this is hard. It’s a labor of love and belief for a lot of people that we can build exceptional value in this sport. I still believe that, and I think a lot of the owners still believe that if we get this right, this is viable and will be good for the sport.”The MLR Players Associationsaidit was working with players affected by the closure and merger, “to provide clarity on next steps and equitable solutions” and to “ensure that players are properly taken care of”.MLR is far from alone in facing financial headwinds: even in England, the Gallagher Premiership lost three teams in 2022-23 and now appears narrowly to have avoided reducing to nine entrants, atakeoversaving Newcastle.News from MLR may nonetheless prompt concern at World Rugby, less than two weeks after itstagedan internationaldoubleheaderin Washington DC, heralding concerted investment in the run-up to US World Cups in 2031 (men) and 2033 (women).Super Rugby (Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific), the United Rugby Championship (Wales, Ireland, Scotland, Italy and South Africa) and R360, amootedtransnational competition fronted by the former England center Mike Tindall, are all reported to be eyeing US ventures.World Rugby did not respond to a request for comment on MLR from its chief executive, Alan Gilpin. But in DC in mid-July, Gilpin told the Guardian World Rugby had “always believed … there needs to be a domestic professional league in the US that’s growing and thriving [and] we want MLR to be that … that collection of owners, whether we think they’re doing things right or wrong, are putting $70 million a year in, of their own money. That’s not to be dismissed. And so we want MLR to be successful.“But there’s no doubt that both in terms of providing the best quality product to fans in this market and providing the best opportunities for players to progress in the US … some form of cross-border competition, whether that’s Super Rugby Pacific, URC, or the other things that have been talked about, could be a really good addition.“But it needs to be not killing [MLR] in the way that happens … So we’ve been in some of those conversations, which I think is positive again.”World Rugby, Gilpin said, “wants to be helpful, if it can help invest in the structure of the game … our conversation with anybody is, ‘We welcome the investment but you’ve got to come in and work with us, with existing stakeholders, to make that sustainable.’”On Thursday, Kjar of Utah Warriors likened MLR to a successful US league that endured turbulent beginnings, telling the Guardian: “MLR is really no different from where Major League Soccer was … in 2002 to 2003, where there’s some some hard questions that are being asked, and certain teams and certain ownership groups are … able to provide the best answers to those questions and we feel pretty confident in our situation and what we’re trying to do.“We’re above all confident in what MLR is, and what our partners have built together.’”Elsewhere, a current MLR team owner, speaking on condition of anonymity, backed Benson in saying the league could continue even if reduced to seven teams.“The original number was seven,” the owner said, “so the league functioned with seven. For some reason, people pick that as the demarcation line, like, ‘Below eight probably means we’re not viable.’ We want to play.“Yeah, there’s a couple question marks. One of the teams that was a question mark feels they’ve got funding.“What did Winston Churchill say? ‘It’s always darkest before dawn.’ I mean, it’s pretty dark right now. I will say there’s a lot of introspection, and questioning.”Martin Pengelly writes on Substack atThe National Maul, on rugby in the US.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionUS sportsShareReuse this content"

With a record 1.35m watching stateside, at least one wondered if, in some alternate universe in which they could play in the Euros, they would have won it.Asked that question on arecent episodeof The Women’s Game podcast, US captain and OL Lyonnes midfielder Lindsey Heaps suggested that they could. While debriefing England’s wild quarter-final comeback against Sweden with retired World Cup champion Sam Mewis, Heaps began by noting the difficulty of comparing Emma Hayes’ program in transition to mid-tournament teams: “It’s so hard because we’re obviously missing a lot of players,” she said. “But we have a lot of new, young players, inexperienced players, that are doing so well. I think it would be so hard to say. Also, Emma would fully prepare us for a tournament, and tournament mode. So it’d be a little bit different than what we’ve been doing, and how we’ve been playing.”But nodding to the team’s psyche, she added: “[It] goes back to mentality. I will always say, like, we would be, we would be killing it and winning.”The internet, of course, was quick to point out what happened two years ago in Melbourne, with some fans seemingly aghast that the team’s belief remains intact after an ignominious World Cup exit against European opposition. Others, of course, noted last summer’s triumph in Paris, when Emma Hayes led the program to its fifth gold medal just 76 days after her first training session in charge of the team.NWSL and US Soccer’s lack of transgender policy targeted by conservative lobby groupsRead moreThis summer’s USWNT team isn’t the team it was in 2023, when they suffered their earliest-ever departure from a competition they’d dominated. For that matter, it’s also not the team it was last year in Paris, or the one it likely will be by the next World Cup.So, with the players presently available, inthisiteration of the USWNT, would they have broken hearts in Switzerland?Probably not. They may not have been far off, though.Head-to-head comparisons are imprecise because of changing dynamics for the US and their UEFA counterparts over the past few years. But the US’s recent record against Euro ‘25 contenders isn’t as bleak as one might think, given the still-lingering taste of bitter defeat on the sport’s grandest stage.The US has played six of the 16 teams that battled to reach Basel during or since the 2023 World Cup. That includes Iceland (twice in friendlies), Portugal (2023 World Cup), Germany (twice at the Olympics), England (one friendly), the Netherlands (once in a friendly and once at the World Cup), and of course, Sweden. Of those nine tests against Euro ‘25 competitors, the US won five, drew three and lost once in a penalty shootout. Four of those wins came against Iceland and Germany, with the other secured against the Dutch.That’s not too bad, though half of those teams lost in the group stage in Switzerland. Of this summer’s eight quarter-finalists, the USWNT has played four and beaten just one of them (Germany) stretching back to 2022. Unfortunately, while the Olympics were a redemptive run for the felled giants, Germany (who they beat twice) were the only Euro team they faced, and thus their only opportunity to test a renewed mettle against Uefa opponents. That said, they did go on to beat Brazil, who sent France and Spain packing in the preceding rounds.It seems probable, given the recently-proven talent of the US against competitors like Ireland and Canada (missing players and all) that they could reach the knockout phase of this summer’s Euros. But as they reached toward the final rounds, or perhaps even the final, they might feel the difference between the team available for friendlies this June, and the one that won the gold medal. Most notably, that includes the formidable force propelling the team to glory at both ends of the pitch. Along the frontline: ‘triple espresso’ and their combined ten goals. At the other end: Alyssa Naeher.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are hopeful contenders to fill those enormous shoes, including Manchester United goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce. But at this moment, the team is far away from having the tried and trusted hands of Naeher available to support them. Especially given the plethora of penalties that in many ways defined this Euros (for goalkeepers and penalty takers alike), the present keeper pool is too untested on that type of stage to say confidently they’re ready to pull through like Naeher did at the Olympics.At the other end of the pitch, Swanson, Rodman and Smith were not simply goalscorers that were fun to watch. They were big moment players capable of changing the game individually, with big tournament pressure and all the world’s eyes on their back. Their prolonged absence has forced the opportunity to find new ways and players to score, and in recent windows a number of names have shown their skill in the final third (that somehow includes defensive midfielder Sam Coffey, who ended the June window with three goals in five games while cementing her name in Emma Hayes midfield). Beyond Coffey, it’s been encouraging to observe new combinations of attackers work on ways to break down opponents and score goals. The skill is there, but the finished product is a work in progress. And the gamechanging greatness of triple espresso in Paris is a hard spark to immediately replace. (By 2027, they may not have to).Emma Hayes delivered gold 76 days after her first training session. Today, 14 months into her long-term project, the US is certainly on track to compete with the top competitors from this summer’s Euros. If they were thrown into the fray in Switzerland this summer, they’d have been competitive, but are likely a few years off from being a team ready to take the top prize.Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamUS sportsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He also retweeted a petition calling for repeal of the act that has garnered more than 450,000 signatures.X has been forced toage-restrict some contentas a consequence, with the Reform UK party adding to the furore by pledging to repeal the act. Reform’s commitment prompted the UK technology secretary, Peter Kyle, toaccuse Nigel Farageof siding with the paedophile Jimmy Savile, a comment Farage described as “below the belt” and deserving of an apology.Referring to Ofcom, X said regulators had taken a “heavy-handed approach” to enforcing the act by “rapidly increasing enforcement resources” and “adding layers of bureaucratic oversight”.The statement said: “The act’s laudable intentions are at risk of being overshadowed by the breadth of its regulatory reach. Without a more balanced, collaborative approach, free speech will suffer.”X said it was compliant with the act but the threat of enforcement and fines – which in the case of social media platforms such as X could be as high as 10% of global turnover – could encourage censorship of legitimate content in order to avoid punishment.The statement also mentioned plans to create anational internet intelligence investigations teamto monitor social media for signs of anti-migrant disorder. X said the proposal may be positioned as a safety measures but “it clearly goes far beyond that intent”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is no requirement on them to restrict legal content for adult users.”A UK government spokespersonsaid companies faced fines under the act for failing to protect freedom of expression as well as for allowing children to view harmful content.They said: “It is demonstrably false that the Online Safety Act compromises free speech.

Despite being one of Bollywood’s most bankable superstars for more than three decades, he realised that only tiny numbers of Indians were watching him on the big screen.Indian cinema is widely adored and has an outsized influence on society but just 2-3% of its 1.4 billion people go to the cinema.One longstanding problem is access, in particular in rural areas. Khan, who has starred in, directed and produced celebrated films including Lagaan, 3 Idiots and Taare Zameen Par, spent years trying to develop a plan to build thousands of low-cost cinemas in India’s rural hinterland where films could be beamed in via satellite. However, the initiative was stymied by relentless bureaucracy.Cost, too, has become a big obstacle. In the past, going to the cinema was a vibrant, often rowdy communal affair, where families would pack out single-screen cinemas amid cheering, dancing and whistling, with tickets costing just a few rupees. But as multiplexes have come to dominate in India, it has become a luxury experience. Tickets now regularly cost upwards of 500 rupees (£4.30) – unaffordable to most families in India.View image in fullscreenAamir Khan and Gracy Singh in Lagaan (Once Upon a Time in India), 2001.Photograph: AJ Pics/Alamy“When my first film came out the cinema tickets were 10 rupees and whole families from all classes could afford to come [and] pack out cinema halls,” said Khan, 60. “But the reality is that theatres are no longer a mass medium, it’s become an upper-class medium. And as film-makers, we haven’t done enough to change that and reach that other 97% of the population.”Instead, he said people had found other ways to watch films: either waiting for them to come on to satellite television or watching grainy pirated versions on their phones.This week, however, Khan presented what he promised would be the solution – or what he described as the “future for Indian cinema”. After a traditional cinematic run, his latest release, Sitaare Zameen Par (Stars on Earth), will be made available for audiences exclusively onYouTubefor just 100 rupees, the equivalent of less than £1. Other films in his back catalogue and future releases will follow.His choice of YouTube, known more as a place to watch trailers than full movies, was deliberate. Of all entertainment platforms, YouTube’s reach in India – with 491 million users – far outstretches other traditional streaming services such asNetflix, which has about 12 million subscribers in India. It was, said Khan, “an absolute no-brainer when you consider the reach it has”.“Internet penetration in India is now huge so you don’t need physical theatres to reach an audience any more,” Khan said. “I believe this is the model that will reach out to the maximum number of people and also serve the film industry’s creative community. Of course, the first place for our films should always be theatres. But then they should be available to the bulk of the country at an affordable price.”Khan said he would always prefer people to watch his films on the big screen but the reality was that theatres were not catering to the audience he wanted to reach.He said: “The idea with this is that 100 rupees would be paid by a whole family to watch the film together, maybe with their neighbours as well, so the cost per head would be very low.”View image in fullscreenAamir Khan with Gunjan Soni, the managing director of YouTube India.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPAKhan’s decision to offer an alternative is also a response to the detrimental role he believes streaming has played in the crisis being faced by Indian cinema.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the past decade, since right-wing Hindu nationalist politics have come to dominate India, film-makers have accused India’s film censors of being draconian and blocking anything politically contentious.Bollywood’s biggest male stars – Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, often referred to as the “trinity of Khans” – are all Muslim and have been targeted by nationalists, who have mobilised hate campaigns and boycotts of their films and accused them of being “anti-India”. Khan continues to be haunted by comments he made a decade ago, stating that he felt unsafe amid “rising intolerance”, which prompted protests.Khan acknowledged that many in the industry felt their creative instincts were being curbed by people in positions of strength who know very little about mass communication. “They feel they don’t have the freedom to say things the way they want to and how they want to,” he said.But Khan said censorship and other pressures faced by Indian cinema were nothing new and dated back to the 1940s. “Every society has a certain percentage of people who are negative in their outlook and that is not going to disappear.”Despite entertaining thoughts of retirement – as well as a brief period during the pandemic when he “secretly retired for six months” – Khan said he remained excited by the possibilities of cinema in India. “I’m really hopeful this new model will work,” he said. “If it doesn’t, we’re all in trouble.”Explore more on these topicsBollywoodIndiaFilm industrySouth and central AsiaYouTubeNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Those who play games on the toilet, and those who pretend they don’t. I am a proud member of the former category. I realise this may not be the most “Guardian” of Guardian article openings, but we all use the toilet and we all play games; I am merely providing a Venn diagram.We used to read books in there. I even had a small bookcase in mine, and am old enough to remember when a workplace was not considered civilised unless there was a copy of that day’s newspaper in every cubicle so that hard working staff could catch up with global goings on during their five minutes of down-the-pan time.Once we felt confident to admit we were all reading in there, the toilet book became a publishing phenomenon. Whether this was implicit in the case of, say, QI: The Book of General Ignorance or explicit in the case of Uncle John’s Bathroom Reader. Both provided snack-sized nuggets of erudite entertainment that made bathroom visits doubly productive.Phones changed all that. Soon grown men were whipping out their Nokia and playing with a different kind of Snake. Floppy newspapers made way for Flappy Birds.My own toilet gaming predated phones, beginning with Nintendo Game & Watch. A couple of my school chums were lucky enough to own them, and I’ve yet to see a greater example of true friendship than someone allowing you to take their Oil Panic handheld into the privy. Before that I used to make up a game where I would see how fast I could start and then stop the stopwatch on my Casio digital watch. My record was 0.07 seconds. But I was a younger man then.Ironically, dedicated handheld gaming machines never worked in there for me. The Game Boy was too large and fancy and there was no point entering with a Game Gear or Atari Lynx because the batteries wouldn’t cover a single visit.The Game Boy Advance SP was a quantum leap in toilet gaming because it was small and discreet with 10 hours of battery life. But that’s where I learned the pitfalls of toilet gaming. It needed to be an undemanding game you could play in bite-sized chunks. Advance Wars nearly killed me. The later missions had me sitting there so long that when I tried to get off the seat my legs would be asleep and I’d topple over like a rotten tree in a forest. Thankfully, no one else was in there to hear, so I didn’t make a sound.In the modern world, the toilet is conducive to gaming because there are no distractions. No one is bothering you in there. And, equally importantly, it is guilt free. Parenting begets gamer’s guilt. You always feel you should be doing something more “worthwhile”. Helping the kids with school stuff or working harder to ringfence their future from the slings and arrows of an outrageously fragile world. The toilet becomes a mini oasis of isolated tranquility and undisturbed gaming where you answer the call of nature rather than the yell of parenthood.View image in fullscreenZenith … Lego Hill Climb Adventures.Photograph: FingersoftMy toilet gaming has increased the older my children get. I refuse to fix our noisy bathroom fan because it’s the only thing that drowns their voices out. In recent times Alto’s Adventure, Pocket Run Pool, Prune, NFL RB25,Pocket Card JockeyandMarvel Snaphave proved perfect bathroom companions that you can skim the fun from without sitting there so long that your family reports you missing. The absolute zenith of my toilet gaming is Lego Hill Climb Adventures, which I use when I pop into the powder room to cope with workplace stress. (As much as I loveBalatroyou don’t have time to win a game without getting pins and needles, but you do have just enough time to lose one.)Gaming is so immersive it helps you forget the outside and what you are in there to do. That’s why we started reading in the first place: as a bowel-loosening distraction from the business at hand. I started gaming as a child, with our ZX Spectrum set up in a cupboard. I could shut the door and escape from parents who constantly and loudly fought into an alternate world where problems could be solved. That’s why games appealed to me in the first place. I am glad they can still do the same nearly half a century later in the smallest, safest room of all.Explore more on these topicsGamesHandheldMobile gamescommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s a rundown of the top nostalgia-inducing gamesKeith StuartFri 1 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 12.44 EDTShareThe seaside day trip remains an almost essential component of the school summer holidays, and although the big beachfront arcades have changed a lot over the last decade, they are still a magnet for small kids with handfuls of change, as well as adults hoping to spy an old Space Invaders cabinet in the back. As a child of the 1980s, coin-op video games were an obsession, but what really fascinated me were the older machines, the electro-mechanical oddities that hung on into the digital age. Here are 10 of the best – please add your own in the comments.Electro-mechanical driving gamesLong before the arrival of computer chips and CRT monitors, arcade driving games featured projected images of landscapes or even scrolling paintings to give the impression of hurtling along a road. The first examples arrived in the 1930s and a few later models, such as Chicago Coin’s Speedway and Sega’s Grand Prix stuck around in seaside arcades well into the 1980s. I remember playing a later example, Kasco’s astonishing 1979 arcade game The Driver, on the pier at Blackpool. It used 16mm footage of a real race to put you right in the action.Air hockeyThere was a time when the rapid-fire noise of plastic pucks rebounding around large snooker-like tables was a constant soundtrack in larger arcades. Air Hockey was invented by US company Brunswick Billiards in 1969 and it quickly caught on across the globe offering a fast-paced alternative to pool and table football. You can still find them in retro arcades, especially in traditional seaside towns such as Great Yarmouth, Blackpool and Southend.Derby gamesThese large installations feature tin horses lining up on a race track – six to eight players each sit at a cabinet in front of the course and throw balls at a target in order to move their equine racer toward the finishing line: the most accurate player wins. It seems the original version of the game, Kentucky Derby, was brought to Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the 1920s by George Valentine Tonner, an Irish-American soldier, jockey and amusement park concessionaire who also patented an early version of dodgems. Later examples swap horses for donkeys or camels, while a smaller variant, The Derby by Whittaker Bros, invited multiple players to bet on the outcome of automated horse races for a modest payback.Egg vending machinesToy vending machines followed gumball machines into American stores, cafes and station platforms in the 1930s, but it was in 1965 that the firstgachaponmachine was installed in a shop in Tokyo by entrepreneur Ryuzo Shigeta. These dispensed their wares in cute little plastic capsules, and the idea caught on. More commonly known as egg machines in the UK, most 1980s seaside arcades would have a couple outside the entrance, the most famous examples beingGlendale’s Oranges and Lemonsand Lucky Eggs machines, the later of which would dispense your prize from a rotating, clucking hen – which made it that much more special.Basketball hoopsYou’d get rows of these large machines, often at the back of the arcade, giving players a number of chances to lob a basketball through a hoop, usually within a caged play area so you didn’t accidentally launch the ball across the room. Classics such as Hoop Shot, Triple Jam and Full Court Fever added features including moving hoops and connected play so you could compete against pals on nearby machines. This was always where the rowdy teens hung out.Fortune telling machinesView image in fullscreen‘I wanna be big’ … a Zoltar fortune-telling arcade machine in Coney Island, New York.Photograph: Edward Westmacott/AlamyOriginating in the late 19th century these arcade and boardwalk amusements usually feature animated automatons, often stereotypical representations of Gypsies, witches or ancient Middle Eastern royalty. Put in a coin and the mystic character gestures, breathes and speaks your fortune (or deposits a card with your fortune written on it), accompanied by special effects such as a glowing crystal ball. Notable examples include Madame Zita, the creepy 1977 innovationMorgana, whose face is a video projection on to a featureless foam head, andZoltar, which inspired the 1988 movie Big. Other automaton machines feature dancing puppets and absolutely terrifying laughing clowns.Punch ballBeloved of young men keen toprove their masculinity, these have been around since at least 190o when the Chicago-based Mills Novelty Co released its Punching Bag model, complete with ornate oak stand. Modern versions have digital displays featuring accurate strength read-outs, but you’re still just hitting a ball as hard as you can. Other strength testing machines include the Mr Muscle machine from Italian manufacturer Zamperla, which challenged you to arm wrestle with an intimidating plastic man.Crane grabberView image in fullscreen‘One wants a teddy’ … The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge play a crane grabber game at Island Leisure Amusement Arcade, Barry IslandPhotograph: Ben Birchall/PAAlso known as claw machines, these remain a staple arcade experience. You slot in a coin and use the joystick to direct an ineffectual grabber towards your desired toy. Usually, it makes a pathetic attempt before dropping the item millimetres away from the delivery chute (mostly because the clawscan be setto only grip at full strength for a minority of attempts). The first commercial example isthought to bethe Erie Digger manufactured in the US through the 1920s but since then well-known arcade manufacturers such as Sega and Bally have created their own examples, the former revolutionising the market in the 1980s with its UFO Catcher machines offering larger prizes and a brighter kawaii look. They remain irresistible.Light gun shooting galleriesLight gun shooting galleries were in every arcade in the 70s and 80s, but my favourite examples were the large installations featuring lifesize scenes to shoot at, often with a wild west, pirate or gangster theme. The one I most remember playing – I think in Blackpool’s Coral Island arcade – was calledHillybilly Moonshineand it had several mannequins dressed in overalls as well as a big copper distiller and various barrels and critters. If you hit the hillbillies they fired water pistols at you. You can still find these dotted about in surviving coin-op houses and they’re really worth a go.Coin pusherView image in fullscreenRecouping costs … a Penny Falls machine.Photograph: Alastair Balderstone/AlamyInvented by Ramsgate-based manufacturing firm Cromptons in 1966 (though there were earlier variants), coin push games are the kings of the seaside arcade, dominating the floor space and enticing players with their piles of sparkling treasure surely ready to fall at any second. The original was called Penny Falls, but there are hundreds of variations now, including virtual coin pushers, which move the action on to a screen with lots of special effects. Oh, the hours I spent during summer holidays wandering the arcades of Blackpool and Morecambe, a plastic cup of 2p coins in my hand, scrutinising these seductive machines. “Penny pushers are absolutely pivotal to the success of the British amusement arcade,” says lecturer and historian Alan Meades, author of Arcade Britannia: A Social History of the British Amusement Arcade. “Alongside the fruit machine they are where the arcades made their money – penny pushers could last for decades – retooled with currency changes – and recouped their costs time and again.”Explore more on these topicsGamesBeach holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the UN secretary general,António Guterres, struck an optimistic note in a recent speech in New York. The world, he said, “is on the cusp of a new era … The sun is rising on a clean energy age.” Pointing to falls in the cost of onshore wind and solar, and the risk of further gas-price shocks in future, he called on big technology companies – whose datacentres are one reason for soaring energy use – to adopt a target of 100% low-carbon electricity by 2030.Given US president Donald Trump’s personal hostility to renewable energy, Mr Guterres may be right that it makes more sense to demand action from US businesses at this point. In Scotland earlier this week, Mr Trump launched his latestmisleading tirade, urging European leaders to “stop the windmills”.His repeated attacks on wind power, as well as the recentcancellation of billions of dollars of green energy investment, make Mr Trump a destructive outlier. But populist parties in other countries are also ramping up their opposition to climate goals. In the UK, such positions were once confined to the political fringe. Now, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, is a net zero sceptic who has floated the possibility of a future government quitting the Paris agreement, while her acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie,accused the UN’s most senior climate scientists of bias.This disturbing shift rightly provoked astrong responsefrom the government. In July Ed Miliband called out Ms Badenoch’s party for its irresponsible and anti-science stance. With the UN’s deadline for countries to present their climate plans (known as nationally determined contributions) coming up, Mr Miliband deserves praise for his commitment. Climate diplomacy depends on politicians having the courage to face down opponents – and convince the public that a safe and secure energy future is within reach.This is the prospect held up by Mr Guterres, who hopes it will galvanise much-needed action. The goal, agreed two years ago, of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030, isnowhere near being reached. With the UN climate summit nearing, all eyes are onChina– the key player in the global renewables boom and the fight to stay within  climate limits.Internationally, and domestically, renewables are the right choice. Colonial rule saw Carbon Briefrankthe UK as the world’s fourth-largest historical emitter, behind only the US, China and Russia. To keep UK public support strong forgreen policies, energy ministers – notably Mr Miliband – must ensure awell-planned green transitionto bring down prices. Grids need upgrades to handle wind turbine growth. Supply chain bottlenecks and concerns abouthuman rightsin critical minerals mining must be addressed.In Britain, proposals from Labour MPs to reform energy billing – cutting costs for low-income households that use less power – aren’t just about loweringinflation. They raise a deeper question of fairness, and deserve serious attention as a step toward a more equal energy system, potentially through a social tariff. Ultimately, reforms should cut gas’s sway over electricity prices and couple optimism on renewables with honesty about the challenges.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Even so, Israel has become a Millwall among the nations, apparently unbothered by and impervious to the condemnation of a watching world – condemnation which this week gained serious momentum.As one country after another pointed an accusing finger towards Israel, repelled by the starvation, devastation and bloodshed it has brought down on Gaza, Israeli officials offered the now-familiar middle finger in return. When Keir Starmer announced Britain’s intention to recognise a state of Palestine, it was swiftly brushed aside by the deputy mayor of Jerusalem as “much ado about nothing”.There was a similarly dismissive reaction to both France’s earlier pledge to make the same diplomatic move andCanada’s announcement on Wednesdaythat it would follow suit. Sometimes, the register is studied insouciance, a shrug of the shoulders; sometimes it’s anger. But the message is consistent: we won’t budge. As the Israeli ambassador to Canada put it: “Israel will not bow to the distorted campaign of international pressure against it.”Yet for all the Shakespearean references, the “diplomatic tsunami” which Benjamin Netanyahu’s critics warned of for many years, and which now seems to have arrived, is not nothing. What’s more, and underneath the Millwall bluster, there are signs that Netanyahu knows it.More than140 of the 193 member statesof the UN had already recognised Palestine, but that club will soon include major western powers: the shift by France, the UK and Canada means no fewer than three members of the G7 are now on board. This same week saw a special conference convened at the UN in New York, where 125 countries urged Netanyahu to commit to the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, as they sought to resurrect the long-moribund two-state solution.All this diplomatic activity has prompted a series of objections from Israel and its defenders. First comes the claim that Israel’s critics are appeasers. WitnessNetanyahu’s tweeted riposte to Starmer, which included the line: “Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails.” Netanyahu often likes to invoke Winston Churchill and here he is again, casting himself as the Greatest Briton with Starmer as Neville Chamberlain, while hisforeign minister is full of talk of Munich and 1938. As if there is any analogy between Nazi Germany grabbing a chunk of Czechoslovakia and Palestinians seeking self-determination in their historical homeland. It’s a line of argument insulting in its ignorance.Next comes the charge that the likes of Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney are “rewarding terror”, handing Hamas a prize for the murderous series of atrocities it staged on 7 October 2023. But that’s an odd way to read what just happened. This week’s New York declaration, which was signed by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and the Arab League, explicitly condemns “the attacks committed by Hamas against civilians” on that day, the first such official denunciation by the Arab states.Moreover, the document is unambiguous that “Hamas must end its rule inGazaand hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority”. The same message comes through loud and clear in the declarations made by Starmer and his counterparts: it is the PA, currently led by Fatah, that they envisage as the recognised authority of a Palestinian state. The leaders can be faulted for failing to explain how this vision of theirs will be realised, but the vision itself is straightforward – and there is no place in it for Hamas. Hard to spin that as a “reward”.2:12Starmer says UK will recognise state of Palestine unless Israel meets conditions – videoMore forceful is the objection made by those campaigning for the release of the 20 Israeli hostages still believed to be held alive in Gaza. They argue that Starmer erred badly in suggesting that the UK would not go ahead with recognition of a Palestinian state if there were soon to be a ceasefire deal between Hamas andIsraelin Gaza. That, the campaigners argue, in effect incentivised Hamas torefuseto do any deal – which would have to include the freeing of at least some hostages – so that UK recognition goes ahead as promised.Starmer’s defenders believe this line of argument rests on a misunderstanding of Hamas. That group is not interested, they say, in a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza, living alongside Israel. Hamas is not in the two-state business, but rather seeks to rule over a single, jihadist state across the entire land, from the river to the sea.Indeed, given that the international community supported the principle of Palestinian independence before 7 October, to abandon it afterwards would itself be to reward Hamas, allowing that group to derail the two-state solution which it has been determined to sabotage since it first sent suicide bombers on to Israeli buses more than 30 years ago.More powerful still is the charge that these announcements and declarations are displacement activity, gestures that reveal nothing so much as the various governments’ impotence. There is something to that: diplomatic recognition will not feed a single child in Gaza. When Starmer’s various demands on Netanyahu are blithely ignored, it will only advertise the British PM’s weakness. In a way, the move this week tacitly recognises that reality. It is predicated on the notion that Israel continues to act in ways that make a two-state solution less viable. Previously, Starmer had always said he wanted to wait until UK recognition could play a part in an unfolding, meaningful peace process. Now he has acknowledged that there is no such thing, that he risked holding on to a card that was turning to dust in his hands. Better to play it now before it becomes entirely worthless. As Wes Streeting put it, the UK should recognise Palestine “while there is still a state of Palestine to recognise”.I lead a top Israeli human rights group. Our country is committing genocide | Yuli NovakRead moreThe hope in London, Paris and elsewhere is that, when the Gaza war eventually ends, the parameters of what should follow will already have been staked out. But, of course, Netanyahu is not listening. He made the decision long ago that Israel can ignore everybody – that the EU and the UN, along with every global institution from the World Health Organization to the BBC, can all be written off as hopelessly biased, if not bigoted – with only one exception: the US. Over the past decade or more, he has gone further, writing off half of the US too, choosing to ignore all Democrats and focus only on the Republican party. So long as Israel has the GOP’s backing, it’ll be fine.That has always been a reckless strategy and this week confirmed the danger of it. For one thing, Israel needs the support of more than one country. The EU and UK may not match the US as arms suppliers, but, economically, Israel needs them as trading partners, on favourable terms. Besides, the US Republican party is not a wholly reliable ally: a substantial wing of the Maga movement is hostile to Israel. (This week,Marjorie Taylor Greene became the first US lawmaker to accuse the country of genocide.) And Trump himself does not entirely share Netanyahu’s sweeping disregard for international opinion. He disdains it, but he also seeks its approval: he wants that Nobel prize.Steadily, the Israeli public is coming to see the price of the pariah status that Netanyahu has all but cultivated. A small portent is contained in thetrouble currently greeting Israeli tourists in Greece. That may be the best way to understand the vehemence with which Israeli officials sought to dismiss Starmer et al this week, insisting in loud, furious statements that they weren’t bothered at all. Increasing numbers of Israelis know they do not have the luxury of being Millwall: maybe no one likes them – but quite a lot of them care.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The medicine is just the latest in the far-reaching fallout from cuts made by the so-called “department of government efficiency,” or Doge, a project in which Elon Musk and a group of his very young,overwhelmingly maleacolytes unilaterally slashed congressionally appropriated funding to government programs they did not like. The cuts have been devastating for non-profits that work to improve women’s health and safety worldwide. Sarah Shaw, an associate director at the global family planning group MSI Reproductive Choices,saysthat the cuts will put women at risk as they strain their health with unplanned pregnancies and seek out illegal abortions; other women who are denied access to birth control will lose out on the opportunities for education, professional development or remunerative work that can help them escape abuse, rise out of poverty, pursue their talents and ambitions and better provide for the children they already have.Republicans wanted fewer abortions and more births. They are getting the opposite | Judith LevineRead moreWhen MSI attempted to buy the contraceptives, the administration would only accept full price, which the organization couldn’t afford, she said. Several non-profits, including MSI, had offered to pay to ship and repackage the supplies,according to another representative. But the Trump administration refused, partially due to federal rules the prohibit the US from providing such goods to groups that perform, provide referrals for or offer education about abortions. In addition to the cost of purchasing the contraceptives, American taxpayers will now be on the hook for about $167,000 for the cost of burning them.It’s just the latest in a series of signs that the Trump administration is turning against the provision of birth control, particularly the safe, effective and woman-controlled hormonal methods that have been a cornerstone of healthcare policy for decades and which were a precondition of women’s advancement in work and education over the past 60 years.In April, the Trump administration abruptly announced that it was suspending a large swath of the domestic service grants distributed under Title X, the program meant to help low-income Americans access birth control, STD treatment and other sexual and reproductive healthcare. Of the 86 Title X grants awarded for fiscal year 2024,nearly 25% were “temporarily withheld”, mostly based on highly suspect allegations that the grant-receiving institutions – including 13 Planned Parenthood affiliates – had failed to comply with Trump executive orders banning things like DEI programs.Eight statesnow receive zero Title X dollars: California, Hawaii, Maine, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee and Utah. Alaska, Minnesota and Pennsylvania have also lost most of their contraception funding.The domestic cuts – along with the exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from Medicaid reimbursements – mean that American women, too, are now facing dramatically greater obstacles to accessing birth control. Clinics that relied on Title X funding are now set to close: 11 Planned Parenthood clinicsalready have, including in Democratically controlled states like California. Planned Parenthood says that cumulatively, the cuts could lead the organization to close about 200 of its 600 clinics nationwide – a devastating cut to abortion providers in particular that will make a wide range of reproductive services inaccessible to women regardless of where they live.But the Trump administration is not merely forcing these programs for women’s health and dignity go up in flames. They are redirecting them to better suit their preferred cultural outcome: one in which women’s lives, ambitions and talents are all subordinated to the task of childbearing. The New York Times reportedlast monththat the White House is redirecting Title X funds that once went to birth control to instead fund an “infertility training center” and programs in something called “restorative reproductive medicine”. If Title X’s original aim was to help American women control their fertility so as to build healthier families and to enable them to pursue other aims – like learning or work – in the new administration’s version, the program exists mainly to encourage women to have more children. But the switch should not be seen as a genuine investment in infertility, an often devastating condition with which many Americans struggle. Because the new Title X priorities do not, by and large, direct more money to IVF. Trump promised, on the campaign trail, to make IVF free. But the procedure, which has opponents on the Christian right, is not included in the administration’s new priority of “restorative” reproductive medicine, a practice that avoids controversial fertility treatments; instead, doctors seek the “root cause” of a woman’s infertility, which may involve telling them they can conceive with proper diet and exercise.In government, money allocation is a statement of values. With its dramatic cuts to contraceptive funding at home and abroad, the Trump administration is making its values clear. It does not value women’s health; it does not value their dignity, their control over their own lives, their aspirations, their earning potential, their desire to be freed from ignorance, or poverty, or the abuse they suffer under the hands of husbands and fathers. It does not value their ability to control their own bodies, and by extension, it does not value their ability to enter the public sphere. It does not value their dreams, their gifts, their hard work or invention or aspiration to anything other than making babies. American women, like women everywhere, depend on birth control to live lives of freedom and to pursue their dreams. But because of the Trump administration, those dreams are going up in smoke.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS politicsAbortionContraception and family planningHealthWomencommentShareReuse this content"

AlthoughI have retired, I was scheduled to teach a large lecture course on this topic in the fall as a “special lecturer”, but I cannot do so under the conditions Columbia has accepted by capitulating to the Trump administration in June.Prominent historian cancels course at Columbia University over Trump dealRead moreSpecifically, it is impossible to teach this course (and much else) in light of Columbia’s adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. The IHRA definition deliberately, mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness withIsrael, so that any criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a criticism of Jews. Citing its potential chilling effect, a co-author of the IHRA definition, Professor Kenneth Stern, has repudiated its current uses. Yet Columbia has announced that it will serve as a guide in disciplinary proceedings.Under this definition of antisemitism, which absurdly conflates criticism of a nation-state, Israel, and a political ideology, Zionism, with the ancient evil of Jew-hatred, it is impossible with any honesty to teach about topics such as the history of the creation of Israel, and the ongoing Palestinian Nakba, culminating in the genocide being perpetrated by Israel inGazawith the connivance and support of the US and much of western Europe.The Armenian genocide, the nature of the absolute monarchies and military dictatorships that blight most of the Arab world, the undemocratic theocracy in Iran, the incipient dictatorial regime in Türkiye, the fanaticism of Wahhabism: all of these are subject to detailed analysis in my course lectures and readings. However, a simple description of the discriminatory nature of Israel’s 2018 Nation State Law – which states that only the Jewish people have the right of self-determination in Israel, half of whose subjects are Palestinian – or of the apartheid nature of its control over millions of Palestinians who have been under military occupation for 58 years would be impossible in a Middle East history course under the IHRA definition of antisemitism.Columbia’s capitulation has turned a university that was once a site of free inquiry and learning into a shadow of its former selfIt is not only faculty members’ academic freedom and freedom of speech that is infringed upon by Columbia’s capitulation to Trump’s diktat. Teaching assistants would be seriously constrained in leading discussion sections, as would students in their questions and discussions, by the constant fear that informers would snitch on them to the fearsome apparatus that Columbia has erected to punish speech critical of Israel, and to crack down on alleged discrimination – which at this moment in history almost invariably amounts simply to opposition to this genocide. Scores of students and many faculty members have been subjected to these kangaroo courts, students such as Mahmoud Khalil have been snatched from their university housing, and Columbia has now promised to render this repressive system even more draconian and opaque.You have stated that no “red lines” have been crossed by these decisions. However, Columbia has appointed a vice-provost initially tasked with surveilling Middle Eastern studies, and it has ordained that faculty and staff must submit to “trainings” on antisemitism from the likes of the Anti-Defamation League, for whom virtually any critique of Zionism or Israelis antisemitic, and Project Shema, whose trainings link manyanti-Zionist critiques to antisemitism. It has accepted an “independent” monitor of “compliance” of faculty and student behavior from a firm that in June 2025 hosted an event in honor of Israel. According toColumbia’s agreementwith the Trump administration, this “Monitor will have timely access to interview all Agreement-related individuals, and visit all Agreement-related facilities, trainings, transcripts of Agreement-related meetings and disciplinary hearings, and reviews”. Classrooms are pointedly NOT excluded from possible visits from these external non academics.The idea that the teaching, syllabuses and scholarship of some of the most prominent academics in their fields should be vetted by such a vice-provost, such “trainers” or an outside monitor from such a firm is abhorrent. It constitutes the antithesis of the academic freedom that you have disingenuously claimed will not be infringed by this shameful capitulation to the anti-intellectual forces animating theTrump administration.I regret deeply that Columbia’s decisions have obliged me to deprive the nearly 300 students who have registered for this popular course – as many hundreds of others have done for more than two decades – of the chance to learn about the history of the modern Middle East this fall. Although I cannot do anything to compensate them fully for depriving them of the opportunity to take this course, I am planning to offer a public lecture series in New York focused on parts of this course that will be streamed and available for later viewing. Proceeds, if any, will go to Gaza’s universities, every one of which has been destroyed by Israel with US munitions, a war crime about which neither Columbia nor any other US university has seen fit to say a single word.Columbia’s capitulation has turned a university that was once a site of free inquiry and learning into a shadow of its former self, an anti-university, a gated security zone with electronic entry controls, a place of fear and loathing, where faculty and students are told from on high what they can teach and say, under penalty of severe sanctions. Disgracefully, all of this is being done to cover up one of the greatest crimes of this century, the ongoing genocide in Gaza, a crime in which Columbia’s leadership is now fully complicit.– Rashid KhalidiRashid Khalidi is the Edward Said professor emeritus of modern Arab studies atColumbia Universityand author of The Hundred Years’ War on PalestineExplore more on these topicsColumbia UniversityOpinionGazaIsraelAntisemitismWest BankPalestinian territoriesTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer would dismiss him as a nimby, but on this Trump has a pointFri 1 Aug 2025 05.32 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 05.54 EDTShareTrigger warning. Some readers may find this disturbing. Not everything Donald Trump says is mad and a lie. Not all of itis about money. Some of it iseven worth saying. When he came to office, one of Trump’s first actions was extraordinary. He directed his fire at what he saw as the ugliness of American architecture.He demandedthat at least federal buildings should be “visually identifiable as civic buildings, and respect regional, traditional, and classical architectural heritage in order to uplift and beautify public spaces and ennoble the United States”. All plans had to be submitted to Washington for his approval.There was more than an element of psychological obsession in such bureaucracy. American classicism – born of an admiration for France’s republicans – was a cult throughout the 19th century. The White House was based on a Dublin mansion. This weekit was announcedthat it is to get what it has always lacked, a sumptuous new ballroom in which to receive and entertain foreign dignitaries. It is to be classical, with no nonsense about trying to make it look modern. That a president should seek to revive both regional and European style in the face of America’s relentless modernism is a breath of fresh air.That aesthetic interest extends to landscape. Trump left Scotland this week clearly still seething over the wind turbines waving over his coastal Turnberry and Aberdeen golf courses. At Turnberry eight tower over a hill inland. The president cannot avoid the sight of wind turbines. “Ugly as hell”, “monstrosities”, “so noisy and so dangerous”, and a threat to “Scotland’s tourism industry”,he has described them.Turnberry has lost Trumptens of millions of poundsover the decade since he bought it, but he loves golf and his mother’s home country of Scotland. The course also has the most exquisite view over an old lighthouse to the prominent island of Ailsa Craig across the water. There is no question: the turbines spoil the setting.Whatever Trump says about wind power killing birds and driving whales mad – most of it rubbish – there is no denying that about 4,000 giant turbines are now desecrating Scotland’s in-shore waters.There is no signof any Scottish politician showing the slightest concern for their visual impact. The chief consideration is a turbine’sproximity to the grid, in other words profit. The price has been a real loss of wildness in Scotland’s once-glorious islands.Trump may be wrong to deride the value of renewable energy, and he may talk nonsense about other evils of turbines. But he is not wrong to demand that we should consider how and where to locate them.He pleads thatin the US they are “killing the beauty of our scenery, our valleys, our beautiful plains”, and he is right. From what I have seen in California, turbines are located without a thought for their scenic impact.The reality is that I cannot recall a single British minister who would these days mention scenic beauty as a consideration in any area of policy, be it energy or planning or transportation. A generation ago, few in Britain would likewise have dared to complain about the building of ugly petrol stations in open country, where most now lie empty and derelict. So now no one – other than Trump – dares complain about turbines. Generally sent well offshore by the Cameron government in the 2010s, they are now to return onshore,enticed by the energy secretaryEd Miliband’s crazy subsidies.Ed Miliband would let a turbine farm destroy Brontë country.

He announcedhe would take overfrom New York’s transport authority the future of its notoriously grim Penn Station, the original having been demolished in 1963. An adventurous plan had been hatched during his first term by his president of the Commission of Fine Arts, Justin Shubow. It was for a return to the station’s neoclassical forerunner, widely regarded as the US’s finest terminus and partner to the majestic Grand Central up the road.In April Trump duly appointed the federal rail operator Amtrakto revive Shubow’s projectwith a price tag of $7.5bn. Its majesty is to rise again on the initiative of a president eager to demonstrate stylistic taste in the American public sector. Eat your heart out Liverpool Street; get lost Euston.Clearly there is a limit to what Trump can change in just four years in office. Much of what he does is psychodrama and playacting. The president with whom he is becoming comparable is Teddy Roosevelt after 1900. He too tested the limits of presidential power. He too was frantic to lead the daily news agenda. But he too seemed to care about America’s natural environment, its forests and deserts, and a role for Washington in their custodianship.To show aesthetic sensitivity is today regarded as a weakness in a politician. Breathe the words art, conservation or natural beauty in the presence of Keir Starmer and you are dismissed as a nimby.Where Trump ends up leading his country and the western world may well prove alarming. It is certainly impossible to predict. But I find it refreshing to have a leader unashamed to talk of beauty and ugliness. I like him being ready to debate style. Above all, I welcome him calling out a scenic abomination when he sees one.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yet much of it is based on misinformationGeorge Billinge is a former Ofcom policy managerFri 1 Aug 2025 11.22 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 12.28 EDTShareLast week, the UK’s Online Safety Act came into force. It’s fair to say it hasn’t been smooth sailing. Donald Trump’s allies have dubbed it the “UK’s online censorship law”, and the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, added fuel to the fire by claiming that Nigel Farage’s opposition to the act put him “on the side” of Jimmy Savile.Disdain from the right isn’t surprising. After all, tech companies will now have to assess the risk their platforms pose of disseminating the kind of racistmisinformation that fuelledlast year’s summer riots.What has particularly struck me, though, is the backlash from progressive quarters. Online outlet Novara Media published an interview claiming the Online Safety Actcompromises children’s safety. Politics Joe joked that the act involves “banning Pornhub”. New YouGov polling shows that Labour voters areeven less likelyto support age verification on porn websites than Conservative or Liberal Democrat voters.I helped draft Ofcom’s regulatory guidance setting out how platforms should comply with the act’s requirements on age verification. Because of the scope of the act and theabsenceof a desire to force tech platforms to adopt specific technologies, this guidance was broad and principles-based – if the regulator prescribed specific measures, it would be accused of authoritarianism. Taking a principles-based approach is more sensible and future proof, but does allow tech companies to interpret the regulation poorly.Despite these challenges, I am supportive of the principles of the act.As someone with progressive politics, I have always been deeply concerned about the impact of an unregulated online world. Bad news abounds: X allowing racist misinformation to spread in the name of “free speech”; and children being radicalised or being targeted byonline sexual extortion. It was clear to me that these regulations would start to move us away from a world in which tech billionaires could dress up self-serving libertarianism as lofty ideals.Instead, a culture war has erupted that is laden with misunderstanding, with every poor decision made by tech platforms being blamed on regulation. This strikes me as incredibly convenient for tech companies seeking to avoid accountability.So what does theact actually do? In short, it requires online services to assess the risk of harm – whether illegal content such as child sexual abuse material, or, in the case of services accessed by children, content such as porn or suicide promotion – and implement proportionate systems to reduce those risks.It’s also worth being clear about what isn’tnew. Tech companies have been moderating speech and taking down content they don’t want on their platforms for years. However, they have done so based on opaque internal business priorities, rather than in response to proactive risk assessments.Let’s look at some examples. After the Christchurch terror attack in New Zealand, which was broadcast in a 17-minute Facebook Live post and shared widely by white supremacists, Facebook trained its AI toblock violent live streams. More recently, after Trump’s election, Meta overhauled itsapproach to content moderationand removed factchecking in the US, a move which its own oversight board has criticised as being too hasty.Rather than making decisions to remove content reactively, or in order to appease politicians, tech companies will now need to demonstrate they have taken reasonable steps to prevent this content from appearing in the first place. The act isn’t about “catching baddies”, or taking down specific pieces of content. Where censorship has happened, such as the suppression of pro-Palestine speech, this has been taking placelong before the implementationof the Online Safety Act.Where public interest content is being blocked as a result of the act, we should be interrogating platforms’ risk assessments and decision-making processes, rather than repealing the legislation. Ofcom’s new transparency powers make this achievable in a way that wasn’t possible before.Yes, there are some flaws with the act, and teething issues will persist. As someone who worked on Ofcom’s guidance on age verification, even I am slightly confused by the waySpotify is checkingusers’ ages. The widespread adoption of VPNs to circumvent age checks on porn sites is clearly something to think about carefully. Where should age assurance be implemented in a user journey? And who should be responsible for informing the public that many age assurance technologies delete all of their personal data after their age is confirmed, while some VPN providers sell their information to data brokers? But the response to these issues shouldn’t be to repeal the Online Safety Act: it should be for platforms to hone their approach.Worried about your child’s screentime? Get a landline | Emma BrockesRead moreThere is an argument that the problem ultimately lies with the business models of the tech industry, and that this kind of legislation will never be able to truly tackle that. The academic Shoshana Zuboff calls this “surveillance capitalism”: tech companies get us hooked through addictive design and extract huge amounts of our personal data in order to sell us hyper-targeted ads. The result is a society characterised by atomisation, alienation and the erosion of our attention spans. Because the easiest way to get us hooked is to show us extreme content, children are directed from fitness influencers to content promoting disordered eating. Add to this the fact that platforms are designed to make people expand their networks and spend as much time on them as possible, and you have a recipe for disaster.Again, it’s a worthy critique. But we live in a world where American tech companies hold more power than many nation states – and they have a president in the White House willing tostart trade warsto defend their interests.So yes, let’s look at drafting regulation that addresses addictive algorithms and support alternative business models for tech platforms, such as data cooperatives. Let’s continue to explore how best to provide children with age-appropriate experiences online, and think about how to get age verification right.But while we’re working on that, really serious harms are taking place online. We now have a sophisticated regulatory framework in the UK that forces tech platforms to assess risk and allows the public to have far greater transparency over their decision-making processes. We need critical engagement with the regulation, not cynicism. Let’s not throw out the best tools we have.George Billinge is a former Ofcom policy manager and is CEO of tech consultancy Illuminate TechDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There are distinctions between “organic wine” and “wine made with organic grapes,” but at the heart of the matter is non-chemical farming.Organic farmers manage insects, weeds, and disease through methods that are labor-intensive but less environmentally destructive.Soiland plant life is prioritised over commercialism. Not only do these organic approaches hold environmental benefits, but in general, organic viticulture is considered key for healthy grapes and great wine.How is it better for the environment?Organic vineyards not only avoid many of the environmental problems caused by viticulture, but form part of the effort to reverse those problems. This also applies to “regenerative” and “biodynamic” winegrowing, two distinct but related approaches which have organic farming as their basis.Like most commercial crops, grapevines are susceptible to disease and insect infestation. To deal with these threats, conventional viticulture relies on pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides.An eco-friendly renovation doesn’t need to be all about appliances and it needn’t cost the EarthRead moreOrganic viticulture permits the usage of two primary treatments: copper and sulfur, which are applied primarily for anti-fungal benefits. Some viticulturalists, including in the biodynamic movement, opt to treat vines with plant-based sprays such as nettle or yarrow, with the goal being overall vine health and resilience.Organic farmers embrace two methods of weed management that have the added bonus of carbon sequestration and soil improvement: cover crop planting between vine rows, and no or reduced-tillage.Instead of managing weeds through herbicide, organic growers sow cover crops such as peas, lupins, or clover between vine rows. These fix nitrogen in the soil, enhancing exposure to light and providing nutrients for microbes within, and they also generate more “organic matter” within the soil. “Organic matter” refers to humus in soil—the nutrient-rich stuff that makes soil fertile. Cover crops can break down and become organic matter, enhancing soil.Tilling the soil is a known way to release carbon into the atmosphere. Organic farming avoids this by building soil up through cover crops, compost, mulch, and other forms of organic matter, preserving carbon instead of releasing it.How does it affect the taste?South Australian winegrower Frewen Ries, who co-owns CRFT Wines in the Adelaide Hills, converted his vineyard to organic after buying it from conventional farmers in 2013.“When we took over, the soil under the vines was devoid of grass,” he says. “It had been sprayed with herbicide. You could knock on it and it was rock-hard. It was essentially hydrophobic, it didn’t soak up any water.”How to reduce your food footprint: if it’s better for you, it’s better for the planetRead moreRies and his partner decided to let grass grow under the vines and to not till the soil. Over time, they saw a build-up of topsoil and the wines developed more complexity.“We’ve done vertical tastings recently of our Pinot Noir to when we first produced it off the block in 2013, and we found a dramatic increase in colour and depth,” says Ries.Creating a stronger, more resilient cropWhile some insects can damage vines in the short term, organic farming prioritises a diverse ecosystem over crop capitalisation.A flourishing ecosystem leads to what’s known as “dynamic equilibrium” and “biological control”– a situation where plants and microbial life balance each other out when competing for resources, and “living things control an outbreak of a pest,” according to anorganic farming manualprovided by the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia (NASAA).When plants, microbes, insects and animals are in harmony, there is less need for intervention and the crop will be overall stronger and more resilient.What should I look for when buying?Look for the “organic wine” or “natural wine” section at bottleshops, or ask them if they have oneHead to any self-described “natural wine” shop, where some bottles may not be from certified organic vineyards, but in general producers represented will be farming organically or regeneratively, while also bottling their wine with low levels of sulfur dioxide (a preservative) and minimal or no filtrationLook for certifications – in Australia, NASAA is commonly used for winegrowing; certified organic European Union wines (and foods) display a green leaf iconWine is a luxury that we are lucky to enjoy. If we can put our money behind responsibly farmed vineyards, we’re steering the wine market toward better practices and creating a significant cumulative difference in the world.Explore more on these topicsWineChange by degreesAustralian food and drinkFood & drink industrySoilOrganicsEthical and green livingexplainersShareReuse this content"

But for all those who have ears to hear and eyes to see, there can be little doubt that the Israeli government is committing genocide in Gaza, slaughtering and starving civilians after systematically destroying all the infrastructure in the territory. In the meantime, settlers and the Israeli army are every day guilty of serious, massive and repeated violations of international law and international humanitarian law in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.Those who do not act to stop this genocide and these violations of international law, even though they have the power to do so, are complicit in them. This is unfortunately the case with the leaders of the European Union and those of its member states, who refuse to sanction Israel even though the EU has alegal obligationto do so.The EU has many levers it could pull to exert significant influence on the Israeli government. The EU is Israel’s biggest trading partner and its main partner in investment and people-to-people exchange. It is also one of its major arms suppliers. Theassociation agreementbetween the EU and Israel, established in 2000 after the Oslo accords, is the most favourable of all those concluded by the bloc with third countries. In addition to zero customs duties on its exports of goods and services and visa-free travel for its citizens, the agreement gives Israel access to several major European funding and exchange programmessuch as Horizonand Erasmus.However, article 2 of this agreement makes it conditional on Israel’s respect for international law and fundamental human rights. Whether or not to suspend it is therefore not a choice that the EU can make at will. Since the EU foreign affairs ministers found that Israel was not respecting these rights, EU leaders now have a legal obligation to suspend the agreement. Failure to do so would also be a serious violation of the association agreement with Israel.However, despite all my efforts to this end when I was high representative of the EU, and despite the dramatic deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the increasing violations of international law in the West Bank in recent months, the EU and most EU governments have so far failed to use any of the levers available to them to exert pressure on the Israeli government.As a result, faced with the intransigence of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, the EU has for more than a year and a half been unable to assert its commitment to fundamental human rights, its defence of international law and multilateralism, or its longstanding position in favour of the two-state solution. This inaction has already seriously damaged its geopolitical standing, not only in the Muslim world but across the globe. The stark contrast between the firm response of the European authorities to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and their passivity in the face of the war in Gaza has been widely exploited by Vladimir Putin’s propaganda against the EU. And with success, as we have seen in particularin the Sahel. This European double standard has also greatly weakened support for Ukraine in many developing countries.By persisting in not suspending the association agreement despite its clear violation by Israel, in not blocking arms deliveries to that country despite the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza, in not banning imports from illegal settlements despite the decisions of the international court of justice to that effect, by not sanctioning Israeli ministers and political leaders who make genocidal statements, by not banning Netanyahu from using European airspace despite the arrest warrant issued by the international criminal court, and by not supporting the judges of the court and UN officials sanctioned by the United States, the EU and its member states are discrediting themselves in the eyes of the world and undermining the international law and multilateral order they are supposed to defend. While under attack from Putin in the east and Trump in the west, the EU is thus deepening its isolation by cutting itself off from the rest of the world.The leaders of the EU and its member states will probably be called to account in the future for their complicity in the crimes against humanity committed by Netanyahu’s government. And, with hindsight, Europeans will undoubtedly judge harshly their blindness to the genocide that is taking place. However, it is urgent to limit the damage now. The EU must finally decide to sanction Israel without further delay. This is the only language that can bring Israeli leaders to stop committing crimes against humanity.Josep Borrell was the high representative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy from 2019 to 2024.

That’s how it felt watching England’s Lionesses romping gleefully across the pitch after their victory in Basel – not just because they won but because of the way they did it, with an exuberance and a resilience and an obvious love of playing together that makes them irresistible to watch. That 65,000 people came out in the drizzle for theirhomecoming paradedown the Mall was testament not just to the deserved new popularity of women’s football but also to the longing for a national event that, even if only briefly, made us feel cheerful, expansive, as if all things were possible.So it’s interesting that for hersummer beach readingRachel Reeves pickedAbundance, the American journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s blueprint for the more permanent rebuilding of hope and joy. It’s a pro-growth,techno-optimist rallying cryfor progressives to reinvent themselves as purveyors of plenty and good times in contrast to the right’s crabby, mean-spirited “scarcity mindset” – which revolves around the belief that there isn’t enough good stuff to go round and therefore the priority is snatching it back off immigrants or the poor or whatever bewildered former ally Donald Trump accuses ofripping America off.Klein and Thompson argue convincingly that for decades western consumers have been fobbed off with an abundance of stuff we fleetingly want – fast fashion, cheap flights, more streamed content than anyone has time to watch – but a paucity of stuff we actually need, such as affordable homes near where the good jobs are, or cheap green energy. Where the authors will divide the room, however, is by claiming that’s partly down to years of liberal politicians attaching well-meaning strings to public building projects, from environmental protections to procurement rules to US zoning laws for housing, which although noble in intent collectively make it impossible to build. It was Reeves’s jolting recent description of red tape as a “boot on the neck” of business that first made me wonder if she’d read the fervently deregulatory Abundance. Though it focuses on the California housing crisis, there are enough relatable stories – the nimby neighbours fighting affordable homes because they’d prefer more car parking, or the decades wasted failing to build a high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and San Francisco – for it to have done the rounds at Westminster andamong Australian progressivestoo.Like all snappy bestsellers, it’s sometimes glib. Klein and Thompson talk a great game about facing up to reality – if you can’t have speedy housebuildingandgenerous protection for bat andnewt habitats, say, which do you want most? – yet place enormous faith in the magical ability of still-unproven technologies to solve problems without creating new ones. Their vision of a utopia involving driverless cars, lab-grown meat and bounteous vegetable crops from so-called vertical farms (essentially giant greenhouses powered by renewable energy) would sound more convincing if it weren’t forhorror stories about autonomous drivingor the struggle to makevertical farmingremotely viable in Britain. But there’s something undeniably appealing at its heart.Plenty is an innately American idea, at home in the land of bottomless refills and vast open skies and permanently reaching after more, bigger, better. But from a British left perspective, what’s interesting is its relationship with altruism. Scarcity makes people selfish, anxious, distrusting of others and prone to hoarding whatever they’ve got: think of shoppers fighting over loo rolls in lockdown. But in times of abundance, we relax, becoming more generous.Klein and Thompson’s proposals for a 21st-century era of plenty – build lots of affordable housing and prioritise super-cheap clean energy to lower household bills and unleash industrial innovation – aren’t exactly revelatory to a Labour government already committed to most of this (though in Britain some might add the need toreform an electricity marketwhere prices are still artificially pegged to gas). What Labour hasn’t yet nailed, however, is the emotional framing that turns rather worthy but dull-sounding infrastructure projects into the genuinely exciting makings of a better life.Abundance by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson review – make America build againRead moreSomewhere in abundance theory are the glimmerings of a story that brings together otherwise disparate policies and people. What Ed Miliband and Angela Rayner, the two natural abundance politicians on the cabinet’s soft left, share with those on the technocratic right like chief AI cheerleader Peter Kyle, is mostly a mindset: an ebullience, an enthusiasm, and a refusal to see everything as hopeless that matters to progressive parties, because they’re in the business of hope. Never more so, arguably, than when the right is deep in the business of doom.Nigel Farage’s great appeal to his followers used to be the fact that he liked a drink and a laugh; that he was so obviously enjoying himself. But lately his party has begun to sound bitter, nihilistic, oddly hysterical. Claiming that Britain is on the verge ofsocietal collapseplays well on X, already awash with nonsense aboutno-go zonesin Birmingham and civil war in Europe, but perhaps less well in daylight. Britain has big problems, many of them deep seated. But it’s still a country where people wash their cars in suburban driveways on a Sunday afternoon, not apost-apocalyptic wastelandwhere we’re all one step away from barbecuing rats for supper. There’s undeniably a market for politicians wallowing angrily in dreams of a better yesterday. But I suspect there’s still a bigger one, out there in the rain, waiting to catch sight of a better tomorrow.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionHousingEnergy efficiencyRachel ReevesNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Its leadership, its launch schedule and even its name: all havecaused inconclusive, semi-public rows. The opportunity provided by political novelty appears to be being wasted.For the many journalists and politicians who always see the left as incompetent and naive, the stop-start, seemingly uncoordinated first weeks ofYour Party, as it may or may not eventually be named, have felt like a gift – a summer silly season story after months of grim political acrimony. “Thank Christ Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana are here to give us a laugh,” wrote Sebastian Murphy in the Daily Express. “Labour’s loopy Left have bravely broken free of Starmer’s stultification to bring us a political party that is easily the funniest thing since the anti-Brexit centrists Change UK.” Now largely forgotten, Change UK lasted 10 months after splitting from Labour in 2019.For left-leaning Britons who’ve had enough of Labour’s rightward shifts and intolerance of dissent, and have been hoping for a viable alternative, the new party’s launch has been depressing. Why, in times which so obviously require a radical fightback, can’t the left agree a clear way forward? Why is it still so dependent on Corbyn, who after 42 years in parliament can hardly be presented as a fresh figure? And where are the nimble strategists that the immensely difficult task of establishing a successful leftwing party is going to need?Some of the answers to these questions, which British leftists often ask each other with despairing shrugs and eye-rolls, lie in socialism’s struggles in this country since the 1980s. These have left the movement with gaps and imbalances, which are exposed whenever it tries to take the initiative.Yet as well as considering these weaknesses, it’s also important to acknowledge that, despite all the confusion and ridicule, Corbyn and Sultana’s new party has struck a nerve. It says that more than 600,000 people have signed up on its rudimentary website for updates and information about how to get involved – almost as many people as the memberships of Labour, the Tories and Reform UK combined. In some of the most hostile coverage of the new party, there is a revealing note of alarm. “Something has actually gone seriously wrong with British society,” wrote Camilla Tominey in the Telegraph, “if a party such as this could poll at 18 per cent” – theproportion who told YouGovthey would “consider” voting for a new Corbyn-led party. “It’s a rebellion against the broken status quo.”Superficially, this rebellion seems little different from the half dozen that have tried and failed to break Labour’s left-of-centre monopoly over the past 30 years: Respect, Left Unity, the Workers party of Britain, the Socialist party, the Socialist Labour party, the London Socialist Alliance. Well-known leftists such as Arthur Scargill and George Galloway attempted to turn strong local power bases, personal charisma and leftwing credibility into something bigger, at times when Labour was alienating its more radical supporters. A few parliamentary and council seats were won, but rarely for long. The new parties were both too narrow – dominated by one person – and too broad – prone to ideological differences – to sustain their initial momentum. With their ageing figureheads and traditional leftwing sectarianism, the new parties did not seem new enough.This time, the involvement of Sultana, one of the most digitally fluent young MPs, sends a different signal. So does the involvement of innovative and ambitious political operators, such as Momentum co-founder James Schneider, who helped make Corbyn’s Labour leadership, at times, surprisingly dynamic and popular– despite it being widely written off, as the new party is now. Six years on from Corbynism’s defeat, there is finally a movement, largely undetected by the mainstream media, of bright, youngish leftwing activists back into the political game.And yet, as the frictions between Corbyn and Sultana have shown, it remains tricky to unite two leftwing generations, very different in age and levels of political patience – while also appealing more effectively to middle-aged Britons, who grew up under New Labour and often absorbed its centrist assumptions. These difficulties afflicted Corbyn’s Labour leadership, and ultimately helped destroy it.The British left has so often been excluded from power over the past 40 years that it frequently lacks the skills that experience of power can bring: building and sustaining coalitions, maintaining message discipline, creating political organisations that are representative without being too fractious. Truly leftwing British parties, in short, tend to be a bit rickety, yet they must stand up against our conservative political culture’s strongest winds.Then again, such deficiencies may matter less nowadays. The deep discontent and many crises left by 14 years of rightwing rule, impatience with Starmer’s methodical but patchy reforms, and outrage at his government’s Gaza evasions, mean that many voters are in an adventurous – or reckless – mood. A radical party with a highly divisive leader, thrown-together structure and frequent internal rows already exists, and it’s called Reform. Its poll lead suggests that voters are less interested than journalists in party processes, and more interested in stories about what’s wrong with Britain, compellingly told. Whether at rallies or on social media, Sultana and Corbyn are just as capable of this as Nigel Farage. A new poll shows that Reform voters stronglyprefer Corbyn to Starmer, which suggests that the new party could take Reform votes.Labour focused on appeasing Reform, not beating them, says Jeremy CorbynRead moreReform has more media backing than the new party ever will. Yet it’s likely that rightwing journalists will keep giving the leftwing party publicity, and even some favourable coverage, in order to hurt Labour. So the new party will need to pull off a balancing act: keeping its personalities and factions happy, developing populist but not fantastical policies, and wounding the government without helping Farage into Downing Street.Labour loyalists will say that a left divided is a left defeated. But if they truly believed that, Starmer’s party and government would be much more pluralist. What these loyalists really think is that the left should only ever be divided on their terms. That entitled and coercive logic has now had consequences. A new leftwing party, risky and imperfect, could be here to stay. This time, it’s possible that our politics will never be quite the same again.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsJeremy CorbynOpinionZarah SultanaLabourSocialismcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s left us burnt out, broke and dreaming of a rich patronCarolin WürfelBy my age, my German boomer parents had kids, a house, a car, a garden. All I have is a nervous feeling whenever I open my banking appFri 1 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 06.13 EDTShareAcouple of weeks ago, I came across an Amy Poehler joke in which she sums up thedifferent generational experiences of money: “Boomers are all about money. Gen X is like: ‘Is it all about money?’ Millennials ask: ‘Where is the money?’ And gen Z is like: ‘What is money?’”It made me laugh – but it also hit a nerve. It felt painfully accurate and oddly comforting. Maybe it’s not just me. I’m a millennial, and financial insecurity has been a theme in my life for a while. But recently, it’s grown louder, and I literally can’t stop asking: “WHERE IS THE GODDAMN MONEY?”I used to ask nicely. After all, I was raised to be a grateful, polite millennial – the kind who believed that magic always happens outside your comfort zone and therefore did unpaid internships in her 20s and sent thank-you emails after being underpaid. But no more. Hence the capital letters. I’m raging.Maybe it’s because I’m approaching 40. Maybe it’s because I keep comparing myself with my parents, who by this age had two kids, a car, a house, a garden and three holidays a year.I’m not just raging. After 15 years of working non-stop, I’m exhausted. And there are days when I ask myself: is it really meant to be this way – or am I just failing? Am I simply not grownup enough when it comes to money?I knew the facts about millennials but I wasn’t ready to admit the life my parents had would never be mine | Miles HerbertRead moreI know the answer isn’t that simple – or that harsh. Because usually, after days spent examining my shortcomings, I also think: no, this can’t just be personal failure. Maybe the odds were never in my favour.Millennial women like myself were told to work hard and follow our passion. Because if you work hard and find something you’re good at, it’ll pay off. It doesn’t, though. The path I’ve chosen – creative, independent – offers very little in the way of long-term security and when I look around, a pattern emerges.Over dinner recently with three friends – two men and one woman, all about my age – we started talking about money worries. The woman, a talented sculptor, said she had been feeling deeply anxious. She thought it was partly hormones, but more than that, it was existential. She was considering retraining, maybe going into teaching – anything to build a more stable life. At one point, she turned to me and asked: “How do you do it?” I said: “I juggle three things at once.”Meanwhile, the two men nodded sympathetically. They work in the arts – but both have full-time jobs and permanent contracts. One just bought a plot of land. The other has tenure. The women are freelancers. The men are secure. Is it our fault? Couldn’t we just do what they did?I don’t think so. Our economic system doesn’t just undervalue women’s work. It depends on it. It relies on our flexibility, our unpaid labour, our creative output, our willingness to “make it work”. It assumes women will absorb the risk, subsidise culture and care with their own time, energy and savings. In creative industries, this is especially stark: women are expected to be grateful to be there at all. To work “for exposure”, for the opportunity – not the paycheque. And that gratitude has kept us quiet, compliant – and broke.This is no accident – it’s systemic. In Germany, women across all age groups earn less, save less and live longer. If you’re single and self-employed, you’re automatically walking a financial tightrope with no net and you’ll likely belong to the 70% of working women todaywho are at risk of poverty in old age. (Recent data from the German Federal Statistical Office reports that the gender gap in retirementincome amounts to 29.9%.)I can’t believe I’m saying this out loud, but it feels like the only safety net is a rich spouse.When I told my friend a few days ago that I prefer dating artists, she threw up her hands: “No! You need to find a hedge fund manager!” I thought of that meme – “I’m looking for a man in finance” – and rolled my eyes. But she wasn’t wrong. Awealthy and steady partneris the most reliable pension plan for many women.I don’t want a husband, though. What I secretly long for is a patron. The 18th-century kind. Someone who says: “I believe in your work. Go write. Don’t worry about anything.” Or, more realistically: universal basic income. And a proper educational system for the next generation of women. One that teaches them how to handle money, so they don’t fall into the same trap.Seriously: can someone explain to me why we didn’t learn about compound interest, mortgages, tax brackets and pensions in school? Isn’t financial literacy a basic part of education, if the goal is to raise well-equipped adults?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve built a body of work I’m proud of. And yet, I still get nervous opening my banking app. Still avoid deep financial talk. Still don’t fully understand the German tax system.I fell for the silly belief that talking about money is obscene.Sometimes I want to slap myself for not having made smarter choices. For not having planned, protected myself by investing or talking to experts. Instead, I kept dreaming about a life filled with interesting encounters, stories, intellectually stimulating conversations.And honestly, there’s still a part of me that cherishes that softness. To be a European millennial now – in our late 30s – means witnessing the erosion of the ideals we grew up with, yet still holding on to something tender. Maybe naive. Maybe vital. We were promised a lot and trained for little. And perhaps this vulnerability – this capacity to imagine a different, less materialistic world – is not only a weakness. It might be a strength, of a playful sort.In Istanbul, my current place of residence, people buy gold. I own some gold jewellery – some pieces were gifts, others inherited. I don’t like most of them and rarely wear them. But with gold prices soaring, I’ve been looking at them differently. Gold is finite, after all, which means it keeps its value. Unlike stocks.My plan: take these items to a friend in theGrand Bazaarwho deals in gold. There’s something almost magical about the idea of turning my few rings and necklaces into gold plaques – a quiet stash I can cash in quickly, to be kept in a velvet pouch that would look like a fairytale treasure chest. A reminder of how much I’m still clinging to a world of fantasy.And maybe that’s the whole trick. Keep going. Keep improvising. Because our boomer parents told us to follow our passion. And now? We’re melting down our jewellery.Carolin Würfel is a writer, screenwriter and journalist who lives in Berlin and Istanbul.

Unfortunately the grim statistics tell a different storyGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastThu 31 Jul 2025 23.06 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 03.12 EDTShareIf I were president of the United States, I would certainly be concerned about the cost and performance of the country’s healthcare system. The grim statistics are well known. As of 2022, the US spent $12,555 per person on healthcare, almost twice as much as other wealthy countries, including Australia. That gap alone cancels out about half of the difference in income per person between the US and Australia, according to World Bank estimates.Higher expenditure on healthcare would not be a problem if it delivered a healthier population. But this is not the case. The US has one of thelowest life expectanciesof any rich country. And even though more Americans die young, those who survive have worse health than elsewhere. Americans suffer from chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma and depression at aroundtwice the (age-adjusted) rateof other rich countries.Trump accuses foreign nations of ‘freeloading’ on drug prices as Australia insists PBS prices won’t riseRead moreThis gap is too large to be accounted for by specific causes like gun violence or drug overdoses, or even unequal income distribution. The US has worse health outcomesat every point on the income distribution scalethan other rich countries, even though those at the upper end have much higher incomes.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAnd the problem is getting worse. The US saw declining life expectancy in the years after 2014 and, unlike other countries, saw a late, limited recovery from the increased death rate after the onset of the Covid pandemic.There’s not much hope for rapid progress in US health outcomes. The destruction of US public health infrastructure through budget cuts, the gutting of key agencies such as the Center for Disease Control and the appointment of notorious anti-vaxxer RFK Jr as secretary of health and human services will only make matters worse.It’s unsurprising then that President Donald Trump is looking at the cost side of the equation. As might be expected he has raised, again, the perennial grievances of US health policy. This is the fact that Americans pay far more for prescription medicines than do citizens of other countries where prices are controlled through mechanisms like Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). And, given his grievance-based approach to the world in general, it is no surprise that his latest statement on the topic describesAustralia and other countries as “freeloaders” on the US.The US government is, of course, entirely within its rights to set its own policy regarding the pricing of prescription drugs. The US Department of Veterans Affairs already has a program similar to the PBS, under which it pays about half as much of the typical US price. There is no reason this couldn’t be extended to the entire US Medicare system, except that the result would be to close down 1,000 or more private plans, each with their own lobbyists.And with a bit more effort, the US could establish its own version of the PBS, covering all Americans. Quite possibly, faced with lower prices in the US, pharmaceutical companies might demand higher returns from other countries including Australia. But a systematic reform of this kind is beyond the capacity of the Trump administration. Instead we have seen the typical Trumpian claim that other countries are benefiting unfairly from medical research done in the US.This was arguably true in the second half of the 20th century when the US was the undoubted centre of global medical research, most notably through the National Institutes ofHealth. But funding for the NIH (adjusted for inflation) peaked in 2004, and has suffered from decades of financial stringency. Meanwhile, the US share of genuine innovations, measured by “new molecular entities” has declined and is no longer notably larger (relative to GDP) than that of leading European innovators. The development of semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy) treatments for obesity and diabetes by Danish firm Novo Nordisk is a notable example of a drug of particular importance to the US being developed in Europe.Albanese says PBS ‘not up for negotiation’ after US pharma complains to Trump about schemeRead moreMore generally, if Trump wants to import ideas like the PBS into the US system, Australia has plenty to offer. Australia’s Medicare system, combining a single-payer universal scheme for standard healthcare with private insurance and fee-for-service medicine as an upper tier, could provide a politically palatable way of delivering the US demand for “Medicare for all” without destroying the private sector.But of course, this isn’t the Trump way. What we will doubtless see, as in the recent tariff negotiations, is a series of bullying demands, resulting in triumphant announcements of magnificent deals, which turn out, on closer inspection, to be largely illusory.The bigger lesson for Australia in all of this is that, as with China, we need to treat the US not as an ally or friend but as a trading partner which will seek to push us around whenever possible. The correct response, again as with China, is to stand our ground until the other side sees the pointlessness of bullying and the mutual benefits of free exchange.John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland’s school of economicsExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionPharmaceuticals industryHealthMedicare AustraliaUS healthcarecommentShareReuse this content"

Here is an outrageous history of small-screen saucinessHollie RichardsonFri 1 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 12.40 EDTShareOutlander first sizzled our screens in 2014, with Vulture soon declaring that the period drama had “the best sex on television”. Its tale of second world war nurse Claire (Caitriona Balfe) time-travelling to 18th-century Scotland and falling in love with clansman Jamie (Sam Heughan) certainly earned the accolade. The wedding night episode features Claire reaching such an explosive orgasm that it requires smelling salts for viewers to get through. There’s a knee-trembling “castle cunnilingus” scene and, at one point, the extraordinary moment when Claire saves Jamie’s life by masturbating him. It has proved so popular that in 2026 its eighth (and final) season will air.In the last year we’ve had shows such as Carême, about a Napoleonic-era celebrity chef who likes foreplay with a dollop of whipped cream, and orgy-filled Mary & George, about the lover of James I of England/James VI of Scotland. Outlander has even spawned a prequel, Blood of My Blood, about the entwining stories of Claire’s and Jamie’s parents, two couples who also enjoy time travel and sex. Sure enough, there’s a romp against a table less than half an hour in, a dizzying amount of hand brushes and a sex scene that clocks up nearly 10 long minutes. How did period dramas get so raunchy?Thirty years ago, things were much more chaste. The iconic moment of Andrew Davies’s 1995 BBC adaptation of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice that shook up the genre didn’t even involve nudity – just Colin Firth’s Mr Darcy emerging from a lake in a soaking white shirt.Firth’s chemistry with Jennifer Ehle, who played Elizabeth Bennet, was undeniable: the two started dating in real life during filming. No one has sex in the series, but Davies wrote in scenes to show the hormonal young characters’ physicality and sexuality, andlookedfor “any legitimate excuse to get some of that kit off”. It certainly won over fans: last year, the shirt Firth wore sold at auction for £25,000. One professor even told the BBC that the series has “almost usurped the original novel in the minds of the public”.Seven years later, Davies shocked the nation by writing a drama that makes Pride and Prejudice look like CBeebies: an adaptation of Sarah Waters’ Victorian-set lesbian novelTipping the Velvet. Nan (Rachael Stirling) is an oyster girl who is enchanted by androgynous stage performer Kitty (Keeley Hawes). She joins her act in bohemian London and they start a sexual relationship. It divided critics, with one calling the first sex scenes “dull”. He should have stuck around for episode two.Anna Chancellorenters as dominatrix aristocrat Lady Diana – the proud owner of a massive dildo. “It was leather, wasn’t it?” asks Chancellor when I remind her of it over video call. “Was [its size] believable?” She has never seen the series and says she would have to be “really old” to stomach watching herself in it. Filming was physically difficult as the camera went round and round while she rocked on Nan’s lap. That said, she would “quite like to play [Diana] again”, and adds: “It gave me a big lesbian following, which I was thrilled with. It’s a privilege.”The show was groundbreaking for queer sex on screen, but Chancellor makes the point that it was directed by a straight man (Geoffrey Sax). “I think they wouldn’t do that now,” she ponders. Intimacy coordinators weren’t a thing back then either. Even though she admits to some of their tasks being more cringey than actually shooting sex scenes (like softly touching each other’s face and hair), she says a great one can help map out the characters’ physical relationships more convincingly: “It’s how you get there.”View image in fullscreenNo facts attached … Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII) and Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn in The Tudors.Photograph: BBC/SonyBodice-and-breeches rippers soon took off. In 2007, all historical fact went out of the window when Jonathan Rhys Meyers played Henry VIII as a hunky, brunette sex god inThe Tudors. Within four minutes of the opening episode, Henry and Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) were bonking. Hundreds of outraged fanscomplainedit was too Americanised, dumbed down and hypersexual. “These people didn’t have TVs, they didn’t have cars, they didn’t have iPods. They had sex. What else do you think they did?”Meyers once said, clearly fed up of defending it on press tours.Anyway, Henry was left in the dust in 2015, whena topless Aidan Turnerscythed his way on to prime time inPoldark. It set pulses racing to such an extent that Turner came to resent it: “It began to overshadow the show and that frustrated me. It just got boring,” he admitted of a scene that would go on to be voted TV moment of the year.View image in fullscreenFantasy … Aidan Turner getting ready for his topless scene in Poldark.Composite: PA/ BBC/Everett/Rex FeaturesBut it wasn’t the only scene to trigger debate. A scene in which Poldark forcefully kisses ex-lover Elizabeth (Heida Reed), who pushes him away and says “no” until finally conceding to sex wascriticisedas a “rape fantasy”. Poldark isn’t the only period drama tofeature problematicsex scenes. Outlander iscontinually pressedon its repeated use of brutal rape as a narrative tool – which they put down to this being a reality that can’t be totally ignored: rape only became a statutory offence in England and Wales in 1956 (and marital rape wasn’t included until 1991). In Scotland, rape was an offence in common law only until 2009. Catriona Balfe also justifies it by saying: “We have a problem in our society with sexual assault, and it’s reflected in our storytelling.”With TV audiences becomingless conservativeand streaming networks offering new freedoms, period bonkbusters went wild in the early 2010s, fromThe Borgias(which featured anincest scene) to Versailles (“four racy scenes in just 17 minutes!” cried the Daily Mail). Like most of the shows before them, they were largely written and directed by men. They also nearly always featured white leads; period drama has always had a problem with diversity. However, coinciding with the #MeToo movement, a spate of brilliant female storytellers were about to bring nuance and raise the bar once more.View image in fullscreen‘We never said titillating’ … Jessica Brown Findlay as Charlotte (centre) in Harlots.Photograph: Liam Daniel/Hulu/Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn 2017, Alison Newman and Moira Buffini co-createdHarlots, a Georgian-set drama with a diverse cast, starring Lesley Manville and Samantha Morton as warring brothel owners (it has recently enjoyed a new lease of life in Netflix’s Top 10 chart). Set in a time when sex work was incredibly valuable to the economy, it is, of course, stuffed with graphic scenes. But don’t conflate sex with “sexy”; Newman even bristles at the word when I mention it to her over the phone. It was unofficially banned from the writing room, and that wasn’t all: “Weneversaid titillating.”The show was made entirely by women from what Newman calls “the whore’s eye view”, following “a sort of reverse Bechdel test” with no more than two men in a room. Sex was a job for these women and it needed to feel real: it’s often boring or humiliating, sometimes enjoyable and at times dangerous. There’s also barely any nudity because undressing took too long.Still, there are rare moments when sex is an act of love or passion, such as when Charlotte (Jessica Brown Findlay) sleeps with male sex worker Daniel Marney (Rory Fleck Byrne) after a season spent building a friendship. “Charlotte obviously had a very complicated relationship with sex, so for her to let go like that or make herself vulnerable – it was a big moment.” That is indeed what makes sex, well, sexy (sorry Newman!). “The drama is in the desire – and what happens before and after the act is most interesting … If it’s just a couple of people shagging, then what’s the point?”View image in fullscreenIntimate moment … Sophie Rundle as Ann Walker and Suranne Jones as Anne Lister in Gentleman Jack.Photograph: Aimee Spinks/BBC/Lookout Point/HBOAround the same time, Sally Wainwright was working onGentleman Jack, a drama about 19th-century Yorkshire landowner Anne Lister (Suranne Jones) who is widely considered the first modern lesbian, and her relationship with Ann Walker (Sophie Rundle). Tabloids called the same-sex scenes “steamy” and “shocking”, but a lot of care was taken with them. “We used the camera to come in on us and find intimate moments,” Jones said. “By the end, me and Sophie were like two nans with a cup of tea. Like, covers off, hanging out. And it was great.”Andrew Davies also created another barrier-breaking adaptation of Austen – her unfinished novelSanditon. This time, he went as far as adding in sex scenes.“I write something that I would like to watch,” he said. “And I suppose the sexing it up thing comes in fairly naturally.” Not only that, a scene showing the bums of two nude male characters going for a swim – which they would have done in those days – raised the issue of objectification. “Are there different standards? So what if there are,” star Kris Marshall said. “Is it the objectification of men when we’ve had the objectification of women for so long?” (A2016 reportfound that female nudity was almost three times as likely as male in Hollywood films.)But raunch comes in all forms. For many viewers, one of the most erotic scenes on television in recent years was Andrew Scott in silk pyjamas dancing to T Rex’s Dandy in the Underworld. He played Lord Merlin in Emily Mortimer’s adaptation of Nancy Mitford’s 1930s coming-of-age storyThe Pursuit of Love. It was a casting masterstroke. Merlin sticks his middle finger up, slinks around and – in a flooring moment – abruptly kisses one of the beautiful young things, wipes his mouth and spins her away. “That was all him, he just delivered,” Mortimer tells me over a call. “It just came so easily, and he went for it. He has exactly the right amount of charm, fearlessness and a kind of twinkle.” It was shot during lockdown and the first thing Scott said to her after filming that scene was: “I just feel so lucky to be at a party!”The reaction of Lily James’s teenage character Linda, who is watching from the sidelines in a ballroom, mirrors our blushing at home: she is full of lust and longing for life to start, and finds Merlin’s sexual liberation almost too painfully sexy to watch. “Lily did it so well,” says Mortimer. “It’s hilarious but also kind of heartbreaking and very recognisable.”Smaller moments really do have the power to fluster a nation. Regency-eraBridgertonis one of the biggest and raciest shows today – and a celebration of how far we have come regarding sex in period drama, with diverse characters having lots of sex that is both a hoot to watch and always female focused. It also gave life to the more X-rated spin-off Queen Charlotte(she did have 15 babies, after all).

Harriet Slater, who plays Jamie’s mother Ellen, tells me the chemistry read with Jamie Roy (her onscreen forbidden lover Brian) was “unlike any other”. Roy says: “The sparks do fly.” And there’s that epic sex scene, whose shooting involved turning raunchiness into something as highly choreographed and rehearsed as a stunt or dance. Sometimes, though, you can have too much sexual tension. “On the very first take I burst out laughing! I got told off very swiftly,” smiles Roy. “If you take it too seriously, you get too tired!” adds Slater. But did they pull it off? “Smashed it.”Outlander: Blood of My Blood is on MGM+ via Prime Video on 9 August.This article was amended on 1 August 2025. An earlier version said that rape only became illegal in the UK in 1956.

Bond is perhaps best known for the Pet Shop Boys movie It Couldn’t Happen Here, released in 1988; but that was just one pitstop in an unusually shaped career that took the form of, if not two halves, two distinct sections that in retrospect appear subtly intertwined.Bond’s commission from thePet Shop Boysstemmed from earlier work on The South Bank Show, particularly an episode about Roald Dahl in which the author encounters characters from his books – and in fact much of Bond’s career was occupied by what are essentially arts documentaries, albeit highly unconventional ones. He started off at the BBC in the early 1960s, with programmes about the first world war poets and George Orwell, culminating in a still-impressive film in 1965 about Salvador Dalí, called Dalí in New York, which investigated the constructed nature of Dalí’s artist personality by using, among others, “meta” shots of Bond himself discussing the filming process.View image in fullscreenJane Arden on the set of Separation in London’s Portobello Road in 1966.Photograph: Kaye/Getty ImagesDalí in New York was also significant because it was the first time Bond directed a well-known writer, actor and media intellectual named Jane Arden. It wasn’t the first time they had met, or worked together, but no doubt it cemented their creative relationship. Shortly afterwards, the pair would work together on what would become Bond’s feature directing debut in 1967. Separation, written by and starring Arden, is a cut-up, fractured account of a woman unhappily caught between a failing marriage and a younger lover she is uncertain about, all against the backdrop of mid-60s swinging London. The fact that Arden was herself in a failing marriage (to TV director Philip Saville) and in a relationship with a younger lover (Bond himself) is no doubt relevant.Arden isa fascinating figure in her own right; apart from anything else, she appears to be the only woman in the whole of the 1970s to have a solo directing credit on a British feature film. That would be the next film she and Bond made together, The Other Side of the Underneath, based on Arden’s happening called A New Communion for Freaks, Prophets and Witches, which she developed with her all-female theatre company Holocaust. Having been a successful playwright and TV writer, it is clear that in the period since Separation, Arden had absorbed the most radical ideas of the time, from anti-psychiatry to encounter-group therapy. The Other Side of the Underneath, which Bond produced and appeared in, is one of the most extraordinary, if deeply unsettling, films to have been made in the UK.Perhaps the stress of making it suggested to Arden she should share the directing of their third film, Anti-Clock, with Bond It is a bizarre, hermetic, and often baffling fable featuring one of Arden’s sons, Sebastian Saville, who plays both a therapy subject and the professor attempting to treat him. Arden’s motives, though, remain obscure; she killed herself in 1982 and Bond subsequently withdrew from circulation the films they made together. Twenty-five years later, however, they were rediscovered and reissued by the British Film Institute, an amazingly valuable act of cultural archaeology.View image in fullscreenJack Bond.Photograph: noneArden’s death closed a chapter. In retrospect, Bond’s part in it looks like an extension of the improvisatory, boundary-breaking style he brought to his documentaries – which, if you squint a bit, could also include It Couldn’t Happen Here. Bond continued to make films focusing on creative personalities – notablyThe Blue Black Hussarin 2013 which allowed Adam Ant to ruminate onthe mental health crises that derailed himsome years earlier. Perhaps if Bond had made a successful awards-bait feature, or if Arden had been more inclined to create a conventional narrative, either or both of them might be more widely known, or sustain a more significant place in British film culture. Be that as it may, their films, along with Bond’s solo work, are fascinating in their own right, and unquestionably worth seeking out.Separation and It Couldn’t Happen Here are screening at the Ultimate Picture Palace, Oxford,on 2 August, and It Couldn’t Happen Here is screening in a double bill with Battleship Potemkin scored by Pet Shop Boys at BFI Southbank, London on 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDocumentary filmsSalvador DalíPet Shop BoysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I had this spiritual awakening’Laura BartonThe musician was living in his mother’s basement when he blagged a job in LA. Soon, his mesmeric live shows sparked a bidding frenzy. He describes how finding his wavelength on stage can fill audiences with joyFri 1 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareFour years ago, Tyler Perry’s stepfather offered him a job in the office of his dog-training company in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Perry had little else to fill his time: he was 29 and living in his mother’s basement, uncertain what he should do with the rest of his life.In 2017, he had left Berklee College of Music, where he had ostensibly studied songwriting, but largely smoked weed and skipped class. The songs he wrote then were introspective and folk-driven, in the lineage of Nick Drake and Elliott Smith – artists he had been drawn to in his senior year of high school, who had spoken to him just as depression had first set in. “I was depressed for, like, 10 years,” he says.In idle moments in the office, he would scour Craigslist, imagining a different life in New York or Nashville or LA. One day, on a whim, he applied for a recruitment job at a commercial real estate company in Los Angeles. He lied about his experience, and the fact he didn’t have a degree. “I just wrote a really good email,” he says. “And 20 minutes later they called me. I went through two interviews in a day, and then they said: ‘Can you be here in two weeks?’” Perry had never been to Los Angeles. That evening, he talked it over with his family and friends. “And my mom said: ‘What do you have to lose? A few thousand dollars? You can always come back.’ So I moved to Venice Beach, California.”In a clip of Perry that began to circulate online last autumn, the singer was filmed at Eagle Rock bar The Fableperforming Help Me Out– a song that longs for self-acceptance the way one might yearn for a lover. He moves around the stage with a sensuous majesty, a large man in triple denim, flicking his hair, courting the mic stand, his voice moving effortlessly from earth-deep to celestial. There is something of Elvis and Roy Orbison and Harry Nilsson; the kind of easy, confident performance that feels like alchemy.In person, Perry is a faintly beatific presence, sitting in a Brighton cafe in the gap between shows at the city’s Great Escape festival. He speaks gently, his conversation ranging from the suburbs of Rhode Island to the free kombucha at WeWork via countercultural philosopher Alan Watts’s thoughts on ego. What quickly becomes clear is the distance between the solid assurance of Perry’s stage self and the more tentative man sitting across the table.Before all of this – before the dog-training office and the real estate application – Perry had begun working with a counsellor and dietician named Courtney Huard. For a couple of years the pair worked on improving Perry’s sense of body positivity and mental health, and the impact was immense. “She was an incredible person and I’m really lucky I came across her,” Perry says. Around the same time, he discovered the work of self-help teacher Eckhart Tolle and his book The Power of Now, and took an Enneagram personality test. “I pinned my personality to a wall, and I got to see it for the first time,” he says. “And it shocked me out of depression. I had this kind of spiritual awakening.”The problem was that this newly awakened Perry did not fit quite so well with his catalogue of melancholy folk songs. For years, when he played live, he had hidden behind his guitar, his voice flat and whispered. “I was wanting to be ‘cool’ in that sense of ‘mystical, can’t grasp it …’” he says. “But I don’t think that’s necessarily me.”In California, he lived out of a suitcase, worked for the property company in the day, and at night played open mics across the city. Mostly he would play a couple of his own folk songs, and then a cover of Roy Orbison’s Crying. It was this last song that hit the sweet spot. “People would freak out, and it would be like it was my birthday,” he says. “Everybody in the place looking at me and clapping.”He realised that covering Orbison’s song called on the skills he had first learned doing musical theatre in high school: a supported singing voice, a sense of generosity and occasion. Perry wondered if this might be a new direction for him – one that drew on all of his musical loves, from showtunes to Fleet Foxes, via Jonathan Richman and the Who’s 1969 rock opera, Tommy. He dreamed up a character for himself, called it Tyler Ballgame – a nod to the nickname of legendary Boston Red Sox baseball player, Ted Williams, and a joking put-down to himself, a man who had spent years squandering his talent in his mother’s basement, being the very opposite of a sporting legend. He set about working out how this Tyler Ballgame might write and perform.At Berklee, Perry had attended a performance studies class taught by Livingston Taylor (brother of singer-songwriter James Taylor). The classes were held in a theatre, and on the first day, Taylor invited each of his 40 students to stand on the stage. You had to go up and hold your palms out to the audience, and shift your weight from one foot to the other in time, and look everybody in the eye.It struck Perry as brilliant.In Los Angeles, Perry remembered the class, and it struck him as an act of radical presence; something Tyler Ballgame might do. He started to try it in his live shows. “I’d reach out to the audience and look them in the eye. Like, we’re both here to do something. I’m trying to connect, and we’re going to live this experience together.” The songs came with an ease. Soulful, and sad sometimes, but also brimming with something hopeful and alive. They carried the richness and simplicity of the classics.Perry relocated to East Los Angeles, began collaborating with other neighbouring musicians, and playing live as much as he could. One day, the producer Jonathan Rado, famed for his work with Miley Cyrus and the Killers, happened to see an Instagram story of a Tyler Ballgame show and contacted him. The singer went over to Rado’s studio shortly afterwards and over the next couple of weeks, the pair recorded more than an album’s worth of material.Word of Tyler Ballgame soon spread, and by last autumn, record labels had begun making fevered bids to sign him. In the end, Perry went with the British independent Rough Trade, connecting with them over a shared love of Nick Drake and Arthur Russell. “I had a lot of options and it was really flattering and really crazy,” he says, “but I just kept coming back to Rough Trade, because of that kindred spirit of whatever music I make naturally, in my soul, they already love, because they’ve already put out all the music that I love.”Perry makes for easy company, and after an hour and a half of conversation I ask if there is anything else he might like to tell me. “I don’t know,” he says slowly, and hesitates. “Maybe I’d like to mention my counsellor, Courtney, again,” he says. “She had her life taken, really horrifically.” Huard was killed by her husband, who later killed himself. Perry learned of her death when a friend sent him a news article from his local newspaper back in Rhode Island. Perry saw the photograph and was stunned.At that precise moment he had been writing Help Me Out, a song largely inspired by Huard. “She made me realise your value is not tied to the size of your body, or how people look at you – things which had kept me from even being on stage at all.“There are so many people on the messageboards of her funeral posts and her obituary saying: ‘She set me on the course of my life.’ She was a really special person, and it just shows how precious life is. So I live for her.”It is a hot afternoon, but Perry takes to the stage at the UnBarred Brewery wearing a woollen jumper. He looks out to the crowd, gently spreads his palms, and begins to sing. It is a golden performance, the songs sounding almost as if they have always existed, and Perry entirely mesmerising.As he plays, I think of something he told me over lunch – about the freedom and fluidity of performance. “I want to be totally in the flow state, likegone,” he said. “Where nothing is canned or prepared or contrived.”Some shows, he told me, you get it, and the rest of the band get it, and the audience gets it, too. “And then it’s like real magic. It’s a celebration of the joy of performance and the joy of music.” Today as Perry and the band play, the air is filled with a kind of joy – with something like real magic in the warmth of a Sussex afternoon.Tyler Ballgame’s new single New Car is out now. He playsthe End of the Road festival, nr Blandford Forum, 30 August,andThe Lexington, London, 10 September.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockSoulfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thank you to all of his fans and friends – those who cherished his music. And a big thank you for all of the memories. His legacy will live on through his music and all of his fans.”The cause of death is unknown but a Januarypostfrom his family stated that he was “in the hospital facing a medical hurdle”.According to his son Arturo, his last words were “Ya estoy cansado”, which translates to “I’m tired.”Jiménez won six Grammy awards in his career, including for country instrumental performance and tejano music performance, and a lifetime achievement award in 2015. “This one, the lifetime achievement, is top of the line,” hesaidat the time. “You can’t go higher than that one.”His sound was instrumental in definingtejano and conjunto music. The Guardian’s Piper LeMoine wrote that “the soundtrack of the American south-west would be incomplete” without these two genres.“The way I learned to play the accordion was on the wild and happy side, much like Cajun and zydeco music,” he once said in aninterview. “One of my early idols was Clifton Chenier. The way he played, it was like the accordion was yelling at you: hey, take this. I like to make my accordion yell and scream and make it happy.”After performing in San Antonio in the 1960s, Jiménez went to New York City and worked with artists including Bob Dylan, Carlos Santana, Willie Nelson and the Rolling Stones.His first solo album was released in 1972 and he would go on to record more than 25 in his career.A tribute was paid by Cesar Rosas, a member of Los Lobos who worked with Jiménez on the song Don’t Worry Baby.“Not only was Flaco my musical mentor, but he was also a dear friend to all of us Los Lobos,” Rosas said to theSan Antonio Express-News. “He was such a musical influence on me that [he] made me run out and buy a bajo sexto and start using it in my band. He will forever be in my heart. What a tremendous loss.”Explore more on these topicsMusicTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

Last month saw Lena Dunham recount her days as an American getting to grips with the realities of London inToo Much, and as production begins on yet another adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, here comes the sudsy romance My Oxford Year where the object of affection is England itself.One might assume that a university-set film directed byThe Inbetweenerscreator Iain Morris would be a ribald comedy geared toward a younger male crowd, but My Oxford Year, based on a novel by Julia Whelan, picks sentiment over sauce. It’s a frothy, throwaway fantasy about another American hoping to find herself in another country, think ofEmily in Parisbut Anna in Oxford. Anna (in-house Netflix star Sofia Carson) is a working-class New Yorker who has decided to defer her job at Goldman Sachs for a year so that she can study at Oxford, indulging her love of literature before she disappears into a life of numbers.The Naked Gun review – Liam Neeson deadpans impeccably in outrageously amusing spoof rebootRead moreHer idealised view is somewhat confirmed. There’s undeniable historical beauty surrounding her (unlike so many otherNetflixfilms, some on-location shooting helps to seduce those watching too) but in maybe the film’s only really amusing moment, we also see Anna having to reckon with the less postcard-suited side of life as her new friends show her what a perfect English evening looks like: watching an episode of Naked Attraction. Like any of the many Americans before her, from Andie MacDowell to Julia Roberts, she also finds herself falling for a foppish gent, fellow bibliophile Jamie (Bridgerton alum Corey Mylchreest).They are given a laughably convoluted meet-cute – his fancy car splashes a cartoonishly oversized puddle on her, she then sees him at the chippy and lands him in hot water with the woman he’s hiding from, she then finds out he’s her replacement teacher for the year (!) – and a romance the colour of beige follows. There are initial attempts to add some spice – he’s a privileged fuckboy who leaves conquests in his wake and she’s a salt of the earth overachiever who puts him in his place – but there’s not enough juicy conflict between them. It’s all boringly plain sailing until it suddenly isn’t and the film takes a turn from romcom into something more dramatic.More dramatic but also less interesting, as Anna finds out why Jamie has been holding back and given how the film handles the reveal like a twist, I’ll spare the details but when it comes, it’s met with a sigh of disappointment for we know exactly what story we’re being told and every single beat that will follow. It’s such well-mined territory that at this stage, to keep us even somewhat invested in such a rehash, we’d need something with far more texture or emotional rawness than this. The unsuccessful swerve then overwhelms any of the potentially knottier, more engaging elements of managing differences of class, choosing between art and commerce and grappling with a life caught between two different continents.Morris is a competent enough director but the script, from Allison Burnett and Melissa Osborne, is devoid of any real electricity, leaving it up to the leads to generate it. Carson is a better fit here than she was at playing a scrappy mess in Netflix’s similarly vanilla hitThe Life List, but she’s a little indistinctive, not quite magnetic enough to carry the weight of an every-scene lead performance. There’s more promise in Mylchreest, whose Hugh Grant cosplay is charming enough to suggest that with a sharper, wittier script he could really do something with it.As passive Netflix watches go – consumed while doing something else, destined to be forgotten about almost instantaneously – it’s better than some but as last year’s adjacent romantic weepieIt Ends With Usshowed, there’s so much more to be done in territory that often gets unfairly and snobbishly downgraded. There are big, relatable emotions to be mined but that grand sweep just never arrives in My Oxford Year, a late summer vacation that leaves us firmly on the couch.My Oxford Year is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsNetflixComedy filmsComedyDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Set in the Spanish coastal city of Almería, the book – which has now been made into a film starring Sex Education’s Emma Mackey – is a sun-drenched unravelling of a daughter tethered to her ailing mother.Hot Milk fits into a growing canon of literature exploring the absent, or fading, or otherwise inaccessible mother – stories in which the maternal figure is pulled to the edge of the frame, so that the daughter can take centre stage. Books such asGwendoline Riley’s My PhantomsandFirst Love, both featuring mother-daughter relationships marked by emotional distance and strained communication.OrThe Lost DaughterbyElena Ferrante, where the protagonist, Leda, is both unseen daughter and deserting mother, a collision that unleashes emotional chaos.That writers slip into the narrative reflex of the mother as too powerful or too centralto allow for a character’s development is revealing. Space must be cleared for the daughter to suffer, individuate and grow. Yet, these novels also show that we never fully cast our mother out. She remains at the edges of our identity, both threat to the self and origin.Hot Milk – adapted for film by Rebecca Lenkiewicz and released in the UK last month – follows Sofia and her mother, Rose, as they travel to Spain in search of a cure for Rose’s unexplained paralysis.In the novel, Sofia seems to inherit her mother’s pain: “Sometimes, I find myself limping,” she says. “It’s as if my body remembers the way I walk with my mother.” She experiences psychosomatic symptoms mirroring her mother’s sickness, and must break free from her mother’s feigned helplessness in order to discover her own body, her own desires.View image in fullscreenBoth unseen daughter and deserting mother ... Olivia Colman in the film adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s The Lost Daughter.Photograph: Yannis Drakoulidis/NetflixBut what is most poignant is that Levy, whose works refuse sentimental arcs, shows us that this separation isn’t always clean cut. It can sometimes be a feverish drift. Sofia’s freedom is not triumphant, but strange and unstable. Levy doesn’t promise that separation brings clarity, rather she suggests it may bring vertigo. And few stories succeed in making this psychological umbilical cord feel more real.In my own novel Selfish Girls, we see three women trying to be daughters but also yearning to be free. To adequately write about this tension, I first needed to interrogate why the absence of the mother makes for such compelling storytelling. Why do we keep circling it, again and again? The opacity comes from cultural contradiction: motherhood is revered as sacred and essential, and yet mothers themselves are often invisible or misunderstood. A mother will always be defined by her absence because she will never fully be there – or never as youneedher to be. Then there’s the strange ache of it: that in her presence, our mother remains unknowable. She is the most familiar stranger we’ll ever love, and that is narrative gold. “The hardest things to talk about are the ones we ourselves can’t understand,” writes Ferrante inThe Lost Daughter. Subtext is the pressure point where literary complexity builds: “Who was my mother, really?” becomes the story engine.My own mother was this impenetrable mystery I needed to let go of in order to become myself, but she was also someone so close, whose laugh carried through my own, whose image I caught glimpses of in my own reflection. In some sense, my novel is a reckoning of wanting to truly understand her at the same time as I am detaching, getting married, assuming my own family unit and moving to another country, putting an ocean between us. Idolising and rejecting her all at once. Perhaps there is ambivalence and guilt for stepping away, tangled with the quieter grief and shame of feeling I’d been left long before. Maybe the act of writing offers a way back into those unknowns of deep love and resentment, trying to shape them into something I could live with – a story of my own, without losing the parts of my mother that still mattered.My own mother was this impenetrable mystery I needed to let go of in order to become myselfRiley captures this bind with razor-sharp realism and cool, clipped colloquialism in First Love. Neve receives a text from her mother: “CUT ALL MY HAIR OFF DO YOU WANT BOBBLES AND BRUSHES ETC. MUM.” It has to be wheedled out of her that she is, in fact, going through a tough time having broken up with her boyfriend. With pitch-perfect humour, Riley captures the apparent availability of the mother against a background of emotional absence. Neve recalls visits or phone calls with her mother characterised by awkwardness and superficiality.The protagonist in My Phantoms echoes this: “She asked questions she didn’t want answers to, and gave answers no one had asked for”. For Riley, the maternal relationship is a tug-of-war between performance and authenticity. The mother’s presence feels like a performance of motherhood only – all form, no feeling – leaving the daughters deeply isolated in their company. You see, it is not enough for our mother to simply be a mother; she must embody the right kind of motherhood.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

To leave room, in other words, to disappear.” To withdraw just enough so the child can emerge as a self.Levy, Riley and Ferrante are trying to do on paper what we can never quite do in life: allow the mother to live fully inside our skin as a presence absorbed. In Hot Milk, Levy doesn’t resolve the mother-daughter bind, she lets it linger in the body – a felt, inescapable inheritance. Perhaps these stories don’t offer catharsis, but do something braver: let the mother remain inside the daughter, not as obstacle or ideal, but metabolised as a presence the self must grow around.Selfish Girls is published by Hodder & StoughtonExplore more on these topicsBooksDeborah LevyElena FerranteThe Lost DaughterOlivia ColmanGwendoline RileyParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He plays Frank Drebin Jr, the police-detective son of Leslie Nielsen’s Frank Drebin in the original. Created by the celebrated comedy team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, The Naked Gun was released in 1988, with Nielsen featuring in two sequels, The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear from 1991 and Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult in 1994, as well as the preceding TV series Police Squad!, which aired in 1982. Neeson’s intense, unflappable acting style has been acclaimed by critics as a perfect match for Nielsen’s celebrated stone-face delivery;the Guardian’s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw said thatNeeson “deadpans it impeccably”, whilethe Telegraph’s Robbie Collin writesthat Neeson “delivers his dialogue with a gravelly matter-of-factness that only compounds its lunacy”.View image in fullscreenNeeson in the ‘dad action’ film Taken, 2008, which revived his career.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/AllstarAt the age of 73, Neeson’s current status as the star of a hit mainstream comedy – augmented byrumours of a romancewith his co-star Pamela Anderson – is a world away from his emergence as a bona fide leading man in the early 1990s, when he put his teenage proficiency in boxing to good use in the Scotland-set drama The Big Man, bagged an Oscar nomination for playing Oskar Schindler in Schindler’s List, and nobly donned plaid, kilt and sporran as 18th century highlander Rob Roy.Neeson’s ability to project a weighty sense of gravitas in these wildly differing roles was compounded by his casting as Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins, in Neil Jordan’s 1996 biopic, the most politically sensitive – and closest to home – of his early leading roles. Born in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, Neeson was raised Catholic but later said he was, ironically, inspired to become an actor after watching the firebrand Protestant leader Rev Ian Paisley preach, saying: “It was incredible to watch this 6ft-plus man just bible-thumping away.”View image in fullscreenNeeson, right, with Ewan McGregor in 1999’s Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.Photograph: Lucasfilm/AllstarNeeson’s career took its first unexpected deviation in the late 1990s when he was cast as Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, George Lucas’s return to the Star Wars universe in 1999, with Lucas describing Neeson as “a master actor, who the other actors will look up to”. This excursion into fantasy-blockbuster moviemaking was cemented with a role as principal antagonist Ra’s al Ghul in Christopher Nolan’sBatman Beginsin 2005, and lending his voice to Aslan the lion in the three Narnia films from the same period: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Neeson’s standing in the industry also allowed him to take smaller roles in landmark films in the same period, including Gangs of New York and Love Actually.He had, however, lost his leading-man status in Hollywood, and it was the success ofTaken– a French production, written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel – that returned him to the spotlight. Neeson later said he was “stunned” by its impact, adding: “I really thought it would be kind of a little side road from my so-called career. Really thought it would go straight to video.” Taken’s box office receipts amounted to nine times its $25m (£19m) budget and virtually inaugurated the “dad action” movie, thrillers featuring leads in late middle age; it is also the film with which Neeson is arguably now most identified with. Neeson went on to make a string of dad action films, including Unknown, Non-Stop, The Ice Road and Retribution.Neeson’s reinvention as an action star coincided with a period of personal tragedy, after thedeath of his wife, Natasha Richardson, in a skiing accidentin 2009. The pair had met in 1993 while co-starring in a Broadway production of Eugene O’Neill’s play Anna Christie, and married a year later. Neeson later said that grief over her death was partly responsible for his withdrawing from the lead role in Steven Spielberg’s biopic of Abraham Lincoln, released in 2012, in which he was replaced by Daniel Day-Lewis.View image in fullscreenHis role in the Steven Spielberg-directed Schindler’s List was Oscar nominated.Photograph: Atlas Photography/JB EntMore recently Neesonwas heavily criticised, and subsequently apologised, for saying that, in his youth, he had gone out looking to “kill” a random black man in revenge for a sexual assault on a friend. Neeson had mentioned the incident in 2019 during the press tour for another action film, Cold Pursuit, later saying: “The horror of what happened to my friend ignited irrational thoughts that do not represent the person I am. In trying to explain those feelings today, I missed the point and hurt many people.”Neeson’s career, however, appears to have been relatively unaffected by the controversy,as well as his commentin 2018 that the recent wave of sexual misconduct allegations in the entertainment industry was “bit of a witch-hunt”. With The Naked Gun commanding significant media attention – as much for speculation on Neeson’s personal life as for the film itself – the actor’s stock is as high as it has ever been.Explore more on these topicsLiam NeesonLeslie NielsenTakenSchindler's ListBatman BeginsChronicles of NarniaprofilesShareReuse this content"

Having been rounded up, each ringleader was tied to the mouth of a cannon. Before the eyes of the public, the weapon was fired.To emphasise the point, a cannon sits on stage in Kanpur: 1857 – surely the largest prop at the fringe – positioned threateningly behind Niall Moorjani, who plays a storyteller facing his final hour, trying to come up with a narrative that makes sense of his awful predicament. How did a boy who grew up peacefully on the banks of the Ganges, who was captivated by poetry and the beauty of the spoken word, end up in this situation?Didn’t his fellow rebel forces have the good grace to free their captured enemies and return their weapons? He sees himself as a good man caught up in the harsh tide of history.Moorjani,a storyteller, is a still and compelling narrator, whose performance is enhanced by the live tabla playing of Sodhi (Hardeep Deerhe), sitting meditatively by his side. They are joined by Jonathan Oldfield as the British army executioner, whose membership of a Scottish regiment (posh southern accent notwithstanding) serves as a reminder that Scotland was as gung-ho a part of the British empire as England.The soldier is intrigued by his captive’s tale, but on too much of a power kick to be empathic. The character’s presence in and out of the audience gives the performance a lively dynamic, although not quite enough to create a full-fledged play. The production sits in limbo between storytelling and drama, even as it remains a shameful and important reminder of a neglected period of British history.At the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsThis article was amended on 1 August 2025 to correct some personal information.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Safe to say the definition of mental illness was not the same as it is today. Inmates could end up being committed for anything from promiscuity to poverty.It was here thatDr Jean-Martin Charcotdeveloped his theory of hysteria, a word whose etymology goes back to the Greek word for uterus. Breaking with a long tradition of doctors who attributed erratic behaviour in women to a wandering womb, Charcot treated hysteria as a neurological disorder. He insisted men could be susceptible too.In that and other areas, Charcot was a medical pioneer, even if his use of hypnosis, photography and showmanship strike us as eccentric today. We no longer ask patients to perform their illness for a curious audience nor do we recognise his four stages of hysteria.That conditions in Victorian asylums were less than ideal and that women have had a raw deal due to the slow evolution of psychiatry hardly needs saying. What makes Helena McBurney’s script so riveting is the way it blends misogyny and mental illness into fluid theatrical poetry, blurring the line between medic and patient in a play that is half lecture, half nightmare.Dressed in silky off-white trousers and a top buttoned up the back like a designer straitjacket, actor Charlotte McBurney gives a high-precision performance that crackles with vulnerability, confusion and intelligence. Haunted by voices coming at her from all directions in Bella Kear’s swirling sound design, she morphs from sober narrator to pompous doctor to psychotic Salpêtrière resident in a troubling collage.In Christina Deinsberger’s production for Fish in a Dress, the actor is crisp, physical and speedy as she draws us from lucidity to feverishness and makes connections to the treatment of women across the centuries.At the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalMental healthreviewsShareReuse this content"

He has apologised “for any distress caused” and said the report cleared him of “the most serious and sensational accusations”.Torode was dropped as a presenter after he said he was the subject of a substantiated complaint over theuse of racist language, which he believes never happened.On Thursday the Guardian revealed thatone of the contestants from the latest series of MasterChef had been edited out of the programme, after telling its producers she did not want the show to be broadcast.Sarah Shafi, from Leeds, said she told the show’s producers that airing it would send the wrong message about the treatment of women.She said she initially rejected an offer by MasterChef’s producers, Banijay, to edit her out of her episode. The 57-year-old agreed to be removed once the BBC announced ithad decided to broadcast the series from 6 August.“I didn’t say edit me out,” she said. “I said: ‘Axe the show, don’t air the show. I’m asking you not to air the show.’ Prominent figures have been abusing their power. What message does that send out to women?”One formerMasterChefworker who said she had been groped by Wallace told BBC News the decision to broadcast the series showed “a blatant disregard for the people who have come forward”.Another person who worked on the show, and who said Wallace pulled his trousers down in front of her, said the decision to air the series was “profoundly disrespectful” to people who had made complaints. “It ultimately sends a message that such behaviour can be overlooked,” she said.Explore more on these topicsMasterChefGregg WallaceSexual harassmentBBCFood TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Co-written by John Hughes, the star attraction is Richard Attenborough at his twinkliest as Kriss Kringle, a man dragged into a court case after declaring himself to be Santa. What’s so remarkable is just how utterly festive the film is, despite being a courtroom drama about a potentially deluded old man.SHExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightNature documentariesTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a necessarily melancholy affair but also somewhat stirring in its depiction of tireless, valuable service.Disney+, from Wednesday 6 AugustThe Proud Family: Louder and ProuderView image in fullscreenProud and loud … Oscar (voiced by Tommy Davidson) and the family return.Photograph: DisneyA third series for this accomplished animation that follows the exploits of the Prouds, an upwardly mobile African American family who mix cartoonish hijinks with strong, slightly earnest moral messaging about identity and hot-button social justice issues. Trudy is worried about screentime and it isn’t just her kids who can’t put down their phones – her husband Oscar is hardly setting a good example. Cue a decision to live more consciously and to take a family holiday to London, Paris and Nairobi that becomes life-changing for everyone involved.Apple TV+, from Wednesday 6 Augustskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The series doesn’t just tell us that deep, platonic friendships between men and women are possible – it shows us. It’s hard to avoid the feeling that Will and Sylvia have more fun together than with anyone else. And that’s the whole point: shouldn’t that be enough? As we return, Will is preparing to marry Jenna but admits to Sylvia that he has a crush on someone else. The fear that it might turn out to be Sylvia herself soon passes but, even so, is this another symptom of Will’s inability to commit to adult life?Apple TV+, from Wednesday 6 AugustHouse of CatsView image in fullscreenPurr-fect idea … new feline gameshow House for Cats.Photograph: Channel 4Most people would probably agree that the absence of a gameshow for cats and their owners is a glaring omission from the TV schedules. So thank goodness, finally, for House of Cats, a three-parter of snappy episodes which is hosted by comic Ivo Graham and social media personality, and qualified veterinary surgeon, Cat the Vet. Fittingly, there’s no hint of a cash prize here; instead the winning partnership will take home a golden litter tray. Given that cats are notoriously much harder to organise than dogs, they will have certainly earned it.Channel 4, from Thursday 7 AugustPrometheaView image in fullscreenIntwined … Fantine Harduin stars in Promethea.Photograph: T Langro/Channel 4From Walter Presents, this daft but moderately creepy mystery drama from France stars Fantine Harduin as the titular teenager. When Promethea is hit by a car, she eventually wakes from a coma with no recollection of anything but her unusual name. Gradually, her memory starts to return but that proves to be a mixed blessing as a series of disturbing revelations about an unsolved recent murder start to spill out. At first, it seems that Promethea might have witnessed this killing – but could her involvement have been even more hands-on?Channel 4, from Friday8 AugustExplore more on these topicsTV streamingThe seven best shows to stream this weekTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The poems weave the dynamism of the Romany language with English to celebrate our intimacy with the natural world’s vast mystery and beauty: “from elm top to hedgerow … from harebell to whitethroat: / Sorí simensar sí men, / Sorí simensar sí men.” (We are all one.) This evocative braid of language is also used to consider the aching cruelty of oppression – “The gavvers kettle the Travellers on the market square. / The locals stand by gawking, piss-taking” – as well as the defiant, quicksilver power of Romany language and community. “Nouns grew spry and spring-heeled /… words which Travellers / might ride, or hide behind from hard law /… But spoken language moves / like meltwater under ice. Speech thaws into life.”View image in fullscreenVersus Versus: 100 Poems by Deaf, Disabled& Neurodivergent Poets, edited by Rachael Boast (Bloodaxe, £14.99)This anthology is a dizzying, continent-crossing explosion of verse, its topics and styles as individual as the poets; revelling in the diversity of a community that is often boxed in by ableism and prejudice. A potent theme of resisting limits courses through the book. Lateef McLeod’s poem pushes back against others’ definitions: “I am too pretty for your Ugly Laws, / too smooth to be shut in”, while Mishka Hoosen’s work celebrates the power and agency of those who think and live differently: “I am that howl / in the night ward. I am electric / without your help.” In a period in the UK when disabled people’s rights and living conditions are under threat, this collection feels timely. As Maya Abu-Hayyat suggests: “They will fall in the end, / those who say you can’t.”View image in fullscreenSo Whatby Frederick Seidel (Faber, £12.99)So What energetically decries the spectre of death and the grinding indignities of illness and age facing the 89-year-old poet, while skewering the failures of the American empire and the west more widely. In the brilliant title poem, set in Claridge’s, the speaker describes a gilded bubble of privilege in a world of atrocity: “The marble shines like syrup. / So what they whip the marble with a riding crop / To keep the lava from Vesuvius away from us / And keep Pompeii plush and posh.” Seidel remains the toweringly enigmatic, ludic and at times offensive provocateur, yet his lyric abilities with image and line never lose their power: “My breath steamed up, / A foghorn of silence inflaming the air.” So when he writes, “Poetry is meaningless. / Poetry is a disgrace on a warm spring day”, it feels that, for all his effervescent bile, we should only half believe him.In the Hollow of the Waveby Nina Mingya Powles (Nine Arches, £11.99)This luminous second collection is interested in the power of material creativity in all its forms, both within visual art and within the rich, often overlooked realms of fashion, textiles and fabric. The poet speaks of the subtle potency of clothing to shape the self and to chart memory, celebrating her Chinese-Malaysian heritage while rejecting others’ ignorance: “a gown can map a white orientalist’s dreamscape / a gown can trace the outline of a field from one’s childhood”. The book also deftly engages with the uneasy beauty of nature during a time of ecological crisis, drawing on her upbringing in Aotearoa New Zealand to create vividly unsettling images of a changing world. “It is both beautiful / and terrible / to understand the colours of a pacific coastal wildfire / wet lupine creamy aster drenched rhododendron crinkled / into pearly flame.”Transfigurations: Collected Poemsby Jay Wright (Penguin Classics, £14.99)Finally, British readers can get to grips with a profoundly original, ambitious and globally minded writer. Wright’s lyrical, experimental verse traverses world traditions and beliefs, mining the heritage of his African ancestry alongside the influence of an upbringing in the American southwest, a fulcrum of American, Spanish and Navajo cultures. The poems offer a deep engagement with spiritual knowledge and myth: “I see the God himself dance/ and turn about himself/ like the stars he moves…” They also explore the vigour of ritual, and how it might lead to personal and communal transformation: “in the order of these acts, / I take your presence upon me. /…I have been trying to create a language/ to return what you have lost /… a language to return you to yourself.” Despite their variety, these dazzling, questing poems are always seeking to discover how a collective selfhood and identity might come into being.Explore more on these topicsBooksPoetry roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

The BBC Phil were on blistering form and, late-night, the Estonian Philharmonic Choir were immaculate even if the programme felt a little blandFlora WillsonFri 1 Aug 2025 08.14 EDTLast modified on Fri 1 Aug 2025 08.16 EDTShareEven among the staunchest classical music lovers, the phrase “star clarinettist” rings false. Compared with celebrity pianists, violinists and singers, virtuoso woodwind players don’t get much time in the spotlight. Yet Swedish clarinettistMartin Fröstisn’t just capable of technical wizardry, but is also amesmerising, full-body performer. On stage at the Royal Albert Hall, he danced, struck poses and contorted himself like a rock icon shredding a guitar solo. All while producing a tone of astonishing refinement, absolutely uniform across the instrument’s multiple registers.Fröst dominated the first half of theBBC Philharmonic Orchestra’s latest Proms outing. Copland’s Clarinet Concerto showcased his ability to blend minutely with orchestral timbres, his solo lines seamlessly interwoven with the cashmere warmth of the BBC Phil’s strings underJoshua Weilerstein. Meanwhile Fröst’s gear-change from the tenderness of its central cadenza into the sassy jazz-infused third section (here all hard-edged articulation and chippy, slightly rustic string playing) was utterly compelling.The much shorter concerto by celebrated jazz clarinettist and band leaderArtie Shawfollowed. Launching with a vibrant sting of trumpets, the BBC Phil sounded every bit like an unusually well-behaved big band with a string section for added pizzazz. Fröst clearly relished every glissando, every tricky corner of vocalise, every flight into the squeakosphere. By the time he demanded audience participation in his encore (Gounod’s Ave Maria, with Fröst playing Bach’s original prelude in C major as the audience sang), I suspect we’d have done anything he asked.Bookending the Fröst show: the short, beguiling Symphony No 2 by recently rediscovered French composerElsa Barraine– its modernist angularity offset by hints of jazz, aerated by gracefully sculpted solos from the BBC Phil’s own excellent wind players – and a taut, high-octane performance of Rachmaninov’s Symphonic Dances. Weilerstein approached the latter’s many hairpin bends like a racing driver with a title in his sights, cleaving a direct line through changes of tempo and mood, drawing out colours that morphed from the ultra-dry to utter suavity in the central waltz, before letting rip in a thrilling, wild ride of a finale – the closing triumph of an orchestra on blistering form.View image in fullscreenTõnu Kaljuste conducts theEstonian Philharmonic Chamber Choirat the Royal Albert Hall.Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCThe late-night prom couldn’t have been more different. CelebratingArvo Pärt’s 90thbirthday year, theEstonian Philharmonic Chamber Choirperformed various vocal works by the Estonian composer (most in their first Proms performances), alongside a Bach motet, a couple of numbers from Rachmaninov’s All Night Vigil and two short works by Pärt’s Estonian contemporaries. Most were a cappella; Kadri Toomoja provided the minimal accompaniment demanded on organ and piano.Under Tõnu Kaljuste, the choir’s fine-grained blend sounded almost studio-produced and their intonation was remarkable, open fifths and octaves ringing brilliantly into the dome. Yet even the kaleidoscopic late-night lighting couldn’t distract from the lack of variety in this blandest selection from Pärt’s musical world. OnlyVeljo Tormis’s haunting Curse Upon Iron, accompanied by shaman drum and climaxing in a blood-curdling collective scream, offered a glimpse of something more – but also felt entirely out of place amid the wall-to-wall soothing triadic harmony.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

The original album was confounding and exhilarating in equal measure, thanks to its canny fusion of EDM rave-up synths and blown-out hip-hop beats. Alongside the rise of producers such asClams Casino, it spoke to a post-financial crisis millennial generation finding much-needed euphoria in electronic maximalism. Now, gen Z-beloved artists such as Bladee and Nettspend are reviving an even bigger, bolder version of that sound, and finding huge cult audiencesView image in fullscreenBut perhaps that’s why Electronic Dream 2 – while engrossing and atmospheric, capturing AraabMuzik’s trademark fusion of dread and debauchery – almost feels meek. Some songs, such as the smeary, blushing Til You Drop, capture the hallucinatory brilliance of the original album. Others, such as opener 3AM and the moody Half a World Away, feel more like generic beat tape cuts, in part because AraabMuzik’s sound has been so influential that it now seems a little rote.Dubbing the album a sequel to Electronic Dream may have been a mistake: the grand trap track Reach Out is imposing and scary, building to a dense cacophony, but it feels out of place on a sequel to an album with such a defined sound. It’s an understandable impulse to make a sequel: rappers have done it for years, and nostalgia-bait has become a dominant form of popular art – to the point that Madonna has been teasing Confessions Part 2. But for an innovator such as AraabMuzik, moving on seems the best path.Explore more on these topicsElectronic musicHip-hopDance musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Influenced by local favela street parties, the 24-year-old producer takes the distorted bass, Afro-Brazilian rhythms and vocal melodies of baile funk – a dance genre that originated inBrazilin the 80s – and adds a darker palette of reverb-laden vocal lines, rave sirens and buzzing synths to create a style he calls bruxaria (witchcraft). Vieira’s 2023 debut Pânico no Submundo was a 15-track introduction, harnessing the sound of blown-out speaker cones. Radio Libertadora! moves into even bolder and louder territory, developing his nascent genre into a source of dancefloor chaos.View image in fullscreenOpening with a sample of a 1969 radio speech bythe revolutionary Carlos Marighella, which called on people to act against Brazil’s military dictatorship – and gives the album its title – Vieira sets the tone for the record as an energetic riposte to thecurrent criminalisationof baile funk street parties. In his bruxaria universe, the beats are hard, vocals are screamed and bass is explosive, creating an overwhelming, apocalyptic sound. Mega Suicidio Auditivo features siren squeals, thunderous bass, radio jingle samples and shouted lyrics within the first 20 seconds, while Sua Filha Quer Os D layers rap verses and synth melody over the Islamic adhan call to prayer. Techno de Favelado veers seamlessly from harsh Berlin techno to trance and baile funk rhythm while featured Meduza tries to make herself heard.Vieira displays immense skill in balancing his arrangements and allowing each element, no matter how brash, to play clearly without collapsing into muddy loudness. Some listeners may find it too noisy, but succumb to Vieira’s relentless energy and there is freedom in the barrage of sounds – an invitation to lose yourself in the cacophony.Also out this monthAustralian ensembleHand to Earthrelease their latest album Ŋurru Wäŋa (Room40).

Stir in the kirsch, if using, then transfer the jam to a small bowl and leave to cool.To make the white chocolate cream, put the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a small pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted, then leave to cool to tepid.In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter with the paddle attachment on medium-high until smooth. Beat in the cream cheese, then pour in the melted chocolate and kirsch, if using, and mix until smooth. Add the cream, beat to soft peaks, then cover and chill for at least an hour (and up to two days).To make the crepes, sift the flour, cocoa, icing sugar and salt into a medium bowl. Make a well in the centre, crack in the eggs and whisk to break them up. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to form a smooth batter, then beat in the melted butter and vanilla.(Alternatively, put everything in a blender or food processor and blitz smooth.You’ll need one large crepe (at least 23cm) and 10 smaller ones (about 20cm). When ready to cook, set a large (25cm), nonstick crepe or frying pan on a medium heat. Add a little butter (about a quarter-teaspoon) and swirl it around with a piece of kitchen paper. Pour in 80ml of the batter and swirl to get a thin, even layer. Cook for about a minute, then flip and cook the other side until lightly golden. Transfer to a plate.Swap to a smaller (20cm) nonstick crepe or frying pan and heat well. Repeat the above process to make 10 smaller crepes, adding a swipe of butter and using a scant 60ml batter each time. Stack and cover the crepes as you go.To assemble, lay two long pieces of clingfilm perpendicular to each other on a worktop to form a large cross. Put the large crepe in the centre and spread a thin, even layer of white chocolate cream (about 80g) over the surface. Place a smaller crepe in the centre and spread with about 50g of cherry jam. Continue layering, alternating between 50g cream and 50g jam, finishing with a plain crepe on top.Once all the crepes are stacked, gently gather the edges of clingfilm up and over the cake, pulling firmly so the larger crepe curves up around the edges of the stack of small crepes. Twist the clingfilm tightly in the centre and secure with a clip, then transfer clip side up to a large pasta bowl or similar container to help hold its curved shape. Refrigerate for at least three hours, or overnight.To serve, unwrap and remove the clingfilm, invert the cake on to a serving plate so the seam is underneath and dust generously with cocoa powder.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodBakingFruitDessertChocolatePancakesrecipesShareReuse this content"

I’ve got a soft spot for arbitrary wine holidays, so I’m marking the occasion by using it as an excuse to spend the weekend guzzling one of my favourite white wines. I’ve given you notice (sort of), so off you go to your nearest independent or supermarket to pick up something racy and saline.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It used to be thought that the albariño grape was brought to Spain by the French monks of Cluny, but that has since been disproved, with no parentage between albariño and burgundian varieties. Rather, the grape is now believed to be an ancient variety that’s native to the Iberian coast, with a naturally thick skin providing resistance to the diseases a humid climate can give rise to (alvarinho is the grape’s name in northern Portugal, where it’s essential in the production of easy-to-love vinho verde).The wines it produces are direct and acidic, with an unmistakable mineral salinity. It’s often unoaked, but some producers are having fun by experimenting with barrel-ageing their albariños to give them extra weight and depth. Such wines are often drunk a little later, but most albariño is designed to be drunk within a couple of years of its release.But why August for World Albariño Day? Why not deepest, darkest winter or the yawning, stretching spring? My guess is that it’s because the stuff goes down like a homesick mole and works with pretty much anything you’d want to eat when it’s hot and sticky outside. Which makes sense when you think of Galician cooking, or indeed other coastal regions that grow albariño, where the cuisine is defined by seafood. What grows together goes together, and all that.A friend of a friend in Galicia says albariño hasaguja, unlike most other Spanish wines. The word translates as “needle”, and relates to the verve of top, high-acid albariño, whose unique electricity is best paired with very simple seafood, preferably cooked in salt water, as they do in Galicia.“It’s my go-to picnic wine,” says Jeff Koren, director of wine atThe Chancery Rosewood in Mayfair, who loves albariño so much that he once worked a vintage at the vauntedBodegas Albamar. “I want to drink it with crudites, Greek salad, prosciutto or jamón with melon, while I’d pair the cool, textured, barrel-aged stuff with anything I’m eating in the summer heat.”The grape’s harmonious relationship with coastal regions has brought it to various corners of the world where the vineyards benefit from cooling maritime climates. Areas of New Zealand, California and South America are all producing their own interpretations of this wine, so there are plenty of options for your albariño day celebrations. Apologies for the rather late notice, it will almost definitely happen again.Four albariños to tickle the tastebudsM&S Albariño Uruguay£10 Ocado, 12%.
