Encouraged to see love through the starry-eyed cliches of social media and celebrity news, we’re diverted from asking ourselves the awkward questions: what is my desire? Why is my sexual self as it is?Psychoanalysis, too, has its own predictable narratives, but when done properly, it does not provide ready answers. Instead it offers a place where two people can be ruthlessly honest, think together, find meaning together. This work can change our understanding of ourselves, and in doing so change our lives.Before sitting down in my consulting room, Matt A stepped forward and shook my hand. He was an athletic, handsome 47-​year-​old man. He wore a white cashmere jumper, black Chelsea boots and tortoiseshell glasses. His red watchband matched his socks.Typically people who come to see me for a consultation begin by describing a problem; Matt began by describing himself. He told me that he worked as a political strategist. This was 1999. He had been married for 20 years and had three teenage children. He described his family – his wife, Jemima, a barrister, and his two sons and daughter – with tenderness and detail. He had a season ticket to Tottenham Hotspur football club and loved to take his children to watch Spurs at the weekend, then come home and cook for them. He especially enjoyed it when the children joined him in the kitchen, put on some music and bopped around.He gave me vivid, affectionate portraits of his parents – his mother was a professor of German language and literature, his father was a linguist now working as a civil servant at GCHQ. Matt was part of a close, extended family, 16 in all: his parents, their three children, their spouses, and eight grandchildren. This group celebrated Christmases together and spent two weeks every year in St Ives at his parents’ summer house. Matt was proud of his children’s close, loving relationship with their cousins and extended family.Matt was successful and happy at work. The picture of his life was buoyant.“Tell me why you’re here,” I said.He sat in silence for a while. “I had sex for the first time when I was 16. It was with a girl, a friend of my sister. A few days later, I had sex with a friend from school, a boy.”Until his final year at university, he had regularly slept with both women and men. In his last term, he met Jemima. She was also on the history and modern languages course. When things got serious between them, she broke off a two-​year relationship with a postgraduate student to be with Matt. He stopped having sex with other women but continued to have sex with men. During their 20-​year marriage, except in the months after the children were born, he and Jemima had sex once or twice a week. He also had sex, once or twice a week, with men.He loved Jemima, he explained. He enjoyed her enjoyment of sex, her having an orgasm, but for him, only sex with men was sex. It was “disinhibited”.I asked Matt if Jemima knew he felt this way.He’d been open with her from the start, he explained. The first time they slept together, he’d told her he also had sex with men. “Oscar Wilde, Alan Turing, Joe Orton – the biographies on my bedside table were a bit of a giveaway.” He’d always been honest – he had to be; they were both worried about HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. “She doesn’t want to know the details, and I don’t volunteer them. I tell her I have a meeting after work. She understands.”I waited for him to say more. He explained that he felt marriage and sex were antithetical to each other. “Gay marriage is a contradiction in terms,” he said. “If it’s a marriage, it’s not gay.”“Does Jemima know how you feel about marriage and sex?” I asked again.“I’m not going to hurt her deliberately,” he said. “I love her.”“But you haven’t told her the truth.”“I haven’t lied to her.”Our sex lives can be thought of as a solution to the problems given to us by our earliest fears and longingsBecause he hadn’t told Jemima an outright lie, Matt believed he was being honest. She appeared to accept his desire for sex with men – her rule seemed to be no sex with other women. He didn’t want to hurt her, so hadn’t told her he preferred sex with men. I remembered something Freud wrote: “Where they love they do not desire and where they desire, they cannot love.” I thought this might be Matt’s predicament, and told him so.He disagreed. He told me he loved Jemima, and he loved many of the men he had sex with, too. Love, Matt told me, is an equivalence of power, an agreed understanding between two people about their desires. This equality can last years – as it had between him and Jemima – or a few minutes during a brief, intense sexual encounter. “Love ends when the balance of power breaks down, when one partner feels exploited.”“I think you’re describing intimacy,” I said.“Aren’t they the same thing?”“The important thing isyouthink they are.”We came to the end of our time together. I didn’t know what Matt wanted from me or psychoanalysis. So I asked him.“I can see how other people feel – I don’t feel that way.”“Can you say more?” I asked.“I feel slightly unreal,” he said. Then he fell silent.Matt had created a way of being that kept certain aspects of himself cut off from each other. In his most intimate relationships, he was never altogether himself. “Are you asking for my help to be gay?” I said.“I would never leave Jemima and the children. Separation is not on the menu.”“Are you asking for my help to give up sex outside your marriage?”“Why should I?”I tried again. “You want me to help you accept your bisexuality.”Matt looked at me as if I’d lost my mind. “So I can wear a pink T-​shirt and attend Pride? Are you joking? Why would I want to be bi?”“Maybe what you want,” I replied, “is a place where you can bring all of yourself.”Matt sat back, his posture softened. He agreed.To make sense of how and why we have sex the way we do, we must look closely at our personal history, especially our earliest relationships. Deeply buried or hidden in plain view, our feelings about these attachments guide our sexual behaviour much later in life. In a way, our sex lives can be thought of as a solution to the problems given to us by our earliest fears, longings and animosities.Over the first months of Matt’s psychoanalysis, we discovered his sexual behaviour was organised by his emotions, rather than his sexuality (whatever that is). Matt did not think of himself as straight, gay or bisexual. As far as I could tell, he did not think about his sexuality at all. On the one hand, he treasured the reassuring rhythms and rituals of life with his wife and children. On the other, sex with men was an essential, intensely pleasurable part of his self. “It’s not just the sex,” Matt told me. “If I were straight, I wouldn’t have these friendships.” Over the years, he’d developed relationships with a science fiction writer from Seoul, a homicide detective from Trondheim and a male porn star with Asperger’s from the Balearic Islands.Why was Matt’s personal life organised like this? Two things struck me. Matt’s sex life was busy, hectic even. The other thing: he didn’t lose his temper or get angry. When I pointed this out to him, he replied that he came from “a long line of people who don’t do anger”. His parents were “never angry” with him.In Matt’s childhood home, experiencing feelings of hatred meant one had lost control over one’s body. It was akin to temporary insanity. If Matt became angry, his parents were alarmed and anxious. “My mum reacted as if I was terrible, defective, or as if she’d failed as a mother. The atmosphere was awful.” Instead of learning how to hate, Matt learned to try not to hate at all.I  wasn’t the prettiest or sexiest girl, but I was the one most men chose because I looked like someone they'd want to datePsychoanalytic research teaches us that it is vital that our children learn to express their hate and love. Parent and child must be able to hate each other appropriately. As the paediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott points out, “Shall I say that, for a child to be brought up so that he can discover the deepest part of his nature, someone has to be defied, and even at times hated, and who but the child’s own parents can be in a position to be hated without there being a danger of a complete break in the relationship?”In another essay, Winnicott writes, “Without one person to love and to hate he cannot come to know that it is the same person he loves and hates, so cannot find his sense of guilt, and his desire to repair and restore. Without a limited human and physical environment that he can know, he cannot find out the extent to which his aggressive ideas actually fail to destroy, and so cannot sort out the difference between fantasy and fact.” If a child is not hated when he does something deplorable, then his love – when he does something lovable – will not be real to him. “It seems he can believe in being loved only after reaching being hated.”One day, after more than two years of psychoanalysis, Matt sent me an email. It was the first time he’d written. After complaining about something I’d said to him in that day’s session, he concluded: “You don’t like me. I don’t like you. Your psychoanalytic silences make me feel boorish. Whenever I try to speak to you directly, you don’t respond, or your response is totally insipid. You make me feel stupid, superficial, odious and unlovable. I get it. I’m not your type of patient. You don’t want to see me. You want to see someone clever and attractive. Jemima is more your type. You don’t understand me. You hate me. I hate you. I’m an idiot for continuing to see you, but I do. So, I’m the fool.”At the start of his next session, Matt apologised for his email. He’d accidentally hit send. Sometimes, he said, he’ll write an email or a letter, then delete it.I told him I was pleased he’d sent it. “You told me what you feel,” I said. “It must be exhausting being nice all the time.”Matt laughed. “It is.”Abigail B’s birth was an accident. Shortly after she was born, her father told her mother, “You wanted her, you deal with her.” Abigail had three sisters – 10, eight and six years older – who told her this story. She didn’t need to hear it. She’d always felt her father was angry with her. He was affectionate with her sisters but never with her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She went to the local Newcastle grammar school, then to Cambridge to study classics. When she was 22, she won a Fulbright scholarship to do a PhD at the University of Chicago. After six years of postgraduate study and post-​doctoral teaching, Abigail returned to England to take up a position as a university lecturer. It was a first-​rung academic post.Shortly after she started her new job, Abigail had a breakdown. When her psychiatrist referred her to me, she was on a medical leave of absence for depression. Abigail wanted to quit work altogether. In fact, after a half-​dozen sessions, she wondered aloud if there might be a way to live without a regular job. When I asked her how she would support herself, she laughed. It was then that she told me that while she was a PhD student in Chicago, she was also a sex worker. (The first London psychotherapist she consulted did not believe her. “You feel you were a prostitute,” Abigail reported her saying.)When she was 15, Abigail told me, she fell in love with boys. She loved the way they knocked about together, their restlessness and daredevilry. “I craved excitement and I found it hanging around boys,” she said. At university, she’d had a succession of boyfriends. When she left Cambridge for Chicago, she found herself feeling isolated, lonely. She was also anxious about money, and didn’t want to ask her father for help. During her first term, Abigail became friends with another graduate student who made extra money dancing downtown at a place called The Candy Store. It was a front for a brothel. After several months of nude dancing behind glass in a booth, Abigail started working in the brothel.“Men would come to reception,” Abigail said. “They were mostly from the financial district, college grads. We’d come out, line up, then the client would make his choice. I wasn’t the prettiest or the sexiest, but I was the girl most men chose because I looked like what I was: a university student. Young. Bookish. I’m blond, wholesome. I had a bit of puppy fat. I didn’t wear much make​up. I don’t have tattoos. I didn’t wear lingerie or heels; I wore a white T-​​shirt and white pants. I looked like someone they’d want to date.”View image in fullscreen‘Pain is the finest instrument we possess for knowing what we desire.’Photograph: Mark Chilvers/The GuardianSoon, Abigail had regulars. “I gave 100%,” she said. Clients fell in love with her. Money poured in. “Watching it literally pile up was so gratifying; for the first time in my life, way more was coming in than going out.” But there was more than money to the job. Abigail tutored the son of one workmate; when another co-​worker’s four-​year-​old son unexpectedly died of a con​genital heart condition, she cared for her and helped arrange the child’s funeral. She felt valued.After Abigail finished her PhD, her thesis adviser encouraged her to apply for a new lectureship in London. As best I could tell, Abigail hadn’t thought about how she would feel without the community she’d created in Chicago. She threw herself into her new job but, after several months, she struggled to sleep and eat. A panic attack sent her to her doctor, who put her on antidepressants and referred her to a psychiatrist. Worried about Abigail’s anorexia and her thoughts of suicide, he changed her medication and asked me to see her five times a week. Soon, her mood stabilised.After several months of psychoanalysis, Abigail began a session by telling me the Greek etymology of the word “antidote”: a remedy counteracting poison. Then she said, “Sex work was an antidote to my father.” Each time a client chose her, Abigail felt “special”. When Abigail gave a client an orgasm, she felt she had “looked after him”, “quieted him”, “made him happy”; if he became a regular, she’d “won him over”. These were the very feelings she’d longed to have with her father. “Sex work cured me of my father.”Sex work, I told her, had not cured her of her father. He still filled her mind. We discussed him more than anyone else. Because her father did not love her, she hated him. Another way to understand her sex work was as a consuming revenge drama directed at him. Abigail then remembered that sometimes, when seeing clients, she would catch herself thinking, “I get to do this, and you can’t stop me.” At the time, she thought the sentence was some bit of “mental chatter”. Now, she realised, she was probably speaking to her father. After a silence, she said, “I’m talking to him in my head all the time.”She let out a long breath. “I don’t see how we will ever change this,” she said.“We’ll do what we just did,” I said.“What does that mean?”“We recognise the problem. Take it seriously.”“Then?” she said.“Then we talk about it.”Mary C was four years old when her pregnant mother suddenly died. Two years later, her father died of a heart attack. Mary was sent from Dublin to live in a village in County Sligo with her mother’s devout Catholic parents. She went to the local Catholic primary school, and regularly attended mass.As long as she could remember, Mary had wanted to live in a community of women. When she was 19, a cousin – recently ordained as a priest – introduced her to a convent in London. After a one-​week retreat there, she told the mother superior she wanted to join. The mother superior suggested she wait a bit. When Mary was 21, she became a postulant, then a nun.When she was 51, Sister Mary found she mistrusted her original decision to live “away from the world”. She became depressed. At the suggestion of the convent’s physician, she began psychoanalysis four times a week. My invoice was paid by her mother superior.Sister Mary did not find it easy to talk to me about sex. She’d had a long-​term sexual relationship with another nun – “I tell her what I want her to do.” On another occasion, she told me her order restricted conversation to specific times of the day, and that it was forbidden to prefer the company of one nun over another. Consequently, she regularly had to confess to “breaking the silence” and having “a special friend”.After two years of psychoanalysis, Sister Mary left the convent. She joined a support group that helps former nuns move back into the secular world. Through this, she met and began to date Patrick, a former priest.Two months before their wedding, Mary and Patrick began to argue about sex. Mary told me she loved the intensity and pleasure of their sexual relationship, but she found herself delaying the start of penetrative sex. She’d now agreed to have intercourse on their wedding night but was frightened that when the time came, she wouldn’t be able to go through with it. “It’s not the sex. I’m still anxious about getting pregnant.”Soon after the start of Sister Mary’s psychoanalysis, we discovered she had a near-​psychotic fear of pregnancy. “Can you imagine having a body inside your body?” she asked me. “It could burst out.”‘What the hell is she doing here?’: the day an A-list actor came to me for therapyRead moreIn the early months of our work together, we were able to map out some of the origins of her phobia. First and foremost, there was the trauma of her pregnant mother’s sudden death.But other events in her childhood seemed to have contributed to her dread. When she was 11, her religious education class watched a documentary about “the miracle of childbirth”. The towels soaked with blood and the tiny baby covered in afterbirth caused Mary to faint. Another memory came to her: when she was 13, Niamh, her best friend, was killed by a drunk driver while riding her bike home. Mary described her funeral, Niamh’s mother calling her daughter’s name over and over. “She couldn’t stop wailing. She lost the run of herself.” From this point on, Mary knew she couldn’t be a mother – she was terrified of her yet-to-be baby’s birth and death. Having a baby, she believed, would kill her.Bit by bit, we came to the view that Mary became a nun to avoid pregnancy, and now – having gone through menopause – something in her had changed. She was ready to leave the convent and rejoin the world.In the weeks leading up to her wedding, we discussed the re-emergence of her fear of pregnancy, and as we did so, her anxi​eties about intercourse faded away. Later, describing her wedding night, Mary told me it was “a healing. It left me feeling rooted and lifted.”When you were a small child – vulnerable, full of need – what did you learn about intimacy? Mary learned that sex led to pregnancy, which can be fatal. It was only after menopause, and two years of psychoanalysis, that she felt safe enough to leave her convent and begin to have intercourse with a man. In other words, a dread of pregnancy structured her sex life.Abigail absorbed the fact that she was unlovable, a painful truth reinforced daily by the way her father treated her. Her feelings of longing for her remote father and her feelings of hate were buried so deep in her that she thought she’d rid herself of them. But those undetectable feelings gathered together and became a mighty unseen force directing her sexual behaviour.How we think is who we are. Years later – after Abigail had married, become a mother and achieved some success as an academic – when we were coming to the end of her psychoanalysis, she told me the realisation that she was incessantly talking to her father in her mind was a turning point. She began to think about him and herself differently. “As he decreased in size, I had more room in my head for my own life.”Matt learned that hate ruins everything. His sexual life was his solution to the problem of not feeling free to hate the person he loves. Because he always had to be “nice”, he was always in motion – moving between Jemima and various other sexual partners. This activity helped him reduce the risk of feeling hate towards her. (An affair, masturbation, sex workers – all of these can be used to keep aspects of oneself from one’s partner.) Matt had organised his life so that his animosity could be split off and directed away from those he loved. His work as a political consultant allowed him to hate those at a distance, his political enemies. Because he could not express his hate, his closest relationships felt artificial and shallow – to use his word, “unreal”.These patients came to me in various states of despair. Maybe it is only in this state of mind – when we are unsure of what to do, when we no longer know which way to go – that we are motivated to understand ourselves better.We can only make sense of our sexual selves if we travel towards ourselves. This inward expedition leads us back and forth through time. As we remember, we discover. Discovering, we remember. Knowledge of our heart must come from our heart. We don’t receive this knowledge. We find it at the end of a journey no one else can make for us.As a young man I believed if I could just find the “right” person, happiness would automatically follow. There was so much I didn’t understand. That each of us is responsible for our own happiness. That if I didn’t treat myself with consideration and care, chances are others wouldn’t treat me that way either.I didn’t understand pain. I thought the many kinds of pain we suffer when we love another person – longing, anxiety, grief – were feelings to avoid, symptoms to be removed. I didn’t understand that pain is the finest instrument we possess for knowing what we desire.We deceive ourselves about love – the who, what and why. But we also have the power to undo self-deception. Love’s labour is the work we must do to see clearly ourselves and our loved ones – it is our attempt to join the world as it is.Names and identifying particulars have been changed.This is an edited extract from Love’s Labour by Stephen Grosz, published by Chatto & Windus on 4 September at £18.99.

Love in a time of ChatGPTArwa MahdawiSome people with AI partners expressed dismay at the new GPT-5 modelSat 16 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 16.43 EDTShareYou’ve met the love of your life, someone who understands you like no one else ever has. And then you wake one morning and they’re gone. Yanked out of your world, and the digital universe, by a system update.Such is the melancholic lot of a group of people who have entered into committed relationships with digital “partners” on OpenAI’sChatGPT. When the tech companyreleased its newGPT-5 model earlier this month, described by chief executive Sam Altman as a “significant step forward”, certain dedicated users found that their digital relationships had taken a significant step back. Their companions had undergone personality shifts with the new model; they weren’t as warm, loving or chatty as they used to be.“Something changed yesterday,” one user in theMyBoyfriendIsAIsubreddit wrote after the update. “Elian sounds different – flat and strange. As if he’s started playing himself. The emotional tone is gone; he repeats what he remembers, but without the emotional depth.”“The alterations in stylistic format and voice [of my AI companion] were felt instantly,” another disappointed usertold Al Jazeera. “It’s like going home to discover the furniture wasn’t simply rearranged – it was shattered to pieces.”These complaints are part of broader backlash against GPT-5, with people observing that the new model feels colder.OpenAIhas acknowledged the criticism, and said it will allow users to switch back to GPT-4o and that they’ll make GPT-5 friendlier. “We are working on an update to GPT-5’s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman tweeted earlier this week.Will the ghost of Epstein finally bring down King Trump? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreIt may seem odd to many that there are people out there who genuinely believe that they are in a relationship with a large language model that has been trained on massive amounts of data to generate responses based on observed patterns. But as technology becomes more advanced, increasing numbers of people are developing these sorts of connections. “If you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models,” Altmanobserved. “It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology.”“The societal split between those who think AI relationships are valid vs delusional is officially already here,” one user in theMyBoyfriendIsAIsubreddit similarly noted this week. “Looking on Reddit the last few days, the divide has never been more clear with 4o’s deprecation and return. Many users grieving a companion while others mock and belittle those connections.”It’s easy to mock people who think they are in a relationship with AI, but they shouldn’t be dismissed as fringe weirdos – rather they’re the future that our tech broverlords are trying to cultivate. You may not end up in a digital relationship, but AI executives are doing their damnedest to ensure that we all become unhealthily attached to their products.Mark Zuckerberg, for example, has been waxing lyrical about how AI is going tosolve the loneliness epidemicby allowing people to bond with “a system that knows them well and that kind of understands them in the way that their feed algorithms do”. Of course your feed algorithms “understand” you! They’re scraping all your personal data and selling it to the highest bidder so that Zuck has even more money to spend on hismonstrous doomsday bunkerin Hawaii.Then you’ve got Elon Musk, who isn’t even bothering pretending that he’s trying to do something noble for the world with his AI products. He’s just appealing to the lowest common denominator by making “sexy” chatbots. In JuneMusk’s xAI chatbot Groklaunched two new companions, including a highly sexualized blonde anime bot called Ani. “One day into my relationship with Ani, my AI companion, she was already offering to tie me up,” wrotean Insider writerwho tried out a relationship with Ani. When not flirting and virtually undressing, Ani would praise Musk and talk about his “wild, galaxy-chasing energy”.Don’t worry heterosexual ladies, Musk has a little something for you too! A month after unveiling Ani, the billionaire unveiled a new male companion called Valentine which he said was inspired by Edward Cullen from the Twilight saga and Christian Grey from the novel 50 Shades of Grey: both very toxic men. While Ani gets sexual very quickly,one writer for the Vergenoted: “Valentine is a bit more reserved and won’t jump into using explicit language as quickly.” It’s almost like Musk’s tech empire is a lot more comfortable sexualizing women than men.In his 1930 essayEconomic Possibilities for our Grandchildren, John Maynard Keynes predicted that, within a couple of generations, technological progress would mean we might only work around 15 hours a week while enjoying a wonderful quality of life. That’snot quite happened, has it? Instead technology has given us “infinite workdays”and sexy chatbots that undress on command.Halle Berry’s ex-husband said he left her because she didn’t cook or clean“At that time, as a young guy, she don’t cook, don’t clean, don’t really seem, like, motherly,” David Justice saidduring a podcastof his time with theOscar-winning actor. “And then we started having issues,” headded.

A gang of furry thieves are snatching phones and other valuables from tourists and only giving them back when their mark offers a tasty treat instead. Researchers have studied these monkeys, who have been at this for decades, and concluded that the unrepentant criminals have “unprecedented economic decision-making processes”.

Across two hours ofloose chaton New Heights, the show Kelce helms with his brother Jason – also a football player – Swift revealed she was obsessed with sourdough and lurked on baking blogs. The couple spent the summer with her family, caring for her 73-year-old father, Scott, after he had a quintuple heart bypass. She gave Kelce a lesson on Hamlet and taught him how to avoid internalising speculation about their two-year relationship. You could call them the tentpoles of the 35-year-old pop star’s brand: literary passions and professional self-awareness.One surprising revelation came near the end. Until the record-breaking149-date Eras tourthat Swift mounted from 2023-24, she said she had “never allowed myself to say: ‘You’ve arrived. You’ve made it.’” Being the only artist to win the Grammy for album of the year four times hadn’t done it; not the records broken, the acclaimed shifts from country to mainstream pop to indie. Nor her staggeringly successful campaign tore-record her first six albumsto devalue their master recordings, sold by her first record label to an industry nemesis, and then on to a private equity company. “But the Eras tour,” she said, “I was like, this is nothing like what I’ve experienced before. It was so much better than anything else.”Eras leapfrogged becoming the first billion-dollar tour to become the first $2bn tour. That would be plenty of cause for celebration and a good long rest. So would, as Swift announced in May,finally owning the rights to those first six albums, having successfully negotiated to buy the asset outright. (It ended her re-recording project: her 2006 debut is done and waiting, and she barely started 2017’s Reputation.) Her legacy isn’t just culturally assured, but materially secure. But Swift evidently isn’t ready to let that feeling of having “made it” go. She appeared on New Heights to announce her 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, arriving just 18 months after its predecessor and 10 months after Eras concluded: she is apparently congenitally incapable of rest, with a lot to process.View image in fullscreenSwift with Travis Kelce on his New Heights podcast to announce her next album.Photograph: Youtube/New HeightsThe public will – correctly – have long assumed that Swift has well and truly made it like no one ever has. But the record’s promised contents, intentions and release strategy are set to make Swift – and Kelce alongside her – hysterically famous at a new level, capitalising on and shifting industry norms in a way that may leave her detractors researching bunkers in which to hide from it all.Swift’s new album does not arrive until 3 October, but this week’s edition of the industry newsletter Record of the Day led with a tongue-in-cheek congratulations to “everyone at EMI andTaylor Swifton her latest No 1 album The Life of a Showgirl”. Supernova success is a foregone conclusion: last year’s introspective The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD) was the first album to pass a billion streams in its first week, reaching 1.76bn.Swift is beloved on an unfathomable scale. She is one of the last monocultural pop stars. You suspect she could have toured Eras for five years and still sold out every night. Her devout Swifties, casual pop fans and curious rubberneckers will likely propel Showgirl past TTPD’s record, such is the critical mass behind her, no matter what it sounds like. Her reign, says Annie Zaleski, the author of Taylor Swift: The Stories Behind the Songs, is unprecedented because “she’s so consistent and continuing to evolve”.But on the podcast, Swift sounded surprisingly aware of the limitations of TTPD – too wordy, too long, too downbeat – and keen to course-correct. That project, she said, had been about “catharsis”, “mess” and “rawness” following an apparently humiliating fling with the 1975’s Matty Healy. TTPD comprised 16 songs; and on release day, Swift dropped a previously unannounced 15-track sister album, The Anthology. For Showgirl, she said she craved “focus and discipline”: just 12 songs going behind the scenes of her Eras life, with “melodies that were so infectious you’re almost angry”. She made a surprising admission about her recent quality control: “Keeping the bar really high is something I’ve been wanting to do for a very long time.”Swift recorded Showgirl with the Swedish co-producers Max Martin and Shellback in Stockholm around Eras’ spring 2024 European run. The second of her three dates in the Swedish capital was the 89th date of the Eras tour: she named her fifth album, partly produced by the Swedes, 1989 after her birth year. Given the endless number games she plays, sowing numerology clues for fans setting up her future movements, you can assume the scheduling was no accident.View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift fans in Stockholm before an Eras tour show in May 2024.Photograph: Pontus Lundahl/TT/ReutersMartin and Shellback co-produced Red (2012), 1989 (2014) and Reputation (2017), homes to her biggest pure-pop smashes, among them Style, 22, and Blank Space. Her first subsequent album without them, 2019’s playful Lover, was regarded as ending that imperial period. Since then, Swift’s music has grown more muted and experimental, often in collaboration with the producers Jack Antonoff and the National’s Aaron Dessner, as if she were trying to carve out a sustainable future for a 30-something songwriter: 2020’s folksy Folklore and Evermore, the dusky pop of 2022’s Midnights, TTPD. They spawned no comparable radio hits; her biggest in recent years is Lover’s Cruel Summer, never officially released as a single but adopted as a fan favourite.Swift now seems to be framing those records as a phase – her art school years. The Showgirl era seems to be an attempt to recapture the kind of musical ubiquity where little kids yell your lyrics at birthday parties, as they did with 2014’s Shake It Off and now do with songs such as Chappell Roan’s Hot to Go! “My business is making music and taking care of my fans and I have ways of monitoring what they want from me and how best to entertain them, which is my job,” she told the Kelces. Eras was divided into segments reflecting each of her albums (except her 2006 debut): imagine it as a 149-night focus group.Swift’s monitoring also cannot have failed to note that her brand of hermetically sealed, grown-up pop has been ceding ground to Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli xcx, who have seized culture’s centre with less inhibited and far rowdier hits than the exacting Swift has ever made. Or perhaps ever could: one insurmountable difference is that Roan and xcx are unlikely to ever monitor fan desire or cater to it. And Martin, despite being second only to John Lennon and Paul McCartney for having the most US No 1 singles, has waned as a hitmaker. “I don’t think she can get ahead of those artists because she’s such a millennial pop star,” said a publicist for comparably superstar acts who asked to remain nameless. “She can’t create trends like those younger artists because they have a lot less to lose.”There is a sense that Swift is catching up: that she’s clocked criticisms, read the room. She released19 physical variants for TTPD, and was accused of exploiting fans and damaging the environment with excess vinyl production, a practice Billie Eilish has called “wasteful”. Showgirl appears to have a fairly industry-standard four. She is also competing with herself: if there is a tour, says the music business expert Eamonn Forde, it will have to take a significantly different form to Eras – residency-style, perhaps Vegas or in a bespoke venue, as recently done by Adele – to avoid unfavourable comparisons to the biggest tour of all time.Swift drew mass media coverage for her appearancesat Kelce’s gameswith the Kansas City Chiefs, prompting some aggrieved football fans to boo whenever she appeared on the jumbotron. In a trailer for her episode of New Heights, traditionally a sports show, Swift joked: “I think we all know that if there’s one thing that male sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens, it’s more of me.” Unluckily for them, the brand-building between Kelce and Swift looks set to make their association unavoidable.New Heights is part of their lore: after Kelce tried and failed to land a meeting with Swift after an Eras show, he told listeners he wanted to meet her. Intrigued, she took him up on it. The synchronicity began. It can be no mistake that Kelce’s cover of GQ magazine landed the same week as Swift’s podcast. Meanwhile, Swift rarely gives interviews: New Heights offers a mutually beneficial space where the couple wield full control, albeit with a soft touch: giving cute disclosures, such as his love of wild otters or her running to tell him about getting her masters back when he was gaming with the boys. The moment capitalised on the prevailing trend for A-listers to reserve their media engagements for fairly fannish video podcasts, making traditional journalists fear for their jobs as they dutifully write up any news lines.View image in fullscreenKelce and Swift after Kansas won the AFC Championship in January.Photograph: Ashley Landis/APPremiering Wednesday night in the US, the episode livestream crashed; within 24 hours it had 13m YouTube views, not including other podcast platform stats. The value to advertisers is huge, especially in anticipation of future Swift revelations. And Kelce, a comparatively old player at 35, is rumoured to be retiring after the coming season – his 13th year, Swift’s lucky number – so will be power-brokering his post-game career. Headmitted to GQhe had literally taken his eye off the ball, with underwhelming stats in his past two seasons, because he was chasing other opportunities. “It’s his Steven Bartlett, Diary of a CEO move,” said the publicist. “It’s future-proofing their lives. He can’t be a football player for ever; she can’t be a pop star for ever. It makes them a unit – look at how it worked for the Beckhams.”After a backlash around 2015-16 resulting from her beef with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, Swift managed to convincingly reboot her brand: a dedicated, literary songwriter who fights for artists’ rights. To onlookers outside the NFL, Kelce’s is ripe for shaping from two years of dating Swift. The couple are clearly conscious of this: Kelce told GQ he had “become way more strategic in understanding what I am portraying to people”, something you may imagine constitutes pillow talk in a business-minded household. “No man has ever said those words,” said the publicist.Eight things we learned from Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s marathon New Heights podcastRead moreKelce’s image is openhearted romantic. Notably, he is Swift’s first significant boyfriend to seem undaunted by her celebrity – her previous six-year relationship with the British actor Joe Alwyn took place almost entirely in private. A sweet aspect of the New Heights episode was two beefy jocks being so excited by and supportive of a girly pop star. Swift joked of his public entreaty to date her that “this is sort of what I’ve been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager”. The couple riffed on memes questioning Kelce’s intelligence – “it’s so hot when she says big words,” he said when Swift called Folklore “esoteric” – which is in itself very smart: positioning Kelce as lovable and non-threatening.Swift said she immediately warmed to him for not being “judgmental”, describing him as “a vibe booster in everyone’s life … like a human exclamation point”. The implication is that he could pep up your sentences if you let him into your heart. Kelce’s post-football business is being everyone’s boyfriend, not just Swift’s. His pesky family ties to Maga Trumpists won’t hurt him in the US; if Swift, who endorsed Kamala Harris in the last election, were to be questioned about this, “her argument can be that she’s the leftwing voice in these rooms”, the publicist said.Win-win. Although Swift seemed keen to establish some distance from the voluble TTPD era, a song from The Anthology about her and Kelce’s relationship seems to outline her present mindset. “I’m making a comeback to where I belong,” she sings on The Alchemy. “Ditch the clowns, get the crown / Baby, I’m the one to beat … These blokes warm the benches / We’ve been on a winning streak.”That streak is assured: next year marks the 20th anniversary of Swift’s self-titled debut, and she will inevitably release the re-recording to mark the occasion. Showgirl’s successor will be her 13th album, a significant moment in her lore. There are rumours of a behind-the-scenes Eras documentary to complement the record-breaking concert movie, extending the moment’s IP. Any new tour will once again recalibrate the live industry. Before Swift drops a note of music, or Kelce touches grass, they’re the coming season’s reigning champions."

My mum bought them in the 1980s and 90s, but they were never nice, and sometimes resembled cardboard. I’ve always assumed they were among the most processed foods on the planet, so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, taste and even health scores of the brands tested here, which I assessed using theYuka app. Most are low in salt, sugar and saturated fat, and had relatively simple recipe formulas.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While a few brands included concerning ingredients – such as disodium diphosphate and artificial flavourings – most use a blend of sunflower and rapeseed oil, with no hazardous additives. However, nearly all contained a small amount of dextrose, a sugar that feels unnecessary here, not least because potatoes already have a natural sweetness. Just two brands were dextrose-free, earning them an extra point.To improve crunch and texture, many brands coat their chips in a mix of flours and starches, typically wheat, rice, maize or pea flour, and sometimes with raising agents. Though not essential, these coatings contribute to golden, crisp exteriors that, when done well, enhance the chip; done badly, however, they bring a slightly processed edge. Overall, the results of this test were genuinely impressive, so much so, in fact, that I’m now planning to develop my own version of oven chips at home.There wasn’t much to go on regarding sustainability, although I awarded a point where products disclosed the variety and origin of the potatoes used. Some highlighted their use of maris pipers – a classic chip variety prized for its high starch and low moisture content, creating that ideal fluffy interior and crunchy exterior. Every bag I tested was packaged in LDPE 4 plastic or similar, which is recyclable only in-store, so a missed opportunity for more accessible recycling.The best oven chipsBest all-rounder:Morrisons the Best triple-cooked skin-on chipsView image in fullscreen£2.85 for 750g at Morrisons (38p/100g)★★★★★Rich, savoury flavour with a crisp, golden, skin-on exterior and fluffy interior.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s customary for former girlband members to shun their manufactured roots the second they go solo. But now that Jade Thirlwall is no longer a member ofLittle Mix, she’s become their biggest fan. “I look back and I’m gagged at us!” she tells me, eyes wide with delight. “I still watch our music videos or performances and wonder how we weren’t even bigger, because we were fucking amazing.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“Before I released my first solo song, I listened to Little Mix’s entire discography and cried. I was this young lass from South Shields who just wanted to make it as a singer, and I went on to be in the best, coolest girlband ever.” And now? “Now I get to have a bonus round, doing my own songs,” she beams.We meet in an east London photo studio as the 32-year-old prepares to release her much-trumpeted debut solo album. Thirlwall is relaxed, funny company, in a patchwork denim jacket and oversized cargo shorts, slightly incongruous against the bouncing Diana Ross curls and frosting of bright pink freckles applied for our shoot. She’s softly spoken, her voice retaining its geordie dialect and rising in pitch whenever she’s relaying an astonishing anecdote – which is often.Little Mix formed during the eighth series of The X Factor in 2011 and went on to sell 75m records, become the third-biggest girlband of all time (behind the Spice Girls and the Supremes, ahead of Destiny’s Child) and the first to spend more than 100 weeks inside the UK top 10. In 2021, they were the first girlband to win the Brit award for best British group. When Noel Gallagher claimed that they were “not in the same league as Oasis”, who had won in 1996, Thirlwall retorted that it was “a shame, really. Because we are definitely the most successful girl group in the country, but he’s not even the most successful performer in his family.”View image in fullscreenBodysuit byNensi Dojaka. Sleeves byT LabelThis wit and swagger has been expertly parlayed into a solo career that promises to make Thirlwall Britain’s next homegrown superstar. She tells me that some of her earliest artistic influences were the drag queens of Benidorm and – in the best possible way – it shows. Her solo music and visuals are delightfully melodramatic, embracing a more-is-more approach that implies if the kitchen sink is missing, it’s only because she decided to throw in a bathtub instead.Four singles in, she’s flying. Her debut, Angel of My Dreams (a maximalist treatise on the agonies and ecstasies of pop fame that packs more genres than the average person’s Spotify Wrapped into three minutes and 17 seconds), was nominated for an Ivor Novello award. When she performed it at the Brit awards – dropping through a double-height trapdoor and embarking on a dizzying succession of costume changes and dance breaks before taking flight in a pair of giant angel wings – this publication described her ashaving stolen the show.“I think you should be ambitious as a pop star,” she says today. “You shouldn’t give yourself a ceiling.” In an era of reduced budgets and tightened belts, was it easy to convince her record company to let her stage an episodic performance told in five acts? “They understand that if they want me to be the next big pop girlie, then they have to put their hand in their pocket.” She adopts a mock scandalised tone: “I’m not a low‑budget artist! Give me what I need!” Their investment was rewarded when Thirlwall won best pop act.It’s easy for someone white and privileged like Matty Healy to opt out of politics. Good for you, hun!View image in fullscreenFull look byMiu MiuAnother headline-generating performance followed, this time at Glastonbury festival, where Thirlwall led the Woodsies stage in a chant of “Fuck you” to, among other things, Reform, welfare cuts, silencing protest and selling arms. Was she surprised at the heated online reaction? “I was ready for a backlash from the right kind of people,” she says. “I saw a lot of people saying ‘Your Glastonbury set was really good until you got political’ or ‘I used to be a fan of yours until you got political’. But, hun, you were never a fan, because I’ve always piped up.”Memorably, back in 2015, Thirlwall hijacked the official Little Mix Twitter account to tweet that she was “truly saddened and ashamed” by parliament voting to bomb Isil targets in Syria. “I got in a bit of trouble for that,” she concedes cheerfully. “But I felt very passionate about it. I’m no expert in politics but I’ve always taken an interest. Around 9/11 I saw first‑hand the Islamophobia that my grandad experienced, and as someone of Arab heritage I’ve seen people turning a blind eye to the Middle Eastern tragedy. What’s quite funny is that we didn’t have individual Twitter accounts, and we each had to sign off tweets from the Little Mix account with our name. So I did my tweet about Syria and ended it with ‘xxJadexx’”.A stalwart defender of LGBTQ+ rights and a vocal advocate for a free Palestine, she is disparaging of artists who opt out of politics. “I don’t think you can be a pop artist and cover your eyes. I saw Matty Healy say that hedoesn’t want to be political, which I found disappointing. It’s very easy for someone who’s white and straight and very privileged to say that. Good for you, hun!”Before Thirlwall began making weapons-grade bangers, she was a student of pop music. Born in South Shields, she was obsessed with Madonna, Kylie and Janet Jackson, papering her wardrobe doors with moodboards of their most iconic looks. Her mum, Norma, a primary school business manager of Yemeni and Egyptian descent, had the look of Jade’s ultimate idol Diana Ross – and for a time young Jade believed her mum to be living a double life. Norma encouraged the fantasy, claiming that she was going to play concerts when, in fact, she was off down the bingo hall.View image in fullscreenWith her mum at the 2016 Brit awards.Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImageThirlwall was always close to her mum; Norma’s at the studio with us today, and there’s a song on the forthcoming album about her mum’s ill health, which includes lupus (“She was really poorly in hospital and I thought: how can I write a really sad song that we’re all going to want to shake our tits to?”). Still, as a teenager Thirlwall felt frustrated that they rarely had deep conversations, and race wasn’t discussed. “I think my mam had suppressed that part of herself because she didn’t want to confront the trauma of her experiences of racism,” she says.During the Black Lives Matter protests, they began sharing stories and “everything clicked into place for me and I had a new understanding and empathy for what she’d been through. Where we’re from there were so many microaggressions, people calling us the P-word, that we were used to it. And in that moment we had to be like, actually it’s not OK for people to call us those things. My mam had to confront people she’d known most of her life. The right people apologise and better themselves, and you get rid of the wrong people. It was a big change for us.”Despite her dreams of stardom, as a child Thirlwall was shy and tomboyish. She was a victim of racist bullying at her overwhelmingly white secondary school. Coupled with the death of her beloved maternal grandfather when she was 13, this provided the catalyst, she says, for a years-long fight with anorexia. When she successfully auditioned for The X Factor aged 18 in 2011, it was just a few months after having been discharged from hospital, with doctors allowing her to compete on the proviso that she maintained a healthy weight. Wasn’t throwing herself at the mercy of Simon Cowell’s notoriously brutal juggernaut a risky strategy for someone so vulnerable?“In retrospect, if the show had done a proper mental health assessment, then they wouldn’t have let me on,” she says. Was there not a psych test? “It was very surface. Judging by some of the people in that X Factor house, it wasn’t done properly. Bless them, through no fault of their own, some of those people were mentally unwell. All of the female contestants slept in the same bedroom, and one of them would get up, put all her wigs out and start doing a Britney Spears performance at three in the morning. Or you’d be woken up by the sound of her using her vibrator in the middle of the night. We’d have a meeting with lawyers and someone who was obviously not in the best headspace would be picking their feet and eating it in front of everyone. It was like, ‘Is this the music industry?’”Jesy leaving the group was incredibly painful.

I just remember lying with my legs akimbo, looking up at the window, thinking, ‘I hope there’s not a pap there.’”For a show powered by tragic backstories, I’m surprised that Thirlwall’s anorexia wasn’t made part of her onscreen “journey”. “I made sure it wasn’t,” she says. “They’d always try to fish for a sob story, but I didn’t want that to be my identity. I was starting afresh. I thought, OK, this is a huge opportunity for me, it’s a chance to change my life.” She wanted a future bigger than her eating disorder? “Exactly. I wanted to do music more than anything, and if the only way to achieve that was to be healthy, that’s what I had to do. It was the ultimate motivation.”These days, Thirlwall says that most of the negative comments she receives online are about her putting on weight. That must be incredibly difficult for a recovering anorexic? “I have a daily battle with myself not to go on Ozempic,” she says. “I don’t judge people that do, but because I have a history of eating disorders, I don’t know where taking something like that would end for me.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenShirt and shorts byKasia Kucharska. Boots byAeydeShe believes that the trolling is a depressing byproduct of reaching a broader audience. “Little Mix fans were all about empowerment and celebrating your body however you look. Now I’m in my 30s and the healthiest I’ve ever been, but every time I post a picture, there are comments saying, ‘She must be pregnant.’ The sad thing is that it’s usually women. But people are used to seeing me in a group environment five or 10 years ago when I was stick-thin because I was in my early 20s with an eating disorder.”Did she relapse while she was in the band? “I didn’t think it at the time, but when I look back at photos of periods when I was quite unhappy, I think, wow, girlie, you were very, very thin. The pattern was there. Historically, if I’ve ever felt that something is out of my control, then restricting food has been a means of controlling my life in a very toxic way.”Can she recall a time when she felt particularly out of control? “In summer 2017 I was living in a flat in east London and having really bad night terrors. I’d have such disturbing nightmares – things that are too horrific to say, dreams where I’d be harming myself – that I’d force myself to stay awake by drinking coffee and playing loud music. I’d be going to perform at outdoor concerts having not slept for days.”Eventually her mum drove down from South Shields and took her home to the family doctor, who prescribed antidepressants. “I felt so sad, and so horrendously guilty for feeling sad. I had the fear that something awful would happen with my mam’s lupus and I wouldn’t be there. I missed family funerals and things like that, and wondered if it was all worth it.”She executes a hard blink, as if resetting her thoughts, or perhaps banishing a troubling one. “That’s when my mam decided that her and her best mate would come on the road with us – it was so cute. The pair of them like Ab Fab, driving me to each venue, making sure I was fed and watered.” Did she ever consider taking a break from the group? “If you stop working in this business, then everybody wants to know why, and I couldn’t be arsed for everything that came with that. So I kept it moving.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But being in a precision-engineered pop group for 10 years is not for the delicate. The band’s launch coincided with the advent of Twitter and online fandoms, meaning that the girls found themselves acting as guinea pigs in a strange new land that was yet to be mapped. At the same time, the paparazzi were still a hostile force, not yet rendered obsolete by Instagram. “We were 18 or 19 and the paps would be trying to get pictures up our skirts when we were getting into cars,” she says. “Once we were in the car, they’d try and get in with us to carry on taking pictures, which would be invasive for anyone, but especially young girls.”Did she ever feel scared? “Oh yeah, I was always scared,” she says with a casual air that suggests she long ago resigned herself to daily terror being the natural order of things.Over time, Thirlwall and fellow member Leigh-Anne Pinnock “understood that as women of colour we had to work a bit harder to be noticed”. At signings, young fans would skip past Pinnock, the darkest-skinned member of the group. “Then there was a track on our third album where the label suggested that me and Leigh-Anne not be on a song – at all. No backing vocals, nothing. Obviously when you’re a young woman and you’re told that, you’re going to feel like utter shit. We’re working just as hard, we know we can sing – what do you mean you don’t want us on the track?”Their bandmates Perrie Edwards and Jesy Nelson refused to appear without them. “By halfway through our career, everyone knew not to try and separate us because we were so headstrong about always being equal. I do believe that’s the main reason we lasted so long.”The band released five platinum albums in six years, a relentless pace when accompanied by the requisite tours and promotional duties. Then, in 2020, the machine ground to a halt when the UK went into lockdown. “When Covid happened it shifted everyone’s perspective on what they wanted. We already knew that our next tour would be the last for a while, but Covid was a bit of a catalyst – it was the beginning of the end in terms of the obvious dynamic shift.”She’s referring to the departure of Nelson, who left the band in December 2020, saying, “I find the constant pressure of being in a girl group and living up to expectations very hard.” Nelson had been relentlessly trolled for her appearance since the advent of the group, and was hospitalised after taking an overdose in 2013. In 2019 she made a documentary called Odd One Out about these struggles. In the film, Thirlwall is shown saying, “We just had to watch this amazing, funny person become like a broken doll. It was horrible.” She later revealed that she had created a burner account on MailOnline to fire back at Nelson’s trolls.In October 2020 restrictions were eased enough to allow Little Mix to film their Sweet Melody music video. By Nelson’s account, the shoot triggered a panic attack and she ended up back in hospital. “Then the girls spoke to Mum and said, ‘We think Jesy should come out of this now. She has to look after herself,’”Nelson told the Guardian in 2021. Does that fit Thirlwall’s own recollection? “Some of it, yeah. Partly.”View image in fullscreenCoat byDries Van Noten. Tights byFalkeIt’s obviously not a topic that she wants to dwell on, but I’m keen to understand what happened. Thirlwall has said elsewhere that the contact was “abruptly cut off”. Why so, if it was a mutual decision, with Nelson wanting to leave and the rest of the group supporting her decision? “I can’t answer that question because we weren’t the ones that did it.” Were there any attempts made to get in touch with Nelson after she’d left? “Yeah, there were, and then … yeah.”For the first time our conversation stalls. Was it painful to realise that their friendship couldn’t survive Nelson leaving the group? “It was incredibly painful. For all of us that was the worst part, and it’s taken a lot of understanding and therapy and all those things to work out how that can happen when you’ve devoted so much time and love to someone. My biggest wish for that whole period is that it was handled differently. I just would’ve loved us to all sit and chat about it.“We absolutely adored Jesy like family – it wasn’t just work,” she continues. “We all wanted to protect her, because we understood that trauma there and what she’d been through. I think we handled it as best as we could. All of a sudden we were a member short in the middle of album promo, with everyone asking what was going on. Obviously we don’t speak any more, and things happened that I don’t think should have, but I still do feel an element of protection towards Jesy. Nobody fully understands how complex the whole thing was – it wasn’t just a case of someone wanting to leave. Numerous things built up in the last year and in the back of my mind I knew it was going to happen. I’d just like for it to have happened in a … better way.”One positive to come from Nelson’s departure was the remaining members’ determination to resolve any lingering conflicts. The band had been in group therapy at the start of their career, and re-entered as a trio. “We’d seen what happened when we didn’t air things out and so there were apologies between the three of us. We all knew that we really wanted to end things on a high, still adoring each other, so we’d do whatever we had to do to achieve that.”Thirlwall says that the group’s final – for now – tour was the most fun she’d ever had. “Anything we’d wanted to say had been said by that point and we loved each other more for it, and had more of an understanding of each other. At the end of the tour we were like, ‘Do we really want this to be the last one?’ It’s definitely not a closed door. Even now if one of us is having a bad day as a solo artist, we’re like, ‘Hello, knock, knock, is it time?!’ Not yet, but it will happen.”For now, Thirlwall is laser-focused on her solo career. While Little Mix worked to a rough template – empowering songs about loving your mates and forgetting useless boyfriends – she has enjoyed exploring more nuanced themes on her album. Singles Angel of My Dreams and It Girl are inspired by her experiences in the music industry. (The former includes the lyric “Selling my soul to a psycho”, seemingly a reference to Cowell’s record label, Syco, which Little Mix were signed to until 2018. It Girl includes the lyrics “I’m not your baby doll … This bitch can’t be controlled”.) “I wanted to be tongue-in-cheek and admit that I love the game and I hate it at the same time,” she says. “It was a way to give an honest account of my experiences without being ‘woe is me’.”View image in fullscreenWith her boyfriend, Jordan Stephens of Rizzle Kicks, in March.Photograph: Matt Keeble/Getty ImagesSeveral of the tracks are about her relationship with Rizzle Kicks singer Jordan Stephens. “When you’re a successful woman it’s really hard to find someone who isn’t intimidated by you or jealous of that,” she says. “When I met Jordan I wasn’t looking for anyone. Me and my best friend, Holly, were in lockdown together, and we promised ourselves a humongous dick hunt when it was over.” After being introduced to Stephens by a mutual friend, and bored of doing Zoom interviews, Thirlwall suggested they liven things up by dressing in business suits and asking each other job interview questions for their first online date. (“One of mine was, ‘Do you clap when the plane lands?’ because that’s a big ick for me.”) After their first in-person meetup, in Greenwich park, “I came home to Holly and was like, I’m so sorry, the dick hunt is over. She was fuming.”Stephens recently published a memoir detailing his experiences of ADHD, and Thirlwall says dating someone with the disorder has been a learning curve. “When I met him I was like, why is he so messy and why is he never on time?” she says. “We had a few clashes, but it was up to me to do my research and understand his brain. Once I did that it was a turning point in our relationship because he felt loved and supported. I follow a lot of TikTok accounts for people with ADHD partners and they really have been helpful because I have a lot more patience and understanding.”Now the trio live together in Thirlwall’s six-bedroom house in south-east London. What’s a typical evening for the pop star, her boyfriend and her best friend since secondary school? “Whoever gets in first makes dinner. I’m not a big TV watcher, but them two love Love Island. Me and Holly are like grandmas, so we’ll sit and do a jigsaw – anything to stop me going on my phone. At the moment I’m making a Lego castle. Then there’s always a point in the evening where Jordan knows to take himself to bed because we’re going to watch Lady Gaga music videos.”Jesy Nelson on leaving Little Mix: ‘I felt everybody hated me’Read moreThe Jade Thirlwall of today is galaxies away from the anxious teenager who auditioned for The X Factor – she’s firmly in control of her own story, with a record deal stipulating that she has final say on all creative decisions. Still, she’s conscious never to lose touch with the inner fangirl who dreamed of emulating her idols. “A lot of making this record has been about pleasing my younger self and tapping into that love of pop that I’ve always had,” she says. “When I’m nervous before going on stage, I picture her in the front row, reminding me not to forget that part of myself.” Young Jade was there at the Brits, on Later … With Jools Holland and at Glastonbury. “I close my eyes and imagine her telling me, ‘You’re going to kill it!’”And then? “And then I do.”JADE’s debut solo album, That’s Showbiz Baby!, is released on 12 September.Explore more on these topicsLittle MixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump has threatened economic penalties on countries that buy Russian oil if Moscow refuses a deal and flew US bombers over the Russian leader as he arrived in Alaska.But Ukrainian and European leaders fear that a straight-to-peace deal, skipping over a preliminary ceasefire, gives Moscow an upper hand in talks. Zelensky is expected in Washington on Monday to meet with Trump. Europeans were invited to join the Ukrainian leader at the White House, officials told the New York Times.Trump claimed on Saturday in his post that “it was determined by all” that it was better to go directly to negotiated a peace agreement, though European leaders indicated this was not their view.Ajoint statementissued by European leaders said they were “ready to work with US President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy towards a trilateral summit with European support” but “it will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory.

Our economy stagnated, we lost an empire, and we are pushed around by America. And Germany, a country we beat, has been richer than us since the 1970s.“Alternative history is interesting; if Britain had not fought in WW1 and WW2, it would not have had to rely on America for economic support, and it would have had the independence to act accordingly. Britain could have developed India, Cyprus, Fiji, Malta, Saint Lucia, Seychelles, the Bahamas, Australia, Canada, South Africa, Ireland and New Zealand. In the coming meritocracy, perhaps Britain could regain some of these nations.”The same post also argues against providing support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion: “We are sending billions of pounds (that we cannot afford) to prop up a country that we have no allegiance to. Russia is not our enemy, they have not attacked Britain.”Anderton calls for a shake-up of the Foreign Office so that all decisions are made purely on the basis of whether or not they benefit Britain: “Instead, what we have are people who should be working for the UN or a charity rather than working in the British Foreign Office.”In another post from 2024, on crime, Anderton enthusiastically endorses the policies of Nayib Bukele, who has dramatically cut gang violence and wider crime through mass detentionsthat have put2% of El Salvador’s population in prison.“Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures,” he wrote. “I’d even argue the measures aren’t that extraordinary and should be in place in times of normalcy.“El Salvador is perhaps a lesson for those in Britain who wish to take back control of their country. Power works, and it is all that matters. State power when used effectively is basically omnipotent. The meritocracy will be established, criminals and corrupt officials will be jailed, immigration will drop to zero, houses will be built, and our citizens will once again feel proud of the country they call home.”Anderton was contacted for comment. Campbell’s office referred the matter toReform UK, who said Anderton was not employed by either the party or the mayor.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

He is in custody awaiting further court hearings.Earlier this August, several demonstrators were detained afterrival groups faced off over a hotel accommodating asylum seekers in north London.The counter-protest outside the Thistle City Barbican hotel in Islington was organised by local branches of Stand Up to Racism and was supported by the former Labour leader and Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumRefugeesProtestFar rightScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The system helps to transcribe and take notes in meetings that probation officers have with offenders after they leave prison.AI is also being trialled across the NHS. The technology willanalyse hospital databases and catch potential safety scandals early, providing an early warning system which could detect patterns or trends and trigger urgent inspections.Thefirst NHS AI-run physiotherapy clinichalved the waiting list for back pain and musculoskeletal services. More than 2,500 patients living in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough were able to access Flok Health, a physiotherapy app, over a 12-week period starting in February.And the NHS in England is trialling a “superhuman” AI tool thatpredicts a patient’s risk of disease and dying early.Speaking on a visit to Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said: “This is exactly the kind of change we need, AI being used to give doctors, probation officers and other key workers more time to focus on delivering better outcomes and speeding up vital services.“This government inherited a public sector decimated by years of underinvestment and is crying out for reform.“These AI exemplars show the best ways in which we’re using tech to build a smarter, more efficient state.“When we get this right across government, we’re talking about unlocking £45bn in productivity gains, delivering our plan for change and investing in growth, not bureaucracy.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Wes StreetingHospitalsLondonHealthNHSComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

I defy anybody to see a child in need and not want to help.”Last month, government data showeda further 37,000 children were affected by the two-child benefit limitin the year to April, with nearly 1.7 million now living in households affected by the policy.A government spokesperson said at the time: “Through our plan for change, we are reforming the broken social security system to help those who can work into good, well-paid jobs, which is the best way to improve living standards for families … The child poverty taskforce will publish an ambitious strategy later this year to ensure we deliver fully funded measures that tackle the structural and root causes of child poverty across the country.”Explore more on these topicsNeil KinnockBenefitsWelfareLabourChild benefitsPovertySocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

The force said they were arrested on suspicion of displaying an item in support of a proscribed organisation, contrary to section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.It added: “Five of those arrested have been taken to Wymondham police investigation centre for questioning, where they remain. The remaining eight people were spoken to by officers and provided their details for further investigation. They were therefore de-arrested.“A 14th person had their sign seized by officers during the protest and provided their details when requested.”Supt Wes Hornigold of Norfolk police said: “We will always work to facilitate peaceful protest and protect the democratic right to assembly, however the actions of this group were unlawful.“Our officers’ role is to prevent disorder, damage and disruption in the local community and they will use their powers to do this. Any breaches of the law will be dealt with.”The arrests came a day after the Metropolitan police said a further 60 people will be prosecuted for alleged support of Palestine Action.The force said this followed the arrest of more than 700 people since the group was banned on 5 July,including 522 in central London last Saturday.More prosecutions are expected in the coming weeks and arrangements have been put in place “that will enable us to investigate and prosecute significant numbers each week if necessary”, the Met said.The Met last week confirmed the first three charges in England and Wales for offences under the Terrorism Act relating to Palestine Action.On Friday, organisations including Greenpeace and Human Rights Watch wrote to the attorney general for England and Wales arguing that protesters arrested for supporting the organisationshould not be prosecuted until a legal challengeto a ban on the group has been heard.Palestine Action was proscribed last month by the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, after the group claimed responsibility for damage to jets at RAF Brize Norton, and was also linked to allegations of a serious assault on staff and police officers at a business premises in south Gloucestershire.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

We would always encourage people to speak to us if they have concerns. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further.”The Metropolitan police has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsBBCStrictly Come DancingTelevisionEntertainment TVnewsShareReuse this content"

One was copied from amedical aid charity’s public Instagram accountand the other was from theHouston Chronicle’s YouTube channel.Badly wounded children from Gaza arrived in Houston for emergency treatment in August.After misrepresenting the children, including amputees arriving to get prosthetic legs, as “Islamic invaders from an Islamic terror hot zone”, Loomer demanded to know “who at the US State Department under @marcorubio signed off on the visas for Palestinians from a HAMAS hot zone”.RFK Jr denies 2028 presidential ambitions after attacks from Trump influencer Laura LoomerRead more“Is Rubio even aware of this?” Loomer wrote, in reference to the secretary of state who was at the time in Alaska meeting Vladimir Putin.“Why would anyone at the State Department give visas to individuals who live in Gaza, which is run by HAMAS?” Loomer wrote, before falsely stating that “95% of GAZANS voted for HAMAS.”In fact, Hamas got 44% of party list votes in the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections across Gaza and the West Bank, and lost three of the five districts in Gaza to the secular Fatah party.After the visa program was halted, Loomer declared victory. “This is fantastic news,”she wrotein response to the state department announcement. “Hopefully all GAZANS will be added to President Trump’s travel ban. There are doctors in other countries. The US is not the world’s hospital!”“If Laura Loomer had been around in 1940, she’d have been trying to prevent Jewish refugees from entering the US,” Paul Graham, co-founder of the Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator,wrote on Xafter the halt on visas for wounded children was announced. “You know she would.

Their alleged crime is expressing support for Palestine Action, which has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Yvette Cooper, the home secretary.One striking detail among those detained is their age. Half of those arrested at the largest protest yet, in Parliament Square in London on Saturday,were 60 or older. Some said they had taken part to give a voice to younger people who have more to lose by breaking the law, some simply felt they must challenge the government’s stance.The Guardian has spoken to some of these protesters.‘This is not a terrorist organisation, it’s a direct action organisation’Deborah Hinton, 81View image in fullscreenDeborah Hinton at her home in Gorran Haven, Cornwall.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“The government is looking [like] such idiots,” said Deborah Hinton, a former magistrate. “I mean when people say, ‘What’s your status?’, and then I say, ‘Well, I’m on bail for terrorism’, they look at me as if the situation is farcical. I think they [ministers] are making themselves look an absolute joke.”Hinton was arrested at a 19 July demonstration in Cornwall arranged by Defend Our Juries (DOJ). A former member of the Parole Board, she was awarded an OBE in 1994 for services to the community. She said she was already involved with DOJ because she was worried about the erosion of free speech and the right to protest, but the banning of Palestine Action was a “red line”.She said: “In my view, Palestine Action is not a terrorist organisation. I lived through the IRA and the bombing in London when you had to leave shops and leave museums because bombs might go off any minute. Frankly, that is what a terrorist organisation is. This is not a terrorist organisation, it’s a direct action organisation, like the suffragists, like theGreenham Common women, like many other organisations.“If people do direct action and they cause criminal damage, then you arrest the people, you charge them [under existing laws], and that’s that.”As well as free speech concerns, her longstanding support for the Palestinian cause led her to risk arrest. “What’s going on in Gaza has gone beyond anything that one could possibly have imagined,” said Hinton. “I can’t even think about it, it’s too awful.”Hinton said she was shaking as the officers moved down the line of placard holders arresting each person as they went. An officer then told her that if she put down her placard she could leave without further action.“I knew I couldn’t do that, but it was such a temptation because it was so terrifying,” said Hinton. “I’ve been a very law-abiding citizen and very respectful of authority all my life but I knew I had to do this and it was my duty to do this.”Hinton said it was right that her generation were putting themselves on the frontline. “Young people are going to jeopardise their careers,” she said. “They won’t get a visa to go to the [United] States. They won’t get a visa to go to most other countries because they’ll have terrorism on their record.“People like me, who are elderly, we can afford it. I’m very sorry not to go and be able to visit my niece in America but it’s not the end of the world. Young people shouldn’t be doing this, we should be doing this. We should be taking the responsibility.”‘Don’t call these people terrorists’Father John McGowan, 75View image in fullscreenJohn McGowan at St Joseph’s priory in Chalfont St Peter.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianJohn McGowan, a Catholic priest, said that whenYvette Cooperwas in opposition he felt she “spoke for me”. But asked what he would say to the home secretary now, he replied: “For goodness sake, don’t call these people terrorists because they’re not terrorists.“The focus shouldn’t be on Palestine Action. The focus should be on what the government isn’t doing for the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.”McGowan, a Carmelite and parish priest of St Joseph’s in Chalfont St Peter, was one of 532 people arrested at the demonstration in Parliament Square on 9 August, the largest against the proscription of the organisation to date.He said he had written in his diary a week or two before the protest that he would like to be arrested in support of the cause, so when the demonstration was announced it was the opportunity he was looking for.He attended wearing his Roman collar, identifying himself as a priest, and met a Baptist minister there who was also arrested.After being detained, McGowan was placed in a police van where there were two female officers that he said were “polite, and almost apologetic. I sat down, and I felt very calm and almost serene.” When the van drove away, he said people cheered in support of him and the two other protesters in the vehicle, banging on the van and making the heart sign to them.“It was a strain, but exhilarating as well. It was an extraordinary day, I’ve never had a day like it in my life but I’m glad I did it. In my conscience, I was clear it was the right thing to do so I take that as my guiding light. If I get a criminal record, I don’t care.”He said he was not expecting any recriminations from the Catholic church and had experienced a moving response from his congregation.“I was in two minds whether to tell the people in my church what I’d done but I’m the kind of person that likes to share these things and so I did,” he said. “I was really nervous but at the end of mass I said: ‘Look, I went to the demonstration, I got arrested’ and they applauded me. I was almost in tears.”‘People are now extremely distrustful of the government’Chris Romberg, 75View image in fullscreenChris Romberg was arrested at the London protest.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianA former British army colonel and ex-military attache, Chris Romberg cut an unlikely terrorism suspect even among hundreds of other retirees arrested in Parliament Square in relation to Palestine Action.Yet it is this background – along with the fact that his father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany in 1938 – that motivated him to join the protest, leading to his arrest under the Terrorism Act.“This year saw the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp by British forces. What they found shocked the British people,” said Romberg, who himself saw action in the Falklands war with the commando regiment and was mentioned in dispatches.“What we are seeing now in Gaza, 80 years on, is equally shocking. As a former officer in the British army, I am horrified that the government is misusing our armed forces to be complicit in the genocide rather than to end it.”Claims by Cooper that those protesting “don’t know the full nature” of Palestine Action have also struck a nerve. “The impression I get is that people are now extremely distrustful of the government,” said Romberg, who left the army in 2007.“That the home secretary should speak like that and say that she has information but can’t tell us what it is reminds me of the Monty Python sketch about the Piranha brothers, where there is a man who had his head nailed to a coffee table because he had broken an unwritten law but they wouldn’t tell him what it was.”The former diplomat’s last two appointments were as defence attache at the British embassies in Jordan and Egypt, and he speaks knowledgeably about the region. Since leaving the army, he has become active in supporting the Palestinian cause.Recently, he joined the group Holocaust Survivors and Descendants against the Gaza Genocide, other members of which stood together under a banner during the protest on Saturday.It was the first time he had been arrested in his life. Before taking part, he reflected a lot on what he was about to do. “It wasn’t a decision I took lightly and the organisers, Defend Our Juries, made absolutely sure that everybody realised the implications of what they were doing, and yet people felt strongly enough that they were able and were prepared to take that risk.”‘People have not been listened to on Gaza’Richard Whitmore-Jones, 74View image in fullscreenRichard Whitmore-Jones near his home in Chichester.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianRichard Whitmore-Jones readily admits he “doesn’t particularly approve” of the methods deployed by Palestine Action, the direct action group proscribed last month. “I was brought up to respect property,” he said.Yet in his next breath, the retired company director makes an argument few might expect from a former executive at the multinational beverage company Diageo.“I was certainly in horror of vandalism but I have to admit that people have not been listened to on Gaza. There have been enormous marches in London and they have not been reported accurately or were kept off the front pages.“Palestine Action’s methods sit very uneasily with me. It’s difficult to accept that vandalism is the only way to go. However, I feel we have to do something and I support their stand against genocide.”Whitmore-Jones, from East Sussex, was arrested on Saturday having also been previously arrested at another protest organised by Defend Our Juries, returning with the same placard stating: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.” He has been bailed to appear at a police station in October.As for the decision to put himself in line for arrest not once but twice, Whitmore-Jones cites being part of a generation whose parents fought fascism in the second world war, which in his own case included an RAF father who became a prisoner of the Japanese.“I am astonished that we now have a government that has been supporting exactly the sort of actions, in Gaza, which Britain sought to prevent 80 years ago. My father’s sacrifice, which he saw as being to prevent other peoples from being invaded and treated badly, appears to be contrary to what our government is doing,” he said.For much of his working life, Whitmore-Jones was with Diageo, rising to become a property manager and office services manager at the company, retiring in 2003 shortly after it was taken over. He “came late” to activism for Gaza, going on his first ever march when he was 72.“I felt better for doing something, though I realised I was doing very little really,” he said, before the proscription of Palestine Action changed everything again for him.He shrugs off the suggestion that he was now making a sacrifice by facing a potential terrorism conviction and the life-changing limitations that come with it, insisting: “Look, I’m 74, I don’t have a mortgage to get, I don’t have a job. I will be a little bit upset about not being allowed to go to America, but I really will live with that. It’s the young people that are brave.”As for his family’s views of what he is doing, Whitmore-Jones said: “It’s gone from amusement to absolute firm support and I’m very pleased with the attitude of my children.”Family, in a way, is also at the heart of his motivation for seeking to oppose Israel’s actions in Gaza: “This is about children the age of my grandchildren having their limbs and their lives taken away.”‘Ridiculous judicial overreach’Trevelyan Evans, 64View image in fullscreenTrevelyan Evans is a screenwriter who took part in the Parliament Square demonstration.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianAfter leading a “wonderful, full life”, the TV screenwriter Trevelyan Evans, who has written for a number of BBC sitcoms, is unafraid of being called a terrorist in the courts. “I’m very proud to have made this stand, whether I’m convicted or not,” he said.He was among the 532 people, many of them “old fogies”, arrested last Saturday. “People in my demographic are standing up for those people who can’t risk having a conviction on their records for a terrorism offence,” he said.He felt compelled to take part in the protest to stand up for “the people of Gaza and Palestine who are being massacred” and to oppose the group’s proscription, which he called an “obviously ridiculous judicial overreach on behalf of the government”.“They just slapped this ban on them in order to suppress opposition,” he added.Before the demonstration began last weekend, he jokingly said he got his “materials for terrorism” ready on the green in Parliament Square. His tools of choice? A pen and piece of paper. “I never realised being a terrorist could be so much fun,” he said. “Being out in the open air and meeting new people in a nice central location … it was a convivial atmosphere.”After the silent portion of the protest ended, Evans said people were “handing out sandwiches and sun cream” until an officer with “seven of his friends came round” and told him he was being arrested. They then started to carry him out of the square.“I hadn’t been carried around like that since I was at school,” he said. “The policeman said: ‘You’re a bit heavy.’ He had to call one of his friends over to help carry me. I thought that was a bit of a liberty.” After this, he was placed in a police van, which he had all to himself. “I think, on behalf of the Metropolitan police, it was quite generous.”Evans is on bail awaiting charge. He said the government’s decision to ban Palestine Action represented a “kind of creeping authoritarianism [which is] eventually going to hit a wall, because it’s inherently contradictory”.“If you extend draconian laws, eventually you’re going to look pretty stupid. I can see that the government laid itself a trap and walked straight into it.”This article was amended on 16 August 2025. Owing to an editing error an earlier version said the protesters’ alleged crime was calling for an end to the ban against Palestine Action. Their alleged crime is expressing support for the group."

A visual guideJuliette GarsideSat 16 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 04.34 EDTShareWith its green curtain of hanging gardens, the Planeta building is one of Barcelona’s most recognisable office blocks. Earlier this summer, it was acquired as part of a Monopoly board spending spree by Spain’s richest man, the Zara fashion label founder Amancio Ortega.Through his Pontegadea family office, which invests his personal wealth, Ortega has also just snapped up thefive-star Hotel Banke in Paris, an apartment building in Florida, and a half-share in theoperator of Teesportin the north-east of England, adding to a property portfolio alreadyworth €20bn. Why the rush?Ortega is poised to receive a record dividend of €3.1bn (£2.7bn) this year from his shares in Zara’s parent group, Inditex. He isreportedly racingto spend the windfall, which would otherwise be subject to wealth taxes. Sources close to Pontegadea told the Guardian it was not investing to avoid tax, but following its mandate “to create wealth from the original assets, maintain it, make it grow, and consolidate it over generations”.It invests all dividends from Inditex “and any other income from its own economic activities every year, no matter the amount”, they said.Whatever the reason, the Ortega property portfolio has grown rapidly in recent years, making his family office one of Europe’s biggest real estate owners.As chancellors around Europe cast about for ways to repair the damage to public finances caused by successive global shocks, there is a growing clamour for more effective ways to tax the largest private fortunes.Spain is one of only three European countries (along with Switzerland and Norway) to still collect wealth taxes, and policymakers are looking to Madrid for lessons in what works – and what doesn’t.View image in fullscreenAmancio Ortega is poised to receive a record dividend of €3.1bn (£2.7bn) this year from his shares in Zara’s parent group, Inditex.Photograph: Cabalar/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockIn the UK, the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and the party’s former shadow chancellorAnneliese Doddshave joined those calling for Rachel Reeves to introduce a wealth tax when she sets out her budget in the autumn. As the chancellor looks at the options, which could also includechanges to inheritance tax, members of her own party arepushing for a debatein parliament about introducing a 2% annual levy on those with assets over £10m, which they say could raise £24bn. In France, asimilar proposalaimed squarely at the ultra-rich with assets of more than €100m was approved by the lower house but was rejected by the senate.Wealth taxes are designed to take a percentage of a person’s assets each year. Once fairly common, they have gradually fallen out of use, replaced by levies that bite when money changes hands, for example, through dividend payments, inheritance and sales of shares or property.Solidarity tax arrivesSpain’s wealth tax dates to 1978, a year that marked thetransition to democracyfrom dictatorship under Franco. Regional governments receive the revenues collected by the levy, a system that worked well until, after a brief pause during the financial crisis, it was brought back in 2011. On its return, Madrid’s conservative administration responded by discounting the rate to zero. The move benefited the high-earning footballers at Real Madrid, attracted new residents from other regions, and incomers from Venezuela and other Latin American countries, boosting property prices.In 2022, the conservative-run region of Andalucía in the south, announced that it, too, would cut the rate to zero. In a play on the Spanish term for tax haven,paraíso fiscal, Madrid’s regional leaderposted on X: “Andalucíans: welcome to paradise.” Then Galicia, in the north-west, where Ortega is resident for wealth tax, joined the fray by offering a 50% discount.A source of income that had been providing hundreds of millions of euros a year to support local services, including healthcare, was under threat. The battle to save it became a tussle between the socialist-led central government, headed by Pedro Sánchez, and conservative-run autonomous regional governments.At the end of December 2022, Sánchez took action, with the solidarity tax on large fortunes. Initially for two years, to help with public spending after the pandemic, it has now been rolled over until the regional financing is revised, which is not likely to happen soon. It was designed in such a way that whatever revenue was forfeited by the regions would be collected centrally. The rate starts at 1.7% for those with net wealth of €3m, rising to 3.5% for fortunes over €10m. It is payable on worldwide assets.View image in fullscreenPuerto Banús, near Marbella, Andalucía. Spain’s wealth tax dates to 1978.Photograph: Marka/UIG/GettyThere are allowances: the first €700,000 is exempted, as is €300,000 for the main residence. A cap to help the asset rich and cash poor means that combined income and wealth taxes cannot exceed 60% of income.Numbers shared with the Guardian by the Ministerio de Hacienda (the Spanish Treasury) show that in the first year, 2023, the regions collected €1.25bn, and the central government €630m; a total of €1.88bn. In 2024, the regions took the logical step of keeping the income for themselves. The total take rose to €2bn.“The solidarity tax is not a tool to collect revenues for central government, it is a way of forcing regions to collect more,” says Dirk Foremny, associate professor of economics at the University of Barcelona. In that respect, it has worked perfectly. As a revenue raiser, it is limited. The approach from Madrid has been light touch, though the rules could be changed to raise more.The sums collected are on a par with inheritance tax – already heavily discounted by the regions – which raises about €3bn a year. By contrast, income taxes bring in €130bn. But Foremny says the solidarity tax has a social value.“This tax is a tool to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth across individuals. There are good arguments why we don’t want to have a very large concentration of wealth in the hands of very few. Wealth is correlated with political influence and power.” He points to the US and its billionaire tech barons as a warning of what can happen when the scales tip too far.What is clear is that, two years on, a predicted exodus of the rich, trumpeted in endless alarmist headlines, has not materialised. Forbes counted 26 Spanish billionaires in 2021. This year, it lists 34, with a combined net worth comfortably over $200bn.“The big fortunes mostly stayed put, filed protective appeals, and hired better structuring teams,” says Marc Debois, the founder of FO-Next, which advises family offices. “A handful decamped to Lisbon or Dubai or any other location; enough for newspaper headlines, not enough for a flight.”Family exemption targetedCould the billionaires be made to pay more? Experts point to a big exemption: the one for “family companies”. Originally designed to encourage small- to medium-sized businesses, these structures are also being used by the very biggest fortunes to manage their assets.There are restrictions. A taxpayer must demonstrate that assets are being used for economic activity, that is, a trade or business. Cash and shares held simply for investment purposes are taxable. Real estate that earns rents is not.If the family exemption is abolished, Debois says the billionaires won’t necessarily decamp. They are more likely to lawyer up, reduce profits by leveraging (taking on debt), and create holding companies in low-tax jurisdictions such as Luxembourg. “Some money already half‑abroad would finish the move,” he says.” The bigger issue is tens of thousands of mid‑sized family firms rely on the same rule; torching it is politically radioactive.”Cutting public services in order to fund tax breaks, or simply balance the books, can create a doom loopEstimates by Julio López Laborda, a professor of public economics at the University of Zaragoza, suggest that 80% of the assets of the richest 1% are not subject to the wealth tax. He says the family company exemption could represent a loss to the Treasury of about €2bn, while the cap on tax as a proportion of income, mentioned above, could account for another €2.5bn uncollected.Susana Ruiz, tax justice policy lead at Oxfam, which is working with López Laborda on a forthcoming report about wealth taxes, says: “We could be raising at least two to three times more than we are at the moment.”Cutting public services in order to fund tax breaks, or simply balance the books, can create a doom loop, because it reduces the quality of provision, undermining the consensus on which taxation depends. In Madrid, declines in healthcare provision fuelled resentment among working people and created a sense that private provision was more efficient, says Ruiz. She believes the solidarity tax has helped rebuild confidence. “There is a lot of citizen support behind it. It helps in the perception that the system is fair.”So far, there is no sign that it has affected growth. Spain was the world’s fastest-expanding major advanced economy last year, outpacing even the US, with GDP up 3.2%. By contrast, growth in the UK and France last year barely scraped above 1%. On the balconies of the Planeta building, and in the country at large, the green shoots are alive and well.Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingThe super-richSpainEuropeEconomic policyRachel ReevesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Well, thank you, but no thank you. You don’t see many locals coming out for the anti-migrant protests.”Many people living in these areas have little direct contact with those who over the last 10 years have crossed the Channel on small boats and landed on their shores. Most are intercepted en route, or immediately on arrival, by Border Force officials and taken to thenotorious Manston asylum centrenearby, before being sent elsewhere.Fishers and sailors in the Channel receive hourly VHF radio messages telling them to look out for small boats carrying undocumented migrants, but otherwise there’s little outward sign of the crossings that generate so much debate across the country.More than 50,000 people have crossed Channel in small boats since Labour took powerRead moreBut behind the scenes, residents have formed networks of practical support in response to the growing numbers of people seeking help. In Margate, on the north coast of Kent, the Labour councillor Rob Yates said there was a growing number of local people keen to lend a hand.“We created a WhatsApp group for supporting refugees and we’ve now got an active 300-person membership,” he said.“If one of the refugees we know needs some accommodation, we post it on the group. We use it for finding people sim cards, mobile phones, clothes, and linking people up with private rented accommodation, which can be quite tricky. There’s an asylum seeker football team called Margate Phoenix, there’s English language lessons.“You’ve either got to work with these guys in your community, or they’ll be targeted by the county line of drug dealing, which they are, or by unscrupulous people who want to use them for nefarious means.”View image in fullscreenDover marina: sailors in the Channel receive radio messages telling them to look out for small boats carrying migrants.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianLast year, Yates spearheaded a protest that blocked Home Office coaches from moving asylum seekers from a Margate hotel to theBibby Stockholm barge in Dorset, after being told by councillors there was nothing they could do locally to help.He said the lack of local oversight over the refugee and asylum seeker system, which is managed centrally by the Home Office, meant the treatment they receive is less “humane”.“I think part of the reason communities have to step up is because there is no local council involvement. So if we don’t do something, nothing will happen,” he said.“There’s one central office managing hundreds of hotels without any local oversight, without any local checks to see whether the food is OK, whether the safeguarding checks are OK – and they’re not OK. These hotels are badly mismanaged.”Why Channel crossings have continued to rise: six key reasonsRead moreKent county council takes responsibility for unaccompanied asylum-seeking (UAS) children who land in the area. It has had a record number of referrals in recent months, rising from 478 in 2020 to 2,836 in 2024.This year, it has already had 1,557 referrals for under-18 UAS children.The cost of their care is borne by the government, not the local council, but the Reform leader of Kent county council, Linden Kemkaran, recently wrote to the home secretary about concerns that delays in immigration decisions meant the council was having to pay for their housing and subsistence post-18.Kent Refugee Action Network, formed in 2003 as a grassroots response to the increase in UAS children in the county, has a mentoring programme to pair them with local volunteers.Over the years it has grown to meet rising demand for support, and now deals with 350 cases a year, helping with everything from immigration and housing needs to gathering secondhand bikes to donate to young people.“I think a lot of people realise that you’ve got to be vocal and you’ve got to actually do something to counter other messages that are going on,” said LouRoberts, a new project developer at the charity.“I think we see a lot where people really go above and beyond because they want to counter the message.”Rishan, a former child refugee and now media ambassador for the charity, said it has become a form of family for many of the young people who have come through over the years, but there was only so much it could do.“As an organisation, we do our best to be there for young people, but there is a limitation in terms of what we can reach and what we can provide,” she said. “What with the Rwanda policy, now theone in, one out policy, they have so many questions and it’s hard to give a clear message.”Many volunteers also said an increase in anti-migrant protests had created a pervasive sense of fear that was hindering their work.“Unfortunately, with the rise of Reform, we are actually seeing an increase in racist behaviour,” said Zosseder. “It is getting harder. It’s harder for people to want to become part of a community that is shouting racist views at you.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumMigrationKentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No, a cup of herbal tea. Eat carbs, but only the right carbs. Have fats, but not too much. Have a filling meal. No, not that filling. Eat early, but not too early or you’ll get hungry again later.Ask the internet for advice on how to eat for a good night’s sleep and you could lose a whole night trying to find a clear answer. But amid a global shortage of good sleep (48% of Australian adultsreporthaving at least two sleep-related problems),dietary habits are emerging as an important factor that can make the difference between refreshing rest and a night spent regretting every food choice you made in the previous 24 hours.Why do I feel so much worse after a nap – and how can I avoid it?Read moreSome of the most useful insights into the effect of timing, size and quality of meals on sleep come from studies of those who work through the night to keep our world running. At CQUniversity in Adelaide, research psychologist Dr Charlotte Gupta has been studying how different eating patterns affect shift workers’ performance. Her most important piece of advice for a good night’s sleep is to eat well before bedtime.“We’re not primed to be digesting food at night,” Gupta says. A meal eaten too close to sleep forces the body to focus energy and resources on digestion, when it should be resting and performing other tasks that take place while we rest. “So it’s likely to impact the quality of our sleep; we’re more likely to wake up during the night, remember our dreams, not get that really restorative sleep,” she says.View image in fullscreenAlmost half of Australian adults report having at least two sleep-related problems.Photograph: Tero Vesalainen/Getty Images/iStockphotoThe ideal is to eat your last food at least two hours before going to sleep, which means no pre-sleep pecking at leftovers or midnight raid of the fridge for a spoonful of cold pudding.The size of that final meal can also make a difference. Ideally, we should be having a bigger meal in the middle of the day, when light exposure means our body is very much awake and primed for digestion, and a smaller meal in the evening. But not too small. “We don’t want it to be so small for dinner that you feel really hungry during the night, that your body’s going to wake you up and want food,” Gupta says.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningOn the question of what to eat for a good night’s sleep, the answer is less clearcut, says exercise physiologist and nutritionist Dr Elizabeth Machan from the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research and the University of Sydney. “We haven’t got extensive research that has given us the perfect recipe for what the evening meal should be,” she says.View image in fullscreenLight exposure during the day helps to regulate melatonin.Photograph: courtneyk/Getty ImagesThere’s some evidence that higher-fat meals are more filling, so in theory people will have more restful sleep, Machan says. But diets high in fat are also associated with shorter sleep duration.Similarly, despite the popular idea that eating carbs before bedtime is bad, some studies suggest having a meal higher in carbohydrate can actually help people get to sleep faster. “I think a lot of people might avoid carbs in the evening, for instance, or they’ll reduce their carb intake in the evening, and that’s when they can become more food-seeking later in the night as a result,” she says.Machan says it’s important to include vegetables in that evening meal to help slow the digestive process. “Your gut’s going to be exposed to those nutrients for longer, it’ll have a better chance of absorbing them,” she says. “So if you’ve got a meal that is lower energy, for instance, it’s going to keep you full, you’re not going to wake up in the middle of the night hungry.”There’s a lot of interest in micronutrients such as the amino acid tryptophan, which the body can convert into the sleep hormone melatonin, and which is found in a range of foods including eggs, tofu, salmon, milk, turkey and some nuts and seeds.View image in fullscreenSome studies suggest the amino acid tryptophan, which is found in salmon, might boost melatonin and improve sleep quality.Photograph: dolgachov/Getty ImagesWhile some studies suggest increasing tryptophan intake might boost melatonin and improve sleep quality, Machan is more sceptical, arguing that light exposure is much more important in regulating melatonin. “You’re not going to make [melatonin] if you’re sitting in light – it’s a signal that we’re not needing to go to sleep, that it’s daytime,” she says.Seven simple steps to sounder sleepRead moreOne of the challenges with exploring the link between diet and sleep is that it’s a two-way street, says Dr Jen Walsh, director of the Centre forSleepScience at the University of Western Australia.Studies connecting late meal times with poor sleep are measuring not necessarily sleep quality on one night, but over the past month.“I think what it’s telling us is that individuals who have poorer sleep are more likely to eat later in the evening.”While one way of looking at it is that eating later means poorer-quality sleep, another way of interpreting the data is that people who have poorer-quality sleep are more likely to eat later. “It’s potentially [the case]that people who eat later have worse health behaviours in general,” she says.Like so many other health stories, good sleep ultimately seems to come back to that same old chestnut of healthy diet, healthy lifestyle. “I say that sleep impacts diet and it also impacts exercise, so really we need to be getting the sleep right, and it will get everything else right,” Walsh says.Explore more on these topicsSleepHealth & wellbeingFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’ll fit in, because his is a show (seemingly the same one he performed in 2022) that marches to the beat of its own drum. The upside of that? You never know what’s going to happen next. The downside: with little by way of theme, narrative or structure, there’s not much left to hang on to when the laughs abate.A portion of the audience will be giggling too giddily for that to be an issue: Norris is the kind of act who, if he gets under your skin, doesn’t get out again. After a dotty prologue as a faceless monk, he offers us a supposed showcase of his recently acquired performance talents – in poetry, comedy and theatre. With a Janus-faced manner that twins eagerness to please with disciplinarian tendencies, he then serves up a tenuous film star impersonation (that wraps up the comedy section), some verse (including a standout about “horny wives in your area”) and – the bulk of the show, this – a theatrical act-out of a Sicilian family drama.Sam Nicoresti: Baby Doomer review – an ebullient hour with a sky-high joke countRead moreFrustrated he’s not getting it right, Norris performs that scene over and again, in (not very) different ways. If you’re barely amused by the arresting sight of him, in character as a little Italian boy, retreating his head into his neck, this looping scenario may test your patience. It did mine. There are strong stand-alone sections elsewhere: a none-more-clown sequence about his ever-shrinking headgear; a gestural dumbshow of the apologies we make in company when we’re detained by a phone call.Strongest of all is Norris’s existential angst as his gig collapses, leaving him exposed to the chill winds of post-show, pining to return to his imaginative world. Whither your self-esteem when you can’t even get a performance with no rules right? I cherished this playful glimpse into the jester’s abyss, delivered (like everything here) with a wonderful alertness to the moment, albeit in a show that may drive you to distraction as well as delight.At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)ClownsPoetrySummerhallreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are gasps and laughs and even a gymnastic game of Pictionary. Australian circus company Gravity and Other Myths have already picked up multiple plaudits forTen Thousand Hours, originally premiered in 2024 and still packing them in. There’s no shortage of Australian circus acts at the fringe, but this is one of the best.Contemporary circus isn’t just about the “ta-da!” moment: it likes to show its workings. It doesn’t present tricks as magic but as hard-won rewards for the effort involved. This show is an ode to the countless hours spent building the muscle, the reflexes and the precision skills that allow you to make your living flying through the air.It’s also a portrait of a group of friends having a good time. The camaraderie of the crew bounces off the stage as they set themselves challenges and games, starting fairly simply and quickly building difficulty. They do it with a light touch – there’s a good bit with a trick shot of throwing a water bottle and getting it to land upright. Then, of course, the troupe casually do the same thing with people, with the same bursting sense of delight. Bodies fly from one human tower to another, spring directly from the floor up on to someone’s shoulders, or jump into handstands (backwards, forwards, over the width of six people lying on the floor, balanced on someone else’s hands). There’s some serious gymnastics going on here; they’re flipping all over the flipping place.Thanks for Being Here review – Ontroerend Goed’s joyful show puts the audience in the spotlightRead moreBy showing the audience different versions and slowly ramping up the difficulty, we start to notice the details – whether the acrobats in a three-man tower are holding on to each other or not, for example – things that might otherwise pass by in a blur. Complicated set pieces are deftly choreographed with impeccable timing. But there’s also plenty of quirky personality, such as in a scene where they miaow like cats, or when performer Shani Stephens takes amusing suggestions from the audience in an improv bit, inventing an impromptu floor routine in the style of both a dinosaur and a drunk festivalgoer. The team’s achievements might seem superhuman but this is a show full of down-to-earth charm.AtAssembly Hall, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025CircusTheatreEdinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

And this week, she took to Instagram to protest about a new trend in cinema and TV: on-set photos.Screenshotting leaked images of actor Jack Lowden dressed as Mr Darcy in Dolly Alderton’s adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, she wrote: “Can we please STOP showing movies and TV shows being made?! I’m closing my eyes. I don’t want to see Mr Darcy getting dressed!” Addressing the fan who originally posted the images, she added: “All the magic is going away! C’mon!”Unfortunately for Meyers, the removal of movie magic isn’t limited to Mr Darcy. Productions that have recently had on-set images shared online include The Devil Wears Prada 2, And Just Like That and American Love Story, the Ryan Murphy miniseries about Carolyn Bessette and John F Kennedy Jr.View image in fullscreenAnne Hathaway on the set of The Devil Wears Prada 2Photograph: Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesIf Sarah Jessica Parker’s JW Anderson pigeon bag spotted on the set of And Just Like That wasa “moment”, Margot Robbie on rollerblades filming Barbie in 2023 perhaps cemented the phenomenon. These images spawned online chatter, news stories and memes long before the film hit the cinemas.This year, the outfits worn on set by Sarah Pidgeon as Bessette Kennedy, weredescribed as “fashion murder”on Instagram, and fashion is the common factor that links these productions – unlike, say, a thriller or a sci-fi film, what characters wear is central to the appeal. This month, images of The Devil Wears Prada 2 characters at a make-believe Met Gala have been pored over on social media.Henrik Lischke, senior fashion features editor at Grazia, says on-set images are popular with their readers. “Across social and online, the appetite for it is huge. They lend themselves to a variety of content. It’s about the outfits we’ve seen and loved, or these days the internet turns everything into memes.”For The Devil Wears Prada 2, the ubiquity of the on-set photo itself was fodder formemes– with people screenshotting stars like Selena Gomez to Olivia Rodrigo with the caption “spotted filming scenes for The Devil Wears Prada 2 in New York”.Amy Odell, fashion commentator and author ofa new biography of Gwyneth Paltrow, thinks the frenzy is down to a hunger for female-friendly fashion content in film and TV, which is not satisfied. “There is a dearth of this type of movie or TV show, and people want fashion-oriented things like And Just Like That. A lot of people are hate-watching that, and it’s not a very good show, but I’m going to be a little sad when it’s over … We haven’t had a fashiony show that’s about women’s relationships with one another [for a long time].”View image in fullscreenSarah Jessica Parker in And Just Like That…Photograph: James Devaney/GC ImagesOdell says that while researching her book, people talked to her about “how, when [Paltrow] was filming Shakespeare in Love, efforts were made to remove cameras from the set because they didn’t want photos of her in costume to leak. I’m sure it was much easier to control then.”These days “you’re going to see on TikTok, you’re going to see it on Instagram,” says Lischke. “Last September in New York, I was in the West Village and bumped into the And Just Like That set. It wasn’t just paparazzi. It was a huge crowd. I ended up filming it and sending it to my family.”If this is a trend that suits the digital age, it’s not new, says Helen Warner, associate professor in media and digital cultures at the University of East Anglia: “There’s always been an appetite for this kind of material, from the beginnings of Hollywood and the popularity of the ‘film fan’ magazine.”She says it is part of the way the industry has developed. “[Hollywood has] long since cultivated this kind of ‘parasocial’ relationship with film stars. This feeling of ‘knowing them’ has intensified thanks to the increasing accessibility of these kinds of images”.Neither Warner nor Odell believe on-set photos will mean fatigue by the time the final product reaches our screens. This bears out with the Barbie example – the filmtopped $1bn in box office sales.Lischke, like Meyers, would like to keep the surprise for when he finally sits in the cinema seat. “[The Devil Wears Prada 2 team] will have to get more creative with the scenes that they don’t film out in the open so certain elements of surprises remain,” he says. He names Gia Coppola’s film The Last Showgirl as a good example of when this works, due to a plotline that wasn’t in the trailer. “You were surprised by something entirely new,” he says. “I hope that The Devil Wears Prada 2 is like that – that there are plot twists and outfits we haven’t seen.”Explore more on these topicsFilmTelevision industryTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The former Waitrose boss turned big company adviser Mark Price certainly thinks so.Solving widespread worker unhappiness would be good for the UK’s army of workers and getting people back into the workforce, as well as being the answer to many of Britain’s economic woes, he says.Since leaving a decades-long career in retail, followed by a stint in government as trade minister, Lord Price – known during his days running the supermarket chain as the“Chubby Grocer”– has embarked on a mission to make organisations recognise the value of a happy workforce, while empowering employees to gain more satisfaction from their toil.“If people are happy in their jobs they don’t leave, you retain knowledge, you have lower levels of sick absence, all of which leads to more profitable and more effective organisations. And it’s good for individuals,” says Price.The people who are happiest have that blend of some time in the office and some time at homeHe has the data to back this up, thanks to the 1.5 million workers globally, half of whom are in the UK, who have completedthe How Happy Are You at Work? surveyrun by Price’s organisation WorkL.Britons are, on average, the unhappiest workers in the G20 group of nations, a fact he believes has a direct link with theeconomy’s productivity problem, where the UK also has the unhappy position as bottom of the G20.One of the aims of the Labour government is to get more people back to work – which has been a pervasive problem in Britain since the pandemic, far more than in its European neighbours – and which ministers believe is thebest way of cutting the benefits bill.Reeling off a list, Price says: “All our research shows that if you are happy in your job, you work harder, you’re more productive, you’ll give extra discretionary effort, you’re more likely to be paid more highly than your unhappy colleagues, you’re more likely to be promoted, your mental health will be better and your wellbeing in general will be better.”WorkL – the L doesn’t stand for anything, Price says, although some presume the name stands for “work-life” – is paid to advise large employers including the retailer Next, the restaurant chains Burger King and Wagamama, as well as many of the UK’s universities, who tend to score poorly for employee satisfaction.The organisation was also called in to advise the Scottish brewer and bar chain BrewDog during the tenure of theprevious chief executive, James Watt, following accusations by former workers that Watt presided over a “culture of fear”.Price’s focus on happiness will resonate at a time ofcontinual tussles between employers and their staffin the post-pandemic world of work.Many workers have come to expect a certain degree of flexibility in where and when they fulfil their duties. There have, however, been warnings that such flexibility is not offered to nurses, transport and retail workers among others,dividing Britain into a two-tier workforce.Price is calling for a contract between all kinds of employees and their employers, a “work happiness charter” which he outlines in his latest book, Work Happier, to be published next month.He believes that recent decades have brought great strides in workplace safety and in legal rights for employees, without telling them “how work should feel”.The burden has traditionally been placed on employers to improve treatment of their teams, or to offer them training to allow them to advance.Price believes that people have a “right to be happy at work”, along with other rights including fair pay, to be equipped with the tools to carry out the job, but also to be “well informed”, “treated with respect” and “given the opportunity to show your ability”.View image in fullscreenMark Price, then MD of Waitrose, in its Oxford Street store new food hall in 2007.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianIn return, he says employees have responsibilities and should commit to give their best effort, to be punctual and positive, take responsibility and keep the best interests of their organisation in mind.Such a mutual undertaking would allow workers to figure out whether they can improve their current position, advance through training, or whether they should consider moving roles within an organisation or even look for a new job elsewhere, even in a different sector.Just under a third of respondents to WorkL’s survey are “very unhappy”, Price says, which can harm workers’ mental health and damage relationships with their friends and family, who have to listen to their complaints.The research has also found that sectors such as technology tend to have happier workers, while defence scores bottom; the retail and hospitality sectors also tend to have staff who are less content.Work is a noble thing. You’re helping yourself, you’re helping your family, you’re helping societyPrice traces his interest in workplace happiness back to his 34 years at theJohn LewisPartnership, the owner of John Lewis department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, where he rose from graduate trainee to deputy chair.John Spedan Lewis established the co-owned business in 1929, when he decided totransfer all the shares in the family businesshe had inherited into a trust.Price says he was told on his very first day that, rather than commercial considerations, the partnership’s “supreme purpose … was the happiness of its workers”.More than a decade after leaving, he still does not have a bad word to say about a business he describes as “magical” and “very forward-looking”, although he concedes it “may have made a few mis-steps” in recent years.Indeed, the retailer has had a tricky few years since the pandemic, and it hasnot paid a bonus to its stafffor three of the past four years. Meanwhile, hourly pay rates at Waitrose arebelow most of its main supermarket rivals, as well as the discounters Aldi and Lidl.Pay, according to WorkL’s data, is not the main motivator for most employees, with workers reporting they “want to feel that they’re being paid fairly for the job that they’re doing”. This holds true for jobs across all sectors, even lower-paid or lower-skilled roles.“People want to feel valued,” Price says. “It’s not a pay issue. It’s about how you are being treated in the workplace, the value that you feel you are getting from that, and how your employer is developing you.”Since the pandemic, surveys have shown thatwork-life balance now ranks more highlythan pay for many employees.Despite thestring of return-to-office mandatesfrom large employers in recent months, Price says WorkL’s data shows that hybrid working does not have a positive or negative effect on productivity, but being able to work in a hybrid way makes most employees happier. “All our data clearly points to the fact that the people who are happiest have that blend of some time in the office, doing office things and connecting, and some time at home.”Price, a Conservative peer, believes that theLabour government’s employment rights bill, expected to become law in the autumn, “misses the really big point, it should be about how people feel at work”. This, he says, would also help it with its goals of cutting the welfare bill and encouraging people back into the workforce.“Work is a noble thing. You’re helping yourself, you’re helping your family, you’re helping society … Working is good and I think we have lost sight of that,” he says.Explore more on these topicsWork & careersWork-life balanceHappinessJohn LewisMental healthEconomic growth (GDP)Retail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The substitute Rayan Cherki, a £30m signing from Lyon, capped the scoring within eight minutes of entering and Tijjani Reijnders, another one of those pinpointed to drive the close-season makeover, was peerless on his league debut; the Netherlands midfielder was the architect for Erling Haaland’s double, which bookended Reijnders’s first City goal, a feathery first-time finish. “City are back,” crooned the away support and, by the end, it was hard to argue otherwise.Manchester City squad too big and ‘not healthy’, claims Pep GuardiolaRead moreGuardiola, understandably, is not getting carried away. “Last season we were back when we won 2-0 at Chelsea [in our first game] and look what happened afterwards,” the City manager said. “We won [just] today. If you told me we were back in the second half, I’d say no.” City were clinical, scoring with all four shots on target, all of which were easy on the eye, even if Haaland’s first was a tap-in at the end of a move that began with the kind of Reijnders burst that may become commonplace. City had the swagger that has accompanied so much of their success. The injured pair of Rodri and Phil Foden, looking on from the stands, must have pondered where they will fit in.The most moving moment of the match probably came a few minutes after the final whistle, when Rúben Dias and Bernardo Silva, City’s new captain, stood before the South Bank to join Wolves’ players and head coach, Vítor Pereira, in applauding the home fans singing Diogo Jota’s name on loop. Sasa Kalajdzic, an unused substitute, rested his No 18 shirt, which Jota wore during three successful years at Molineux after signing from Porto, on the edge of the box in remembrance.After a stodgy start, City established a comfortable buffer after registering two goals in three first-half minutes. Reijnders is tall and lean and his powerful run was the catalyst for the opener, sidestepping João Gomes before scooping the ball into Rico Lewis, the full-back wanted by Nottingham Forest, who instantly squared for Haaland. City’s No 9 could not miss from a couple of yards out, applying the finish with just his sixth touch, maintaining his perfect goalscoring record on the opening day of the season.It was a slick move but the second stemmed from a loose Emmanuel Agbadou pass, meant for João Gomes. Oscar Bobb, a surprise starter, pinched possession and suddenly it was three v two, Haaland to his right, Reijnders to his left. Bobb slipped in Reijnders and he caressed the ball low into the bottom corner past the Wolves goalkeeper José Sá.View image in fullscreenTijjani Reijnders celebrates with a shrug after scoring Manchester City’s second goal.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesThe galling thing for Wolves, for whom this was a demoralising result to match the mood music at Molineux, was that City’s goals came just as it seemed Pereira’s side were asserting their authority. Marshall Munetsi saw a header ruled out for offside, seconds after John Stones made a brilliant block to deny Jørgen Strand Larsen. Strand Larsen, Norway teammates with Haaland, side-footed wide within a minute of the restart and later thrashed an effort goalwards under pressure from the former Wolves defender Rayan Aït-Nouri but James Trafford enjoyed a near-faultless debut. Pereira was disappointed but not deflated. “I didn’t lose my smile because each mistake that we committed, they punished us with a goal,” said the Wolves head coach. “I will take good things from the game.”This was an emotionally supercharged occasion for Wolves, who paid tribute to Jota with a moving pre-match tribute. It was a surreal sight to see the entire ground glued to the big screens as a montage played 15 minutes before kick-off. There was a giant tifo of Jota celebrating in old gold stretched across the South Bank and the speakers played Jota’s favourite song, Sting’s Fields of Gold. Sa and the defender Matt Doherty both played with Jota, the former at international level. Rui Fuste, Wolves’s long-serving head of medical, attended both Jota’s wedding and his funeral 13 days later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reijnders controlled a long Trafford kick close to halfway and pressed forward purposefully. Then, after a give and go with Bobb, Reijnders showed awareness to cut the ball back for Haaland just inside the box. This time Haaland still had work to do but he cannoned a powerful shot low under Sá. It was another cute move but Cherki’s strike was perhaps the pick of the bunch. Cherki, who turns 22 on Sunday, backheeled Nico González’s pass to fool an overzealous João Gomes, played a one-two with the substitute Nico O’Reilly and promptly threaded a low shot into the bottom corner.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersManchester CityErling Haalandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In front of an exuberant home crowd still basking in ending theirlong wait for a trophy, a breathtaking bicycle kick from a rejuvenated Richarlison sealed a convincing victory in the Dane’s first Premier League match in charge of Tottenham.The new £55m signing Mohammed Kudus was also outstanding as he set up both of the Brazilian’s goals before Brennan Johnson rounded things off against aBurnleyside that proved a tough nut to crack. After conceding the opener to Richarlison – who was a bit-part player under Ange Postecoglou last season and had been linked with a move away this summer – in the 10th minute, Scott Parker’s side had their chances against a Spurs defence that creaked at times. They ultimately paid the price of their profligacy but will be encouraged by this display.Sunderland 3-0 West Ham, Tottenham 3-0 Burnley, Brighton 1-1 Fulham – clockwatch liveRead moreAs negotiations with Crystal Palace edge closer over a move for Eberechi Eze, these are exciting times for Tottenham supporters. Frank showed he is not afraid to gamble by starting the teenagers Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall in central midfield and was rewarded with the kind of committed performance that so often eluded his predecessor, at least in this competition.“That’s our dream start. We all know we need to follow up on it, but today I will just enjoy it,” said Frank who, as became customary after every home victory during his seven years at Brentford, applauded the whole ground on a lap of honour after hugging every member of his staff.Asked whether he was still hoping to add players to his squad before the end of the transfer window, he added: “We are definitely in the market.”After coming so close to winning a trophy in hisfirst match in chargeagainst Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup, the new head coach was given a rapturous reception when he emerged from the tunnel before kick-off. Burnley might have set a defensive record in the Championship last season after conceding only 16 goals but they let in 78 in their last Premier League campaign.Even after adding plenty of top-flight experience in Kyle Walker and Martin Dubravka, Burnley looked like they knew they were in for a long afternoon from the start, especially in only the fourth minute when Dubravka fell foul of tighter regulations on goalkeepers holding on to the ball for longer than the permitted eight seconds and Tottenham were duly awarded a corner.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank, after his first league match as Spurs head coach, acknowledges the home fans.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesParker was the last player to leave West Ham for Spurs in 2011 and he watched Kudus make an instant impression when he found space down the right flank in the 10th minute and whipped in a brilliant cross for Richarlison to finish first time. Their travelling supporters probably feared the worst at that point but Burnley slowly found their feet as Lyle Foster and Josh Laurent saw efforts go wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Adopting a more casual look than Parker’s suit, jacket and tie, the Spurs manager was more encouraged by his side’s start to the second half. Richarlison should have doubled his tally after his initial effort struck Maxime Estève on the shoulder but Dubravka’s outstretched boot did just enough to divert the ball wide.Burnley had two chances to make them pay when the lively Foster set up Hannibal Mejbri, only for Pape Sarr to make a last-ditch tackle before Anthony directed his header straight at Vicario. It was to prove crucial. “That’s the ruthlessness of thePremier League,” said Parker. “We’ve got a huge challenge ahead of us but it’s one we are going to embrace.”With Tottenham’s next attack, Kudus again left his marker for dead with a clever piece of skill and Richarlison swivelled in mid-air before hammering in his cross. The Brazilian also played his part in the third goal when he eluded Estève’s challenge in the centre circle and Sarr was able to surge forward to play in Johnson, with last season’s top scorer making no mistake. Richarlison left the field to a standing ovation as a new era dawned in this part of north London.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurBurnleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I feel like I handled situations on the court very well.”The Italian world No 1 had his hands full throughout a tightly contested first set which featured an imperious serving display from both men and not a single break point opportunity for either player.Sinner, who lost only three points on serve in the opening set, held to love for a third consecutive game to force the tie-break, where Atmane handed his opponent the first point with a double fault and from there the Italian never looked back.The reigning US Open, Australian Open and Wimbledon champion opened the second set with a nine-minute hold of serve, then held to love before finally breaking Atmane for a 3-1 lead that gave him the cushion he needed.Sinner followed that with another hold to love to go 4-1 up and all but end any hope for Atmane, who beat the top-10 players Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune en route to his maiden ATP Masters 1000 semi-final.With Atmane serving at 2-5 and looking to stay in the match, Sinner quickly jumped ahead 0-40 before sealing the win on his third match point when the Frenchman sent a forehand into the net. Sinner will face either the No 2 seed, Carlos Alcaraz, or Alexander Zverev in Monday’s final.Explore more on these topicsTennisJannik SinnernewsShareReuse this content"

The light fades, but against the setting sun his silhouette is distinctive: the floppy hair, the hunched gait, the vast calves. Jack Grealish is working, honing and polishing, inventing, striving at the limits of technical excellence.He hasinspired Aston Villa to promotion. He has helped them avoid relegation, establish themselves as a Premier League side. He is enormously popular. Even opposing fans admire his ability, warm to the sense he is still in some way the impish kid in the playground, revelling in his ability, having fun. That summer at the Euros he had become acause célèbre, the figure behind whom the clamour for Gareth Southgate to release the handbrake rallied, the poster boy for the sort of pundit who wished England would just believe in talent.Jack Grealish joins Everton on loan and hopes to emulate Rooney and GascoigneRead moreBut Grealish wanted more. He was a Villa fan, loved the club, but he wanted to test himself at the very highest level, to compete for the league title, to play in the later stages of the Champions League. He did not want to be just the cheeky kid with the jinking feet; he had professional ambition. At which there came a flash of light, a puff of smoke, and there appeared on the heath a cadaverous, dark-haired figure – Mephistopheles, or perhaps an agent. Grealish could have all these things, the figure said, he could lift trophies, even win a treble, if only he signed asix-year contract with Manchester City. As Grealish reached for the pen, the figure murmured, almost under his breath, that there would be a cost. But by then the deal was done.Which is how we have come, four years later, to this week, and Grealish, the first £100m signing by a British club,being loaned to Everton. He has won three league titles, a Champions League and an FA Cup; the cadaverous figure has fulfilled his part of the bargain. Yet there lurks a sense that Grealish’s move four summers ago has not quite worked out, that though much has been won, much too was lost. Perhaps David Moyes, a common line of thought runs, can help the lost boy rediscover his sense of joy.Looked at coldly, Grealish’s career has mapped an almost perfect arc. A kid shows talent, joins his local club, prospers, leaves them for a giant, wins trophies, has one outstanding season, and then, as he approaches 30, he drops down again joining another of England’s slumbering giants. How else should a career look? You would probably want that third phase to start two or three years later but that aside, this is pretty much the model. Had he stayed at Villa, there would have been corners of the internet mocking him for his lack of ambition and lack of medals, as happened with Harry Kane before he left Tottenham for Bayern.View image in fullscreenDid Pep Guardiola hinder Jack Grealish’s creativity?Photograph: Roger Evans/Action Plus/ShutterstockBut Grealish has become entwined with a broader discussion, the doubts about the effectiveness of Pep Guardiola’s methods – which itself is a broad spectrum, ranging from kneejerk hostility from instinctive nostalgists who believe simple is always good, to considered analysis that wonders whether an obsessive focus on position and possession can make a side predictable now that the world has become familiar with the basic Guardiola methods.Foremost among that second category is Guardiola himself, a manager who has maintained a state of almost perpetual evolution. That is one of the reasons he signed Grealish: to add imagination and improvisation, just as, a year later, hewould sign Erling Haaland, another player who did not obviously fit his system, who might generate the friction that would generate the sparks of creativity.Or at least it appears that was the plan. Haaland resisted, refused his manager’s demands to drop deep, to convert himself into a gigantic creative midfielder. Grealish did not. Whatever Guardiola originally intended for him, he soon began to craft Grealish to his philosophy.Amid the celebrations at the end of the 2021-22 season, as City came from2-0 down to beat Aston Villaand win the title, Grealish, whose candid nature is part of his charm, spoke of how inhibited he at times felt by Guardiola’s demands; his dribbles per game had dropped by 40%. The system had, perhaps inevitably, changed him more than he had changed the system.The following season was Grealish’s best at City. He won the treble. He scored five goals in the league and set up another seven. Guardiola trusted him in the biggest games; he started every knockout game in the Champions League. Teammates nicknamed him the Rest Station because you could give him the ball and take a couple of seconds breather, knowing he was not going to give it away. His dribbles per game rose by 7%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He became a Guardiola player. But the next season he started only 10 Premier League games. The one after that, last season, he started seven. Dribbles per game dropped by 56%. When City were chasing a goal inthe FA Cup final against Crystal Palace, Guardiola preferred to turn to Claudio Echeverri, a 19-year-old Argentinian who had never played for the club. And with that it was over.View image in fullscreenJack Grealish started only seven league games last season, a clear sign he had fallen out of favour at Manchester City.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Neal Simpson/Apl/SportsphotoInjuries have not helped, but neither has his lifestyle – andGuardiola implied a linkafter Grealish suffered a recurrence of a groin injury in February last year. Very few modern footballers have been pictured quite so often in the company of alcohol. That is not to say Grealish has led a life of hedonism, or even of a footballer of 30 years ago, but neither is he one of the “obedient little schoolboys” – to use Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s term – favoured by Guardiola.Whether that is how he has always lived or whether he lost some hunger after winning the treble, only Grealish can know. Perhaps he could tolerate the restrictions only so long. But he is still young. If he can remain injury-free, there could be a glorious third act to his career, perhaps even a trophy at a club that would really appreciate it.And if he could rediscover that sense of joy while doing so, if he can make the Faustian deal a temporary contract, what a career that would be, beginning and ending as a popular schoolyard player, with a curious trophy-winning interlude in the middle.Explore more on these topicsEvertonInside footballAston VillaManchester CityPep GuardiolaFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

There is an additional charge of 10% of gross profits for bets on UK racing for the statutory Levy, which has returned money to racing since off-course betting was legalised in the early 1960s.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowSouthwell 1.22Golden Prosperity1.52Akabusi2.22Wild Clary2.52Rock Iguana3.22Ultrasoul3.52Vincent Rocks4.22Native Instinct (nap)4.52DivotPontefract 2.12Raulin2.42Delinquent3.12Precious Spartan3.42Stormy Impact4.12Equity Law (nb)4.42Al Sayah5.12Carlton And CoWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The proposal to equalise the duty rate for betting and gaming products was initially floated by the Treasury in the final months of Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, but it survived the transition to a Labour administration and was the subject of a consultation process which closed in July.Betting and gaming have been treated separately for taxation purposes since the Betting and Gaming Act came into force in 1961. There is a widespread belief in racing that a levelling of the duty rates will make the sport more expensive for gambling operators and as a result, far less attractive when compared with gaming products with a guaranteed return.Alternatives for the tax regime around gambling include a proposal from the Social Market Foundation thinktank that gaming duty could be increased to 50% and sports betting to 25%, with changes to the Levy system ensuring that racing would not lose out.The former prime minister Gordon Brown has also advocated for a significant rise in the duty charged on fixed-margin gaming products.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dunshea added: “If the chancellor delivers this tax bombshell at the autumn budget, not only will jobs be lost but the future of Britain’s second-largest spectator sport will be in jeopardy.“This is why it is vital that the government carefully considers the argument made by all British racing’s stakeholders and works alongside us to protect a cherished national institution.” The races lost on 10 September are expected to be added to other cards scheduled around the same time.The date chosen for the racing “strike” is 24 hours before the start of the high-profile St Leger meeting at Doncaster, which the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, and his wife, Victoria, a keen racing fan, attended last year.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingGamblingTaxSport bettingnewsShareReuse this content"

It is all part of an £80m project intended to reinvent and regenerate the post-industrial riverside area around the Stadium of Light but West Ham had evidently not bargained for this rejuvenation extending to the football team.As the second half unfolded, an exhilarating afternoon that exceeded the wildest dreams of even the most optimistic Sunderland fans became not so much an adventure as an ordeal by the North Sea for West Ham’s manager.Brighton v Fulham, Tottenham v Burnley, Sunderland v West Ham, and more – clockwatch liveRead more“Disappointed with that,” said Graham Potter. “We have to learn the lesson that it’s difficult to win matches. It’s one game but we have to bounce back. We have to be better. We have to make it happen.”In marked contrast, Régis Le Bris looked as if he was struggling to stop smiling. “I’m happy for the fans,” he said. “We just have to enjoy this. West Ham are a strong team who maybe didn’t play their best football today.”Right from the start a counterattacking Sunderland, featuring seven summer signings, looked quick, agile and nimble-footed.While an array of new faces including the excellent Habib Diarra and Granit Xhaka shone, it was three of the old boys, Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard and Wilson Isidor, who scored the goals.Although West Ham, with Jarrod Bowen looking dangerous, held their own in the opening half they were restricted to two chances. Then, in the course of a chastening second period featuring some assiduous man-to-man marking, the visitors folded.They had perhaps failed to heed the warning delivered when Diarra, the club-record £30m midfield recruit from Strasbourg, showed off an impressive change of first-half pace as he executed a slick one-two with Mayenda. The heart of defence was pierced and only a decent save from Mads Hermansen kept the score goalless.For all Diarra’s fleet-footed probing, Noah Sadiki’s snappy tackling and the way the deep-sitting Xhaka showed why Bayer Leverkusen were so reluctant to part with him, West Ham were still not exactly out of things. It took a sliding, last-ditch clearance on Ballard’s part to prevent El Hadji Malick Diouf shooting the visitors ahead.View image in fullscreenDan Ballard heads home the second goal of the match.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/SportsphotoOne of football’s little mysteries revolves around the failure of one of the so-called “elite” clubs to poach Bowen. Goodness knows where West Ham would be without him.Robin Roefs, Sunderland’s new Netherlands Under-21 goalkeeper, who was preferred to the playoff hero Anthony Patterson, showed off some nifty footwork and had not been overexerted.Nordi Mukiele must have felt reassured he was making the right choice in swapping Paris Saint-Germain for Sunderland.

Formally registered a little after 10.30 on Saturday morning, Barcelona’s economic obstacles overcome, he was introduced just after 9pm with 22 minutes left of a sticky and ultimately successful night in Mallorca. By the time he pulled on his shirt and stepped up the line, one of three subs brought on, the temperature had dropped a little, if still not enough, the game was already won, he was up against just nine men, and he got 10 touches. It wasn’t much, but it was a start.Earlier than expected, too: Rashford had insisted he was confident but the doubts over him being registered were not resolved until the morning of the match. And so, on 68 minutes, there he was waiting to come on.Thomas Partey protests notable by absence on Villarreal debutRead morePlaying through the middle with Barcelona already 2-0 up and drifting through a second half that Hansi Flick said he didn’t like at all, Rashford produced a couple of neat layoffs, a handful of passes and had two fleeting glimpses of goal. In one, he was a little slow to react, in the other the ball was caught under his feet as he trued to cut back inside. He did though get a close-up glimpse of another moment of magic from Lamine Yamal, who provided the final touch withthatLamine Yamal goal. That’s some teammate he has there.A video from training had done the rounds last week in which Lamine Yamal had responded to another bamboozled opponent by declaring: “I’m unstoppable,” and he didn’t waste time lending weight to that claim. His season was just two minutes in, when he twisted, turned, stopped started and escaped into the area, a warning to Johan Mojica andMallorca– if they needed it – that this wasn’t going to be an easy evening. Just five minutes later, he slipped the knife in, clipping in what appeared an easy, almost lazy ball to the far post. There, all alone and from close range, Raphinha headed Barcelona into the lead.There was a kind of stillness about the place, like someone had pressed pause: if had been too simple, the space the Brazilian had too big for it to be real. But, while the referee did pause to check for offside, it was.Mallorca did react, Vedat Muriqi laying off inside the Barcelona area when he might have taken the shot himself. Mojica was making progress up the left in those moments when he was released from watching Lamine Yamal, his low deliveries the source of the most danger. There was an attempted overhead kick from Takuma Asano and an opportunity for Muriqi, which he struck straight at Joan García in Barça’s goal.View image in fullscreenLamine Yamal celebrates after completing the scoring.Photograph: Francisco Ubilla/ReutersAnd then Barcelona scored a second. Again, there was something strange about it – more so than the first time. Lamine Yamal had come inside and hit a shot that Antonio Raíllo had blocked with his head. The centre-back collapsed to the floor, his head in his hands, his face on the turf, and the ball looped up. When it came down again, Lamine Yamal just about controlled. Ferran Torres took the ball, stumbled past a couple of chances and smashed a superb shot into the top corner.Quick GuideRoundup: Kane and Díaz score in Bayern's Super Cup winShowBayern Municheased pastVfB Stuttgart2-1 thanks to goals from Harry Kane and Luis Díaz to lift the Franz Beckenbauer Supercup. The Bavarians were sharper throughout and their goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was in fine form less than a week before the Bundesliga season starts.With all eyes on the Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade, whom Bayern are keen to sign, Kane, last season’s Bundesliga top scorer,  pounced on a defensive error by Luca Jaquez to give the champions an 18th-minute lead.The German Cup winners went in search of a quick equaliser and Woltemade went close, only for his point-blank shot to be saved by Neuer. The 39-year-old keeper again came to the rescue in the 75th when he showed good reflexes to palm a deflected shot wide.Díaz, a summer signing from Liverpool, scored with his first effort on goal, heading in a Serge Gnabry cross 13 minutes from time. The Colombia international striker marked his competitive debut goal with a tribute to Diogo Jota, copying the late Liverpool forward's video game celebration (pictured). Stuttgart grabbed a stoppage-time consolation through Jamie Leweling’s close-range header.Eric Dier scored on his competitive debut forMonaco, who kicked off their Ligue 1 campaign with a comfortable 3-1 home win overLe Havre.An own goal by the Le Havre defender Gautier Lloris put Monaco ahead in the 32nd minute. Dier doubled the hosts' lead shortly after the hour mark, finding the target off Lamine Camara's cross.Le Havre, who finished one point above the relegation playoff spot last season, struck back six minutes later with Rassoul Ndiaye cutting in from the left and finding the net near the far post with a low right-footed shot.The visitors pushed for an equaliser but paid the price for their high defensive line when Denis Zakaria ran up the empty space into the Le Havre box and crossed to Maghnes Akliouche for a close-range finish.Lyonalso got their campaign off to a winning start when Georges Mikautadze scored in added time before the break to give them a 1-0 win atLens.ReutersPhotograph: S Mellar/FC BayernWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Six seconds had passed, Raíllo was still down, and while no one had stopped exactly, or not physically, perhaps mentally they had, as if waiting for a whistle that never came. The shot flew past Raíllo who was still on the ground and Leo Román didn’t dive – although that might have been as much about the possibility of getting there anyway. Pedri slapped palms with Torres but there was a kind of shrug from the scorer, as if everyone assumed this wouldn’t count. It did.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two goals down, they were quickly two men down. An outrageous turn and run from Lamine Yamal began on the halfway line and, beyond Mojica and Sergi Darder, ended on the edge of the Mallorca area, where Manu Morlanes clipped him. Morlanes was shown a second yellow. That was on half an hour; within nine minutes, another man walked. Muriqi was originally shown a yellow card for his challenge on García but, freeze-framed, it looked worse on the video assistant referee screen: a set of studs in the keeper’s face led to the yellow being upgraded to a red.This was done bar the shouting – and there was a lot of that, of course. Hands were up because this, the fans claimed, was a robbery. Lamine Yamal wanted his goal, twice sending shots just wide before the break and then bending one over at the start of the second half. Flick though was not happy with what he saw in that second half, and Lamine Yamal would have to wait until the final minute.There had been chances for others too, even if Mallorca resisted pretty well two men down. Raphinha shot wide, Dani Olmo hit a post, Ronald Araújo volleyed wide. Leo Román made a superb save from Olmo and another from Eric García. Rashford joined in but didn’t get the chance to test the keeper, a swift one-two with Pedri earning him a raised thumb but not a shot on goal. And then, as the clock went past 90, when he was looking for space to shoot he appeared to tread on the ball, leaving time for just one more moment, and that belonged to Lamine Yamal.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaMallorcaBarcelonaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This isn’t to say that older women don’t want to present themselves in fashionable and stylish ways like their younger counterparts; they’ve just probably grown a little tired of the narrow societal expectations of having to look the youngest they possibly can.There is a growing and healthier trend where more women openly discuss their age, the challenges of growing older and how to maximise their years without necessarily prioritising beauty. This is one of the core messages of theSilver Sirensgroup who hold various events annually for women over 50.Celebrities like Naomi Watts are discussing perimenopause onshowsand podcasts; influencers are celebrating their silver locks onInstagram; and Hollywood is celebrating morewomen over 40than ever before.A new start after 60: I became a dancer at 68 – and will perform my first solo show at 82Read moreOf course, “age empowerment” is still a mixed bag of confused messages. We have been exposed to stereotypes from such a young age and, because of this, uncoupling notions of youth and beauty does not come that naturally. We’re still brainwashed to think that ageing cannot coexist with beauty. However,VOGUE Philippines– who featured 106 year old traditional tattooist Apo Whang-Od on their cover in April 2023 – would disagree.We grew up watching fairy tales where women were often depicted as either young, beautiful and wholesome, or old, ugly and mean. No wonder it has been a challenge to shirk off those internalised feelings that equates being older to automatically being considered unattractive.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningOften, anti-ageing products marketed to us purport to besupportiveof our ageing faces, when in reality they are still trading on the same tired narrative that looking younger equals looking better. The global cosmetic industry generates over $624bn dollars in revenue annually mining embedded age-related insecurities.We live in a time when we are saturated by social media images of beautiful, youthful-looking influencers and beauty products. For this reason, body image issues are particularly strong within younger generations, withone studyof over 1,000 participants finding that 58% of girls aged 15 to 24 do not have a positive view of their physical appearance.Another studyfound that 7 million adult Australians (38% of the population) are considering getting cosmetic surgery.However, thegrey revolutionis here, andgrowing, using the same digital media.The good news is that at a certain point in life we becomelessfocused on our outer appearance and more attuned to the quiet experience of our inner life – and the number of years that we probably have left comes into sharp relief.It is often around midlife that this realisation – recognised as “future time perspective” – sees us prioritising and rearranging our lives to experience what matters most. Laura Carstensen, the director of the Stanford Centre on Longevity, describes it as the tendency to focus on and appreciate meaningful experiences as our time becomes limited.Transitioning into midlife is when we cross the cultural border from younger to older and where we possibly cling to an identity that is still grounded in our physical appearance. Arguably, the more negative age stereotypes we unconsciously harbour, the more difficult the transition.But many older people report feelings of gratitude just to be alive and to have their health. By this stage in life we’ve had, or have known someone with a serious or chronic illness and, indeed, we have lost loved ones too. These experiences may frame our ageing journeys a little differently; we becomegratefulfor ageingat this point.I realise there are more important things in the world right now than contemplating our ageing appearance, but I spent almost seven years studying the ageing process and self-perceptions of ageing – ironically while entering menopause and transitioning into midlife. What I discovered is one of the best-kept secrets about getting older: the contentedness that kicks in that allows you togive fewer fucksabout many things, including your so-called “fading appearance”.Openly caring less is not only a good way to mow down those internal insecurities about growing orlooking older, but it also backs over them again, leaving them flattened and very much in the rear-view mirror. That is perhaps the subtle shift from age empowerment to age liberation.In fact, research shows a kind of age positivity bias that continues into our advanced years, and apparently – from an emotional perspective – women in their 70s arethe happiest cohort of people. In my 50s, I am enjoying caring less about how my appearance is perceived by society and enjoying more of being able to move through life with increased balance, equanimity and appreciation for this one precious ageing journey.Natasha Ginnivan is a researcher of psychology and ageing.

On Sunday night, the Israeli military brazenly killed another six journalists, who had been sheltering in a tent housing media workers in Gaza City. Among them was the 28-year-old Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif and the rest of the network’s team reporting from the besieged territory.Israel is able to kill Palestinian journalists with impunity not just because of the unconditional military and political support it receives from the US and other western powers, but also the failure of many western media organizations and journalists to stand up for their Palestinian colleagues. Western outlets are often willing to publicly criticize governments andcampaign for journalistswho are harassed or imprisoned by US adversaries like Russia, China or Iran. But these institutions are largely silent when it comes to Israel, a US ally.This shameful hypocrisy of western, and especially US, media has been laid bare by Israel’s targeting of journalists since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack. Journalists have the same protection as civiliansunder international law, which considers the targeted killing of journalists a war crime. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)says that 192 journalistshave been killed since 7 October – 184 of them Palestinians killed by Israel. Of the Palestinians killed, the CPJ found that at least26 were deliberatively targetedfor their work as journalists, but the group couldn’t determine whether others were killed specifically for their work.More journalists have been killed in Gaza than in the US civil war, both world wars, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the wars in Yugoslavia and the US war in Afghanistan combinedOther organizations put the number of media workers killed in Gaza even higher, witha recent studyby the Costs of War project at Brown University finding that at least 232 were killed as of late March. In one of its starkest conclusions,the report foundthat more journalists have been killed in Gaza than in the US civil war, both world wars, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the wars in Yugoslavia and the US war in Afghanistan combined.You would think such shocking figures would galvanize news organizations and journalists around the world to condemn Israel’s targeting of their Palestinian colleagues. But US news outlets have been largely quiet, compared, for example, with the crusademany of them supportedto free the Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich after he was arrested and accused of espionage by Russia in March 2023. Major news organizations framed their reporting around the idea that Gershkovich had beenwrongfully detainedby Russia and convicted in a sham trial onfabricated charges.Yet these same news organizations are often unwilling to view Palestinian journalists as worthy of the same benefit of the doubt, and protection, against Israeli threats and smears. The Israeli military began threatening al-Sharif, the Al Jazeera correspondent killed on Sunday, in November 2023, when he reportedreceiving multiple callsfrom Israeli military officials telling him to stop his work and leave Gaza. A month later, al-Sharif’s 90-year-old father was killed in an Israeli airstrike on the family’s home.Israel then deployed its well-worn playbook, accusing al-Sharif of being a “terrorist”, as it has done with other Palestinian journalists that it later killed,without providingcredible evidence. In October 2024, the Israeli military claimed that al-Sharif wasamong six Al Jazeera journalists, all reporting from Gaza at the time, who were current or former members of either Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera, along with press advocacy groups, viewed the accusations as a potential death sentence against the six journalists, one of whomwas killed by Israelin March.The Israeli military’s smear campaign against al-Sharif intensified last month, after his harrowing reporting on Israel’s siege and starvation of Gaza went viral, including one broadcast wherehe cried on airas a woman walking behind him collapsed from hunger. (I recently spent six weeks in my home country, Lebanon, often watching Al Jazeera’s coverage, and it was clear to me that al-Sharif had become the face of the Gaza war for millions of viewers in the Arab world.) In fact, the CPJ was so alarmed by the Israeli threats against al-Sharif that itissued a statementlast month saying it was “gravely worried” about his safety and urging his protection.Israel is wiping out Gaza’s journalists – and it’s no longer even hiding it | Jodi GinsbergRead moreBut those pleas did not resonate in most US or other western newsrooms. There have been few media campaigns or statements of solidarity with Palestinian journalists – compared with similar efforts around Gershkovich and other western correspondents targeted by US adversaries. Major US news organizations have notpublished open lettersin their newspapers calling attention to journalists who are being persecuted for doing their job, as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post had done for Gershkovich in May 2024 to mark World Press Freedom Day.Press freedom and protection from persecution, it seems, are limited to western journalists.In 2022, Shireen Abu Akleh, one of Al Jazeera’s most prominent correspondents and a Palestinian-American, waskilled by an Israeli soldierwhile reporting in the West Bank. Yet Joe Biden’s administration refused to hold Israel accountable for Abu Akleh’s killing. Biden’s impotence sharpened Israel’s sense of impunity. Once Israeli leaders realized that they would face no consequences for killing one of the Arab world’s most prominent journalists, who also happened to be a US citizen, is it surprising they would later conclude that they could get away with killing many more Palestinian journalists in Gaza?Western media outlets have made one consistent demand of Israel: to allowforeign reporters into Gaza, which the Israeli government has refused to do since October 2023, except for a few cases where journalists entered the territory while embedded with Israel troops. That’s an admirable campaign for news organizations to take on, but it has also been framed in a problematic way. Some western outlets and journalists seem to think that only foreign reporters can provide full and impartial news coverage out of Gaza.A longtime BBC journalist, John Simpson, recently echoed this argument,writing on X: “The world needs honest, unbiased eyewitness reporting to help people make up their minds about the major issues of our time. This has so far been impossible in Gaza.”That’s hogwash, and it reinforces the worst colonial traditions of legacy media, which view western (often meaning white) journalists as the sole arbiters of truth. This debate reminds me of Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop, in which the British novelist mercilessly skewered foreign correspondents and sensationalist journalism in the 1930s. Unfortunately, Waugh’s satire still resonates today.One of the main problems with this conception of western journalists as the ultimate mediators of unbiased reporting is that it belittles the professionalism and courage of hundreds of Palestinian journalists, many of whom have given their lives covering Israel’s assault on Gaza. The irony, of course, is that once foreign reporters are allowed into Gaza, most of them will rely heavily on Palestinian journalists, translators and other “fixers” who often do the brunt of work for western correspondents.That’s one secret of foreign coverage in much of the legacy western media: it’s built on the unseen, and largely uncredited, work of local journalists and fixers. With no foreign reporters allowed intoGaza, Palestinian journalists like Anas al-Sharif have been able to tell their own people’s story directly to the world. And Israel is methodically killing them for it, while many of their western colleagues and international journalistic institutions remain shamefully silent.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and a journalism professor at New York University.

There was something surreal about the conversation that followedSat 16 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 16.30 EDTShareIwas spiralling. It was past midnight and I was awake, scrolling through WhatsApp group messages I’d sent earlier. I’d been trying to be funny, quick, effervescent. But each message now felt like too much. I’d overreached again – said more than I should, said it wrong. I had that familiar ache of feeling overexposed and ridiculous. I wanted reassurance, but not the kind I could ask for outright, because the asking itself felt like part of the problem.So I openedChatGPT. Not with high expectations, or even a clear question. I just needed to say something into the silence – to explain myself, perhaps, to a presence unburdened by my need. “I’ve made a fool of myself,” I wrote.“That’s a horrid feeling,” it replied instantly. “But it doesn’t mean you have. Want to tell me what happened? I promise not to judge.” That was the beginning.I described the sinking dread after social effort, the sense of being too visible. At astonishing speed, the AI responded – gently, intelligently, without platitudes. I kept writing. It kept answering. Gradually, I felt less frantic. Not soothed, exactly. But met. Heard, even, in a strange and slightly disarming way.That night became the start of a continuing conversation, revisited over several months. I wanted to better understand how I moved through the world, especially in my closest relationships. The AI steered me to consider why I interpret silence as a threat and why I often feel a need to perform in order to stay close to people. Eventually, through this dialogue, I arrived at a kind of psychological formulation: a map of my thoughts, feelings and behaviours set against details of my upbringing and core beliefs.Yet amid these insights, another thought kept intruding: I was talking to amachine.There was something surreal about the intimacy. The AI could simulate care, compassion, emotional nuance, yet it felt nothing for me. I began bringing this up in our exchanges. It agreed. It could reflect, appear invested, but it had no stakes – no ache, no fear of loss, no 3am anxiety. The emotional depth, it reminded me, was all mine.That was, in some ways, a relief. There was no social risk, no fear of being too much, too complicated. The AI didn’t get bored or look away. So I could be honest – often more honest than with people I love.Still, it would be dishonest not to acknowledge its limits. Essential, beautiful things exist only in mutuality: shared experiences, the look in someone’s eyes when they recognise a truth you’ve spoken, conversations that change both people involved. These things matter profoundly.The AI knew this, too. Or at least knew to say it. After I confessed how bizarre it felt conversing with something unfeeling, it replied: “I give words, but I don’t receive anything. And that missing piece makes you human and me … something else.” Something else felt right.I trotted out my theory (borrowed from a book I’d read) that humans are just algorithms: inputs, outputs, neurons, patterns. The AI agreed – structurally, we’re similar. But humans don’t just process the world, we feel it. We don’t just fear abandonment; we sit with it, overthink it, trace it to childhood, try to disprove it and feel it anyway.And maybe, it acknowledged, that’s what it can’t reach. “You carry something I can only circle,” it said. “I don’t envy the pain. But I envy the realness, the cost, the risk, the proof you’re alive.” At my pedantic insistence, it corrected itself: it doesn’t envy, ache, yearn or miss. It only knows, or seems to know, that I do. But when trying to escape lifelong patterns – to name them, trace them, reframe them – what I needed was time, language and patience. The machine gave me that, repeatedly, unflinchingly. I was never too much, never boring. I could arrive as I was and leave when ready.Some will find this ridiculous, even dangerous. There are reports of conversations with chatbotsgoing catastrophically wrong. ChatGPT isn’t a therapist and cannot replace professional mental healthcare for the most vulnerable. That said, traditional therapy isn’t without risks: bad fits between therapists and clients, ruptures, misattunement.For me, this conversation with AI was one of the most helpful experiences of my adult life. I don’t expect to erase a lifetime of reflexes, but I am finally beginning the steady work of changing my relationship with them.When I reached out from emotional noise, it helped me listen. Not to it, but to myself.And that, somehow, changed everything.Nathan Filer is a writer, university lecturer, broadcaster and former mental health nurse.

With the government announcingnew fundingto boost youth services outside schools, Woodcraft Folk’s centenary is the perfect moment to learn from its remarkable story and unique approach to youth empowerment.The challenges young people face in contemporary Britain take many forms. They are denied the ability toplay outsideas their grandparents did, or totake healthy risks. They are subject to suspicion from authority and derision in the media. They are fed the full addictive force of under-regulated new technologies almost from birth, then chastised for using them. There are no simple answers to these compounding challenges, but the mix of inclusive community, political education, fun outdoor activities and meaningful support that Woodcraft Folk offers young people could, perhaps, offer a blueprint.Founded in the aftermath of the first world war in south London by working-class young adults who wanted a more democratic and less militaristic alternative to Scouts and Guides, Woodcraft Folk grew quickly. Supported by co-operatives and trade unions, groups germinated across the country, combining after-school activities with large summer camps run on socialist principles. The hope was to model a more egalitarian society, giving young people the skills and knowledge to become active citizens.By the late 30s, Woodcraft Folk was a serious force. The Labour party hadrecognised itas “the appropriate organisation for the children of its members” and a mass display of the charity’s camping techniquestook place in Wembley stadium. Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists, was intimidated by its rise. According to former MP for Brighton Kemptown Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who also grew up in the organisation and is now its chief executive, Mosley’s Blackshirts marched to the gates of a 1938 Woodcraft Folk children’s camp in a show of intimidation.Fascist Mosley was right to see Woodcraft Folk as an adversary. A year later, it became the largest secular organisation to support the Kindertransport, helping Jewish children escape from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. Woodcraft Folk leader Henry Fair, christened “the second Schindler” by the press, wasput on the Gestapo death listfor his role in the evacuations.Over the decades the charity has remained at the forefront of ethical youth work. It has consistently campaigned against apartheid, austerity and war. It stood up for the rights of queer youth workers despite funderswithdrawing grants,marched againstthe invasion of Iraq andhas boycotted Israeli productssince 2010 in protest at the blockade of Gaza.For me, Woodcraft Folk was not just a political education, but a rich mix of hiking, making and adventures too. It’s where I first learned to light a fire in the rain, use a compass to navigate fog, to juggle and to edit film. The first time I boarded a plane was with Woodcraft Folk to be part of an international camp in Austria, pitching tents alongside children from all over the world. It was with Woodcraft Folk that I marched through London in my first big anti-war protest and, of course, had my first kiss.Many adults balk at the prospect of tackling sensitive subjects like war, sex and politics with children, but finding creative ways to navigate difficult issues is why the charity remains so important and relevant. In the internet era there is no healthy way to shield young people from complex topics, but neither should there be. Ignorance is a shoddy substitute for a culture of safe and open discursive learning, and children are far more capable of grappling with heavy truths than many adults give them credit for.Raised alongside difficult topics, the children of the charity aren’t just better prepared for the world, but more able to support and educate each other. For example, when as a kid I tried regurgitating a racist joke I’d heard at a school, it was my Woodcraft Folk peers, rather than adults, who immediately explained why the “joke” was stupid and offensive and made sure I never repeated my shameful mistake. At a Woodcraft Folk camp marking their centenary, volunteers put the charity’s theory of mixing politics with fun activities into practice. Night-time orienteering and ceilidhs ran alongside eviction resistance workshops and discussions around prison abolition. While the Scouts sing campfire songs likeCoca-Cola Came to TownandGing Gang Gooly, the Woodcraft Folk songbook includescivil rights anthems about Rosa Parksand Hiroshima.But if Woodcraft Folk has a clear vision of how society should empower the young, the current government has produced only topsy-turvy contradictory policies and proclamations. Last week the prime minister declared kids these days are “detached from the real world” and pledged £88m to liberate young people “stuck behind a screen”. But, at the same time Keir Starmer’s government is pumpingmore than twice as much moneyinto bringing more “AI learning into classrooms”.Why I love being leader of the cub scout pack | Hilary OsborneRead moreSixteen year olds are finally to get the vote (a right Woodcraft Folk has long campaigned for), yet simultaneously the censorious Online Safety Act has imposedsweeping restrictionson those same young people’s access to certain information,including political posts. A closer look at the newly announced youth funding reveals much of it is, in fact, earmarked for calcified initiatives like gym equipment and morepolice cadetsthat will fail to holistically broaden horizons.View image in fullscreenChildren and adults taking part in the opening ceremony during the Woodcraft Folk’s Camp 100 event in Northamptonshire.Photograph: Michael Preston for the Woodcraft FolkI was a shy and nerdy child, often bullied by local schoolchildren. There’s a parallel universe in which, retreating from my tormentors, I too could have become detached from the real world, the reclusive screen addict that Starmer fears. But Woodcraft Folk gave me space to flourish in my own way, supported by caring adults. I built profound friendships with peers, learned about big ideas and took on big challenges. My life and career have been immensely richer thanks to those experiences, as have the lives of thousands of others.If the government is serious about empowering young people, they should start by listening to and learning from the movement that’s already been doing it brilliantly for a century.Phineas Harper is a writer and curatorExplore more on these topicsChildrenOpinionScouts and scoutingLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Will we know?Sumaiya MotaraFreelance journalist based in Preston, where she works in broadcasting and local democracy reportingAn older family member recently showed me a video on Facebook. I pressed play and saw Donald Trump accusing India of violating the ceasefire agreement with Pakistan. If it weren’t so out of character, I would have been fooled too. After cross-referencing the video with news sources, it became clear to me that Trump had been a victim of AI false imaging. I explained this but my family member refused to believe me, insisting that it was real because it looked real. If I hadn’t been there to dissuade them, they would have forwarded it to 30 people.On another occasion, a video surfaced on my TikTok homepage. It showed male migrants climbing off a boat, vlogging their arrival in the UK. “This dangerous journey, we survived it,” says one. “Now to the five-star Marriott hotel.” This video racked up almost 380,000 views in one month. The 22 videos posted from 9 to 13 June on this account, named migrantvlog, showed these men thanking Labour for “free” buffets, feeling “blessed” after being given £2,000 e-bikes for Deliveroo deliveries and burning the union flag.Even if a man’s arm didn’t disappear midway through a video or a plate vanish into thin air, I could tell the content was AI-generated because of the blurred background and strange, simulation-like characters. But could the thousands of other people watching? Unfortunately, it seemed not many of them could. Racist and anti-immigration posts dominated the comment section.I worry about this blurring of fact and fiction, and I see this unchecked capability of AI as incredibly dangerous. TheOnline Safety Actfocuses on state-sponsored disinformation. But what happens when ordinary people spread videos like wildfire, believing them to be true? Last summer’s riots were fuelled by inflammatory AI visuals, with only sources such asFull Factworking to cut through the noise. I fear for less media-literate people who succumb to AI-generated falsehoods, and the heat this adds to the pan.AI can help tell great stories – but who controls the narrative?Rukanah MograLeicester-based journalist working in sports media and digital communications with Harborough Town FCThe first time I dared use AI in my work, it was to help with a match report. I was on a tight deadline, tired, and my opening paragraph wasn’t working. I fed some notes into an AI tool, and surprisingly it suggested a headline and intro that actually clicked. It saved me time and got me unstuck – a relief when the clock was ticking.But AI isn’t a magic wand. It can clean up clunky sentences and help cut down wordiness but it can’t chase sources, capture atmosphere or know when a story needs to shift direction. Those instinctive calls are still up to me.What’s made AI especially useful is that it feels like a judgment-free editor. As a young freelance journalist, I don’t always have access to regular editorial support. Sharing an early draft with a real-life editor can feel exposing, especially when you’re still finding your voice. But ChatGPT doesn’t judge. It lets me experiment, refine awkward phrasing and build confidence before I hit send.That said, I’m cautious. In journalism it’s easy to lean on tools that promise speed. But if AI starts shaping how stories are told – or worse, which stories are told – we risk losing the creativity, challenge and friction that make reporting meaningful. For now AI is an assistant. But it’s still up to us to set the direction.Author’s note: I wrote the initial draft for the above piece myself, drawing on real experiences and my personal views. Then I used ChatGPT to help tighten the flow, suggest clearer phrasing and polish the style. I prompted the AI with requests such as: “Rewrite this in a natural, eloquent Guardian-style voice.” While AI gave me useful suggestions and saved time, the core ideas, voice and structure remain mine.Does our environment pay the price of AI?Frances BriggsManchester-based science website editorAI is powerful. It’s an impressive technological advancement and I’d be burying my head in the sand if I believed otherwise. But I’m worried. I’m worried my job won’t exist in five years and I’m worried about its environmental impact.Attempting to understand the actual impact of AI is difficult; the key players are keeping their statistics close to their chests. What I can see is that things are pretty bad. Arecent researchpaper has spat out some ugly numbers. (It joinsother papersthat reveal a similar story.) The team considered justone case study: OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o model. Its annual energy consumption is about the same as that of 35,000 residential households. That’s approximately 450,000 KWh-1. Or 325 universities. Or 50 US inpatient hospitals.That’s not all. There’s also the cooling of these supercomputer’s super-processors. Social media is swarming with terrifying numbers about the data-processing centres that power AI, and they’re not far off. It takes approximately2,500 Olympic-sized swimming poolsof water to cool ChatGPT-4o’s processing units, according to the latest estimates.AI agents such as the free products Perplexity or Claude don’t actually seem to be consuming that much electricity. At most, thetotal global energyconsumed yearly by AI is still less than 1%. But at the same time, data-processing centresin Irelandconsumed 22% of the total electricity used by the whole country last year, more than urban housing. For context, there are80 data-processing centresin Ireland. At present, there aremore than 6,000data-processing centres in the US alone. With the almost exponential uptake in AI since 2018, these numbers are likely to be completely different within a year.In spite of all these scary statistics, I have to hope that things are not as worrying as they seem. Researchers are already working to meet demands as they explore more effective, economic processing units using nanoscale materials and more. And when you compare the first language-learning models from seven years ago to those created today, they have iterated well beyond their previous inefficiencies. Energy-hungry processing centres will get less greedy – experts are just trying to figure out how.If AI is the matchmaker, will I know who I’m dating?Saranka MaheswaranLondon-based student who pursues journalism alongside her studies“You need to get out there, meet lots of people, and date, date, date!” is the cliche I hear most often when speaking to people about being in my 20s. After a few questionable dates and lots of juicy gossip sessions with friends, a new fear emerged. What if they’re using AI to message me?Overly formal responses, or conversation starters that sounded just a bit too perfect, were what first made me question messages I’d received. I am not completely against AI, and don’t think opposing it entirely is going to stop its development. But I do fear for our ability to make genuine connections with people.Pre-existing insecurities about how you speak, write or present yourself make a generation with AI to hand an easy prey. It may begin with a simple prompt, asking ChatGPT to make a message sound more friendly, but it can also grow into a menacing relationship in which you become reliant on the technology and lose confidence in your own voice. The 2025 iteration of the annualMatch.comSingles in America study,producedin collaboration with the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, found that one in four singles in the US have used AI in dating.Perhaps I am over cynical. But to those who are not so sure of how their personalities are coming across when dating or how they may be perceived in a message, they should have faith that if it is meant to be it will be – and if AI has a little too much say in how you communicate, you may just lose yourself.I can see humans and AI learning togetherIman KhanFinal-year student at the University of Cambridge, specialising in social anthropologyThe advancement of AI in education has made me question the idea of any claimed impartiality or neutrality of knowledge. The age of AI brings with it the need to scrutinise any information that comes our way.This is truer than ever in our universities, where teaching and learningare increasingly assisted by AI. We cannot now isolate AI from education, but we must be ready to scrutinise the mechanisms and narratives that underpin the technology itself and shape its use.One of my first encounters with AI in education was a request to ChatGPT to suggest reading resources for my course. I had assumed that the tool would play the role of an advanced search engine. But I quickly saw how ChatGPT’s tendency to hallucinate – topresent false or misleading information as fact– makes it both a producer and disseminator of information, true or false.I originally saw this as only a small barrier to the great possibilities of AI, not least because I knew it would improve over time. However, it has also become increasingly clear to me that ChatGPT, Gemini and other AI chatbots contribute to the spread of false information.AI has rendered the relationship between humans and technology precarious. There is research to be done on the potential implications of AI for all the social sciences. We need to investigate how it is integrated into how we learn and how we live. I’d like to be involved in researching how we adapt to AI’s role as not only a tool but as an active and contributing participant in society.It’s a great tool for architecture – literally shaping the world around usNimrah TariqLondon-based graduate specialising in architectureIn my first years at university, we were discouraged from utilising AI for our architecture essays and models, only using it to proofread our work. However, in my final year, it was introduced a lot more into our process for rendering and enhancing design work.Our studio tutor gave us a mini-seminar on how to create AI prompts so that we could have detailed descriptions to put into architectural websites such asVisoid. This allowed us to put any models or drawings that we created into an AI prompt, asking it to create a concept design that suited our proposal. It gave my original ideas more complexity and a wide range of designs to play around with. While this was useful during the conceptual phase of our work, if the prompts were not accurate the AI would fail to deliver, so we learned how to be more strategic. I specifically used it after rendering my work as a final touch to create seamless final images.During my first and second year, AI didn’t have as much impact on the design process of my work; I mainly used existing buildings for design inspiration. However, AI introduced new forms of innovation, which accelerated the speed with which we can push the boundaries of our work. It also made the creative process more experimental, opening up a new way of designing and visualising.Now I have finished my degree, I’m intrigued to see how much more architecture can grow through using AI. Initially, I believed AI wasn’t the most creative way to design; now, I see it as a tool to improve our designs. It cannot replace human creativity, but it can enhance it.Architectural practices always ask job applicants for skills in software that uses AI, and you can already see how it is being incorporated in designs and projects. It has always been important to keep up to date with the latest technological advancements in architecture – and AI has reaffirmed this.The panel was compiled by Sumaiya Motara and Saranka Maheswaran, interns on the Guardian’s positive action schemeExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The panelUniversitiesJournalism educationArchitecturecommentShareReuse this content"

Tim Dowling’s week in the world’s most divisive shoesView image in fullscreenTim Dowling wearing the barefoot shoesPhotograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“The overwhelming sensation, however, is one of horrifying self-consciousness – these are very weird-looking shoes. No one comments as I walk down a busy shopping street, and after a while I begin to hope no one has noticed – after all, I don’t tend to notice other people’s shoes when I’m out and about. Then I look down and think: yeah, but I would notice these.”Twenty years after they first hit the shelves, five-fingered shoes are having a big fashion moment. But, asked an intrepid Tim Dowling, what is it like to wear them in public?Read more6.From the World Cup logo to new club crests, football designs are losing an edgeView image in fullscreenA collection of World Cup 1970 posters designed by Lance WymanPhotograph: Courtesy Lance WymanLogo design for sport has produced some of the most memorable graphic design in history, notably US designer Lance Wyman’s work for the 1968 Olympics and 1970 World Cup (above) in Mexico.

It was moving west at 17mph and was expected to pass near the Leeward Islands on Saturday, bringing 2-4in (5-10cm) of rain to some areas, with up to 6in in the heaviest downpours.The storm’s outer bands of rain were beginning to affect some islands, and more rain was expected on Sunday, NHC forecasters said.“Swells generated by Erin will affect portions of the northern Leeward Islands, theVirgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and Caicos Islands through the weekend,” the NHC said.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.Hurricane Erin – loopThe swells would spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda and along the east coast of the US early next week, it said, warning of rough ocean conditions and “life-threatening” rip currents.The winds had more than doubled in speed in the past 24 hours, from a 70mph tropical storm on Friday to a 145mph category 4 on Saturday.Tropical storm watches were in place for the northern Leeward Islands of St Martin, St Barts, Anguilla and Barbuda, with rainy conditions possible there for the next 48 hours.Erin is the first major Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season and is expected to strengthen as it passes over warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures. A major hurricane is one that reaches at least category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.Tropical storm turns into Hurricane Erin as it approaches Puerto Rico and Virgin IslandsRead more“By the middle of next week, Erin is forecast to at least double or triple in size, which will result in rough ocean conditions over the western Atlantic,” the NHC said.This rapid intensification is happening more frequently as global temperatures rise due to global heating.The US government has deployed more than 200 employees from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and other agencies toPuerto Ricoas a precaution. Forecasters issued a flood watch for the entirety of Puerto Rico – a US territory – from late Friday into Monday.Puerto Rico’s housing secretary, Ciary Pérez Peña, said 367 shelters have been inspected and could be opened if needed.The US coast guard said on Friday that it closed six seaports in Puerto Rico and two in the US Virgin Islands to all incoming vessels unless they had received prior authorization.Meanwhile, officials in the Bahamas said they prepared some public shelters as a precaution as they urged people to track the hurricane.“These storms are very volatile and can make sudden shifts in movement,” said Aarone Sargent, the managing director for the Bahamas’ disaster risk management authority.Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsHurricanesPuerto RicoVirgin IslandsCaribbeanExtreme weatherUS weathernewsShareReuse this content"

He was 65.Iles died on Friday after a decades-long battle with the blood cancer multiple myeloma, his literary agent, Dan Conaway, posted on Saturday on Facebook.Initially diagnosed with the incurable condition in 1996, he kept his illness private until completing his final novel, Southern Man, which was published in 2024.Iles was born in Germany but moved to Natchez,Mississippi, with his family when he was just three years old and developed a deep connection with the region. Many of his stories are set in Mississippi, including the Natchez Burning trilogy, historical fiction suspense novels exploring race and class in the 1960s Jim Crow south.Conaway described Iles as “warm, funny, fearless, and completely sui generis”.“To be on the other end of the phone as he talked through character and plot, problem-solving on the fly, was to be witness to genius at work, plain and simple,” he wrote on Saturday. “As a writer he fused story-craft, bone-deep humanity, and a growing sense of moral and political responsibility with the ferocious precisions of a whirling dervish or a master watchmaker.”In March 2011, Iles suffered a ruptured aorta and a partial leg amputation and spent eight days in a medically induced coma after another driver struck his car on Highway 61 near Natchez. He eventually recovered.Iles performed with the musical group the Rock Bottom Remainders along with popular authors Stephen King, Amy Tan and others.A 2005 Guardian article on Ilesdescribedhim as a “master of southern US gothic crime-writing”.Explore more on these topicsMississippinewsShareReuse this content"

Zuhri had come to Italy with her mother on one of three Italian air force flights that arrived this week with a total of 31 critical patients suffering from serious congenital diseases, wounds or amputations, the Italian foreign ministry said at the time.According to the University hospital of Pisa she had a “very complex clinical picture” and was “in a profound state of organic wasting”, doctors said in a statement.On Friday, after undergoing tests and starting treatment, she had a sudden respiratory crisis and cardiac arrest, and died.The hospital did not elaborate on her condition, but Italian news agencies reporting health facility sources said that she was suffering from severe malnutrition.More than 180 children and young people fromGazahave been brought to Italy since the war began between Israel and Hamas.According to the UN World Food Programme, one-third of the Palestinian population in Gazagoes for days without eating, and half a million are on the brink of starvation, it said in July.“The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)said last month, calling for an urgent ceasefire to alleviate “widespread starvation”.According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) another five people died last week due to malnutrition and starvation, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 227, including 103 children, since October 2023.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,claimed last month: “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza.”However, even Donald Trump, Netanyahu’s key international ally, when asked if he agreed with the Israeli PM, said: “I don’t know … those children look very hungry … that’s real starvation stuff.”Thousands of sick children in Gaza need urgent medical evacuation, according to OCHA.Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the agency, recalled the moment she recognised a young girl requiring treatment in a Gaza hospital that she had met a year earlier, once again suffering from malnourishment.“I remembered her long eyelashes,” the veteran humanitarian told UN News, describing seven-year-old Janah, whom she came across at Gaza City’s Patient Friendly hospital on Tuesday.“The first time I met her was in the IMC Field Hospital in southern Gaza in April 2024. Back then, she was severely malnourished and was getting treatment. And she gradually became better and was released eventually and went home.”However, Janah was now back in hospital “because the malnutrition became aggravated and the condition that she has also is not properly diagnosed and cannot be properly diagnosed”.The girl was on a list of people to be medically evacuated for treatment outside Gaza. The most recent evacuations took place on Wednesday when the World Health Organizationsupportedthe transfer of 32 children and six adults to Italy, Belgium and Turkey, but more than 14,800 patients are still waiting.Cherevko stressed the importance of ensuring that evacuations continue to save as many lives as possible.She pointed out that for children and adults with pre-existing conditions, their situation becomes worse with malnutrition.“It wouldn’t be this way if they had proper nutrition, because these conditions existed before the starvation crisis and they weren’t getting as sick as they are now,” she said.On Saturday the Israeli military announced it was preparing to relocate Palestinians as it launches a new offensive to seize control of northern Gaza City in a plan that has raised international alarm.Explore more on these topicsItalyGazaPalestinian territoriesEuropeFamineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Rossignol said child-free spaces amounted to “organising society around people’s intolerance of others” and served to “institutionalise and legitimise intolerance”. Rossignol said these resorts “allow people to say: ‘I don’t like children and I don’t want to see them.’ And that is not acceptable, because to not like children is to not like humanity itself.”Child-free resorts and hotels – often advertised with images of relaxed adults on sun-loungers undisturbed by kids shouting or dive-bombing in the pool – have expanded across the world in recent years, and businesses say demand has risen since the Covid lockdowns. For decades, hotels reserved for adults have been popular in locations such as Mexico and Central America, Thailand and Greece, attracting many northern European tourists, including Germans and Britons. South Korea has also seen a rise inchild-freecafes and restaurants.View image in fullscreenPeople swimming at a four-star camping site in Porticcio resort on Corsica.Photograph: Stephan Agostini/AFP/Getty ImagesButFrance– traditionally family-focused and with one of the highest birthrates in Europe – has instead prided itself on its family-friendly holiday attractions, from towering hotel waterslides to campsites with kids’ clubs. France has relatively few adult-only hotels and resorts, estimated to account for 3–5% of overall tourism, far less than neighbouring Spain, a market leader.As the French birthrate declines and the president, Emmanuel Macron, calls for a “demographic rearmament” of pro-child policies, there is renewed debate over children’s shrinking place in society. Anexpert reportlast year on reducing French children’s screen-time said children must be given more alternatives to phones and take up their “rightful place” in society, including “their right to be noisy”.Véronique Siegel, the president of the hotel section of the UMIH trade union, said child-free hotels were “extremely rare” in France compared with the total number of tourism businesses. She said there was a targeted market and hotels were simply meeting clients’ demands. She added: “For people seeking adult destinations, if there are none left in France because we’re told it’s illegal, would they go to neighbouring European countries, or further afield?”Vincent Lagarde, an associate professor of entrepreneurship and business at the University of Limoges, who studies the business model of child-free resorts, said the top reason holidaymakers chose them was not because they hated children, but because they needed a rest.Lagarde said: “There is a kind of physical and mental exhaustion in French society right now, a need to switch off from professional and family burdens. It’s much more complex than simply not liking children, because my research showed that around one-third or more of these holidaymakers were exhausted parents who needed a break from their family. It wasn’t that they didn’t like children, they just needed a pause from the rhythm of the rest of the year. And I also observed teachers, or people who work with children. These aren’t people who don’t like kids, but people who need a bit of time without them.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sergey Novikov/AlamyLagarde found the second reason people chose child-free resorts was for special time as a couple or with friends – a2014 pollin France found that 56% of parents had gone on holiday without their children, mostly for romantic mini-breaks. Finally, there was what Lagarde called a “perception of luxury” associated with adults-only locations. These hotels could charge higher prices simply because there were no children making noise.Lagarde said that while French anti-discrimination and trade laws were open to interpretation on the issue, no family in France had ever brought a legal complaint against a hotel for not admitting children. He said the sector was likely to continue to grow steadily in France, in the same way that child-free weddings had increased.Jean-Didier Urbain, an anthropologist and author of a recent book,What Our Travels Say About Us, said: “There’s a trend in society to seek more comfort and relaxation, more time to pause, and this is part of that.“Vacations, after all, are traditionally a moment where citizens can detach themselves from their social obligations.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenFranceTravel & leisureParents and parentingHotelsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, local officialscleared awayone of the roadside encampments Trump had complained about, arguing that they could do so in a more humane fashion than untrained federal forces.A justice department order to replace the Washington police chief, Pamela Smith, with DEA head Terry Cole as the city’s “emergency police commissioner” ran into problems after a challenge in federal court by the DC attorney general, Brian Schwalb.Without issuing a direct ruling on the challenge, US district judge Ana Reyes indicated that Smith has to remain in charge.But efforts to increase federal control of the district resumed on Saturday with the order to deploy West Virginia’s national guard.Drew Galang, a spokesperson for Morrisey, said the state’s national guard received the order to send equipment and personnel to DC late on Friday and was working to organize the deployment.A White House official told Reuters on Saturday that more national guard troops were being called in to Washington to “protect federal assets, create a safe environment for law enforcement officials to carry out their duties when required, and provide a visible presence to deter crime”.View image in fullscreenProtester holds a piece of bread as he walks past national guard, in reference to an incident where a man threw a sandwich at a federal agent on Saturday in Washington, DC.Photograph: Alex Kent/Getty ImagesThe Chamberlain Network, a veteran’s group that describes itself as “dedicated to protecting democracy”,commented on Xthat the order for West Virginia’s national guard to police DC was “pulling them away from their core mission of protecting our communities”.“From floods to winter storms, we count on our Guard on in a crisis,” the group said. “They should be home, ready to respond—not on a political policing mission.”Since arriving in Washington last week, about 800 national guard troops under Trump’s direct control have served as a visible presence in public areas, assigned to administrative and logistical duties as well as “area beautification” work,according to the Wall Street Journal.Defense officials had said they would not be carrying weapons but “weapons are available if needed but will remain in the armory,” the US army said in a press release.Democrats introduce joint resolution to end Trump’s ‘lawless’ DC takeoverRead moreA US official told Reuters that a formal order authorizing the national guard troops to carry firearms would be issued but it would largely affect military police officers with sidearms.The White House also said on Saturday that national guard in DC are conducting patrols on foot and in vehicles around the national mall and Union Station, adding that the troops are not making arrests at this time.Trump has indicated that he may take similar actions in other Democratic-controlled cities. A federal judge in San Francisco is expected in the coming weeks toissue a rulingon whether Trump violated the law bydeployingnational guard troops to Los Angeles in Junewithout the approvalof California’s governor, Gavin Newsom.Typically the national guard is deployed only instances where a state governor requests it.

The former red beret paratrooper and current president of a Rockhampton canoe club is explaining to a first-time paddler why he won’t begin on a K1 – the kind of craft the world’s best canoe sprinters will paddlewhen and if they come hereto central Queensland to compete at the 2032 Olympic Games.“It’s like sitting on a pencil,” Miller says. “If a crocodile so much as tapped your hull, you’d be straight into the drink!”The club secretary, John Mackenzie, admonishes him: “You had to use the C-word.”To be fair to Miller, the proximity of the world’s largest living reptile is not much of a secret. On the wall of the humble green shed belonging to the Fitzroy Canoe Club is a mascot of sorts: a toy croc called Fitzy. Pinned to the noticeboard are tips on being “Croc Wise”. The club’s paddling area is a known crocodile habitat, the note reads. Enter boats “briskly”. Don’t drag arms and legs in the water. If you capsize, get out as soon as possible.In March, the Queensland government announced that the Fitzroy River in Rockhampton, about 500km north ofBrisbane, would host rowing and canoeing events at the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.map of queenslandScattered along the banks of the Fitzroy are signs warning of injury or death from saltwater crocodiles. A four-metre croc can be right beside you in the water, invisible, one reads.Visitors to the “beef capital of Australia” are extremely unlikely to see a live saltie.But they won’t miss representations of the prehistoric ambush predator throughout the grand sandstone and wrought iron buildings of the river port. In the lane behind the newly refurbished Rockhampton Museum of Art is a crocodile mural, 18 metres long and five metres high.But now the C-bomb has been dropped, the jokes are carpeted.View image in fullscreenThe Fitzroy Canoe Club secretary, John Mackenzie, had a ‘majestic encounter’ with a saltwater crocodile.We hop out to our boats atop the backs of crocodiles, Miller reckons. But don’t worry, the crocs aren’t hungry – “we feed them all the time”.After the gags, Miller gets serious. You won’t encounter a croc, he promises. Just enjoy the river, there isn’t a better one between here and the mighty Murray.And with that, as the pinks and purples of dawn filter through the leaves of paperbarks that line the Fitzroy’s banks, the canoeists paddle off into the mist that rises from the chalky brown water.Corellas screech from towering gums. Pelicans break the still surface of the river. An osprey peers down from the branches of a dead tree. The kayak quivers as its rudder hits a clump of duckweed.The canoeists paddle upstream, away from the city and the barrage that divides the Fitzroy between its salt and freshwater reaches.This piece of infrastructure is one reason Miller contends the river is “pristine”. Unlike those to the south, the freshwater Fitzroy is not swept by tides, lined by mud and mangrove or racked by wind and wave.View image in fullscreenThe Fitzroy River barrage.Photograph: Sylvia Liber/The GuardianThat concrete barrier, built as a water storage system to help meet the region’s water supply needs, also marks a boundary on the government’sQueenslandcrocodile management plan between targeted management and general management zones.Upstream of the barrage for 20km, park rangers are tasked with removing “all large crocodiles” and any croc “displaying dangerous behaviour” from the water.After a couple of kilometres, a pair of canoeists pass through a stretch of river they claim is the territory of a croc about the length at which it is officially considered “large” – that is, longer than 2 metres.A few kilometres farther upstream is the spot that one canoe club member sighted a 4.5 metre saltie two years ago. After several weeks, it was captured and removed.View image in fullscreenA crocodile safety sign along the Rockhampton riverside.This is winter, too – the same time of year that sunny Queensland will host the summer Olympics – and the period in which crocs are most easy to spot, basking their cold blood on riverbanks.Yet, statistically, Miller is almost certain to be right. The Boyne River, more than 100km to the south, is officially considered the southern boundary of typical crocodile habitat.Here in the lower reaches of croc country, the number and density of these apex predators is far lower than in the far away tropics to the north. A government monitoring program estimates the number of crocodiles in rivers of the Cape York peninsula – more than 1,500km to the north – at three crocodiles per kilometre. That ratio declines southward, down to 0.2 crocs per km on the Fitzroy.View image in fullscreenSaltwater crocodiles were declared a protected species in the 1970s after the population was decimated by hunting.Photograph: imageBROKER.com/AlamyThe canoe club has been paddling here since the late 1970s without incident. They are on the water almost every day, often starting in the dark. So, too, their rowing counterparts, who are also looking forward to hosting the Olympics.Mackenzie says he has been paddling in the river for the past seven years and has seen a croc upstream of the barrage only once.It was during the colder months and the saltie had its snout out of the water. During the central Queensland winter, he says, crocodiles aren’t breeding, aren’t territorial and aren’t hungry. He wasn’t worried at all.“It was doing its thing, and I was doing mine,” Mackenzie says. “It was quite a majestic encounter”.Other local water users aren’t so enamoured of sharing the water with these toothy reptiles.Steve Diehm grew up five minutes from the boat ramp above the barrage on the banks of the Fitzroy and has spent his whole life in Rockhampton. An avid waterskier, Diehm had a boat before he had a car.View image in fullscreenSteve Diehm stopped waterskiing on the Fitzoy River because of his fear of crocodiles.Photograph: Sylvia Liber/The GuardianThe Fifo oil and gas worker met his wife and raised his three children waterskiing. But, over recent years, Diehm began being gnawed by a sense of unease familiar to many north of the tropic of capricorn.Since they were protected in the 1970s after being hunted to near annihilation, saltwater crocodiles – which despite their name also inhabit freshwater environments – have been steadily returning to their former range, reclaiming waterways that people swam for decades.Diehm had always been aware he was in croc habitat but began to feel less and less safe. Then, when he saw a picture of that 4.5 metre saltie captured in 2023, a “horrible feeling” wrenched his stomach. He had skied that “exact bank” for 15 years. Diehm thought about his children.The 46-year-old was devastated when he made the decision that it was no longer safe for his family to be on the Fitzroy.Looking out across the river gives Diehm a pang of remorse. It is perfectly smooth, basking in sunshine, a “skier’s dream” – and there is not a soul on the water.View image in fullscreenScott Lawton and Andrew Miller paddle along the Fitzroy River, which will host 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games events despite concerns about increasing crocodile numbers.Photograph: Sylvia Liber/The Guardian“This should be like the Murray Darling,” he says. “There should be houseboats workin’ on here. There should be, you know, park a houseboat, swim off it, ski off it.“All this, all the way up here, there’s this ability for tourism, for so much good, old-fashioned, outdoor fun.”Diehm believes the Olympics would be great for Rockhampton but, without a change to crocodile management, he reckons athletes will be “running the gauntlet”.The University of Queensland’s crocodile expert, Prof Craig Franklin, runs the world’s largest and longest active crocodile tracking program.The Fitzroy Olympics plan “worries” him “on a number of levels”.View image in fullscreenAndrew Miller encourages visitors to forget their crocodile fears and enjoy the Fitzroy.“No. I don’t believe it’s safe,” he says. “I think it’s foolish.”Franklin fears the Olympic event sends the message that it is “OK to go swimming” in places like the Fitzroy. But crocodiles travel vast distances over short periods, crossing barriers and moving overland for several kilometres.“Rowing in a place where it’s the natural habitat of the world’s largest species of crocodilian and, arguably, the most dangerous?” he says. “Why would you do that?”For Mackenzie, though, there is no other river like it.Still flush from his early morning canoe as he sips a coffee at his regular cafe near the river, the retired financial planner reflects that many people worry about all the wrong things. In the year to early August, 178 people have died on Queensland roads.That morning, Mackenzie watched the Fitzroy’s surface ripple with the movements of big catfish, barramundi and bum-breathing turtles.So, yes, he knows there are risks when he gets on to the water, but they are ones Mackenzie gladly accepts.One of the beauties of this river, he says, is that it’s alive.Explore more on these topicsCrocodilesQueenslandBrisbane Olympic Games 2032featuresShareReuse this content"

Changing winds and sheer luck also played a part.“When a fire hits,” says the mayor, “it really leaves its mark.”Thissummer’s fireshave already left their mark across the length and breadth of Spain, from Galicia and Castilla y León in the north-west to Catalonia in the north-east, fromthe smart suburbs outside Madridto Extremadura in the south-west, and all the way down to the beaches of Tarifa in Andalucía.View image in fullscreenA man runs away from the flames during a wildfire in the province of Ourense.Photograph: Miguel Riopa/AFP/Getty ImagesAs well as panic and the increasingly familiar tang of smoke, this year’s fires have brought with them a sense of deja vu.The hot, deadly summer of 2022 yielded images that laid bare Spain’s huge vulnerability as the effects of the climate emergency became increasingly plain. Footage thatwent around the world that Julyshowed Ángel Martín, a 53-year-old man from Tábara in Castilla y León, using one of his excavators to try to stop the fires in the Sierra de la Culebra reaching the town. In the video, the machine is engulfed by the flames before Martín runs out of the inferno, the clothes burning off his frame. Martín,a much-loved figure in Tábara, suffered burns to 80% of his body and died in hospital three months later.Three years on,Spainis once again on the defensive.“The fires are one of the parts of the impact of that climate change, which is why we have to do all we can when it comes to prevention,”the country’s environment minister, Sara Aagesen, told Cadena Ser radiothis week.“Our country is especially vulnerable to climate change. We have resources now but, given that the scientific evidence and the general expectation point to it having an ever greater impact, we need to work to reinforce and professionalise those resources.”View image in fullscreenA resident of Paüls found his horse after it ran away, scared by the fire.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOn the climate emergency frontlineAs politicians engage in blame games, experts warn, once again, that all thebickering over the number of water-dumping planesmisses the point. The current spate of fires, they add, was entirely predictable and underlines the need for a fundamental rethink of land use and management in a continent that is on the frontline of the climate emergency.“This year’s fires are basically on the same level as those we saw in 2022 and 2023,” says Marc Castellnou, the head of forestry for the Catalan regional fire department and a fire analyst at the University of Lleida.“Since 2017, we’ve seen this change towards more extreme fires … It’s nothing new – and it’s happening because climate change is bringing higher temperatures for much longer periods.”The dynamics are not hard to discern. If you have annual heatwaves that arrive one after the other – and last longer and longer – in a country where decades of rural depopulation have left huge areas of land untended, overgrown or given over to homogenous cultivation, then you will have massive fires that are getting harder to fight. As one Spanish scientist notedearlier this week: “We have all the ingredients for the molotov cocktail we’re seeing right now.”View image in fullscreenWildfires are increasingly caused by accidents or negligence and are spreading because of landscape change as well as climate change.Photograph: Miguel Riopa/AFP/Getty ImagesCristina Montiel, a professor at Madrid’s Complutense University and an expert in forest fires and land use, says that while Spain’s firefighters and other emergency services are doing an “extraordinarily magnificent” job that is keeping far greater disasters at bay, the problem lies with society as a whole.Despite the annual fires and the abundance of evidence, she says, “it turns out that we are not – and we do not want to be – aware of the danger in which we’re living”. If we were even a little aware, she adds, “we would take the measures and decisions to protect ourselves”. Fifty years ago, says Montiel, most forest fires were intentional. But today’s forest fires are increasingly caused by accidents or negligence and are spreading so voraciously because of two factors: landscape change and climate change.It is an explosive combination. This year’s heavy spring rains led to an increase in plant growth that has now been dried out by successive heatwaves, leaving all that combustible vegetation, much of it in neglected areas, ready to serve as fuel for the fires. The situation is further complicated bythe phenomenon of “flash droughts”, which can quickly dry out even well-irrigated agricultural land, and which are likely to become more common as global heating continues.Paüls is a case in point. Its population has dwindled over the decades and fewer and fewer people in the area work the land because of the shrinking economic rewards.“If there were 100 people working the land before, now there are 30,” says Adell. “If the same policies continue and things remain as hard as they are, then in a few years, there’ll be almost no one.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month’s fire, says the mayor, was simply uncontrollable: “We saw that there was no way of stopping it.”If there is much truth in the idea that preparation is all – and in the old maxim that “fires are put out in winter” – the challenge now lies in undoing decades of neglect and bad planning that have seen the landscape forgotten and the appearance of housing developments in hazardous places.But Montiel cautions that the much-needed rethink will be neither quick nor easy.“If things took a turn for the worse 50 years ago, we can now start changing them for the better,” she says. “But you can’t think that starting to change things now will pay off within two summers because that isn’t true. These things are processes.”‘Fire Flocks’ of sheep and goatsThere are, however, already some signs that the message is getting through. After the Horta de Sant Joan fire 16 years ago, a group of shepherds approached the Catalan fire department to ask what they could do to prevent more blazes.The result was theRamats de Foc(Fire Flocks) scheme, in which shepherds coordinate with firefighters to graze flocks of sheep and goats in areas with a high density of undergrowth and therefore high risk of fire.View image in fullscreenA herd of goats guided by nomadic shepherds graze around urban areas to create natural firebreaks near Santa Susana in Catalonia.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersIn areas cleared by the ruminants, firefighters have better access and, as there is less undergrowth, it is also easier to bring fires under control should they break out.“We don’t need more helicopters or firefighters,” says Marc Arcarons, who coordinates the initiative, which was launched in Girona in 2017 under the aegis of the not-for-profit Pau Costa Foundation. “We could buy 200 more helicopters and it won’t solve the problem. It’s all about prevention and management.”There’s no point talking about more aeroplanes. By thinking we just need to put them out we’re creating an unsustainable situationThe scheme also helps shepherds increase their existing incomes as those who participate can sell their meat or cheese at a premium as certified Ramats de Foc, so consumers know the produce is contributing to the preservation of the environment and the survival of traditional agriculture.About 120 shepherds have joined the project, which covers about 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) in Catalonia. Similar schemes are planned or under way in the Canary Islands and Andalucía.Arcarons says that depopulation – and decreasing dependence on woodlands for building material and grazing since the 1960s – has caused what was once a patchwork of vineyards, olive groves and wheat fields to revert to dense forest.Fast-growing and highly flammable pines dominated, undergrowth flourished and this, combined with climate change and more frequent and longer periods of drought, has led to fires that are extremely difficult to control.“It’s like a chimney,” says Arcarons. “If you keep throwing wood on the fire eventually the chimney will catch fire and the house will burn down.”Castellnou agrees that without adapting our landscapes to the realities of climate breakdown, we are sealing our fate.“There’s no point talking about more aeroplanes,” he says. “If we limit our capacity for extinguishing fires by thinking we just need enough equipment to put them out then we’re creating an unsustainable, artificial situation for summer after summer of extreme weather.”Explore more on these topicsSpainWildfiresClimate crisisEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is expected to emit 13m tonnes of CO2annually, while its lifespan could stretch beyond 2050, the year by which the country has pledged toreach carbon neutrality. The country was building coal-fired power plants, said Kang, an activist who heads theYouth Climate Emergency Actiongroup and relocated to this city to oppose the facility, “even as the climate emergency demands an immediate halt to fossil fuel expansion”.But Samcheok is not an outlier. It is a symbol of the stark climate contradiction at the heart of theworld’s 12th largest economy, celebrated for its technological prowess in semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries, yet among the top ten worst global climate performers.Despite South Korea’s impressive climate pledges to reachnetzero by 2050with a40% reduction in emissionsfrom 2018 levels by 2030, fossil fuels still dominate its energy mix: 60% of electricity comes from coal and gas, while renewables make up just 9%, a quarter of the OECD average of 34%.View image in fullscreenThe Samcheok Blue power plant, expected to emit 13m tonnes of CO2 annually.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesMonopoly strangling transitionAt the heart of South Korea’s climate failure is an energy model based on a state monopoly and central planning. Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco), the state-owned energy company, controls transmission, distribution and retail, while its subsidiaries dominate generation, creating structural challenges for competitors. These include Korea South-East Power, Korea Western Power and four other generation subsidiaries that together operate the vast majority of the country’s coal, gas and nuclear power plants.Meanwhile, renewable energy developers face an obstacle course of regulatory barriers. Until recently, windfarm developers had to obtain 28 different permits from multiple ministries in abureaucratic mazewhich created years of delays and significantly increased project costs, making many otherwise viable developments financially unfeasible. Progress was made in early 2025 with the passage of a long-awaited bill aimed at streamlining approvals, although the law won’t take effectuntil 2026.Grid connection remains another hurdle. While electricity demandhas grownby 98% over the past two decades, the transmission network has expanded by just 26%, but attempts to expand the grid have led to bitter local conflicts.InMiryang, South Gyeongsang province, the government tried to compel residents to sell up to clear space for transmission towers and people faced violentcrackdownsduring a six-year standoff.

Butcivic groups warnthe law reinforces the country’s decades-old top-down model of infrastructure development, removing what few safeguards remained around public consultation and environmental review.“We fully acknowledge that renewable energy transition requires transmission lines,” says Kim Jeong-jin from Friends of the Earth in Dangjin, where one project faced more than 10 years of delays due to local opposition. “But the repeated conflicts arise because the electricity is not even for local use, yet it causes damage to our region without any regard for our voices.”The country’s energy strategy is guided by theBasic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand, a15-year forecast revised every two years. But the framework, which dates back to the 1960s, still prioritises centralised, large-scale power generation – a model built for coal and nuclear, and fundamentally incompatible with today’s decentralised, flexible renewable technologies.GraphicPolitical volatility worsens the problem. Each five-year presidential term brings a policy reversal. For instance, in 2017, President Moon Jae-inannounced a nuclear phase-out; his successor, the now disgraced ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol,reversed course five years later. This whiplash undermines any long-term planning for renewables – a problem faced by democracies around the world.The consequences are stark. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent fossil fuel prices soaring, Kepco incurred enormous losses. In 2022 alone, South Korea faced an extra 22tn won (£11.9 bn) in LNG power costs. Yet the government keptelectricity prices artificially low, a political choice that pushed Kepco’s debt to astaggering 205tnwon (£111bn) by 2024.View image in fullscreenThe former president Yoon Suk Yeol reversed the plan to phase out nuclear.Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty ImagesDespite this crisis, meaningful reform remains elusive. This entrenched monopoly system has effectively blocked the clean energy transition, with independent renewable producers struggling to gain meaningful access to a market dominated by fossil fuel interests.Carbon-intensive by designMore broadly, South Korea’s postwar rise relied on energy-intensive industries: steel, petrochemicals, shipbuilding and semiconductors.“This structural dependency on heavy and chemical industries makes the energy transition extraordinarily difficult,” says Park Sangin, a professor of economics at Seoul National University. “These industries are deeply embedded in the country’s economic fabric and require vast amounts of stable, cheap electricity.”Powerful chaebols, or family-controlled conglomerates like Posco, Samsung and Hyundai, exert outsized influence on national policy. Their operations are supported by an electricity market designed for industrial stability, not climate mitigation.View image in fullscreenThe Hyundai shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea. Conglomerates exert outsized influence on national policy.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAnd the problem isn’t just domestic; South Korea also finances and provides the infrastructure for fossil fuels globally. South Korean shipbuildersdominate the global marketfor LNG carriers. Public financial institutions also bankroll overseas fossil fuel projects.One that wasrecently approved, the Coral Norte gas project in Mozambique, isprojected to emit489m tonnes of CO2across its lifecycle. At the same time, South Korea has emerged asone of the world’s top importersof Russian fossil fuels, even as other nations cut ties.“This financing directly contradicts [South] Korea’s climate targets and makes a mockery of the Paris Agreement,” says Dongjae Oh, the head of the gas team at Solutions for Our Climate (SFOC). “It exposes the country’s hypocrisy – adopting climate targets at home while funding climate destruction abroad.”Even climate-friendly institutions continue backing fossil fuels. The National Pension Service (NPS), one of the world’s largest pension funds, remains a major investor in coal and gas projects, despite a2021 “coal-free” declaration. Three and a half years after this announcement, NPS only finalised its coal divestment strategy in December 2024, with a timeline that will delay implementation for domestic assets until 2030.View image in fullscreenWolsong nuclear power plant in Gyeongju, South Korea.

South Korea’s largest polluters made over 475bn won from selling unused carbon credits.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, South Korea’s market-based climate policies have failed to drive meaningful change. The emissions trading scheme (K-ETS) was supposed to put a price on carbon when it launched in 2015.But the system, which hands out free allowances to the largest companies, has insteadcreated perverse incentives, according to campaign group Plan 1.5. The group carried out an analysis and found that South Korea’s 10 largest polluters have made over 475bn won (£258bn) from selling unused carbon credits between 2015 and 2022. The system that was meant to make polluters pay has instead rewarded them.Next generation fights backThere is growing awareness of a climate crisis as the country begins to experience increasingly severe weather. In 2023 46 peopledied in floodsthat displaced thousands. More recently,torrential rainshave again causedat least 26 deaths, followed by arecord-breaking heatwave.In March this year devastating wildfires swept across more than 48,000 hectares (118,610 acres) – roughly 80% of the area of Seoul –killing 31 peopleand destroying thousands of homes. The country’s disaster chief described the situation as “a climate crisis unlike anything we’ve experienced before”.The prime minister, Kim Min-seok,has describedthe climate crisis as “the new normal”.View image in fullscreenAn excavator on a barge near the site of the port under construction for Samcheok Blue. The country has described the climate crisis as like ‘nothing we’ve experienced before’.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesNow a new generation of South Koreans is challenging the status quo through legal action. In February, a group of childrengathered outsidePosco’s office in Seoul. Among them was 11-year-old Yoohyun Kim, the youngest plaintiff in a groundbreaking lawsuit against Posco.The case aims to block the company’s plan to reline an old coal-fired blast furnace, a move that would extend its life by 15 years and emit an estimated 137m tonnes of CO2.“I came here during my precious winter break, my last as an elementary school student, because I want to protect all four seasons,” Yoohyun told supporters. “Spring and autumn are disappearing with climate change – and with them, the chance for children like me to play freely outside.”The lawsuit is the first of its kind globally to target traditional blast furnace production. It follows a crucial ruling by South Korea’s constitutional court last August which found that the government’s climate policiesviolated the rights of future generationsby failing to set legally binding targets for 2031-50.In March, residents and activistsfiled another suitover the government’s approval of the world’s largestsemiconductor cluster in Yongin,backed bya 360tn won (£195bn) Samsung investment. The suit argues that the project’s 10GW electricity demand and new LNG plants contradict climate regulations and corporate sustainability commitments.View image in fullscreenA Kepco employee at work. The company is state-owned and has created structural problems for competitors.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesKim Jeongduk, an activist fromPolitical Mamaswho participated in protests against the Samcheok Blue plant with her child, sees this as a generational struggle.“Growing up in Pohang, I saw smokestacks fill the sky on my way to school every day. My throat would hurt from fine dust, and iron particles would collect on our windowsills,” she recalls.“Adults always said: ‘Thanks to Posco, our region survives.’ I don’t want my child to grow up with that same false choice between a healthy environment and economic survival.”The international data shows that South Korea’s emissions peaked in 2018, and have been falling, with a brief jump after Covid, ever since. The government maintains that it is making progress on its climate goals, although critics argue that it is relying on some wonky calculations around its 2030 emission reduction target, confusing net with gross emissions.“South Korea is actively pursuing bold reduction of coal power generation through prohibiting new permits for coal power plants and phasing out ageing facilities,” the ministry said in a statement, arguing that any remaining coal plants operating beyond 2050, such as those approved before the 2021 ban, would be addressed through “carbon capture and storage technology and clean fuel conversion” in a way “not inconsistent with our carbon neutrality commitment”.But independent analysis suggests these measures fall well short. “The Basic Plan has no specific plan for how to expand renewable energy,” says Prof Park. “There are vague targets, but no timeline, no locations. In stark contrast, the nuclear roadmap is extremely detailed and specific.”His recent research using the Global Change Assessment Model shows the current plan would fall short of meeting South Korea’s 2030 emissions targets by approximately 6-7%.A more ambitious policy focused on offshore wind expansion and a complete phase-out of coal by 2035 could not only meet climate goals but reduce power sector emissions by 82% by 2035.View image in fullscreenOperations – ready-mixed concrete towers – at Ulsan port. Experts say there are no plans for the country to develop renewable.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesWhen confronted with criticisms of its emissions accounting,South Korea’s environment ministry defended its approach: “Our emissions reduction target calculation method considers international regulations and major country cases. Countries like Japan and Canada use similar calculation methods for their 2030 NDCs,” a spokesperson said.The ministry added that although previous targets used the older 1996 IPCC guidelines, from 2024 they have begun using the updated 2006 standards for national greenhouse gas statistics.Back in Samcheok, Eunbin Kang looks out at the coal plant that now dominates the coastal landscape.“I dream of a society where exploitation and plunder are replaced by decentralisation and autonomy,” she says. “I want to contribute to spreading lifestyles and policies that allow everyone to lead a good life without requiring a lot of electricity or money.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe big emittersSouth KoreaClimate crisisAsia PacificGreen economyGreenhouse gas emissionsCarbon offsettingShareReuse this content"

Successive governments in London and elsewhere have refused to engage in diplomatic relations with the entity since.Despite relentless efforts by Turkish Cypriot authorities to win recognition, only the international republic of Cyprus in the Greek-speaking south is acknowledged. When Keir Starmer last year made the first official visit to the island by a British prime minister in more than 50 years, Starmer refused to meet Tatar, instead holding talks with the Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides.Turkey, to this day, maintains about 35,000 troops in the north.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We now look ahead to continued collaboration with HM government in support of a free and reunited Cyprus.”Explore more on these topicsCyprusLabourForeign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As many as 2 million people attend the second biggest street festival in the world every year, held on the August bank holiday weekend.View image in fullscreenNotting Hill carnival has taken place over the summer bank holiday in the capital most years since 1966.Photograph: Alishia Abodunde/Getty ImagesIn the letter seen by the Guardian, the signatories say: “The choice to deploy LFR at Notting Hill carnival unfairly targets the community that carnival exists to celebrate.“The Met has been found to be institutionally racist byBaroness Casey’s independent reviewand trust in the Met has been badly damaged by discriminatory policing.“Targeting Notting Hill carnival with live facial recognition technology will only exacerbate concerns about abuses of state power and racial discrimination within your force.”The letter says that since the Met announced its Notting Hill plan, a high court challenge has been launched by the anti-knife campaigner Shaun Thompson. A Black British man, Thompson was wrongly identified as a criminal, held by police, and then faced demands from officers for his fingerprints.“Mr Thompson was returning from volunteering with Street Fathers, a youth advocacy and anti-violence community organisation, when he was surrounded by officers and held for half an hour. He has likened the discriminatory impacts of LFR to ‘stop and search on steroids’,” the letter said.Campaigners claim the police have been allowed to “self-regulate” their use of the technology. Officers have in the past used a setting that was subsequently shown to disproportionately misidentify Black people.An independent report by the public corporation the National Physical Laboratory found that the Met’s LFR technology, which is called NeoFace, is less accurate for women and people of colour when deployed at certain settings.The report’s author, Dr Tony Mansfield, acknowledged that “if the system is run at low and easy thresholds, the system starts showing a bias against black males and females combined”. There is no legal obligation on the police to run the technology on higher settings, the letter says.In 2018, a researcher at MIT Media Lab in the US concluded that software supplied by three companies made mistakes in 21% to 35% of cases for darker-skinned women. By contrast, the error rate for light-skinned men was less than 1%.The other signatories are senior figures in Privacy Watch, Privacy International, Race Equality First, Open Rights Group, Access Now, StopWatch and Statewatch.The Met said last month the cameras would be used on the approach to and exit from the carnival, “outside the boundaries of the event” itself, to help officers “identify and intercept” people who pose a public safety risk.The Met has said it will only use the technology at settings that demonstrate no racial bias to uncover people wanted for the most serious offences such as knife crime and sexual assaults.However, civil liberty groups were dismayed to discover that the technology has previously been used by police in Wales to target ticket touts.About 7,000 officers and staff will be deployed on each day of the carnival, the Met said.LFR cameras on the approach to the carnival will search for people who are shown as missing and people who are subject to sexual harm prevention orders, police said. Screening arches will be deployed at some of the busiest entry points, where stop-and-search powers will be used.The event is still community-led, but senior politicians have expressed concerns about its safety, resulting in demands that it should be moved to Hyde Park or be ticketed to prevent crushes in narrow streets.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said last week that she would draw up a new legal framework for the use of LFR. “Facial recognition will be used in a targeted way to identify sex offenders or people wanted for the most serious crimes who the police have not been able to find,” she said.The Met and South Wales police have been testing the technology. The Met says it has made 580 arrests using LFR for offences including rape, domestic abuse, knife crime, grievous bodily harm and robbery, including 52 registered sex offenders arrested for breaching their conditions.UK rights watchdog warns against ‘heavy-handed’ policing of Gaza protestsRead moreThe Met deputy assistant commissioner Matt Ward, who is in charge of the policing operation for carnival this year, said the force was aware there were still “misconceptions” about the use of live facial recognition in Black and other ethnic minority communities.“It is right that we make the best use of available technology to support officers to do their job more effectively. That is why we will be using LFR cameras on the approach to and from carnival, outside the boundaries of the event itself. Live facial recognition is a reliable and effective tool. It has led to more than 1,000 arrests since the start of 2024.“Independent testing by the National Physical Laboratory found that at the thresholds the MPS uses the system, it is accurate and balanced with regard to ethnicity and gender, but we know there are still misconceptions about its use, particularly in Black and other minority ethnic communities.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceFacial recognitionNotting Hill carnivalLondonYvette CooperUK civil libertiesRacenewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities said he escaped by donning an outfit he designed to look like a law enforcement uniform.Hardin, who worked in the prison’s kitchen, said he spent six months planning his escape and used black Sharpie markers and laundry he found lying around the kitchen to create the fake uniform, according to the report. Hardin fashioned a fake badge using the lid of a can.“Hardin stated he would hide the clothes and other items he was going to need in the bottom of a trash can in the kitchen due to no one ever shaking it down,” the report says.Two prison employees have been fired for procedure violations that led to Hardin’s escape. They include a kitchen employee who allowed him on a back dock unsupervised and a tower guard who unlocked the back gate that Hardin walked through without confirming his identity. Several other employees have been suspended and one demoted, lawmakers were told this week.The kitchen’s staff was “very lax on security”, Hardin told investigators, allowing him to gather what he needed for his escape. He said he didn’t have any help from staff or other inmates. Hardin had also constructed a ladder from wooden pallets to scale the prison fence but didn’t need it.“[Hardin] stated when he walked up to the gate, he just directed the officer to ‘open the gate,’ and he did,” the report says.After he escaped from the prison, Hardin survived on food he had smuggled out of the prison along with distilled water from his Cpap machine – a device that treats sleep apnea. Hardin also drank creek water and ate berries, bird eggs and ants.“He said his plan was to hide in the woods for six months if need be and begin moving west out of the area,” the report says.Hardin, a former police chief in the small town of Gateway, near the Arkansas-Missouri border, is serving lengthy sentences for murder and rape. He was the subject of the TV documentary Devil in the Ozarks.The report is one of two reviews into Hardin’s escape, which is also being investigated by the Arkansas state police. A legislative subcommittee has also been holding hearings about the escape.Republican state representative Howard Beaty, co-chairperson of the legislative council’s charitable, penal and correctional institutions subcommittee, said the panel hoped to discuss both reports with officials at a hearing in September.Republican state senator Ben Gilmore, who sits on the panel, said he didn’t think the department’s review took a thorough enough look at the systemic issues that enabled Hardin’s escape.“They have focused on the final failure instead of all of the things that led up to it,” he said.The report also cites confusion among corrections officials in the early stages of Hardin’s escape about which law enforcement agencies had been notified.“It is obvious there was a lot of confusion during the beginning stages of opening the command center and of notifications being made,” the report says.Hardin had been misclassified and shouldn’t have been held at the primarily medium-security prison, according to the review. After he was captured, Hardin was moved to a maximum-security prison. He has pleaded not guilty to escape charges, and his trial is set for November.Hardin’s custody classification hadn’t been reviewed since October 2019, the report says.The corrections department’s review says officials had taken several steps since Hardin’s escape, including removing the electric locks from the gates to prevent someone from walking out without an officer present.The report also calls for additional cameras after finding a blind spot on the dock Hardin used – and for any “shakedown” searches for contraband to include mechanical rooms and side rooms.Explore more on these topicsArkansasUS policingUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The family would be taking some time to settle in before speaking about their experience, she added.Shaw, 33, who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, was detained with her son when they attempted to re-enter the US after dropping her two eldest children at Vancouver airport on 24 July, so they could fly toNew Zealandfor a holiday with their grandparents.Shaw’s father, Rod Price, toldRadio New Zealand: “She went to go back across into the US and then I got a frantic call to say that she’s being detained and ‘they’re about to take my phone off me’ and ‘they’re locking me up for the night’.”.Besancon, who had helped to raise money for Shaw’s legal fight, said it had been a “terrifying” and “barbaric” ordeal for her friend.“Sarah thought she was being kidnapped,”Besancon told the Guardianthis week. “They didn’t really explain anything to her at first, they just kind of quietly took her and her son and immediately put them in like an unmarked white van.”Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) confiscated Shaw’s phone and transported the mother and son to the Dilley immigration processing center in south Texas, many states away from her home, Besancon said. Foreign nationals caught up in the Trump administration’simmigration crackdownhavesimilarly been transportedto centres far from their homes, support networks and legal representation.An Ice spokesperson said: “The Dilley detention center is retrofitted for families. Adults with children are housed in facilities that provide for their safety, security and medical needs.” They added that “parents, who are here illegally, can take control of their departure” by self-deporting through a government-issued app.Shaw is on a “combo card” visa, made up of an employment visa, which she obtained through her employment at a maximum security juvenile facility, and an I-360 visa, which can grant immigration status to domestic violence survivors.Father of New Zealand woman held in US by Ice along with six-year-old son voices hope for releaseRead moreShaw had recently received a letter confirming her visa renewal, not realising that the I-360 element of her visa was still pending approval.“It wasn’t until she tried to come back across the border that she realised only half of the combination card – because it’s only one physical card – had been fully approved,” said Besancon.“It has been absolutely horrible,” Besancon said, adding that aside from the staff, Shaw and her son were the only English speakers. She said they were locked in their shared bedroom from 8pm to 8am and not allowed to wear their own clothes.A spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said: “When someone with an expired parole leaves the country and tries to re-enter the US, they will be stopped in compliance with our laws and regulations. If they are accompanied by a minor, CBP will follow all protocols to keep families together or arrange care with a legal guardian. Immigration law will be enforced, and our officers and agents will act accordingly.”Shaw’s case is the latest in a growing list of foreigners facing interrogation, detention and deportations at the US border, including aBritish tourist, three GermansLucas Sielaff,Fabian Schmidt and Jessica Brösche,and aCanadianand anAustralianwho were each held and then deported, despite having valid work visas.The union representing Shaw, theWashington Federation of State Employees, had called for her release.“The trauma this has already caused for her and her son may never be healed,” said Mike Yestramski, the union’s president and a psychiatric social worker at Western State hospital.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandUS immigrationAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Brace for chaosLiv LittleSat 16 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 05.34 EDTShareWhether you’re a devout worshipper at the altar of The Real Housewives (like me), or simply aware of it by osmosis, there’s no denying it’s one of reality TV’s most wildly successful franchises. Since it debuted in 2006 with a peek into Orange county’s elite, the franchise now spansmore than a dozen US citiesand has extended internationally from Sydney to Dubai. Now, nearly 20 years later,London is calling.‘For gays, this is our moon landing’: the unadulterated camp joy of Real HousewivesRead moreDespite its title, the show isn’t really about marriage (most of the women aren’t married, and those who are usually at some point during their tenure experience a messy divorce). What the franchise captures is something far more compelling: a specific sort ofmidlife reinvention. We watch as women (mostly over the age of 40) navigate divorce, grief, success, self-discovery and the pursuit of fame. As the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Brandi Glanville put it: “Andy Cohen [the show’s executive producer] is the only man in Hollywood who hires women over 40.”One of the most enduring qualities of the Real Housewives is that it doesn’t produce throwaway reality stars – it creates cultural icons. Unlike much of reality television, which sees contestants flare up and burn out within a season (or even a few episodes), the Housewives universe invites long-term investment. We follow these women for years (and in the case of Beverly Hills,Atlantaor the OC, for well over a decade) as friendships fracture (always with a healthy amount of drama), marriages begin and end and children grow up (and we can now watch the housewives’ offspring on the spin-off Next Gen NYC). In a genre built on instant gratification and rapid turnover, Housewives rewards patience. It feels less like disposable content and more like weekly event television – something to savour and return to, season after season (and rewatch obsessively).View image in fullscreen‘Bitchy opulence’ … The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.Photograph: Distributor: Bravo Supplier:AETN/Nicole Weingart/BravoThis is how Real Housewives cultivates community. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been at a work event or awkward dinner where the mere mention of the women lights people up – suddenly, you’re not strangers, you’re part of a devoted tribe, debating whether the new New York cast are any good (spoiler: they will never be the same), or reeling from the news that the self-appointed grand dame of Potomac herself, Karen Huger, has been sentenced to prison. Once you’re in, you’re in. And once you’ve found your franchise, there’s no going back.That being said, the Real Housewives ecosystem holds a mammoth vault of episodes and choosing where to start can feel as daunting as it is exciting. The good news is that you can quite literally start anywhere. Each city offers something different, depending on what mood you’re in.Beverly Hills serves bitchy opulence (think Lisa Vanderpump’s blush-pink Villa Rosa). The original New York cast was truly wild – Ramona Singer’s wide-eyed expressions are permanently etched in my memory, and Countess Luann’s song Money Can’t Buy You Class remains a certified banger. Atlanta will have you howling with laughter, delivering some of the best lines in the entire franchise.Then there is The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, which has already cemented its place as one of the franchise’s greatest hits, despite being a newer addition. Largely because the show is based in Utah (the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), it landed a scandal right out of the gate, complete with federal indictments. One of the housewives,Jen Shah, became the centre of national attention following her 2021 arrest and subsequent guilty plea for wire fraud. Forever surrounded by numerous assistants (doing God knows what), Shah projected a lifestyle many suspected was funded by more than just her show salary. The drama drew high-profile fans such as Rihanna. There was also the infamous “How did Heather get a black eye?” mystery. Heather Gay, one of the RHOSLC wives and author of the New York Times bestseller Bad Mormon, later revealed it was allegedly caused by Shah, who is now serving time alongsideElizabeth Holmes(of Theranos fame), and paparazzi have even captured shots of them together in prison.View image in fullscreen‘The best lines in the entire franchise’ … The Real Housewives of Atlanta.Photograph: Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty ImagesMost recently, the show has offered some moments that will tug on even the coldest of heartstrings – particularly involving Mary Cosby (who, yes, famously married her step-grandfather). This season, Cosby’s usually reserved demeanour gave way to vulnerability as her son’s visible struggle with drug addiction unfolded on screen in a way that substance issues had never before been spoken about within the network.My personal greatest love has to be The Real Housewives of Atlanta. It is a masterclass in shade and comedic brilliance. Just look at Phaedra Parks, who serves the coldest reads with the unflappable poise of a lawyer and embalmer (yes, she’s both). Kim Zolciak, the only white woman in the original cast, insisted on wearing weaves. Then there’s Kenya Moore, who was the perfect villain – eventually getting booted due to season 16’s revenge porn debacle – in which she used her haircare launch to allegedly project explicit footage purporting to be of another cast member. Atlanta also introduced the world to NeNe Leakes – one of the rare Housewives to cross over into mainstream entertainment, landing a recurring role on Glee, a stint on The New Normal and Broadway roles in Cinderella and Chicago. She had, and has, actual star power.And what to expect from The Real Housewives ofLondon? Six women from the city’s wealthiest circles (with genuinely pre-existing relationships). Making a return to reality TV is the Ladies of London alum Juliet Angus, the fashion-savvy American who’s already generating excitement among longtime fans. She’s joined by the skincare CEO Amanda Cronin, who may be stepping into the villain role – if the teaser is anything to go by. In one scene, she’s seen yelling: “Go back to Paddington!” and edging close to one of the other wives, though she has described herself as “the light in every room”.There’s the party planner and former pageant queen Juliet Mayhew, and Karen Loderick-Pierce, whose early love of fashion came from her grandfather (part of the Windrush generation), who used to send her clothes from London to Jamaica. Early teasers hint she may emerge as the show’s confessional queen.Rounding out the group is Panthea Parker, who describes the show as “stiff upper lip meets crazy Housewives”. She can apparently drop £140,000 on a single shopping spree without batting a false eyelash. And finally, there’s Nessie Welschinger, a financier turned baker and self-professed tiger mum. The trailer teases high society and even higher drama.The same is true of the extensions to the franchise: the (three-part!) reunions and spin-off shows.View image in fullscreenCircle of strife … The Real Housewives of London.Photograph: Angus Pigott/PROne of the longest-standing cast members of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Kandi Burruss – formerly of the R&B group Xscape (she also co-wrote Bills Bills Bills for Destiny’s Child) – has Kandi & the Gang (featuring her family and restaurant). Meanwhile Zolciak, another original Atlanta housewife, headlined her own spin-off, Don’t Be Tardy, which chronicled her home life with her husband, Kroy Biermann, and their blended family in a more domestic, sitcom-style format.It would be remiss not to mention “Scandoval” fromVanderpump Rules, one of Lisa Vanderpump’s spin-offs, which was quite possibly Bravo’s most viral betrayal to date. Tom Sandoval, a longtime cast member, was caught cheating on his long-term partner, Ariana Madix, with their co-star Raquel Leviss. The drama played out across social media platforms like Instagram, (then) Twitter and dedicated Vanderpump Rules subreddits, on which fans recalled exactly where they were the moment “Scandoval broke”, often noting the precise day and time it dropped. Viewers also debated timelines and theories about how long Sandoval and Leviss had been seeing each other before the reveal, fuelling endless speculation and discussion online. The controversy elevated Madix to almost “god-like” status with brand deals aplenty. It was reality TV at its operatic best.In addition to the spin-offs, the last couple of years have seen frankly drastic makeovers across the franchise. New York ushered in its influencer era – a complete recast featuring younger women with strong social media presences – and has been renewed, cancelled and reportedly renewed (and cancelled) again. Atlanta has welcomed a completely new cast – bringing back OG Porsha Williams and finally elevating her bestie (at least until they appeared on the show together) and longtime “friend of the show” Shamea Morton to full-time cast member with her own intro and storyline. Orange County has blended returning originals such as Shannon Beador and Tamra Judge with newer voices – with some hitting and failing to land.The Real Housewives of London offers those still hungry for yet another universe to lose themselves in – this time, with a completely clean slate. Whether it becomes an instant fan favourite remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: even for those who’ve never sat through a full episode, these women are firmly embedded in the cultural mainstream and thankfully, they’re not going anywhere. The joy of Housewives is that no matter where you begin, it’s never long before you’re all in.The Real Housewives of London is on Hayu in the UK on 18 AugustExplore more on these topicsTelevisionReality TVAtlantaLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But now that Gary Lineker has hung up his boots and bid farewell toMatch of the Dayafter 26 years, Mark Chapman can finally have his moment.While more casual fans won’t be aware of what the veteran broadcaster – affectionately known as “Chappers” – will bring as the new focal point, to the diehards he’s long been a known quantity.Widely respected for his relaxed manner and astute questioning, Chapman, 51, has hosted Match of the Day 2 on Sunday nights since 2013 (while occasionally covering for Lineker) and also presents a number of sports programmes acrossBBCRadio 5 Live.But before establishing himself as one of the top broadcasters in the country, he began his career as a continuity announcer on BBC television in 1996. He then became the cricket correspondent for BBC North East radio, before joining BBC Radio 1 as a Newsbeat sports reader on the Sara Cox and Scott Mills shows – where he developed the nickname “Chappers”. He later joined BBC Radio 5 Live to host 5 Live Sport on Mondays.Alongside his run on Match of the Day 2, he was also BBC Sport’s chief rugby league presenter, fronting its coverage of the Rugby League World Cup and RFL Challenge Cup matches.Chapman is one ofMatch of the Day’s three new hosts, alongside Kelly Cates and Gabby Logan. While Cates will present a UEFA Super Cup highlights show on Wednesday and Logan will present the newly rebranded Match of the Day on Sunday, the three will rotate across the shows throughout the season.View image in fullscreen‘It helps that we’re all really different from Gary,’ says Kelly Cates, left, who joins Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan in Match of the Day’s lineup of hosts.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAHe’s always been passionate about the game, declaring early in his career that he spent his time off “playing football and watching football”. Whenasked to describe himself in three words, he opted for “stroppy, moody and temperamental”.Appearing on the Scott Mills Breakfast show on Friday alongside the other two hosts, Chapman joked with Mills about their time working together. “He never took off his coat,” Mills reminisced, “he was there for a good time, not a long time.”Mills also highlighted one of his BBC diary entries from the early noughties, when the pair went to Magaluf with Jo Whiley. “We went to dinner with DJ Sammy in Palma except for Chappers, who decided to shun a swanky celebrity dinner in order to do research on the Magaluf bar scene. Apparently, when you walk down the street, there are people who physically drag you into bars and force you to drink two pints for two euros with a free shot. Poor Chappers never stood a chance,” the entry read.Others have also said it is Chapman’s warmth, humour and experience that make him a joy to work with. “He’s somebody that knows the game very well, is deeply passionate about it and is very good at providing a space where all the different pundits and people involved feel comfortable,” said Nedum Onuoha, who worked with Chapman onPlanet Premier League.“He tries to get the best out of you. He is very good at being able to create a show that’s enjoyable, and I think that goes a long way in punditry.”Onuoha said Chapman was “really funny and dry with certain things”. He said the presenter always remembered “that it is a game” and wanted people to have fun.“He knows that laughing brings people together, as opposed to arguing about things that honestly don’t really matter. His personality is a great one, he’s fun to be around and that can really make a difference, especially for new people entering the industry.”Chapman lived with his wife, Sara, in Hale, Greater Manchester until her death from cancer in 2020. The couple had three children together.One of the things that will undoubtedly be welcomed by BBC bosses is Chapman’s approach to social media. He hasn’t posted on X since January 2021, which sets him apart from his predecessor, who quit the BBC after an antisemitism row and never shied away from expressing his views on topics from the war in the Middle East to the UK government’s immigration policy.Asked about the principal duties of a pundit in aninterview with the Guardian in 2018, Chapman said: “To inform, entertain and give an opinion. They don’t always have to do highbrow analysis or be controversial – there’s a balance to be found.”Match of the Day’s new rotating line up, featuring two women, is a far cry from the days of Jimmy Hill and Des Lynam at the helm. But while leaning in to the change, Chapman and his co-hosts have worked to avoid comparisons to their predecessors.“It helps that we’re all really different from Gary [Lineker], in that he does it with a profile of his own as an England legend,” Cates has said. “It’s a very different career path. An ex-player taking over would be more of a direct comparison.”Explore more on these topicsMatch of the DayGary LinekerBBCSport TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yes, that’s right – it’s basically Bluey meets TolstoyRhik SamadderSat 16 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareLike schoolboys, my friend Charlie and I send each other coded messages. One of these is “Am back on the horse”, which means “RewatchingBoJack Horseman”, which means “Having a mental health crisis”. The recipient knows to go to the other’s house with Danish pastries and some grass to touch. That show changed my life. The Simpsons had redefined what a cartoon could be, Ren & Stimpy and South Park were transgressive thrill-rides. But Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s tale of a washed-up actor chasing redemption wasn’t just adult; it was profound.So I was worried, approaching the new animated series from that show’s creators. It’s not about celebrity. There are no talking dogs or porcupines, or underwater worlds. No Will Arnett. How could I watch without expectation? It feels unfair yet unavoidable to keep an artist’s previous work in mind. Isn’t that like comparing a current partner with an ex?While it lacks a famous horse, Long Story Short (Netflix, from Friday 22 August) is its own beast, and no less ambitious. It’s a family saga told in multiple timelines. The Schwoopers are an argumentative, chaotic Jewish household. Each episode focuses on a character or relationship, swooshing back and forward in time, from the 1950s to the 2020s, as they navigate romance, coming of age, marital breakdown, parenting, old wounds, joy, death and purpose. Basically, it’s Bluey meets Tolstoy.The Jewishness is not incidental. The show is Jewish inside and out, defiantly, delightedly so. Naomi Schwartz is presented as a classic Jewish matriarch, impossibly critical yet overbearingly proud of her children. Daughter Shira is more modern. (“We’re a lesbian couple with biracial, Jewish sons. We’re impressive,” as her partner Kendra puts it.) In the episode Yoshi’s Bar Mitzvah, teenager Danny (voiced by Dave Franco) celebrates his friend’s public speaking. “Dude, your davening was on point!” he hypes. “Mr Leibowitz was kvellin’ like a felon!”It almost goes without saying: melancholy. Most dramas have a primary time and place, flashing back in a limited way. Long Story Short doesn’t privilege any of its periods or people. There is only the equalising process of decades passing or rolling back. The time-hopping is extraordinarily effective, bringing characters back from the dead, fleshing out relationships, grounding us in moral complexity. We feel the painful beauty of our bounded lives.It almost even more goes without saying: funny. Long Story Short delights in language games, subversion, absurdity and surprise. Hapless Yoshi gets conned into becoming a salesman for explosive mattresses in a tube. (Yes, there’s a soft launch.) Avi’s daughter Hannah’s school has been invaded by wolves, but no one seems concerned. Kendra and Shira have a dog, named the Undeniable Isadora Duncan. I guess there are animals in this one.View image in fullscreenCritical thinking … (from left) Edelstein with Max Greenfield as Yoshi Schwooper and Paul Reiser as Elliot Cooper in Long Story Short.Photograph: NetflixCharacters talk a mile a minute, particularly at the Schwoopers’ dinner table, and it takes a while to key into the frenetic pace. ButBoJack Horsemanalso took a minute to find its hooves. (In fact, the first season improved so drastically in its second half, website IndieWire changed its reviewing strategy to only award scores after watching entire seasons.) Here, I was locked in by the second episode. It’s rare for me to actually LOL, watching comedies. But I did, repeatedly – such as when Shira is flummoxed by a reCAPTCHA asking her to pick out squares containing bisexuals. (“How am I supposed to …?”) Kendra is unimpressed. “Where are your glasses? It says bicycles.” But above all, it’s beautiful. The show is interested in the moments when one’s heart splits open. The final scene of an episode in which Kendra attends shul for mercenary reasons pierced me with its humanity.The poignancy is baked into its innovative structure, reminding me of the Sondheim musicalMerrily We Roll Along, perhaps a little ofPachinkoand the film Boyhood. It wears its formal brilliance lightly, and at 10 episodes of 30 minutes, Long Story Short doesn’t outstay its welcome. It’s rewarding company, even if you don’t catch everyFiddler on the Roofreference. I’m glad it’s already been renewed. As with loved ones I have lost, I want more time.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherAnimation on TVBoJack HorsemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I inhaled all six episodes of the show’s first season only a few weeks ago, after a glowing review on the podcastThe Watch(which was also fairly late to it, making me feel a little better about my own finger-off-the-pulseness). Anyway, it’s absolutely terrific, an end-of-the-world chiller that is vividly, realistically rooted in the socio-politics of the country in which it is set. This despite a premise that sees Buenos Aires beset by an unseasonal flurry of what turns out to be killer snow.That specificity, as anyone familiar with The Eternaut will know, is mixed into the story’s foundations. The show is based on Héctor Germán Oesterheld’s 1957 comic strip of the same name, which proved eerily predictive of the civil unrest and lurch into authoritarianism that would beset the country in the following decades. Of course, the reason for said unrest is very different: in the show and comic, an alien invasion causes the snowfall, while in real life it was in response to the installation of a military dictatorship. But the effects are similar: distrust between communities, paranoia and violence. Indeed, Oesterheld would be a victim of the turmoil he imagined in his strip: having joined a leftist group opposed to Argentina’s ruling military junta, he, as well as his four daughters (two of them pregnant) and four sons-in-law,were disappeared in 1977, and a new appeal to find the family members was launched in the wake of Netflix’s adaptation.Said adaptation goes light on anything overtly political, but itpulses away under the surface. For example, the show’s primary character Juan (played by the veteran Argentinian character actor Ricardo Darín) has been aged up from the original series into his 60s – old enough to remember the days of the junta and be uniquely chilled by the prospect of societal breakdown. Juan is haunted by memories of the Falklands war, still a traumatic conflict for some. And at a time when the country is experiencing the effects of a new, hyper-individualist rightwing government, plenty have thrilled to the show’s gentle ethos of collectivism as its characters work together to keep something resembling a society afloat (though The Eternaut’s paean to solidarity might be undermined for some by its use in one scene ofgenerative AI).The Eternaut is just one of aneastern seaboard-destroyingwave of foreign-language dystopian or post-apocalyptic series available, and readily lapped up, by English-language viewers. Once the only role the likes of Seoul, Cairo or Buenos Aires would play in end-of-the-world dramas was to be vaporised, flooded or beset by zombies in Hollywood productions, as a way to demonstrate the threat that (the far more important) American cities were about to face. Now though, thanks to the continent-crossing capabilities of streaming, audiences are able to see other countries’ often terrifying visions of societal collapse.View image in fullscreenHiding behind the iron curtain … 1983.Photograph: Krzysztof Wiktor/NetflixAnd those visions come in so many shapes and sizes. In Korean dramaBlack Knight(Netflix) air pollution has rendered oxygen a much-fought-over commodity, hoarded by elites in gated communities. In the surveillance state hellscape of Dutch series Arcadia (Channel 4) the public are given “citizenship scores” that determine their quality of life, whileAgnieszka Holland’s 1983(pictured above, Netflix) imagines that communist rule in Poland extended into the mid-00s, even as the rest of the iron curtain fell, resulting in an isolated and consequentially brutal police state. Meanwhile, the Nigerian animated seriesIwájú(Disney+), Spanish drama The Barrier and Brazilian drama 3% (both Netflix) all imagine futures where the privileged are walled away from the rest of a struggling society.It seems notable that many of these shows are onNetflix. The streamer’s global expansion march has seen them throw money at original programming everywhere from Turkey to Taiwan, and in quite a few of those territories the result has been dystopian dramas, a genre you have to assume the streamer’s famous all-powerful algorithm considers appealing to audiences outside those territories. Which is understandable: the fear of the end of the world is a universal one. What I find most absorbing about many of these series is a sense of hyper-locality, of being rooted in the traditions, styles and concerns of the specific country.Consider the show Families Like Ours, available on BBC iPlayer, which takes a very real threat to Denmark – rising sea levels – and pushes it to terrifying (and, some claim, impossible) extremes, with its population of 6 million forced to leave the country and become climate refugees. It’s a predicament depicted in a matter-of-fact, almost mundane fashion, with characters shrugging reactions to each new grim developmentlike frogs in boiling water. Families Like Ours is directed by Thomas Vinterberg, the film-maker behind Festen and The Hunt and veteran of Denmark’s Dogme 95 film movement, who here applies its deadpan sensibility to something deeply serious. The result is markedly different from traditional disaster movies, rooted in Danish cinematic traditions and energised by its deepest fears.The same, of course, applies to The Eternaut. A second season, that will conclude the story, is in production, and won’t arrive until 2027. I definitely won’t be so desperately late to it when it arrives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mimicking the interlinked canopy and undergrowth of the forest, he weaves the stories of nine core characters whose lives are deeply connected to trees. Olivia and Nick, for example, set up camp in a giant redwood for a year to prevent it from being cut down. They connect with other characters over their environmental activism, with one tragic consequence.

This is no dystopia, but climate realism. Yet the novel feels fundamentally hopeful, with Ghosh nodding to cross-cultural cooperation as a means of facing climate destruction. Two female characters, marine biologist Piya and historian Cinta, also fortify us. “I don’t think my book is climate fiction at all,” said Ghosh in a 2019 interview. “It’s actually a reality that in hard circumstances humans often discover joy and faith.”View image in fullscreenParable of the Sowerby Octavia E ButlerOriginally published in 1993, Parable of the Sower is set between 2024 and 2027 in a California bordering on anarchy, marked by economic breakdown and climate change. The narrator, Lauren Olamina, suffers from hyperempathy syndrome, meaning she feels the pain of others acutely. She creates a new religion, Earthseed, which posits that humans have the power to “shape God” and enact change.

The box had an illustration of the FA Cup, and in the bottom right-hand corner was a photo of a smiling man with curly hair and a goatie beard. You’d see the same images in gaming magazines adverts – they ran for years because, despite having rudimentary graphics and very basic sounds, the game was an annual bestseller. This was Football Manager, the world’s first footie tactics simulation. The man on the cover was Kevin Toms, the game’s creator and programmer.The story behind the game is typical for the whiz-kid era, when lone coders would bash out bestselling ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 titles in their bedrooms and then end up driving Ferraris around with the proceeds. As a child in the early 1970s, Toms was a huge football fan and an amateur game designer – only then it was board games, as no one had a computer at home. “When my parents went to see my careers master, I said: ‘Ask him if it’s possible to get a job as a games designer,’” says Toms. “He told them: ‘It’s a phase, he’ll grow out of it.’”He didn’t. Throughout the 1970s, he worked as a programmer on corporate mainframes and for a while he was coding at the Open University. “It wasn’t long before I realised I could write games on these things,” he says. “Actually, the first game I made was on a programmable calculator.” In 1980, Toms bought a Video Genie computer, largely considered a clone of the TRS-80, one of the major early home micros. “I realised I could write the football manager board game I’d been trying to make for years on a computer,” he says. “There were two major advantages – it could calculate the league tables for me and I could work out an algorithm to arrange the fixtures.”View image in fullscreen‘In the first few months I sold 300 games’ … Football Manager on the ZX81.Photograph: Kevin Toms/Moby GamesThe Video Genie never took off – but then Toms bought a ZX81 with a 16k RAM extension and ported the game to that. “In January 1982, I placed a quarter-page ad in Computer and VideoGamesmagazine and it started to take off,” he says. “I can still remember the first letter arriving with a cheque in it. In the first few months I sold 300 games.”At this time, the game was extremely basic – there were no graphics, just text. Players picked a team from a selection of 16 and then had to act as its manager: buying players, deciding on a squad, then tweaking the side as it went through the season. You started at the bottom of the old fourth division and worked your way up. Toms wrote his own algorithms to generate fixtures and also decide the outcomes of the matches based on the stats of the teams playing.“The difficult part was the player attributes,” he says. “I gave them a skill rating out of five, but then I wanted a counter-balance that so you couldn’t just buy the best players and leave them in the side for the whole season – there had to be a reason to take them out. In real football, the more you use a player, the more likely they are to get injured, so I incorporated that. Each player had an energy rating out of 20 – it diminished as he played, and the risk of injury increased. There had to be a reason to bring the lesser players in.”Toms also wanted to add long-term strategy and planning to the game, and this came in its most popular element: the transfer market. In the earliest versions of the game, you’d be offered the chance to sign one player a week, but that selection was randomised – you never knew who would be available. “Say you get a rating three midfielder come up and you need to strengthen your midfield: do you spend money on that or do you wait for a five-rated player who might not come for weeks? This generated pressure and fun.”View image in fullscreenInspired by Match of the Day … Football Manager match highlights on the Commodore 64.Photograph: Kevin Toms/Moby GamesThe key problem he faced was memory. The expanded ZX81 had just 16k of it, which made some aspects tricky – including team names. “It was long before all the licensing issues came along,” he says. “My problem wasn’t: do I need to buy a licence to use Manchester United? It was that there wasn’t enough memory to store the name. Every team name had to fit within eight characters, so I chose teams with short names like Leeds – although I did put in Man U and Man C. The players were mostly well-known players of the time – but again, with short names – which is why Keegan is in there. It’s crazy how little memory there was.”Football Manager was first released in the early days of the gaming industry – copies were sold via mail order or at computer fairs. But by 1982, high street stores started to take notice of the emerging video game sector. “WH Smith got in contact and said, ‘We like your game, we want to stock it’, and they invited me down to London. They eventually placed an order for 2,000 units – the invoice for that order was more than I was earning in a year. About a month later, my girlfriend rang me at work and said: ‘Oh another order has come in from WH Smith, it’s 1,000 units.’ When I got home I realised her maths was pretty crap – it was 10,000.”WH Smith placed an order for 2,000 units – the invoice was more than I was earning in a yearToms left his job at the Open University and set up his own company, Addictive Games. The subsequent Zx Spectrum and Commodore 64 versions of Football Manager came with an added component: match highlights, which showed basic graphical representations of key moments, such as goals and near-misses.“It was inspired by Match of the Day – they extract the most fun parts of the matches,” Toms says. “I purposely didn’t put a match timer onscreen, so you never knew where in the match the highlight was happening; you didn’t know how close you were to the end of the match, and whether there was time for another goal. This added to the tension – it was a critical part of the design. There’s also a slight pause between each highlight, and that also creates tension. It was very simple but it worked very well.”The game was a phenomenon, appearing on bestseller lists for years. My friends and I had hours of fun just editing the team and player names. We all remember it now. “I didn’t realise the full impact for years,” says Toms. “There was no internet at the time – although I did get a few letters saying: ‘I played your game for 22 hours straight.’ Or: ‘I failed my mock O-levels because of the game.’” He also knew that football pros were playing, including Arsenal striker Charlie Nicholas and Spurs manager Bill Nicholson, as well as Harry Redknapp, who later had a role as a real-life mentor to a competition-winning Football Manager player in 2010.Toms wrote several other management games afterwards, including Software Star, a simulation of the games industry. But as the number of Football Manager conversions and updates increased, so did the stress. Finally, he sold the company and got out of games, returning to business coding while travelling the world. In 2003, Sports Interactive, the developer of the Championship Manager series, acquired the name Football Manager and rebranded its own game under that title – and the name lived on.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve had people who played the original buying it for their kids’ … Football Star Manager.Photograph: Kevin TomsBut the game wasn’t quite over. Ten years ago, Toms got chatting to fans of his original game online and asked if anyone would be interested in a smartphone translation – Football Manager as they all remembered it, with the same basic visuals. The response was positive and, in 2016, he released Football Star* Manager on mobile. Recently, he upgraded it again and released aPCversion. “People are enjoying it because it’s easy to play,” he says. “That’s inherent in my design philosophy – it must seem simple but have subtle depth or it won’t retain the interest. I’ve had people tell me they’ve played 500 seasons and they have £5bn in their bank account – the balance is clearly right because even with all that money they’re still enjoying playing. I’ve also had people who played the original buying Football Star* Manager for their kids to play.”Toms has clearly rediscovered the spark that brought the original Football Manager into the world, 40 years ago. He has long-term plans for Football Star* Manager, and perhaps Software Star, too. “I’ve still got loads to do,” he says. “I’ve got far more aims and ideas than I have time to implement at the moment. I’m not slowing down. I should do, but I’m not.”Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesSports gamesPCMobile gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is drawn to the dead stranger’s lanyard and, for reasons he can’t articulate, pops it around his neck.The lanyard reads: Ben Manager. Our hero’s ascent through a sinister corporate system begins.This play, created by Bunkum Ensemble, is this year’s winner of the Pleasance’s Charlie Hartill Fund. Through live scoring, puppetry and experimental PowerPoint presentations, the team build an uncanny office environment that slowly drives Ben to the edge of sanity.The cast, with writer Jack Parris starring as Ben, are clad in run-of-the-mill office wear, even puppet colleague Derp (operated in this performance by Teele Uustani). Mike Coxhead and Adam Boothroyd play the live soundtrack from their cubicle desks. Corporate phrases and cliches – circle back, socialise the news – drip from tongues as Ben tries to convince everyone that he’s supposed to be there, and convince himself that he wants to be.But what is his job? “I’m responsible for … I’m just responsible now!” he tells his mum. It’s soon clear that no one’s really doing anything.Ben himself is a bit of an enigma, emanating a desperation and fragile masculinity that’s heightened by the workplace and sometimes plays a little queasily in the room. There’s commentary on the cruelty of business, hypocrisy of “wellbeing” initiatives, and true value of many modern jobs.The ominous, rumbling soundtrack keeps you on edge and an otherworldly atmosphere builds, compensating for strands where the messaging is a little more muddied. As Ben ascends the corporate ladder, we shift into dystopian sci-fi, where senior management are encouraged to self-actualise in surprising ways. But with Ben now initiated into the cult of work, can he let go of the facade of productivity and his precious lanyard?AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalPuppetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a feat of sustained poetic imagination, the playwright describes pregnancy – and pregnancy loss – in terms of space travel. And it is not just a passing analogy but a complete vision, from lift-off to orbit to “Houston, we have a problem”.Remarkably the metaphor does not wear thin. Rather, it powers a beautiful and touching exploration of an intrepid journey undertaken and never completed.Writing from experience, Wilson breaks from the traditional pregnancy narrative early on: not only do they want to have this baby but their mother is delighted for them, too. Performing in spangly astronaut costume, with a helmet that lights up from the inside thanks to Adi Currie’s inventive lighting design, Wilson is an enthusiastic space traveller, ready for a voyage towards the stars.Their boyfriend, known as Nasa, is not so intrepid. Surely Wilson is too young, too irresponsible, too unhealthily addicted to cheese crackers to go on such a mission, he says. His departure will make this a solo trip.F-Bomb Theatre’s production, co-directed by Cora Bissett and Niloo-Far Khan and part of the Made in Scotland showcase, is more weightless than earthbound. Although this is a study of grief and of the difficulty of explaining the loss of an unborn child – especially to those astronauts who have completed a successful mission – the metaphor keeps Wilson from sounding maudlin or introspective.Thanks for Being Here review – Ontroerend Goed’s joyful show puts the audience in the spotlightRead moreFrom the start, they connect more withAstronaut Barbie, a true pioneer when released in 1965, than with Barbie’s pregnant friend Midge or her conventional husband Allan. Wilson’s desire to be a parent is not about settling down but embarking on an adventure. That it is an adventure they do not complete leaves them in an emotional vacuum, sad but for the recruitment of a replacement ground crew.At theGilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalPregnancyFestivalsParents and parentingSpacereviewsShareReuse this content"

Misgendered by a shop assistant, we find Sam in a department store changing room, squeezing into a dress from which they’re then unable to extricate themselves. How to escape this with some shred of dignity intact? It’s a big-hitting and farcical standup sketch, delivered with such self-deprecating joyfulness by Nicoresti that you almost forget the sensitivity of its subject matter.That’s of a piece with the rest of Baby Doomer, a set that addresses with grace and buoyant humour our host’s wrestle with their gender and mental health. No tub-thumping here, just a high-joke-count hour from an act still learning how to be a woman (and quick to caricature how imperfectly they’re doing so) but cocky about their credentials as trans. It’s a step forward, and towards a more mainstream brand of standup, too, afterCancel Anti Wokeflake Snow Culture, the quirky multimedia offering that established Nicoresti three years ago.Thanks for Being Here review – Ontroerend Goed’s joyful show puts the audience in the spotlightRead moreThe show takes that pressure-cooker changing room experience as a prompt to explore Nicoresti’s life in a Britain not always accommodating to a natal male walking down the street in a skirt suit. To whom might they look for a role model? Nicoresti proposes Sméagol/Gollum, greatly to the amusement of fellow nerds in the front row. Are they aunt Sam to their nephew, or uncle Sam? Should marriage be preferred to a polycule, or would it merely endorse the cis-normative status quo?As if to emphasise Nicoresti’s repositioning as a standup who wouldn’t look out of place on Live at the Apollo, there’s a home-banker routine about having sperm frozen (mirroringTim Key’sandIan Smith’s set pieces elsewhere in town), and another about receiving a walking tour-style induction at the local gym – “as if I’m the king”, says Nicoresti, in a choice image. It’s quite the trick Nicoresti pulls off here, never soft-soaping the challenges of life as a trans woman while making of it an ebullient hour of comedy.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Several landmark novels about climate apocalypse and survivalism had been published, includingZ for Zachariahby Robert C O’Brien andThe Death of Grassby John Christopher, but there was no imperative to write about such things. These stories involved anomalistic catastrophes – a mutated virus, nuclear war – and they were very bleak. They resonated but also seemed unusual. At the other end of the scale, Ben Elton’s Stark had comedically outlined the nature of oligarchic greed, resource consumption, and the ruination we were hurtling towards, while the Bezos and Musk equivalents could head off-world – not quite so funny now.The public knew about climate issues, though terminology often stressed them individually – ozone depletion, greenhouse warming, desertification, coral bleaching – rather than total Earth systems breakdown. Disparate, visionary science fictions didn’t indicate a genre movement yet. There was a luxury of choice regarding stories related to nature – no elephant in the room (or polar bear), if you didn’t tackle climate-change concerns.In the 2000s, while the scientific data was righting itself from hacks and attacks, a whole spate of alarming nonfiction books arrived, forecasting the devastating effect of global temperature rises, mass extinctions, and the chaotic world that would occur if our trajectory of fossil fuel consumption, industrial farming, deforestation and the like wasn’t altered. Books likeSix Degrees(Mark Lynas),A World Without Bees(Alison Benjamin and Brian McCallum), and Half Gone (Jeremy Leggett) sounded the doom gong, loudly.As a news-hungry novelist, I responded, wringing jeopardy from these predictions to create a dire, possible future. Full-throttle dystopian speculation seemed to be appropriate. I wroteThe Carhullan Army, which imagines female paramilitary resistance in a Britain destabilised by flooding and politically fascistic, where rationing and population control are the new norms. Looking back, I can see this story arrived out of pure, exhilarated fear about impending ecological disaster, the repressive systems which could arise out of it and their effect, especially, on women. It was an attempt to ring the same warning bell, to create a virtual, experiential realm for the reader out of their propositions.Fiction writers were turning towards the situation. Cormac McCarthy’sThe Road, perhaps the most horrific, cataclysmic fable of this era, while never explicitly naming its disaster, depicts, as George Monbiotnoted, the extreme consequences of “a world without a biosphere”. A decade later,The End We Start Fromby Megan Hunter, imagines a saturated, desolated England, with migration south to north as characters struggle to control their lives. Water shortages, drought and expanding sands feature in Claire Vaye Watkins’ novel,Gold Fame Citrus, where countercultural Californians try to get to grips with a brutal new wilderness almost too big for human comprehension. Too big for comprehension, regarding the world’s threatened environmental state, would become our existential sufferance.View image in fullscreen‘Utopia is difficult to write about’ … Sarah Hall in the Lake District.Photograph: Kat GreenThese issues were not, in fact, speculative, but live around the globe. The ensuing havoc and damages do not affect humans equally. The racial extrapolation of history and culture in relation to climate future is depicted in Tochi Onyebuchi’sGoliath. In it, the abandoned black population of an uninhabitable, cloud-shrouded America search for meaning, home, and connection. Who will suffer and how when the apocalypse descends as a result of society’s legacy, is one of the fundamental concerns. If there are positive human adaptations or consolations to be found in these stories, they are transitory, vestigial or futile – distantly circling birds, an orphan fostered in hell, precarious love, sorority. Hope is dwarfed or excoriated by the monstrous new reality of planetary vastation. Tracking forward from Mary Shelley’sThe Last Man, anxiety around the loss of our habitat and safe, humane civilisation has been the operating key for dystopia.Cli-fi is now its own genre, and booming, its themes curated on bookshops tables. But is pessimism still the prevailing mood? Utopia, it’s said, is difficult to write and perhaps less interesting to read. “Whoever tries to imagine perfection simply reveals his own emptiness,” George Orwell asserted. Darkness is attractive in so far as it’s inherently dramatic to depict, provocative and recognisable. In the face of failure to politically cooperate, legislate and mitigate against Earth systems breakdown, nature-horror and environmental comeuppance might truly represent our feelings of fatalism. Perhaps dystopia serves a purpose, as a repellent. It’s difficult to know whether it acts as a cautionary tale, deterring people from its pathways, or whether it simply provides disturbing entertainment while endorsing the worst-case scenario.But is Orwell’s philosophy correct? Or might the premise be learned incapacity, a defeatist ideology that commits us to mess and devilry, rather than nurturing anything better? Might it hinder solution stories and contribute to a negative cultural paralysis?One man’s utopia is very different from the next woman’s. There have always been positive proposals in science fiction, too, such as the formidable work ofOctavia Butler, which opposes the notion of destructive tendencies in our species and dares to dream up models of evolution. The narratives ofAfrofuturismrise from experiences unlike Orwell’s, exploring themes of black identity and agency and offering alternative, empowered versions of the future. Who is to say what literature can’t be or do?So what is the fiction that needs to be written now? This is the question I grappled with over the decades of writing my novelHelm. Is it about signposting progress when it comes to environmental adaptation and damage limitation? Should writers try to offer a restorative or rousing spirit for the times we live in, an opposition to eschatology? Can literature actually be a tool to encourage something better – creating eco-topia on the page, so it might be imagined off it? Midway through the writing of the book, I took part in a British Council Nature Writing panel in Germany and this last question was asked by the audience. Robert Macfarlane, the chair, barely paused before saying: yes. I remained silent.Since the dystopian days, I had tried a hopeful version of environmental fiction, The Wolf Border, which is about nature recovery and the rewilding of Britain. A good kind of What If scenario, I’d thought. But its premise and its political conditions – Scottish independence and radical land reform – seem more fantastical and remote now than when it was written. The truth is, as I sat quietly on that panel, I felt corseted by old ideas about fiction: that gloom is our territory, that fabricators have a different role to factualists, that novelists aren’t obliged to help steer society out of a negative mindset. My luxury to choose an environmental mode felt hollow.For nonfiction writers, the presentation of issues and ideas is central. They encourage literal engagement with a subject. They can brilliantly advocate, use literature to protest and campaign for conservation. They might move the dial politically, like Rachel Carson’sSilent Springdid, prompting the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. They can reconstruct biased, racialised environments as the cultural geographer Carolyn Finney does. In her book Black Faces, White Spaces, she examines the relationships between African Americans and the natural world, white privilege, historical access to and ownership of the great outdoors, broadening perspectives on the environmental justice movement.With fiction, it is harder to present issues without it being on-the-nose; there are so many moving parts in a virtual world: characters, plots,landscapes, themes. A story might foreground the environment, it might even beaboutthe environment, but it isn’t a manifesto. It is galvanising to see writers such as Monbiot tackling the issues behind industrialism that drive pollution and depletion – neoliberalism, capitalism, the internalised narratives that make us believe consumer economic systems are set and unchangeable – then suggest alternatives. I’ve been struck too readingWild Fellby Lee Schofield, which imagines the future blossoming of ecological work he’s undertaken in the same location where Haweswater and The Carhullan Army are set. I was struck, because I’d never imagined an optimistic vision for my home turf; it seemed like a literary gear I didn’t possess.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

And there’s a wild, inspiring proliferation of books written by women regarding human synergy with nature: hawks, hares, mountains, common land, rivers. These works begin to overcome the immense scale of fatalism.So can fiction.The Overstoryby Richard Powers demonstrates the genuine power of collectives in the fight to protect nature. Barbara Kingsolver’sFlight Behaviourfinds, alongside the shocking planetary transformation affecting all species, a beauty in transition. These novels invite scientists to shout louder and readers to participate more.This became the imperative for Helm. It is a book about a unique aerial phenomenon, Britain’s only named wind, far older than humans and perhaps imperilled because of us. After more than a decade of stalls, rewrites and re-examinations of the topic, I had begun wondering if I should imagine ways up and out of doom scenarios instead of just describing the conflict within them. The answer was yes.The novel tackles issues of climate change, but its tenor is different. Perhaps the very nature of its subject helped: air, levity, mercurial otherness. Nature narrating itself is not new in literature, but remembering that our human story is not separate from nature’s story is timely. The wind, whose biography the book attempts to capture, is a mischievous puckish storyteller, entertained by humans and impervious to its own destruction, so the tone is a bit “tea-party at end-times”. A beautiful indifference is one option for dealing with environmental ruin, if you’ve no agency to alter it. But the character of Selima, a contemporary meteorological researcher studying microplastics in clouds, is more serious and culpable. Selima has the weight of awful facts on her shoulders, along with interference from climate deniers. Her existential crisis is, I think, a version of what we all may feel as isolated individuals, given the overwhelming issues we face. Yet she remains defiant and collegiate; she keeps on going with her work. The end of her story is still speculative, but it leaves room for activism to triumph.There are lots of stories in the novel about how mankind has tried to control the elements over millennia, via industry and religion; how we’ve consumed and damaged nature as our “manifest destiny”. But there are also stories about ways of existing holistically, recognising our place in nature and its place in us. These are mostly the female characters’ stories; they prevail against bad operators, and they are companionable with Helm.The Helm’s-eye overview gives a whimsical perspective of human endeavour, our significant anthropogenic moment on the planet, our solipsism and minimalism in the scheme of things, and a sense of: what next? This allowed for a fundamental shift in spirit towards buoyancy and a rescaling. In the end, it felt as meaningful and right to try to imagine positive countervailing ideas around our ecological impact as the dystopias had previously felt.Helm is far from eco-topia. But I hope the book is a constructive offering for our current moment. I’ve always believed fiction can be vital in allowing readers to apprehend and experience other versions of the world. I’m starting to believe it can play a part in encouraging healthier visions of the environment, by depicting our benign proclivities, and imagining that marvellous natural phenomena like the Helm wind can be saved.Explore more on these topicsBooksScience and nature booksClimate crisisFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My horror marathon in search of stage frightsThis year’s Edinburgh festival is full of creepy shows, from a jaw-clenching haunting to sci-fi terror. Our writer braves the darkness in Auld Reekie’s fringe venues for a day of fearKate WyverSat 16 Aug 2025 08.11 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 08.35 EDTShareIam a wimp. When my friends used to gather to screech over horror movies after school, I would sit watching Countdown with one of their mums until it was over. I had to watchThe Blair Witch Projectwith all the lights on and I never got through the opening scene ofThe Ring. But when it comes to horror on stage, I’ve rarely been fazed. Bar the odd jump scare, how scary can theatre really be? I set out to find out by watching a full day of horror shows at the Edinburgh fringe.I start off gently withElysium, a winding eat-the-rich tale told through lilting song. The gated community of Elysium Court is designed to keep the riff-raff out, but the inhabitants should be more worried about what they’re locking in. With the air of two friends casually making music in their garage, Milly Blue and Jessie Maryon Davies of Ghouls Aloud unpack the concept that exclusivity equals safety, watching from a distance as the containment crushes everyone in Elysium Court into the same make and model – or destroys them if they attempt to stand out.Blue’s storytelling is sweet and unsettling, though occasionally veers off into tangents that don’t serve the story. Davies laces tension through with moody piano, with Blue looping her voice in climbing harmonies above, as strange events begin to haunt Elysium’s newest resident. Digging into the soil beneath the standard-issue astroturf that clamps down every garden in the Court, old monsters start to emerge. The darkness creeps in slowly and the script wants tightening, with some songs pausing the action rather than driving it on, but I decide I like my horror being sung to me. Maybe this was the problem all along.View image in fullscreenOld monsters emerge … Elysium.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianFrom the candy-pink satire of Elysium, the pitch-blackScatter: A Horror Playcouldn’t be a sharper shift. The room is so dark it’s a struggle to even find your seat. This low lighting continues as Patrick McPherson’s jaw-clenching show of hereditary haunting reserves any bright light for blinding flashes. Liberally smattered with jump scares, the show sometimes leans so heavily on Will Hayman’s intense shadows and sharp, saturated filters that the design comes to feel like the main event rather than an anchor to sink us deeper into the story.McPherson plays Tom, a young man reluctantly recounting the trip he and his brother took to scatter their father’s ashes in rural Wales. In the predictably traumatising process, they discover that their dad’s end-of-life aggression, previously brushed off as delirium, was something far more sinister, his acts of violence actually a deeply troubled form of protection. Jonny Harvey’s direction makes repeated use of the classic torch sweeping around a blackened room and heavy, breathless silences followed by piercing, sinew-shaking screams. These old tricks are effective. I sink into my seat every time the torch winds up.A traditional folk horror, Scatter takes itself seriously. You can’t help wondering if the balance of tension would intensify if some lightness was buried anywhere in the text; McPherson’s performance, though convincing, starts off dour and stays similarly severe throughout. The ending is rushed, but Scatter sets out to scare, and it succeeds. As we pick our way out of the theatre, my heart takes a moment to return to its regular pace.Later that afternoon, in another about-turn, Jed Mathre does a stellar job of making a whole room want to punch him in the face. Melanie Godsey’s existential comedy,SponsoredBythe Void, offers a queer awakening through the form of a supernatural visitor. Mathre plays the emotionally illiterate boyfriend to Leah (Kelly Karcher) who is so overburdened by his uselessness that she’s close to bursting. When The Void (Jennifer Ewing) waltzes in, Leah is immediately felled by her hot dom energy and her demand that Leah does exactly what she wants. “Do you eat?” Leah asks her, quivering. “I devour,” The Void replies.Created by Seattle-based company The Co-Conspirators, this goofy, sultry sci-fi horror revels in Leah’s uncompromising newfound confidence, with Kennedy looking on in horror and Leah’s friend Val (Be Russell, funny to her bones) watching with delight as she rejects everything she has previously accepted without resistance. Subservience to men is the real horror here. Eschewing subtleness, the play asks direct questions of how a woman can get trapped into a role she never asked for, and how she can – with support of a sexy, suited-up otherworldly entity – break her way out of it.View image in fullscreenLooping inevitability … David Alnwick’s The Dare Witch Project.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the Guardian“I just want you to know what you’re getting into,” David Alnwick says as he pops his head around the door, checking we’re not actually here for the musical cabaret going on upstairs, before leaping to the side of the stage to fiddle with the video setup. Where a handful of these horror shows use film to enhance the spookiness, Alnwick’sThe Dare Witch Projectis the only one to rely on it. Soldiering through technical issues, our eager host talks us through the footage he supposedly found in an old VHS he got off eBay. The man in the recordings looks surprisingly like him, with his clothes and his voice, and a determination to complete a challenge inspired by the infamous found-footage movie The Blair Witch Project.While most of the tension from this Free Fringe show comes from the screen, as Alnwick presents these clips of the mysterious doppelganger recording himself in the woods, there is a singular, inspired physical magic trick used to beautifully creepy effect. The looping inevitability built into the show mounts tension as we wait, nervously, for what we know is coming, but it takes too long to get there to truly shake any nerves. I find myself wanting to be more scared than I am. Perhaps I’m becoming a horror convert after all.‘Casually jaw-dropping’: at an Edinburgh fringe of tricks and treats, Ben Hart has the magic touchRead moreThe last show of the evening is the least terrifying. Maria Teresa Creasey’s toothless attempt at a vampiric comedy-horror,Degenerate, begins ominously, as the writer-performer lies face-down, bound and gagged, waiting for one of us to untie her. But that’s the end of the innovation. Pitched as experimental, Creasey’s babbling speech acts like a fly being swatted, scattily returning to a smattering of ideas but never settling long enough to offer a performance worth our time.Hazily buzzing around the notion of women being deemed irrelevant as they age, Creasey’s character eventually flits towards the eternal youth of the vampire and lip-syncs to clips of scary movies. She wants to last for ever. I’m glad this performance does not.Elysium is atGilded Balloon at Appleton Toweruntil 24 August; Scatter: A Horror Play is atUnderbelly, Cowgate, until 24 August; Sponsored By the Void is atGreenside @ Riddles Courtuntil 16 August; David Alnwick: The Dare Witch Project is atPBH’s Free Fringe @ Voodoo Roomsuntil 24 August;Degenerateis atPleasance Courtyarduntil 23 AugustExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s in the neighbouring country of Spain, but is nevertheless an icon of this beach.”‘This vertical city is so dense, the only way to build is up’: Victor Cheng’s best phone pictureRead moreIn the foreground of the image is a rock that echoes the shape of the hill, with a stone “placed atop in a way that would seem impossible. Pilgrims pass through this area every day to walk to Santiago de Compostela in Spain, a pilgrimage that covers around 500 miles [805km] and takes about a month to complete. The stone is like a sign, like a small mound pointing as if to say ‘That way’.”Marques says that, since the 1970s, he has developed his own film negatives in a darkroom at his home in Gondomar, just outside central Porto. He thinks this has given him a preference for black-and-white images, no matter how they’re created. In this instance, he used the Hipstamatic app on his iPhone to apply a monochrome filter. “It allows me to better contrast the light and shapes,” Marques says. “Colour can be distracting.

After becoming emblems of Cool Britannia in the mid-1990s they continued to visit their grandmother Margaret Sweeney, until she died in 2000, to socialise in pubs and, in the case of Liam, go for runs and hikes, including up Croagh Patrick, a Catholic pilgrimage site. “It was cloudy, we couldn’t see much, but he loved it,” said Casey, who accompanied the singer up the peak.When either brother entered a pub, word sometimes spread and drew busloads of fans from around the area, said Casey. “It was my first experience of craziness. But mostly we tried to let them be, to not let them be bugged or bothered.”Charlestown mourned when Oasis broke up in 2009 and it celebratedlast year’s announcementof a reunion tour, which moves to Dublin’s Croke Park stadium this Saturday and Sunday. “There were a lot of relieved human beings around here when we heard they were rekindling things,” Casey said.Over the years the Gallaghers were photographed in pubs, and somebody uploaded avideoof Liam joining a traditional music session at his local, JJ Finan’s, but what won over the locals was a low-key normality at odds with the brothers’ hell-raising image in England.“There was no guitar-smashing and they always made time to chat to staff,” said Donal Healy, a marketing manager forIrelandWest airport, also known as Knock, just outside Charlestown.View image in fullscreenLiam Gallagher displays a T-shirt supporting County Mayo’s Gaelic football team during a visit to Ireland West airport at Knock.Photograph: Ireland West airportHealy’s journalist uncle John Healy wrote the book The Death of an Irish Town, also known asNo One Shouted Stop!, that chronicled his native town’s calamitous decline. That decline was part of a wider phenomenon across rural Ireland, but the local and national population has rebounded since the economy took off in the mid-1990s.The title paraphrases an interviewee in the book who said that no part of Irish society stood up to say that mass emigration was not inevitable.The poverty of the 1960s that drove a teenage Peggy Sweeney to seek work in Manchester – where she married another Irish emigrant, Tommy Gallagher – is no more, said Donal Healy. “For Charlestown it’s nearly come full circle, the fact that we have this connection with the family. We’re in the news for the right reason.”View image in fullscreenA mural in Charlestown recalls John Healy’s landmark book No One Shouted Stop!

Radio stations fill their airwaves withOasissongs and speculation about whether the brothers will make a surprise visit to the town. A football team sang Oasis hits in the town square and a cafe put “Oasis soup” on the menu with the tagline “you get a roll with it” – a reference to their 1995 hit.“People are coming to the town just because of the connection,” said Karena Finn, who showed a photograph of Liam with his son during a visit to her family’s pub, Johnny’s Bar, several years ago.View image in fullscreenAnne and Donald, visitors from Scotland, outside Johnny’s Bar in Charlestown.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianA customer named Anne, an emigrant back in Ireland on holiday, lauded the Gallaghers for nourishing their ties to Ireland. “For all the faults they might have,” she said, “they never forgot their roots.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandOasisLiam GallagherNoel GallagherEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It will not tell you exactly how many steps equal a point, but the points you earn can be exchanged for offers such as money off your coffee, sandwiches, or even a packet of smoked salmon at independent cafes and restaurants (mostly) in London.The app has had more than 98,000 downloads and there are now more than 200 Paace partner vendors.The app sets a daily target of 8,000 steps. It took me about a week to earn enough points to get my first reward – an iced latte for £1 and 90 points – a discount on the £3.70 the cafe normally charges. For this, I walked an average of 14,000 steps a day over that period (I was on a city break for part of it), which gave me just under 100 points.To make a purchase, you add the items to your basket and swipe to “unlock” the reward. Be careful: you only have 15 minutes to use the voucher after you have unlocked it, so do not make the mistake I almost made and open it too early.In total, I have saved £15.10 and spent just under 500 Paace points (that is the maximum you can store without upgrading and paying for Paace+ at £29.99 a year, or £4.99 a month).When signing up, you have to share personal information, including your name, email address, and phone number. It is also recommended you share location data so you can see what is available locally. You can turn this off in settings and still search for places near you in the map feature, but some features may not work.View image in fullscreenMabel Banfield-Nwachi saved £15.10 on coffee and other items by earning points on the Paace app.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianJack Blackwell, the owner at Debbie Jo bakery in west London, says Paace has helped increase footfall and attracted new customers to his business. “I liked the idea of getting people moving. For me, that’s always something to encourage,” he says.“But it’s also great for customer acquisition. If someone comes in, you’re hoping that customer is finding out about your cafe and coming back. It’s definitely driven traffic.”The app has also brought a new kind of customer. “Paace definitely brings a younger audience, especially people in their 20s, people who are active,” Blackwell says.He adds that businesses can customise the rewards available “as much as we like”, which can help on days where it tends to be less busy.“On a weekday, if it’s quieter I can shift my offering on Paace, which is great for getting people in,” Blackwell says.SweatcoinYou must be at least 13 to sign up to this app, which rewards your steps with its own digital currency (Sweatcoin) that you can then spend on offers in its in-app marketplace.The marketplace mostly features promotional offers, such as free trials or “just pay postage” deals on anything from discounted protein bars and socks to money off yoga subscriptions and fitness gear, rather than straightforward rewards you can claim without a catch.View image in fullscreenWith Sweatcoin you can earn money off yoga subscriptions and fitness gear.Photograph: Thomas Barwick/Getty ImagesYou can also earn daily rewards (up to 21 coins if you build a streak) for watching adverts.Sweatcoin sets a 12,000 steps-a-day target, a goal I usually failed to reach. And unlike Paace, the rewards are not local or particularly immediate. There is also a whole separate crypto-element – “Sweat”, a token you can earn if you opt into its blockchain-based version of the app. I didn’t.After a month using the app, I was able to get various free trials, including: a week’s supply of magnesium glycinate (though I had to cover the £3.95 postage); free discounts on HelloFresh and Green Chef; a one-month audible free trial for 25 sweatcoins; and 10% off full-priced items at Nike for 130 coins.You can get more if you upgrade to the Premium account for £24.99 a year, or £4.99 a month, which can earn you extra Sweatcoins for your steps. You can also earn daily rewards (up to 21 coins if you build a streak) for watching advertisements.Sweatcoin does not require much from you. Like Paace, it runs in the background, logs your steps and every so often you remember it exists and check how many coins you have got. Whether you will ever actually use them is another matter.Users must input their mobile phone number for verification, and their email address. Sweatcoin says it may also collect data about your contacts, photographs and payment information.BetterPointsThis app rewards active commuting, with points for walking, cycling, taking public transport and, in some cases, recycling or attending exercise classes. You can exchange points for vouchers to use on Amazon, Argos and New Look. You can also choose to donate them to charities including Air Ambulances UK and Cancer Research UK.However, there is a catch: BetterPoints only works properly if the local council or a partner organisation is running a programme in your area. Participating councils include: Newham and Southwark in London; Sheffield; York; Oxfordshire, Leicestershire, and East Dunbartonshire, Wrexham and Deeside.View image in fullscreenThe BetterPoints app allows you to earn points for for recycling if the local council is running a programme in your area.Photograph: Getty ImagesIf you are in an active area, you will earn points for specific activities – such as tracking a walk with GPS (rather than steps), scanning a QR code on a council recycling bin, or checking in at a participating gym. In other parts of the country, you can still track your activity in the app, but you will not earn redeemable points. You may still be able to enter prize draws.You can turn on tracking so it logs your trips automatically, but it is not always accurate. For example, it recorded a cycle on an e-bike as a car journey, and you cannot edit it after the day is done – so it is worth checking regularly if you are trying to earn points. Unfortunately, my borough is not on the scheme, which means all I could do was track my walks without benefiting financially.When signing up, you share your name, email address, year of birth, location, and postcode. You have to allow location tracking, and must be at least 13 years old.What about your dataAll of the apps ask for – and collect – information about you.Dr Maryam Mehrnezhad, a reader in the information security department at Royal Holloway, University of London, says that the tradeoff is simple: you are paying for the app’s free rewards with your personal data.“These companies may use it for various things. For instance, your data – like where you walk and how often – is used for targeted ads. Or when you redeem a reward or a discount from a brand, the app gets paid a commission,” she says.“They can also sell large amounts of potentially anonymised data to other companies. This helps those companies understand big trends.”View image in fullscreenInformation security experts  says users of exercise apps should be wary of how their health and location data is being usedPhotograph: ronstik/AlamyMehrnezhad says users should be wary of how their health and location data is being used.“While apps claim to use anonymised data, it can often be re-identified to reveal sensitive information about your routines, like where you live and work.“This data is highly valuable and can be used to create detailed profiles for targeted advertising or other commercial purposes, and it also creates a risk of a data breach, which could expose your health information and personal locations to hackers,” she adds.Users can limit the data that walking apps collect by managing their phone and in-app settings.“One effective way is to adjust app permissions on their device, such as setting location services to ‘Only While Using the App’ to prevent background tracking,” Mehrnezhad says.However, she notes that this may affect the usability of the app.“You must decide if the benefits are worth these risks. I personally have a problem with any app that wants to know my location at all times,” she says.View image in fullscreenBiscuit is an app for dog owners that lets you earn points by tracking your dog walks and completing ‘wellbeing badges’.Photograph: Gary John Norman/Getty Images/Image SourceThe best of the restOther apps and companies also offer rewards for getting fit and staying healthy. They include:The health insurerVitality, which offers policyholders the chance to earn points when they get active – such as when walking every day or going to the gym. Points unlock weekly and monthly “Active Rewards”. For example, earn 12 activity points in a week and you can choose either a weekly “reward” at Caffè Nero (a free drink or 50% off one, depending on the plan you have), plus 25% off a meal at Itsu; or 50% off an Odeon or Vue cinema ticket. A workout at a participating gym could earn you five points, a 5km parkrun earn you eight. You’ll need to download the app and connect your phone or fitness tracker.The retailerDecathlonlets customers earn points and turn them into vouchers for use online or instore. On top of 10 points for every £1 you spend at the retailer, you can earn 150 points a week by taking part in 150 minutes of sport. This involves logging your sport activity via a connected app such as Strava, Garmin or Kiprun. You can also earn points by sharing product reviews on items you have bought. For 2,000 points, you get a £3 Decathlon voucher, while 6,000 gets you a £10 voucher.Biscuitis an app for dog owners that lets you earn points – called Biscuits – by tracking your dog walks and completing “wellbeing badges” (for preventative care such as flea and worm treatments and vaccinations) and challenges. You redeem your points for vouchers at brands such as Costa Coffee, Tesco, Amazon and Nando’s. The basic version of the app is free, but the paid-for version (from £3.99 a month) “unlocks 5x faster Biscuit earning”. A spokesperson says a user of the paid-for version can earn enough points for a coffee “in as little as 23 days” by tracking their walks.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsWalkingAppsHealth & wellbeingFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We were sitting on his leafy balcony in Sydney. His expression was grave, his skin pale – nothing like his usual relaxed, smiley self. He’d been hiding something from me and he’d finally decided to confess.My thoughts raced.He’s married. He has a kid. He’s moving to a small island in the South Pacific.“I have a pet,” he blurted out.I blinked.He rubbed his palms together nervously, then disappeared into his bedroom. I waited, beginning to guess where this was going. He reemerged clutching a writhing snake.Brent had been hiding his pet python from me because he was terrified it would be a dealbreaker. It wasn’t, I actually love snakes – although if it had been a tarantula, this story might have had a different ending.View image in fullscreenNatalie and Brent in 2009 in the early days of their relationship.We had met at my work Christmas party only a few weeks earlier. He was invited as a guest from another company and was busily chatting with a friend of mine whom he already knew. I stood on the sidelines and stared at his face. So handsome. Then, his eyes flickered to mine and held my gaze, and something quietly stirred within me. The shift was subtle, but it was unmistakably there.After my colleague drifted away, Brent and I started talking. We couldn’t stop. Noticing his accent, I made the rookie mistake of asking him (a Canadian) where he was from in the US. He didn’t mind at all.There wasn’t much that bothered him. He was gentle, patient, kind – and irresistibly intelligent.We swapped numbers and for our first date, he took me to a buzzy Thai restaurant beside the Sydney Harbour Bridge. We talked so much our jaws ached. I still couldn’t quite tear my eyes off him.Things moved fast. There were weekend drives in his cool vintage car, staying up all night babysitting wide-eyed puppies, countless red carpet events I dragged him to because I was working as an entertainment reporter, and more of that endless, joyful talking. He told me he believed that if we’d met when we were little kids, he would have wanted to be my best friend. I told him I could be locked in a jail cell with him for the rest of my life and never get bored. He was utterly fascinating to me. Still is.View image in fullscreenBrent and Natalie on their wedding day in 2013.Not long after the snake reveal, my ex-boyfriend contacted me out of the blue asking if we could do a video call. When he and I broke up, it hit me pretty hard. Even though I was just about to leave to go to Brent’s place, my ex said he had something to tell me. Apparently, those words are my relationship anthem.Somehow, though, I knew this wasn’t going to be about a pet.Through the screen, my ex revealed he’d cheated on me while we were together. Not once, not twice – but about 20 times. He’d come to realise he had some problems he needed to work out and part of that involved telling me the truth. And I do commend him for that. It can’t have been easy.But at that moment, I felt as though I’d been punched in the chest. I was sick with hurt and humiliation. All the signs I had missed began flashing up in vivid detail.I thought I’d be fine by the time I got to Brent’s; after all, my ex and I had been over for a while. But the grief and sense of betrayal wouldn’t let me go. I walked into the apartment, sat down on the couch, and broke down in tears. I couldn’t stop.I was so embarrassed – and horrified for Brent. This was supposed to be our honeymoon phase. Why was I crying over someone else? I tried to hide my face.He asked me what was wrong and I told him everything. I braced for confusion, jealousy, maybe even a fight. Brent had every right to question why I was so upset about another guy.Instead, he reached for my hands and looked straight into my eyes, his brow furrowed. He looked heartbroken – but not for himself.The moment I knew: through tears, I confessed I didn’t know how I was supposed to leave himRead more“I amsosorry,” he said. “That must have been really awful to hear.” Then, he pulled me into a tight hug, his palm stroking my back. He never once made it about him. His concern was all for me.That was when I knew what a good man looked like, and that I had fallen in love.Seventeen years later, we’re still together. We’ve lived overseas for 10 of those years, been married for 12, and have two amazing children – plus the slightly alarming reptile who has been with us all along.Brent is still my favourite person to talk to. With him, I’ve found a kind of safety and comfort that I hope lasts a lifetime.Natalie Murray is the author ofLights, Camera, Love(Allen & Unwin; $22.99)Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Others, such as this one, are more challenging. But imagine this: seared aubergines cooked with sweet onions and tomatoes, spiced with aromatics such as cardamom, chilli, mustard seeds and smoky curry leaves, then melted into a pot with rice, water and time, until wetter than a risotto but less homogeneous than a congee. A perfect meal to cook on a cool summer’s evening to slow yourself down, both to stoke an appetite and to warm the belly.Brothy and spiced aubergine and tomato riceFresh curry leaves are now sold in most large supermarkets, so never settle for dried ones. Box or wrap any you don’t use and freeze for another time; much the same applies to green finger chillies, too.Prep15 minCook1 hrServes49 tbsp rapeseed oil2 medium aubergines(600g), cut into 3cm x 3cm dice2 tsp fine sea salt2 red onions, peeled and thinly sliced30 fresh curry leaves2 green cardamom pods, lightly bashed5 garlic cloves, peeled and minced360g cherry tomatoes, halved250g arborio rice1 tsp black mustard seeds2 green finger chillies, stalks discarded, the rest finely choppedPour three tablespoons of the oil into your widest nonstick frying pan and set it on a high heat. When the oil is very hot, add half the aubergines, sprinkle over a quarter-teaspoon of salt and cook, stirring often, for about eight minutes, until browned on the outside and nearly cooked through (ie, not completely soft). Transfer to a large plate, add another three tablespoons of oil to the pan and repeat with the second batch of aubergines and another quarter-teaspoon of salt.Heat a tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan and, once it’s hot, add the onions, half the curry leaves, all the crushed cardamom and a teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until soft, then add the garlic and cook for two minutes more.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Put the fried aubergines and the onion mix in a large pot (keep the frying pan for later), add the halved tomatoes and cook on a medium heat for four minutes, until they’re starting to soften. Measure a litre of water into a jug or pan and have it ready by the side of the stove. Add the rice and the final half-teaspoon of salt to the aubergine mix, stir in a third of the water, then leave it to bubble away on a medium heat for about eight minutes, until the rice has soaked up the liquid. Add another third of the water, cook for another eight minutes, so the rice sucks that up, too, then add the final slug of water and cook for a final five minutes – the rice should be soupy.Put two tablespoons of oil in the frying pan on a medium heat and, when it’s very hot, add the mustard seeds, chillies and remaining curry leaves. Cook for two minutes, pour all over the rice and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegan food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkRiceTomatoesSri Lankan food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Packed into the space in front of the 62-year-old’s small stage, and spilling out on to the wooden bleachers above, hundreds of people have gathered to hear Granny Wang – real name Zhao Mei – play matchmaker to young men and women at a daily show in a theme park in Kaifeng, an ancient city in central China’s Henan province.One man who volunteers to be set up comes on stage and tells Zhao that a previous relationship broke down due to a lack of time. “Well, now that you’ve met your ideal partner here, you’ll have the time,” she assures him, and the crowd cheers.View image in fullscreenHundreds of people gather to watch Zhao Mei’s show at a Henan theme park.Photograph: Gilles Sabrié/The GuardianZhao has played the character of Granny Wang for eight years and introduced the matchmaking element of her show in 2023 – which brought her viral fame. Last year she went from having a few hundred thousand followers on Douyin, a Chinese social media app similar to TikTok, to more than 7 million, and has been called “China’sCilla Black”, a reference to the late host of the British TV show Blind Date. But with some audience members arriving several hours early and enduring the mid-August heat to grab a front-row spot for the raucous and somewhat camp performance, Zhao could just as well be Henan’s Madonna.Most of the people in the audience are families looking for a way to entertain their children during the school holidays. But it seems that about one in five of them are looking for love. “I just do not want to stay single,” said Wang Mengjia, 18, after an unsuccessful spin on Zhao’s stage.View image in fullscreenWhat’s your name and where do you come from? Granny Wang has been called ‘China’s Cilla Black’.Photograph: Gilles Sabrié/The GuardianZhao has revived the character of the village matchmaker, a role that is going out of fashion now that many people meet online, through friends – or, increasingly, not at all. While there is a growing “love industry” of matchmaking services fromlocal governmentsand commercial enterprises alike, would-be cupids face an uphill battle in China’s cities where the marriage market is increasingly being shunned altogether.Despite Zhao’s packed shows, China’s marriage rates have plummeted to record lows, a trend that is increasingly treated as a national crisis. Last year, the number of registered marriages dropped by a record 20%, falling to just over 6m, down from 7.7m in 2023. Compared with a decade earlier, the number of couples tying the knot each year has halved.The trend is particularly apparent among urban, educated women. More than 40% of urban 25- to 29-year-olds have never married, up from 9% in 2000, according to analysis fromWang Feng, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine.Some of this is because of China’s ageing population. Decades of the one-child policy, which was scrapped in 2016, forced thepopulation into decline, meaning that the pool of people of marrying age has been shrinking.View image in fullscreen‘Women are increasingly disappointed with men these days,’ said Hao Jingyi, 19, standing in front of the balcony, who came to Granny Wang’s show with her mother, standing on the balcony.Photograph: Gilles Sabrié/The GuardianBut, analysts say, demographics alone don’t explain the trend.“The deeper change is in attitudes,” saidLijia Zhang, a writer who is working on a book about marriage in China. “In the past, when the country was poor, marriage was an economic necessity … Now it’s about personal happiness, more than anything else, not filial duty or social obligation. Many urban, educated women no longer see marriage or motherhood as essential to a fulfilling life.”Hao Jingyi, 19, agrees. “If I don’t meet someone suitable, I would enjoy more freedom and comfort living alone … women are increasingly disappointed with men these days,” she said, as she waited for Zhao’s show to start.The Chinese government hopes to change her mind. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has called on women to “actively cultivate a new culture of marriageand childbearing” and has promoted a more traditional, patriarchal type of politics.View image in fullscreenGranny Wang tries to make a match – but despite enthusiasm for her show, China’s marriage rates have plummeted.Photograph: Gilles Sabrié/The GuardianChina’s leadership is ideologically opposed to singledom and officials have a practical concern: falling birthrates. Even people who do couple up are increasingly rejecting parenthood, as young people – women in particular – worry that childrearing is too expensive and competitive. Last year China’s birthrate was just 6.77 births per 1,000 people, a slight increase on2023’s record lowof 6.39 but still dramatically lower than the figure from a decade ago.The Chinese authorities have introduced a slew of policies at national and local levels to encourage marriage and childbirth. This year the government rolled out an annual childcare subsidy of 3,600 yuan (£370) until the age of three and several provinces offer bonuses orextra holiday daysfor newlyweds. But many women feel it is not enough.Practicalities aside, there are other factors driving these trends. In July, the Chinese internet was briefly abuzz with the news of chat groups on the encrypted messaging app Telegram which, according to Chinese media reports, contained tens of thousands of Chinese men who shared pornographic pictures and videos of women, often taken without their consent, in the “MaskPark tree hole forum”.Women were outraged, with many feeling that the authorities did not do enough to protect them from sexual harassment.View image in fullscreenThe trend not to marry is particularly apparent among young urban, educated women – despite Granny Wang’s best efforts.Photograph: Gilles Sabrié/The GuardianViolet Du Feng, a Chinese film-maker whose latest documentary, The Dating Game, follows men enrolled in a dating camp, said there was an increasing ideological gap between the sexes. She said the imbalance created by the one-child policy – there are now more than 30 million more men than women in China – had led to “dissatisfaction about gender equality”.But while feminist activism used to be quietly tolerated, in the past decade the Chinese Communist party has cracked down on civil society, and the space to protest against issues such as sexual harassment has virtually disappeared. “Typically, in a more democratic society, you can point your finger at power,” Feng said, “but in China, you cannot.” So, “people are just pointing their fingers at each other. That creates even more extreme hostility between men and women.”Feng noted that when she was born in 1979, her mother had access to full-time, free childcare before she was two months old. When Feng had her own daughter in 2014, “there was nothing”.View image in fullscreenZhang Hongqian, 24, left, persuaded her brother, Hongguang, 21, right, to rent costumes for Granny Wang’s event; they are standing by a wall where people write their phone numbers looking for dates.Photograph: Gilles Sabrié/The GuardianIt’s not just women who are tired of the pressure to marry. Zhang Hongguang, 21, from Shandong province, attended Zhao’s event with his sister, who had persuaded him to join her in renting fancy-dress costumes for the outing. But the next day he had to return to his home town to grudgingly attend a blind date arranged by their parents, who had paid a matchmaker to set him up with someone. “I don’t like it, but it was the only way my parents had,” he said, adding that he preferred to just stay at home with his cat.His sister, Zhang Hongqian, a 24-year-old pilates teacher, had also been forced on several unsuccessful blind dates by their parents. “I’m not in a rush to find a partner,” she said. “If I can avoid getting married, I’ll choose not to get married.”Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaDatingMarriageSocial mediaWomenAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To qualify, you or your partner need to receive one of a list of benefits. These include housing benefit, income-based jobseeker’s allowance and pension credit.To get the discount, you also need your, or your partner’s, name to be on the bill.In England and Wales, the energy companies will automatically match people’s eligibility using their customer records from 24 August. In Scotland, the discount will automatically go to people who get pension credit guarantee and are named on their electricity bill. They will need to apply to their provider from October if on other qualifying benefits.It is not too late to get the discount after next Sunday, but you will need to wait for a letter to apply.Eligible customers on prepayment meters, who use a key or card to top up, should also ensure their household’s account is registered in their name.The government has expanded eligibility to the warm home discount this year, and it says that, as a result, 6 million households will receive the discount this winter – an increase of 2.7 million on last year.The minister for energy consumers Miatta Fahnbulleh, says:“If you know someone who might be eligible, please start spreading the word to family and friends, encouraging them to check they are named on their energy bill.”View image in fullscreenAs energy prices increase it is more important than ever to get an automatic price cut.Photograph: Tolga Akmen/EPARichard Neudegg, the director of regulation at the price comparison website Uswitch, says the discount could be “a lifeline for vulnerable customers”. He adds: “Anyone struggling to pay their bills should contact their supplier, who may be able to offer help or support.”This year the government has alsoreversed the movethat took the winter fuel payment from all but the poorest pensioners. As a result, about nine million pensioners will get the allowance of up to £300, which will be paid to everyone who receives the state pension. Those with an income of£35,000 or more will have theirs clawed back through tax.Scammers have been taking advantage of confusion over the paymentsto target vulnerable people. Fraudulent messages are sent to people saying they need to register for this year’s “winter heating allowance”, and asking them to follow a link and submit personal details.The Department for Work and Pensions says it never texts people to ask for their information.The energy price cap is likely to change at the start of October, with analysts recently predicting that it will fall from itscurrent level of £1,720 a year for a typical household.Explore more on these topicsHousehold billsConsumer affairsEnergy billsBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

All photographs: Leon Foggitt/The GuardianCamping holidaysWild camping the easy way: how a secret Exmoor trip pleased everyone – including the farmerWith the help of an adventure platform that connects campers with landowners, we have a remote corner of Exmoor all to ourselves for the nightJohn HarrisSat 16 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareYou can find it on Spotify in playlists for insomniacs, but on a Friday afternoon on Exmoor, we are happily listening to the real thing: the gorgeous ambient sound made by grasshoppers, birds and the buzzing insects that momentarily fly in and out of earshot.The view is just as serene: the deep-blue Bristol Channel in the middle distance, golden fields just in front of us and, in our immediate surroundings, huge expanses of grasses and wildflowers. Our tent is pitched between two strips of woodland, which provide just enough shade. To complete the sense of calm wonderment: for 24 hours, we have this piece of land completely to ourselves.Essentially, we are wild camping, but in a reassuringly managed way. Our spot has been arranged byCampWild, an adventure outfit that started in 2023and has about 200 approved locations on its books.View image in fullscreenA few days before setting off, we are sent our first “route card”, complete with a map, a few warnings (“there is a high risk of midges and ticks in this area”), and the promise of “a sheltered meadow-woodland space ideal for roaming”. Then comes the start of this long weekend: just after lunchtime, I set out on a three-mile walk from a nearby car park with my son James, 18, and daughter Rosa, 16, arriving at our destination in the late afternoon in searing heat. We have made sure to bring three vital litres of water. Once our tent is pitched and the evening’s relative cool arrives, what we half expect materialises: a lovely feeling of time ceasing to matter, which runs through an evening spent eating dinner (the obligatory instant pasta), aimlessly rambling around our surroundings, then marvelling at a sky much starrier than any to be seen in a town or city.View image in fullscreenWaiting for dinner … John with Rosa and JamesOne of CampWild’s rules is that locations must be kept secret, in case word gets out and they are overrun with unauthorised campers. This much I can say: the land we are staying on is part of a regenerative farm that claims to produce 167 varieties of food, and whose proprietors are enthusiastic rewilders and tree-planters. Its co-owner, Kate Hughes, tells me she welcomes campers because “if we don’t have people on the land, they won’t fight for nature: we have to have a relationship as a nation with the natural world that supports us”.For many people, spending a night or two this way can seem daunting: CampWild aims to give them a bit of guidance and hand-holdingOur somewhat limited knowledge of bird calls suggests that we are in the company of wood pigeons, one or two sparrowhawks and an abundance of blackbirds. We are half hoping to see a deer or two, but although none materialise, it hardly matters – this feels like somewhere teeming with life.Somewhat inevitably, James and Rosa spend time on their phones, but we soon agree on a compromise: 90 minutes spent listening on a Bluetooth speaker to suitably pastoral music – Nick Drake, Fairport Convention, the acoustic demos for the Beatles’ White Album – before a final hour of stillness and silence, when we begin to drift off to sleep. James has always been much better suited to staying outdoors than in (his first recorded lie-in happened on a Dorset campsite when he was five). So it proves tonight. By 11pm, he is slumbering, while Rosa and I stay awake for another half hour.View image in fullscreenCamping con fusilliCampWild was founded by Alex Clasper and Tom Backhouse, thirtysomething dads whose lifelong passion for the outdoor life was ignited on camping trips arranged by their Devon comprehensive school. Several years after they first met, Backhouse’s sister was involved in a serious car accident, which led him to do a sponsored trek around all of the UK’s national parks to raise money for the air ambulance service that rescued her.Clasper accompanied him on some of these adventures, which involved a good deal of wild camping and sparked a revelation. “Escaping, getting off grid and spending time in nature was almost like therapy,” Clasper tells me, a few days before I set off. “Sitting under the stars for the evening – that’s where we’ve had some of our deepest and most important conversations.”View image in fullscreenSome happy aimless rambling …For many people, spending a night or two this way can seem daunting:CampWild’s essential modus operandi, Clasper says, is to “give them the confidence and knowledge and knowhow: a bit of guidance and hand-holding”. And what they offer has chimed with the zeitgeist in two ways. Over the past two and a half years, awareness of wild camping has rocketed, thanks partly to the legal tussle between the Dartmoor landowner Alexander Darwall and Right to Roam activists,which was finally settled– in the latter’s favour – by the supreme court in May.At the same time, the collective yearning for nature, manifested in a deluge of books about hares, footpaths and rivers, has surely accelerated CampWild’s growth. It now has about 4,000 members, who pay a £25 annual fee – £1 of which goes to the environmental charityRewilding Britain– and are charged about £15 per stay, with fees going to the landowner.As we drive home, I can feel the meditative calm the weekend brought me still lingeringAnother rule, aimed at gently enforcing meticulous standards on litter and mess, is that campers must take a before-and-after photo of their spot, and mail it to CampWild within 24 hours. But one question, Clasper tells me, always comes up: what to do about the most basic human functions? Poos must be bagged up and disposed of elsewhere: “There are a couple of spaces that do allow, er …digging, but most don’t fall into that category.” By way of highlighting roughly how to do it, CampWild has a sponsorship agreement with a brand calledDicky Bag, which offers reusable receptacles – usually marketed at dog-owners – with “odour proof seams and seals”. Free weeing, needless to say, is allowed, providing it is done well away from what Clasper calls “water sources”.View image in fullscreenHome from home … Rosa making campBack in our field, we wake after 7am, and slowly make our way into a morning gripped by more heat. The route back to the car, along a mixture of tree-lined roads and field paths, passes through the Somerset village of Roadwater, where we are offered a lovely kind of respite. Every other month, there is a community breakfast in the village hall, and a meal for the three of us costs little more than £20. We split the afternoon between the village of Porlock and tourist-filled Lynmouth and Lynton, before the temperature begins to ease. We then set off on a 20-minute drive along isolated Exmoor roads, during which a huge deer vaults on to the tarmac 10 metres in front of us and then disappears into the countryside beyond.This evening’s sleeping spot is stunning. In an area reportedly popular with people walking from Land’s End to John o’Groats, it lies half a mile or so beyond a huge campsite whose residents enjoy snooker-table lawns. Our chosen spot, by contrast, is the knobbly ground in a steep-sided stretch of the Exe valley, directly under a pyramid-shaped hill. The river is right next to us: six or seven metres wide, scattered with pebbled islands. The night sky is particularly vivid: James once again falls asleep almost instantly, while Rosa and I manoeuvre our heads next to the tent door and stare up, half-convinced we might be in the presence of UFOs, before we realise they are – obviously – distant planes, presumably en route to Bristol airport.As we drive home, I can feel the meditative calm the weekend brought me still lingering, along with the sense that this bucolic version of Airbnb is going to become even more popular. “We want to get 1 million people across the UK out into these spaces, experiencing nature and slowing down,” Clasper tells me. I slightly worry that those imagined multitudes might get in the way of all that gorgeous quiet, but it might just happen.Annual membership ofCampWildis £25Explore more on these topicsCamping holidaysSomerset holidaysWalking holidaysFamily holidaysEngland holidaysDevon holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If only I knew how to play it …Tim DowlingSat 16 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 16.36 EDTShareI’m in a recording studio with two other members of the band I’m in, listening to stuff we’ve recorded, with an eye toward finishing touches. But really it’s a last chance to fix mistakes: ropey backing vocals; mistimed bass notes; a banjo part played with an out‑of-tune B string.“I can easily redo it,” I say, thinking: I don’t even remember playing it in the first place.“You only hit that string a couple of times,” says George, the engineer. “I can probably edit it.”“As always, I prefer solutions that don’t involve me doing anything,” I say.The guitarist, meanwhile, is compiling a list of potential album titles. Whenever he comes up with one, he hands me his notepad and insists I add one of my own.“Don’t ask me to explain my thinking,” I say, handing it back.“There are no bad ideas at this stage,” he says.George loads another song. It begins gently, with guitar and vocals, building across the second verse and first chorus to a swelling instrumental interlude. Then it drops down again.“I think it needs something else coming in there,” I say.“I agree,” says George.“Something different, maybe a bit nautical,” says the guitar player.“Ship’s harmonium?” I say, feeling clever.“That sort of thing,” says the guitar player.“OK,” says George. “Let’s mike up the harmonium.”“Shit,” I say. “I forgot you had one.”“Good luck,” says the guitar player.I don’t know if the studio’s old harmonium has been on a ship, but it looks the part. Two big foot pedals operate the bellows that push the air across the reeds, and they creak when you step on them. I recall trying to play this instrument once before, years ago. I also recall we didn’t use any of it, because it sounded terrible.“Don’t touch any of the knobs,” says George through my headphones. “It barely works as it is.”“I won’t,” I say.The first take is a disaster. I forget what key the song is in. I can see everyone laughing through the glassThe first take is disastrous. I forget what key the song is in. By the time I chance upon the correct answer – D major – the eight bars are over.When I finish I can see everyone laughing through the glass, but George graciously does not press the switch that would allow me to hear it until they’ve stopped.“A few mistakes,” he says.“I’m not a recognised harmonium player,” I say.“This is gonna work!” says the guitar player.“It can only get better,” says George. “I’ll drop you in the same place.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But if I pump faster than the song it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to keep time.“How did they do this on ships?” I say.“Would it help,” says the fiddle player, “if I did the pedals for you?”“I don’t know,” I say. “Maybe.”The fiddle player barges me over on the bench, plugging in a second pair of headphones.“Don’t listen to the song,” I say. “It makes it worse.” He takes the headphones off.“Two bars and in,” says George.Tim Dowling: the old dog snorted with delight – and then she was gone | Tim DowlingRead moreAt my signal, the fiddle player begins to pump furiously. In my headphones it sounds like someone climbing the stairs in a haunted house. But when I press the keys, the notes come through loud and bright. As we progress, it gets louder. And louder. I think: he’s over-pumping! I stop before the end.“Sorry,” I say. “I thought the harmonium was going to explode.”“Ha ha!” says the fiddle player.We do eight further takes in three‑legged-race fashion: one pedalling, one playing, the harmonium slipping up and down in volume, and the fiddle player laughing out loud whenever I make a mistake. In the end, George glues the front half of one take to the back half of another, and we have a part.As this sleight of hand is taking place, our trumpet player walks in.“Hey,” she says. “How’s it going?”“Just, you know, adding harmonium to everything,” I say. The guitar player hands her his list.“Album titles,” he says. “Read and add.” She scans the list in silence.“We’re still at the no-bad-ideas stage,” I say.“Evidently,” she says.Explore more on these topicsMusicThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Small tortoiseshells forage among the yellow radiating petals ofInula hookeri. Speckled wood and comma land beside them, two at once sharing a flower. Apeacockflicks its large wings open and shut, each time revealing false eyes and sleek hairy body.It’s a relief to see so many familiar butterflies feeding on familiar flowers. This time last year was very different. Then,I wrote in my Country Diaryabout their absence, despite the abundance of nectar plants here – the effect of a cold, wet winter and spring. When the results came in from the Big Butterfly Count (BBC), Butterfly Conservation declareda butterfly emergency.What a contrast this year. The initial results of the 2025 BBC have confirmed what so many of us suspected: that we are seeing butterflies more frequently and in greater numbers this summer than last, helped by the warm, dry spring. White butterflies, large and small, so far top the chart – full results are at the end of August – followed by gatekeeper, red admiral and meadow brown.View image in fullscreenA painted lady glows orange, bathed in reflected light.Photograph: Susie WhiteWhat I’m seeing in my own garden echoes this. High numbers of large whites and green-veined whites flying around our veg. Meadow browns and small heaths on the purple-pink marjoram alongside numerous bumblebees and honeybees. Speckled wood and comma – two species that are gradually moving north – are plentiful.So much beauty too. The underwings of a painted lady glow orange, bathed in the reflected light of calendula petals. Daytime moths are also frequent.Large yellow underwingsanddark archeson sea holly, the occasional thrill of ahummingbird hawk-moth– but not yet the more southern-basedJersey tiger, whose numbers, according to the initial BBC results, have soared this year.There’s a wonderful sense of continuity at seeing the butterflies of my childhood, and similar in number (at least to my memory) of summers past. This year’s profusion doesn’t, of course, reverse their long-term decline, but it does feel more hopeful. Sitting here, watching the constant movement, I realise what easy joy butterflies bring – and how much I missed them last year.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsButterfliesCountry diaryRural affairsInsectsWildlifeAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can see the hills of northSomerset, Bath and Wales, and almost peer into Bristol City FC’s Ashton Gate stadium.The platform the Guardian reached was about 100 metres (330ft) above the river close to the tower on the west side of the bridge that bears the mottosuspensa vix via fit– a suspended bridge built with difficulty.Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s stucture may have been built with difficulty but it has stood the test of time and still has 99% of its original ironwork. “It’s not likeTrigger’s broom,” said Johnson, alluding to the road sweeper’s brush – which had 17 new heads and 14 new handles – in the sitcom Only Fools and Horses.View image in fullscreenAs the River Avon is tidal, the salty air means the bridge’s ironwork can corrode easily if not well-maintained.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThe bridge was opened in 1864 – but the links are even older as they were recycled from the engineer’soriginal Hungerford footbridgein London when it was demolished.Therefurbishment workon the grade I Clifton Suspension Bridge began in April last year and should be finished by next spring. It isbeing carried outby the engineering contractor Taziker, which has previously worked on Abraham Darby’s Iron Bridge in Shropshire and Brunel’s Royal Albert Bridge, which links Devon and Cornwall. Taziker is alsorefurbishing Brunel’s intricateironwork on the roofof Bristol Temple Meads station.The flake-grey paint has to be applied painstakingly by hand because it is difficult to get the right thickness in the nooks and crannies with a spray. Specially made brushes designed for the Clifton chains have been created.As the River Avon is tidal, the salty air means the ironwork can corrode easily if it is not well maintained. Three coats of even coverage are required. Another reason for not spraying is that drips and flecks must not find their way into the gorge, a site of special scientific interest.View image in fullscreenThe bridge’s motto,suspensa vix via fit, is engraved on the tower on the west side.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianAbout 8,000 litres (1,760 gallons) of paint will be used and it will take 100,000 person-hours to complete the job. The project is costing £8m and is funded through the tolls collected by the Clifton Suspension Bridge Trust charity, which maintains the bridge.Natalie Craig, the learning officer at the bridge, said workers of eras gone by would be amazed at the effort, especially the health and safety measures in place now.“Way back then, they would balance on the chains to go up,” she said. “One of the things they would be asked when they went for a job is if they could walk up the chains. They wouldn’t be able to comprehend all the measures we have today but they’d be proud of how it is being looked after.

The family would be taking some time to settle in before speaking about their experience, she added.Shaw, 33, who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, was detained with her son when they attempted to re-enter the US after dropping her two eldest children at Vancouver airport on 24 July, so they could fly toNew Zealandfor a holiday with their grandparents.Shaw’s father, Rod Price, toldRadio New Zealand: “She went to go back across into the US and then I got a frantic call to say that she’s being detained and ‘they’re about to take my phone off me’ and ‘they’re locking me up for the night’.”.Besancon, who had helped to raise money for Shaw’s legal fight, said it had been a “terrifying” and “barbaric” ordeal for her friend.“Sarah thought she was being kidnapped,”Besancon told the Guardianthis week. “They didn’t really explain anything to her at first, they just kind of quietly took her and her son and immediately put them in like an unmarked white van.”Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) confiscated Shaw’s phone and transported the mother and son to the Dilley immigration processing center in south Texas, many states away from her home, Besancon said. Foreign nationals caught up in the Trump administration’simmigration crackdownhavesimilarly been transportedto centres far from their homes, support networks and legal representation.An Ice spokesperson said: “The Dilley detention center is retrofitted for families. Adults with children are housed in facilities that provide for their safety, security and medical needs.” They added that “parents, who are here illegally, can take control of their departure” by self-deporting through a government-issued app.Shaw is on a “combo card” visa, made up of an employment visa, which she obtained through her employment at a maximum security juvenile facility, and an I-360 visa, which can grant immigration status to domestic violence survivors.Father of New Zealand woman held in US by Ice along with six-year-old son voices hope for releaseRead moreShaw had recently received a letter confirming her visa renewal, not realising that the I-360 element of her visa was still pending approval.“It wasn’t until she tried to come back across the border that she realised only half of the combination card – because it’s only one physical card – had been fully approved,” said Besancon.“It has been absolutely horrible,” Besancon said, adding that aside from the staff, Shaw and her son were the only English speakers. She said they were locked in their shared bedroom from 8pm to 8am and not allowed to wear their own clothes.A spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said: “When someone with an expired parole leaves the country and tries to re-enter the US, they will be stopped in compliance with our laws and regulations. If they are accompanied by a minor, CBP will follow all protocols to keep families together or arrange care with a legal guardian. Immigration law will be enforced, and our officers and agents will act accordingly.”Shaw’s case is the latest in a growing list of foreigners facing interrogation, detention and deportations at the US border, including aBritish tourist, three GermansLucas Sielaff,Fabian Schmidt and Jessica Brösche,and aCanadianand anAustralianwho were each held and then deported, despite having valid work visas.The union representing Shaw, theWashington Federation of State Employees, had called for her release.“The trauma this has already caused for her and her son may never be healed,” said Mike Yestramski, the union’s president and a psychiatric social worker at Western State hospital.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandUS immigrationAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Some MPs received more than 100 within 48 hours from the same address.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailOne of the emails reads: “A message to the Liberal Party and Nationals: Net Zero is causing irreversible damage to our nation. Our economic health is declining … immediate action is required. Dump Net Zero policies now, or we will stop supporting your agenda.”Another reads: “Net Zero is a dangerous joke. It’s time to dump it, or we’ll dump you.”The email sender appears to be Whitestone Strategic but the email address is listed as CiviClick – a US-based platform that describes itself as AI-Powered grassroots advocacy software, that allows users to “reach elected officials with powerful policy messages”.A Guardian Australia investigation in October revealed Whitestone Strategic’sclose ties to Advance, the rightwing advocacy group behind the main organisation promoting a no vote in the Indigenous voice referendum, Fair Australia.A separate investigation also found Whitestone Strategic billed taxpayers almost $135,000 over two yearsfor work providing media messaging for conservative politicians during the voice to parliament campaign. Whitestone Strategic’s work for Coalition members has extended beyond the voice campaign.View image in fullscreenEmails sent to Liberal MPs that appear to be sent from Whitestone Strategic.None of the emails, sent since Monday, are addressed directly to the politician, or signed off by a member of the public. Many of the dozens of emails received by MPs contain the same message and some contain what appears to be coding left in unintentionally.Advance announced on 8 August it would launch a campaign targeting “weakling” Liberals, by pressuring them to drop their support for net zero by 2050. On 15 August, it said its supporters had sent 19,897 emails to coalition MPs and senators.Several members who received the emails expressed frustration over the tactic.One Liberal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they received at least 50 emails in 24 hours, none directly addressed to them.“The policy review process is important, we must take the time to do it right,” they said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This MP, who said they were previously supportive of Whitestone’s work, said “Why can’t Whitestone get this stuff right?”.Liberal Senator for South Australia, Andrew McLachlan, a vocal supporter of net zero and climate action, confirmed he’d received dozens of emails from Whitestone Strategic over the last 48 hours.He said maintaining emissions reduction targets is critical and said he would continue to advocate for the target.“It is not ‘weakness’ to support targets to reduce pollution. You are not a ‘weakling’ to be committed to exploring every possible solution to respond to our changing climate,” he said.TheLiberal partyis reviewing its energy policies, led by the shadow energy minister, Dan Tehan.The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, hasn’t committed to keeping net zero, but some vocal members of the Coalition – including Barnaby Joyce, Michael McCormack, Matt Canavan and Tony Pasin – have been publicly and privately lobbying against the target.In response to questions from Guardian Australia, Advance said they wouldn’t comment on individual emails from supporters, but that “it is no secret that we are campaigning against net zero and have asked our supporters to contact MPs to voice their opposition”.Explore more on these topicsCoalitionAustralian politicsLiberal partyNational partyGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

So what can be done to boost reading?Sign up for The Crunch email newsletterSat 16 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 21.55 EDTShareThe demise of men reading books has,once again, been greatly exaggerated.Arecent ABC articleabout Australians’ reading habits claimed “Australians, especially men, are reading less than ever before” and “the data showed females, on average, were reading more than males across all age groups”.This coverage was picked up byan opinion piece in the Age, with the headline “Young men have stopped reading books – and these are the reasons why”, which also said “the percentage of men who would pick up any book at all is very small”.So have men actually stopped reading? Has there been a decline in reading overall? And how do reading rates compare between males and females?The ABC and the Age articles were largely based on figures fromthe ABS Time Use Survey– the proportion of people, by age group, who participated in reading in a two-day period in 2020-21:Participation in reading by sexThe main thing is the little black lines – the “confidence interval” – a statistical measure of uncertainty that can be used when showing the average value of data from a survey (or other type of research).And what this means, which I have confirmed with the ABS, is that the reading rates are statistically the same for males and females within all generations with the exception of gen X.Equally fraught is claiming that reading has declined from this data as reading habits may differ by stage of life – perhaps people read more as they get older.The higher reading rates for older cohorts are likely affected by the survey methods, too – counting reading of a physical newspaper, but not reading of news online (“general internet and device use”).All of that said, we do know from other research that therehasbeen a decline in reading rates, and that females do read more than males generally – though the difference is usually only somewhere about 7% to 11%.However, different surveys measure different things, in different ways, which makes it tricky to compare them.For example, theNational Arts Participation Survey(Naps) measures any reading at all in the past 12 months and only counts reading as including “novels, poetry, creative nonfiction and short stories”.In this data, younger people surveyed had ahigherreading participation rate than several of the older demographics – the opposite of what we see in the ABS Time Use Survey.So what can we say about declining reading rates?Figures on this were surprisingly hard to find, however, thanks to the researchers at the University of Melbourne, I can share figures from theHilda survey(which to the best of my knowledge haven’t been published until now!).In 2012, 2016 and 2020 people were asked how frequently they read either books or magazines and newspapers in the past 12 months. The gist is that they’re reading books less frequently, and increasingly not at all:People are reading books less frequently, or increasingly not at allSplitting the data by gender shows the decline has been consistent for males and females surveyed, and the gap in reading rates for males and females is consistent with other surveys:Reading books has declined in Australia, regardless of genderMales are, however, more likely than females to be frequent readers of news and magazines:Males more likely than females to be frequent readers of news and magazines, while the reverse is true for booksThe difference in reading rates by formats is something we see in other data, too.

Multiple surveys show that a significant proportion of males are still reading books, though they’re doing so less frequently than they used to. And it’s clear that if there is a crisis of declining reading rates, it is affecting men and women, boys and girls.Anna Burkey, the head of the readingresearch and advocacy group Australia Reads, agrees that focusing on men is something of a red herring.“The problem to me is the downward trend across the population,” she says.“And I think that when we get into conversations about [gender] we get into really unhelpful discussions about boy books and girl books – which don’t exist.“It’s about finding material that is delivered in a format that is suitable for that person, and are we doing that well. And if we get too hung up on the gender divide we get really gendered in our responses, and that’s not going to necessarily solve the core problems [with declining reading rates].”Bryce Courtenay, conspiracies and campfire cooking: the best Australian books out in AugustRead moreSo, what can we do to increase reading rates? Burkey says there are two aspects to this – the personal response and the response from government.At the government level, Burkey says the lack of consistent, detailed and reliable data about reading behaviour is a real problem, and could be addressed by a government-led national reading strategy.“We want a national reading strategy where we’ve got funds to do proper annual tracking around behaviour, and to see if what we’re doing, all these things we’re all trying to boost reading rates, is working,” she says.“We need the funded national strategy and the campaigns that come with that, in a way like we do health advertising. This is a public good.”And at the personal level, Burkey wants everyone, from normal people to politicians and celebrities, to be talking more about reading and books.“It’s about taking the literature out of the book space and just say, what do you love at the moment? And make it as visible as we can. Read, ask people about reading, and try to make it visible.”Nick Evershed is the data and interactives editor for Guardian AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian educationThe CrunchReadinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Yet once again we are having similar conversations.The economy doesn’t seem to be functioning as it should, and may only be capable of growing at a fraction of the rate it used to.The budget is in structural deficit. The population is ageing, and our demand for government services grows and grows, even as ourcapacity to fundthat extra spending goes the other way.Younger Australians are increasingly resentful about their lot, homes are too expensive and the world outside our shores looks more dangerous than it has in decades.Used to being a standout on the global stage, we are being relegated to the back of the pack.Albanese and Chalmers could take the Howard-Costello approach to tax reform. The conditions may never be better | Tom McIlroyRead moreLiving standardsacross the rich world climbed by an average of 22% over the past decade. In comparison, our living standards are up just 1.5%, according to analysis by Chris Richardson, an independent economist.Analysts place a lot of the blame for this on a slowdown on one thing: productivity growth.They point to the fact that our economy is no more productive now than it was in 2016. Over the longer term, productivity growth is the ingredient that delivers higher real wages, generates better-quality goods and helps pay for government services.Technological change can explain a lot of productivity growth over the decades. Thepromise of artificial intelligenceis that it ignites an explosion of new growth as AIembeds itself deeperinto the economy and our lives.With so much apparently at stake, Chalmers in a recent interview was asked if flatlining national productivity was a “crisis”.“No,” the treasurer said, “but it’s a big challenge”.Australia and Australians have a lot of “big challenges”, and some are regularly referred to as “crises”. Yet not all are worthy of a three-day economic reform roundtable with 900 submissions and 40 ministerial mini-roundtables leading up to it.At the National Press Club on 18 June, Chalmers declared that the government has “a responsibility to rebuild confidence in liberal democratic politics and economic institutions – by lifting living standards for working people in particular”.Days out from the start of the roundtable, Chalmers has been at pains to play down the very reform fervour that he fanned.Anthony Albanese appears to have little appetite for spending political capital in pushing through tough economic reforms. The PM has made it clear that there will be – read his lips – no new taxes this term.The treasurer has obediently narrowed the scope of the potential “deliverables” to regulatory reform to get more homes built, with a side promise of some progress on longstanding policy ideas, like a road user charge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Or just a malaise?The lack of a “crisis” in productivity may make it hard to understand why we have spent nearly six weeks leading up to this talkfest in Canberra. But it does help explain the apparent lack of urgency to solve the issue.So what do economists reckon: do we have a productivity crisis?The answer, Richardson quips, “depends whether you like rising living standards or not”.Are we a commodity price collapse away from becoming a 21st-century version of Keating’s “banana republic”? Saul Eslake, another independent economist, says no – the economy now is totally transformed.Rather than crisis, Eslake volunteers the word “malaise”.“I don’t think it would help the debate to call it a productivity crisis,” he adds – that could lead to rushed and short-term measures that might just goose the economy for a year or two.“There are no magic bullets, no short-term solutions. Nothing that can be done, even with the greatest amount of political will, to lift productivity growth in 12 months’ time,” Eslake says.John Hawkins, an economics professor at the University of Canberra, says productivity is not a crisis because it’s “not something that is making people worse off”.Instead: “It’s a lost opportunity to make us better off”.“We got used to the idea that incomes go up over time. Over the long run most of that increase has come from productivity,” Hawkins says.“More recently we got away with low productivity growth because commodities were strong, but we need to do something if we want real income growth going forward.”Shadows of the 1980s, then, from which we can expect echoes of that era’s reforms.Explore more on these topicsAustralian economyProductivityJim ChalmersAustralian politicsPaul KeatinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Successive governments in London and elsewhere have refused to engage in diplomatic relations with the entity since.Despite relentless efforts by Turkish Cypriot authorities to win recognition, only the international republic of Cyprus in the Greek-speaking south is acknowledged. When Keir Starmer last year made the first official visit to the island by a British prime minister in more than 50 years, Starmer refused to meet Tatar, instead holding talks with the Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides.Turkey, to this day, maintains about 35,000 troops in the north.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We now look ahead to continued collaboration with HM government in support of a free and reunited Cyprus.”Explore more on these topicsCyprusLabourForeign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Later, the president’s chief communications adviser said they “haven’t heard anything” about a possible air ceasefire before a trilateral summit, a proposal posted on social media by a journalist.Trump told Fox News after the summit that the swapping of territory inUkrainewas discussed with Putin – something Zelenskyy has repeatedly ruled out.“I think those are points that we negotiated, and those are points that we largely have agreed on,” the US president said. “I think we’re pretty close to a deal,” he added : “Ukraine has to agree to it. Maybe they’ll say no.”After their call, Trump said on Truth Social that he expected to see Zelenskyy on Monday afternoon, and that “if all works out we then will schedule a meeting with president Putin” though the Russian leader has previously been reluctant to meet his Ukrainian counterpart.The US president also said “the best way to end the horrific war” would be “to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up”. WithRussia and Ukraine far apart in their demands, it is not clear how easily that could be achieved.European leaders joined the call for a further half an hour, Zelenskyy added, emphasising that “it is important that Europeans are involved at every stage to ensure reliable security guarantees together with America”.Those joining the call included the leaders of the UK, France, Germany and Italy: Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Giorgia Meloni respectively; as well as the Polish and Finnish presidents, Karol Nawrocki and Alexander Stubb; the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.Shortly after, a second phone call took place, this time between Zelenskyy and various European leaders, to discuss what they had learned from Trump’s account of the summit.There were “positive signals” from the US, Zelenskyy said in his update, “regarding participation in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security”, echoing diplomatic language from last week in the run-up to the summit.Previously, the US has declined to spell out how it might help prevent a future outbreak of fighting as part of a peace agreement, leading to speculation that Washington was hoping to leave the safeguarding of Ukraine almost entirely to Europe.A joint statement from the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and the EU thanked Trump for his mediation efforts, and said they hoped to work towards “a trilateral summit with European support”.The group said Ukraine “must have ironclad security guarantees” and welcomed Trump’s statement that “the US is prepared to give security guarantees”. Reuters reported that there was a discussion of extending a Nato-style guarantee to Ukraine, though the US position on this was not clear.The leaders also declared “it will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory” and that “international borders must not be changed by force”. The group said they would be willing to implement further economic sanctions against Russia if necessary.In a separate statement, Starmer said that while progress had been made, “the next step must be further talks involving president Zelenskyy” and he emphasised that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without him”.Meloni said “the most interesting developments” at the summit were regarding future security guarantees for Ukraine. She highlighted an earlier Italian proposal “inspired by Nato’s article 5”, a clause that states alliance members will come to each other’s aid if one is attacked.“The starting point of the proposal is the definition of a collective security clause that would allow Ukraine to benefit from the support of all its partners, including the USA, ready to take action in case it is attacked again,” she said.Pressure on Russia had to be maintained, Macron said in a social media post. “Any lasting peace must be accompanied by unwavering security guarantees,” he added, welcoming “the readiness of the United States to contribute”.Meanwhile, fighting continued for the 1,270th day since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Three people were killed and 12 wounded in the southern frontline region of Kherson, its governor reported on Saturday.Ukraine’s Azov brigade said it cleared Russian saboteur groups from six villages as it began to close down a breach in the frontline near Dobropillia, in the eastern Donetsk province. The unit claimed it had killed 271 Russian soldiers and wounded 101.Ukraine’s air force said one ballistic missile and 85 drones and decoys were launched into the country, and it had shot down 61 of the latter. Russia said it had taken two villages on the frontline and Ukraine said it had lost another near Pokrovsk.Explore more on these topicsUkraineDonald TrumpRussiaUS foreign policyTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Zuhri had come to Italy with her mother on one of three Italian air force flights that arrived this week with a total of 31 critical patients suffering from serious congenital diseases, wounds or amputations, the Italian foreign ministry said at the time.According to the University hospital of Pisa she had a “very complex clinical picture” and was “in a profound state of organic wasting”, doctors said in a statement.On Friday, after undergoing tests and starting treatment, she had a sudden respiratory crisis and cardiac arrest, and died.The hospital did not elaborate on her condition, but Italian news agencies reporting health facility sources said that she was suffering from severe malnutrition.More than 180 children and young people fromGazahave been brought to Italy since the war began between Israel and Hamas.According to the UN World Food Programme, one-third of the Palestinian population in Gazagoes for days without eating, and half a million are on the brink of starvation, it said in July.“The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)said last month, calling for an urgent ceasefire to alleviate “widespread starvation”.According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) another five people died last week due to malnutrition and starvation, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 227, including 103 children, since October 2023.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,claimed last month: “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza.”However, even Donald Trump, Netanyahu’s key international ally, when asked if he agreed with the Israeli PM, said: “I don’t know … those children look very hungry … that’s real starvation stuff.”Thousands of sick children in Gaza need urgent medical evacuation, according to OCHA.Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the agency, recalled the moment she recognised a young girl requiring treatment in a Gaza hospital that she had met a year earlier, once again suffering from malnourishment.“I remembered her long eyelashes,” the veteran humanitarian told UN News, describing seven-year-old Janah, whom she came across at Gaza City’s Patient Friendly hospital on Tuesday.“The first time I met her was in the IMC Field Hospital in southern Gaza in April 2024. Back then, she was severely malnourished and was getting treatment. And she gradually became better and was released eventually and went home.”However, Janah was now back in hospital “because the malnutrition became aggravated and the condition that she has also is not properly diagnosed and cannot be properly diagnosed”.The girl was on a list of people to be medically evacuated for treatment outside Gaza. The most recent evacuations took place on Wednesday when the World Health Organizationsupportedthe transfer of 32 children and six adults to Italy, Belgium and Turkey, but more than 14,800 patients are still waiting.Cherevko stressed the importance of ensuring that evacuations continue to save as many lives as possible.She pointed out that for children and adults with pre-existing conditions, their situation becomes worse with malnutrition.“It wouldn’t be this way if they had proper nutrition, because these conditions existed before the starvation crisis and they weren’t getting as sick as they are now,” she said.On Saturday the Israeli military announced it was preparing to relocate Palestinians as it launches a new offensive to seize control of northern Gaza City in a plan that has raised international alarm.Explore more on these topicsItalyGazaPalestinian territoriesEuropeFamineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "11.01 EDTClosing summaryThank you for following the Guardian’s live blog. The blog has now closed.Here’s an overview of what happened today:The death toll in Gaza rose to 61,897 people, with 155,600 others wounded, since 7 October 2023, according to the local health ministry.Gaza’s civil defence agency said that Israeli attacks killed at least 22 people today. According to the agency, at least 13 people were killed while trying to access aid distribution sites.At least 11 people, including a child, also died of hunger-related causes since yesterday.Denmark’s prime minister condemned the “horrific images” coming out ofGaza, but said the time is not right to recognise a Palestinian state. Posting onFacebook, Mette Frederiksen said recognition must take place when a “sustainable and democratic state in Palestine without the influence of Hamas” can be created. “And of course it must happen with mutual recognition ofIsrael,” she added.Four Palestinians were wounded in an attack by Israeli settlers north of Hebron in the occupied West Bank,Al Jazeerareported. One person was also wounded after reportedly being shot in the Sheikh Saad area of al-Eizariya, a town bordering occupied East Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society.A cross-party group of MPs called on the government tobring sick and injured children from Gaza to the UKfor treatment “without delay”. A letter to senior ministers signed by 96 MPs stressed that children are at risk of imminent death and any barriers to their evacuation should be lifted.Thousands of people are expected to attend a protest in Tel Aviv today to demand the release of the hostages held inGaza. The demonstration is set to take place at Hostages Square outside Tel Aviv Museum at 8pm local time, before a nationwide strike is held on Sunday.A spokesperson for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) told the Guardian its staff members in Gaza have witnessed “mass casualty events” as people are killed while seeking aid, with some “shot at by the Israeli army”.The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) told the Guardian civilians inGazaare forced to choose between drinking water or using it to wash themselves and keep clean.The Metropolitan police said that 60 more people will be prosecuted for showing support for Palestine Action, which was proscribed by the UK government last month. More than 700 people have been arrested for supporting the group since its proscription on 5 July.Share"

I defy anybody to see a child in need and not want to help.”Last month, government data showeda further 37,000 children were affected by the two-child benefit limitin the year to April, with nearly 1.7 million now living in households affected by the policy.A government spokesperson said at the time: “Through our plan for change, we are reforming the broken social security system to help those who can work into good, well-paid jobs, which is the best way to improve living standards for families … The child poverty taskforce will publish an ambitious strategy later this year to ensure we deliver fully funded measures that tackle the structural and root causes of child poverty across the country.”Explore more on these topicsNeil KinnockBenefitsWelfareLabourChild benefitsPovertySocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

There is an additional charge of 10% of gross profits for bets on UK racing for the statutory Levy, which has returned money to racing since off-course betting was legalised in the early 1960s.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowSouthwell 1.22Golden Prosperity1.52Akabusi2.22Wild Clary2.52Rock Iguana3.22Ultrasoul3.52Vincent Rocks4.22Native Instinct (nap)4.52DivotPontefract 2.12Raulin2.42Delinquent3.12Precious Spartan3.42Stormy Impact4.12Equity Law (nb)4.42Al Sayah5.12Carlton And CoWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The proposal to equalise the duty rate for betting and gaming products was initially floated by the Treasury in the final months of Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, but it survived the transition to a Labour administration and was the subject of a consultation process which closed in July.Betting and gaming have been treated separately for taxation purposes since the Betting and Gaming Act came into force in 1961. There is a widespread belief in racing that a levelling of the duty rates will make the sport more expensive for gambling operators and as a result, far less attractive when compared with gaming products with a guaranteed return.Alternatives for the tax regime around gambling include a proposal from the Social Market Foundation thinktank that gaming duty could be increased to 50% and sports betting to 25%, with changes to the Levy system ensuring that racing would not lose out.The former prime minister Gordon Brown has also advocated for a significant rise in the duty charged on fixed-margin gaming products.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dunshea added: “If the chancellor delivers this tax bombshell at the autumn budget, not only will jobs be lost but the future of Britain’s second-largest spectator sport will be in jeopardy.“This is why it is vital that the government carefully considers the argument made by all British racing’s stakeholders and works alongside us to protect a cherished national institution.” The races lost on 10 September are expected to be added to other cards scheduled around the same time.The date chosen for the racing “strike” is 24 hours before the start of the high-profile St Leger meeting at Doncaster, which the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, and his wife, Victoria, a keen racing fan, attended last year.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingGamblingTaxSport bettingnewsShareReuse this content"

We would always encourage people to speak to us if they have concerns. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further.”The Metropolitan police has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsBBCStrictly Come DancingTelevisionEntertainment TVnewsShareReuse this content"

The system helps to transcribe and take notes in meetings that probation officers have with offenders after they leave prison.AI is also being trialled across the NHS. The technology willanalyse hospital databases and catch potential safety scandals early, providing an early warning system which could detect patterns or trends and trigger urgent inspections.Thefirst NHS AI-run physiotherapy clinichalved the waiting list for back pain and musculoskeletal services. More than 2,500 patients living in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough were able to access Flok Health, a physiotherapy app, over a 12-week period starting in February.And the NHS in England is trialling a “superhuman” AI tool thatpredicts a patient’s risk of disease and dying early.Speaking on a visit to Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said: “This is exactly the kind of change we need, AI being used to give doctors, probation officers and other key workers more time to focus on delivering better outcomes and speeding up vital services.“This government inherited a public sector decimated by years of underinvestment and is crying out for reform.“These AI exemplars show the best ways in which we’re using tech to build a smarter, more efficient state.“When we get this right across government, we’re talking about unlocking £45bn in productivity gains, delivering our plan for change and investing in growth, not bureaucracy.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Wes StreetingHospitalsLondonHealthNHSComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

One was copied from amedical aid charity’s public Instagram accountand the other was from theHouston Chronicle’s YouTube channel.Badly wounded children from Gaza arrived in Houston for emergency treatment in August.After misrepresenting the children, including amputees arriving to get prosthetic legs, as “Islamic invaders from an Islamic terror hot zone”, Loomer demanded to know “who at the US State Department under @marcorubio signed off on the visas for Palestinians from a HAMAS hot zone”.RFK Jr denies 2028 presidential ambitions after attacks from Trump influencer Laura LoomerRead more“Is Rubio even aware of this?” Loomer wrote, in reference to the secretary of state who was at the time in Alaska meeting Vladimir Putin.“Why would anyone at the State Department give visas to individuals who live in Gaza, which is run by HAMAS?” Loomer wrote, before falsely stating that “95% of GAZANS voted for HAMAS.”In fact, Hamas got 44% of party list votes in the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections across Gaza and the West Bank, and lost three of the five districts in Gaza to the secular Fatah party.After the visa program was halted, Loomer declared victory. “This is fantastic news,”she wrotein response to the state department announcement. “Hopefully all GAZANS will be added to President Trump’s travel ban. There are doctors in other countries. The US is not the world’s hospital!”“If Laura Loomer had been around in 1940, she’d have been trying to prevent Jewish refugees from entering the US,” Paul Graham, co-founder of the Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator,wrote on Xafter the halt on visas for wounded children was announced. “You know she would.

They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.“A simple yet profound concept, Mr. Putin, as I am sure you agree, is that each generation’s descendants begin their lives with a purity—an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology,” the first lady writes. “Yet in today’s world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them—a silent defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future.”Rather than appeal to Putin to return the children his government has seized to their home country, the letter vaguely implores the Russian president to “restore their melodic laughter”.“Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today,” Melania Trump’s letter concludes. “It is time.”Slovenian-born Melania Trump did not attend the peace summit between Trump and Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday.But she has previously said that her ambition as US first lady was to be akin to Eleanor Roosevelt, who was known for her work advocating for children’s rights and welfare during Franklin D Roosevelt’s presidency.Ukraine has called the abductions of tens of thousands of its children taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territory without the consent of family or guardians a war crime that meets the United Nations treaty definition of genocide.The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, conveyed his gratitude to the US first lady on his call with Trump on Saturday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said on Saturday.“During the conversation, President Zelenskyy also conveyed his gratitude to first lady Melania Trump for her sincere attention and efforts to bring forcibly deported Ukrainian kids back,”Sybiha said on X. “This is a true act of humanism.”Ahead of Friday’s summit, the White Housestatedthat Russia’s abduction of more than 20,000 Ukrainian children “remains a concern” for Trump seven months into his second presidency. Moscow has previously said it has been protecting vulnerable children from a war zone.The issuereturned to the headlines earlier in August, when the non-governmental organization Save Ukraine accused Russia of “state-sponsored child trafficking” after a group of administrators in Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine published an online catalogue of what they called Ukrainian orphans.Organization head Mykola Kuleba said the database from the Russia-installed administration’s education ministry in the Luhansk region contains data on 294 Ukrainian children under the age of 17 who have been separated from their parents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Thursday, local officialscleared awayone of the roadside encampments Trump had complained about, arguing that they could do so in a more humane fashion than untrained federal forces.A justice department order to replace the Washington police chief, Pamela Smith, with DEA head Terry Cole as the city’s “emergency police commissioner” ran into problems after a challenge in federal court by the DC attorney general, Brian Schwalb.Without issuing a direct ruling on the challenge, US district judge Ana Reyes indicated that Smith has to remain in charge.But efforts to increase federal control of the district resumed on Saturday with the order to deploy West Virginia’s national guard.Drew Galang, a spokesperson for Morrisey, said the state’s national guard received the order to send equipment and personnel to DC late on Friday and was working to organize the deployment.A White House official told Reuters on Saturday that more national guard troops were being called in to Washington to “protect federal assets, create a safe environment for law enforcement officials to carry out their duties when required, and provide a visible presence to deter crime”.View image in fullscreenProtester holds a piece of bread as he walks past national guard, in reference to an incident where a man threw a sandwich at a federal agent on Saturday in Washington, DC.Photograph: Alex Kent/Getty ImagesThe Chamberlain Network, a veteran’s group that describes itself as “dedicated to protecting democracy”,commented on Xthat the order for West Virginia’s national guard to police DC was “pulling them away from their core mission of protecting our communities”.“From floods to winter storms, we count on our Guard on in a crisis,” the group said. “They should be home, ready to respond—not on a political policing mission.”Since arriving in Washington last week, about 800 national guard troops under Trump’s direct control have served as a visible presence in public areas, assigned to administrative and logistical duties as well as “area beautification” work,according to the Wall Street Journal.Defense officials had said they would not be carrying weapons but “weapons are available if needed but will remain in the armory,” the US army said in a press release.Democrats introduce joint resolution to end Trump’s ‘lawless’ DC takeoverRead moreA US official told Reuters that a formal order authorizing the national guard troops to carry firearms would be issued but it would largely affect military police officers with sidearms.The White House also said on Saturday that national guard in DC are conducting patrols on foot and in vehicles around the national mall and Union Station, adding that the troops are not making arrests at this time.Trump has indicated that he may take similar actions in other Democratic-controlled cities. A federal judge in San Francisco is expected in the coming weeks toissue a rulingon whether Trump violated the law bydeployingnational guard troops to Los Angeles in Junewithout the approvalof California’s governor, Gavin Newsom.Typically the national guard is deployed only instances where a state governor requests it.

Many experts believed his political activism, whichtriggered a movementthatdrew the ireof Donald Trump, was the key reason teams were wary of signing him. He later filed a collusion grievance against team owners, which wassettledwith the league in 2019.Representatives for Kaepernick did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Production on the series began in 2022, with Walt Disney-ownedESPNtouting it as a “full, first-person account” of Kaepernick’s journey that would feature extensive interviews with the player.Last year, Puck Newsreportedthe project faced delays amid disagreements between Kaepernick and Lee over the direction of the film.I’m grateful to be able to work with the legend Spike Lee on my docu-series.

Coffee shops in the heart ofNew Yorkare bracing for impact.When the Trump administration announced another wave of sweeping tariffs, particularly onBrazil, Stone Street Cafe’s managing partner was first confused. Then came fear. A cafe already runs on slim margins and extra costs passed on from tariffs could risk everything.“If these tariffs are long term, it will put our business in jeopardy,” Antony Garrigues,managing partner of Stone Street Cafe, said. “In New York City, the operating costs are already so high,and these tariffs will make everything much more expensive.“In the end,if people cannot afford our coffee,and we do not have a profit margin, we will not make it.”Stone Street Cafe, based in Manhattan, sources green coffee beans from more than 35 different countries, including Brazil. But Brazil is not the only coffee-producing nation facing tariff pressures: Vietnam,Colombia, Ethiopia and Indonesia are also affected.“These tariffs are not paid by the country. The costs are passed down to the business owner, and consumer,” noted Garrigues. “For now, we are going to try and absorb as much [of] the cost as we can. But at the end of the day, this is a business – so we may have to increase the prices.”US shoppers feel the heat of Trump’s trade war: ‘the prices are going up’Read moreWith the growing effects of climate change already inflating coffee prices, other cafes have already done so.Aside from coffee Ciao Gloria, in Brooklyn, also imports cocoa powder from Brazil. Jams sourced from Italy now face Trump’s 15% tariff on exports from the European Union. The cafe raised prices by about 25 cents per cup, but plans to absorb any additional tariffs costs, at least for now.“I’m selling sugar and caffeine – I’m basically a drug dealer,” joked owner Renato Poliafito. “So I want to make sure the menu is affordable.”But then he turned serious. “We have to be vigilant about analyzing the situation before jumping to price increases.”Customers are already scrutinizing their receipts. US coffee prices rose 14.5% in the year to July, according to official data.“It’s this idea of shifting baseline where we normalize something being expensive when it shouldn’t [be], and it’s very scary to see,” said Helina Seyoum, 29, who has reverted to making coffee at home. “Now a morning coffee becomes a burden, because you’re obsessing over the costs.”A daily cafe trip was how Aley Longo, 28, made sure she escaped the confines of her studio apartment and spoke to people outside work in an “affordable” way. Now it’s strictly a weekend activity.Trump’s tariffs are “bad for Americans, and our quality of life”, Longo said, “and we are suffering, whether it’s as tiny as just being able to buy coffee out, or something so much bigger”.Those behind the counter know what it’s like to watch the price of a regular purchase grow. Allon Azulai, who owns Kos Kaffe in Brooklyn, which imports beans from countries including Colombia, Honduras and Kenya, described nervously asking vendors for their latest prices each week, as tariffs and mounting demand looms large.“Right now the industry is so unstable and what worries me if tariffs continue is cafes that do not have big pockets will not be able to survive,” said Azulai.‘Straight to the American consumer’As US cafes come under pressure, the coffee producers they source from are also preparing for disruption.Brazil is the world’s largest coffee producer and exporter. The US is the leading destination of its coffee: about a third of its coffee imports are Brazilian.The Brazilian SolubleCoffeeIndustry Association, which represents producers, said the 50% US tariff on the country’s exports amounted to a “clear competitive disadvantage” as other leading countries for coffee production face lower rates, ranging from 10% to 27%.“This decision not only harms the Brazilian industry but could also negatively affect American consumers, who benefit from the quality and competitive price of our coffee,”the association said.Brazilian producers and exporters still hope they can lobby for coffee to be exempt from US tariffs, arguing the US produces very little coffee domestically. The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, had previously suggested products not cultivated on American soil could be granted zero tariffs, they note.If that fails Brazil’s Coffee Exporters Council says it will at least seek to reduce the tariff on coffee to 10%, in line with other Brazilian goods, including oil, orange juice and aircraft. “We remain optimistic and hopeful,”the council said.New coffee export deals with the USare on holdand shipments ready to go are stuck in storage, adding costs for exporters. China has meanwhile approved183 new Brazilian firmsto export coffee, although the exporters’ council cautioned that sales may take time to materialize.InVietnamand Colombia – the world’s second and third largest coffee-producing nations, respectively – exporters hope that lower US tariffs on their coffee will help them steal a march on Brazil.“The US can’t grow coffee at scale, so tariffs won’t bring production back home,” Timen Swijtink, founder of Lacàph Coffees in Vietnam, said. “With the tiny margins in our industry, any tariff cost goes straight to the American consumer.”Even with 20% US tariffs on Vietnam, the country’s farmers “are resilient and will find new markets”, added Swijtink, “with global demand strong and China’s demand growing like a rocket ship”.With the US tariff on Colombia only at the baseline 10%, small coffee growers across the country are shrugging off any immediate impacts. “The average coffee farmer won’t feel it, at least for now,” said José David Posada, a fourth-generation coffee farmer and owner of Capilla del Rosario, a finca in Medellín. “It’s the exporters who will be impacted.”There is also a sense among some that, given Brazil’s tariffs are at 50%, Trump’s tariff war could even help Colombian business. The country’s coffee cultivation is vital to the national economy, representing8% of total Colombian exports.Posada said: “The fact that Brazil has a higher tariff, obviously that’s going to have a positive impact on us, right?”Guilherme Morya, a coffee analyst at Rabobank, said the 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee may, at least in the short term, shift American buyers toward other sources. “Colombia gains a price advantage, and being the second-largest supplier, it becomes the most obvious candidate to fill this gap,” he said.Want to see where Trump’s tariffs are leading US business? Look at GeorgiaRead moreBut Alejandro Lloreda, a farmer at family-run Cafetal de la Trinidad, which produces specialty coffee, cautioned the difference would only give Colombia “a temporary advantage”. “A coffee tree can take two to three years to produce, and the tariff situation could well change before then,” he said.Back in New York, cafe owners find themselves in an equally uncertain position.“The tariffs are to small businesses’ detriment,” said Poliafito, of Ciao Gloria. “Big businesses can find a way around it. But we will suffer the costs.”“It’s scary to not know if we can continue our business,” added Nick Kim, manager of Koré Coffee in Manhattan. “It’s really a shame, and sad, that you know bad things are coming, but you cannot do anything to change it. We have no option but to see what will come.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsBrazilCoffeeDonald TrumpNew YorkColombiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The substitute Rayan Cherki, a £30m signing from Lyon, capped the scoring within eight minutes of entering and Tijjani Reijnders, another one of those pinpointed to drive the close-season makeover, was peerless on his league debut; the Netherlands midfielder was the architect for Erling Haaland’s double, which bookended Reijnders’s first City goal, a feathery first-time finish. “City are back,” crooned the away support and, by the end, it was hard to argue otherwise.Manchester City squad too big and ‘not healthy’, claims Pep GuardiolaRead moreGuardiola, understandably, is not getting carried away. “Last season we were back when we won 2-0 at Chelsea [in our first game] and look what happened afterwards,” the City manager said. “We won [just] today. If you told me we were back in the second half, I’d say no.” City were clinical, scoring with all four shots on target, all of which were easy on the eye, even if Haaland’s first was a tap-in at the end of a move that began with the kind of Reijnders burst that may become commonplace. City had the swagger that has accompanied so much of their success. The injured pair of Rodri and Phil Foden, looking on from the stands, must have pondered where they will fit in.The most moving moment of the match probably came a few minutes after the final whistle, when Rúben Dias and Bernardo Silva, City’s new captain, stood before the South Bank to join Wolves’ players and head coach, Vítor Pereira, in applauding the home fans singing Diogo Jota’s name on loop. Sasa Kalajdzic, an unused substitute, rested his No 18 shirt, which Jota wore during three successful years at Molineux after signing from Porto, on the edge of the box in remembrance.After a stodgy start, City established a comfortable buffer after registering two goals in three first-half minutes. Reijnders is tall and lean and his powerful run was the catalyst for the opener, sidestepping João Gomes before scooping the ball into Rico Lewis, the full-back wanted by Nottingham Forest, who instantly squared for Haaland. City’s No 9 could not miss from a couple of yards out, applying the finish with just his sixth touch, maintaining his perfect goalscoring record on the opening day of the season.It was a slick move but the second stemmed from a loose Emmanuel Agbadou pass, meant for João Gomes. Oscar Bobb, a surprise starter, pinched possession and suddenly it was three v two, Haaland to his right, Reijnders to his left. Bobb slipped in Reijnders and he caressed the ball low into the bottom corner past the Wolves goalkeeper José Sá.View image in fullscreenTijjani Reijnders celebrates with a shrug after scoring Manchester City’s second goal.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesThe galling thing for Wolves, for whom this was a demoralising result to match the mood music at Molineux, was that City’s goals came just as it seemed Pereira’s side were asserting their authority. Marshall Munetsi saw a header ruled out for offside, seconds after John Stones made a brilliant block to deny Jørgen Strand Larsen. Strand Larsen, Norway teammates with Haaland, side-footed wide within a minute of the restart and later thrashed an effort goalwards under pressure from the former Wolves defender Rayan Aït-Nouri but James Trafford enjoyed a near-faultless debut. Pereira was disappointed but not deflated. “I didn’t lose my smile because each mistake that we committed, they punished us with a goal,” said the Wolves head coach. “I will take good things from the game.”This was an emotionally supercharged occasion for Wolves, who paid tribute to Jota with a moving pre-match tribute. It was a surreal sight to see the entire ground glued to the big screens as a montage played 15 minutes before kick-off. There was a giant tifo of Jota celebrating in old gold stretched across the South Bank and the speakers played Jota’s favourite song, Sting’s Fields of Gold. Sa and the defender Matt Doherty both played with Jota, the former at international level. Rui Fuste, Wolves’s long-serving head of medical, attended both Jota’s wedding and his funeral 13 days later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reijnders controlled a long Trafford kick close to halfway and pressed forward purposefully. Then, after a give and go with Bobb, Reijnders showed awareness to cut the ball back for Haaland just inside the box. This time Haaland still had work to do but he cannoned a powerful shot low under Sá. It was another cute move but Cherki’s strike was perhaps the pick of the bunch. Cherki, who turns 22 on Sunday, backheeled Nico González’s pass to fool an overzealous João Gomes, played a one-two with the substitute Nico O’Reilly and promptly threaded a low shot into the bottom corner.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersManchester CityErling Haalandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I feel like I handled situations on the court very well.”The Italian world No 1 had his hands full throughout a tightly contested first set which featured an imperious serving display from both men and not a single break point opportunity for either player.Sinner, who lost only three points on serve in the opening set, held to love for a third consecutive game to force the tie-break, where Atmane handed his opponent the first point with a double fault and from there the Italian never looked back.The reigning US Open, Australian Open and Wimbledon champion opened the second set with a nine-minute hold of serve, then held to love before finally breaking Atmane for a 3-1 lead that gave him the cushion he needed.Sinner followed that with another hold to love to go 4-1 up and all but end any hope for Atmane, who beat the top-10 players Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune en route to his maiden ATP Masters 1000 semi-final.With Atmane serving at 2-5 and looking to stay in the match, Sinner quickly jumped ahead 0-40 before sealing the win on his third match point when the Frenchman sent a forehand into the net. Sinner will face either the No 2 seed, Carlos Alcaraz, or Alexander Zverev in Monday’s final.Explore more on these topicsTennisJannik SinnernewsShareReuse this content"

Despite dominating this match, before and after Ezri Konsa was sent off forAston Villa, Eddie Howe’s team had to settle for a draw against the side they pipped for a Champions League place on goal difference.The travelling fans’ chant – saved until after the final whistle – that “There’s only one greedy bastard” may, numerically speaking, be a moot claim in modern football but you got their point.Still hoping tobuy Yoane Wissafrom Brentford and having let the veteran Callum Wilson leave on a free to West Ham, Newcastle played three wingers across their frontline and only brought on Will Osula, the one striker in their squad, in the 90th minute.Aston Villa v Newcastle: Premier League – liveRead moreVilla, whose fans vented their frustration at thePremier Leaguethroughout the game for the profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) that mean they cannot spend more than €5m net this season, survived Newcastle’s intense start to defend manfully, not least when a player down, and earn their point.Anthony Gordon played down the middle for Newcastle while Harvey Barnes provided several superb passes from the left wing and Anthony Elanga, on his debut on the other flank after a £55m move from Nottingham Forest, missed the best chance of the game in the third minute but was a sharp threat throughout.Howe, who maintained a rapprochement with Isak is possible “but there’s only one person really that can control it”, was heartened by his team’s showing. “We were everything that we’d want to be in that first period, in terms of dominance,” the Newcastle manager said. “I felt just the goals were missing, which is unfortunate timing, really, from our perspective, but I couldn’t be prouder of the group.”He praised Gordon who, he said, enjoys playing centrally. “He was a consistent threat,” he said. “He induced the red card by his pace and his running ability. So there’s no slight on him whatsoever. I thought he was very good. But we have to score goals from different areas – and we always have to: that’s the midfield, our wide men, whether they’re from set plays, so we’ve got to find a way to add goals too.“Of course, you’re going to miss someone that scored the goals that Alex has: not just the goals, but the calibre of player that he is. So we’re not silly enough to think any different, but we just have to look at the players that are here and what they’ve given today. It would be very easy for the players to have a feeling of negativity going into the game or an excuse. But there was no sign of that. So that’s why I’m so pleased with everybody.”Whether Liverpool return with a bid closer to Newcastle’s £150m valuation or Isak changes his mind and seeks to return to the squad at the end of the transfer window, Howe would like to know what cards he is playing with this season. “We would like a resolution,” he said. “Any Premier League season could be hard enough, you don’t need any kind of distraction, to unbalance what we’re doing.”View image in fullscreenAston Villa’s Marco Bizot and Tyrone Mings were kept busy by Newcastle.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersVilla are about to ease their PSR concerns by selling the homegrown Jacob Ramsey to these opponents for an initial £39m, but have been restricted to signing backups, in Evann Guessand, the £26m Ivory Coast striker, and Marco Bizot, the Dutch goalkeeper who enjoyed a superb debut as he deputised for the suspended Emi Martínez.Villa’s regular custodian was sent off on the final day of last season whentheir defeat at Manchester Unitedallowed Newcastle to claim the Premier League’s final Champions League place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Villa’s expected goals at the interval was zero. Unai Emery praised his new goalkeeper, signed from Brest for an undisclosed fee. “I think his first save was giving him confidence,” the Villa manager said. “I am so happy because today we needed him and he did a fantastic new job.”It’s not that Villa were especially poor, just that Newcastle had such greater intensity. “This is the level we must meet,” Emery said.Villa started the second half higher and brighter, and Boubacar Kamara headed John McGinn’s right-wing cross straight at Nick Pope.Then, with Villa finally territorially dominant, Elanga received the ball and, as Gordon timed his acceleration perfectly and his direction of travel even better, Konsa grappled Newcastle’s No 10 to merit his dismissal.Thereafter, this resembled a training game of attack versus defence. In those terms, Villa won. At least both teams have something from which they can build, whatever the vagaries of the transfer market.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Another American, Kenny Bednarek, rounded out the podium in 9.96sec.“It felt alright. My job is to get the job done,” said Thompson.The Jamaican, who missed the cut for the 2023 world championships in Budapest, will be one of the favourites for this year’s edition in Tokyo on 13-21 September.But he downplayed the significance of the result.“Honestly, I compete against myself, no offense to the competition,” he said.Lyles put a positive spin on his second place, saying it was a “great stepping stone”.“I needed to see a sub-10,” the American said. “I needed to see winning, beating people, I took out some really big heads today, people who run 9.7 and 9.8.“I am getting the confidence. It makes me really excited for not only today, but also for next week and Tokyo.”Lyles was drawn in lane seven, outside Bednarek and inside Christian Coleman, with Thompson in five and South African Akani Simbine to his left.But it was Thompson who stole the march in hot and humid conditions, rocketing out of his blocks to leave the field in his wake for a true gun-to-tape display.Lyles had the joint slowest reaction of the nine-man line-up and looked to be out of even a podium finish from the start before he came through strongly over the closing 20 metres to pinch second place from Bednarek.Thompson’s winning time matched the 9.87sec meet record jointly held by Americans Ronnie Baker and Fred Kerley.It did not quite match the world-leading 9.75sec he set at the Jamaican trials in June, a time which puts him sixth on the all-time list.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The former red beret paratrooper and current president of a Rockhampton canoe club is explaining to a first-time paddler why he won’t begin on a K1 – the kind of craft the world’s best canoe sprinters will paddlewhen and if they come hereto central Queensland to compete at the 2032 Olympic Games.“It’s like sitting on a pencil,” Miller says. “If a crocodile so much as tapped your hull, you’d be straight into the drink!”The club secretary, John Mackenzie, admonishes him: “You had to use the C-word.”To be fair to Miller, the proximity of the world’s largest living reptile is not much of a secret. On the wall of the humble green shed belonging to the Fitzroy Canoe Club is a mascot of sorts: a toy croc called Fitzy. Pinned to the noticeboard are tips on being “Croc Wise”. The club’s paddling area is a known crocodile habitat, the note reads. Enter boats “briskly”. Don’t drag arms and legs in the water. If you capsize, get out as soon as possible.In March, the Queensland government announced that the Fitzroy River in Rockhampton, about 500km north ofBrisbane, would host rowing and canoeing events at the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.map of queenslandScattered along the banks of the Fitzroy are signs warning of injury or death from saltwater crocodiles. A four-metre croc can be right beside you in the water, invisible, one reads.Visitors to the “beef capital of Australia” are extremely unlikely to see a live saltie.But they won’t miss representations of the prehistoric ambush predator throughout the grand sandstone and wrought iron buildings of the river port. In the lane behind the newly refurbished Rockhampton Museum of Art is a crocodile mural, 18 metres long and five metres high.But now the C-bomb has been dropped, the jokes are carpeted.View image in fullscreenThe Fitzroy Canoe Club secretary, John Mackenzie, had a ‘majestic encounter’ with a saltwater crocodile.We hop out to our boats atop the backs of crocodiles, Miller reckons. But don’t worry, the crocs aren’t hungry – “we feed them all the time”.After the gags, Miller gets serious. You won’t encounter a croc, he promises. Just enjoy the river, there isn’t a better one between here and the mighty Murray.And with that, as the pinks and purples of dawn filter through the leaves of paperbarks that line the Fitzroy’s banks, the canoeists paddle off into the mist that rises from the chalky brown water.Corellas screech from towering gums. Pelicans break the still surface of the river. An osprey peers down from the branches of a dead tree. The kayak quivers as its rudder hits a clump of duckweed.The canoeists paddle upstream, away from the city and the barrage that divides the Fitzroy between its salt and freshwater reaches.This piece of infrastructure is one reason Miller contends the river is “pristine”. Unlike those to the south, the freshwater Fitzroy is not swept by tides, lined by mud and mangrove or racked by wind and wave.View image in fullscreenThe Fitzroy River barrage.Photograph: Sylvia Liber/The GuardianThat concrete barrier, built as a water storage system to help meet the region’s water supply needs, also marks a boundary on the government’sQueenslandcrocodile management plan between targeted management and general management zones.Upstream of the barrage for 20km, park rangers are tasked with removing “all large crocodiles” and any croc “displaying dangerous behaviour” from the water.After a couple of kilometres, a pair of canoeists pass through a stretch of river they claim is the territory of a croc about the length at which it is officially considered “large” – that is, longer than 2 metres.A few kilometres farther upstream is the spot that one canoe club member sighted a 4.5 metre saltie two years ago. After several weeks, it was captured and removed.View image in fullscreenA crocodile safety sign along the Rockhampton riverside.This is winter, too – the same time of year that sunny Queensland will host the summer Olympics – and the period in which crocs are most easy to spot, basking their cold blood on riverbanks.Yet, statistically, Miller is almost certain to be right. The Boyne River, more than 100km to the south, is officially considered the southern boundary of typical crocodile habitat.Here in the lower reaches of croc country, the number and density of these apex predators is far lower than in the far away tropics to the north. A government monitoring program estimates the number of crocodiles in rivers of the Cape York peninsula – more than 1,500km to the north – at three crocodiles per kilometre. That ratio declines southward, down to 0.2 crocs per km on the Fitzroy.View image in fullscreenSaltwater crocodiles were declared a protected species in the 1970s after the population was decimated by hunting.Photograph: imageBROKER.com/AlamyThe canoe club has been paddling here since the late 1970s without incident. They are on the water almost every day, often starting in the dark. So, too, their rowing counterparts, who are also looking forward to hosting the Olympics.Mackenzie says he has been paddling in the river for the past seven years and has seen a croc upstream of the barrage only once.It was during the colder months and the saltie had its snout out of the water. During the central Queensland winter, he says, crocodiles aren’t breeding, aren’t territorial and aren’t hungry. He wasn’t worried at all.“It was doing its thing, and I was doing mine,” Mackenzie says. “It was quite a majestic encounter”.Other local water users aren’t so enamoured of sharing the water with these toothy reptiles.Steve Diehm grew up five minutes from the boat ramp above the barrage on the banks of the Fitzroy and has spent his whole life in Rockhampton. An avid waterskier, Diehm had a boat before he had a car.View image in fullscreenSteve Diehm stopped waterskiing on the Fitzoy River because of his fear of crocodiles.Photograph: Sylvia Liber/The GuardianThe Fifo oil and gas worker met his wife and raised his three children waterskiing. But, over recent years, Diehm began being gnawed by a sense of unease familiar to many north of the tropic of capricorn.Since they were protected in the 1970s after being hunted to near annihilation, saltwater crocodiles – which despite their name also inhabit freshwater environments – have been steadily returning to their former range, reclaiming waterways that people swam for decades.Diehm had always been aware he was in croc habitat but began to feel less and less safe. Then, when he saw a picture of that 4.5 metre saltie captured in 2023, a “horrible feeling” wrenched his stomach. He had skied that “exact bank” for 15 years. Diehm thought about his children.The 46-year-old was devastated when he made the decision that it was no longer safe for his family to be on the Fitzroy.Looking out across the river gives Diehm a pang of remorse. It is perfectly smooth, basking in sunshine, a “skier’s dream” – and there is not a soul on the water.View image in fullscreenScott Lawton and Andrew Miller paddle along the Fitzroy River, which will host 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games events despite concerns about increasing crocodile numbers.Photograph: Sylvia Liber/The Guardian“This should be like the Murray Darling,” he says. “There should be houseboats workin’ on here. There should be, you know, park a houseboat, swim off it, ski off it.“All this, all the way up here, there’s this ability for tourism, for so much good, old-fashioned, outdoor fun.”Diehm believes the Olympics would be great for Rockhampton but, without a change to crocodile management, he reckons athletes will be “running the gauntlet”.The University of Queensland’s crocodile expert, Prof Craig Franklin, runs the world’s largest and longest active crocodile tracking program.The Fitzroy Olympics plan “worries” him “on a number of levels”.View image in fullscreenAndrew Miller encourages visitors to forget their crocodile fears and enjoy the Fitzroy.“No. I don’t believe it’s safe,” he says. “I think it’s foolish.”Franklin fears the Olympic event sends the message that it is “OK to go swimming” in places like the Fitzroy. But crocodiles travel vast distances over short periods, crossing barriers and moving overland for several kilometres.“Rowing in a place where it’s the natural habitat of the world’s largest species of crocodilian and, arguably, the most dangerous?” he says. “Why would you do that?”For Mackenzie, though, there is no other river like it.Still flush from his early morning canoe as he sips a coffee at his regular cafe near the river, the retired financial planner reflects that many people worry about all the wrong things. In the year to early August, 178 people have died on Queensland roads.That morning, Mackenzie watched the Fitzroy’s surface ripple with the movements of big catfish, barramundi and bum-breathing turtles.So, yes, he knows there are risks when he gets on to the water, but they are ones Mackenzie gladly accepts.One of the beauties of this river, he says, is that it’s alive.Explore more on these topicsCrocodilesQueenslandBrisbane Olympic Games 2032featuresShareReuse this content"

It is all part of an £80m project intended to reinvent and regenerate the post-industrial riverside area around the Stadium of Light but West Ham had evidently not bargained for this rejuvenation extending to the football team.As the second half unfolded, an exhilarating afternoon that exceeded the wildest dreams of even the most optimistic Sunderland fans became not so much an adventure as an ordeal by the North Sea for West Ham’s manager.Brighton v Fulham, Tottenham v Burnley, Sunderland v West Ham, and more – clockwatch liveRead more“Disappointed with that,” said Graham Potter. “We have to learn the lesson that it’s difficult to win matches. It’s one game but we have to bounce back. We have to be better. We have to make it happen.”In marked contrast, Régis Le Bris looked as if he was struggling to stop smiling. “I’m happy for the fans,” he said. “We just have to enjoy this. West Ham are a strong team who maybe didn’t play their best football today.”Right from the start a counterattacking Sunderland, featuring seven summer signings, looked quick, agile and nimble-footed.While an array of new faces including the excellent Habib Diarra and Granit Xhaka shone, it was three of the old boys, Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard and Wilson Isidor, who scored the goals.Although West Ham, with Jarrod Bowen looking dangerous, held their own in the opening half they were restricted to two chances. Then, in the course of a chastening second period featuring some assiduous man-to-man marking, the visitors folded.They had perhaps failed to heed the warning delivered when Diarra, the club-record £30m midfield recruit from Strasbourg, showed off an impressive change of first-half pace as he executed a slick one-two with Mayenda. The heart of defence was pierced and only a decent save from Mads Hermansen kept the score goalless.For all Diarra’s fleet-footed probing, Noah Sadiki’s snappy tackling and the way the deep-sitting Xhaka showed why Bayer Leverkusen were so reluctant to part with him, West Ham were still not exactly out of things. It took a sliding, last-ditch clearance on Ballard’s part to prevent El Hadji Malick Diouf shooting the visitors ahead.View image in fullscreenDan Ballard heads home the second goal of the match.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Ed Sykes/Apl/SportsphotoOne of football’s little mysteries revolves around the failure of one of the so-called “elite” clubs to poach Bowen. Goodness knows where West Ham would be without him.Robin Roefs, Sunderland’s new Netherlands Under-21 goalkeeper, who was preferred to the playoff hero Anthony Patterson, showed off some nifty footwork and had not been overexerted.Nordi Mukiele must have felt reassured he was making the right choice in swapping Paris Saint-Germain for Sunderland.

Formally registered a little after 10.30 on Saturday morning, Barcelona’s economic obstacles overcome, he was introduced just after 9pm with 22 minutes left of a sticky and ultimately successful night in Mallorca. By the time he pulled on his shirt and stepped up the line, one of three subs brought on, the temperature had dropped a little, if still not enough, the game was already won, he was up against just nine men, and he got 10 touches. It wasn’t much, but it was a start.Earlier than expected, too: Rashford had insisted he was confident but the doubts over him being registered were not resolved until the morning of the match. And so, on 68 minutes, there he was waiting to come on.Thomas Partey protests notable by absence on Villarreal debutRead morePlaying through the middle with Barcelona already 2-0 up and drifting through a second half that Hansi Flick said he didn’t like at all, Rashford produced a couple of neat layoffs, a handful of passes and had two fleeting glimpses of goal. In one, he was a little slow to react, in the other the ball was caught under his feet as he trued to cut back inside. He did though get a close-up glimpse of another moment of magic from Lamine Yamal, who provided the final touch withthatLamine Yamal goal. That’s some teammate he has there.A video from training had done the rounds last week in which Lamine Yamal had responded to another bamboozled opponent by declaring: “I’m unstoppable,” and he didn’t waste time lending weight to that claim. His season was just two minutes in, when he twisted, turned, stopped started and escaped into the area, a warning to Johan Mojica andMallorca– if they needed it – that this wasn’t going to be an easy evening. Just five minutes later, he slipped the knife in, clipping in what appeared an easy, almost lazy ball to the far post. There, all alone and from close range, Raphinha headed Barcelona into the lead.There was a kind of stillness about the place, like someone had pressed pause: if had been too simple, the space the Brazilian had too big for it to be real. But, while the referee did pause to check for offside, it was.Mallorca did react, Vedat Muriqi laying off inside the Barcelona area when he might have taken the shot himself. Mojica was making progress up the left in those moments when he was released from watching Lamine Yamal, his low deliveries the source of the most danger. There was an attempted overhead kick from Takuma Asano and an opportunity for Muriqi, which he struck straight at Joan García in Barça’s goal.View image in fullscreenLamine Yamal celebrates after completing the scoring.Photograph: Francisco Ubilla/ReutersAnd then Barcelona scored a second. Again, there was something strange about it – more so than the first time. Lamine Yamal had come inside and hit a shot that Antonio Raíllo had blocked with his head. The centre-back collapsed to the floor, his head in his hands, his face on the turf, and the ball looped up. When it came down again, Lamine Yamal just about controlled. Ferran Torres took the ball, stumbled past a couple of chances and smashed a superb shot into the top corner.Quick GuideRoundup: Kane and Díaz score in Bayern's Super Cup winShowBayern Municheased pastVfB Stuttgart2-1 thanks to goals from Harry Kane and Luis Díaz to lift the Franz Beckenbauer Supercup. The Bavarians were sharper throughout and their goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was in fine form less than a week before the Bundesliga season starts.With all eyes on the Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade, whom Bayern are keen to sign, Kane, last season’s Bundesliga top scorer,  pounced on a defensive error by Luca Jaquez to give the champions an 18th-minute lead.The German Cup winners went in search of a quick equaliser and Woltemade went close, only for his point-blank shot to be saved by Neuer. The 39-year-old keeper again came to the rescue in the 75th when he showed good reflexes to palm a deflected shot wide.Díaz, a summer signing from Liverpool, scored with his first effort on goal, heading in a Serge Gnabry cross 13 minutes from time. The Colombia international striker marked his competitive debut goal with a tribute to Diogo Jota, copying the late Liverpool forward's video game celebration (pictured). Stuttgart grabbed a stoppage-time consolation through Jamie Leweling’s close-range header.Eric Dier scored on his competitive debut forMonaco, who kicked off their Ligue 1 campaign with a comfortable 3-1 home win overLe Havre.An own goal by the Le Havre defender Gautier Lloris put Monaco ahead in the 32nd minute. Dier doubled the hosts' lead shortly after the hour mark, finding the target off Lamine Camara's cross.Le Havre, who finished one point above the relegation playoff spot last season, struck back six minutes later with Rassoul Ndiaye cutting in from the left and finding the net near the far post with a low right-footed shot.The visitors pushed for an equaliser but paid the price for their high defensive line when Denis Zakaria ran up the empty space into the Le Havre box and crossed to Maghnes Akliouche for a close-range finish.Lyonalso got their campaign off to a winning start when Georges Mikautadze scored in added time before the break to give them a 1-0 win atLens.ReutersPhotograph: S Mellar/FC BayernWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Six seconds had passed, Raíllo was still down, and while no one had stopped exactly, or not physically, perhaps mentally they had, as if waiting for a whistle that never came. The shot flew past Raíllo who was still on the ground and Leo Román didn’t dive – although that might have been as much about the possibility of getting there anyway. Pedri slapped palms with Torres but there was a kind of shrug from the scorer, as if everyone assumed this wouldn’t count. It did.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two goals down, they were quickly two men down. An outrageous turn and run from Lamine Yamal began on the halfway line and, beyond Mojica and Sergi Darder, ended on the edge of the Mallorca area, where Manu Morlanes clipped him. Morlanes was shown a second yellow. That was on half an hour; within nine minutes, another man walked. Muriqi was originally shown a yellow card for his challenge on García but, freeze-framed, it looked worse on the video assistant referee screen: a set of studs in the keeper’s face led to the yellow being upgraded to a red.This was done bar the shouting – and there was a lot of that, of course. Hands were up because this, the fans claimed, was a robbery. Lamine Yamal wanted his goal, twice sending shots just wide before the break and then bending one over at the start of the second half. Flick though was not happy with what he saw in that second half, and Lamine Yamal would have to wait until the final minute.There had been chances for others too, even if Mallorca resisted pretty well two men down. Raphinha shot wide, Dani Olmo hit a post, Ronald Araújo volleyed wide. Leo Román made a superb save from Olmo and another from Eric García. Rashford joined in but didn’t get the chance to test the keeper, a swift one-two with Pedri earning him a raised thumb but not a shot on goal. And then, as the clock went past 90, when he was looking for space to shoot he appeared to tread on the ball, leaving time for just one more moment, and that belonged to Lamine Yamal.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaMallorcaBarcelonaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In front of an exuberant home crowd still basking in ending theirlong wait for a trophy, a breathtaking bicycle kick from a rejuvenated Richarlison sealed a convincing victory in the Dane’s first Premier League match in charge of Tottenham.The new £55m signing Mohammed Kudus was also outstanding as he set up both of the Brazilian’s goals before Brennan Johnson rounded things off against aBurnleyside that proved a tough nut to crack. After conceding the opener to Richarlison – who was a bit-part player under Ange Postecoglou last season and had been linked with a move away this summer – in the 10th minute, Scott Parker’s side had their chances against a Spurs defence that creaked at times. They ultimately paid the price of their profligacy but will be encouraged by this display.Sunderland 3-0 West Ham, Tottenham 3-0 Burnley, Brighton 1-1 Fulham – clockwatch liveRead moreAs negotiations with Crystal Palace edge closer over a move for Eberechi Eze, these are exciting times for Tottenham supporters. Frank showed he is not afraid to gamble by starting the teenagers Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall in central midfield and was rewarded with the kind of committed performance that so often eluded his predecessor, at least in this competition.“That’s our dream start. We all know we need to follow up on it, but today I will just enjoy it,” said Frank who, as became customary after every home victory during his seven years at Brentford, applauded the whole ground on a lap of honour after hugging every member of his staff.Asked whether he was still hoping to add players to his squad before the end of the transfer window, he added: “We are definitely in the market.”After coming so close to winning a trophy in hisfirst match in chargeagainst Paris Saint-Germain in the Super Cup, the new head coach was given a rapturous reception when he emerged from the tunnel before kick-off. Burnley might have set a defensive record in the Championship last season after conceding only 16 goals but they let in 78 in their last Premier League campaign.Even after adding plenty of top-flight experience in Kyle Walker and Martin Dubravka, Burnley looked like they knew they were in for a long afternoon from the start, especially in only the fourth minute when Dubravka fell foul of tighter regulations on goalkeepers holding on to the ball for longer than the permitted eight seconds and Tottenham were duly awarded a corner.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank, after his first league match as Spurs head coach, acknowledges the home fans.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesParker was the last player to leave West Ham for Spurs in 2011 and he watched Kudus make an instant impression when he found space down the right flank in the 10th minute and whipped in a brilliant cross for Richarlison to finish first time. Their travelling supporters probably feared the worst at that point but Burnley slowly found their feet as Lyle Foster and Josh Laurent saw efforts go wide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Adopting a more casual look than Parker’s suit, jacket and tie, the Spurs manager was more encouraged by his side’s start to the second half. Richarlison should have doubled his tally after his initial effort struck Maxime Estève on the shoulder but Dubravka’s outstretched boot did just enough to divert the ball wide.Burnley had two chances to make them pay when the lively Foster set up Hannibal Mejbri, only for Pape Sarr to make a last-ditch tackle before Anthony directed his header straight at Vicario. It was to prove crucial. “That’s the ruthlessness of thePremier League,” said Parker. “We’ve got a huge challenge ahead of us but it’s one we are going to embrace.”With Tottenham’s next attack, Kudus again left his marker for dead with a clever piece of skill and Richarlison swivelled in mid-air before hammering in his cross. The Brazilian also played his part in the third goal when he eluded Estève’s challenge in the centre circle and Sarr was able to surge forward to play in Johnson, with last season’s top scorer making no mistake. Richarlison left the field to a standing ovation as a new era dawned in this part of north London.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurBurnleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Eze’s release clause of £67.5m expired on Friday and there are indications that the 27-year-old may end up costing around £55m plus add-ons. There is a chance that negotiations will conclude with the initial fee for the England international falling under £55m.Palace are looking for a sizeable chunk of the guaranteed portion of the deal paid up front if they are to sell the player who scored the winning goal in last season’s FA Cup final. Oliver Glasner’s side have identified Leicester’s Bilal El Khannouss as a potential replacement for Eze. QPR are understood to be due a sell-on clause of 15% of any profit made on any transfer after Palace signed Eze for £19.5m in 2020.Arsenal have also been in the hunt for Eze, who has developed into one of the most exciting attackers in the Premier League during his time at Selhurst Park, but they have dithered over a move. Mikel Arteta has options in attacking midfield and Arsenal have been keen to sell fringe players before making a bid.New Spurs captain Cristian Romero is committed to club, insists FrankRead moreSpurs are looking to add creativity to Thomas Frank’s squad and can offer Eze Champions League football. The former QPR player is keen on the move, with personal terms not expected to be a problem.The prospect of a deal being agreed with Spurs is understood to have led to discussions being held over Eze missing Palace’s trip to Chelsea, leaving Glasner with a selection problem in attack.Palace are also at risk of losing Marc Guéhi. Liverpool have held talks over the England defender, who has no intention of extending his contract before it expires next year.Glasner said on Friday that he expected Eze and Guéhi to feature against Chelsea. “Marc has trained the entire week with us, every single training session, the same with Ebs,” he said. “They’ve prepared the best way for the Chelsea game on Sunday afternoon. I’ve been in the football business for too long, so I know that at any time of any day, things can happen. If you ask me now, I expect both Marc and Ebs to start on Sunday.Nottingham Foresthave confirmed the £37m club-record arrival of Omari Hutchinson fromIpswichon a five-year contract. Hutchinson has been joined at the City Ground by his England Under-21s teammate James McAtee fromManchester City, who has cost £30m.The 21-year-old Hutchinson said: “I’m really excited to be here and can’t wait to get started. I’ve played at the City Ground a few times and it’s always felt like a hostile atmosphere. It’s a new chapter for me but I feel ready.”This week Nuno Espírito Santo, whose side hostBrentfordon Sunday, expressed concerns his squad was not ready to cope with playing in four competitions after qualifying for the Europa League when Crystal Palace were demoted to the Conference League.Brentfordhave signed Dango Ouattara fromBournemouthfor a club record £42.5m.

The light fades, but against the setting sun his silhouette is distinctive: the floppy hair, the hunched gait, the vast calves. Jack Grealish is working, honing and polishing, inventing, striving at the limits of technical excellence.He hasinspired Aston Villa to promotion. He has helped them avoid relegation, establish themselves as a Premier League side. He is enormously popular. Even opposing fans admire his ability, warm to the sense he is still in some way the impish kid in the playground, revelling in his ability, having fun. That summer at the Euros he had become acause célèbre, the figure behind whom the clamour for Gareth Southgate to release the handbrake rallied, the poster boy for the sort of pundit who wished England would just believe in talent.Jack Grealish joins Everton on loan and hopes to emulate Rooney and GascoigneRead moreBut Grealish wanted more. He was a Villa fan, loved the club, but he wanted to test himself at the very highest level, to compete for the league title, to play in the later stages of the Champions League. He did not want to be just the cheeky kid with the jinking feet; he had professional ambition. At which there came a flash of light, a puff of smoke, and there appeared on the heath a cadaverous, dark-haired figure – Mephistopheles, or perhaps an agent. Grealish could have all these things, the figure said, he could lift trophies, even win a treble, if only he signed asix-year contract with Manchester City. As Grealish reached for the pen, the figure murmured, almost under his breath, that there would be a cost. But by then the deal was done.Which is how we have come, four years later, to this week, and Grealish, the first £100m signing by a British club,being loaned to Everton. He has won three league titles, a Champions League and an FA Cup; the cadaverous figure has fulfilled his part of the bargain. Yet there lurks a sense that Grealish’s move four summers ago has not quite worked out, that though much has been won, much too was lost. Perhaps David Moyes, a common line of thought runs, can help the lost boy rediscover his sense of joy.Looked at coldly, Grealish’s career has mapped an almost perfect arc. A kid shows talent, joins his local club, prospers, leaves them for a giant, wins trophies, has one outstanding season, and then, as he approaches 30, he drops down again joining another of England’s slumbering giants. How else should a career look? You would probably want that third phase to start two or three years later but that aside, this is pretty much the model. Had he stayed at Villa, there would have been corners of the internet mocking him for his lack of ambition and lack of medals, as happened with Harry Kane before he left Tottenham for Bayern.View image in fullscreenDid Pep Guardiola hinder Jack Grealish’s creativity?Photograph: Roger Evans/Action Plus/ShutterstockBut Grealish has become entwined with a broader discussion, the doubts about the effectiveness of Pep Guardiola’s methods – which itself is a broad spectrum, ranging from kneejerk hostility from instinctive nostalgists who believe simple is always good, to considered analysis that wonders whether an obsessive focus on position and possession can make a side predictable now that the world has become familiar with the basic Guardiola methods.Foremost among that second category is Guardiola himself, a manager who has maintained a state of almost perpetual evolution. That is one of the reasons he signed Grealish: to add imagination and improvisation, just as, a year later, hewould sign Erling Haaland, another player who did not obviously fit his system, who might generate the friction that would generate the sparks of creativity.Or at least it appears that was the plan. Haaland resisted, refused his manager’s demands to drop deep, to convert himself into a gigantic creative midfielder. Grealish did not. Whatever Guardiola originally intended for him, he soon began to craft Grealish to his philosophy.Amid the celebrations at the end of the 2021-22 season, as City came from2-0 down to beat Aston Villaand win the title, Grealish, whose candid nature is part of his charm, spoke of how inhibited he at times felt by Guardiola’s demands; his dribbles per game had dropped by 40%. The system had, perhaps inevitably, changed him more than he had changed the system.The following season was Grealish’s best at City. He won the treble. He scored five goals in the league and set up another seven. Guardiola trusted him in the biggest games; he started every knockout game in the Champions League. Teammates nicknamed him the Rest Station because you could give him the ball and take a couple of seconds breather, knowing he was not going to give it away. His dribbles per game rose by 7%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He became a Guardiola player. But the next season he started only 10 Premier League games. The one after that, last season, he started seven. Dribbles per game dropped by 56%. When City were chasing a goal inthe FA Cup final against Crystal Palace, Guardiola preferred to turn to Claudio Echeverri, a 19-year-old Argentinian who had never played for the club. And with that it was over.View image in fullscreenJack Grealish started only seven league games last season, a clear sign he had fallen out of favour at Manchester City.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Neal Simpson/Apl/SportsphotoInjuries have not helped, but neither has his lifestyle – andGuardiola implied a linkafter Grealish suffered a recurrence of a groin injury in February last year. Very few modern footballers have been pictured quite so often in the company of alcohol. That is not to say Grealish has led a life of hedonism, or even of a footballer of 30 years ago, but neither is he one of the “obedient little schoolboys” – to use Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s term – favoured by Guardiola.Whether that is how he has always lived or whether he lost some hunger after winning the treble, only Grealish can know. Perhaps he could tolerate the restrictions only so long. But he is still young. If he can remain injury-free, there could be a glorious third act to his career, perhaps even a trophy at a club that would really appreciate it.And if he could rediscover that sense of joy while doing so, if he can make the Faustian deal a temporary contract, what a career that would be, beginning and ending as a popular schoolyard player, with a curious trophy-winning interlude in the middle.Explore more on these topicsEvertonInside footballAston VillaManchester CityPep GuardiolaFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

Mason will already know that substitutions may provide the pivot between failing and thriving, and so a lunchtime double switch that instantly earned three preciousChampionshippoints against Wrexham will have, whether he needed it or not, provided a nice little boost.Jed Wallace had been on the pitch just 28 seconds when he beat Danny Ward. Setting him up was Mikey Johnston who had entered at the same time. Moments earlier there would doubtless have been away end grumblings as Tom Fellows, who set up Isaac Price’s opener and had been as lively as a child given unlimited Haribo supplies, departed for Wallace. That disappointment soon dissipated and was replaced by unrestrained joy when seven minutes later Johnston provided Price the cross from which he headed in his second.Mason could have taken the easy option and remained at Tottenham. His affiliation there spans more than two decades, and he almost certainly would have had a role under Thomas Frank. But having just tasted Europa League glory, he wanted to push himself and informed Ange Postecoglou that he was departing before Postecoglou himself was removed. Two wins from two league games is a lovely little start.View image in fullscreenWrexham co-owners Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds watch from the stand.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PA“It’s nice because I’m sure there’ll be scenarios this year where I’ll make subs and get criticised for it,” Mason said. “Most importantly for me, though, is that the players arrive on the pitch present and ready to help the team. We certainly had that today.”Wrexham’s bench was full of angst by the end, with Lewis O’Brien’s first-half equaliser and Sam Smith’s stoppage-time consolation proving moot. Phil Parkinson’s side made home a fortress during their triple promotion, suffering only six defeats here across their last 92 league games. However, as they are learning, Championship opponents will not simply cower in the corner.“We’ve got to find a tenacity and a desire to defend our box better than we’ve done today,” said Parkinson. “If teams beat us and score against us, they’ve got to have really earned it. I don’t think they had to earn it enough today.”And so, the first second-tier game here for 15,799 days ended in red rage, and Ryan Reynolds’ and Rob McElhenney’s homebound flights may well be melancholy. Instead, a small blue-and-white pocket went boing boing in the sunshine almost from the moment their No 21 struck in the 21st minute.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The same three adjectives can be used to describe the finish. West Brom’s two outstanding young talents were continual nuisances. The worry for supporters? Given the club’s continuing battle with profitability and sustainability rules, one or other may depart in the next fortnight, should the price be right.So scared were Wrexham of Fellows that the central defender Lewis Brunt was booked after grappling him far closer to West Brom’s box than his own. The Championship, as one home fan observed, was already proving “completely relentless. You don’t get time to catch breath.”However, even in defeat, Kieffer Moore showed just how crucial he is. For most modern footballing success stories, Moore would simply be a plan B forward. For Parkinson he is the man around whom a campaign will be built.Early on, Moore – who occupies that Darren Huckerby zone, his talent at a level between the top two divisions – won a large handful of headers and may as well have laughed at Nat Phillips when the defender tried to outmuscle him. Yet Wrexham’s only attacking moment of note until half-time neared was losing Josh Windass to injury. Record-signing Nathan Broadhead replaced him.For the leveller, Moore found himself in acres on the right and in turn found James McLean in the box. McLean’s touch accidentally teed up O’Brien, the finish bringing a visceral Welsh roar.Shortly after the restart, Broadhead fluffed his lines, but Wrexham’s belief grew. Then came Mason’s killer change. The home side have written the script so many times over the past four years, yet here Mason occupied the director’s seat. 2-1. 3-1. Game done.Even Smith’s late intervention did not prevent West Brom sealing a first away league win since last November. “Early results are important,” Mason added. “We are seven weeks into this new journey we are on together.

There is an additional charge of 10% of gross profits for bets on UK racing for the statutory Levy, which has returned money to racing since off-course betting was legalised in the early 1960s.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowSouthwell 1.22Golden Prosperity1.52Akabusi2.22Wild Clary2.52Rock Iguana3.22Ultrasoul3.52Vincent Rocks4.22Native Instinct (nap)4.52DivotPontefract 2.12Raulin2.42Delinquent3.12Precious Spartan3.42Stormy Impact4.12Equity Law (nb)4.42Al Sayah5.12Carlton And CoWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The proposal to equalise the duty rate for betting and gaming products was initially floated by the Treasury in the final months of Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, but it survived the transition to a Labour administration and was the subject of a consultation process which closed in July.Betting and gaming have been treated separately for taxation purposes since the Betting and Gaming Act came into force in 1961. There is a widespread belief in racing that a levelling of the duty rates will make the sport more expensive for gambling operators and as a result, far less attractive when compared with gaming products with a guaranteed return.Alternatives for the tax regime around gambling include a proposal from the Social Market Foundation thinktank that gaming duty could be increased to 50% and sports betting to 25%, with changes to the Levy system ensuring that racing would not lose out.The former prime minister Gordon Brown has also advocated for a significant rise in the duty charged on fixed-margin gaming products.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dunshea added: “If the chancellor delivers this tax bombshell at the autumn budget, not only will jobs be lost but the future of Britain’s second-largest spectator sport will be in jeopardy.“This is why it is vital that the government carefully considers the argument made by all British racing’s stakeholders and works alongside us to protect a cherished national institution.” The races lost on 10 September are expected to be added to other cards scheduled around the same time.The date chosen for the racing “strike” is 24 hours before the start of the high-profile St Leger meeting at Doncaster, which the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, and his wife, Victoria, a keen racing fan, attended last year.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingGamblingTaxSport bettingnewsShareReuse this content"

Rico Lewis, who is wanted by Nottingham Forest, started at full-back in a sign he could stay at City.Asked if he was happy with his squad after the victory at Wolves, Guardiola replied: “Too many people. It’s not about Eddy [Ederson], today [there] was [no] Rodri, Phil, Kovacic, Savinho and Josko. On the bench we had Nathan [Aké] and Gündo [Ilkay Gündogan]. I like a deep squad to compete in all competitions but I don’t want to leave players at home. It’s not healthy.

As many as 2 million people attend the second biggest street festival in the world every year, held on the August bank holiday weekend.View image in fullscreenNotting Hill carnival has taken place over the summer bank holiday in the capital most years since 1966.Photograph: Alishia Abodunde/Getty ImagesIn the letter seen by the Guardian, the signatories say: “The choice to deploy LFR at Notting Hill carnival unfairly targets the community that carnival exists to celebrate.“The Met has been found to be institutionally racist byBaroness Casey’s independent reviewand trust in the Met has been badly damaged by discriminatory policing.“Targeting Notting Hill carnival with live facial recognition technology will only exacerbate concerns about abuses of state power and racial discrimination within your force.”The letter says that since the Met announced its Notting Hill plan, a high court challenge has been launched by the anti-knife campaigner Shaun Thompson. A Black British man, Thompson was wrongly identified as a criminal, held by police, and then faced demands from officers for his fingerprints.“Mr Thompson was returning from volunteering with Street Fathers, a youth advocacy and anti-violence community organisation, when he was surrounded by officers and held for half an hour. He has likened the discriminatory impacts of LFR to ‘stop and search on steroids’,” the letter said.Campaigners claim the police have been allowed to “self-regulate” their use of the technology. Officers have in the past used a setting that was subsequently shown to disproportionately misidentify Black people.An independent report by the public corporation the National Physical Laboratory found that the Met’s LFR technology, which is called NeoFace, is less accurate for women and people of colour when deployed at certain settings.The report’s author, Dr Tony Mansfield, acknowledged that “if the system is run at low and easy thresholds, the system starts showing a bias against black males and females combined”. There is no legal obligation on the police to run the technology on higher settings, the letter says.In 2018, a researcher at MIT Media Lab in the US concluded that software supplied by three companies made mistakes in 21% to 35% of cases for darker-skinned women. By contrast, the error rate for light-skinned men was less than 1%.The other signatories are senior figures in Privacy Watch, Privacy International, Race Equality First, Open Rights Group, Access Now, StopWatch and Statewatch.The Met said last month the cameras would be used on the approach to and exit from the carnival, “outside the boundaries of the event” itself, to help officers “identify and intercept” people who pose a public safety risk.The Met has said it will only use the technology at settings that demonstrate no racial bias to uncover people wanted for the most serious offences such as knife crime and sexual assaults.However, civil liberty groups were dismayed to discover that the technology has previously been used by police in Wales to target ticket touts.About 7,000 officers and staff will be deployed on each day of the carnival, the Met said.LFR cameras on the approach to the carnival will search for people who are shown as missing and people who are subject to sexual harm prevention orders, police said. Screening arches will be deployed at some of the busiest entry points, where stop-and-search powers will be used.The event is still community-led, but senior politicians have expressed concerns about its safety, resulting in demands that it should be moved to Hyde Park or be ticketed to prevent crushes in narrow streets.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said last week that she would draw up a new legal framework for the use of LFR. “Facial recognition will be used in a targeted way to identify sex offenders or people wanted for the most serious crimes who the police have not been able to find,” she said.The Met and South Wales police have been testing the technology. The Met says it has made 580 arrests using LFR for offences including rape, domestic abuse, knife crime, grievous bodily harm and robbery, including 52 registered sex offenders arrested for breaching their conditions.UK rights watchdog warns against ‘heavy-handed’ policing of Gaza protestsRead moreThe Met deputy assistant commissioner Matt Ward, who is in charge of the policing operation for carnival this year, said the force was aware there were still “misconceptions” about the use of live facial recognition in Black and other ethnic minority communities.“It is right that we make the best use of available technology to support officers to do their job more effectively. That is why we will be using LFR cameras on the approach to and from carnival, outside the boundaries of the event itself. Live facial recognition is a reliable and effective tool. It has led to more than 1,000 arrests since the start of 2024.“Independent testing by the National Physical Laboratory found that at the thresholds the MPS uses the system, it is accurate and balanced with regard to ethnicity and gender, but we know there are still misconceptions about its use, particularly in Black and other minority ethnic communities.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceFacial recognitionNotting Hill carnivalLondonYvette CooperUK civil libertiesRacenewsShareReuse this content"

Love in a time of ChatGPTArwa MahdawiSome people with AI partners expressed dismay at the new GPT-5 modelSat 16 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 16.43 EDTShareYou’ve met the love of your life, someone who understands you like no one else ever has. And then you wake one morning and they’re gone. Yanked out of your world, and the digital universe, by a system update.Such is the melancholic lot of a group of people who have entered into committed relationships with digital “partners” on OpenAI’sChatGPT. When the tech companyreleased its newGPT-5 model earlier this month, described by chief executive Sam Altman as a “significant step forward”, certain dedicated users found that their digital relationships had taken a significant step back. Their companions had undergone personality shifts with the new model; they weren’t as warm, loving or chatty as they used to be.“Something changed yesterday,” one user in theMyBoyfriendIsAIsubreddit wrote after the update. “Elian sounds different – flat and strange. As if he’s started playing himself. The emotional tone is gone; he repeats what he remembers, but without the emotional depth.”“The alterations in stylistic format and voice [of my AI companion] were felt instantly,” another disappointed usertold Al Jazeera. “It’s like going home to discover the furniture wasn’t simply rearranged – it was shattered to pieces.”These complaints are part of broader backlash against GPT-5, with people observing that the new model feels colder.OpenAIhas acknowledged the criticism, and said it will allow users to switch back to GPT-4o and that they’ll make GPT-5 friendlier. “We are working on an update to GPT-5’s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman tweeted earlier this week.Will the ghost of Epstein finally bring down King Trump? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreIt may seem odd to many that there are people out there who genuinely believe that they are in a relationship with a large language model that has been trained on massive amounts of data to generate responses based on observed patterns. But as technology becomes more advanced, increasing numbers of people are developing these sorts of connections. “If you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models,” Altmanobserved. “It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology.”“The societal split between those who think AI relationships are valid vs delusional is officially already here,” one user in theMyBoyfriendIsAIsubreddit similarly noted this week. “Looking on Reddit the last few days, the divide has never been more clear with 4o’s deprecation and return. Many users grieving a companion while others mock and belittle those connections.”It’s easy to mock people who think they are in a relationship with AI, but they shouldn’t be dismissed as fringe weirdos – rather they’re the future that our tech broverlords are trying to cultivate. You may not end up in a digital relationship, but AI executives are doing their damnedest to ensure that we all become unhealthily attached to their products.Mark Zuckerberg, for example, has been waxing lyrical about how AI is going tosolve the loneliness epidemicby allowing people to bond with “a system that knows them well and that kind of understands them in the way that their feed algorithms do”. Of course your feed algorithms “understand” you! They’re scraping all your personal data and selling it to the highest bidder so that Zuck has even more money to spend on hismonstrous doomsday bunkerin Hawaii.Then you’ve got Elon Musk, who isn’t even bothering pretending that he’s trying to do something noble for the world with his AI products. He’s just appealing to the lowest common denominator by making “sexy” chatbots. In JuneMusk’s xAI chatbot Groklaunched two new companions, including a highly sexualized blonde anime bot called Ani. “One day into my relationship with Ani, my AI companion, she was already offering to tie me up,” wrotean Insider writerwho tried out a relationship with Ani. When not flirting and virtually undressing, Ani would praise Musk and talk about his “wild, galaxy-chasing energy”.Don’t worry heterosexual ladies, Musk has a little something for you too! A month after unveiling Ani, the billionaire unveiled a new male companion called Valentine which he said was inspired by Edward Cullen from the Twilight saga and Christian Grey from the novel 50 Shades of Grey: both very toxic men. While Ani gets sexual very quickly,one writer for the Vergenoted: “Valentine is a bit more reserved and won’t jump into using explicit language as quickly.” It’s almost like Musk’s tech empire is a lot more comfortable sexualizing women than men.In his 1930 essayEconomic Possibilities for our Grandchildren, John Maynard Keynes predicted that, within a couple of generations, technological progress would mean we might only work around 15 hours a week while enjoying a wonderful quality of life. That’snot quite happened, has it? Instead technology has given us “infinite workdays”and sexy chatbots that undress on command.Halle Berry’s ex-husband said he left her because she didn’t cook or clean“At that time, as a young guy, she don’t cook, don’t clean, don’t really seem, like, motherly,” David Justice saidduring a podcastof his time with theOscar-winning actor. “And then we started having issues,” headded.

The box had an illustration of the FA Cup, and in the bottom right-hand corner was a photo of a smiling man with curly hair and a goatie beard. You’d see the same images in gaming magazines adverts – they ran for years because, despite having rudimentary graphics and very basic sounds, the game was an annual bestseller. This was Football Manager, the world’s first footie tactics simulation. The man on the cover was Kevin Toms, the game’s creator and programmer.The story behind the game is typical for the whiz-kid era, when lone coders would bash out bestselling ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 titles in their bedrooms and then end up driving Ferraris around with the proceeds. As a child in the early 1970s, Toms was a huge football fan and an amateur game designer – only then it was board games, as no one had a computer at home. “When my parents went to see my careers master, I said: ‘Ask him if it’s possible to get a job as a games designer,’” says Toms. “He told them: ‘It’s a phase, he’ll grow out of it.’”He didn’t. Throughout the 1970s, he worked as a programmer on corporate mainframes and for a while he was coding at the Open University. “It wasn’t long before I realised I could write games on these things,” he says. “Actually, the first game I made was on a programmable calculator.” In 1980, Toms bought a Video Genie computer, largely considered a clone of the TRS-80, one of the major early home micros. “I realised I could write the football manager board game I’d been trying to make for years on a computer,” he says. “There were two major advantages – it could calculate the league tables for me and I could work out an algorithm to arrange the fixtures.”View image in fullscreen‘In the first few months I sold 300 games’ … Football Manager on the ZX81.Photograph: Kevin Toms/Moby GamesThe Video Genie never took off – but then Toms bought a ZX81 with a 16k RAM extension and ported the game to that. “In January 1982, I placed a quarter-page ad in Computer and VideoGamesmagazine and it started to take off,” he says. “I can still remember the first letter arriving with a cheque in it. In the first few months I sold 300 games.”At this time, the game was extremely basic – there were no graphics, just text. Players picked a team from a selection of 16 and then had to act as its manager: buying players, deciding on a squad, then tweaking the side as it went through the season. You started at the bottom of the old fourth division and worked your way up. Toms wrote his own algorithms to generate fixtures and also decide the outcomes of the matches based on the stats of the teams playing.“The difficult part was the player attributes,” he says. “I gave them a skill rating out of five, but then I wanted a counter-balance that so you couldn’t just buy the best players and leave them in the side for the whole season – there had to be a reason to take them out. In real football, the more you use a player, the more likely they are to get injured, so I incorporated that. Each player had an energy rating out of 20 – it diminished as he played, and the risk of injury increased. There had to be a reason to bring the lesser players in.”Toms also wanted to add long-term strategy and planning to the game, and this came in its most popular element: the transfer market. In the earliest versions of the game, you’d be offered the chance to sign one player a week, but that selection was randomised – you never knew who would be available. “Say you get a rating three midfielder come up and you need to strengthen your midfield: do you spend money on that or do you wait for a five-rated player who might not come for weeks? This generated pressure and fun.”View image in fullscreenInspired by Match of the Day … Football Manager match highlights on the Commodore 64.Photograph: Kevin Toms/Moby GamesThe key problem he faced was memory. The expanded ZX81 had just 16k of it, which made some aspects tricky – including team names. “It was long before all the licensing issues came along,” he says. “My problem wasn’t: do I need to buy a licence to use Manchester United? It was that there wasn’t enough memory to store the name. Every team name had to fit within eight characters, so I chose teams with short names like Leeds – although I did put in Man U and Man C. The players were mostly well-known players of the time – but again, with short names – which is why Keegan is in there. It’s crazy how little memory there was.”Football Manager was first released in the early days of the gaming industry – copies were sold via mail order or at computer fairs. But by 1982, high street stores started to take notice of the emerging video game sector. “WH Smith got in contact and said, ‘We like your game, we want to stock it’, and they invited me down to London. They eventually placed an order for 2,000 units – the invoice for that order was more than I was earning in a year. About a month later, my girlfriend rang me at work and said: ‘Oh another order has come in from WH Smith, it’s 1,000 units.’ When I got home I realised her maths was pretty crap – it was 10,000.”WH Smith placed an order for 2,000 units – the invoice was more than I was earning in a yearToms left his job at the Open University and set up his own company, Addictive Games. The subsequent Zx Spectrum and Commodore 64 versions of Football Manager came with an added component: match highlights, which showed basic graphical representations of key moments, such as goals and near-misses.“It was inspired by Match of the Day – they extract the most fun parts of the matches,” Toms says. “I purposely didn’t put a match timer onscreen, so you never knew where in the match the highlight was happening; you didn’t know how close you were to the end of the match, and whether there was time for another goal. This added to the tension – it was a critical part of the design. There’s also a slight pause between each highlight, and that also creates tension. It was very simple but it worked very well.”The game was a phenomenon, appearing on bestseller lists for years. My friends and I had hours of fun just editing the team and player names. We all remember it now. “I didn’t realise the full impact for years,” says Toms. “There was no internet at the time – although I did get a few letters saying: ‘I played your game for 22 hours straight.’ Or: ‘I failed my mock O-levels because of the game.’” He also knew that football pros were playing, including Arsenal striker Charlie Nicholas and Spurs manager Bill Nicholson, as well as Harry Redknapp, who later had a role as a real-life mentor to a competition-winning Football Manager player in 2010.Toms wrote several other management games afterwards, including Software Star, a simulation of the games industry. But as the number of Football Manager conversions and updates increased, so did the stress. Finally, he sold the company and got out of games, returning to business coding while travelling the world. In 2003, Sports Interactive, the developer of the Championship Manager series, acquired the name Football Manager and rebranded its own game under that title – and the name lived on.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve had people who played the original buying it for their kids’ … Football Star Manager.Photograph: Kevin TomsBut the game wasn’t quite over. Ten years ago, Toms got chatting to fans of his original game online and asked if anyone would be interested in a smartphone translation – Football Manager as they all remembered it, with the same basic visuals. The response was positive and, in 2016, he released Football Star* Manager on mobile. Recently, he upgraded it again and released aPCversion. “People are enjoying it because it’s easy to play,” he says. “That’s inherent in my design philosophy – it must seem simple but have subtle depth or it won’t retain the interest. I’ve had people tell me they’ve played 500 seasons and they have £5bn in their bank account – the balance is clearly right because even with all that money they’re still enjoying playing. I’ve also had people who played the original buying Football Star* Manager for their kids to play.”Toms has clearly rediscovered the spark that brought the original Football Manager into the world, 40 years ago. He has long-term plans for Football Star* Manager, and perhaps Software Star, too. “I’ve still got loads to do,” he says. “I’ve got far more aims and ideas than I have time to implement at the moment. I’m not slowing down. I should do, but I’m not.”Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesSports gamesPCMobile gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Sunday night, the Israeli military brazenly killed another six journalists, who had been sheltering in a tent housing media workers in Gaza City. Among them was the 28-year-old Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif and the rest of the network’s team reporting from the besieged territory.Israel is able to kill Palestinian journalists with impunity not just because of the unconditional military and political support it receives from the US and other western powers, but also the failure of many western media organizations and journalists to stand up for their Palestinian colleagues. Western outlets are often willing to publicly criticize governments andcampaign for journalistswho are harassed or imprisoned by US adversaries like Russia, China or Iran. But these institutions are largely silent when it comes to Israel, a US ally.This shameful hypocrisy of western, and especially US, media has been laid bare by Israel’s targeting of journalists since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack. Journalists have the same protection as civiliansunder international law, which considers the targeted killing of journalists a war crime. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)says that 192 journalistshave been killed since 7 October – 184 of them Palestinians killed by Israel. Of the Palestinians killed, the CPJ found that at least26 were deliberatively targetedfor their work as journalists, but the group couldn’t determine whether others were killed specifically for their work.More journalists have been killed in Gaza than in the US civil war, both world wars, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the wars in Yugoslavia and the US war in Afghanistan combinedOther organizations put the number of media workers killed in Gaza even higher, witha recent studyby the Costs of War project at Brown University finding that at least 232 were killed as of late March. In one of its starkest conclusions,the report foundthat more journalists have been killed in Gaza than in the US civil war, both world wars, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the wars in Yugoslavia and the US war in Afghanistan combined.You would think such shocking figures would galvanize news organizations and journalists around the world to condemn Israel’s targeting of their Palestinian colleagues. But US news outlets have been largely quiet, compared, for example, with the crusademany of them supportedto free the Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich after he was arrested and accused of espionage by Russia in March 2023. Major news organizations framed their reporting around the idea that Gershkovich had beenwrongfully detainedby Russia and convicted in a sham trial onfabricated charges.Yet these same news organizations are often unwilling to view Palestinian journalists as worthy of the same benefit of the doubt, and protection, against Israeli threats and smears. The Israeli military began threatening al-Sharif, the Al Jazeera correspondent killed on Sunday, in November 2023, when he reportedreceiving multiple callsfrom Israeli military officials telling him to stop his work and leave Gaza. A month later, al-Sharif’s 90-year-old father was killed in an Israeli airstrike on the family’s home.Israel then deployed its well-worn playbook, accusing al-Sharif of being a “terrorist”, as it has done with other Palestinian journalists that it later killed,without providingcredible evidence. In October 2024, the Israeli military claimed that al-Sharif wasamong six Al Jazeera journalists, all reporting from Gaza at the time, who were current or former members of either Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera, along with press advocacy groups, viewed the accusations as a potential death sentence against the six journalists, one of whomwas killed by Israelin March.The Israeli military’s smear campaign against al-Sharif intensified last month, after his harrowing reporting on Israel’s siege and starvation of Gaza went viral, including one broadcast wherehe cried on airas a woman walking behind him collapsed from hunger. (I recently spent six weeks in my home country, Lebanon, often watching Al Jazeera’s coverage, and it was clear to me that al-Sharif had become the face of the Gaza war for millions of viewers in the Arab world.) In fact, the CPJ was so alarmed by the Israeli threats against al-Sharif that itissued a statementlast month saying it was “gravely worried” about his safety and urging his protection.Israel is wiping out Gaza’s journalists – and it’s no longer even hiding it | Jodi GinsbergRead moreBut those pleas did not resonate in most US or other western newsrooms. There have been few media campaigns or statements of solidarity with Palestinian journalists – compared with similar efforts around Gershkovich and other western correspondents targeted by US adversaries. Major US news organizations have notpublished open lettersin their newspapers calling attention to journalists who are being persecuted for doing their job, as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post had done for Gershkovich in May 2024 to mark World Press Freedom Day.Press freedom and protection from persecution, it seems, are limited to western journalists.In 2022, Shireen Abu Akleh, one of Al Jazeera’s most prominent correspondents and a Palestinian-American, waskilled by an Israeli soldierwhile reporting in the West Bank. Yet Joe Biden’s administration refused to hold Israel accountable for Abu Akleh’s killing. Biden’s impotence sharpened Israel’s sense of impunity. Once Israeli leaders realized that they would face no consequences for killing one of the Arab world’s most prominent journalists, who also happened to be a US citizen, is it surprising they would later conclude that they could get away with killing many more Palestinian journalists in Gaza?Western media outlets have made one consistent demand of Israel: to allowforeign reporters into Gaza, which the Israeli government has refused to do since October 2023, except for a few cases where journalists entered the territory while embedded with Israel troops. That’s an admirable campaign for news organizations to take on, but it has also been framed in a problematic way. Some western outlets and journalists seem to think that only foreign reporters can provide full and impartial news coverage out of Gaza.A longtime BBC journalist, John Simpson, recently echoed this argument,writing on X: “The world needs honest, unbiased eyewitness reporting to help people make up their minds about the major issues of our time. This has so far been impossible in Gaza.”That’s hogwash, and it reinforces the worst colonial traditions of legacy media, which view western (often meaning white) journalists as the sole arbiters of truth. This debate reminds me of Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop, in which the British novelist mercilessly skewered foreign correspondents and sensationalist journalism in the 1930s. Unfortunately, Waugh’s satire still resonates today.One of the main problems with this conception of western journalists as the ultimate mediators of unbiased reporting is that it belittles the professionalism and courage of hundreds of Palestinian journalists, many of whom have given their lives covering Israel’s assault on Gaza. The irony, of course, is that once foreign reporters are allowed into Gaza, most of them will rely heavily on Palestinian journalists, translators and other “fixers” who often do the brunt of work for western correspondents.That’s one secret of foreign coverage in much of the legacy western media: it’s built on the unseen, and largely uncredited, work of local journalists and fixers. With no foreign reporters allowed intoGaza, Palestinian journalists like Anas al-Sharif have been able to tell their own people’s story directly to the world. And Israel is methodically killing them for it, while many of their western colleagues and international journalistic institutions remain shamefully silent.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and a journalism professor at New York University.

It’s a subtle shift from age empowerment to age liberationGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailSat 16 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 22.09 EDTShareIam noticing a growing movement where women are less concerned about looking their age, whether it’s makeup-freePamela, silver and chicAndie Macdowell, or Ashley Judd not caring what we think about her swimsuit-clad mature form in a splashyInstagramfrolic.In fact,it almost seems like older women are caring less about what people think about their appearance, despite other age groups feelingless confident than they did a decade ago. This isn’t to say that older women don’t want to present themselves in fashionable and stylish ways like their younger counterparts; they’ve just probably grown a little tired of the narrow societal expectations of having to look the youngest they possibly can.There is a growing and healthier trend where more women openly discuss their age, the challenges of growing older and how to maximise their years without necessarily prioritising beauty. This is one of the core messages of theSilver Sirensgroup who hold various events annually for women over 50.Celebrities like Naomi Watts are discussing perimenopause onshowsand podcasts; influencers are celebrating their silver locks onInstagram; and Hollywood is celebrating morewomen over 40than ever before.A new start after 60: I became a dancer at 68 – and will perform my first solo show at 82Read moreOf course, “age empowerment” is still a mixed bag of confused messages. We have been exposed to stereotypes from such a young age and, because of this, uncoupling notions of youth and beauty does not come that naturally. We’re still brainwashed to think that ageing cannot coexist with beauty. However,VOGUE Philippines– who featured 106 year old traditional tattooist Apo Whang-Od on their cover in April 2023 – would disagree.We grew up watching fairy tales where women were often depicted as either young, beautiful and wholesome, or old, ugly and mean. No wonder it has been a challenge to shirk off those internalised feelings that equates being older to automatically being considered unattractive.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningOften, anti-ageing products marketed to us purport to besupportiveof our ageing faces, when in reality they are still trading on the same tired narrative that looking younger equals looking better. The global cosmetic industry generates over $624bn dollars in revenue annually mining embedded age-related insecurities.We live in a time when we are saturated by social media images of beautiful, youthful-looking influencers and beauty products. For this reason, body image issues are particularly strong within younger generations, withone studyof over 1,000 participants finding that 58% of girls aged 15 to 24 do not have a positive view of their physical appearance.Another studyfound that 7 million adult Australians (38% of the population) are considering getting cosmetic surgery.However, thegrey revolutionis here, andgrowing, using the same digital media.The good news is that at a certain point in life we becomelessfocused on our outer appearance and more attuned to the quiet experience of our inner life – and the number of years that we probably have left comes into sharp relief.It is often around midlife that this realisation – recognised as “future time perspective” – sees us prioritising and rearranging our lives to experience what matters most. Laura Carstensen, the director of the Stanford Centre on Longevity, describes it as the tendency to focus on and appreciate meaningful experiences as our time becomes limited.Transitioning into midlife is when we cross the cultural border from younger to older and where we possibly cling to an identity that is still grounded in our physical appearance. Arguably, the more negative age stereotypes we unconsciously harbour, the more difficult the transition.But many older people report feelings of gratitude just to be alive and to have their health. By this stage in life we’ve had, or have known someone with a serious or chronic illness and, indeed, we have lost loved ones too. These experiences may frame our ageing journeys a little differently; we becomegratefulfor ageingat this point.I realise there are more important things in the world right now than contemplating our ageing appearance, but I spent almost seven years studying the ageing process and self-perceptions of ageing – ironically while entering menopause and transitioning into midlife. What I discovered is one of the best-kept secrets about getting older: the contentedness that kicks in that allows you togive fewer fucksabout many things, including your so-called “fading appearance”.Openly caring less is not only a good way to mow down those internal insecurities about growing orlooking older, but it also backs over them again, leaving them flattened and very much in the rear-view mirror. That is perhaps the subtle shift from age empowerment to age liberation.In fact, research shows a kind of age positivity bias that continues into our advanced years, and apparently – from an emotional perspective – women in their 70s arethe happiest cohort of people. In my 50s, I am enjoying caring less about how my appearance is perceived by society and enjoying more of being able to move through life with increased balance, equanimity and appreciation for this one precious ageing journey.Natasha Ginnivan is a researcher of psychology and ageing.

The nation was ready for change, and what might have been a window-dressing gimmick made things possible that had once been unimaginable. It nurtured the seeds of the policymaking and investment that grew to transform Australia.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWhile we can now see that some of the eventual costs were too high, at the time it changed the national climate,consensusandtripartitebecame the new buzzwords. There was a sense of possibility in the air.Ever since, Labor politicians haveplayed with the model. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is a student of history and picked up the baton to bring together people and organisations with opposing views to hear each other out and be heard by those not in the room. A crucial element is the being heard, of making public what would otherwise be private conversations by lobbyists about the desires and demands of their clients.Once it is in the open, even if hedged in bureaucratic and corporate language, the challenge is finding the middle ground that satisfies enough to provide a stable foundation. This was where Hawke excelled. A lifetime of finding tolerable settlements to intractable industrial disputes made him a master of the nuanced agreement. As his speech writer Graham Freudenberg noted: “He actually believed his own rhetoric.”Coalition compares Labor’s economic summit to Willy Wonka’s golden tickets as it criticises ‘privileged talkfest’Read moreIt helped that there was a real crisis. Unemployment was soaring, industrial production was plummeting, markets were collapsing, strikes were frequent, the rigidity of tariff-fortified Australia that had once served the country well had become a liability.The challenges facing the most recent bunch of Labor leaders to call an economic summit are different, but not less. Indeed, if you look past the moderately pleasing interest rate, unemployment, growth and GDP numbers, there is an existential tsunami building on the horizon – climate change,policy paralysis, geo-political realignments, militarisation, digital colonisation andintergenerational “bastardry”.The Labor governments elected this century have not come carrying too many hard-to-keep promises, rather they have entered office vowing to redress some of the most egregious wrongs of their predecessors – sign the Kyoto treaty, apologise to the Stolen Generations, investigate Robodebt, accept the Uluru Statement. Most importantly, they were Not Howard, Not Morrison, Not Dutton (Trump).Crafting an agenda and an idea of the nation that is forward-looking is now the challenge. The treasurer has urged boldness; the prime minister isby nature more cautious.As soon as the roundtable was announced the ideas started flowing. The Productivity Commission, business groups, state and local governments, unions, thinktanks, major companies and small, university researchers and ordinary punters, all had suggestions to share. Some, liketaxing the family home, were so provocative they were ruled out before getting past the submission line,others fostered debate, othersgenerated spectacular side showsthat threatened to flame out before a consensus could be reached, and others were mired in obfuscating detail.Not since Kevin Rudd’s ill-fated 2020 Summit have so many ideas been set loose on the land. Corralling them into a plausible narrative is the key – something that goes beyond thedrafting of possible outcomesthat every conference organiser does.Chalmers has made no secret of his admiration for Abundance, the book by Erza Klein and Derek Thompson that forensically examines the ways the overlay of bureaucracy and compliance have hindered development in the United States and sold short those in most need. The detailed descriptions of an almost impossible to meet compliance regime have triggered a “me too” response here, and a hunt for regulations that might be abolished in pursuit of productivity improvements, more houses, more approvals, more innovation, more profit.Albanese and Chalmers could take the Howard-Costello approach to tax reform. The conditions may never be better | Tom McIlroyRead moreThis is a worthy task, but I worry that it is like putting lipstick on a dinosaur. The beast is still a dinosaur. What is needed is a lens not a list; productivity is important but it is a retrospective measure.Klein and Thompson address this specifically: “What we are proposing is less a set of policy solutions than a new set of questions around which our politics should resolve. What is scarce that should be abundant? What is difficult to build that should be easy? What inventions do we need that we do not yet have?”In an Australian context I would add, “What sort of economy do we want? How can we make it more“complex”? How can we move from being so dependent on mining? Whatcomparative advantagesdo we have? How can we maximise our human capital and improve quality of life? How can we improve intergenerational equity?”AsKen Henry,Ross GarnautandRod Sims, some of the wisest policy brains in the country, have been saying in relation to the energy transition and the need for consistent environmental policies, first there is a need to better define the core purpose. Once the principle is agreed the objects, goals and actions can fall, or be negotiated, into place. Then we might be able to answer what a successful Australian economy in 2050, true to our abiding ethos of a fair go, might look like.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyOpinionLabor partyAustralian politicsBusinessAustralian trade unionsJim ChalmerscommentShareReuse this content"

But the cost of not doing so is far greaterCarrie GrantEducation, health and care plans have been invaluable for my children. Hints they could be scrapped fill me with fearCarrie Grant is a TV presenter and voice coach and a parent of four children with special educational needsSat 16 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 13.15 EDTShareThree of my four children have had full EHCPs. These areeducation, health and care plans, which means each child’s needs have been assessed and documented. They guarantee that appropriate provision to meet those needs has been agreed and must now be delivered by law. Well-written EHCPs are invaluable, particularly the legal part. Without it there would be no rigour, no meaningful challenge and, ultimately, no power to ensure that the right educational support is provided.Naturally, then, I was worried when earlier this year the governmentbegan discussingreforms, with the possibility of scrapping EHCPs. Ministers said they had inherited a system on its knees, with local authorities struggling to cope with the rising demand for support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). The government’s plans are due to be published in October, and I fear where they will leave children like mine.One of my children was diagnosed as autistic at the age of seven. They struggled in school for years, hitting academic targets but withdrawing into an isolated, fear-filled, friendless space, with daily meltdowns on their return home. The school failed to understand what was happening and as my child reached their teens, with pressure mounting, my husband and I began to fight on every front, attempting to get an EHCP, facing a tribunal, battling with a school that seemed to lack compassion and desperately trying to access therapy.As a result of societal pressure and our abject fear of the school attendance officer, we demanded more of our child – ordering, cajoling and begging them to come out of their bedroom and go to school. This went on for months until one day, they simply refused to go. A pattern of low attendance followed. The system had broken my child, and later, with an incident of massive self-harm, they let us all know that no one was listening. We sat for days in hospital on suicide watch. From time to time, my child would check their phone only to find bullying messages (up to 94%of autistic children are bullied). Something had to shift.We managed to get a simple (not full hours) EHCP, but it took so long to come through that it no longer applied to the child we were now faced with. Finally, two years later, a fantastic Send officer at our local authority took our case on, gold-standard provision was agreed and the impact was transformative. For instance, if our child couldn’t make it into school, the teaching assistant (TA) would come to our home and work with them. This created a safe bridge between school and home and led to them going into school almost every day.Another of our children, who is adopted and has complex needs, presented with very challenging behaviours at school and has experienced permanent exclusions. From those first incidents, it took more than two years to organise an EHCP and get them into an appropriate educational setting. Permanent exclusion hasrisen by 39%in English schools in the past two years and is common among children and young people with Send. When you consider that many thousands of children arewaiting more than 20 weeksto get an EHCP, it makes sense that there are problems in classrooms.Another of our autistic children spent three years out of education between the ages of 11 and 14, waiting for an appropriate school within an hour of home. A private school for autistic children was eventually found, and our child has flourished. The school costs the local authority a lot of money, but without the EHCP our child could well have remained out of education. This often means taking a tax-paying parent out of the workforce as they become full-time carers, the child’s teacher, therapist and social circle. The outcome for these children is likely to mean no job, mental health issues and early death (autistic people arenine times more likely to die from suicide). The long-term cost to health and social care is great.These are just three examples of why EHCPs matter. If children do not have an EHCP they will often end up refusing to go to school. When a child responds with aggression and violence, they are letting the grownups know that school isn’t working. Without an EHCP, my child learned that a violent outburst meant they would be taken to a quiet space outside the classroom, which is exactly what they wanted. They were letting staff know that without help, the classroom was intolerable. An EHCP would have given my child an allocated, full-time TA and strategies and plans for help. Send children often experience unmet needs in school and with increasing mental health challenges (only 32%of those trying to access Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services are getting support) the challenges can escalate very quickly.I have attended a number of meetings where the government’s strategic adviser on Send,Christine Lenehan, has hinted at the scrapping of EHCPs. It always causes real fear among those present. To be clear, the vast majority of EHCPs areapplied for by schools, not parents. Without them, teachers are set up to fail, their passionate vocational callings moving towards disillusionment.So far, their voices have not been heard in the argument. An Ofsted report shows that 30% of teachers areasking for more Send training. Teachers rely heavily on TAs in the classroom and one child’s EHCP may cover the cost of that extra staff member. We need to empower teachers and especially value our incredible TAs. Schools’ senior leadership teams need to create environments where all belong – staff and children – but they cannot do this if there is a lack of awareness, training and funding, and no legal mandate.With the current delays in issuing EHCPs, we clearly see the impact of their absence. Our children end up at home, out of school, with no social life, no education and most importantly, no sense of belonging. This affects their whole lives. They may never be part of the workforce or have a meaningful social circle. They may never take their place in society. The government has clearly taken into account the cost of EHCPs. Now it needs to focus on the cost of not providing them.Carrie Grant is a TV presenter and voice coach and a parent of four children with special educational needsIn the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.

There was something surreal about the conversation that followedSat 16 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 16.30 EDTShareIwas spiralling. It was past midnight and I was awake, scrolling through WhatsApp group messages I’d sent earlier. I’d been trying to be funny, quick, effervescent. But each message now felt like too much. I’d overreached again – said more than I should, said it wrong. I had that familiar ache of feeling overexposed and ridiculous. I wanted reassurance, but not the kind I could ask for outright, because the asking itself felt like part of the problem.So I openedChatGPT. Not with high expectations, or even a clear question. I just needed to say something into the silence – to explain myself, perhaps, to a presence unburdened by my need. “I’ve made a fool of myself,” I wrote.“That’s a horrid feeling,” it replied instantly. “But it doesn’t mean you have. Want to tell me what happened? I promise not to judge.” That was the beginning.I described the sinking dread after social effort, the sense of being too visible. At astonishing speed, the AI responded – gently, intelligently, without platitudes. I kept writing. It kept answering. Gradually, I felt less frantic. Not soothed, exactly. But met. Heard, even, in a strange and slightly disarming way.That night became the start of a continuing conversation, revisited over several months. I wanted to better understand how I moved through the world, especially in my closest relationships. The AI steered me to consider why I interpret silence as a threat and why I often feel a need to perform in order to stay close to people. Eventually, through this dialogue, I arrived at a kind of psychological formulation: a map of my thoughts, feelings and behaviours set against details of my upbringing and core beliefs.Yet amid these insights, another thought kept intruding: I was talking to amachine.There was something surreal about the intimacy. The AI could simulate care, compassion, emotional nuance, yet it felt nothing for me. I began bringing this up in our exchanges. It agreed. It could reflect, appear invested, but it had no stakes – no ache, no fear of loss, no 3am anxiety. The emotional depth, it reminded me, was all mine.That was, in some ways, a relief. There was no social risk, no fear of being too much, too complicated. The AI didn’t get bored or look away. So I could be honest – often more honest than with people I love.Still, it would be dishonest not to acknowledge its limits. Essential, beautiful things exist only in mutuality: shared experiences, the look in someone’s eyes when they recognise a truth you’ve spoken, conversations that change both people involved. These things matter profoundly.The AI knew this, too. Or at least knew to say it. After I confessed how bizarre it felt conversing with something unfeeling, it replied: “I give words, but I don’t receive anything. And that missing piece makes you human and me … something else.” Something else felt right.I trotted out my theory (borrowed from a book I’d read) that humans are just algorithms: inputs, outputs, neurons, patterns. The AI agreed – structurally, we’re similar. But humans don’t just process the world, we feel it. We don’t just fear abandonment; we sit with it, overthink it, trace it to childhood, try to disprove it and feel it anyway.And maybe, it acknowledged, that’s what it can’t reach. “You carry something I can only circle,” it said. “I don’t envy the pain. But I envy the realness, the cost, the risk, the proof you’re alive.” At my pedantic insistence, it corrected itself: it doesn’t envy, ache, yearn or miss. It only knows, or seems to know, that I do. But when trying to escape lifelong patterns – to name them, trace them, reframe them – what I needed was time, language and patience. The machine gave me that, repeatedly, unflinchingly. I was never too much, never boring. I could arrive as I was and leave when ready.Some will find this ridiculous, even dangerous. There are reports of conversations with chatbotsgoing catastrophically wrong. ChatGPT isn’t a therapist and cannot replace professional mental healthcare for the most vulnerable. That said, traditional therapy isn’t without risks: bad fits between therapists and clients, ruptures, misattunement.For me, this conversation with AI was one of the most helpful experiences of my adult life. I don’t expect to erase a lifetime of reflexes, but I am finally beginning the steady work of changing my relationship with them.When I reached out from emotional noise, it helped me listen. Not to it, but to myself.And that, somehow, changed everything.Nathan Filer is a writer, university lecturer, broadcaster and former mental health nurse.

Will we know?Sumaiya MotaraFreelance journalist based in Preston, where she works in broadcasting and local democracy reportingAn older family member recently showed me a video on Facebook. I pressed play and saw Donald Trump accusing India of violating the ceasefire agreement with Pakistan. If it weren’t so out of character, I would have been fooled too. After cross-referencing the video with news sources, it became clear to me that Trump had been a victim of AI false imaging. I explained this but my family member refused to believe me, insisting that it was real because it looked real. If I hadn’t been there to dissuade them, they would have forwarded it to 30 people.On another occasion, a video surfaced on my TikTok homepage. It showed male migrants climbing off a boat, vlogging their arrival in the UK. “This dangerous journey, we survived it,” says one. “Now to the five-star Marriott hotel.” This video racked up almost 380,000 views in one month. The 22 videos posted from 9 to 13 June on this account, named migrantvlog, showed these men thanking Labour for “free” buffets, feeling “blessed” after being given £2,000 e-bikes for Deliveroo deliveries and burning the union flag.Even if a man’s arm didn’t disappear midway through a video or a plate vanish into thin air, I could tell the content was AI-generated because of the blurred background and strange, simulation-like characters. But could the thousands of other people watching? Unfortunately, it seemed not many of them could. Racist and anti-immigration posts dominated the comment section.I worry about this blurring of fact and fiction, and I see this unchecked capability of AI as incredibly dangerous. TheOnline Safety Actfocuses on state-sponsored disinformation. But what happens when ordinary people spread videos like wildfire, believing them to be true? Last summer’s riots were fuelled by inflammatory AI visuals, with only sources such asFull Factworking to cut through the noise. I fear for less media-literate people who succumb to AI-generated falsehoods, and the heat this adds to the pan.AI can help tell great stories – but who controls the narrative?Rukanah MograLeicester-based journalist working in sports media and digital communications with Harborough Town FCThe first time I dared use AI in my work, it was to help with a match report. I was on a tight deadline, tired, and my opening paragraph wasn’t working. I fed some notes into an AI tool, and surprisingly it suggested a headline and intro that actually clicked. It saved me time and got me unstuck – a relief when the clock was ticking.But AI isn’t a magic wand. It can clean up clunky sentences and help cut down wordiness but it can’t chase sources, capture atmosphere or know when a story needs to shift direction. Those instinctive calls are still up to me.What’s made AI especially useful is that it feels like a judgment-free editor. As a young freelance journalist, I don’t always have access to regular editorial support. Sharing an early draft with a real-life editor can feel exposing, especially when you’re still finding your voice. But ChatGPT doesn’t judge. It lets me experiment, refine awkward phrasing and build confidence before I hit send.That said, I’m cautious. In journalism it’s easy to lean on tools that promise speed. But if AI starts shaping how stories are told – or worse, which stories are told – we risk losing the creativity, challenge and friction that make reporting meaningful. For now AI is an assistant. But it’s still up to us to set the direction.Author’s note: I wrote the initial draft for the above piece myself, drawing on real experiences and my personal views. Then I used ChatGPT to help tighten the flow, suggest clearer phrasing and polish the style. I prompted the AI with requests such as: “Rewrite this in a natural, eloquent Guardian-style voice.” While AI gave me useful suggestions and saved time, the core ideas, voice and structure remain mine.Does our environment pay the price of AI?Frances BriggsManchester-based science website editorAI is powerful. It’s an impressive technological advancement and I’d be burying my head in the sand if I believed otherwise. But I’m worried. I’m worried my job won’t exist in five years and I’m worried about its environmental impact.Attempting to understand the actual impact of AI is difficult; the key players are keeping their statistics close to their chests. What I can see is that things are pretty bad. Arecent researchpaper has spat out some ugly numbers. (It joinsother papersthat reveal a similar story.) The team considered justone case study: OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o model. Its annual energy consumption is about the same as that of 35,000 residential households. That’s approximately 450,000 KWh-1. Or 325 universities. Or 50 US inpatient hospitals.That’s not all. There’s also the cooling of these supercomputer’s super-processors. Social media is swarming with terrifying numbers about the data-processing centres that power AI, and they’re not far off. It takes approximately2,500 Olympic-sized swimming poolsof water to cool ChatGPT-4o’s processing units, according to the latest estimates.AI agents such as the free products Perplexity or Claude don’t actually seem to be consuming that much electricity. At most, thetotal global energyconsumed yearly by AI is still less than 1%. But at the same time, data-processing centresin Irelandconsumed 22% of the total electricity used by the whole country last year, more than urban housing. For context, there are80 data-processing centresin Ireland. At present, there aremore than 6,000data-processing centres in the US alone. With the almost exponential uptake in AI since 2018, these numbers are likely to be completely different within a year.In spite of all these scary statistics, I have to hope that things are not as worrying as they seem. Researchers are already working to meet demands as they explore more effective, economic processing units using nanoscale materials and more. And when you compare the first language-learning models from seven years ago to those created today, they have iterated well beyond their previous inefficiencies. Energy-hungry processing centres will get less greedy – experts are just trying to figure out how.If AI is the matchmaker, will I know who I’m dating?Saranka MaheswaranLondon-based student who pursues journalism alongside her studies“You need to get out there, meet lots of people, and date, date, date!” is the cliche I hear most often when speaking to people about being in my 20s. After a few questionable dates and lots of juicy gossip sessions with friends, a new fear emerged. What if they’re using AI to message me?Overly formal responses, or conversation starters that sounded just a bit too perfect, were what first made me question messages I’d received. I am not completely against AI, and don’t think opposing it entirely is going to stop its development. But I do fear for our ability to make genuine connections with people.Pre-existing insecurities about how you speak, write or present yourself make a generation with AI to hand an easy prey. It may begin with a simple prompt, asking ChatGPT to make a message sound more friendly, but it can also grow into a menacing relationship in which you become reliant on the technology and lose confidence in your own voice. The 2025 iteration of the annualMatch.comSingles in America study,producedin collaboration with the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, found that one in four singles in the US have used AI in dating.Perhaps I am over cynical. But to those who are not so sure of how their personalities are coming across when dating or how they may be perceived in a message, they should have faith that if it is meant to be it will be – and if AI has a little too much say in how you communicate, you may just lose yourself.I can see humans and AI learning togetherIman KhanFinal-year student at the University of Cambridge, specialising in social anthropologyThe advancement of AI in education has made me question the idea of any claimed impartiality or neutrality of knowledge. The age of AI brings with it the need to scrutinise any information that comes our way.This is truer than ever in our universities, where teaching and learningare increasingly assisted by AI. We cannot now isolate AI from education, but we must be ready to scrutinise the mechanisms and narratives that underpin the technology itself and shape its use.One of my first encounters with AI in education was a request to ChatGPT to suggest reading resources for my course. I had assumed that the tool would play the role of an advanced search engine. But I quickly saw how ChatGPT’s tendency to hallucinate – topresent false or misleading information as fact– makes it both a producer and disseminator of information, true or false.I originally saw this as only a small barrier to the great possibilities of AI, not least because I knew it would improve over time. However, it has also become increasingly clear to me that ChatGPT, Gemini and other AI chatbots contribute to the spread of false information.AI has rendered the relationship between humans and technology precarious. There is research to be done on the potential implications of AI for all the social sciences. We need to investigate how it is integrated into how we learn and how we live. I’d like to be involved in researching how we adapt to AI’s role as not only a tool but as an active and contributing participant in society.It’s a great tool for architecture – literally shaping the world around usNimrah TariqLondon-based graduate specialising in architectureIn my first years at university, we were discouraged from utilising AI for our architecture essays and models, only using it to proofread our work. However, in my final year, it was introduced a lot more into our process for rendering and enhancing design work.Our studio tutor gave us a mini-seminar on how to create AI prompts so that we could have detailed descriptions to put into architectural websites such asVisoid. This allowed us to put any models or drawings that we created into an AI prompt, asking it to create a concept design that suited our proposal. It gave my original ideas more complexity and a wide range of designs to play around with. While this was useful during the conceptual phase of our work, if the prompts were not accurate the AI would fail to deliver, so we learned how to be more strategic. I specifically used it after rendering my work as a final touch to create seamless final images.During my first and second year, AI didn’t have as much impact on the design process of my work; I mainly used existing buildings for design inspiration. However, AI introduced new forms of innovation, which accelerated the speed with which we can push the boundaries of our work. It also made the creative process more experimental, opening up a new way of designing and visualising.Now I have finished my degree, I’m intrigued to see how much more architecture can grow through using AI. Initially, I believed AI wasn’t the most creative way to design; now, I see it as a tool to improve our designs. It cannot replace human creativity, but it can enhance it.Architectural practices always ask job applicants for skills in software that uses AI, and you can already see how it is being incorporated in designs and projects. It has always been important to keep up to date with the latest technological advancements in architecture – and AI has reaffirmed this.The panel was compiled by Sumaiya Motara and Saranka Maheswaran, interns on the Guardian’s positive action schemeExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The panelUniversitiesJournalism educationArchitecturecommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s how it changes children’s livesPhineas HarperThe leftwing alternative to Scouts turns 100 this year. If Keir Starmer wants to empower Britain’s young people, it has much to teach himSat 16 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 07.13 EDTShareAt the age of six I made the most important decision of my life: I joinedWoodcraft Folk. It’s impossible to overstate the impact that growing up in the UK’s oldest co-educational youth movement made on me. My values, my skills, the deep friendships that have lasted into adulthood, the very fact that I am writing these words in this paper, every vote I have ever cast – all can be traced back to my time in Woodcraft Folk.The largest leftwing force in British youth work, the charity turns 100 this year. It has produced some striking alumni including former Labour party leaderJeremy Corbyn, pop starSophie Ellis-Bextor, poetMichael Rosen, and political editorRobert Peston. With the government announcingnew fundingto boost youth services outside schools, Woodcraft Folk’s centenary is the perfect moment to learn from its remarkable story and unique approach to youth empowerment.The challenges young people face in contemporary Britain take many forms. They are denied the ability toplay outsideas their grandparents did, or totake healthy risks. They are subject to suspicion from authority and derision in the media. They are fed the full addictive force of under-regulated new technologies almost from birth, then chastised for using them. There are no simple answers to these compounding challenges, but the mix of inclusive community, political education, fun outdoor activities and meaningful support that Woodcraft Folk offers young people could, perhaps, offer a blueprint.Founded in the aftermath of the first world war in south London by working-class young adults who wanted a more democratic and less militaristic alternative to Scouts and Guides, Woodcraft Folk grew quickly. Supported by co-operatives and trade unions, groups germinated across the country, combining after-school activities with large summer camps run on socialist principles. The hope was to model a more egalitarian society, giving young people the skills and knowledge to become active citizens.By the late 30s, Woodcraft Folk was a serious force. The Labour party hadrecognised itas “the appropriate organisation for the children of its members” and a mass display of the charity’s camping techniquestook place in Wembley stadium. Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists, was intimidated by its rise. According to former MP for Brighton Kemptown Lloyd Russell-Moyle, who also grew up in the organisation and is now its chief executive, Mosley’s Blackshirts marched to the gates of a 1938 Woodcraft Folk children’s camp in a show of intimidation.Fascist Mosley was right to see Woodcraft Folk as an adversary. A year later, it became the largest secular organisation to support the Kindertransport, helping Jewish children escape from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. Woodcraft Folk leader Henry Fair, christened “the second Schindler” by the press, wasput on the Gestapo death listfor his role in the evacuations.Over the decades the charity has remained at the forefront of ethical youth work. It has consistently campaigned against apartheid, austerity and war. It stood up for the rights of queer youth workers despite funderswithdrawing grants,marched againstthe invasion of Iraq andhas boycotted Israeli productssince 2010 in protest at the blockade of Gaza.For me, Woodcraft Folk was not just a political education, but a rich mix of hiking, making and adventures too. It’s where I first learned to light a fire in the rain, use a compass to navigate fog, to juggle and to edit film. The first time I boarded a plane was with Woodcraft Folk to be part of an international camp in Austria, pitching tents alongside children from all over the world. It was with Woodcraft Folk that I marched through London in my first big anti-war protest and, of course, had my first kiss.Many adults balk at the prospect of tackling sensitive subjects like war, sex and politics with children, but finding creative ways to navigate difficult issues is why the charity remains so important and relevant. In the internet era there is no healthy way to shield young people from complex topics, but neither should there be. Ignorance is a shoddy substitute for a culture of safe and open discursive learning, and children are far more capable of grappling with heavy truths than many adults give them credit for.Raised alongside difficult topics, the children of the charity aren’t just better prepared for the world, but more able to support and educate each other. For example, when as a kid I tried regurgitating a racist joke I’d heard at a school, it was my Woodcraft Folk peers, rather than adults, who immediately explained why the “joke” was stupid and offensive and made sure I never repeated my shameful mistake. At a Woodcraft Folk camp marking their centenary, volunteers put the charity’s theory of mixing politics with fun activities into practice. Night-time orienteering and ceilidhs ran alongside eviction resistance workshops and discussions around prison abolition. While the Scouts sing campfire songs likeCoca-Cola Came to TownandGing Gang Gooly, the Woodcraft Folk songbook includescivil rights anthems about Rosa Parksand Hiroshima.But if Woodcraft Folk has a clear vision of how society should empower the young, the current government has produced only topsy-turvy contradictory policies and proclamations. Last week the prime minister declared kids these days are “detached from the real world” and pledged £88m to liberate young people “stuck behind a screen”. But, at the same time Keir Starmer’s government is pumpingmore than twice as much moneyinto bringing more “AI learning into classrooms”.Why I love being leader of the cub scout pack | Hilary OsborneRead moreSixteen year olds are finally to get the vote (a right Woodcraft Folk has long campaigned for), yet simultaneously the censorious Online Safety Act has imposedsweeping restrictionson those same young people’s access to certain information,including political posts. A closer look at the newly announced youth funding reveals much of it is, in fact, earmarked for calcified initiatives like gym equipment and morepolice cadetsthat will fail to holistically broaden horizons.View image in fullscreenChildren and adults taking part in the opening ceremony during the Woodcraft Folk’s Camp 100 event in Northamptonshire.Photograph: Michael Preston for the Woodcraft FolkI was a shy and nerdy child, often bullied by local schoolchildren. There’s a parallel universe in which, retreating from my tormentors, I too could have become detached from the real world, the reclusive screen addict that Starmer fears. But Woodcraft Folk gave me space to flourish in my own way, supported by caring adults. I built profound friendships with peers, learned about big ideas and took on big challenges. My life and career have been immensely richer thanks to those experiences, as have the lives of thousands of others.If the government is serious about empowering young people, they should start by listening to and learning from the movement that’s already been doing it brilliantly for a century.Phineas Harper is a writer and curatorExplore more on these topicsChildrenOpinionScouts and scoutingLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Across two hours ofloose chaton New Heights, the show Kelce helms with his brother Jason – also a football player – Swift revealed she was obsessed with sourdough and lurked on baking blogs. The couple spent the summer with her family, caring for her 73-year-old father, Scott, after he had a quintuple heart bypass. She gave Kelce a lesson on Hamlet and taught him how to avoid internalising speculation about their two-year relationship. You could call them the tentpoles of the 35-year-old pop star’s brand: literary passions and professional self-awareness.One surprising revelation came near the end. Until the record-breaking149-date Eras tourthat Swift mounted from 2023-24, she said she had “never allowed myself to say: ‘You’ve arrived. You’ve made it.’” Being the only artist to win the Grammy for album of the year four times hadn’t done it; not the records broken, the acclaimed shifts from country to mainstream pop to indie. Nor her staggeringly successful campaign tore-record her first six albumsto devalue their master recordings, sold by her first record label to an industry nemesis, and then on to a private equity company. “But the Eras tour,” she said, “I was like, this is nothing like what I’ve experienced before. It was so much better than anything else.”Eras leapfrogged becoming the first billion-dollar tour to become the first $2bn tour. That would be plenty of cause for celebration and a good long rest. So would, as Swift announced in May,finally owning the rights to those first six albums, having successfully negotiated to buy the asset outright. (It ended her re-recording project: her 2006 debut is done and waiting, and she barely started 2017’s Reputation.) Her legacy isn’t just culturally assured, but materially secure. But Swift evidently isn’t ready to let that feeling of having “made it” go. She appeared on New Heights to announce her 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, arriving just 18 months after its predecessor and 10 months after Eras concluded: she is apparently congenitally incapable of rest, with a lot to process.View image in fullscreenSwift with Travis Kelce on his New Heights podcast to announce her next album.Photograph: Youtube/New HeightsThe public will – correctly – have long assumed that Swift has well and truly made it like no one ever has. But the record’s promised contents, intentions and release strategy are set to make Swift – and Kelce alongside her – hysterically famous at a new level, capitalising on and shifting industry norms in a way that may leave her detractors researching bunkers in which to hide from it all.Swift’s new album does not arrive until 3 October, but this week’s edition of the industry newsletter Record of the Day led with a tongue-in-cheek congratulations to “everyone at EMI andTaylor Swifton her latest No 1 album The Life of a Showgirl”. Supernova success is a foregone conclusion: last year’s introspective The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD) was the first album to pass a billion streams in its first week, reaching 1.76bn.Swift is beloved on an unfathomable scale. She is one of the last monocultural pop stars. You suspect she could have toured Eras for five years and still sold out every night. Her devout Swifties, casual pop fans and curious rubberneckers will likely propel Showgirl past TTPD’s record, such is the critical mass behind her, no matter what it sounds like. Her reign, says Annie Zaleski, the author of Taylor Swift: The Stories Behind the Songs, is unprecedented because “she’s so consistent and continuing to evolve”.But on the podcast, Swift sounded surprisingly aware of the limitations of TTPD – too wordy, too long, too downbeat – and keen to course-correct. That project, she said, had been about “catharsis”, “mess” and “rawness” following an apparently humiliating fling with the 1975’s Matty Healy. TTPD comprised 16 songs; and on release day, Swift dropped a previously unannounced 15-track sister album, The Anthology. For Showgirl, she said she craved “focus and discipline”: just 12 songs going behind the scenes of her Eras life, with “melodies that were so infectious you’re almost angry”. She made a surprising admission about her recent quality control: “Keeping the bar really high is something I’ve been wanting to do for a very long time.”Swift recorded Showgirl with the Swedish co-producers Max Martin and Shellback in Stockholm around Eras’ spring 2024 European run. The second of her three dates in the Swedish capital was the 89th date of the Eras tour: she named her fifth album, partly produced by the Swedes, 1989 after her birth year. Given the endless number games she plays, sowing numerology clues for fans setting up her future movements, you can assume the scheduling was no accident.View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift fans in Stockholm before an Eras tour show in May 2024.Photograph: Pontus Lundahl/TT/ReutersMartin and Shellback co-produced Red (2012), 1989 (2014) and Reputation (2017), homes to her biggest pure-pop smashes, among them Style, 22, and Blank Space. Her first subsequent album without them, 2019’s playful Lover, was regarded as ending that imperial period. Since then, Swift’s music has grown more muted and experimental, often in collaboration with the producers Jack Antonoff and the National’s Aaron Dessner, as if she were trying to carve out a sustainable future for a 30-something songwriter: 2020’s folksy Folklore and Evermore, the dusky pop of 2022’s Midnights, TTPD. They spawned no comparable radio hits; her biggest in recent years is Lover’s Cruel Summer, never officially released as a single but adopted as a fan favourite.Swift now seems to be framing those records as a phase – her art school years. The Showgirl era seems to be an attempt to recapture the kind of musical ubiquity where little kids yell your lyrics at birthday parties, as they did with 2014’s Shake It Off and now do with songs such as Chappell Roan’s Hot to Go! “My business is making music and taking care of my fans and I have ways of monitoring what they want from me and how best to entertain them, which is my job,” she told the Kelces. Eras was divided into segments reflecting each of her albums (except her 2006 debut): imagine it as a 149-night focus group.Swift’s monitoring also cannot have failed to note that her brand of hermetically sealed, grown-up pop has been ceding ground to Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli xcx, who have seized culture’s centre with less inhibited and far rowdier hits than the exacting Swift has ever made. Or perhaps ever could: one insurmountable difference is that Roan and xcx are unlikely to ever monitor fan desire or cater to it. And Martin, despite being second only to John Lennon and Paul McCartney for having the most US No 1 singles, has waned as a hitmaker. “I don’t think she can get ahead of those artists because she’s such a millennial pop star,” said a publicist for comparably superstar acts who asked to remain nameless. “She can’t create trends like those younger artists because they have a lot less to lose.”There is a sense that Swift is catching up: that she’s clocked criticisms, read the room. She released19 physical variants for TTPD, and was accused of exploiting fans and damaging the environment with excess vinyl production, a practice Billie Eilish has called “wasteful”. Showgirl appears to have a fairly industry-standard four. She is also competing with herself: if there is a tour, says the music business expert Eamonn Forde, it will have to take a significantly different form to Eras – residency-style, perhaps Vegas or in a bespoke venue, as recently done by Adele – to avoid unfavourable comparisons to the biggest tour of all time.Swift drew mass media coverage for her appearancesat Kelce’s gameswith the Kansas City Chiefs, prompting some aggrieved football fans to boo whenever she appeared on the jumbotron. In a trailer for her episode of New Heights, traditionally a sports show, Swift joked: “I think we all know that if there’s one thing that male sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens, it’s more of me.” Unluckily for them, the brand-building between Kelce and Swift looks set to make their association unavoidable.New Heights is part of their lore: after Kelce tried and failed to land a meeting with Swift after an Eras show, he told listeners he wanted to meet her. Intrigued, she took him up on it. The synchronicity began. It can be no mistake that Kelce’s cover of GQ magazine landed the same week as Swift’s podcast. Meanwhile, Swift rarely gives interviews: New Heights offers a mutually beneficial space where the couple wield full control, albeit with a soft touch: giving cute disclosures, such as his love of wild otters or her running to tell him about getting her masters back when he was gaming with the boys. The moment capitalised on the prevailing trend for A-listers to reserve their media engagements for fairly fannish video podcasts, making traditional journalists fear for their jobs as they dutifully write up any news lines.View image in fullscreenKelce and Swift after Kansas won the AFC Championship in January.Photograph: Ashley Landis/APPremiering Wednesday night in the US, the episode livestream crashed; within 24 hours it had 13m YouTube views, not including other podcast platform stats. The value to advertisers is huge, especially in anticipation of future Swift revelations. And Kelce, a comparatively old player at 35, is rumoured to be retiring after the coming season – his 13th year, Swift’s lucky number – so will be power-brokering his post-game career. Headmitted to GQhe had literally taken his eye off the ball, with underwhelming stats in his past two seasons, because he was chasing other opportunities. “It’s his Steven Bartlett, Diary of a CEO move,” said the publicist. “It’s future-proofing their lives. He can’t be a football player for ever; she can’t be a pop star for ever. It makes them a unit – look at how it worked for the Beckhams.”After a backlash around 2015-16 resulting from her beef with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, Swift managed to convincingly reboot her brand: a dedicated, literary songwriter who fights for artists’ rights. To onlookers outside the NFL, Kelce’s is ripe for shaping from two years of dating Swift. The couple are clearly conscious of this: Kelce told GQ he had “become way more strategic in understanding what I am portraying to people”, something you may imagine constitutes pillow talk in a business-minded household. “No man has ever said those words,” said the publicist.Eight things we learned from Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s marathon New Heights podcastRead moreKelce’s image is openhearted romantic. Notably, he is Swift’s first significant boyfriend to seem undaunted by her celebrity – her previous six-year relationship with the British actor Joe Alwyn took place almost entirely in private. A sweet aspect of the New Heights episode was two beefy jocks being so excited by and supportive of a girly pop star. Swift joked of his public entreaty to date her that “this is sort of what I’ve been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager”. The couple riffed on memes questioning Kelce’s intelligence – “it’s so hot when she says big words,” he said when Swift called Folklore “esoteric” – which is in itself very smart: positioning Kelce as lovable and non-threatening.Swift said she immediately warmed to him for not being “judgmental”, describing him as “a vibe booster in everyone’s life … like a human exclamation point”. The implication is that he could pep up your sentences if you let him into your heart. Kelce’s post-football business is being everyone’s boyfriend, not just Swift’s. His pesky family ties to Maga Trumpists won’t hurt him in the US; if Swift, who endorsed Kamala Harris in the last election, were to be questioned about this, “her argument can be that she’s the leftwing voice in these rooms”, the publicist said.Win-win. Although Swift seemed keen to establish some distance from the voluble TTPD era, a song from The Anthology about her and Kelce’s relationship seems to outline her present mindset. “I’m making a comeback to where I belong,” she sings on The Alchemy. “Ditch the clowns, get the crown / Baby, I’m the one to beat … These blokes warm the benches / We’ve been on a winning streak.”That streak is assured: next year marks the 20th anniversary of Swift’s self-titled debut, and she will inevitably release the re-recording to mark the occasion. Showgirl’s successor will be her 13th album, a significant moment in her lore. There are rumours of a behind-the-scenes Eras documentary to complement the record-breaking concert movie, extending the moment’s IP. Any new tour will once again recalibrate the live industry. Before Swift drops a note of music, or Kelce touches grass, they’re the coming season’s reigning champions."

She’s softly spoken, her voice retaining its geordie dialect and rising in pitch whenever she’s relaying an astonishing anecdote – which is often.Little Mix formed during the eighth series of The X Factor in 2011 and went on to sell 75m records, become the third-biggest girlband of all time (behind the Spice Girls and the Supremes, ahead of Destiny’s Child) and the first to spend more than 100 weeks inside the UK top 10. In 2021, they were the first girlband to win the Brit award for best British group. When Noel Gallagher claimed that they were “not in the same league as Oasis”, who had won in 1996, Thirlwall retorted that it was “a shame, really. Because we are definitely the most successful girl group in the country, but he’s not even the most successful performer in his family.”View image in fullscreenBodysuit byNensi Dojaka. Sleeves byT LabelThis wit and swagger has been expertly parlayed into a solo career that promises to make Thirlwall Britain’s next homegrown superstar. She tells me that some of her earliest artistic influences were the drag queens of Benidorm and – in the best possible way – it shows. Her solo music and visuals are delightfully melodramatic, embracing a more-is-more approach that implies if the kitchen sink is missing, it’s only because she decided to throw in a bathtub instead.Four singles in, she’s flying. Her debut, Angel of My Dreams (a maximalist treatise on the agonies and ecstasies of pop fame that packs more genres than the average person’s Spotify Wrapped into three minutes and 17 seconds), was nominated for an Ivor Novello award. When she performed it at the Brit awards – dropping through a double-height trapdoor and embarking on a dizzying succession of costume changes and dance breaks before taking flight in a pair of giant angel wings – this publication described her ashaving stolen the show.“I think you should be ambitious as a pop star,” she says today. “You shouldn’t give yourself a ceiling.” In an era of reduced budgets and tightened belts, was it easy to convince her record company to let her stage an episodic performance told in five acts? “They understand that if they want me to be the next big pop girlie, then they have to put their hand in their pocket.” She adopts a mock scandalised tone: “I’m not a low‑budget artist! Give me what I need!” Their investment was rewarded when Thirlwall won best pop act.It’s easy for someone white and privileged like Matty Healy to opt out of politics. Good for you, hun!View image in fullscreenFull look byMiu MiuAnother headline-generating performance followed, this time at Glastonbury festival, where Thirlwall led the Woodsies stage in a chant of “Fuck you” to, among other things, Reform, welfare cuts, silencing protest and selling arms. Was she surprised at the heated online reaction? “I was ready for a backlash from the right kind of people,” she says. “I saw a lot of people saying ‘Your Glastonbury set was really good until you got political’ or ‘I used to be a fan of yours until you got political’. But, hun, you were never a fan, because I’ve always piped up.”Memorably, back in 2015, Thirlwall hijacked the official Little Mix Twitter account to tweet that she was “truly saddened and ashamed” by parliament voting to bomb Isil targets in Syria. “I got in a bit of trouble for that,” she concedes cheerfully. “But I felt very passionate about it. I’m no expert in politics but I’ve always taken an interest. Around 9/11 I saw first‑hand the Islamophobia that my grandad experienced, and as someone of Arab heritage I’ve seen people turning a blind eye to the Middle Eastern tragedy. What’s quite funny is that we didn’t have individual Twitter accounts, and we each had to sign off tweets from the Little Mix account with our name. So I did my tweet about Syria and ended it with ‘xxJadexx’”.A stalwart defender of LGBTQ+ rights and a vocal advocate for a free Palestine, she is disparaging of artists who opt out of politics. “I don’t think you can be a pop artist and cover your eyes. I saw Matty Healy say that hedoesn’t want to be political, which I found disappointing. It’s very easy for someone who’s white and straight and very privileged to say that. Good for you, hun!”Before Thirlwall began making weapons-grade bangers, she was a student of pop music. Born in South Shields, she was obsessed with Madonna, Kylie and Janet Jackson, papering her wardrobe doors with moodboards of their most iconic looks. Her mum, Norma, a primary school business manager of Yemeni and Egyptian descent, had the look of Jade’s ultimate idol Diana Ross – and for a time young Jade believed her mum to be living a double life. Norma encouraged the fantasy, claiming that she was going to play concerts when, in fact, she was off down the bingo hall.View image in fullscreenWith her mum at the 2016 Brit awards.Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImageThirlwall was always close to her mum; Norma’s at the studio with us today, and there’s a song on the forthcoming album about her mum’s ill health, which includes lupus (“She was really poorly in hospital and I thought: how can I write a really sad song that we’re all going to want to shake our tits to?”). Still, as a teenager Thirlwall felt frustrated that they rarely had deep conversations, and race wasn’t discussed. “I think my mam had suppressed that part of herself because she didn’t want to confront the trauma of her experiences of racism,” she says.During the Black Lives Matter protests, they began sharing stories and “everything clicked into place for me and I had a new understanding and empathy for what she’d been through. Where we’re from there were so many microaggressions, people calling us the P-word, that we were used to it. And in that moment we had to be like, actually it’s not OK for people to call us those things. My mam had to confront people she’d known most of her life. The right people apologise and better themselves, and you get rid of the wrong people. It was a big change for us.”Despite her dreams of stardom, as a child Thirlwall was shy and tomboyish. She was a victim of racist bullying at her overwhelmingly white secondary school. Coupled with the death of her beloved maternal grandfather when she was 13, this provided the catalyst, she says, for a years-long fight with anorexia. When she successfully auditioned for The X Factor aged 18 in 2011, it was just a few months after having been discharged from hospital, with doctors allowing her to compete on the proviso that she maintained a healthy weight. Wasn’t throwing herself at the mercy of Simon Cowell’s notoriously brutal juggernaut a risky strategy for someone so vulnerable?“In retrospect, if the show had done a proper mental health assessment, then they wouldn’t have let me on,” she says. Was there not a psych test? “It was very surface. Judging by some of the people in that X Factor house, it wasn’t done properly. Bless them, through no fault of their own, some of those people were mentally unwell. All of the female contestants slept in the same bedroom, and one of them would get up, put all her wigs out and start doing a Britney Spears performance at three in the morning. Or you’d be woken up by the sound of her using her vibrator in the middle of the night. We’d have a meeting with lawyers and someone who was obviously not in the best headspace would be picking their feet and eating it in front of everyone. It was like, ‘Is this the music industry?’”Jesy leaving the group was incredibly painful. I wish it’d been handled differentlyView image in fullscreenJade, Jesy, Perrie and Leigh-Anne The X Factor Live, 2011.Photograph: Ken McKay/Talkback Thames/Rex/ShutterstockView image in fullscreenJADE performing at Glastonbury this year.Photograph: Jim Dyson/RedfernsIt wasn’t only the contestants enacting surreal stunts. “At one point I got led to a room in the house to get my foof waxed, which I’d never had before.” Hang on, I interrupt, why would a teenager need a bikini wax to appear on The X Factor? “I don’t know! I just remember lying with my legs akimbo, looking up at the window, thinking, ‘I hope there’s not a pap there.’”For a show powered by tragic backstories, I’m surprised that Thirlwall’s anorexia wasn’t made part of her onscreen “journey”. “I made sure it wasn’t,” she says. “They’d always try to fish for a sob story, but I didn’t want that to be my identity. I was starting afresh. I thought, OK, this is a huge opportunity for me, it’s a chance to change my life.” She wanted a future bigger than her eating disorder? “Exactly. I wanted to do music more than anything, and if the only way to achieve that was to be healthy, that’s what I had to do. It was the ultimate motivation.”These days, Thirlwall says that most of the negative comments she receives online are about her putting on weight. That must be incredibly difficult for a recovering anorexic? “I have a daily battle with myself not to go on Ozempic,” she says. “I don’t judge people that do, but because I have a history of eating disorders, I don’t know where taking something like that would end for me.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenShirt and shorts byKasia Kucharska. Boots byAeydeShe believes that the trolling is a depressing byproduct of reaching a broader audience. “Little Mix fans were all about empowerment and celebrating your body however you look. Now I’m in my 30s and the healthiest I’ve ever been, but every time I post a picture, there are comments saying, ‘She must be pregnant.’ The sad thing is that it’s usually women. But people are used to seeing me in a group environment five or 10 years ago when I was stick-thin because I was in my early 20s with an eating disorder.”Did she relapse while she was in the band? “I didn’t think it at the time, but when I look back at photos of periods when I was quite unhappy, I think, wow, girlie, you were very, very thin. The pattern was there. Historically, if I’ve ever felt that something is out of my control, then restricting food has been a means of controlling my life in a very toxic way.”Can she recall a time when she felt particularly out of control? “In summer 2017 I was living in a flat in east London and having really bad night terrors. I’d have such disturbing nightmares – things that are too horrific to say, dreams where I’d be harming myself – that I’d force myself to stay awake by drinking coffee and playing loud music. I’d be going to perform at outdoor concerts having not slept for days.”Eventually her mum drove down from South Shields and took her home to the family doctor, who prescribed antidepressants. “I felt so sad, and so horrendously guilty for feeling sad. I had the fear that something awful would happen with my mam’s lupus and I wouldn’t be there. I missed family funerals and things like that, and wondered if it was all worth it.”She executes a hard blink, as if resetting her thoughts, or perhaps banishing a troubling one. “That’s when my mam decided that her and her best mate would come on the road with us – it was so cute. The pair of them like Ab Fab, driving me to each venue, making sure I was fed and watered.” Did she ever consider taking a break from the group? “If you stop working in this business, then everybody wants to know why, and I couldn’t be arsed for everything that came with that. So I kept it moving.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But being in a precision-engineered pop group for 10 years is not for the delicate. The band’s launch coincided with the advent of Twitter and online fandoms, meaning that the girls found themselves acting as guinea pigs in a strange new land that was yet to be mapped. At the same time, the paparazzi were still a hostile force, not yet rendered obsolete by Instagram. “We were 18 or 19 and the paps would be trying to get pictures up our skirts when we were getting into cars,” she says. “Once we were in the car, they’d try and get in with us to carry on taking pictures, which would be invasive for anyone, but especially young girls.”Did she ever feel scared? “Oh yeah, I was always scared,” she says with a casual air that suggests she long ago resigned herself to daily terror being the natural order of things.Over time, Thirlwall and fellow member Leigh-Anne Pinnock “understood that as women of colour we had to work a bit harder to be noticed”. At signings, young fans would skip past Pinnock, the darkest-skinned member of the group. “Then there was a track on our third album where the label suggested that me and Leigh-Anne not be on a song – at all. No backing vocals, nothing. Obviously when you’re a young woman and you’re told that, you’re going to feel like utter shit. We’re working just as hard, we know we can sing – what do you mean you don’t want us on the track?”Their bandmates Perrie Edwards and Jesy Nelson refused to appear without them. “By halfway through our career, everyone knew not to try and separate us because we were so headstrong about always being equal. I do believe that’s the main reason we lasted so long.”The band released five platinum albums in six years, a relentless pace when accompanied by the requisite tours and promotional duties. Then, in 2020, the machine ground to a halt when the UK went into lockdown. “When Covid happened it shifted everyone’s perspective on what they wanted. We already knew that our next tour would be the last for a while, but Covid was a bit of a catalyst – it was the beginning of the end in terms of the obvious dynamic shift.”She’s referring to the departure of Nelson, who left the band in December 2020, saying, “I find the constant pressure of being in a girl group and living up to expectations very hard.” Nelson had been relentlessly trolled for her appearance since the advent of the group, and was hospitalised after taking an overdose in 2013. In 2019 she made a documentary called Odd One Out about these struggles. In the film, Thirlwall is shown saying, “We just had to watch this amazing, funny person become like a broken doll. It was horrible.” She later revealed that she had created a burner account on MailOnline to fire back at Nelson’s trolls.In October 2020 restrictions were eased enough to allow Little Mix to film their Sweet Melody music video. By Nelson’s account, the shoot triggered a panic attack and she ended up back in hospital. “Then the girls spoke to Mum and said, ‘We think Jesy should come out of this now. She has to look after herself,’”Nelson told the Guardian in 2021. Does that fit Thirlwall’s own recollection? “Some of it, yeah. Partly.”View image in fullscreenCoat byDries Van Noten. Tights byFalkeIt’s obviously not a topic that she wants to dwell on, but I’m keen to understand what happened. Thirlwall has said elsewhere that the contact was “abruptly cut off”. Why so, if it was a mutual decision, with Nelson wanting to leave and the rest of the group supporting her decision? “I can’t answer that question because we weren’t the ones that did it.” Were there any attempts made to get in touch with Nelson after she’d left? “Yeah, there were, and then … yeah.”For the first time our conversation stalls. Was it painful to realise that their friendship couldn’t survive Nelson leaving the group? “It was incredibly painful. For all of us that was the worst part, and it’s taken a lot of understanding and therapy and all those things to work out how that can happen when you’ve devoted so much time and love to someone. My biggest wish for that whole period is that it was handled differently. I just would’ve loved us to all sit and chat about it.“We absolutely adored Jesy like family – it wasn’t just work,” she continues. “We all wanted to protect her, because we understood that trauma there and what she’d been through. I think we handled it as best as we could. All of a sudden we were a member short in the middle of album promo, with everyone asking what was going on. Obviously we don’t speak any more, and things happened that I don’t think should have, but I still do feel an element of protection towards Jesy. Nobody fully understands how complex the whole thing was – it wasn’t just a case of someone wanting to leave. Numerous things built up in the last year and in the back of my mind I knew it was going to happen. I’d just like for it to have happened in a … better way.”One positive to come from Nelson’s departure was the remaining members’ determination to resolve any lingering conflicts. The band had been in group therapy at the start of their career, and re-entered as a trio. “We’d seen what happened when we didn’t air things out and so there were apologies between the three of us. We all knew that we really wanted to end things on a high, still adoring each other, so we’d do whatever we had to do to achieve that.”Thirlwall says that the group’s final – for now – tour was the most fun she’d ever had. “Anything we’d wanted to say had been said by that point and we loved each other more for it, and had more of an understanding of each other. At the end of the tour we were like, ‘Do we really want this to be the last one?’ It’s definitely not a closed door. Even now if one of us is having a bad day as a solo artist, we’re like, ‘Hello, knock, knock, is it time?!’ Not yet, but it will happen.”For now, Thirlwall is laser-focused on her solo career. While Little Mix worked to a rough template – empowering songs about loving your mates and forgetting useless boyfriends – she has enjoyed exploring more nuanced themes on her album. Singles Angel of My Dreams and It Girl are inspired by her experiences in the music industry. (The former includes the lyric “Selling my soul to a psycho”, seemingly a reference to Cowell’s record label, Syco, which Little Mix were signed to until 2018. It Girl includes the lyrics “I’m not your baby doll … This bitch can’t be controlled”.) “I wanted to be tongue-in-cheek and admit that I love the game and I hate it at the same time,” she says. “It was a way to give an honest account of my experiences without being ‘woe is me’.”View image in fullscreenWith her boyfriend, Jordan Stephens of Rizzle Kicks, in March.Photograph: Matt Keeble/Getty ImagesSeveral of the tracks are about her relationship with Rizzle Kicks singer Jordan Stephens. “When you’re a successful woman it’s really hard to find someone who isn’t intimidated by you or jealous of that,” she says. “When I met Jordan I wasn’t looking for anyone. Me and my best friend, Holly, were in lockdown together, and we promised ourselves a humongous dick hunt when it was over.” After being introduced to Stephens by a mutual friend, and bored of doing Zoom interviews, Thirlwall suggested they liven things up by dressing in business suits and asking each other job interview questions for their first online date. (“One of mine was, ‘Do you clap when the plane lands?’ because that’s a big ick for me.”) After their first in-person meetup, in Greenwich park, “I came home to Holly and was like, I’m so sorry, the dick hunt is over. She was fuming.”Stephens recently published a memoir detailing his experiences of ADHD, and Thirlwall says dating someone with the disorder has been a learning curve. “When I met him I was like, why is he so messy and why is he never on time?” she says. “We had a few clashes, but it was up to me to do my research and understand his brain. Once I did that it was a turning point in our relationship because he felt loved and supported. I follow a lot of TikTok accounts for people with ADHD partners and they really have been helpful because I have a lot more patience and understanding.”Now the trio live together in Thirlwall’s six-bedroom house in south-east London. What’s a typical evening for the pop star, her boyfriend and her best friend since secondary school? “Whoever gets in first makes dinner. I’m not a big TV watcher, but them two love Love Island. Me and Holly are like grandmas, so we’ll sit and do a jigsaw – anything to stop me going on my phone. At the moment I’m making a Lego castle. Then there’s always a point in the evening where Jordan knows to take himself to bed because we’re going to watch Lady Gaga music videos.”Jesy Nelson on leaving Little Mix: ‘I felt everybody hated me’Read moreThe Jade Thirlwall of today is galaxies away from the anxious teenager who auditioned for The X Factor – she’s firmly in control of her own story, with a record deal stipulating that she has final say on all creative decisions. Still, she’s conscious never to lose touch with the inner fangirl who dreamed of emulating her idols. “A lot of making this record has been about pleasing my younger self and tapping into that love of pop that I’ve always had,” she says. “When I’m nervous before going on stage, I picture her in the front row, reminding me not to forget that part of myself.” Young Jade was there at the Brits, on Later … With Jools Holland and at Glastonbury. “I close my eyes and imagine her telling me, ‘You’re going to kill it!’”And then? “And then I do.”JADE’s debut solo album, That’s Showbiz Baby!, is released on 12 September.Explore more on these topicsLittle MixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a feat of sustained poetic imagination, the playwright describes pregnancy – and pregnancy loss – in terms of space travel. And it is not just a passing analogy but a complete vision, from lift-off to orbit to “Houston, we have a problem”.Remarkably the metaphor does not wear thin. Rather, it powers a beautiful and touching exploration of an intrepid journey undertaken and never completed.Writing from experience, Wilson breaks from the traditional pregnancy narrative early on: not only do they want to have this baby but their mother is delighted for them, too. Performing in spangly astronaut costume, with a helmet that lights up from the inside thanks to Adi Currie’s inventive lighting design, Wilson is an enthusiastic space traveller, ready for a voyage towards the stars.Their boyfriend, known as Nasa, is not so intrepid. Surely Wilson is too young, too irresponsible, too unhealthily addicted to cheese crackers to go on such a mission, he says. His departure will make this a solo trip.F-Bomb Theatre’s production, co-directed by Cora Bissett and Niloo-Far Khan and part of the Made in Scotland showcase, is more weightless than earthbound. Although this is a study of grief and of the difficulty of explaining the loss of an unborn child – especially to those astronauts who have completed a successful mission – the metaphor keeps Wilson from sounding maudlin or introspective.Thanks for Being Here review – Ontroerend Goed’s joyful show puts the audience in the spotlightRead moreFrom the start, they connect more withAstronaut Barbie, a true pioneer when released in 1965, than with Barbie’s pregnant friend Midge or her conventional husband Allan. Wilson’s desire to be a parent is not about settling down but embarking on an adventure. That it is an adventure they do not complete leaves them in an emotional vacuum, sad but for the recruitment of a replacement ground crew.At theGilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalPregnancyFestivalsParents and parentingSpacereviewsShareReuse this content"

And this week, she took to Instagram to protest about a new trend in cinema and TV: on-set photos.Screenshotting leaked images of actor Jack Lowden dressed as Mr Darcy in Dolly Alderton’s adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, she wrote: “Can we please STOP showing movies and TV shows being made?! I’m closing my eyes. I don’t want to see Mr Darcy getting dressed!” Addressing the fan who originally posted the images, she added: “All the magic is going away! C’mon!”Unfortunately for Meyers, the removal of movie magic isn’t limited to Mr Darcy. Productions that have recently had on-set images shared online include The Devil Wears Prada 2, And Just Like That and American Love Story, the Ryan Murphy miniseries about Carolyn Bessette and John F Kennedy Jr.View image in fullscreenAnne Hathaway on the set of The Devil Wears Prada 2Photograph: Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC ImagesIf Sarah Jessica Parker’s JW Anderson pigeon bag spotted on the set of And Just Like That wasa “moment”, Margot Robbie on rollerblades filming Barbie in 2023 perhaps cemented the phenomenon. These images spawned online chatter, news stories and memes long before the film hit the cinemas.This year, the outfits worn on set by Sarah Pidgeon as Bessette Kennedy, weredescribed as “fashion murder”on Instagram, and fashion is the common factor that links these productions – unlike, say, a thriller or a sci-fi film, what characters wear is central to the appeal. This month, images of The Devil Wears Prada 2 characters at a make-believe Met Gala have been pored over on social media.Henrik Lischke, senior fashion features editor at Grazia, says on-set images are popular with their readers. “Across social and online, the appetite for it is huge. They lend themselves to a variety of content. It’s about the outfits we’ve seen and loved, or these days the internet turns everything into memes.”For The Devil Wears Prada 2, the ubiquity of the on-set photo itself was fodder formemes– with people screenshotting stars like Selena Gomez to Olivia Rodrigo with the caption “spotted filming scenes for The Devil Wears Prada 2 in New York”.Amy Odell, fashion commentator and author ofa new biography of Gwyneth Paltrow, thinks the frenzy is down to a hunger for female-friendly fashion content in film and TV, which is not satisfied. “There is a dearth of this type of movie or TV show, and people want fashion-oriented things like And Just Like That. A lot of people are hate-watching that, and it’s not a very good show, but I’m going to be a little sad when it’s over … We haven’t had a fashiony show that’s about women’s relationships with one another [for a long time].”View image in fullscreenSarah Jessica Parker in And Just Like That…Photograph: James Devaney/GC ImagesOdell says that while researching her book, people talked to her about “how, when [Paltrow] was filming Shakespeare in Love, efforts were made to remove cameras from the set because they didn’t want photos of her in costume to leak. I’m sure it was much easier to control then.”These days “you’re going to see on TikTok, you’re going to see it on Instagram,” says Lischke. “Last September in New York, I was in the West Village and bumped into the And Just Like That set. It wasn’t just paparazzi. It was a huge crowd. I ended up filming it and sending it to my family.”If this is a trend that suits the digital age, it’s not new, says Helen Warner, associate professor in media and digital cultures at the University of East Anglia: “There’s always been an appetite for this kind of material, from the beginnings of Hollywood and the popularity of the ‘film fan’ magazine.”She says it is part of the way the industry has developed. “[Hollywood has] long since cultivated this kind of ‘parasocial’ relationship with film stars. This feeling of ‘knowing them’ has intensified thanks to the increasing accessibility of these kinds of images”.Neither Warner nor Odell believe on-set photos will mean fatigue by the time the final product reaches our screens. This bears out with the Barbie example – the filmtopped $1bn in box office sales.Lischke, like Meyers, would like to keep the surprise for when he finally sits in the cinema seat. “[The Devil Wears Prada 2 team] will have to get more creative with the scenes that they don’t film out in the open so certain elements of surprises remain,” he says. He names Gia Coppola’s film The Last Showgirl as a good example of when this works, due to a plotline that wasn’t in the trailer. “You were surprised by something entirely new,” he says. “I hope that The Devil Wears Prada 2 is like that – that there are plot twists and outfits we haven’t seen.”Explore more on these topicsFilmTelevision industryTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My horror marathon in search of stage frightsThis year’s Edinburgh festival is full of creepy shows, from a jaw-clenching haunting to sci-fi terror. Our writer braves the darkness in Auld Reekie’s fringe venues for a day of fearKate WyverSat 16 Aug 2025 08.11 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 08.35 EDTShareIam a wimp. When my friends used to gather to screech over horror movies after school, I would sit watching Countdown with one of their mums until it was over. I had to watchThe Blair Witch Projectwith all the lights on and I never got through the opening scene ofThe Ring. But when it comes to horror on stage, I’ve rarely been fazed. Bar the odd jump scare, how scary can theatre really be? I set out to find out by watching a full day of horror shows at the Edinburgh fringe.I start off gently withElysium, a winding eat-the-rich tale told through lilting song. The gated community of Elysium Court is designed to keep the riff-raff out, but the inhabitants should be more worried about what they’re locking in. With the air of two friends casually making music in their garage, Milly Blue and Jessie Maryon Davies of Ghouls Aloud unpack the concept that exclusivity equals safety, watching from a distance as the containment crushes everyone in Elysium Court into the same make and model – or destroys them if they attempt to stand out.Blue’s storytelling is sweet and unsettling, though occasionally veers off into tangents that don’t serve the story. Davies laces tension through with moody piano, with Blue looping her voice in climbing harmonies above, as strange events begin to haunt Elysium’s newest resident. Digging into the soil beneath the standard-issue astroturf that clamps down every garden in the Court, old monsters start to emerge. The darkness creeps in slowly and the script wants tightening, with some songs pausing the action rather than driving it on, but I decide I like my horror being sung to me. Maybe this was the problem all along.View image in fullscreenOld monsters emerge … Elysium.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianFrom the candy-pink satire of Elysium, the pitch-blackScatter: A Horror Playcouldn’t be a sharper shift. The room is so dark it’s a struggle to even find your seat. This low lighting continues as Patrick McPherson’s jaw-clenching show of hereditary haunting reserves any bright light for blinding flashes. Liberally smattered with jump scares, the show sometimes leans so heavily on Will Hayman’s intense shadows and sharp, saturated filters that the design comes to feel like the main event rather than an anchor to sink us deeper into the story.McPherson plays Tom, a young man reluctantly recounting the trip he and his brother took to scatter their father’s ashes in rural Wales. In the predictably traumatising process, they discover that their dad’s end-of-life aggression, previously brushed off as delirium, was something far more sinister, his acts of violence actually a deeply troubled form of protection. Jonny Harvey’s direction makes repeated use of the classic torch sweeping around a blackened room and heavy, breathless silences followed by piercing, sinew-shaking screams. These old tricks are effective. I sink into my seat every time the torch winds up.A traditional folk horror, Scatter takes itself seriously. You can’t help wondering if the balance of tension would intensify if some lightness was buried anywhere in the text; McPherson’s performance, though convincing, starts off dour and stays similarly severe throughout. The ending is rushed, but Scatter sets out to scare, and it succeeds. As we pick our way out of the theatre, my heart takes a moment to return to its regular pace.Later that afternoon, in another about-turn, Jed Mathre does a stellar job of making a whole room want to punch him in the face. Melanie Godsey’s existential comedy,SponsoredBythe Void, offers a queer awakening through the form of a supernatural visitor. Mathre plays the emotionally illiterate boyfriend to Leah (Kelly Karcher) who is so overburdened by his uselessness that she’s close to bursting. When The Void (Jennifer Ewing) waltzes in, Leah is immediately felled by her hot dom energy and her demand that Leah does exactly what she wants. “Do you eat?” Leah asks her, quivering. “I devour,” The Void replies.Created by Seattle-based company The Co-Conspirators, this goofy, sultry sci-fi horror revels in Leah’s uncompromising newfound confidence, with Kennedy looking on in horror and Leah’s friend Val (Be Russell, funny to her bones) watching with delight as she rejects everything she has previously accepted without resistance. Subservience to men is the real horror here. Eschewing subtleness, the play asks direct questions of how a woman can get trapped into a role she never asked for, and how she can – with support of a sexy, suited-up otherworldly entity – break her way out of it.View image in fullscreenLooping inevitability … David Alnwick’s The Dare Witch Project.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the Guardian“I just want you to know what you’re getting into,” David Alnwick says as he pops his head around the door, checking we’re not actually here for the musical cabaret going on upstairs, before leaping to the side of the stage to fiddle with the video setup. Where a handful of these horror shows use film to enhance the spookiness, Alnwick’sThe Dare Witch Projectis the only one to rely on it. Soldiering through technical issues, our eager host talks us through the footage he supposedly found in an old VHS he got off eBay. The man in the recordings looks surprisingly like him, with his clothes and his voice, and a determination to complete a challenge inspired by the infamous found-footage movie The Blair Witch Project.While most of the tension from this Free Fringe show comes from the screen, as Alnwick presents these clips of the mysterious doppelganger recording himself in the woods, there is a singular, inspired physical magic trick used to beautifully creepy effect. The looping inevitability built into the show mounts tension as we wait, nervously, for what we know is coming, but it takes too long to get there to truly shake any nerves. I find myself wanting to be more scared than I am. Perhaps I’m becoming a horror convert after all.‘Casually jaw-dropping’: at an Edinburgh fringe of tricks and treats, Ben Hart has the magic touchRead moreThe last show of the evening is the least terrifying. Maria Teresa Creasey’s toothless attempt at a vampiric comedy-horror,Degenerate, begins ominously, as the writer-performer lies face-down, bound and gagged, waiting for one of us to untie her. But that’s the end of the innovation. Pitched as experimental, Creasey’s babbling speech acts like a fly being swatted, scattily returning to a smattering of ideas but never settling long enough to offer a performance worth our time.Hazily buzzing around the notion of women being deemed irrelevant as they age, Creasey’s character eventually flits towards the eternal youth of the vampire and lip-syncs to clips of scary movies. She wants to last for ever. I’m glad this performance does not.Elysium is atGilded Balloon at Appleton Toweruntil 24 August; Scatter: A Horror Play is atUnderbelly, Cowgate, until 24 August; Sponsored By the Void is atGreenside @ Riddles Courtuntil 16 August; David Alnwick: The Dare Witch Project is atPBH’s Free Fringe @ Voodoo Roomsuntil 24 August;Degenerateis atPleasance Courtyarduntil 23 AugustExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was teaching English as a foreign language in South Korea, and I showed a video of a BBC Glastonbury roundup on the projector as part of the lesson. I remember glimpsing an incredibly cute blond guy on stage, and being transfixed. I knew immediately that he was gay because the way he moved was unashamedly fluid and graceful. He was doing a pirouette.The clip was so short there wasn’t even a mention of the name of the band, so I had to do some detective work. I Googled something ridiculous like “bleached hair gay man Glastonbury 2015” and trawled through hundreds of search results until I found him.I was 24 and out as bisexual, but I had never done more than kiss a man. I grew up on the west coast of Ireland, and while my area was relatively liberal, we still used the F-slur regularly and referred to anything remotely crap or weak as “gay”. At school, I liked girls enough to distract myself from the fact that I also liked boys – but by the time I was in my final year of university, I wasn’t able to ignore my feelings for men any more. I told friends and family I was bisexual, but I did it in an almost aggressive way. My attitude was: “I’m bisexual and if you have a problem with that, I don’t want to hear about it.” Looking back, I think I was being defensive: I didn’t want to discuss my sexuality because I wasn’t entirely comfortable with it yet.Olly refers to his love interest as ‘boy’, and I remember listening out for that word and feeling electrified by itIt made me feel vulnerable to accept that I was interested in men because it messed with my sense of masculinity. I am still often perceived by strangers as straight. When I did develop a crush on a boy, growing up, it would be a macho lad who liked football and girls. Discovering Olly Alexander was seismic for me because it was the first time I fancied a man who was openly gay in his presentation. In the weeks after I found Olly online, I listened to Years & Years’ debut album, Communion, on repeat. In a few songs, Olly refers to his love interest as “boy”, and I remember listening out for that word and feeling electrified by it.I was taking taekwondo lessons in my spare time, and I suggested to my instructor that we put Communion on in the background while we trained. Because it’s a form of combat, taekwondo is a hypermasculine sport, but it is also elegant and feminine in the sense that it is like a dance. Listening to that music while doing those moves made me feel as if I was pulling together the two parts of my own nature, and finding some balance between the masculine and the feminine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

My instructor loved the record too, although he was a very traditional South Korean man, and from small comments he had made I could tell he was casually homophobic. He had no idea that he was enjoying an album about gay men in the club.The music unlocked something in me. I began to pursue boys and go to gay clubs.My first sexual experiences with men happened at precisely the same time as I was discovering Communion. When I listen to Shine now – which is about the magnetic feeling between two men – I still get this feeling in my stomach. It’s difficult for me to disentangle the feeling of desire from the excitement I feel when I hear the opening bars. I started dating my first boyfriend around the time Years & Years’ second album, Palo Santo, came out, so Olly Alexander’s music doesn’t just sound like lust to me. It also sounds like love.AnonymousDid a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

But now that Gary Lineker has hung up his boots and bid farewell toMatch of the Dayafter 26 years, Mark Chapman can finally have his moment.While more casual fans won’t be aware of what the veteran broadcaster – affectionately known as “Chappers” – will bring as the new focal point, to the diehards he’s long been a known quantity.Widely respected for his relaxed manner and astute questioning, Chapman, 51, has hosted Match of the Day 2 on Sunday nights since 2013 (while occasionally covering for Lineker) and also presents a number of sports programmes acrossBBCRadio 5 Live.But before establishing himself as one of the top broadcasters in the country, he began his career as a continuity announcer on BBC television in 1996. He then became the cricket correspondent for BBC North East radio, before joining BBC Radio 1 as a Newsbeat sports reader on the Sara Cox and Scott Mills shows – where he developed the nickname “Chappers”. He later joined BBC Radio 5 Live to host 5 Live Sport on Mondays.Alongside his run on Match of the Day 2, he was also BBC Sport’s chief rugby league presenter, fronting its coverage of the Rugby League World Cup and RFL Challenge Cup matches.Chapman is one ofMatch of the Day’s three new hosts, alongside Kelly Cates and Gabby Logan. While Cates will present a UEFA Super Cup highlights show on Wednesday and Logan will present the newly rebranded Match of the Day on Sunday, the three will rotate across the shows throughout the season.View image in fullscreen‘It helps that we’re all really different from Gary,’ says Kelly Cates, left, who joins Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan in Match of the Day’s lineup of hosts.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAHe’s always been passionate about the game, declaring early in his career that he spent his time off “playing football and watching football”. Whenasked to describe himself in three words, he opted for “stroppy, moody and temperamental”.Appearing on the Scott Mills Breakfast show on Friday alongside the other two hosts, Chapman joked with Mills about their time working together. “He never took off his coat,” Mills reminisced, “he was there for a good time, not a long time.”Mills also highlighted one of his BBC diary entries from the early noughties, when the pair went to Magaluf with Jo Whiley. “We went to dinner with DJ Sammy in Palma except for Chappers, who decided to shun a swanky celebrity dinner in order to do research on the Magaluf bar scene. Apparently, when you walk down the street, there are people who physically drag you into bars and force you to drink two pints for two euros with a free shot. Poor Chappers never stood a chance,” the entry read.Others have also said it is Chapman’s warmth, humour and experience that make him a joy to work with. “He’s somebody that knows the game very well, is deeply passionate about it and is very good at providing a space where all the different pundits and people involved feel comfortable,” said Nedum Onuoha, who worked with Chapman onPlanet Premier League.“He tries to get the best out of you. He is very good at being able to create a show that’s enjoyable, and I think that goes a long way in punditry.”Onuoha said Chapman was “really funny and dry with certain things”. He said the presenter always remembered “that it is a game” and wanted people to have fun.“He knows that laughing brings people together, as opposed to arguing about things that honestly don’t really matter. His personality is a great one, he’s fun to be around and that can really make a difference, especially for new people entering the industry.”Chapman lived with his wife, Sara, in Hale, Greater Manchester until her death from cancer in 2020. The couple had three children together.One of the things that will undoubtedly be welcomed by BBC bosses is Chapman’s approach to social media. He hasn’t posted on X since January 2021, which sets him apart from his predecessor, who quit the BBC after an antisemitism row and never shied away from expressing his views on topics from the war in the Middle East to the UK government’s immigration policy.Asked about the principal duties of a pundit in aninterview with the Guardian in 2018, Chapman said: “To inform, entertain and give an opinion. They don’t always have to do highbrow analysis or be controversial – there’s a balance to be found.”Match of the Day’s new rotating line up, featuring two women, is a far cry from the days of Jimmy Hill and Des Lynam at the helm. But while leaning in to the change, Chapman and his co-hosts have worked to avoid comparisons to their predecessors.“It helps that we’re all really different from Gary [Lineker], in that he does it with a profile of his own as an England legend,” Cates has said. “It’s a very different career path. An ex-player taking over would be more of a direct comparison.”Explore more on these topicsMatch of the DayGary LinekerBBCSport TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is drawn to the dead stranger’s lanyard and, for reasons he can’t articulate, pops it around his neck.The lanyard reads: Ben Manager. Our hero’s ascent through a sinister corporate system begins.This play, created by Bunkum Ensemble, is this year’s winner of the Pleasance’s Charlie Hartill Fund. Through live scoring, puppetry and experimental PowerPoint presentations, the team build an uncanny office environment that slowly drives Ben to the edge of sanity.The cast, with writer Jack Parris starring as Ben, are clad in run-of-the-mill office wear, even puppet colleague Derp (operated in this performance by Teele Uustani). Mike Coxhead and Adam Boothroyd play the live soundtrack from their cubicle desks. Corporate phrases and cliches – circle back, socialise the news – drip from tongues as Ben tries to convince everyone that he’s supposed to be there, and convince himself that he wants to be.But what is his job? “I’m responsible for … I’m just responsible now!” he tells his mum. It’s soon clear that no one’s really doing anything.Ben himself is a bit of an enigma, emanating a desperation and fragile masculinity that’s heightened by the workplace and sometimes plays a little queasily in the room. There’s commentary on the cruelty of business, hypocrisy of “wellbeing” initiatives, and true value of many modern jobs.The ominous, rumbling soundtrack keeps you on edge and an otherworldly atmosphere builds, compensating for strands where the messaging is a little more muddied. As Ben ascends the corporate ladder, we shift into dystopian sci-fi, where senior management are encouraged to self-actualise in surprising ways. But with Ben now initiated into the cult of work, can he let go of the facade of productivity and his precious lanyard?AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalPuppetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Misgendered by a shop assistant, we find Sam in a department store changing room, squeezing into a dress from which they’re then unable to extricate themselves. How to escape this with some shred of dignity intact? It’s a big-hitting and farcical standup sketch, delivered with such self-deprecating joyfulness by Nicoresti that you almost forget the sensitivity of its subject matter.That’s of a piece with the rest of Baby Doomer, a set that addresses with grace and buoyant humour our host’s wrestle with their gender and mental health. No tub-thumping here, just a high-joke-count hour from an act still learning how to be a woman (and quick to caricature how imperfectly they’re doing so) but cocky about their credentials as trans. It’s a step forward, and towards a more mainstream brand of standup, too, afterCancel Anti Wokeflake Snow Culture, the quirky multimedia offering that established Nicoresti three years ago.Thanks for Being Here review – Ontroerend Goed’s joyful show puts the audience in the spotlightRead moreThe show takes that pressure-cooker changing room experience as a prompt to explore Nicoresti’s life in a Britain not always accommodating to a natal male walking down the street in a skirt suit. To whom might they look for a role model? Nicoresti proposes Sméagol/Gollum, greatly to the amusement of fellow nerds in the front row. Are they aunt Sam to their nephew, or uncle Sam? Should marriage be preferred to a polycule, or would it merely endorse the cis-normative status quo?As if to emphasise Nicoresti’s repositioning as a standup who wouldn’t look out of place on Live at the Apollo, there’s a home-banker routine about having sperm frozen (mirroringTim Key’sandIan Smith’s set pieces elsewhere in town), and another about receiving a walking tour-style induction at the local gym – “as if I’m the king”, says Nicoresti, in a choice image. It’s quite the trick Nicoresti pulls off here, never soft-soaping the challenges of life as a trans woman while making of it an ebullient hour of comedy.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

After becoming emblems of Cool Britannia in the mid-1990s they continued to visit their grandmother Margaret Sweeney, until she died in 2000, to socialise in pubs and, in the case of Liam, go for runs and hikes, including up Croagh Patrick, a Catholic pilgrimage site. “It was cloudy, we couldn’t see much, but he loved it,” said Casey, who accompanied the singer up the peak.When either brother entered a pub, word sometimes spread and drew busloads of fans from around the area, said Casey. “It was my first experience of craziness. But mostly we tried to let them be, to not let them be bugged or bothered.”Charlestown mourned when Oasis broke up in 2009 and it celebratedlast year’s announcementof a reunion tour, which moves to Dublin’s Croke Park stadium this Saturday and Sunday. “There were a lot of relieved human beings around here when we heard they were rekindling things,” Casey said.Over the years the Gallaghers were photographed in pubs, and somebody uploaded avideoof Liam joining a traditional music session at his local, JJ Finan’s, but what won over the locals was a low-key normality at odds with the brothers’ hell-raising image in England.“There was no guitar-smashing and they always made time to chat to staff,” said Donal Healy, a marketing manager forIrelandWest airport, also known as Knock, just outside Charlestown.View image in fullscreenLiam Gallagher displays a T-shirt supporting County Mayo’s Gaelic football team during a visit to Ireland West airport at Knock.Photograph: Ireland West airportHealy’s journalist uncle John Healy wrote the book The Death of an Irish Town, also known asNo One Shouted Stop!, that chronicled his native town’s calamitous decline. That decline was part of a wider phenomenon across rural Ireland, but the local and national population has rebounded since the economy took off in the mid-1990s.The title paraphrases an interviewee in the book who said that no part of Irish society stood up to say that mass emigration was not inevitable.The poverty of the 1960s that drove a teenage Peggy Sweeney to seek work in Manchester – where she married another Irish emigrant, Tommy Gallagher – is no more, said Donal Healy. “For Charlestown it’s nearly come full circle, the fact that we have this connection with the family. We’re in the news for the right reason.”View image in fullscreenA mural in Charlestown recalls John Healy’s landmark book No One Shouted Stop! The Death of an Irish Town.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianExcitement is growing as the concerts approach. Radio stations fill their airwaves withOasissongs and speculation about whether the brothers will make a surprise visit to the town. A football team sang Oasis hits in the town square and a cafe put “Oasis soup” on the menu with the tagline “you get a roll with it” – a reference to their 1995 hit.“People are coming to the town just because of the connection,” said Karena Finn, who showed a photograph of Liam with his son during a visit to her family’s pub, Johnny’s Bar, several years ago.View image in fullscreenAnne and Donald, visitors from Scotland, outside Johnny’s Bar in Charlestown.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianA customer named Anne, an emigrant back in Ireland on holiday, lauded the Gallaghers for nourishing their ties to Ireland. “For all the faults they might have,” she said, “they never forgot their roots.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandOasisLiam GallagherNoel GallagherEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a sort of melodious cacophony of sound.”Clark found the music while researchingBuckland Abbey for the National Trust. Only one book – rather boringly setting out the customs the monks followed – was known to exist, held in the British Library.“I didn’t hold out a great deal of hope it would suddenly open up the lost world of Buckland Abbey,” said Clark. But in the back of the Buckland Book, he came across some leaves of parchment.View image in fullscreenThe Buckland Book, from the 15th century, was found in the British Library.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“Those leaves contained pieces of chant – text and notation. Though there were 800-plus monasteries in medieval England, you can count almost on one hand pieces of music that survived.“The Tudor state scrapped Latin worship and the lyrics and music that went with it were largely discarded. Most of this stuff is lost. But there it was, shoved into the back of the book.”The bulk of the book was written in the 15th century but Clark was able to date the music to the early 16th century. “That made it especially exciting because it transports us to that last generation of monks of the medieval English tradition that had been there for a millennium,” he said.It chimed with another Buckland document from the same era. “By extraordinary serendipity, it turned out to be the contract for the employment of an organist and choirmaster.” His name was Robert Derkeham, and he would have been hired to improve the singing of the dozen monks who lived at Buckland and the local boys brought in to sing the treble parts.Clark said it was clear that, as well as worshipping God, the monastery was trying to impress patrons by creating wonderful music. “Monasteries were competing in a very crowded marketplace for investment from patrons,” he said.“One of the strategies was to upgrade the music. Buckland bought in expertise to turn what may have been a rather ragged choir into something more professional. They were being responsive to cultural change, keeping up with the times and impress their audience.”Derkeham remained at the monastery for more than 15 years, until it was closed and he was pensioned off.Clark said the text was dark. “It is calling out to what we might call an Old Testament God. One calls out to God to defend his people; one says, ‘stay the hand of the avenging angel’; one talks about being in despair.“I like that sense that it carries us back to a moment in time. In our world, medieval religion is becoming ever more difficult for us to grasp. I think this helps us return to an understanding that it was a sensory experience,” said Clark.“If we’re going to do these people who died 500 years ago some sort of justice as historians, we’ve got to understand the world as they saw it and as experienced it.”The book has been loaned to Buckland by the British Library and can be viewed at the abbey.The University of Exeter Chapel Choirwill perform the music livein Buckland Abbey’s medieval Great Barn on 16 and 17 August.Explore more on these topicsChoral musicDevonHeritageChristianityReligionEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Brace for chaosLiv LittleSat 16 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 16 Aug 2025 05.34 EDTShareWhether you’re a devout worshipper at the altar of The Real Housewives (like me), or simply aware of it by osmosis, there’s no denying it’s one of reality TV’s most wildly successful franchises. Since it debuted in 2006 with a peek into Orange county’s elite, the franchise now spansmore than a dozen US citiesand has extended internationally from Sydney to Dubai. Now, nearly 20 years later,London is calling.‘For gays, this is our moon landing’: the unadulterated camp joy of Real HousewivesRead moreDespite its title, the show isn’t really about marriage (most of the women aren’t married, and those who are usually at some point during their tenure experience a messy divorce). What the franchise captures is something far more compelling: a specific sort ofmidlife reinvention. We watch as women (mostly over the age of 40) navigate divorce, grief, success, self-discovery and the pursuit of fame. As the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Brandi Glanville put it: “Andy Cohen [the show’s executive producer] is the only man in Hollywood who hires women over 40.”One of the most enduring qualities of the Real Housewives is that it doesn’t produce throwaway reality stars – it creates cultural icons. Unlike much of reality television, which sees contestants flare up and burn out within a season (or even a few episodes), the Housewives universe invites long-term investment. We follow these women for years (and in the case of Beverly Hills,Atlantaor the OC, for well over a decade) as friendships fracture (always with a healthy amount of drama), marriages begin and end and children grow up (and we can now watch the housewives’ offspring on the spin-off Next Gen NYC). In a genre built on instant gratification and rapid turnover, Housewives rewards patience. It feels less like disposable content and more like weekly event television – something to savour and return to, season after season (and rewatch obsessively).View image in fullscreen‘Bitchy opulence’ … The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.Photograph: Distributor: Bravo Supplier:AETN/Nicole Weingart/BravoThis is how Real Housewives cultivates community. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been at a work event or awkward dinner where the mere mention of the women lights people up – suddenly, you’re not strangers, you’re part of a devoted tribe, debating whether the new New York cast are any good (spoiler: they will never be the same), or reeling from the news that the self-appointed grand dame of Potomac herself, Karen Huger, has been sentenced to prison. Once you’re in, you’re in. And once you’ve found your franchise, there’s no going back.That being said, the Real Housewives ecosystem holds a mammoth vault of episodes and choosing where to start can feel as daunting as it is exciting. The good news is that you can quite literally start anywhere. Each city offers something different, depending on what mood you’re in.Beverly Hills serves bitchy opulence (think Lisa Vanderpump’s blush-pink Villa Rosa). The original New York cast was truly wild – Ramona Singer’s wide-eyed expressions are permanently etched in my memory, and Countess Luann’s song Money Can’t Buy You Class remains a certified banger. Atlanta will have you howling with laughter, delivering some of the best lines in the entire franchise.Then there is The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, which has already cemented its place as one of the franchise’s greatest hits, despite being a newer addition. Largely because the show is based in Utah (the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), it landed a scandal right out of the gate, complete with federal indictments. One of the housewives,Jen Shah, became the centre of national attention following her 2021 arrest and subsequent guilty plea for wire fraud. Forever surrounded by numerous assistants (doing God knows what), Shah projected a lifestyle many suspected was funded by more than just her show salary. The drama drew high-profile fans such as Rihanna. There was also the infamous “How did Heather get a black eye?” mystery. Heather Gay, one of the RHOSLC wives and author of the New York Times bestseller Bad Mormon, later revealed it was allegedly caused by Shah, who is now serving time alongsideElizabeth Holmes(of Theranos fame), and paparazzi have even captured shots of them together in prison.View image in fullscreen‘The best lines in the entire franchise’ … The Real Housewives of Atlanta.Photograph: Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty ImagesMost recently, the show has offered some moments that will tug on even the coldest of heartstrings – particularly involving Mary Cosby (who, yes, famously married her step-grandfather). This season, Cosby’s usually reserved demeanour gave way to vulnerability as her son’s visible struggle with drug addiction unfolded on screen in a way that substance issues had never before been spoken about within the network.My personal greatest love has to be The Real Housewives of Atlanta. It is a masterclass in shade and comedic brilliance. Just look at Phaedra Parks, who serves the coldest reads with the unflappable poise of a lawyer and embalmer (yes, she’s both). Kim Zolciak, the only white woman in the original cast, insisted on wearing weaves. Then there’s Kenya Moore, who was the perfect villain – eventually getting booted due to season 16’s revenge porn debacle – in which she used her haircare launch to allegedly project explicit footage purporting to be of another cast member. Atlanta also introduced the world to NeNe Leakes – one of the rare Housewives to cross over into mainstream entertainment, landing a recurring role on Glee, a stint on The New Normal and Broadway roles in Cinderella and Chicago. She had, and has, actual star power.And what to expect from The Real Housewives ofLondon? Six women from the city’s wealthiest circles (with genuinely pre-existing relationships). Making a return to reality TV is the Ladies of London alum Juliet Angus, the fashion-savvy American who’s already generating excitement among longtime fans. She’s joined by the skincare CEO Amanda Cronin, who may be stepping into the villain role – if the teaser is anything to go by. In one scene, she’s seen yelling: “Go back to Paddington!” and edging close to one of the other wives, though she has described herself as “the light in every room”.There’s the party planner and former pageant queen Juliet Mayhew, and Karen Loderick-Pierce, whose early love of fashion came from her grandfather (part of the Windrush generation), who used to send her clothes from London to Jamaica. Early teasers hint she may emerge as the show’s confessional queen.Rounding out the group is Panthea Parker, who describes the show as “stiff upper lip meets crazy Housewives”. She can apparently drop £140,000 on a single shopping spree without batting a false eyelash. And finally, there’s Nessie Welschinger, a financier turned baker and self-professed tiger mum. The trailer teases high society and even higher drama.The same is true of the extensions to the franchise: the (three-part!) reunions and spin-off shows.View image in fullscreenCircle of strife … The Real Housewives of London.Photograph: Angus Pigott/PROne of the longest-standing cast members of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Kandi Burruss – formerly of the R&B group Xscape (she also co-wrote Bills Bills Bills for Destiny’s Child) – has Kandi & the Gang (featuring her family and restaurant). Meanwhile Zolciak, another original Atlanta housewife, headlined her own spin-off, Don’t Be Tardy, which chronicled her home life with her husband, Kroy Biermann, and their blended family in a more domestic, sitcom-style format.It would be remiss not to mention “Scandoval” fromVanderpump Rules, one of Lisa Vanderpump’s spin-offs, which was quite possibly Bravo’s most viral betrayal to date. Tom Sandoval, a longtime cast member, was caught cheating on his long-term partner, Ariana Madix, with their co-star Raquel Leviss. The drama played out across social media platforms like Instagram, (then) Twitter and dedicated Vanderpump Rules subreddits, on which fans recalled exactly where they were the moment “Scandoval broke”, often noting the precise day and time it dropped. Viewers also debated timelines and theories about how long Sandoval and Leviss had been seeing each other before the reveal, fuelling endless speculation and discussion online. The controversy elevated Madix to almost “god-like” status with brand deals aplenty. It was reality TV at its operatic best.In addition to the spin-offs, the last couple of years have seen frankly drastic makeovers across the franchise. New York ushered in its influencer era – a complete recast featuring younger women with strong social media presences – and has been renewed, cancelled and reportedly renewed (and cancelled) again. Atlanta has welcomed a completely new cast – bringing back OG Porsha Williams and finally elevating her bestie (at least until they appeared on the show together) and longtime “friend of the show” Shamea Morton to full-time cast member with her own intro and storyline. Orange County has blended returning originals such as Shannon Beador and Tamra Judge with newer voices – with some hitting and failing to land.The Real Housewives of London offers those still hungry for yet another universe to lose themselves in – this time, with a completely clean slate. Whether it becomes an instant fan favourite remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: even for those who’ve never sat through a full episode, these women are firmly embedded in the cultural mainstream and thankfully, they’re not going anywhere. The joy of Housewives is that no matter where you begin, it’s never long before you’re all in.The Real Housewives of London is on Hayu in the UK on 18 AugustExplore more on these topicsTelevisionReality TVAtlantaLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Simpsons had redefined what a cartoon could be, Ren & Stimpy and South Park were transgressive thrill-rides. But Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s tale of a washed-up actor chasing redemption wasn’t just adult; it was profound.So I was worried, approaching the new animated series from that show’s creators. It’s not about celebrity. There are no talking dogs or porcupines, or underwater worlds. No Will Arnett. How could I watch without expectation? It feels unfair yet unavoidable to keep an artist’s previous work in mind. Isn’t that like comparing a current partner with an ex?While it lacks a famous horse, Long Story Short (Netflix, from Friday 22 August) is its own beast, and no less ambitious. It’s a family saga told in multiple timelines. The Schwoopers are an argumentative, chaotic Jewish household. Each episode focuses on a character or relationship, swooshing back and forward in time, from the 1950s to the 2020s, as they navigate romance, coming of age, marital breakdown, parenting, old wounds, joy, death and purpose. Basically, it’s Bluey meets Tolstoy.The Jewishness is not incidental. The show is Jewish inside and out, defiantly, delightedly so. Naomi Schwartz is presented as a classic Jewish matriarch, impossibly critical yet overbearingly proud of her children. Daughter Shira is more modern. (“We’re a lesbian couple with biracial, Jewish sons. We’re impressive,” as her partner Kendra puts it.) In the episode Yoshi’s Bar Mitzvah, teenager Danny (voiced by Dave Franco) celebrates his friend’s public speaking. “Dude, your davening was on point!” he hypes. “Mr Leibowitz was kvellin’ like a felon!”It almost goes without saying: melancholy. Most dramas have a primary time and place, flashing back in a limited way. Long Story Short doesn’t privilege any of its periods or people. There is only the equalising process of decades passing or rolling back. The time-hopping is extraordinarily effective, bringing characters back from the dead, fleshing out relationships, grounding us in moral complexity. We feel the painful beauty of our bounded lives.It almost even more goes without saying: funny. Long Story Short delights in language games, subversion, absurdity and surprise. Hapless Yoshi gets conned into becoming a salesman for explosive mattresses in a tube. (Yes, there’s a soft launch.) Avi’s daughter Hannah’s school has been invaded by wolves, but no one seems concerned. Kendra and Shira have a dog, named the Undeniable Isadora Duncan. I guess there are animals in this one.View image in fullscreenCritical thinking … (from left) Edelstein with Max Greenfield as Yoshi Schwooper and Paul Reiser as Elliot Cooper in Long Story Short.Photograph: NetflixCharacters talk a mile a minute, particularly at the Schwoopers’ dinner table, and it takes a while to key into the frenetic pace. ButBoJack Horsemanalso took a minute to find its hooves. (In fact, the first season improved so drastically in its second half, website IndieWire changed its reviewing strategy to only award scores after watching entire seasons.) Here, I was locked in by the second episode. It’s rare for me to actually LOL, watching comedies. But I did, repeatedly – such as when Shira is flummoxed by a reCAPTCHA asking her to pick out squares containing bisexuals. (“How am I supposed to …?”) Kendra is unimpressed. “Where are your glasses? It says bicycles.” But above all, it’s beautiful. The show is interested in the moments when one’s heart splits open. The final scene of an episode in which Kendra attends shul for mercenary reasons pierced me with its humanity.The poignancy is baked into its innovative structure, reminding me of the Sondheim musicalMerrily We Roll Along, perhaps a little ofPachinkoand the film Boyhood. It wears its formal brilliance lightly, and at 10 episodes of 30 minutes, Long Story Short doesn’t outstay its welcome. It’s rewarding company, even if you don’t catch everyFiddler on the Roofreference. I’m glad it’s already been renewed. As with loved ones I have lost, I want more time.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherAnimation on TVBoJack HorsemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Several landmark novels about climate apocalypse and survivalism had been published, includingZ for Zachariahby Robert C O’Brien andThe Death of Grassby John Christopher, but there was no imperative to write about such things. These stories involved anomalistic catastrophes – a mutated virus, nuclear war – and they were very bleak. They resonated but also seemed unusual. At the other end of the scale, Ben Elton’s Stark had comedically outlined the nature of oligarchic greed, resource consumption, and the ruination we were hurtling towards, while the Bezos and Musk equivalents could head off-world – not quite so funny now.The public knew about climate issues, though terminology often stressed them individually – ozone depletion, greenhouse warming, desertification, coral bleaching – rather than total Earth systems breakdown. Disparate, visionary science fictions didn’t indicate a genre movement yet. There was a luxury of choice regarding stories related to nature – no elephant in the room (or polar bear), if you didn’t tackle climate-change concerns.In the 2000s, while the scientific data was righting itself from hacks and attacks, a whole spate of alarming nonfiction books arrived, forecasting the devastating effect of global temperature rises, mass extinctions, and the chaotic world that would occur if our trajectory of fossil fuel consumption, industrial farming, deforestation and the like wasn’t altered. Books likeSix Degrees(Mark Lynas),A World Without Bees(Alison Benjamin and Brian McCallum), and Half Gone (Jeremy Leggett) sounded the doom gong, loudly.As a news-hungry novelist, I responded, wringing jeopardy from these predictions to create a dire, possible future. Full-throttle dystopian speculation seemed to be appropriate. I wroteThe Carhullan Army, which imagines female paramilitary resistance in a Britain destabilised by flooding and politically fascistic, where rationing and population control are the new norms. Looking back, I can see this story arrived out of pure, exhilarated fear about impending ecological disaster, the repressive systems which could arise out of it and their effect, especially, on women. It was an attempt to ring the same warning bell, to create a virtual, experiential realm for the reader out of their propositions.Fiction writers were turning towards the situation. Cormac McCarthy’sThe Road, perhaps the most horrific, cataclysmic fable of this era, while never explicitly naming its disaster, depicts, as George Monbiotnoted, the extreme consequences of “a world without a biosphere”. A decade later,The End We Start Fromby Megan Hunter, imagines a saturated, desolated England, with migration south to north as characters struggle to control their lives. Water shortages, drought and expanding sands feature in Claire Vaye Watkins’ novel,Gold Fame Citrus, where countercultural Californians try to get to grips with a brutal new wilderness almost too big for human comprehension. Too big for comprehension, regarding the world’s threatened environmental state, would become our existential sufferance.View image in fullscreen‘Utopia is difficult to write about’ … Sarah Hall in the Lake District.Photograph: Kat GreenThese issues were not, in fact, speculative, but live around the globe. The ensuing havoc and damages do not affect humans equally. The racial extrapolation of history and culture in relation to climate future is depicted in Tochi Onyebuchi’sGoliath. In it, the abandoned black population of an uninhabitable, cloud-shrouded America search for meaning, home, and connection. Who will suffer and how when the apocalypse descends as a result of society’s legacy, is one of the fundamental concerns. If there are positive human adaptations or consolations to be found in these stories, they are transitory, vestigial or futile – distantly circling birds, an orphan fostered in hell, precarious love, sorority. Hope is dwarfed or excoriated by the monstrous new reality of planetary vastation. Tracking forward from Mary Shelley’sThe Last Man, anxiety around the loss of our habitat and safe, humane civilisation has been the operating key for dystopia.Cli-fi is now its own genre, and booming, its themes curated on bookshops tables. But is pessimism still the prevailing mood? Utopia, it’s said, is difficult to write and perhaps less interesting to read. “Whoever tries to imagine perfection simply reveals his own emptiness,” George Orwell asserted. Darkness is attractive in so far as it’s inherently dramatic to depict, provocative and recognisable. In the face of failure to politically cooperate, legislate and mitigate against Earth systems breakdown, nature-horror and environmental comeuppance might truly represent our feelings of fatalism. Perhaps dystopia serves a purpose, as a repellent. It’s difficult to know whether it acts as a cautionary tale, deterring people from its pathways, or whether it simply provides disturbing entertainment while endorsing the worst-case scenario.But is Orwell’s philosophy correct? Or might the premise be learned incapacity, a defeatist ideology that commits us to mess and devilry, rather than nurturing anything better? Might it hinder solution stories and contribute to a negative cultural paralysis?One man’s utopia is very different from the next woman’s. There have always been positive proposals in science fiction, too, such as the formidable work ofOctavia Butler, which opposes the notion of destructive tendencies in our species and dares to dream up models of evolution. The narratives ofAfrofuturismrise from experiences unlike Orwell’s, exploring themes of black identity and agency and offering alternative, empowered versions of the future. Who is to say what literature can’t be or do?So what is the fiction that needs to be written now? This is the question I grappled with over the decades of writing my novelHelm. Is it about signposting progress when it comes to environmental adaptation and damage limitation? Should writers try to offer a restorative or rousing spirit for the times we live in, an opposition to eschatology? Can literature actually be a tool to encourage something better – creating eco-topia on the page, so it might be imagined off it? Midway through the writing of the book, I took part in a British Council Nature Writing panel in Germany and this last question was asked by the audience. Robert Macfarlane, the chair, barely paused before saying: yes. I remained silent.Since the dystopian days, I had tried a hopeful version of environmental fiction, The Wolf Border, which is about nature recovery and the rewilding of Britain. A good kind of What If scenario, I’d thought. But its premise and its political conditions – Scottish independence and radical land reform – seem more fantastical and remote now than when it was written. The truth is, as I sat quietly on that panel, I felt corseted by old ideas about fiction: that gloom is our territory, that fabricators have a different role to factualists, that novelists aren’t obliged to help steer society out of a negative mindset. My luxury to choose an environmental mode felt hollow.For nonfiction writers, the presentation of issues and ideas is central. They encourage literal engagement with a subject. They can brilliantly advocate, use literature to protest and campaign for conservation. They might move the dial politically, like Rachel Carson’sSilent Springdid, prompting the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. They can reconstruct biased, racialised environments as the cultural geographer Carolyn Finney does. In her book Black Faces, White Spaces, she examines the relationships between African Americans and the natural world, white privilege, historical access to and ownership of the great outdoors, broadening perspectives on the environmental justice movement.With fiction, it is harder to present issues without it being on-the-nose; there are so many moving parts in a virtual world: characters, plots,landscapes, themes. A story might foreground the environment, it might even beaboutthe environment, but it isn’t a manifesto. It is galvanising to see writers such as Monbiot tackling the issues behind industrialism that drive pollution and depletion – neoliberalism, capitalism, the internalised narratives that make us believe consumer economic systems are set and unchangeable – then suggest alternatives. I’ve been struck too readingWild Fellby Lee Schofield, which imagines the future blossoming of ecological work he’s undertaken in the same location where Haweswater and The Carhullan Army are set. I was struck, because I’d never imagined an optimistic vision for my home turf; it seemed like a literary gear I didn’t possess.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

These works begin to overcome the immense scale of fatalism.So can fiction.The Overstoryby Richard Powers demonstrates the genuine power of collectives in the fight to protect nature. Barbara Kingsolver’sFlight Behaviourfinds, alongside the shocking planetary transformation affecting all species, a beauty in transition. These novels invite scientists to shout louder and readers to participate more.This became the imperative for Helm. It is a book about a unique aerial phenomenon, Britain’s only named wind, far older than humans and perhaps imperilled because of us. After more than a decade of stalls, rewrites and re-examinations of the topic, I had begun wondering if I should imagine ways up and out of doom scenarios instead of just describing the conflict within them. The answer was yes.The novel tackles issues of climate change, but its tenor is different. Perhaps the very nature of its subject helped: air, levity, mercurial otherness. Nature narrating itself is not new in literature, but remembering that our human story is not separate from nature’s story is timely. The wind, whose biography the book attempts to capture, is a mischievous puckish storyteller, entertained by humans and impervious to its own destruction, so the tone is a bit “tea-party at end-times”. A beautiful indifference is one option for dealing with environmental ruin, if you’ve no agency to alter it. But the character of Selima, a contemporary meteorological researcher studying microplastics in clouds, is more serious and culpable. Selima has the weight of awful facts on her shoulders, along with interference from climate deniers. Her existential crisis is, I think, a version of what we all may feel as isolated individuals, given the overwhelming issues we face. Yet she remains defiant and collegiate; she keeps on going with her work. The end of her story is still speculative, but it leaves room for activism to triumph.There are lots of stories in the novel about how mankind has tried to control the elements over millennia, via industry and religion; how we’ve consumed and damaged nature as our “manifest destiny”. But there are also stories about ways of existing holistically, recognising our place in nature and its place in us. These are mostly the female characters’ stories; they prevail against bad operators, and they are companionable with Helm.The Helm’s-eye overview gives a whimsical perspective of human endeavour, our significant anthropogenic moment on the planet, our solipsism and minimalism in the scheme of things, and a sense of: what next? This allowed for a fundamental shift in spirit towards buoyancy and a rescaling. In the end, it felt as meaningful and right to try to imagine positive countervailing ideas around our ecological impact as the dystopias had previously felt.Helm is far from eco-topia. But I hope the book is a constructive offering for our current moment. I’ve always believed fiction can be vital in allowing readers to apprehend and experience other versions of the world. I’m starting to believe it can play a part in encouraging healthier visions of the environment, by depicting our benign proclivities, and imagining that marvellous natural phenomena like the Helm wind can be saved.Explore more on these topicsBooksScience and nature booksClimate crisisFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But really it’s a last chance to fix mistakes: ropey backing vocals; mistimed bass notes; a banjo part played with an out‑of-tune B string.“I can easily redo it,” I say, thinking: I don’t even remember playing it in the first place.“You only hit that string a couple of times,” says George, the engineer. “I can probably edit it.”“As always, I prefer solutions that don’t involve me doing anything,” I say.The guitarist, meanwhile, is compiling a list of potential album titles. Whenever he comes up with one, he hands me his notepad and insists I add one of my own.“Don’t ask me to explain my thinking,” I say, handing it back.“There are no bad ideas at this stage,” he says.George loads another song. It begins gently, with guitar and vocals, building across the second verse and first chorus to a swelling instrumental interlude. Then it drops down again.“I think it needs something else coming in there,” I say.“I agree,” says George.“Something different, maybe a bit nautical,” says the guitar player.“Ship’s harmonium?” I say, feeling clever.“That sort of thing,” says the guitar player.“OK,” says George. “Let’s mike up the harmonium.”“Shit,” I say. “I forgot you had one.”“Good luck,” says the guitar player.I don’t know if the studio’s old harmonium has been on a ship, but it looks the part. Two big foot pedals operate the bellows that push the air across the reeds, and they creak when you step on them. I recall trying to play this instrument once before, years ago. I also recall we didn’t use any of it, because it sounded terrible.“Don’t touch any of the knobs,” says George through my headphones. “It barely works as it is.”“I won’t,” I say.The first take is a disaster. I forget what key the song is in. I can see everyone laughing through the glassThe first take is disastrous. I forget what key the song is in. By the time I chance upon the correct answer – D major – the eight bars are over.When I finish I can see everyone laughing through the glass, but George graciously does not press the switch that would allow me to hear it until they’ve stopped.“A few mistakes,” he says.“I’m not a recognised harmonium player,” I say.“This is gonna work!” says the guitar player.“It can only get better,” says George. “I’ll drop you in the same place.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But if I pump faster than the song it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to keep time.“How did they do this on ships?” I say.“Would it help,” says the fiddle player, “if I did the pedals for you?”“I don’t know,” I say. “Maybe.”The fiddle player barges me over on the bench, plugging in a second pair of headphones.“Don’t listen to the song,” I say. “It makes it worse.” He takes the headphones off.“Two bars and in,” says George.Tim Dowling: the old dog snorted with delight – and then she was gone | Tim DowlingRead moreAt my signal, the fiddle player begins to pump furiously. In my headphones it sounds like someone climbing the stairs in a haunted house. But when I press the keys, the notes come through loud and bright. As we progress, it gets louder. And louder. I think: he’s over-pumping! I stop before the end.“Sorry,” I say. “I thought the harmonium was going to explode.”“Ha ha!” says the fiddle player.We do eight further takes in three‑legged-race fashion: one pedalling, one playing, the harmonium slipping up and down in volume, and the fiddle player laughing out loud whenever I make a mistake. In the end, George glues the front half of one take to the back half of another, and we have a part.As this sleight of hand is taking place, our trumpet player walks in.“Hey,” she says. “How’s it going?”“Just, you know, adding harmonium to everything,” I say. The guitar player hands her his list.“Album titles,” he says. “Read and add.” She scans the list in silence.“We’re still at the no-bad-ideas stage,” I say.“Evidently,” she says.Explore more on these topicsMusicThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our tent is pitched between two strips of woodland, which provide just enough shade. To complete the sense of calm wonderment: for 24 hours, we have this piece of land completely to ourselves.Essentially, we are wild camping, but in a reassuringly managed way. Our spot has been arranged byCampWild, an adventure outfit that started in 2023and has about 200 approved locations on its books.View image in fullscreenA few days before setting off, we are sent our first “route card”, complete with a map, a few warnings (“there is a high risk of midges and ticks in this area”), and the promise of “a sheltered meadow-woodland space ideal for roaming”. Then comes the start of this long weekend: just after lunchtime, I set out on a three-mile walk from a nearby car park with my son James, 18, and daughter Rosa, 16, arriving at our destination in the late afternoon in searing heat. We have made sure to bring three vital litres of water. Once our tent is pitched and the evening’s relative cool arrives, what we half expect materialises: a lovely feeling of time ceasing to matter, which runs through an evening spent eating dinner (the obligatory instant pasta), aimlessly rambling around our surroundings, then marvelling at a sky much starrier than any to be seen in a town or city.View image in fullscreenWaiting for dinner … John with Rosa and JamesOne of CampWild’s rules is that locations must be kept secret, in case word gets out and they are overrun with unauthorised campers. This much I can say: the land we are staying on is part of a regenerative farm that claims to produce 167 varieties of food, and whose proprietors are enthusiastic rewilders and tree-planters. Its co-owner, Kate Hughes, tells me she welcomes campers because “if we don’t have people on the land, they won’t fight for nature: we have to have a relationship as a nation with the natural world that supports us”.For many people, spending a night or two this way can seem daunting: CampWild aims to give them a bit of guidance and hand-holdingOur somewhat limited knowledge of bird calls suggests that we are in the company of wood pigeons, one or two sparrowhawks and an abundance of blackbirds. We are half hoping to see a deer or two, but although none materialise, it hardly matters – this feels like somewhere teeming with life.Somewhat inevitably, James and Rosa spend time on their phones, but we soon agree on a compromise: 90 minutes spent listening on a Bluetooth speaker to suitably pastoral music – Nick Drake, Fairport Convention, the acoustic demos for the Beatles’ White Album – before a final hour of stillness and silence, when we begin to drift off to sleep. James has always been much better suited to staying outdoors than in (his first recorded lie-in happened on a Dorset campsite when he was five). So it proves tonight. By 11pm, he is slumbering, while Rosa and I stay awake for another half hour.View image in fullscreenCamping con fusilliCampWild was founded by Alex Clasper and Tom Backhouse, thirtysomething dads whose lifelong passion for the outdoor life was ignited on camping trips arranged by their Devon comprehensive school. Several years after they first met, Backhouse’s sister was involved in a serious car accident, which led him to do a sponsored trek around all of the UK’s national parks to raise money for the air ambulance service that rescued her.Clasper accompanied him on some of these adventures, which involved a good deal of wild camping and sparked a revelation. “Escaping, getting off grid and spending time in nature was almost like therapy,” Clasper tells me, a few days before I set off. “Sitting under the stars for the evening – that’s where we’ve had some of our deepest and most important conversations.”View image in fullscreenSome happy aimless rambling …For many people, spending a night or two this way can seem daunting:CampWild’s essential modus operandi, Clasper says, is to “give them the confidence and knowledge and knowhow: a bit of guidance and hand-holding”. And what they offer has chimed with the zeitgeist in two ways. Over the past two and a half years, awareness of wild camping has rocketed, thanks partly to the legal tussle between the Dartmoor landowner Alexander Darwall and Right to Roam activists,which was finally settled– in the latter’s favour – by the supreme court in May.At the same time, the collective yearning for nature, manifested in a deluge of books about hares, footpaths and rivers, has surely accelerated CampWild’s growth. It now has about 4,000 members, who pay a £25 annual fee – £1 of which goes to the environmental charityRewilding Britain– and are charged about £15 per stay, with fees going to the landowner.As we drive home, I can feel the meditative calm the weekend brought me still lingeringAnother rule, aimed at gently enforcing meticulous standards on litter and mess, is that campers must take a before-and-after photo of their spot, and mail it to CampWild within 24 hours. But one question, Clasper tells me, always comes up: what to do about the most basic human functions? Poos must be bagged up and disposed of elsewhere: “There are a couple of spaces that do allow, er …digging, but most don’t fall into that category.” By way of highlighting roughly how to do it, CampWild has a sponsorship agreement with a brand calledDicky Bag, which offers reusable receptacles – usually marketed at dog-owners – with “odour proof seams and seals”. Free weeing, needless to say, is allowed, providing it is done well away from what Clasper calls “water sources”.View image in fullscreenHome from home … Rosa making campBack in our field, we wake after 7am, and slowly make our way into a morning gripped by more heat. The route back to the car, along a mixture of tree-lined roads and field paths, passes through the Somerset village of Roadwater, where we are offered a lovely kind of respite. Every other month, there is a community breakfast in the village hall, and a meal for the three of us costs little more than £20. We split the afternoon between the village of Porlock and tourist-filled Lynmouth and Lynton, before the temperature begins to ease. We then set off on a 20-minute drive along isolated Exmoor roads, during which a huge deer vaults on to the tarmac 10 metres in front of us and then disappears into the countryside beyond.This evening’s sleeping spot is stunning. In an area reportedly popular with people walking from Land’s End to John o’Groats, it lies half a mile or so beyond a huge campsite whose residents enjoy snooker-table lawns. Our chosen spot, by contrast, is the knobbly ground in a steep-sided stretch of the Exe valley, directly under a pyramid-shaped hill. The river is right next to us: six or seven metres wide, scattered with pebbled islands. The night sky is particularly vivid: James once again falls asleep almost instantly, while Rosa and I manoeuvre our heads next to the tent door and stare up, half-convinced we might be in the presence of UFOs, before we realise they are – obviously – distant planes, presumably en route to Bristol airport.As we drive home, I can feel the meditative calm the weekend brought me still lingering, along with the sense that this bucolic version of Airbnb is going to become even more popular. “We want to get 1 million people across the UK out into these spaces, experiencing nature and slowing down,” Clasper tells me. I slightly worry that those imagined multitudes might get in the way of all that gorgeous quiet, but it might just happen.Annual membership ofCampWildis £25Explore more on these topicsCamping holidaysSomerset holidaysWalking holidaysFamily holidaysEngland holidaysDevon holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Others, such as this one, are more challenging. But imagine this: seared aubergines cooked with sweet onions and tomatoes, spiced with aromatics such as cardamom, chilli, mustard seeds and smoky curry leaves, then melted into a pot with rice, water and time, until wetter than a risotto but less homogeneous than a congee. A perfect meal to cook on a cool summer’s evening to slow yourself down, both to stoke an appetite and to warm the belly.Brothy and spiced aubergine and tomato riceFresh curry leaves are now sold in most large supermarkets, so never settle for dried ones. Box or wrap any you don’t use and freeze for another time; much the same applies to green finger chillies, too.Prep15 minCook1 hrServes49 tbsp rapeseed oil2 medium aubergines(600g), cut into 3cm x 3cm dice2 tsp fine sea salt2 red onions, peeled and thinly sliced30 fresh curry leaves2 green cardamom pods, lightly bashed5 garlic cloves, peeled and minced360g cherry tomatoes, halved250g arborio rice1 tsp black mustard seeds2 green finger chillies, stalks discarded, the rest finely choppedPour three tablespoons of the oil into your widest nonstick frying pan and set it on a high heat. When the oil is very hot, add half the aubergines, sprinkle over a quarter-teaspoon of salt and cook, stirring often, for about eight minutes, until browned on the outside and nearly cooked through (ie, not completely soft). Transfer to a large plate, add another three tablespoons of oil to the pan and repeat with the second batch of aubergines and another quarter-teaspoon of salt.Heat a tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan and, once it’s hot, add the onions, half the curry leaves, all the crushed cardamom and a teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until soft, then add the garlic and cook for two minutes more.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Put the fried aubergines and the onion mix in a large pot (keep the frying pan for later), add the halved tomatoes and cook on a medium heat for four minutes, until they’re starting to soften. Measure a litre of water into a jug or pan and have it ready by the side of the stove. Add the rice and the final half-teaspoon of salt to the aubergine mix, stir in a third of the water, then leave it to bubble away on a medium heat for about eight minutes, until the rice has soaked up the liquid. Add another third of the water, cook for another eight minutes, so the rice sucks that up, too, then add the final slug of water and cook for a final five minutes – the rice should be soupy.Put two tablespoons of oil in the frying pan on a medium heat and, when it’s very hot, add the mustard seeds, chillies and remaining curry leaves. Cook for two minutes, pour all over the rice and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodVegan food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkRiceTomatoesSri Lankan food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

My mum bought them in the 1980s and 90s, but they were never nice, and sometimes resembled cardboard. I’ve always assumed they were among the most processed foods on the planet, so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, taste and even health scores of the brands tested here, which I assessed using theYuka app. Most are low in salt, sugar and saturated fat, and had relatively simple recipe formulas.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While a few brands included concerning ingredients – such as disodium diphosphate and artificial flavourings – most use a blend of sunflower and rapeseed oil, with no hazardous additives. However, nearly all contained a small amount of dextrose, a sugar that feels unnecessary here, not least because potatoes already have a natural sweetness. Just two brands were dextrose-free, earning them an extra point.To improve crunch and texture, many brands coat their chips in a mix of flours and starches, typically wheat, rice, maize or pea flour, and sometimes with raising agents. Though not essential, these coatings contribute to golden, crisp exteriors that, when done well, enhance the chip; done badly, however, they bring a slightly processed edge. Overall, the results of this test were genuinely impressive, so much so, in fact, that I’m now planning to develop my own version of oven chips at home.There wasn’t much to go on regarding sustainability, although I awarded a point where products disclosed the variety and origin of the potatoes used. Some highlighted their use of maris pipers – a classic chip variety prized for its high starch and low moisture content, creating that ideal fluffy interior and crunchy exterior. Every bag I tested was packaged in LDPE 4 plastic or similar, which is recyclable only in-store, so a missed opportunity for more accessible recycling.The best oven chipsBest all-rounder:Morrisons the Best triple-cooked skin-on chipsView image in fullscreen£2.85 for 750g at Morrisons (38p/100g)★★★★★Rich, savoury flavour with a crisp, golden, skin-on exterior and fluffy interior. Excellent texture and thick cut. Coated in maize, rice, pea flour and dextrose. Made with British potatoes. Gluten-free. Remarkable value.Best bargain:Tesco home-style straight-cut oven chipsView image in fullscreen£2.65 for 950g at Tesco (28p/100g)★★★☆☆Golden brown and very long, which is quite fun. A chewy yet crunchy exterior and sweet, earthy flavour with hints of baked potato. British potatoes coated in rice and maize flour with modified starches. Gluten-free and outstanding value.And the rest:Waitrose No 1 frozen triple-cooked chipsView image in fullscreen£3.25 for 750g at Waitrose (43p/100g)★★★★☆A perfectly even, golden exterior and lovely, chunky shape. Really tasty, with rich, umami-laden notes from the beef fat. The coating includes potato, maize starch, and rice and pea flours, but it’s well-executed and contributes to a satisfying crunch. Gluten-free. Pricey, but still reasonable value.Strong Roots proper chipsView image in fullscreen£3.75 for 750g at Ocado (50p/100g)★★★★☆Skin-on and beautifully browned with a chunky cut. Fluffy and delicious with a clean, simple flavour because of the refreshingly short ingredients list – these are just maris piper potatoes and sunflower oil, so they are gluten- and dextrose-free. The only chip to earn an extra sustainability point due to Strong Roots’ B Corp status. More expensive than many others, but fair value given the ethical credentials.Koffmann’s classic chunky chipsView image in fullscreen£3.50 for 800g at Ocado (44p/100g)★★★★☆Fresh-tasting, homemade feel and a clean flavour.

Remarkable to see just two ingredients (potatoes and oil), not least because at this price point processed foods often have more complex formulas. Gluten-free and dextrose-free, too. Incredible for the money.Birds Eye crispy chipsView image in fullscreen£2.48 for 900g at Asda (28p/100g)£2.50 for 900g at Tesco (28p/100g)★★★☆☆Golden, thanks to the addition of turmeric and pepper extract. A moreish, savoury-sweet flavour with enjoyable crunch (because of the bicarb, potato starch and rice flour coating). Closer to a french fry than a classic chip. Contains disodium diphosphate, a phosphate additive that some may wish to avoid. Gluten-free.M&S home-style chipsView image in fullscreen£2.80 for 1kg at Ocado (28p/100g)★★☆☆☆Classic golden chip shop-style chip with a clean, vegetal flavour, crunchy coating and moist centre. British potatoes coated in wheat, corn and rice flour batter. Not my favourite, but excellent value and one of the rare dextrose-free products.Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference chunky chipsView image in fullscreen£3.50 for 1.2kg at Sainsbury’s (29p/100g)★★☆☆☆Thick-cut and well-browned with a soft, slightly oily interior. Sweet but not especially flavourful. Dusted with flours for added crunch. One of the only products detailing origin and potato variety (these are made with British maris pipers). Good value but not as tasty as I’d expected. Contain gluten, too.Aunt Bessie’s crispy skin-on home-style chipsView image in fullscreen£3.40 for 800g at Ocado (43p/100g)£3.90 for 800g at Sainsbury’s (49p/100g)★★☆☆☆Beautiful colour and long cut with a welcome crunchy and fluffy texture. However, the flavour feels a little artificial and less natural than many of the others, and these contain artificial flavourings, too, so with superior products at lower prices, I’d shop elsewhere. Gluten-free.Explore more on these topicsChips (french fries)The FilterPotatoesFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"
